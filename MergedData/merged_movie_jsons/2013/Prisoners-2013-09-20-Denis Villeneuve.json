            "content": "A few words of warning about \"Prisoners\" before you try watching it. It's a very intense, violent and disturbing movie to say the least. While it is ranked #190 on IMBD's Top 250, it's NOT a film for everyone. . I mention this just to warn you...to think about this before you watch.As for me, while this isn't the sort of film I normally would watch, it's one I decided to see because it stars Jake Gyllenhaal. He's an actor who takes lots of risks and has appeared in many unique films which I enjoyed, such as \"Source Code\", \"Nightcrawler\", and \"Donnie Darko\". In fact, I cannot think of any conventional movies he's made...and you know you're in for a few surprises when you see his films...and this definitely is no exception.The story begins with two families having a dinner party. However, partway through the evening, the parents notice that the two youngest kids are gone. Where could they be?! The search the neighborhood but find no trace. The only clue is a tenuous one...a beat up RV was seen parked nearby.The police soon locate the RV and the driver. Instead of exiting the vehicle when the police order him out, he tries to run and is soon apprehended. It seems very likely the guy knows SOMETHING but since there's no real evidence, the police are forced to let him go. Unfortunately, the father of one of the abducted girls (Hugh Jackman) isn't going to let this go....and he abducts the man and keeps him prisoner...trying to get information from him. This portion is not for the squeamish.In the meantime, Detective Loki (Gyllenhaal) has found leads on two other suspects. One is a priest with a corpse in his basement. Another is a freak who likes to buy childrens' clothing and who was first noticed at a vigil for the girls. He won't talk but keeps drawing mazes for the police....mazes that look like the necklace found on the corpse...and mazes which were mentioned by the man in captivity to his captor! All three are obsessed with mazes...so what has this to do with the missing girls?!The best thing about this film is that the screenplay is impossible to predict. If anyone tells you they could predict it, they're lying! Seriously! I appreciate a film that keeps me guessing and this one sure did. As for the acting, with Jackman and Gyllenhaal it's of course excellent. Overall, an amazing film...and an amazingly hard one to watch as well. It's certainly NOT for the squeamish!",

            "content": "If you think of someone being a prisoner, you automatically might think of someone behind bars. But apart from a physical prison, a prisoner can also be trapped mentally, either by his own doing or by someone else. This movie that starts off pretty light gets very heavy. And it is carried by its actors. Gyllenhalls characters might seem odd and out of place at the beginning, even like a cardboard cutout. But he does have more to do as the movie progresses.Still front row seat is Hugh Jackman. And while some might argue that a female should have a bigger role in this, you only have so much time to tell a story. And this is perfectly told and cut together. It might not fit your description of entertainment (and I don't think the filmmaker would love it described as such), but the movie is really great. If you like dramas in general you should be cherishing this .... and you will.We have a few grey areas that we visit and the ending did not satisfy everyone (I know from friends). But the movie could not have ended any other way (in my book). Superb movie one of the best released in 2013",

            "content": "Two very good actors ply their trade very well. Jake Gyllanhaal plays a policeman who is utterly driven in his quest to find two kidnapped little girls. Hugh Jackman plays a survivalist who \"prays for the best but expects the worst.\" During Thanksgiving dinner, two little girls go up to a rusty old RV and shortly thereafter, disappear. The prime suspect is a mentally handicapped young man, the driver of the RV. But the girls are nowhere to be found. He is held for 48 hours and then released. It is then that Jackman takes matters into his own hands. He kidnaps the young man and, convinced he knows everything, tortures him and beats him for days. Meanwhile, another suspect arises but Jackman can't handle this and keeps pounding away. There are numerous twists and turns that seem to work well. Gyllanhaal is a troubled guy himself who has some anger issues that he keeps under wraps. I had not heard of this film and it was a treat to view it.",

            "content": "Prisoners (2013) **** (out of 4) Incredibly well-made and intense mystery about two little girls who go missing and the detective (Jake Gyllenhaal) put on the case to find them. When the original suspect (Paul Dano) is let go, one of the girl's father (Hugh Jackman) decides to take justice in his own hands. I really had high hopes going into PRISONERS and my expectations for a great film were met but I must admit that it wasn't anywhere near the type of great film I expected. A lot of thrillers these days are limited on talk and emotions and instead we just get one big, staged action scene after another. That's certainly not the case here because the film takes its time (153-minutes) telling its story and there are so many quiet moments where we just see the characters losing their grip and emotions as they try to make sense of not knowing where these two girls are. What really pushes the film over the edge are the terrific performances with Jackson leading the way in what's the best performance I've seen from him. This isn't your \"loving\" father in the traditional sense. Instead he's someone quite scary from the first time we see him and we see how much worse he gets as the picture goes along. While on one hand you sympathize with his situation, on the other hand you really can't support what he's doing and often wonderful about his own involvement in things. Jackman really comes off like a man full of emotion and rage and he just doesn't know how to properly let it out. The anger he shows throughout the film is something so raw that you really do feel as if you're watching a man who has a daughter missing. Gyllenhaal also deserves a lot of credit for the way he played the detective role. I really loved the various obstacles that his character gets put through and especially the own weakness and at times stuck-up approach. The supporting cast includes wonderful performances by Dano, Melissa Leo, Terrence Howard, Maria Bello and Viola Davis. The screenplay isn't going to give you a lot of easy answers and there are many times where you hate the lead characters and can't find anything in them to root for. I thought it was quite brave that the film was willing to take so many chances and it asks the viewer to ask themselves many questions about how they would react to what's going on. I can't say I agreed with all the choices but it's great that a film actually makes you think as that's something quite rare these days. PRISONERS isn't exactly an \"enjoyable\" film as it has you feeling dirty throughout the running time but if you stick with it the thing is certainly very rewarding.",

            "content": "I didn't realize until I came to some of the reviews for this movie that it was two and a half hours long. It didn't seem like that while watching as one gets so engrossed in the story that time manages to fly by pretty quickly.I thought the plotting for the film was nearly flawless. The one thing I found exception to was when Detective Loki (Jake Gylenhaal) got distracted by the phone call from the department store clerk, he left Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) in the abandoned house and never bothered to return in a timely fashion. He had pretty good instincts about something going on there, so a quicker follow up would have been expected.Otherwise, I thought the screenplay and director Denis Villeneuve crafted an intricately weaved mystery surrounding the missing girls, with an abduction history going back a quarter of a decade. Those who find Keller's kidnapping of Alex Jones (Paul Dano) distasteful and his subsequent beating of Alex brutal, I'd have to agree that it was beyond the pale for a movie treatment. The beating part anyway. You could understand the man's frustration, but having no success in getting any information, he should have backed off long before he did.But even that part of it was handled well. Loki conceded to Grace Dover (Maria Bello) that her husband would probably go to jail, so there was no getting around the idea that Keller would get away with what he did. For his part, Gyllenhaal displayed another nuanced character in Detective Loki, just about a hundred eighty degree turn from his depiction of news gatherer Lou Bloom in \"Nightcrawler\". There were times he showed remarkable restraint dealing with Keller, making me think about the way cops in real life situations have to hold back on their emotions when dealing with distraught victims of a crime. He and the rest of the supporting cast put in very credible performances.",

            "content": "Prisoners is a gritty, incredibly well-acted, suspenseful, thought-provoking crime drama thriller. The film mainly focus on the choices taken and the consequences faced by the characters when worst things happen to them.It simply raises the question: When your kid's life is at stake, how far are you willing to do to protect your family? It explores the likelihood of human behaviour when such crime is happening to us, blurring the lines between good and bad people.For a 153 minute movie, the story does unfolds at a slow and solemn pace (which hurts the film and might bore some audiences) but the dramatic scenes performed by the main cast members in the film will keep you engaged. Hugh Jackman and Jack Gyllenhaal both giving intense, Oscar-worthy performances here, defining and developing their characters with various layers of emotions: affection, anger, grief, empathy, guilt...throughout the film.The film's atmosphere, heavy rains, stormy days and icy cold winter managed to create a dark, dreadful environment to make up the dreary and haunting mood in the film. Every violent action taken by the characters are acts of desperation given that they are running out of time.However, the film is not perfect. Despite some plot problems from the various twists and turns shown in the film, the superb performances from the casts was sufficient enough to make the story succeed and believable.Highly recommended for those who wanted to watch a serious drama thriller with powerful, engaging acting performances from its talented casts.http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2013/09/movie-review-prisoners.html",

            "content": "There is a sensitivity that Director Denis Villenueve and writer Aaron Guzikowski inhabit in bringing their newest film \"Prisoners\" from Warner Bros. to the screen. Starring an Academy Award nominated cast that includes Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Terence Howard, Maria Bello, Viola Davis, Oscar-winner Melissa Leo, and Paul Dano, this is a smartly constructed and emotionally resound mystery thriller that is thoroughly enjoyable.The synopsis is fully in the trailer. When two young girls go missing, one belonging to Keller and Grace (Jackman and Bello), the other to Franklin and Nancy (Howard and Davis), a hot-shot detective (Gyllenhaal) is assigned to the case and relentlessly tries to find the clues that could lead to the whereabouts of the missing. When a mentally handicapped Alex Jones (Dano) is found near the scene of the disappearance with no hard evidence, Keller takes matters into his own hands.I have to say that I've never been this hypnotized with the works of Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal. Jackman, who is fresh of his inaugural nomination for Tom Hooper's \"Les Miserables\" has capitalized in a massive way. Approaching his character with the ferocity that made him a star in the \"X-Men\" franchises, he hammers his way into every scene, keeping the audience guessing about their own moral complexities. He tears into scenes in a way we've never seen him and layers his character with plenty of affection, empathy, grief, and rage. It's his best dramatic endeavor he's ever done.When it comes to Jake Gyllenhaal, many, and probably for the right reasons, gravitate towards his work in Ang Lee's \"Brokeback Mountain\" as his shining moment in film history. I believe he's gone deeper in works like \"Jarhead\" and \"Zodiac\" but those were just the surface of what he can do as an actor. As Detective Loki, Gyllenhaal stands firm and tall in one of the year's finest performances. Terrifically executed as a man disconnected from real emotion, he finds himself enamored by the mystery surrounding two missing girls. He also orchestrates character beats and ticks that's reminiscent of Joaquin Phoenix's towering work in \"The Master\" last year.What is very refreshing in the film is it offers a great reminder of how brilliant an actor Terence Howard is. The Oscar-nominated actor seemed to fall by the wayside following his nomination for \"Hustle and Flow\" in 2006, coincidentally the same year Gyllenhaal snagged his first, and now has realized his capabilities when he chooses more dynamic and passionate characters. In a film that centers around his involvement, Paul Dano doesn't have too much to offer but is completely adequate in form.The film however is not entirely perfect. Aaron Guzikowski's depth screenplay offers a great mystery story, full of twists and turns, all the bit a tad predictable, but that's not where he falters so much. His construction of the female counterparts, Maria Bello, Viola Davis, and Melissa Leo, are not as crisply or smoothly put together as I'd like them to be. They each have one \"scene\" that gives us their character's motivation and the look into their cinematic psyche however, some are thrown in quite lazily and manages to halt the story in spots.The film's technical merits all rise to the abilities of its cast. Roger Deakins, the most overdue Cinematographer in the business, captures stunning portraits of conversations, weather, and scenes that continue to prove his brilliance in the film world. The film's score is masterfully placed by J\u00f3hann J\u00f3hannsson while Joel Cox and Gary Roach edit the film to an impeccable pace. At 153 minutes, the film is detailed, precise, and engaging nearly throughout. I feel there's a shorter cut of the film that would surely be a Best Picture nominee for this year's Academy Awards if it existed. The film could still garner that support with what they have now, but I think there are aspects of the film members won't be able to get around. A high level of violence and torture scenes infused with a longer run time could keep people at a distance. One thing that can't be denied is the towering works of Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal. The two have offered plenty of memorable performances in their filmography, but their work in \"Prisoners\" is cut and clear their best they've offered.\"Prisoners\" is a magnificent achievement for the film year. Thorough, enigmatic, and purely amazing. A must-see for the movie lovers.The film opens in theaters this Friday, September 20.",

            "content": "\"Prisoners\" is rich in compelling narratives and stellar performances from the ensemble cast. This movie had me love and hate Hugh Jackman's character which was so complex to the point of making me question my moral standards because I found myself empathizing with his character. On the other hand, Jake Gyllenhaal did a marvelous job on playing the frustrated cop: complete with all the intensity of his eyes and his intuition. While Gyllenhaal had more screentime as the lead, Jackman's performance really stood out for me.This film doesn't use jumpscares (often precluded by suspenseful music to build-up the tension and are often abused in this genre) in order to thrill the audience, but rather, moments of silence and stillness. Its calm and cold vibe stirs up the kind of anxiety it wants its audience to feel, and naturally, the audience would want to get rid of that uneasiness by knowing what's going on, thus, cleverly forcing them to watch the entire film which runs about 2 hrs and 33 mins.The director, Denis Villeneuve, incorporates his \"less is more\" style of using soundtracks in this movie (just like what he did with Blade Runner 2049) to emphasize the scenes, especially with the ending (heavens know how much I liked that ending). It's not rocket suspense but the simplicity of it makes your mind wander to other possibilities which I think is often a good indication of a brilliant film since it's open for other interpetations.However, one thing that won't make me rate this a perfect 9 or 8 is the fact that I'm not entirely convinced on the motivation of the antagonists for doing the things they did. It felt a bit rushed (for the lack of a better word) and while it makes sense, it doesn't leave me satisfied",

The acting was wonderful, emotional and nuanced, with some unforgettable moments (The two leads - Gyllenhaal and Jackman - give their career best performances, but the biggest achievement in my opinion is Paul Dano's). The musical score contributes to a sense of dread, as well as the rich sound design and the chilly color palette of the breathtaking cinematography.All those parts add up to a rare, gut-wrenching, dark and fascinating masterpiece - the kind that lingers with you long after the credits roll.",

            "content": "Prisoners, the new film from Canadian director Denis Villeneuve (Polytechnique), is a top notch nail-biting crime-drama that is as good a theatre as modern Hollywood has the ability to produce. Hugh Jackman and Maria Bello play the parental figures of the Dover family. They are your average hard-working blue-collar family who begin their story by visiting neighbours Franklin and Nancy Birch (Terrence Howard and Viola Davis) for a Thanksgiving dinner. The Franklins and the Dover's each have two children, the youngest of which (Anna and Joy) head out from their home on a November afternoon to play only to mysteriously disappear. Upon a frantic search, the Franklins and the Dover's suspect the worse. Especially when their elder children tell them of a mysterious camper that was parked just down the street. Police soon find the camper with Alex Jones (Paul Dano) behind the wheel. Alex has the mentality of a 10-year-old and tries fleeing when surrounded by authorities. But when Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) begins to interrogate Alex, he is less convinced that Alex was a part of the abduction. As days pass, Loki and Keller Doller work in opposite directions on the investigation. Keller is convinced that Alex Jones was a part of the abduction and kidnaps the frail and challenged Jones and tortures him for days in an attempt to extract answers. Meanwhile, Detective Loki follows leads that open up possibilities of a crime where multiple persons may be involved. And Oscar nominee Melissa Leo appears in a supporting but pivotal role that will assist in the closure.The trailer for Prisoners may have audiences hearkening back to Ron Howard's Ransom, but this is hardly the cookie-cutter kidnapping film that Mel Gibson lead back in 1996. Prisoners instead is an engulfing drama. One with a superb performance by lead Hugh Jackman that challenges how far someone would/should go in an effort to locate their stolen child. The script, from writer Aaron Guzikowski (Contrband) takes audiences down many different paths and emotional rides and Jackman's performance will have you rooting for his quest for answers even though his methods are unorthodox and highly illegal.The film is gritty and full of realistic characters and situations culminating in a perfect ending that goes 9/10ths of the way in giving its audience full closure. Not as much an edge-of-your seat thriller as it is a Zodiac type of crime drama where the stakes are the lives of two small children. Denis Villeneuve's last effort, Incendies, was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Film in 2011. Prisoners shows that he can move solidly into big star larger scaled films with the ease of a well worn slipper. And Prisoners catapults Villeneuve into not just a director to watch, but a director whose work should be awaited with palpable excitement.www.killerreviews.com",

            "review_title": "A True (and terrific) Exploration of Moral Ambiguity",
            "content": "Wow, what an intensely suspenseful film Prisoners was. The film commences with a naturalistic and peaceful look of a suburban neighborhood, leafless trees calmly swaying along with the cool air that encompass them. All is fine, and a perfectly normal family visits their friends/neighbors for a delightful dinner and some music. Everything is fine and dandy until both family's two kids run off to retrieve a toy they left outside. After pleasant conversation, the two families begin to realize that their kids haven't gotten back yet. The noiseless environment around them feels incredibly unusual, and once they realize that their kids have officially gone missing, chaos breaks loose. We are suddenly presented with a ruthless father (played by Hugh Jackman) who loves his daughter so much that he's willing to transcend any morally difficult obstacles to hopefully locate her. A spectacular cast, ranging from the likes of Hugh Jackman to Jake Gyllenhaal to Viola Davis and Terrence Howard, create such a chilling atmosphere that everyone in the audience immediately notices the discomforting subject matter as they prepare for a disturbing viewing. One should know prior to visiting the movie theater that this film doesn't feature morally perfect individuals. They are all human beings cast into an unbelievably frightening situation, and this is where larges amounts of debate will stir. There's one side of the audience that will persistently detest the characters' actions and the characters themselves, and there's the other side (which I am proudly a part of) that will essentially understand that people can't possibly (always) be the \"goody-two-shoes\" heroes, perceived in Hollywood blockbusters, in reality- that, by god, I will partake morally and ethically questionable activities to save a precious, loved one, absolutely! Such conversation/argument is healthy for it proves the memorability factor of the film itself. After you witness the terrifically-crafted picture, you will find enjoyment in discussing the movie's events with friends and family with- eventually- two sides forming over the talk. And holy crap is Hugh Jackman entirely convincing in his performance. You can see the longing to find his sweet, innocent daughter through his miserable eyes, filled with redness, desperation, and anger. Then, there's Jake Gyllenhaal as the second lead, playing an ambitious cop who holds a very impressive resume: no unsolved cases left under his plate. Can that mean his skill will greatly help in this predicament? On a similar note, Paul Dano takes the prize after Hugh Jackman for another wonderful performance. No offense or anything, but he completely fits into these immensely creepy and eerie roles. Speaking of, the soundtrack will definitely remain in that shocked mind of yours long after you've left the theater because it fills us with a sense of hopelessness and discomfort. At times, it sounds exceptionally ominous with the disconcerting sound of those violins in play. At others, it sounds like the music weeps for all those involved. The pace never seems to drag even though it clocks in at around 150 minutes as you remain at the edge of seat the entire time, utterly perplexed by everything that's transpiring and wholly befuddled by the choices that these people are making. The film will make you cringe and question the humanity of the participants or the competence of our law (that word could mean two things). Although I was slightly disappointed with the end result, the majority of the film strongly intrigued me. And, oh, how could I forget, the cinematography is simply amazing. Roger Deakins, the brilliant cinematographer behind last year's Skyfall, manages the camera-work of this film as well. As one wise critic said, a drive in the rain never felt so disquieting- a moment of foreboding. Furthermore, I would not recommend skipping out on Prisoners unless you're of the type that prefers more lighthearted and fun movies like The Avengers. If you love films that explore more than just entertainment and \"fun,\" such as important themes and moral ambiguity as a whole, you cannot go wrong with Prisoners. With a mix of top-notch cinematography, remarkably unsettling music, superb performances, and a thrilling/powerful story, Prisoners will definitely be one of this year's features that I'll surely be remembering. The true cinema season has started; now, let's hope every film from here on out delivers like this one did.",

            "content": "That 'Prisoners' is directed by Denis Villeneuve, has cinematography by Roger Deakins and a music score from Johann Johannsson promised a big deal, having seen 'Sicario' and being blown away by its brilliance, especially in these areas. As did having a cast of talented actors such as Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Paul Dano, Viola Davis and Melissa Leo.'Prisoners' almost lives up to the acclaimed hype with most of the film being absolutely exceptional, but doesn't quite make it. Its only major stumbling block is that it spirals out of control towards the end, the tension does slip, there are big lapses in credibility and characters' actions and morality issues become implausible and much less believable. Having been so impressed with the rest of the film, this was a real pity. Maybe it is a little overlong too.On the other hand, Roger Deakins shows again why he is one of the best contemporary cinematographers in the business with cinematography that's stunning and darkly gritty, also bringing out the visceral horror. The production values in general are impeccably audacious and deeply haunting and the editing is suitably stylish.Johannsson's music score is suitably ominous and pulse-pulsating, one can actually feel their heart beat with tension and anticipation.Villeneuve's directing has a beautiful darkness but also a hard edge that is perfect for the story.While the script is not quite as taut as that for 'Sicario', it does provoke thought and its unsettled nature hits hard. The story is not perfect, but a vast majority of it is nail-biting in tension, frightening in its suspense and very much edge of your seat. It is very violent and is not for the faint hearted because it is so vivid and the turn of events are unpredictable and devastating. It's deliberate in pacing but never dull, despite slacking towards the end.Characters are interesting, especially Jackman's increasingly unpredictable Keller Dover. You don't condone what he's done and his actions are extreme and one can sort of understand why he resorts to such drastic measures.Jackman is at his most hard-hitting, a shocking atypical performance that is among his best. Gyllenhaal is firm and understated, Dano is at his most unnerving and at times affecting and Terrence Howard gives one of the best performances he's ever given (showing that with the right material, like here, that he can be good).Davis and Leo, as to be expected, are outstanding, as is a poignant Maria Bello.In summary, 'Prisoners' may be long in length yet high in suspense and tension. It had all the makings of an exceptional film, and actually was for most of its running time, but that the ending disappoints as much it does it goes down to being a very good one. 8/10 Bethany Cox",

Canadian director Denis Villeneuve, whose last film was the equally spellbinding and disturbing Incendies, builds up the tension from the first frame and does not let up for the full 153 minutes of the movie. Aaron Guzikowski's script, though on the surface a child kidnapping thriller, bucks all Hollywood trends and, as well as being a taut thriller, poses serious moral issues. It also helps that the film has a first rate cast doing outstanding work: Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Paul Dano, Terence Howard, Melissa Leo, Maria Bello and Viola Davis. Prisoners is not for the faint heated but is likely to feature strongly at next year's Oscars.",

I watched it when I was 13 with a friend of mine after his step-dad recommended it. It freaked the hell out of me and left me with nightmares for weeks, simply due to the performances of Paul Dano, as the quiet and shy man-child and David Dastmalchian, as the creepy and slightly eerie red herring.Hugh Jackman played an excellent part showing the quick change from sane to distressed in few scenes after his child was kidnapped, and Jake Gyllenhaal perfected his role as a determined but stressed detective; it's a shame he wasn't Oscar nominated.I was hooked from minute one and was on the edge of my seat for the remainder of the film in order to find out the perpetrator.This film is very thoroughly thought through and is not too obvious nor too vague and will keep you watching.I only gave it an 8 rating rather than a 9 or 10 due to some minor plot holes - firstly, what was the 'maze' all about? And why was David Dastmalchian's character there, other than for distracting the viewer from the actual criminal?",

            "content": "Even if he already worked for over 20 years before that, director Denis Villeneuve rose to fame considerably after giving audiences his 2010 film \"Incendies\", a nominee for the Best Foreign Language Oscar. With \"prisoners\" he directed his very first English-language movie. Two young girls disappear and the film centers on the father (Jackman) of one of them and the cop (Gyllenhaal) investigating what might have happened to them. Jackman, who already gave one of my favorite performances last year with his impressive turn as Jean Valjean, delivers again as a father who does what needs to be done to save his daughter's life and Gyllenhaal, who I've never been that big of a fan, impressed me as well. His portrayal of a loner, in his profession as well as his private life, gave me the chills occasionally and proves that he can pull off characters that go far beyond the pretty boy / nice guy image.Mostly thanks to its two leads and very atmospheric images and music, this film turned out a success and kept me on the edge of the seat for almost all of its very long 2.5 hours. It gets slightly worse when the secret behind the disappearances gets uncovered, just because most of the quiet tension vanishes and more action ensues, but it's still pretty decent. The invisible danger is far more effective than the danger from Melissa Leo when she gets exposed as the grandma from hell. She and the whole supporting cast do a decent job overall and Dano (especially), Leo, Davis and Howard did a fine job with what they were given and all have at least one scene where they can shine and command the screen. The only one who kinda left me unimpressed was Maria Bello. Once again. Guess I'm just not a great fan of her. Besides that, there were certain flaws here and there, such as the whole maze reference or the introduction of the husband to Leo's character, but looking at the whole picture, those were really just minor factors that can't remotely hurt the overall perception. This film is definitely worth a watch. Recommended, especially if you liked Eastwood's \"Mystic River\" and the ending scene is equally brilliant here.",

            "content": "There is a scene in \"On Dangerous Ground\" (1951) in which half-crazy detective Robert Ryan is about to beat the living crap out of a suspect to gain information. Ryan's features twist into a pustule of hate, hardly human. \"Why do you DO it? Why do you punks make me DO it?\" And then he goes frantically to work.This is a a more complex story of the kidnapping of two little girls and the lengths to which the parents and police are willing to go to either retrieve the victims or find the bodies. But the most complicated character, the father who engages our interest because he instrumentalizes his grief and anger (Jackman), does more or less what Ryan does in the earlier film. He goes berserk, tramples on the law, and reduces a half-wit that he suspects to a bloody pulp.There are harmonies in the sometimes torpid story that I didn't quite get or wasn't sure of. There are ominous organ chords, a drunken priest who is a red herring, and references to penance. There's a candle light vigil for the girls. It's deep enough, even without any spiritual content. After all, when you get right down to it, the question raised by Jackman's tactics is: \"How far is it ethical to go in torturing a prisoner, even in a good cause?\" It's a medieval issue but recently a more contemporary one.It's a long movie -- too long, really -- and it could have benefited from more ruthless cutting, yet it all adds up. The director, Villeneuve, effectively captures the drab aspects of working-class life in one of those flat, brick, ranch-type residential neighborhoods on the outskirts of a small town in Pennsylvania, actually shot in Georgia.The acting is, well, hard to describe in a word but maybe \"naturalistic\" will do. It's something like \"All The President's Men\" in that respect. The kidding around and the hesitations and interruptions don't sound as if they were being read from cue cards.Jackman is fine as the enraged father who is determined to beat a confession out of his retarded prisoner, but he's not a sadist. He doesn't ENJOY doing it. And the scenes are truncated, avoiding the nasty current affection for torture porn that has infected movies like \"Unthinkable\" or the unbearable \"The Killing Gene.\" The viewer is likely to be \"for\" or \"against\" the other characters but Jackman's is problematic. He's not just rude or irrational. He's brutal. It's what makes it the most interesting role.In fact, everyone pulls his or her weight, but Maria Bello is truly impressive, though she doesn't have that much screen time. And Mellisa Leo as the mother of the chief suspect is outstanding. One of those distant, suspicious, kindly authoritative, slightly sour Midwesterners, though she's from New York.The ending collapses in upon itself. People do idiotic things like search dangerous places without calling for back up. Without warning, a familiar character splits open and reveals the demon within. Clich\u00e9 follows clich\u00e9. I still don't exactly understand it. The rest is tense, involving, quite well done.",

While Detective Loki investigates the pedophiles near the location, Keller decides to abduct Alex to torture him and find where his beloved daughter and her friend are, crossing the thin line between right and wrong.\"Prisoners\" is a mesmerizing, ambiguous and gritty thriller about the kidnapping of two girls by a sick serial-killer. The plot is divided in interesting premises that raise the discussion of what is right and what is wrong when the life of your daughter is in danger. Is Keller right or wrong abducting Alex after listening to what he told him? The police work is flawed, leaving Alex without surveillance just like in the real world.This movie has magnificent cast and cinematography and the story has glimpses of the dark Franc-Dutch \"Spoorloos\" (1988).

            "content": "In the space of a few days both the male stars of this film were so heavily into promoting it that they both appeared on the Daily Show on different nights. This suggested that the film must be struggling either because of quality or because it is a hard sell \u2013 and it certainly seemed that the latter was most likely to be the reason for the sales push. The plot sees two young girls go missing on thanksgiving in a small rural town; a suspect is found and while the police try to figure it all out, the emotional impact on the two families starts to take its toll.This is a hard sell, even before we get to the meat of the story everything has a downbeat tone \u2013 even Thanksgiving seems a subdued affair with the grey skies and rain. From here it gets darker as the children go missing, the investigation starts and morality is testing in the actions of the characters. On this level it mostly works pretty well \u2013 mostly. The realistic tone to everything draws you into the story and it keeps you there as things start to get murky both in terms of the investigation but also the actions of the characters. This offered a much more interesting film than just a straight police procedural and for a lot of the time it does have real impact to it, but gradually it shies away from it \u2013 having its cake and eating it at the same time. This leaves the mystery which is also not as satisfyingly as I would have liked; it was solid enough but with the cast and the dark, adult tone to the film, I was hoping that the narrative would be brave enough to match it in many ways. It did a decent job, but it really did feel like it walked it back too much in too many ways. In terms of length it does run long and would have been better if the mystery hadn't included so many different branches within it.The cast justify the tone and everyone is excellent \u2013 to the point where I wished the material hadn't seemed to lose it in the final third. Whether this is a shot at Oscars I don't know but everyone is as strong as the castlist would suggest. Gyllenhaal has a straightforward character but makes a good presence from it; he has an intensity and presence that works for him and the film. Jackman does a great job with a changeable character \u2013 bravely ploughing into his actions with determination and as a result it is a shame for his performance that the film doesn't hold together as well as it should for the final third. Support is generally very strong as you would expect from Bello, Howard, Davis, Leo, Dano and others.Overall Prisoners is an engagingly dark and murky crime thriller. The mystery is flawed but still good, while the morality questions are well presented if not fully followed through. A shame for the strong performances that the film doesn't totally hold it together and deliver, but it is still worth watching for what it does well.",

            "content": "After viewing \"Prisoners\" opening night in the theater, I turned to my companions during the closing credits and said \"I feel like I've just been through a ten round prize fight\". It had been a long time since I'd seen a movie that battered my emotions quite as much as this one. Seven years later, upon a recent re-watch, my emotions are about the same. This is about as viscerally intense of a film as one will ever watch.For a very basic overview, \"Prisoners\" opens on a typical Thanksgiving day in what just might be your (the viewers') neighborhood. Instead of the normal revelry and family cheer, however, the daughters of Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) and Franklin Birch (Terrence Howard) are kidnapped. When detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) finds a very strange suspect (Paul Dano), it jump-starts the case in a terrifying direction that goes further into the realm of gritty reality than most films will show.I consider \"Prisoners\" to be one of the best films I've ever seen (I don't even want to put a genre to it, as that would be such a disservice to its breadth) because it is so perfect on both the plot and character levels.Plot-wise, it is a simple kidnapping story (one that has been utilized numerous times in cinema), yet director Dennis Villeneuve pushes its boundaries to the very max. Just when you think you have the film pinned down, it manages to surprise you and go in another direction. Yet, everything makes logical sense and feels \"real\" at the same time.That being said, the kidnapping plot itself (while brilliant) is not even the primary focus of the film. Instead, it is the characters reactions to the events, making viewers ponder how we would react in similar situations. The main focus here is on Dover and Loki, but each character adds a very specifically nuanced emotion to the overall mix. The result is drama the likes of which is rarely seen (and sustained for nearly two and a half hours) on the big screen.Themes-wise, comparisons can be drawn to the ethics of torture (especially prevalent in a post-Iraq War world) and almost a Dirty Harry-esque turn of one man taking justice into his own hands when \"the system\" seems to be failing him.Overall, \"Prisoners\" is a film that will stay with you long after each viewing. It's characters are so perfect and its themes so precise in their exploration that it's almost a little spooky how genuinely it can connect with reality. In terms of films that portray a stark, as-close-to-reality scenario as possible, this has to be at or near the top of that list.",

Prisoners is a film about two families who both of their daughters get kidnapped and both of the families with the help of the police, investigate and look for their daughters. This is a very dark, grim, and at times is a hard film to sit through. That being said, I have created a PainOmeter scale out of five (five being the worst) to inform you guys if you simply cannot take very violent and painful scenes. This will be addressed along will the film's final score. I loved this film! Hugh Jackman plays Anna's father and is the protagonist of the film. You can see how Jackman really loses his rag and does a great job as Keller Dover. There is one scene that involves Jackman doing something that I won't spoil but you will notice it and go WOW! The story is also very thought provoking and will keep you on the edge of your seat because of the direction and character building involved with this movie. Also Paul Dano who plays Alex Jones, is this weird adult with the IQ of a ten year old and is the main suspect of the investigation. I thought he nailed just the right tone of the character and was hard to \"look at\" at times. My favorite part of the film was surprisingly Jake Gyllenhaal's performance as the detective looking for the missing girls. Gyllenhaal still plays the role of a cop very well after all of that training for End Of Watch. Another great part of the film is that it manages to never take a rest on character building and story development. I hate when films give you time to take a break then start all over again and this film really avoids that entirely. I really have no problems with the film except for the runtime. Even though this was a great movie I just couldn't go for a perfect grade of an A+. I will give Prisoners an A solid.",

This film captures all these moments in such a realistic manner which is what makes the film all the more interesting.The screenplay by Aaron Guzikowski is truly brilliant.

In no way did I feel their characters were unconvincing. They kept it fully grounded to match the tone of the film. Everyone else also played their roles perfectly.

            "content": "I had no expectations of this movie, as I was dragged along to see it by a mate with a Jake Gyllenhaal fixation, but was pleasantly surprised to find it was a bleak-seeming action/drama with Hugh Jackman too, who's generally excellent in everything he's in. The first 30 minutes or so of the movie were really promising. I liked the set-up of the 2 cozy families in their suburban idyll sharing a thanksgiving meal and discovering, to their horror, their kids had somehow gone missing. That part felt very real, very \"based on a true story\" and had me on the edge of my seat. As the film went on though, the clunky writing and flabby storytelling started to lose my interest.#1. My first big problem came with the utterly implausible discovery of the body in the pedophile priest's basement. First of all, Gyllenhaal's decision to move the freezer based on the flex being dangerously stretched, just seemed...dumb. Why would he care if the guy stretches his flex? It didn't seem from his reaction (\"drunks!\") that he thought the freezer was hiding something, and yet he opts to shove the big heavy thing closer to the socket because presumably it bothers him. Then - whoa - there's a door there, and whoa it's a big cellar (which is not that weird really), and now - whoa - look a body!#2. And next came a great big WHY? He's a pedophile catholic priest so why was he SO outraged that a man might kill kids. He abuses children but is still so horrified by a killer that he opts to kill the guy who's (again...utterly improbably) has come to him for confession, but not so horrified that he tells ANYONE the guy's story? Or attempts to find out if it's true before he offs him? Instead he just stuffs the body in the basement and drinks a lot. Hmm.#3. My next problem was the biggest and clumsiest of the plot points. Gyllenhaal finds a body and hears a weird-ass tale about child murders (and presumably there's a not a lot of those locally), but despite his incredible intellect and ability to make connections, he doesn't spot the REALLY ODD MAZE NECKLACE on the body until the drawing falls conveniently from his desk alongside it, and make the connection between the two. #4. Why is escaped and presumably traumatized kidnap victim Bob stealing children's clothes, covering them in pig's blood and putting them in boxes full of snakes? It would make sense if he was somehow part of the cover-up, or working for Alex's aunt, but he's not. So for some reason known only to himself he's stealing clothes and making it seem like Anna and Joy are dead when they're not. Presumably because he's traumatized. Or just mental. But either way, it's not really explained, it's just a great big red herring that confuses everything.#5. What is the significance of Keller's dad's suicide? Because if there is no significance, why show Loki reading about it as if it's important? Presumably (again) it's so he can find out that the building that Keller's going to is where his dad died - but so what? Why is it important, other than to cloud the waters and confuse the audience even more. Was Keller connected to his father's suicide, why was no note found...all questions we have no need to ask.#6. WTF is this all maze rubbish? Right from the poster we're led to expect some kind of maze to appear. The serial killer wears a necklace with a maze on it, Alex says \"they're in the maze\", Bob is obsessed with drawing mazes, so where's the freaking maze man? When Holly gets Keller to back the car up we think \"FINALLY! HERE'S THE MAZE!!! But there's no maze down there, just a big deep hole full of old sneakers and dead snakes. No maze, not even a sniff of one. The only maze-related thing as it turns out, is a puzzle book that Leo forces the kids to do while they're kidnapped, presumably traumatizing them with their inability to solve simple puzzles. It might just as well have been Sudoku really, but that might have looked weird on a necklace...#7. And finally, the pointless sub-plot. Just WHAT is the purpose and meaning behind Keller's kidnap and torture of Alex? It has no real purpose other than to provide a weirdly amoral counterpoint to the other story (which would have been so much better emphasized if we'd seen anything of the girls' captivity), and leaves us confused and kind of weirdly angry with the guy. Alex is an innocent child and Keller has tortured him almost to death, so what does that make him? A villain? An anti-hero? A misguided vigilante? No-one seems to care if we know, so we end up drawing no conclusion at all and Keller ends up as a shapeless figure that we ultimately care little about.Ultimately my feeling was that this could have been a good film, if only someone with experience and a keen eye had been brought in to work on the script and iron out the many flaws. The cinematography and the score was great, and it's a testament to the director and actors that the movie was still highly watchable despite the glaring plot holes and confusing storytelling, but on the whole it was a disappointing and frustrating experience and not one I'd recommend.",

            "content": "Prisoners (2013)A highly rated movie at the moment, but be sure to know this is very well- worked territory, and it's a well made but conventionally made movie. There are some plot surprises but they won't be new ones. There is a detective (well played by Jake Gyllenhaal) but he's a familiar type. There is the parent (four parents, but one in particular, played by Hugh Jackman) who does some terrible things trying to find his daughter-but even this is now old territory (even Mel Gibson took that on).You won't have to suffer the mistreatment of little kids here, which is something some directors would explore and abuse. This is a story about the urgent hunting of the kidnappers before time ran out. There is no real clock to heighten our anxiety, just the feeling that the longer it goes on the more likely the children aren't going to make it. Mostly we follow the detective around as he follows leads and instincts, and the one dad who has his own idea of who's to blame.There is no good rationale for the kidnappings, either. Not money, which would have been easy, but some kind of religious freak craziness is to blame. An obsession with mazes creeps in, but even this we don't quite get. No, the specifics are endlessly avoided. Instead we are dependent on personality, and to some extent that works pretty well. It doesn't make for a whole movie, however.Director Denis Villeneuve has an interesting resume, including the hard-hitting \"Incendies\" which has (unlike this movie) a clear and sensational plot line. I'm not sure what made his drag this movie to an hour and a half-some economy might have been the main thing it needed, though the lack of explanation almost makes it seem a half hour has been excised already.Lots of people will not agree with me (apparently) but as a \"useful\" review I'm really trying to lay out the basic qualities that you can then judge for yourself. Bottom line? It's not boring even if it seems long, and it's a kind of film I like so I enjoyed it in a mild kind of way. That's a start!",

            "content": "Watching the disturbing Hugh Jackman child abduction thriller \"Prisoners\" is like rubbernecking at the scene of a car accident. Initially, your curiosity gets the best of you and gawk. Of course, the sight of the blood and gore sickens you. Nevertheless, you can't take your eyes off it because it makes you consider your own mortality. \"Prisoners\" keeps the blood and gore to a minimum, but the nature of the crimes leaves a bad taste in your mouth. Oscar-nominated French-Canadian director Denis Villeneuve and \"Contraband\" scenarist Aaron Guzikowski have created a compelling criminal melodrama that shuns the usual Hollywood glitz and glamor. Indeed, the filmmakers accentuate realism at every turn. The squeamish might reconsider seeing this tragic tale. The unwholesome subject of child abduction qualifies as heavyweight material, and \"Prisoners\" never resorts to humor to lighten the atmosphere. Actually, the dreadful events in this narrative may challenge your ability to enjoy this intense psychological character study. Clocking in at 153 minutes, \"Prisoners\" is relentless both in its length and depth. I can't say enough good things about this inspired but unsavory crime drama. The characters stand out boldly from the background. Each emerges with greater depth and irony than Hollywood allows, and Villeneuve generates considerable, white-knuckled suspense. Sometimes, the quietest moments prove to be the most suspenseful. Comparably, \"Prisoners\" resembles an episode of the CBS-TV crime series \"Criminal Minds,\" but clean-scrubbed, well-dressed, FBI agents aren't investigating the crime. The local authorities handle the case and display appalling incompetence. A father turns into a vigilante and passes the point of no return to save his daughter. Nobody in this grim, lurid yarn is without a flaw. You won't want to be like them because they lose their cool. \"Prisoners\" is about a lot of good people doing all the wrong things. When a small-time carpenter, Dover Keller (Hugh Jackman of \"The Wolverine\"), isn't in the woods hunting with his son, he dotes on his adorable, six-year old daughter. Anna Dover (Erin Gerasimovich) and her African-American girlfriend, Joy Birch (Kyla Drew Simmons), are playing in their quiet, suburban neighborhood when they notice a recreational vehicle parked on the street. Dover and his best friend Franklin Birch (Terrence Howard of \"Iron Man\") and their wives and older children are enjoying a peaceful Thanksgiving dinner when the girls turn up missing. Earlier, Dover had told his son Ralph (Dylan Minnette) and Birch's daughter Eliza (Zoe Borde) to keep tabs on the youngsters. They search the neighborhood but find no traces of either Anna or Joy. Eventually, a police organize a widespread man hunt, with Dover and his son trudging through the woods with an army of other people. Dover's wife Grace (Maria Bello of \"Payback\") has retreated to her bed with pills galore while her husband counts the hours. Meantime, the police spot the suspicious vehicle near a convenience store, and Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal of \"End of Watch\") arrives and approaches it with his gun drawn. The driver, Alex Jones (Paul Dano of \"Cowboys & Aliens\"), behaves hysterically at the sight of all the flashing blue lights. Jones tries to drive off the premises. Instead, he careens into the woods and smashes up the vehicle. Loki arrests Alex, but Loki's police chief superior releases him later because they found no incriminating evidence either on him or in the RV. Enraged at Alex's early release, Dover confronts him in the parking lot, and the police have to restrain Dover. Later, Dover abducts Alex and tortures him. He demands that Alex reveal the whereabouts of his daughter and her companion. Alex repeatedly tells him that he knows nothing about Anna and Joy. Grimly, Dover devises other ways to torture Alex. Meantime, Detective Loki is on the trail of a bizarre individual who buys children's apparel despite the fact that he has no children. Moreover, he stores the apparel in locked plastic tubs writhing with snakes. As you can see, nothing about \"Prisoners\" is lightweight. The scene near the end when Loki careens desperately through traffic to reach the hospital will have you poised on the edge of your seat. One major surprise occurs about three-fourths of the way through \"Prisoners\" when the identity of the villain who is behind a child abduction ring is divulged. By this time, Franklin and Nancy Birch have visited the sight of Dover's torture chamber and allow him to continue with this disgraceful business. Hugh Jackman delivers a shattering performance as a father prepared to torture another human if it will prolong his daughter's life. You've never Jackman play a deranged character like Dover Keller. Keller believes devoutly that his actions are appropriate. Moreover, Keller's closest friends don't flinch at his merciless interrogation techniques. In essentially supporting roles, Maria Bello, Viola Davis, Terence Howard, Paul Dano, and Melissa Leo all distinguish themselves. As the grieving parents, Bello, Davis, and Howard are far more sympathetic than Jackman's distraught father. Paul Dano allows his behavior and bizarre appearance do most of his acting for him. Altogether, Dano emerges as one creepy worm of a guy. Ultimately, Jake Gyllenhaal gives the best performance of his career as a detective who struggles to find clues in the disappearance of two little girls from their neighborhood. Suffice to say, although it qualifies as a superior thriller, \"Prisoners\" will rattle your cage.",

Basically deeply religious Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman), who runs a struggling carpentry business, and his wife Grace (Coyote Ugly's Maria Bello) and their children attend Thanksgiving dinner with their neighbours the Birches, husband Franklin (Terrence Howard) and wife Nancy (Viola Davis) and their children. After this dinner both families' young daughters, Anna Dover (Erin Gerasimovich) and Joy Birch (Kyla Drew Simmons), go missing, the police are called to search, an RV was reported parked in the neighbourhood, and it is found, the driver Alex Jones (Paul Dano) is interrogated by Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal), but there is no clear evidence he did anything, and he has the intelligence of a ten year old. Keller is angry that Alex was released, as he sure he knows the whereabouts of the girls, he abducts him and imprisons him in a partially dilapidated house he owns, and with the reluctant help of Franklin he brutally beats and interrogates him repeatedly without getting anywhere. Feeling really guilty Franklin tells his wife Nancy what is going on, she comes to the house to see Alex and how severely battered he is, the Birches decide not to interfere or help and to allow Keller to continue torturing him, having suffered for a few days he does speak out, mentioning a maze, with this information Keller visits Alex's aunt Holly Jones (The Fighter's Melissa Leo) to see her reaction at mentioning mazes. Bob Taylor (David Dastmalchian) is named a suspect, and at his home the walls are covered with intricate maze drawings, and in a back room locked crates filled with maze books, snakes and blood covered clothing are covered, he is taken into custody, but he manages to commit suicide grabbing a gun, he was not involved with the crime, the blood on the clothes is pig's blood, and the clothing was stolen after the abduction. Joy Birch is found drugged and taken to hospital days later, Anna is still missing, rambling the found girl says in her prison she heard Keller's voice, Loki follows Keller, finding the abandoned house and Alex imprisoned, Keller meanwhile goes back to Holly's house realising Joy heard his voice there, she holds him at gunpoint and drugs him, revealing she was the one who abducted the girls. Holly explains that she had abducted many others before, including Bob Taylor, \"waging a war on God\" making parents lose their religion as revenge for the death of her child from cancer, the first child abducted was Alex, she then shoots Keller in the leg and puts him in a pit outside hidden under a car, this was where the girls was imprisoned. Loki turns up at the house to tell Holly that Alex has been found, and he catches her about to kill Anna, trying to make her raise her hands she shoots him, he shoots and kills Holly, Anna is rushed to hospital, her mother thanks the detective, the little girl mentions her red whistle that she lost whilst abducted, and back at the Jones house Loki hears the faint sound of a whistle as the film ends. Also starring Dylan Minnette as Ralph Dover, Zoe Borde as Eliza Birch, Wayne Duvall as Captain Richard O'Malley, Len Cariou as Father Patrick Dunn and Brad James as Officer Carter. Jackman gives a great provocative performance as the father will do anything to get his daughter back, Gyllenhaal is also exceptional as the police officer trying to help him unaware of the disturbing events unfolding, supporting stars Howard and Davis are good support as well. The story works as both a kidnap mystery and a desperate search for the evidence and truth behind the crime, you may need a strong stomach to watch all the violence and torture that unfolds, it also makes you question how far you would go in a situation as portrayed in this, a controversial but satisfyingly engaging crime drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Cinematography. Very good!",

How pleasant to find that Prisoners has more to offer than a simple who is the criminal? And just how far will a vengeful father go to satiate his grief?.Prisoners is such an apt title because all the main players here are trapped by either mental fragility or victims of their innocence, guilt or chaotic impulses. It's a multi stranded character piece that poses many questions, while of course it has a big mystery element. The narrative features a whole host of clues that might be something, or not, unanswered questions dangle throughout until the finale reveals thge edgy secrets.It's safe to say that the themes at work here are dark and upsetting, with the core abduction thread siddling up against horredous back stories, torture and religious mania. Gruzikowski's screenplay is quality, mesmerising even, there's no lazy filler or extranous sequences, even as the jigsaw pieces are put together in the last quarter, you may find yourself wondering how you missed something so simple?.This was Villeneuve's first English language picture, and it's not hard to see why he was highly touted as one of the next big director beings - his output that followed subsequently bears this out. His control of mood and pacing is superb, his garnering of high quality perfs from his cast (notably Jackman and Gyllenhaal) is impressive, and his teaming with the great Deakins is a match made in photographic heaven.This is adult film making, a thriller designed to illicit emotional responses from the audience. Relentless and powerful, a troubling examination of the human conditioning in various guises - and we are witnesses. 9/10",

            "content": "Prisoners is the latest in a long line of critically revered movies- the type of film that gets revered to death by critics and makes it into a number of \"best of the year\" lists that has me wondering if I somehow got conned into seeing a fraudulent copy of the movie, or if the critics have either temporarily or permanently lost their minds. No doubt a lot of films have left me with that feeling this year (Gravity being another example), but Prisoners may be the worst example. And there's also no doubt in my mind that this film is widely loved by those film school students who only seem to love \"film\" and not mainstream movies, probably out of sheer fear that they'll probably enjoy one. And what makes it so bizarre that I'm saying this is that Prisoners isn't a bad movie at all. Sure, bizarre, pretentious and way in over its head at times? Maybe. But for the first half at least, the audience can assure themselves that they're about to watch a quality suspense-drama about what a parent does when their kid inexplicably goes missing.No doubt, the first half of this film is incredibly solid and for a while, I was positive that I was wrong about any misgivings I had. It's well filmed, even. Then again, anything shot by Roger Deakins will look really pretty. The film's slow and meditative pace was also a big factor in keeping the film grounded, because it almost made it feel as if everything was happening in real time. When the parents find out their kids have gone missing, their desperation feels incredibly real. Hell, I didn't mind when they brought in Paul Dano in as a suspect as soon as they did, because it did make for some interesting brain work. In particular, the scene where Hugh Jackman encounters him in the parking lot and Dano distinctly whispers, \"They only cried when I left them...\" was brilliantly executed. However, it's when a second suspect named Bob (yeah, it's not like I haven't seen films about kids gone missing where the kidnapper/pedophile is named Bob... get real) is brought in, where the film takes a turn for the worst. This is where the film degenerates into a mess of subplots that go nowhere, over-wrought symbolism and a conclusion that is utterly ridiculous and insulting. There are some problems early on in the film and moments where the film comes off as weak, but at least it has the performances and cinematography to fall back on. But it's here where the problems become obvious.Alright, let's ignore all the plot holes, big or small, but no matter how big or small the holes hare, it's hard to deny the second half of the movie is full of them. Let's ignore the fact that the film pretty much only happens because of a ridiculous amount of coincidences (so this kid was molested but so was this kid and this one other guy is a suspect because he was molested by this priest guy who trapped this guy for molesting kids who may or may not have been trying to turn kids into molesters and so forth...). Let's ignore the fact that there's enough red herrings in the film to make Dan Brown wince.The second half of the film pretty much is aggressively poorly written and goes out of its way to be as stupid as it possibly can, while trying to pass off as smart- which, if the reviews here are any indication, seems to have worked for the most part. Detective Loki, played by Jake Gyllenhaal, is set up to be this oh-so-perfect and excellent detective who apparently is infallible and has never left a case unsolved. Perhaps they named him Detective Loki because Marty Stu was too revealing. And strangely, we never get any evidence of this and we often see him making dumb decisions (like going twice into people's houses unattended, opening suspicious looking tote boxes that could be filled with something harmful- venomous snakes in this case). The aforementioned paedophile corpse found in the paedophile priest's basement has a bit where he discovers a maze necklace on said corpse (it's never explained why the priest tortured the kid rapist and murderer because HE HIMSELF IS A PAEDOPHILE) and passes it off as just something he wears, but then it takes a drawing just conveniently falling off his desk to make the connection? Oh, and what is it with this film's obsession with mazes? Bob draws them a lot and there's a bunch crudely etched on his wall, and Dano's character keeps repeating something like \"There's a maze...\" over and over. Then there's the scene during the ultra- lame twist where Melissa Leo, who apparently kidnapped the kids, forces Jackman to hide in a hole covered by a car... great! This must be the maze! But nope, it's just some hole. Oh, and what is this connection between Leo and Dano, and this Bob guy??? He buys kids clothes and splatters them with pigs blood and hides venomous snakes in his home as a ploy to trick the detectives and the families, but their connection is never revealed.Perhaps why this is such a killer is because there's evidence that there's a great movie bursting to get out of here in this 152-minute mess. There's great acting by Hugh Jackman and Terrence Howard, there's some every pretty cinematography, Villenueve's direction is as tight as ever. I had high hopes for this film, especially being from Canada, where the director is from, however I doubt that it'll be as much of a hit with the audiences as Incendies was, because the film simply thinks it's being clever. But it isn't. And it's about as obvious as a light show at a Muse concert, to make matters worse.",

Plenty of points-of-views of methods and which suspect is guilty abound and it got me hooked for most of the narrative.

There's macabre fun if you don't demand all the holes be filled. Relax and see a good if not great crime story.Revenge in thrillers, from Death Wish to Zero Dark Thirty, ignites American audiences, perhaps from the uncertainty that they can handle all the bad guys around the world. Whatever, Prisoners gives nothing new except sterling performances from Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal (both should have Oscar nominations) and noirish cinematography from the grandmaster, Roger Deakins.Conyers, Pennsylvania's, Keller Dover and Franklin Birch (Terrence Howard) search for their abducted daughters, while police detective Loki (Gyllenhaal) does the footwork necessary to find them while the fathers vilify him for going too slowly. In that tension rests the film's best thematic gravity: How far will you go to find the abductor of your child? Writer Aaron Guzikowski's literary ambitions about theme are on the side of heavy handed (the symbology of the opening hunting scene and Loki's constantly blinking eyes\u2014not seeing clearly, anyone?\u2014 are overripe).However, the dialogue is crisp and the scene shifts are expertly timed to keep us from asking too many logistical questions.The plot twists are not as bad as some might think, and the moral ambiguity where the ends justify the means is as much about the limitations of the judicial system as it is about unadorned vengeance: The audience is torn as they consider the morality of the fathers' actions.

Even if he might be the suspect we are subjected to the overzealous rage filled attacks carried out by the kidnapped child's father. Let's also throw in some religious rhetoric to situate villainy in Christians , elderly widows, depraved sickos and handicapped people.Why were all of these vile charges crammed in just one movie? It leaves me to respond with affirmation that this movie intended to anger, upset and disgust any unsuspecting movie goer. But along with making a crime caper that involves a kidnapping, we are also given a slow moving plot filled with misleading clues, uneven continuity, numerous twists and red-herrings that don't make much sense. Many questions will be asked as you labor through this torturous drama and it only gets more aggravating and confusing. Why would a police department be so incompetent as to have the parents be committing vigilantism without any surveillance? This is highly unlikely in America, even in rural Midwestern towns. Did the writers bother to consult Law authorities on investigative and forensic procedures? Because they seem non-existent in this unbelievable tale.The most unforgiving and unsympathetic performance is Hugh Jackman's character who completely absconds any sense of responsibility and regard for law, humanity and common sense. As we see him emerging into madness and sadistic rage we quickly lose any empathy for him. How is it that any person can enjoy or be fascinated with the brutal torture of a feeble and mentally incapable simpleton? It's just an exercise in ugliness and perpetuates into the extreme. It was overdone. It would have been more believable if the torture was attempted and later foregone, realizing the method of debriefing wasn't working. Jackman's acting is way over the top and fails to draw any sympathy. Perhaps it was bad acting or a faulty script. It's as if the director was pushing him in a weekly actor's workshop to go the limit with unconstrained rage. It doesn't work.I also was annoyed at Gyllenhall's sleepy performance. For a detective who is supposed to have a stellar record, he sure missed much of the insanity going on with the people involved. This movie is also anti-authority and rebellious in its stance. Showing cops get maligned and disrespected is commonplace as the parents just freely go about their neurotic business of vigilantism.Many times I asked myself, 'Why is this happening? What did that mean? How is this guy involved? How did this old lady ever orchestrate such a kidnapping spree without getting caught? She seems a wee bit too old and frail to be carrying out such a demonic feat with grown men. Why did the other suspect break into the house while the mother was there? What exactly was he after? Why would he show up at a Candlelight vigil and make a spectacle of himself? Lame and stupid plot making. Why wasn't the priest ever a suspect before the kidnapping? You would think the police would be led to clues as to the dead man's whereabouts. Why would the old lady wait for Dover's second visit to constrain him? Was she so certain her demonic plan could rebound after losing one hostage? Most reprehensible is this movie's conviction of wallowing in its own depravity. It fails to make a distinction between what we can assert as truthful and moral behavior and what is incomprehensible behavior. This cheesy tag-line, \"How far would you go?\" only ushers in a weak excuse for someone to go ballistic on anyone they suspect. Even if the person in question has the wrong look in his eye. The question is so bad that it doesn't even deserve to be dignified with an intelligent answer. The question that should be asked is \"How much effort does a caring father need to put forth in order to assure the safety of his family, himself and his daughter?\" By committing abduction and torture he puts himself in jeopardy and his family.I could go on with more questions, but Prisoners doesn't have any redeeming qualities. A plethora of weird clues such as snakes stuffed in crates, the numerous scenes featuring a maze, weird wall paper, bloody clothes add up to nothing in this labyrinth of trash. It's all shock material that is poorly crafted and handled. And it isn't even believable.",

            "content": "The subject matter is one that some might consider overdone, since there have been several movies with the theme of child abduction in recent years, but you don't want to miss this one, because it is so well done and the performances are flawless. The directing and script were a very pleasant surprise to me. Unfamiliar with director Denis Villneuve, whose rating for his previous feature film, Incendies, was outstanding, I now know I'll have to see that one as well as the one that followed, Enemy, also starring Jake Gyllenhaal.The movie starts by placing you in a certain comfort zone with Keller Dover bonding with his son Ralph, respectively played by Hugh Jackman and Dylan Minnette, on their return from a hunting trip; they then join Grace and Erin, mother and daughter, wife and sister played by Maria Bello and Erin Gerasimovich, for a Thanksgiving dinner at their neighbor friends' house. The second couple Franklin and Nancy, the Birch, played by Terrence Howard and Viola Davis and their daughters Eliza and Joy, played by Zoe Borde and Kyla Drew Simmons respectively, are indeed friendly neighbors; they make interracial relationships appealing and seem as normal as it should be (something too seldom mentioned). This will be the only relaxed moment you'll experience, before the drama starts to unfold. Joy and Erin go missing; we can only guess how and when, but that guess may be one of the few you'll get right. The director will smartly leave you with your safe guess as the details are not revealed and need not be.The drama will take you down a few dead ends, to keep you on your toes; and you'll be made to experience the parents frustration with a few of your own, all in the process of keeping you very interested in the next development. With the likes of the actors in this cast, how could you not expect good performances? You get them, and not one character is clich\u00e9, especially detective Loki, played brilliantly by Jake Gyllenhaal. You will be torn by the dilemma 'doing the right thing' vs natural 'instinct' I know most will feel with the performance of H. Jackman, whose character goes beyond wishful thinking on the audience's part. If that wasn't enough, a series of suspects, all despicable but non aggressive will have you spinning with anxious anticipation. Who really abducted the girls, was it a loner or a dark sect, what was the motive if not what first comes to mind (which you'll get wrong by the way).This movie is so well done that the mere expression on Loki's face in the last seconds, before the screen goes to black, tells you immediately what the final outcome is, and you're smartly left to fill in the details to your heart's content. Simply brilliant; you'll be encouraging your friends to see it. I do.",

I just thought it was some Shawshank Redemption film about the wrongfully accused. And I did keep thinking the dad was going to play that role in the first half to two-thirds. But, that couldn't be further from what this great movie was. It's an incredibly well-written, wonderfully acted, deep and moving thriller about two families struggling with the loss of their respective daughters. It's also a definite movie to see at bare minimum a second time.One wonderful (to start with) Thanksgiving, two neighboring families enjoy their meal together and in a blink, two of the family's daughters vanish. When one young male is accused of abducting the girls, one of the rightfully distraught fathers makes it his mission to find his the girls by making the man talk. All the while, a police detective is attempting to find them, too, but using the law and his instincts vs. the emotional father's antics. Probably the only downfall of this movie is that it's just too long. As much as I enjoyed the movie as a whole and all the interesting, sometimes shocking, sometimes very emotional scenes, it just kept going on and on. That said, I am SHOCKED this wasn't nominated for the many awards it deserved. The two leads themselves, Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal alone should've nabbed some competing acting nods, not to mention, best picture and screenplay.While it's easy to compare this to the following year's Gone Girl, they're pretty separate in stories, though close to the thrill of the chase and intrigue. This one was slightly better, and it didn't have Ben Affleck, to boot. So, if you missed this one, but loved Gone Girl, you really need to see this.Actually, just see it, no matter what. It helps if you have small children as you can sympathize, but even without kids, it's still an emotional roller coaster that's great all the way to the ending.***Final thoughts: I don't know why I stayed away so long. So many recommended it to me. It was my invalid vision of what the movie's plot was and hopefully I won't let that happen again. Definitely want to see this again fairly soon.",

Mostly every performance in the film was great but I loved especially Hugh Jackman, Gyllenhaal, Melissa Leo and Paul Dano. Jackman as the father of the missing girl is really believable and he delivers a performance that is truly Oscar worthy. My favorite scene with Jackman is when he meets Gyllenhaal for the first time in his house, you can really tell he is committed to the character but pretty much every scene he's in is great. Gyllenhaal as the detective investigating the case is great and he just continues to prove to me why he's one of my favorite actors. He's so versatile and can play a very wide range of roles. Melissa Leo plays the aunt of Paul Dano who plays a very troubled young man who is treated as a suspect in the film. Both of them are great and Paul Dano delivers a pretty odd and kind of disturbing performance.Prisoners is the kind of movie you think is going a certain way and it mostly does but it shakes it and twists it along the way enough to keep you guessing. From the opening shot you feel the tension of the film that endures until the movie is over. This is mostly thanks to the beautiful cinematography and the smart direction of Villeneuve. He knows exactly where to put the camera in exactly what situation, especially given the talent he had on this production. So prisoners is pretty much an excellent movie, the tone of the movie is defined very early, there is a clear structure and everything is executed beautifully. Everything that happened advanced the plot or developed the characters. It reminded me of a David Fincher film. This is a very different film than Enemy, which was also directed by Villeneuve but they're both amazing films and this is definitely worth a watch.10/10",

            "content": "Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) is facing every parent's worst nightmare. His six-year-old daughter and her friend is kidnapped. Minutes turn into hours, hours turn to days. Keller turn to Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) for help. Their only clue, is that RV has been parked on their street, earlier that day by suspect Alex Jones (Paul Dano). While, Detective Loki is looking for evidence that links Alex Jones to the crime, Keller takes the matter in his own hands; how far will this desperate father go to find his missing daughter? Prisoners is one of the best movies of 2013 in my opinion. It's sure to get a few Oscar nominations. I have to say Hugh Jackson deserve to win, if he does. There is a very powerful scene with him talking to Loki in a car, stating out, how his daughter is looking for him to save her, not Loki. You can't help feeling for this character as he goes through an emotional hell storm. He was a man who can only trust himself. He was a survivalist, and somewhat a paranoid. He prides himself on his strength and independence as a man who can make decisions and get things done alone. That is why he did what he did and he went through a great deal of punishment for it. Keller though loses his way, and ends up in a literal pit in the ground, a \"hell\" as it were. Great use of symbolism. I love the fact that his wife's name is Grace. (Maria Bello). Grace gets more and more lost, as Keller lose more and more of his morals. Basically he has lost the \"grace\" of God through his actions. There are many scenes initially shot through dirty glass that was pretty interesting. Nobody in this film was the clear cut good guy and villain. Remind me of the verse 'Through a glass, darkly' in the Bible. Then, there is the many crosses, including one hanging from the rear-view mirror in Keller's truck. The symbolism doesn't get in the way of the plot, too much until the snakes came into play. I guess, it was a play on the serpent in the Garden of Eden, but it also could had meant the Norse symbol for the god Loki which is two entertained snakes, eating each others' tails which Jake Gyllenhaal is name after. Still, it could had been left out. Then the movie became a symbolism smorgasbord with the endless mazes, one eye themes, opening Pandora's boxes, tattoos, free-mason rings, and that got the plot more confusing. Research all the examples, I have stated out. You find yourself, surprising in depth this movie goes. Trust me, the plot will get confusing. I had to watch it, multiply times to get all the twist and turns. It was a maze of suspects. The allegory of the prison is a significant theme throughout the film. Each character, whether psychologically or physically, is the subject of some kind of confinement. Without giving it away, the ending of the film is a brilliant bittersweet ending, that can be seem as both a happy and tragic at the same time. A lot of parents will be hugging their children tonight after watching this film. A few people might not like this movie due to its controversial subject matter. I think some Christian conservative might find the movie as liberal anti-Christian propaganda that makes Christians look bad. I didn't see it that way. I think a certain Alex Jones in the world, might, but I see Keller going through the same emotions if he wasn't a Christian. The characters put into huge stressful tragic events that makes them challenge their own faith. I think the use of faith was highly welcome into this film. It made the film interesting with its symbolism. The second thing, people didn't like is the animal abuse. First off, no animals were harm during the filming of this film. Second off, the killing of the deer makes more morality sense than it's made out to be. Deer can actually overpopulate an area and starve the local species if not controlled. Some states have actual contracts with hunters to maintain a quota by cutting the herd. Then there is the dog scene. Let's remember, Alex Jones is not a smart guy, so it would make sense that he wouldn't know how to handle a dog. I hate to see PETA boycott the film over those, without understanding the facts and story. The movie isn't about the animals, but looking for kidnap children. People coming in, should focus more that, then what happen to the animals. The question comes down to morals and ethics. The acting is amazing. It's seems to me that Jake Gallenhaal's Loki is such an interesting character that fans of the film is asking for a spin-off movie. By the way, Loki blink so much, is probably because he is a detective, and they rarely sleep. At less, that what I got from his character development. It's a very long movie directed by Denise Villeneuve, but not boring. It was a very tense film with little slow areas. Overall, it's can be a bit depressing, but the thrill factor made this movie bearable to watch and it deserve the critical acclaim that it got.",

My heart started beating after the first fifteen minutes and kept on until the very end. That's how much suspense there is in this film. The film is very long (153 minutes), but never bores or slows down. In fact, I enjoyed every new plot twist because it would make the suspense last longer. If you like intelligent thrillers, you shouldn't miss this one. It keeps you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end. The story is quite complicated, but during the film it turns out every piece of the puzzle fits perfectly. In fact, some elements I only figured out after returning home. The start of the movie is very strong. Two happy families, visiting each other for Thanksgiving, enjoy a nice evening until they realize that the two young daughters are missing. Both couples react differently. After the police releases the only suspect because they can't find anything against him, one of the fathers decides to take matters into his own hands. His despair makes his sense of what's right and wrong disappear. Apart from the very good script, other strong points are the cinematography, showing cold, rainy forests in shades of grey, and the acting. Jake Gyllenhaal plays the lone, tough detective Loki, who is determined to solve the case against all odds. He works alone, doesn't have a family and never smiles. Even after the case is solved and he is visited in hospital by one of the mothers, he doesn't show any emotion at all. The film contains some graphic violence, and also has some rather creepy moments. This is not a nice, easy, polished film. It has some rough edges and a dark intensity. That's why I liked it.",

So I was surprised to find more.It's anchored, on one end in the thriller with clear mechanics that goes back to Fritz Lang, the modern intuitions about space on the other. Jackman and the other actors inhabit the first, Deakins finds his room in the second. In one mode evil is concrete, in the other elusive. Seven was in the first, Zodiac more in the second, the film traverses both. Here we start with the disappearance of two girls and gradually acquire a story. Two men are struggling to, father and cop, one goes on faith the other reason. One and then a second culprit appear, somehow connected.The whole idea, eerily effective, is that we build loci of observation, that we have enough observation at any time only to justify a faith about what we convince ourselves to be true, either of the boys being guilty, so in being yanked from one to the other and back that faith is shaken and shakes our grounds of truth and humanity. Innocents suffer as a result. Meanwhile evil is something so banal and in plain sight, the more horrifying suggestion, also seen in the location of the makeshift prison(s).The thriller worked for me more than most in recent memory, but the most striking moments were in the second mode, the visual and elusive. As the girl's memory comes to her in the hospital bed, we have three or four shots that communicate that whole range, each of them expertly timed, each blurry in some way. And the manic driving to save the girl in time, here we have her soul between worlds, his rush to redemption, visually transcendent in the night traffic of this world.Overall it paints a tormented picture; evil, originally a shattered faith as we find, exists out there, we come close to knowing, the father, the cop, the kid who sketches mazes, but something eludes us in the way things are made, which can be as simple as the father not being able to make himself believed about what he heard in the parking lot, and as complicated as what he heard not being what he thinks. So I'm not in line with the glum worldview, I am somewhat with the latter, the difficulties of faith and clarity, tied to watching. It's a Christian vision to be sure, the world as prison, faith inescapably woven with sin. Interestingly, that pessimism emerges in the Christian mind as you move away from the early days and the \"father's\" coming is delayed. I followed the other day a link to an article about Christian leaders professing the religious significance of Aronofosky's upcoming Noah, how it makes the old story vibrantly relevant for a modern audience. I'd like to see them confront this, which really demands confrontation.",

            "content": "Writing about James Fennimore Cooper, D.H. Lawrence said, \"the essential American soul is hard, stoic, isolate and a killer. It has never yet melted.\" Prisoners is a Canadian director's meditation on this passage.Michael Mann's The Last of the Mohicans opened with Hawkeye shooting a deer and then praying over the dead animal. Prisoners opens with Keller Dover (Jackman) saying the Lord's Prayer as his teenaged son sights in and shoots the deer that will be Thanksgiving dinner. The parallel is no accident. Dover thinks of himself as the Deerslayer. He's a self-employed, self-reliant workman with a basement full of canned goods and ammunition stored against the breakdown of society, which he expects at any time. He's a survivalist and a handloader. He lives in a nondescript former industrial town somewhere in the part of Pennsylvania that James Carville described as Alabama. His suburban house is the smallest in the neighborhood, with the siding stained dark brown, looking like a log cabin. His only vehicle is the pickup truck from his contracting business. He seems to have come down in the world from his late father, whom he revered, and he's just barely keeping up with the mortgage. Though not a political word is spoken, he's prime Tea Party material. His belief in himself and his disdain for institutions are going to be tested to the extreme when his five year old daughter and her neighborhood playmate disappear, victims of an apparent abduction, on Thanksgiving afternoon.This is a foreigner's take on the United States. The director, Denis Villeneuve, is a French-Canadian whose last movie, 2010s Incindies, was a perceptive look at the Lebanon civil war of the 70s and 80s. Villeneuve is looking at a society whose individualism, distrust of authority, and general availability of firearms are very different from Canada, and he does not take those things for granted in the same way an American director would. Prisoners makes an interesting companion to this summer's Still Mine, a Canadian story about an old fashioned self-employed individualist who falls foul of local authority in rural New Brunswick. I've long thought that the Canadians are King George's dutiful children while Americans are his rebellious ones, and the two pictures set off the contrast nicely. This is an anthropological look by a Canadian at what a very American man like Keller Dover might do when his child is kidnapped.Villeneuve uses one of the more annoying tropes in American movies to humanize Dover \u2013 the Validating Black Guy. Cousin to the Magic Negro, who puts the white protagonist in touch with deeper values, the VBG's function is simpler \u2013 to show that this white man, regardless of his other faults, is actually all right because he likes black people and they like him. Dover's neighbor, friend and one-time high school buddy Franklin Birch (Howard) and wife Nancy (Davis) are cast as black because otherwise Keller Dover would come across as a complete redneck.But the essence of the Birches is class, not race. They live in a nicer house and are much more securely in the middle class than the Dovers. Nancy's a veterinarian and Franklin looks like he has some kind of office job. Their function is to react as decent, normal middle class folks would when their daughter is abducted and when Dover goes off the rails looking for the kidnapper. The parallel with our reactions to 9/11 is pretty obvious, but that's not where the movie ultimately goes.The spousal relations break pretty clearly along class and historical lines. Nancy and Franklin Birch are a contemporary married couple of the upper middle class. They pull each other through. He confides in her, she's probably the stronger of the pair, and her moral judgments are the last word between them. The Dovers are almost 19th century. Grace Dover (an under-used Maria Bello) is passive; a pure housewife who looks to Keller as her protector and hero. She breaks completely under the strain, spending all of her time in bed under sedation. Her husband is content to have it so, keeping his activities secret and warning his son not to let his mother know what is going on.Dover's opposite number and antagonist is Detective Loki, the star of this small town police force, and apparently the only detective on the case. (I find this improbable. For a crime like the abduction of two five year old girls, a one horse police department would get overwhelming support from State Police detectives). Loki is zealous, smart, though not as smart as he thinks, and willing to fall back on shouting and violence when nothing else seems to work. He's cracked every case he ever worked on, and he expects to crack this one. He's also got the official mindset that regards Keller Dover's insistent involvement as a clear nuisance if not something worse. But he's got far more energy and drive than his police chief, a mediocre man who has learned to rationalize mediocrity with philosophical resignation.The plot is full of trap doors and red herrings, and you have to pay very close attention to the dialog to pick up what you need to know. Even if you do, I think that one key element is left unexplained. You will be completely involved in what comes next for two and one-half hours, and there will be a lot to chew on when it's over. Definitely worth it.",

Prisoners has its contrivances, and a few dubious character actions, but always at the service of telling a gripping story, and asking some challenging questions.The film opens with the Dover clan, headed by Keller (Hugh Jackman), visiting the Birch family for Thanksgiving dinner. Contentment and complacency abounds. The two youngest kids go outside and don't come back. The dawning horror of the parents, and the rapid escalation in panic, is horribly and heartbreakingly played out. Keller is convinced that the child-minded neighbour Alex (Paul Dano) is the culprit. So when lonesome Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal, practically reprising his role from Zodiac, except now with new End of Watch tattoos) can find no evidence, Keller takes matters \u2013 and Alex \u2013 into his own bloody hands.The rain. It hasn't poured so much in a detective thriller since Se7en \u2013 and the mood is similarly doom-drenched. There are elements of Silence of the Lambs as well, although Prisoners is a film of subtler autumn shades. It's not as stark and austere as Markus Schleinzer's Michael, but it strikes the same eerie mood, and likewise moves at a pleasingly slow pace.The performances are excellent. Gyllenhaal's wide eyes seem here to have had their naivety washed out by horror; Loki blinks hard like he's photographing all he sees. As for Keller, we first see him stalking prey. He's a predatory animal, an aggressive protector, and grief will translate into ferociousness. Jackman, a most likable screen presence, must work extra hard to fight off our sympathy. Then there are the wives. Maria Bello's Grace appears passive, but this is simply a reflection of her pragmatic husband's inability to connect with her emotionally. Nancy Birch (Viola Davis, typically intense) stays at her husband's side, gradually becoming dominant, fuelled by the agony of loss and the even worse agony of hope.There are some truly memorable moments in Prisoners. The scene in which Loki discovers child-sized boxes in the house of a suspect is pure Hitchcock brilliance. Later, his bloody-eyed race through busy traffic is probably the most thrilling car chase of the year \u2013 the stakes could not be higher. And the scene involving Keller, a bathroom, and a claw hammer is harrowing on multiple levels: the drama is in the intention.Prisoners is distressing without being repulsive; moving without being sentimental; thrilling without being exploitative. This is the standard to which all mainstream drama should aspire.",

Viola Davis and Maria Bello were very raw and convincing as the wives but it was Jackman and Gyllenhaal that stole the show. A gripping a visceral tale about two girls being abducted and their parents and the Detective who is investigating the disappearance's experiences. It's a rather twisted psychological drama, cleverly written and powerfully performed. Set in (fairly) small-town America with poignant crises of faith adding a shadow and depth to the tragedy. Clues along the way were subtle and the unwinding plot was natural and not contrived. It was an intelligent film.Tense and edge of the seat all the way through, made darker by the weather, and simple non-SFX almost old fashioned filming. It had a vintage seventies feel, despite being set in modern times. It made the viewer question morality, choices and how far you would go to protect your own. Jackman's descent into desperation was relatable and understandable. His scenes with the Paul Dano were terrifyingly good.Dark but essential cinema viewing. Brave performances by all actors and great direction and screenplay. You may feel shredded as the credits roll. Possibly 9/10, not sure yet. Highly recommend it, but don't sit anywhere near chatting teenagers, you'll need to concentrate.",

            "content": "Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal are absolutely powerful in Director Denis Villeneuve's dark and mesmerizing \"Prisoners\". \"Prisoners\" has the look and resonance of Clint Eastwood's \"Mystic River\". This haunting morality play is one of best movies of the year. Jackman gives perhaps his best and most unexpected performance. Jackman's sheer ferocity in the tipping point of human conscience is amazing to behold. His bold vulnerability clutches our very soul. This is equally surprising given his signature as the Wolverine. I literally cringed as he threatens terrified Paul Dano as Alex with a steel hammer. In stark contrast there is a quiet scene as tears stream down his cheek as he stares at police photos. Gyllenhaal as Jackman's antagonist foil is an undeniable force. Much like Kevin Bacon in \"Mystic River\" Gyllenhaal's Detective Loki struggles between duty and the visceral justice. Villeneuve and Writer Guzikowski curiously never spell out Loki's physical glitches neither the gang banger tattoos. Have to admire them for respecting audience intelligence. Gyllenhaal's immersion is breathtaking whether he is comforting Viola Davis's Nancy about her missing daughter or smashing the head of suspect on a table. His screen partnership with Jackman is awesome, we witness amazing actors at the zenith of their prowess. Villeneuve is brilliant in restraining and balancing such intense performances without sacrificing purpose. We first hear Jackman's voice as Keller Dover reciting The Lord's Prayer on a deer hunting trip with his son Ralph (Dylan Minnette, who is going to surprise many). Keller is a struggling carpenter, and closet survivalist. He is a family man and man of faith. Aaron Guzikowski's story's deceptive power lies in the normalcy of a Pennsylvania suburb. He foreshadows the tragic forfeit as the ends overcome the means. Roger Deakins's (\"True Grit\") cinematography is a profound character onto itself bestowing pristine clarity in this conflict of dark and gray. The Dovers' spend Thanksgiving with Frank and Nancy Birch (Terrence Howard and Viola Davis). The terrifying realization sets in that their youngest daughters Anna (Erin Gerasimovich) and Joy (Kyla Drew Simmons) are missing. After frantic search in the rain, Police are called. A creepy suspect Alex Jones (brilliantly unnerving Paul Dano) emerges as the possible kidnapper. Alex also has the mind of a 10 year old. Alex is released without any solid evidence. However, Keller is convinced from an admission by Alex, that he knows where his daughter Anna is. He takes matters into his own, and imprisons Alex and tortures him until he tells him what he wants. Howard's Franklin is mortified by Keller's actions. Keller says, \"Someone had to make him talk, or they're going to die!\" Viola Davis as Nancy is rock solid in shocking advocacy. Mario Bello as Keller's wife Grace is sympathetic grace as a mother suffering the unthinkable. Melissa Leo is amazing as Holly Jones, Alex's Aunt and guardian. Her ordinary persona belies tragedy.All is not what seems. Keller and Loki have the same purpose in divergent paths, and make costly sacrifices. Villeneuve reminds that sometimes the world is ugly, and in resolution our souls are in the balance. Jackman and Gyllenhaal are awesome. The cast is amazing. \"Prisoner\" is not a pleasant movie to watch--not at all. \"Prisoners\" has profound power.",

They were kidnapped by the surviving widow of a couple who went round kidnapping kids in order to make people lose their faith in God, after their own son died of cancer. The nephew they adopted, who is unable to string a sentence together much, is suspected, abducted and tortured to death by Hugh Jackman, the blonde girl's father. At the end Hugh is drugged and bleeding in a deep hole, blowing a whistle which Jake G. may or may not hear.There. If I can save just one person from having to endure this pile of dung, then my life will have had meaning.You might think there would be fun to be had by pointing out complete nonsenses in the plot, characters and script of this film. There are so many, however, that it gets tedious. Just off the top of my head, then...1. It rains and snows, heavily, all the time. However, Hugh Jackman is dumped in a pothole which miraculously remains completely dry, despite being covered only by a bit of tin and an old car.2. In such abduction cases, the parents are usually initially considered prime suspects until eliminated. Despite the fact that Hugh Jackman is hysterical, violent, defensive and alcoholic, Jake Gylllenhall doesn't even have his house searched. The half-bag of lye he finds in his later casual inspection of the garage gets mentioned, then dropped.3. Jake Gyllenhall assaults a suspect in custody, with the result that the suspect manages to shoot himself (yes, the 'gun in mouth, blood on the wall' trope again). Such a cop would be IMMEDIATELY suspended. Not our Jake, however.4. Jake G arrests a priest who confesses to having imprisoned to death the husband of the evil couple in his cellar. Once that point is established, the priest and any reference to him completely disappears.5. Blonde girl's mother, after having suffered hell for a week or so, blithely tells other parent to wheel her just-rescued daughter out of the room for a little while while she talks to the cop.6. The maverick cop releases dozens of snakes into the community, without apparently bothering to determine whether they are venomous, valuable, or what; or bothering to retain them as evidence.Oh dear. There are many enormous red herrings and dead ends in the plot of Prisoners, but not with any logic behind them. A character or artifact is placed to suggest one plot turn, then dropped immediately when another comes up (eg the 'Maze' thing). This is the sort of plotting that children in junior school do. And much better, as a rule. For the avoidance of doubt, this is a TERRIBLE film.",

A hunt is put forward, and the only suspect seems to be a retarded man who was in a RV outside the house at the time. He is detained and soon released for lack of evidence, but the hothead father of one of the girls (Hugh Jackman, in a spectacular performance) decides to pursue the man and eventually kidnaps and tortures him in order to get information. But this is just the beginning, since there is almost two hours more of film.This thriller seems very exciting at the hour point, but in the latter part descends into a tiresome series of twists and dead herrings. By the time the running time of two hours and a half has past, the audience is exhausted. The movie also suffers from serious leaps in logic and even basic continuity (WARNING: I will reveal some spoilers now): 1) when the retarded man is detained, the house where he lives with his aunt is apparently never thoroughly searched though it will turn out to be the place where the girls were held captive, 2) when other suspect kills himself in the police station, this is news in the local newspaper, but one policeman investigating the case is apparently unaware of it, 3) this whole subplot with the seeming suspect played by David Dastmalchian is never fully explained (and how he got a gun to kill himself?), 4) I find it unbelievable that the other parent (Terrence Howard) agrees to torture the suspect.Maria Bello gives a fine performance as the troubled wife of Jackman.

Polanski, De Palma, Hitchcock, and Demme come to mind. Here is a director who has availed himself of what could rank with the best scripts ever written: a piece so tightly constructed is almost impossible to look away. We are grabbed right away when the children are abducted, and slowly the grip tightens until it's almost unbearable. We want to know the truth, we want to relax and hope for the best, but this is not going to be a smooth ride by any means.Two daughters disappear during the holidays. We have obvious suspects, but as we soon learn, the investigation will not be short or simple. The trail grows cold, and we have many frustrated parties. The police hits a dead end. One of the parents goes absolutely mad with rage and despair. Another succumbs when she is unable to look at evil on the face. The other couple feels helpless, and the younger siblings are also undergoing their own torment.One of the suspects appears unable to communicate what he might know, and this leads him to become an abducted of sorts. Before we notice, we have another possible criminal darting and out of the picture. In less capable hands, we would feel like we're being cheated, but this is a valid move by the writers, and it pays off handsomely in the end. A maze becomes an essential key to solving the problem, but this maze is a hell of a challenge.As we reach the last third of the film, we begin to reach the conclusion, but instead of losing steam, the film becomes even more gripping, giving us satisfaction unlike nothing seen in recent movies. The last time I sat at the edge of my chair was in 1991 when Clarisse wandered into hell at the end of her quest. There is an obvious tribute to that film here, and it will be talked about for ages because it at the forefront in this film's conclusion, a moment that is bound to become a classic.Jackman, Davis, Howard, Leo, Bello, and Gyllenthal do some of the best work in decades, but if we are to single out a performance, we have Jackman as the tortured father who might not like what he discovers as he searches for his daughter. It is a devastating performance, one to be studied and discussed because it shows what an actor is able to do with the right support: a beautiful script, a director who values and understand what is important in the making of a movie and doesn't rely on technology or gimmicks, and an actor who knows that in order to play any role, he must dig deep and not hold back. Jackman does just this and we are in awe.Just remember these words: THE END. The way you see any other conclusion this year will never be the same.",

            "content": "\"Prisoners\" is a searing film that takes a scenario we've seen many times before and stands it on its head. The film is about the abduction of two young girls and the way it effects their families and the police who search for them. It has a circular maze as one of its central motifs, and also has a maze of a plot. As Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman), the distraught father of one of the girls takes the law into his own hands and remorselessly pursues one of the suspects, he becomes at odds with Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) who hunts down other leads.Both men work through the maze of clues from opposite directions with pieces of the puzzle slowly dropping into place. Finally it all comes together in a disturbing climax. When a thriller this good comes along, we tend to start making comparisons with the greats of the genre, Hitchcock and Polanski or more recently Demme and Fincher, but if this movie reminds me of anything it's the Dutch version of George Sluizer's \"The Vanishing\". Not so much in superficial similarities, but because both films share a quality that was perfectly summed up by British actor Brian Cox \u2013 desolation. Although Cox was talking about Woody Allen's \"Match Point\", it's the lack of comfortable closure that generates that feeling, and all three films have it. With that said however, French Canadian filmmaker, Denis Villeneuve, is a man who rejects categorising. \"I'm not necessarily a thriller fan\", he says, \"I didn't want to make a thriller; I'm not so attracted to genre. I thought the thriller elements inside the movie were just a vehicle for something more interesting: the dramatic and moral aspects of the story\".Although we expect Jake Gyllenhaal to stretch himself in every role; it is Hugh Jackman who really challenges himself here. As Villeneuve said of him, \"Good actors reach a point in their career where they just have an urge, an artistic need to explore new territory; they don't want to be prisoners of their own image and Hugh chose 'Prisoners' to move outside his comfort zone\". Jackman nails the part of the self-made, self-reliant man who refuses to simply accept things as they stand.Despite improvisation on the set by Villeneuve and the cast, much of the credit for the film's power must go to the script by Aaron Guzilowski.When Villeneuve was given a choice of scripts after receiving serious Hollywood attention following the release of \"Polytechnique\", he chose Guzilowski's script. There are no red herrings in the story; everything in \"Prisoners\" has meaning and fits into the maze. It's such a cleverly thought out plot, brought to life on the screen by Villeneuve and his crew plus a perfect cast. Although Villeneuve says he doesn't want to be pigeonholed in the thriller genre, lets hope he makes a few more visits before he hangs up the megaphone and folds the canvas chair.",

            "content": "The most complex thing to think about the film Prisoners is why any of the Oscar nominated or recognisably 'serious' actors agreed to be in it in the first place. While it is clearly meant to be, judging by the blind critical reaction, a tense, thought provoking, violent and difficult film, I found it to be too dreary, too melodramatic, too obvious and, most importantly, too long.There are few films that can, successfully, keep me gripped for 2hrs35min. JFK is one and that other Gyllenhaal detective drama Zodiac is another but what they had, that Prisoners forgot, was a complex, gripping detective narrative with possibly many solutions and actual characters. It is in these two areas that Prisoners woefully falls short.Focussing, for the moment, on the little good in the film, Prisoners is very well shot by seasoned director of photography, Roger Deakins and not badly played by the starry, Oscar grabby cast, not that they're given a whole lot to work with.That being said, my first problem with the kidnapping plot is that it was obvious. If you, like my wife and I, indulge your silly brain cells every week by watching 45min detective procedurals like The Mentalist, Castle, Elementary, White Collar or whatever, then you will see the ending of the film coming a mile away. This is because, the way it was set up and as it continued to play out, there was only a handful of ways it could play out. Now, I'm sure, for those not so used to the simple twists and turns of evening TV, Prisoners may have been a gripping whodunit but, I am sorry, if you've read any, even mildly, detective orientated books or watched a Murder She Wrote then you'll know the plot, like I did, 45mins in and will have to sit there for another 1hr and 45mins waiting for surly, grumpy, tattooed Jake Gyllenhaal to work it out too. Which he eventually does but even his, supposedly brilliant, 'never lost a case' detective is beaten to the punch by 'very angry indeed' Hugh Jackman.Gyllenhaal's detective is supposed, I am guessing, to be a tortured, dogged genius but we never see any evidence of him really doing anything insightful or perceptive, he's not a fantastic puzzle solver, good with people particularly and there doesn't appear to be a great intellect pounding away inside his furrow browed, slicked back haired head. It struck me as one of those characters him and the director talked endlessly about but forgot to put any of the motivations into the actual script. We are told in dialogue he is brilliant and we are just meant to take it as read, despite the fact that all he does is mundane and routine investigation. Yes he has tattoos, a grumpy face and spends thanksgiving alone in Chinese restaurants but apart from that, we have no idea what makes him tick, oh and his superiors and the police around him are also woefully inept.Jackman is a survivalist, all American, possible religious nut who is also an alcoholic with an atrociously bad temper bubbling underneath a, not very interesting, surface. I was never sure if we were meant to side with him so that, we the audience, were complicit in his violent actions later on but seeing as I didn't really like him from the get go and seeing as I suspected that probably Paul Dano's massively red herring probably wasn't the bad guy (just by watching the trailer) that didn't really work for me. I actually found his reaction a little unrealistic and over the top but then I also found Paul Dano's character as annoyingly, idiotically stubborn as Jackman found him. Mind of a 10 year old or not, traumatised or not, I didn't buy for one second he'd stay silent for as long as he does, when he had no problem talking to Gyllenhaal's character for an apparent 10hr interrogation (we're told and see on video).Maria Bello, Viola Davis & Terrence Howard are all shockingly underused and irrelevant (mostly) and poor Melissa Leo is left playing, what slides very close to being, a comical old grandma part. Complete with bad clothes, huge glasses and a terrible wig. I am, personally, amazed that this film got made the way it did at all and, secondly, amazed that people love it so much. It's not that it's a bad film. It's fine. It just felt very obvious, mundane, grim and too long.",

Or simply something that just looks like a rehash.I agree the references are pretty obvious when you know your genre but the flow of narration does not leave you time to think about it, which is exactly the point about good references only making the basic elements of a new story. Aside from all the critics you can dismiss as the Icebox Logic moaners, I agree that at some point you may want the characters to connect the dots faster. But you see the characters squinting, blinking because they can never have a good sleep and they are grasping at straws so the direction perfectly impounds your train of thought to make it secondary to the characters' emotional distress and personal struggles.In the end this cannot be as strong a movie as The Vanishing (1988) although they aim to encapsulate this also, but it masterfully mixes different point of views without doing one too many and only just barely stretching the emergency timeline.In other words I don't feel like being finicky in retrospect when I am dealing with guys who absolutely know what they are doing.",

The kids are at play - older kids Ralph (Dylan Minnette, Let Me In) and Eliza (Zoe Soul, The Purge: Anarchy) downstairs watching TV, younger children Anna and Joy outside.Earlier, they girls had been playing on an RV and the older kids had gotten them away from it. But now, the younger children are nowhere to be found. Soon, a massive police manhunt is underway.Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal, forever Spider-Man to me) finds the RV outside a gas station and chases its occupant: Alex Jones (Paul Dano, Little Miss Sunshine). The man has the IQ of a child and his RV is clean, but Kelly wants him kept in jail. The police, however, can't do that.Loki explores every lead he has, including looking up sex offenders in the area, such as Father Dunn, a priest who killed a man and buried him in his basement. That man informed him that he was at war with God and had already killed 16 children.Alex is released as TV cameras roll and Kelly attacks him, right after the man says, \"They didn't cry until I left them.\" No one but Kelly hears this. He follows the suspect on his own, without the police, and when he hears the man sing the song his daughter sang the day she was taken, he snaps.Using the building his father willed him that has gone dormant, Alex is beaten and tortured for what he knows. Jackman is excellent in these scenes and was encouraged to push his rage as far as it could go. It shows.Loki is still on the case but his attention is divided between keeping track of Kelly and searching for a mysterious man who attended the candlelight vigil for the girls. That suspect, Bob Jones, lives in a house covered by mazes, with giant plastic storage bins filled with snakes and articles of children's' clothing covered by pig blood. Frustrated that he can't solve the case - he's never lost one before - Loki attacks Jones in the interrogation room. In the confusion, Jones grabs a gun and kills himself. The police figure that he never killed the girls or took them - he just wanted to be part of this. Loki thinks there's something more.Kelly continues torturing Alex, who also nearly escapes his interrogation in a scene that mirrors the one where Jones grabbed the gun. He finally confesses that the girls are lost in the maze, which is intercut with Loki matching the maze drawings that Bob Jones did with the necklace of the man he found in the basement of Father Dunn.When Joy is found alive, she says to Kelly, \"You were there.\" What does this mean? Well, I don't want to spoil any more of the story. It's too good.Jackman, Gyllenhaal, Paul Dano and Melissa Leo (who appears in heavy makeup as Alex Jones' aunt) are all astounding in this. In particular, Gyllenhaal and Dano make some really interesting choices for their takes on their characters. However, soem advice: Dano speaks incredibly low. Watch his scenes with close captioning on or you will miss some integral parts of the plot.Denis Villeneuve director is assured, with a slow-building suspense throughout the film, including some long pauses on static shots in the open. He's since directed Sicario, Arrival and Blade Runner 2049.Writer Aaron Guzikowski started writing this film back in 2007, where it ended up on The Black List, which contains the most popular unproduced screenplays in Hollywood. Afterward, he wrote the script for remake of Soviet film Reykjav\u00edk-Rotterdam called Contraband (which has nothing to do with Fulci's movie, despite me getting the wrong DVD several times when I tried to order that film) and he is currently working on a reboot of The Wolf Man.",

            "content": "Spoilers ahead. Not that it matters.Oh my, what a waste of top talent and resources. This could have been a taut, effective, thoughtful little thriller, but the ridiculous plot holes and logical inconsistencies doom it (along with its unnecessary length). The Hugh Jackman character is such a glaring box-checking conceit that it diminishes any complexity I'm pretty sure we're MEANT to appreciate about him. Religious? Check. Hard-working common man? Check. Struggling in these dire economic times? Check. Adorable, loving family? Check. Tragic family event in past that molded his character? Check. Ironic plot development? Check. (The doomsday prepper gets burned; but wait, that whistle did come in handy, as we knew it would.) OK, let's stop there. I'm not saying the plight of the parents was not moving. Who is not moved by children in jeopardy, parents in misery? It's difficult to not see plots like this in terms of the basest exploitation. But it takes a sure and subtle hand to make it work, and that was obviously missing here. Many have compared it to Mystic River, which is apt, though that was a far finer film, and more believable as a police procedural. I imagine the screenwriter and director wanted us to take a hard look at what might happen when a good man goes bad for all the right reasons, but the lengths he goes to in torturing the Paul Dano character just don't make sense. Yes, maybe that's the point: Keller is beyond \"sense.\" OK, but when the two other parents acquiesce to the torture (albeit somewhat reluctantly, but still), I wanted to throw something at the screen.While I'm still on \"character,\" Jake Gyllenhaal's detective is an absolute cipher. Maybe this was a decision NOT to give him a backstory of any kind because that would be lame. Fine. But in place of that we get a bad haircut, shirt-buttoned-all-the-way-but-no-tie look, some twitchy blinking, and not much else. I was rooting for him mostly because he wasn't actively torturing anyone.Other complaints:*One detective seems to be assigned to this very explosive case. Other than combing the fields for bodies, no one else seems involved in the \"investigation.\" OK, this was probably a decision so the focus would be on Loki (his name,really?) and not on some partner chitchat, and at a 2 hr., 33 min. runtime, I should shut up about it, but it so goes against any police reality, that I couldn't forgive it. *Gyllenhaal makes a decision pretty early that the Paul Dano character is innocent, and so he is released - without surveillance and without police protection, even though Jackman's character has already attacked him. Yes, I know, some perfunctory BS scene with Gyllenhaal's superior was included to explain why there was no surveillance, but that also was stupid. He was their only real suspect. And a search of his aunt's property didn't reveal . . . drugs, syringes, handguns, sedated girls? Nobody looked into the history of this little \"farmily\"? The aunt is taken at her word about everything. Oh wait . . . she had to be, or Hugh Jackman could not have kidnapped Paul Dano and we wouldn't have a movie.*The priest has a dead body in the basement. Obviously, he takes his vow about confessions more seriously than the commandment about murder. Oh, and that dead body turns out to be . . . Well, you know if you saw it.*The abandoned apartment where Dano is held is never searched (convenient new suspect emerges at critical juncture, too busy to send someone else over there to do a thorough search).*Red herring to end all red herrings: deranged young man with mazes, snakes, pig blood, buried mannequins, stolen children's clothing. *Just in general: too much crazy in too limited a geographical space (see Priest, Snake Boy, Crazy Aunt).*One child escapes . . . while heavily sedated? Crazy aunt nonetheless stays put, does not kill remaining child immediately. Why she was keeping them alive in the first place is not convincingly explained.*ONE person deciding that a dead child means warring with God and creating \"demons\" by abducting and killing other people's children is a just response to personal tragedy is far-fetched (not impossible, certainly), but TWO! Good times. Of course, the Man suffers a crisis of conscience apparently and confesses to the wrong priest. The Woman (female of the species and all that) has to keep muddling along, killing when she gets a chance. Times are tough (the recession applies to child abduction too). *The maze symbol is both too obvious (morally) and too opaque. Dead guy in basement wearing one, crazy crime re-enactor draws them, imprisoned Dano whispers it? Connection unclear.I wish I had that whistle at the end, so someone would have come and saved me from this movie.",

Dover and his family attend a Thanksgiving dinner over at their friend's house, Franklin and Nancy Birch, played by Terrence Howard and Viola Davis. It is there that both family's six year old girls, Anna and Joy, go missing. Jake Gyllenhaal, as Detective Loki, is assigned to the case but is unable to put Dover at ease. This creates a conflict between the confident detective and the frantic father. It's not long before Alex Jones, played by Paul Dano, is arrested under suspicion for the girls disappearance but due to a lack of evidence, he is released. As Detective Loki continues on with the investigation, Dover, in desperation and out of fear for his daughter's life, decides to take matters into his own hands.Everyone involved in this production, including actress Maria Bello as Dover's wife, Grace, are at the top of their game. Hugh Jackman has never been better, surpassing his performance in The Fountain. Jake Gyllenhaal is no longer seen as Donnie Darko here. Detective Loki proves to be not only his most powerful performance but also the best character he has ever played. In fact, Detective Loki might be the best on-screen detective we've seen in well over a decade. All the amazing performances aside, everything about Prisoners is perfectly executed. Cinematography by the best director of photography working today, Roger Deakins. The haunting music, provided by the masterful Icelandic composer, J\u00f3hann J\u00f3hannsson, is used to maximum effect. Canadian director Denis Villeneuve has brought Aaron Guzikowski's screenplay to life without cutting any corners or wasting any expense.Prisoners is a painful character study within the most thrilling mystery put to the big screen since Hitchcock defined the genre. Villeneuve has perfectly balanced the ambiguity and ambition of a modern art-film with an entertaining Hollywood thriller. Even with a running time over two and a half hours, the suspense never stops. In fact, it will continue to linger long after the credits finish rolling.",

            "content": "The movie \"Prisoners\" simply starts with two families, the Dovers and the Birches, in a nondescript town, sharing a Thanksgiving dinner. Then the two youngest members of both families, Anna Dover (Erin Gerasimovich) and Joy Birch (Kyla Drew Simmons) go to play outside supposedly under Anna's older brother Ralph's supervision. They get close to a next-door neighbor's RV, but quickly leave when a pair of ominous eyes stare at them from inside. Soon after, both nine-year old girls are missing and apparently kidnapped. Methodical, persistent Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal), with a perfect case-solving record, strives to find out who abducted the children and why. There are a few suspects, but the most prominent one is Alex Jones (Paul Dano), a child-like young man who lives with caretaker aunt Holly (Melissa Leo) and who is arrested after violently trying to flee Loki and the police in the same RV. So now it's simply a matter of getting Alex to confess to the crime and reveal where the two girls are - isn't it?Perhaps,it's not so simple. \"Prisoners\" spins an elaborate, deliberate, and intelligent mystery with its share of clues, red herrings, and frustrating dead ends. But I believe the movie's primary focus IS reflected in its nuanced title and how the characters react to it. Both families, including Grace Dover (Maria Bello), Franklin Birch (Terrence Howard), and Nancy Birch (Viola Davis) are understandably psychologically imprisoned by anxiety, suspense, tension, and horror at their loss - almost to the point of inertia. However, Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) is not so passive. He is imprisoned by more than just fear; he seethes with vengeance and wrath. He is not satisfied with what he sees as cursory treatment of primary suspect Alex by Loki and the police and is enraged by Alex's release from custody due to insufficient evidence. Insufficient evidence, hell! Keller, a home renovator, has his own ways of making Alex talk...As the mystery progresses, \"Prisoners\" takes the time to explore Keller's struggle between justice and revenge and the viewer's attitude toward his actions. As Keller retaliates with his own kidnapping and subsequent torture of Alex, I think many viewers will simultaneously sympathize with and be repelled by Keller's behavior. If we lost a child, of course many of us would rage, and swear, and be spurred to some kind of action. But would we do the things Keller does to Alex, things that begin to border on the sadistic? As it winds toward the kidnapping resolution, the revelation of the culprit, Alex's fate, and, surprisingly, Keller's ironic fate, \"Prisoners\" reminds us that no situation, even a kidnapping and possible torture, justifies letting ourselves being imprisoned by mindless and perhaps misguided vengeance. In this regard, Detective Loki provides contrast. Even though he gets violently frustrated by the case, Loki's professionalism and logic keep him on course and help him progress in his investigation. Keller does not do the same for most of the movie until it's too late. Like Loki, he learns the truth of the abduction, but his emotional prison may end up leading to a literal one as well.",

To me Prisoners is underrated and has his spot among classics like Seven and Silence Of The Lambs. The acting is outstanding in Prisoners. You can feel the desperation dripping of Hugh Jackman. The detective Loki played by Jake Gyllenhaal is also a delight to watch. In fact the whole cast did an outstanding job.

            "content": "Prisoners is a film that will haunt me for a while. The story is so well constructed in not your A-Z form. There's a very realistic approach to it's unhurried plot, and how it quickly unfolds in the helplessness of the two dads, friends whose little girls have been snatched, supposedly by a faceless guy, couple, loitering around the area in an suspicious RV, in the cold frosty air. This is one of many films built around the child napping scenario, the disturbing type ones, that have run more common thing in the last couple of years (Taken, The Flock) this one never more effective, though these aren't teenagers, they're kids. Prisoners works, not just because of the A level performances, some so bloody convincing, but the realistic standpoint of the characters in how they deal with the situations. We so much feel helplessness with the driven father Jackson, who resorts to kidnapping and torturing a mum, childlike suspect, you want him so much to talk, where at one point, you realize it's gonna be like getting blood out of a stone, the girl's fates, waning, or may'be already determined. Jackson does get bloody here, mind you, while his mate, not an advocate, is reversely the opposite. \"Christ, your little girl's been snatched man\", but the reverse contrast in these two characters works. At one point, as Jackman's \"Where's my daughter\", reaches a shouting pinnacle, this just reminds us of what a great dramatic actor he is. But Gylenhall, is just fantastic, as the driven cop, carving another notch under his acting belt. He brings some truly unnerving moments to his character, that you don't when he'll pop his top next. There are some sick themes to the film too, (the snakes in those containers) in a film that touches on a disturbing subject. Playing out to nearly two and a half hours, Prisoners is a rewarding experience to the movie goer, though on the other hand, you may have to allow the effect and memory of this movie to dissipate days after the view. Just cautioning some here.",

            "content": "\"Grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and wisdom to know the difference. Amen.\" - Reinhold NiebuhrDennis Villeneuve directs \"Prisoners\". The film opens on Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman), a tough survivalist who recounts the Lord's prayer whilst hunting for deer. \"Your kingdom come, your will be done,\" he murmurs, before watching as a bullet kills his prey.Villeneuve quickly sketches Dover as a conservative Christian, survivalist, carpenter and master of his own fate. Dover hates relinquishing control, hates waiting and, more importantly, likes to take matters into his own hands. Villeneuve then clashes Dover's obstinacy with the song \"Man from Galilee\", a Christian hymn about a man with \"sightless eyes\" who doesn't \"trust in God\", who refuses to wait for God's \"will to be done\", and who refuses to \"cry for help\". Dover's first name, Keller, itself recalls Helen Keller, famously deaf and blind. Dover will eventually be revealed to be similarly deaf and blind. Early in \"Prisoners\", Dover's daughter Anna is abducted. Joy, his neighbour's daughter, is similarly missing. Both are the victims of Holly (Melissa Leo), a serial killers who has abducted over sixteen kids. Why? After the death of her son, Holly came to blame Christ for ruining her life. Wishing to spread misery, she thus kidnaps, drugs and kills the kids of devout believers. She aims to instigate existential crises and a total disbelief in God. Dover, of course, believes in God wholeheartedly, but doesn't ACT as though he does. Developing this theme is a subplot in which Jake Gyllenhaal plays Loki, the detective tasked with finding the two missing girls. Trusting his own private hands and his own narrow perspective, Dover refuses to have faith in Loki. Significantly, Loki is named after the Norse God of mischief and chaos, and has crucifixes tattooed to his knuckles. He's perhaps emblematic of a \"higher\", \"mysterious\" order, and perhaps also a natural \"disorder\", which the blustery, knuckle-headed Dover refuses to rely or call upon. \"Prisoners\" ends with several revelations. A man found dead under the basement of a priest is revealed to be Holly's husband, a pair of young suspects (Bob Taylor and Alex Jones) are revealed to be victims of Holly, and references to mazes prove to be allusions to methods used by Holly to psychologically torture her victims. More importantly, it is revealed that had Loki or Dover done absolutely nothing throughout the film, Joy would have escaped and revealed the identity of her kidnappers anyway. Whether this is \"God's plan\" or \"sheer coincidence\" is left up to the viewer, though the film does suggest that it views Dover's neighbours, the Birches (steadfast like hardwood birch?), as \"true Christians\". Joy escapes, in a sense, because her parents are unwavering in their faith. Alternatively, Joy's escape represents a sense of randomness or sheer capriciousness which the militant Dover refuses to acknowledge.Regardless, Villeneuve packs his film with odd bits of symbolism. Loki's constant blinking, for example, echoes the blinking flashlight which illuminates a priest's cellar and also Dover's sputtering flashlight, which reveals both a \"cellar\" and the \"rape whistle\" he once gave daughter Anna. Elsewhere both Holly's husband (also a serial killer) and Dover find themselves trapped underground and judged for their sins, but only Dover repents and escapes; he symbolically blows an emergency whistle, crying for help and so finally relinquishing control to a higher authority. \"Prisoners\" is handsomely directed by Dennis Villeneuve. The film is immaculately lit, beautifully framed, engrossing, but also unintentionally silly in places (Why would Holly let two of her victims roam free?). The film's middle act contains an extended sequence in which Dover captures and tortures a young man whom he believes to be his daughter's kidnapper, a subplot about belief which is too quickly dropped and which never convincingly seeps into or impacts the rest of the film's drama.Interestingly, without this subplot, the film's philosophical point would have been exposed as a sham: Dover is absolutely right to do anything he can to find Anna, we only chastise him because he descends into criminality. In most situations, it is silly to bow in the face of a supposed \"higher power\", be it God or indeterminism. The film preaches passivity, inaction and faith (in God or destiny), a stance which relies upon a very specific straw-man: the belief that the opposite is irrational, dangerous or immoral.Beyond this, the film's aesthetic recalls \"Seven\" and Joon-ho Bong's \"Memories of Murder\". It's themes recall \"The Pledge\", Dumont's \"Humanite\" and \"X-Files: I Want To Believe\", all more substantial crime films which touch upon similar themes. It's climax resembles \"Spoorloos\", also with burials and daughters kidnapped. As comparison, see \"The Next Three Days\" and \"The Limits of Controll\", the former about a man who successfully wrestles control away from \"God\". 7.5/10 \u2013 Worth one viewing.",

Superman, Avatar, etc.The 2nd type is set in the real world. Sure it's fiction and I understand that to make this type of movie interesting you have to compound coincidences that wouldn't likely all happen in real life. This type of movie, however doesn't get a free pass on the impossible, just on unlikely.So here we have a modern setting in suburban small town New York state where 2 girls go missing. So the entertainment value here is watching how people interact and cope with the situation. Here's a few of the things that's hopelessly unreal: Cops don't go to possible dangerous places alone. Instead they call the SWAT team, or call for backup or at least have a partner.Alex Jones, the kidnapped suspect can do a 10 hour interview with Detective Loki, but can endure days of torture before he says anything to Keller Dover, the crazy father torturer. Doesn't make sense since he's hot the bad guy.Franklin and Nancy Birch, totally unbelievable. Franklin is led to the torture chamber and voices his disbelief several times before joining in. Franklin tells his wife who doesn't call the cops, no she goes to the torture chamber, tells the other 2 how bad they are and they co-operates with them.Bob Taylor, another traumatized grown up child victim, acts normal, holds down a job, but collects clothes from current victims, puts blood on them and stores them in locked boxes full of snakes on his property.So all we have is a story that is not just improbable, but impossible, scene after scene. Much more believable is Obi Wan Ken-obi getting a free pass by wiggling his fingers and saying, \"these aren't the Droids you're looking for.\" That was entertaining.

            "content": "Prisoners are quite possibly one of the greatest mystery/thrillers to hit our screens in decades which this film nearing its 10th anniversary next year its in my eyes an instant classic up there with films like seven, pulp fiction and silence of the lambs which are all three of my favourite crime thriller type films of all time.What this film does so well at is creating such a bleak and quite a gloomy environment around the characters using beautiful cinematography and weather and the overall mood of our characters, I suppose it's extremely realistic in the angle of capturing stages of grief and rage abd desperation that's what this film portrays for me.Id says this is Hugh Jackman best ever role in his entire career yes that includes Wolverine, the way jackman captures tbis man's grief and anger mixed with fear was just out of this world which him going down this reckless and dangerous path to get his daughter home was just outstanding, and the things he does in the progress which just made my stomach turn and that, not just the violence and torture he took part in it was his emotional display which is completely shown in the 'hammer' scene which is maybe one of my favourite scenes ever put to a modern film.The supporting and main cast was as good as jackman with jake Gyllenhaal as detective loki trying all in his power to uncover this sick mystery.With some explosive and borderline chilling scenes.What makes this film As stellar as it is, is the element of not knowing what twist or turns we are gonna see and with the perfect twist at the end of the film which tied the film together beautifully, then not forgetting to mention the most aggravating ending I have seen and that's a positive.Prisoners are cold, depressing, and ugly which makes it the perfect mystery-thriller which adds everything you could seek from a film of this magnitude because it uses its two hours and a half-run time perfectly!",

Cinematography, genius Deakins success to build the tense of the film only by his work. Film atmosphere was really good. The Bad: Overlong and the original score not pretty good to lived up the film. I mean, Johann was a really good composer, especially his work in Sicario and Arrival, but it's not work here. Conclusion: Many good aspects of the film, but its just good, not amazing.",

First and foremost the cinematography by Roger Deakins is flawless. It perfectly sets the tone for the film. Particularly the shots which utilise the weather to create stunning effects with lighting and shadows. This is a a long film. The runtime is around 2hrs and 30mins. Although the pacing is perfect. As soon as the film begins, each scene builds and builds with more intensity. Prisoners kept me 100% hooked with intense suspense throughout the entire investigation. Furthermore, the performances are all incredible. Hugh Jackman's character contains such powerful emotion, and he delivers it perfectly. Paul Dano also does such a great job with a highly difficult performance. Each actor disappeared in their roles. Particularly Jake Gyllenhaal. The way in which he progressed and grew emotionally, made him so compelling. The score by Johann Johannsson creates feelings of melancholy, sorrow and intensity, during times of horror. Denis' direction accompanied by the incredible screenplay has created such a captivating movie experience. I highly recommend seeing this film. It is one of my favourites of all time, so therefore I give Prisoners a 10.",

And yeah, \"Prisoners\" do have a lot in common with many others in this particular missing people genre, but still it is an enjoyable movie that is entertaining.What makes the movie enjoyable was the amazing performances and great actors and actresses in the movie. Especially Hugh Jackman, I must admit that this is without a doubt his best performance in a movie so far that I have seen. He really gets to show so many aspects of his talent in this movie, proving that he is much more than just an action actor.The storyline in \"Prisoners\" is captivating and interesting, and director Denis Villeneuve manages to keep the audience at the edge of their seats all throughout the entire movie. This is indeed a very emotional roller-coaster, because the characters are so realistic and you quickly bond with them and get to be in their situation. And of course, the amazing portrayal of the characters by the actors and actresses really helped this along quite nicely.There were a couple of plot twists here and there, enough to keep the storyline interesting and pushing the movie in a new direction once in a while. However, the ending to the movie was a bit, well, let's just say that it could have been better.Despite being a rather long movie, then the time passes quickly because the movie is interesting and nicely paced. So the 153 minutes come and go quite fast.\"Prisoners\" is overall an enjoyable and watchable movie. However, it is not the type of movie that you watch more than once, because the story doesn't have a sound enough foundation to support multiple viewings.For fans of Hugh Jackman everywhere, because he really carries the movie quite well.",

The acting is first grade and overall this is a finely crafted movie, the type that will be analyzed for years to come, but at face value it left me confused. The motives behind the two girls disappearing just don't hold any water for me.Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal give strong and believable performances, far removed from their usual blockbuster fare. What baffles me here is this movie being in the IMDb top 250. \"Prisoners\" is a quite good film, but a top 250? Not in my book. Other, far more influential films are NOT on that list, so I'll have to wonder what makes most IMDb users tick.Anyway, \"Prisoners\" is not for everyone, it builds slowly and ends in a very disjointed way.

            "content": "Narrative that follows the 'whodunnit' approach often relies on the climactic twist. Herein lies the craftsmanship of the filmmaker to keep you on the edge even if there is nothing but a simple conversation is going on the screen. You can feel the Hitchcockian bomb is there somewhere. David Fincher showed us how to hold the suspense throughout the film in his early works. Dennis Villeneuve here pretty much did a similarly splendid job.Two families see their worlds go upside down, when their two very young daughters go missing, presumably abducted. When the adept detective has to let the primary suspect go, due to lack of evidences, the father of one child takes it to himself to find the daughters. Sounds familiar? Yes, the premise is quite similar to that of a Mystic River or a Zodiac.But, the defining feature of this film would be that, every now and then it justifies its title and asks you question about who the real prisoner is. For it is us who put ourselves in the most impregnable prisons. As we see the father, Keller (Hugh Jackman) shredding his values one by one; the obsession, the pain are felt by the audience.Like mentioned earlier, it is one thing to build a premise that promises suspense; and, I am going a bit Jerry Seinfeld way here, it is a different thing altogether to 'hold' the suspense throughout the film. Credit goes to Aaron Guzikowski for the always-engaging and compelling script. Villeneuve hardly mismatches the pace of the story or loses the grip in the screenplay. Some might disagree, but I think the plot is divided in two sub-plots. One that follows the premise where the detective Loki, played by Jake Gyllenhaal, relentlessly pursues the kidnapper. The other is where Keller is the protagonist; that always makes us wonder how far people can go for the love of family.When you get a cast like the one this film has, you get the chance to explore various ranges of emotion and actually get to build characters, which is not very regular in typical thriller films. The support cast was stellar with the likes of Maria Bello, Terrence Howard, Viola Davies, the astonishingly refrained Melissa Leo and Paul Dano, who not surprisingly revels in his almost-silent, reserved character. Each one of them showing their acting prowess in turns. But, it is the leads that will sweep off your feet with their performances. Both Jackman and Gyllenhaal give knock-out performances as theirs were the more layered characters in the film.The final punch of the film comes from Johann Johannsson's haunting compositions and Roger Deakins' masterful work. Just sets up the grim mood of the film. Deakins' craftsmanship's best moment would be at the end, where he creates magic on screen with the city lights.5/5",

Most tension in this movie comes from it's characters being unable to speak. What's up with that?1.So we got this guy, who obviously has something to do with the kidnapping of the two girls, and as it turns out, he was the one who lured them into the van. It was a sloppy kidnapping, they immediately caught the suspect, but guess what,he can't (?)speak. They said that he is on a level of a ten year old, but he behaves as he is on a level of a three year old, but still, he has a driver license(?). So we then come to all the beating,torturing and all the screaming :'Tell me where are they?' If he said: it took them to my mothers house, the movie is over. So he was so resilient to torture or simply he was to stupid to make a sentence that makes sense. The later makes more sense, but on the other hand, it makes no sense at all.2.Then comes the priest who has a rotten corp in his basement. But he just mumbles. Like he's a 3 year old as well. He isn't able to say any useful information. Who's the dead guy, what's his name , how he came to him (or with whom, with what vehicle etc, etc..) He just can't speak intelligible. 3. Them comes the guy who steals kid's clothing, using pig's blood, hiding it with snakes. He's intelligent enough to recognize a cop, to escape him, to, at the first moment, when the cop shows at his home, fool him by saying '' I've never seen you before''. But when they need to interrogate him, he is suddenly like a 3 year old, drawing and mumbling and drooling like a completely retarded person who's unable to say one sentence that makes sense. So we still don't know anything and the movie goes on.4.Then comes the girl that escaped, she's in the hospital, but of course, she is not able to speak. Or else she would tell us where she was held, and the movie's over.5.And finally , when they rescue the second girl, she doesn't seem to speak as well. Or else she would tell them about hidden basement in the yard with entrance hidden under the old car. But no...So somewhere around 80 min into the movie , I had enough. I know that they wanted that exciting, disturbing thriller, exploring moral bipolarity of every human, dark (metaphorically and literally with all the rain and pale colors). But for me this was to much and last 30 minutes was like a torture.",

            "content": "The best way to see \"Prisoners\" is to go in cold, not knowing anything, and be surprised and excited by every new twist and turn. I knew very little and had moderate expectations, so that when the early event \u2013 every parent's worst nightmare, the kidnapping of children \u2013 occurs I was seized by dread and anxiety which didn't let up until the final moment in the film. I see too many movies that don't really engage me, so it was thrilling to watch a movie that so completely held me in thrall.Jake Gyllenhaal plays the cop assigned to the case. He's intuitive and methodical and has a history of solving all his cases. It doesn't help, though, that the father (played by Hugh Jackman) of one of the little kidnapped girls, impatient with the cop's M.O., decides to take matters into his own hands. He's a good man who does something unspeakably bad, and what he ends up doing morally rips him apart. This turns the movie from being merely a police procedural into something altogether different, and makes it really interesting. There are monsters in the movie \u2013 and in the world \u2013 and they're not the big bad wolf living off in the woods, somewhere. Sometimes they live among us, in nice tidy little houses down the street \u2013 or maybe they lurk inside us.I was afraid that the story was going to be too convoluted and that there were going to be gaps in logic (it's a testament to how involved I was in the movie that, for awhile, I was on edge about this) but these were tidied up to my satisfaction. One critic I read thought the movie was way too long, but I wasn't bored for an instant. \"Prisoners\" is exactly as long as it needs to be. I liked director Denis Villeneuve's careful and methodical pacing, slow and suggestive fades and preoccupation with mood (all of which, for me, increased the suspense). There were moments when this movie messed with my head.",

Hugh Jackman and Terrence Howard play two fathers who get together with their wives but their youngest girls go missing. A suspect is brought in but he has the mentality of a ten year old. When the suspect is released Jackman abducts him and locks him in an abandon building where he brutally tortures him for the whereabouts of the girls. Director Denis Villeneuve previously made the underrated Maelstrom and here treads delicately with the idea of a possible innocent person being tortured as guilty. There is several effective plot turns that provides tension as well as aim the viewer's expectations in other directions. Jackman delivers one of his greatest performances as a father struggling with his faith as well as his role of father. Howard plays the best friend who struggles to fathom his friend's illegal choice of justice. Jake Gyllenhaal is great as a cop dealing with possible failure and dealing with the emotional elements of the job. Paul Dano steals scenes as the target suspect unresponsive to the brutality. Maria Bello plays Jackman's wife whose hopes are drifting into despair and his absence doesn't help. Strong theme of family, fatherhood and trying maintain your faith in the face of God.

Directed by the incredible Denis Villeneuve who's responsible for churning out some of the most must see movies I have enjoyed in the past 7 years this one is really a winner.So the main plot of this cerebral story centers around the disappearance of two little girls. The daughter's of Hugh Jackman and Terrence Howards' characters respectively. Every parents worst nightmare really. Its the lengths that these two men are willing to go to find their missing daughters that really drives this story. Along the way unexpected things happen and you just get dragged deeper and deeper into the mystery. The clues are laid out quite well though. Like Zodiac (another fantastic Gyllenhaal movie) its well plotted and paced and keeps you guessing until the end. Certainly the agony and suffering of worrying about missing children is well portrayed here as if it were unfolding in real life.Its really a no nonsense type of movie, no laughs, no smiles.

Though the film is quite long (153 minutes) the tension is sustained making the viewer not so much an observer but a member of this funky little cold town where so much evil happens.The time is the present (the location shooting was Georgia but any small town across the country could well substitute), it is Thanksgiving and two close families are gathered in their neighborhood for the feast; the Dovers \u2013 father Keller (Hugh Jackman, mother Grace (Maria Bello), daughter Anna (Erin Gerasimovich) and son Ralph (Dylan Minnette) and the Birches \u2013 father Franklin (Terrence Howard), mother Nancy (Viola Davis), daughters Eliza (Zoe Borde) and Joy (Kyla Drew Simmons). Joy and Anna disappear and panic strikes. The only lead is a dilapidated RV that had earlier been parked on their street. Heading the investigation, Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) arrests its driver, Alex Jones (Paul Dano), but a lack of evidence forces his release. As the police pursue multiple leads and pressure mounts, knowing his child's life is at stake the frantic Keller Dover decides he has no choice but to take matters into his own hands. His methods involve capturing and torturing Alex with Franklin's help, but neither is sure of the outcome of their interrogation. Twists and turns occur involving a drunken sicko priest (Len Cariou) and the aunt/mother of Alex (Melissa Leo) \u2013 both leading to very surprising endings.The cast is as first rate as they come. Everyone is strong by Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal are brilliant. Viola Davis, Melissa Leo, and Maria Bello involve with their usual excellent acting abilities.

            "content": "\"Prisoners\" 2013 Fine Performances, Evocative Direction, Screwball Script I wanted to see \"Prisoners\" after I saw the trailer. Alas, the trailer contains all the best parts of the movie. Suburban parents celebrating Thanksgiving slowly come to realize that their two daughters are missing. The trailer featured quiet, dark scenes of increasing menace and despair, shot in realistic, autumnal, suburban settings. The trailer promised big, big stars: Hugh Jackman and Maria Bello as one set of parents and Viola Davis and Terence Howard as the other, Jake Gyllenhaal as the police detective, Paul Dano as the suspect and Melissa Leo as the suspect's adoptive parent. The trailer promised an intelligent thriller that would interrogate how far an ethical person could go in attempting to rescue his daughter from an abductor. The trailer also seemed to suggest an examination of how law enforcement responds, for better or worse, in child abduction cases. The first twenty minutes of \"Prisoners\" delivered what I'd hoped for based on the trailer, but I was hyper-aware that I was watching scene after scene I'd already seen in the trailer. Around the time that an unlikely body was found in an unlikely spot, and a fist met a face several times more than was necessary to make any point, but certainly enough times to satisfy a film-goer's sick, sadistic bloodlust, the movie went off the rails for me, abandoned all its seriousness and intelligence, and became sensational gore and commercial pap. I was so let down I wanted to leave the theater, but I stayed because I'd roped two friends into seeing this with me. \"Prisoners\" is a whodunit so there's a limit to what I can say without revealing any spoilers. I can say this. Jake Gyllenhaal powerfully performs a dedicated police detective. Hugh Jackman exercises his neck veins a lot, and his American accent is wobbly but okay. Terence Howard, Viola Davis, and Maria Bello are given criminally little to do. Viola Davis has one of the most interesting scenes in the movie. This scene is only a minute or two long and it is not developed at all. That is a shame because the scene is the moral crux of the film. And the film does nothing with it; the filmmakers went with implausible sensationalism and sadism rather than substance. Paul Dano, as the suspect, and Melissa Leo, as his adoptive mother, both give powerhouse performances in very challenging roles. Denis Villeneuve's direction is flawless. He avoids explosive stunts and theatrics with his camera. His moves are slow and quiet, even while filming ugly violence. I'd like to see his work on a better script. There are many attempts to make the movie deeper than it is. There are many scenes initially shot through dirty glass. \"Through a glass darkly\" is a line from the Bible. Ooo big symbolism. Wow. There are many crosses, including one hanging from the rearview mirror in Keller \u2013 Hugh Jackman's \u2013 truck. Wow. Heavy. I just may think something \u0085 no, I'd rather watch snakes. Oh, yes. There are snakes. Some understand Satan as taking snake form in Genesis. Heavy. Profound! Yeah, not really. Just bizarrely implausible. There are strange character names. Hugh Jackman's first name is \"Keller\" which brings to mind the blind and deaf Helen Keller, or maybe the word \"Killer.\" Jake Gyllenhaal is Detective Loki. Loki is the trickster God of Norse mythology. This is all pretty high school. There are two scenes and one character treatment in this film that I found completely implausible. The two scenes are essential to the plot. I can't describe these two scenes but I can say that one is utterly implausible because of surveillance. The action of the film takes place within hours and days of a child abduction. Not only police, but also media and neighbors would be keeping an eagle eye on all suspects. Another scene is implausible because it demands that we forget everything we've been told about a key character. One character treatment is unbelievable to me because a very unlikely character is depicted as being as heroic, in his way, as John McCain. Not plausible. I also found the final resolution of the crime to be something that would only occur in a writer's imagination, and the ending to be pointlessly cute. Again, the opening scenes of the dawning awareness that a child has been abducted are powerful, but the film totally lost me with its comic book sensationalism, sadism, and \u2013 I have to say it \u2013 stupidity.",

            "content": "'PRISONERS': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal star in this crime thriller about a father obsessed with finding his kidnapped daughter. The film co-stars Terrence Howard, Paul Dano, Melissa Leo, Viola Davis and Maria Bello. It was written by Aaron Guzikowski and directed by critically acclaimed (and award winning) Canadian director Denis Villeneuve. Mark Wahlberg (who was originally set to star in the film) produced it (he also starred in the 2012 Guzikowski penned crime thriller 'CONTRABAND'). The movie is about as intense and emotionally involving as crime dramas get and it's filled with stellar performances. It was just a tad too disturbing for me (at the time of the viewing) but worth it. Jackman stars as Keller Dover in the film. Keller is a religious family man with a wife, Grace (Bello), teenage son, Ralph (Dylan Minnette) and six-year-old daughter Anna (Erin Gerasimovich). As the movie opens his family visits their neighbors, Franklin (Howard) and Nancy Birch (Davis) and their two daughters Eliza (Zoe Borde) and Joy (Kyla Drew Simmons), for Thanksgiving dinner. The two six-year-old daughters run home to the Dover's house to retrieve Anna's security whistle and never return. Ralph and Eliza saw their younger siblings playing on an RV parked down the street earlier that afternoon and tell their parents this (they also noticed someone was inside it). The RV is no longer there when Keller and Franklin go looking for it. The police are alerted and Detective Loki (Gyllenhaal) is put on the case. They locate the RV but the kids aren't inside it and the man driving it, Alex (Dano), is mentally retarded with the IQ of a ten-year-old. Alex is arrested but later released (as Loki pursues other leads) but Keller is sure that Alex knows where his daughter is and will stop at nothing to get the information out of him. Gyllenhaal has been one of my favorite actors for several years (ever since films like 'DONNIE DARKO' in 2001 and 'MOONLIGHT MILE' in 2002). He gives one of his best performances to date here; as a cop almost as obsessed with saving the kids as Jackman's father character is. It's Jackman that gives the best performance of his career here though (I believe). He's so emotional and convincing that he should definitely see at least an Oscar nomination come awards time (so should Gyllenhaal though). The rest of the cast is all more than adequate as well but it's not just the acting that makes the movie work so well. The script is gut wrenchingly suspenseful and fast paced and the directing is equally as intense. The movie kicks into high gear once the kids are kidnapped and never really lets up until the credits roll. It's disturbing, heart breaking and very hard to watch (and I've seen a few too many of these types of films lately) but it's definitely worth it. A grade A crime thriller all around!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQkUJbRVsoM",

            "review_title": "Daddy's Gone A-Hunting",
            "content": "This film is highly recommended. Emotions always run high whenever a child is in peril. For years, the hostage drama has been a successful staple in the crime drama genre. Films dealing with child abduction have been a mixed lot, from the sublime (Mystic River, Gone Baby Gone) to the good (Raising Arizona, The Changeling), from the mediocre (Ransom, Man on Fire) to the ridiculous (Taken, Labyrinth, Bunny Lake is Missing). Denis Villeneuve's Prisoners belongs in that upper echelon of superior dramas. The film begins as a standard emotional melodrama about the aftermath of a child kidnapping before veering into a gripping story of vengeance and vigilantism. This is a film where bigger issues come into play. It doesn't play safe by being just a well-meaning routine crime drama. Instead, the filmmakers would rather deal with the gut-wrenching consequences done by flawed individuals and the backlash caused by revenge and retaliation in the name of justice.Over Thanksgiving dinner, two children go missing. An investigation ensues, leading one detective to a possible suspect, a mentally challenged loner who was near the scene of the crime. But with little evidence to hold him and time running out, a father decides to intervene and takes matters into his own hands.Hugh Jackman plays that father, Keller Dover, a devout Christian, an everyman who loves and protects his family at any cost. Jackman has some dark and sadistic scenes to play and his emotional range as the conflicted dad is beyond riveting. Jake Gyllenhaal plays Loki, the lead detective on the case and the actor delivers a multi-layered performance as an obsessed investigator in search of answers. Maria Bello is Keller's distraught and supportive wife, Grace. Terence Howard and Viola Davis are the other couple who are swept into this crisis and all of three actors are at the top of their game. Playing the primary suspect is Paul Dano, whose expertise in creating creepy characters comes in quite handy, along with Melissa Leo as his quirky and loyal mother.Villeneuve's direction is lean and concise. He shows some disturbing graphic imagery to incite the necessary rationale to make the audience possibly justify the acts of violence throughout the film while debating ethical questions about the brutality: When do the ends justify the means? At what price does one trade their moral conscience for justice? How far can one desperate act go to surpass another? (Warning: This is not a film for the easily squeamish or overly sensitive film-goer.)From the start, Prisoners captures the moviegoer's attention and never lets go. It is a tension- filled mystery with some surprising twists amid the moral dilemmas. The film is thoroughly engrossing due to a literate and perspective script by Aaron Guzikowski which takes its time to build characters and flesh out its plot. Add to that, some terrific acting from an outstanding ensemble, Villeneuve's solid direction, and you have one of the best films of the year. (My only reservation is a deliberately ambiguous ending that tends to mar the film's overall impact.)Prisoners works on so many varied levels: as an intense crime thriller about child abduction, an emotional melodrama about a family in crisis, or as a dark parable about the violent world we live in. See Prisoners for any of those reasons, but by all means, make sure you see this film. GRADE: B+ANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",

Movie.First of all, it dragged on foooorrrreeevvvveeerrrrr. It felt like I was sitting there for 5 hours. Yes it was enjoyable to try and guess whodunnit but I am so angry about the ending that it ruined the rest of it for me.Obviously I won't spoil it for anyone but be warned IT CUTS OFF! You sit through all of that, they don't show outcomes of a few characters, and you're waiting for your happy ending closure and then BAM! Credits. I can't believe I wasted that much time when I could have knocked at least 2 other movies off my list that night. Nothing, I repeat NOTHING makes me angrier than a movie with no closure. It's designed so that you can assume what happens but screw that, if I have to sit there and go through all that stuff just to leave it up to my imagination what happens in the end it's automatically failed. My other pet peeve is that Jake Gyllenhaal was a terrible cop. Not that his acting was bad, but his character itself was retarded. He was ALWAYS alone, never followed protocol, never let anyone know where he was and that is just bad writing. The only reason I didn't give it 1 star is because I've seen worse.If you are like me and need closure and answers, DO NOT waste your time on this movie.",

            "content": "For his English language debut French/Canadian director Denis Villeneuve (maker of the under-seen and highly recommended Incendies) has crafted a dread laden, beautifully made thriller that shows his now Hollywood counterparts a thing or to about how to create a white knuckle believable tale of crime, loss, love and how far parental instincts will go to protect those they love. Without a doubt Prisoners is one of this year's most fully formed, well-acted and involving movies.The tale Prisoners tells is one that deserves to be kept to a pre-knowledge minimal, all that needs to be known is Jackman's Keller will stop at nothing to find his missing daughter going as far to kidnap the man he believes knows about her whereabouts in the form of the ever great and creepy Paul Dano as mentally handicapped Alex. This particular action is counteracted with Gyllenhaal's Detective Loki, a man who has never not solved a case and runs into increasingly scary and mysterious possibilities of what may have happened to the girls and who may have done it. The story written by Aaron Guzikowski is a tight and taut example of how to play out an investigation procedural movie and by the films end you feel well and truly like you yourself have endured as much as the characters themselves.Prisoners would not be half the story it is on final presentation without the absolutely top tier Oscar worthy work of its main players, with particular praise going to both Jackman and Gyllenhaal who perhaps arguably give career best turns here. Never before on screen has Jackman seemed so dangerous and volatile (yes even more so than his famed mutant) and Gyllenhaal aces his role as Loki, a loner with clear OCD mannerisms but a detective you would want working on your case. Other aspects that make Prisoners such a pleasure is Villeneuve's stout direction, Johaan Johannsson's hauntingly constructed and well used score and I was wondering why the film was just so darn beautiful when it shouldn't of been then I read during the credits cinematography great Roger Deakins was at the helm therefore giving Prisoners an aesthetic that is again one of the year's best.With so many films this year disappointing and missing the mark ever so slightly it's a breath of fresh air to witness a film as complete as Prisoners is. While not an enjoyable experience perse due to its unquestionable bleak tone and subject matter it is a must see movie event and (in my opinion the following is high praise indeed) \u2013 the best movie of its type since Zodiac, a film it mirrors in many ways and a film in which it can sit proudly equal to.4 and a half red whistles out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check out - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",

Compared to Christian Bale's Batman and Toby Maguire's Spider-Man Jackman's Wolverine is one dimensional, child friendly and as far removed from what Wolverine should be as is possible. It is also unfortunate that Wolverine is his defining role. Why? It is unfortunate because Hugh Jackman is a world class and quite simply phenomenal talent. Granted the physique gained from his preparation for Wolverine aids in his portrayal of a dominant, controlling figure. But nothing should be taken away from him here, he is ferocious in the pursuit of his daughter's captor and I for one believed he would do anything (or more apt anything to anyone) to get his daughter back. His testosterone filled male, physical dominance is akin to Marlon Brando's Stanley Kowalski in A Streetcar Named Desire. In short Jackman is simply stunning to watch. Special mentions should also go to the always fantastic Jake Gyllenhall and Maria Bello but this movie is all about Hugh Jackman and why he has finally found a role that highlights why he deserves his place at the top of Hollywood royalty.",

            "content": "Now, I move on to PRISONERS, directed by Denis Villenueve from a script written by Aaron Guzikowski.I am going to try to keep this review a short one because I know this movie is very dark and serious and can get very disturbing and emotional in a few areas during the 153-minute feature running time. There will be a few spoilers in this review, so if you haven't seen the film, you may want to.PRISONERS just blew me away with it's story. Aaron Guzikowski wrote a screenplay that is just really amazing with great dialogue and a great plot in this film. The story focuses on the abduction of two young girls in Pennsylvania and the police's subsequent search. Keller Dover and his wife Grace attends a Thanksgiving dinner at the home of their neighbors Franklin and Nancy Birch and both families' younger daughters, Anna Dover and Joy Birch goes missing. Detective David Loki arrests and questions the driver of a suspicious vehicle, Alex Jones and Dover attacks Jones after he is released.Loki is doing different cases, but Dover decides to take matters into his own hands and tortures Alex Jones for answers, but he denies that he is Alex Jones and claims that he escaped from a maze. Dover visits Jones' aunt, Holly and she tells that she and her husband were religious until their son died of cancer. Joy Birch is found drugged but alive. Dover visits her in the hospital and Joy tells him \"You were there\".Loki searches for Dover and discovers Jones. Dover goes to the Jones' house to get information, but Holly pulls a gun out on him. She makes him put handcuffs on his hands and drinks some kind of poisoning, but I'll get to that in a minute. She explains that her and her late husband abducted many children as part of their \"war on God\" after their son died. She shoots him in the leg and forces him to get inside a concealed pit and imprisons him in the pit, where he finds a whistle belonging to his daughter.Anna is found with Holly, but Anna is taken to the hospital and Holly is killed. Outside the Jones' house, Loki hears Dover's labored whistling from the pit that he is imprisoned in.I thought the pacing and dialogue was a little confusing, but also really amazing throughout the movie and that is an incredible but hard and challenging thing to pull off, but a lot of movies has done this really great.***SPOILER ALERT!*** Like I said in the plot, Dover is imprisoned by Holly and this was the main issue I had with the film. Because for two reasons: \u0095 1. She imprisons him in a concealed pit, makes him drink some kind of poison. I don't know what it is, but it's all black. She makes him put handcuffs on his hands and shoots him in the leg, forcing him to get inside the pit. I think this could have been done better with music in the scene at least.\u0095 2. The ending was a little confusing and I only watched this movie once, but I think the end is there just to set up a sequel.The acting is just amazing. Hugh Jackman deserves a lot of credit for his performance as Keller Dover. Jake Gyllenhaal plays Detective Loki wonderfully. Terrence Howard, Viola Davis and Maria Bello are all great in this film. Paul Dano plays Alex Jones and he is great in the part that he had to play and he was an amazing casting choice for the film.The only performance that I had trouble with was Academy Award winner Melissa Leo's character, Holly Jones. She had to wear make-up for the part, but she is just scary as heck in the part that she plays and what she did to Hugh Jackman's character did not seemed like a very good idea at all.This is the reason why this film appeared on my Top 10 Overrated Movies list is because of the ending, which I just mentioned. This movie really deserved the Oscar for Best Cinematography and Best Picture, but the Academy only chooses great movies.PRISONERS is a great film, and I will forever be angry that this did not win an Academy Award, but Frozen wins two Oscars? That is just crazy! This film was originally rated NC-17 for \"substantial disturbing violent content and explicit images\", but was re-edited to secure the R rating for \"disturbing violent content include torture and language throughout\". I am so glad that this got the R rating because I would not have been able to watch this film if it was NC-17.The music is just amazing. The cinematography, editing, production and costume designs are just amazing.Overall, I love PRISONERS. Even though the ending got on my nerves a little bit, I still love what this movie does and what it shows. This is one crime - drama / mystery - suspense thriller that I don't think gets enough credit.My rating is going to be the rating of 10 out of 10. It's a perfect movie and you should see it. Sure, it is graphic, disturbing, emotional and violent in some areas, but if you can look past some of that, you may be able to find one great drama that will satisfy you.PRISONERS is a great film that will blow you away and the performances of Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Melissa Leo, Maria Bello, Viola Davis, Terrence Howard and Paul Dano in this film will certainly blow you away from beginning to end and you will not be able to take your eyes off your television screen from start to finish once this movie begins and once it ends after 2 hours.",

So amazingly thought out, everything fits into place from the beginning to the end. It starts of calm and peaceful and soon after descends into complete chaos. I found myself in tears half the time and the other half I was on the edge of my seat. The movie clearly shows how far people will go to protect their loved ones and what they will do to achieve this. If you wait till the end the payoff is huge, it is so incredibly put together, like a puzzle, and in the end has such a strong impact.

There is a lack of satisfaction and resolution, with many of the key moments actually not being shown (thanks random Redditor). So if you're watching this film don't expect EVERYTHING to be nicely tied up.A couple of other issues are the Police Captain is a stereotypical a hole who's horrible at their job. The cops actually are ridiculously incompetent thought this whole film. Also Melissa Leo playing the Aunt Holly has had a bad makeup job and doesn't look real.Besides that not a bad film to watch, but it's not one I'll watch again and not one I would have been sad to miss.",

            "content": "The title of Denis Villeneuve's Prisoners obviously refers to the two abducted little girls. More significantly, the other major characters are themselves imprisoned by their own weakness/strength, especially their righteousness. Their faith in their own vision makes them morally weak and dangerous.In a Georgia city a professional, black family, the Birches, have befriended the less comfortable family of the construction worker Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman). This is Obama's America, where the old race lines have been altered. The John Birch society has given way to the affluent and accepted Franklin Birch family. But when the Birches, who know better, go along with the white man's sadistic schemes even the new liberal couple are morally compromised. The older Jones couple used to be evangelists until their son's death by cancer cast them from believers into -- not disbelievers, but killers waging war against God. You have to believe in God to wage war against Him; you just believe in your own vision more. By abducting and killing children they intend to drive their victims' families away from their faith. The drunken priest Loki interrogates is another fallen believer, an alcoholic sex predator who killed the ex-evangelist to prevent his taking other children. That is, all the religious characters have become vigilantes, killing under the authority of their own judgment. Dover seems Loki's opposite in temperament, a devoted family man who raises his son to kill deer. He prays before killing, to put his evil in God's service. He hangs crosses and plays Christian radio in his car. But his temper and violence are most unChristian, especially when he unleashes them upon the pathetic man Alex Jones (Paul Dano) with his 10-year-old's mind. But Loki discovers he is more like Dover than he realized. He erupts at his suspect, enabling him to grab his revolver and kill himself. Both men's violence imperils the little girls' survival, not to mention their own soul -- and legal standing. Like the religious figures with their sense of mission, Dover is driven by his righteousness. He has absolute confidence in his intuition. That's how he justifies torturing the helpless Jones . When Loki's violence erupts he also shows Dover's dependence upon intuition, which proves wrong. Thinking he is heading off Dover, Loki races to Dover's father's ruined apartment, where he finds the imprisoned Jones. But Dover has discovered Holly Jones's (Melissa Leo) guilt and has sped there instead. Both men's righteousness imperils their cause and proves unjust and disastrous. The case is solved despite -- not because of -- the two central male characters' different confidence in their respective visions. The mazes relate to the righteousness theme because they promise a path, however tortuous, that will lead either in to the center or out to freedom. But the maze on the corpse's medallion offers no successful path. To get to the center you have to ignore the path -- that is, logic, law, social system, ethical imperatives -- and just leap to the center. That's the emblem of the righteous. They don't need to go through or to respect ordinary processes. They have their inner vision and they know they are right. Here that's the route to disaster -- something like the Tea Party \"hearing the people\" and shutting down the government, as it happens. (Remember, this is Obama's America.) As the maze drawings resemble the snake drawings the cases of snakes evoke the shallow righteousness that cost man Eden. In respect for the maze there are two (obligatory) car chases but the only crash is the van in the forest. For more see www.yacowar.blogspot.com.",

Canadian director Denis Villeneuve had been making films for years, but probably achieved his biggest success with \"Incendies\" (2010), getting recognized by the Academy for a foreign film. This was his followup, a much more commercial venture, and probably even more widely seen. Somehow, despite the great performances from Jake Gyllenhaal and Jackman, the only nomination it got was for Roger Deakins' cinematography (which is a given -- as of 2015, he has had 12 nominations).Christopher Orr wrote, \"Ethical exploration or exploitation? In the end, I come down reservedly on the former side: the work done here by Jackman, Gyllenhaal, and especially Villeneuve is simply too powerful to ignore.\" He does raise a good point, however, about the thin line. The violence is intense, and understandably earned the film an NC-17. But is it justified to show this level of violence in order to explain the characters? Perhaps.",

But in a deeper level it plays on things inside us that we become prisoners of. It could be fear, or the need for revenge, or just how we look at others in the world. It is a deep and involving movie, but some parts are hard to watch.It starts with a typical suburban family walking a few houses down the street to visit another family. After a while the two small girls ask permission to go back and get something, but they don't return. Then a frantic search fails to find them.About the same time the teenagers had noticed an old RV parked on the street nearby, and now it was gone. Everyone suspected the person in the RV had taken the girls, so they search for him.Hugh Jackman is Keller Dover and Terrence Howard is the neighbor Franklin Birch. The two girls taken are their young daughters, and the two of them get involved in the search, at times a bit violently. The mothers are Viola Davis as Nancy Birch and Maria Bello as Grace Dover.The main investigator is Jake Gyllenhaal as Detective Loki. He goes about systematically doing his job, but is badgered by Keller who thinks he should crack down on the RV driver.Paul Dano is good as the RV driver, Alex Jones.SPOILERS: When Alex is found at a rest stop, for some reason he panics and crashes into some trees and is caught. But questioning him turns up nothing and he is released. Keller doesn't take this well, convinced that Alex is guilty he abducts him and imprisons him in a dilapidated building Keller owns. He tortures him in an attempt to get him to reveal the location of the two girls. In the end they are found held captive by a woman who over the years had taken and eventually killed a number of children. As the movie ends Keller is seen in the building where Alex is still being held, but the cops arrive and we sense Keller will have to answer for his lawlessness.",

The music of the movie was good but didn't give the scenes the intense or strengthen it. The acting was excellent by Hugh Jackman who performed the character of the father so well and was a very challenging role that he succeeded in it and by Jake Gyllenhaal who gave a solid performance as the police cop and the rest did a great job. The movie's problem is that it focused more on showing the suffering of the family and especially the father and on the cup trying to understand what's wrong with him doing some silly actions especially when he went to ask Alex in his home as If he would tell him!. The characters of his friend wasn't good and didn't add to the movie neither did his wife.

He executed his role great and I enjoyed watching his character unfold into a sort of madness.The entire cast together was perfect.

            "content": "My first viewing of this film close to its original release made me pretty angry. I felt that the film had cheated me a little, by presenting itself as one thing and delivering something very different. My initial sense of the film was that it would drift into something horrific and exploitative, but Villeneuve muddied things by bringing what I thought was a rather crass morality to bear on the second half of the film. By the time we are confronted with the true sadist of the film, we have been suitably chastised for our vengeful impulses. My overarching sense was that Villeneuve had worked out the ideas behind this film, the politics, at the detriment of either thrills or plausible characterisation.On this reviewing I was more open to the ebbs and flows of the drama. What really shifted on this second viewing was my attention. Whereas in the first film I found myself pinballing between Hugh Jackman's Keller and Paul Dano's Alex Jones. On this viewing I began to see the procedural aspects of the film, as Gyllenhaal's mannered Detective Loki came more sharply into view. As a representative of the law Loki is far from infallible, frequently prone to rash errors of judgement and is nonetheless dedicated enough to a code and ethics that he manages to ultimately rescue all those who can be saved. His is an obsessive pragmatism and close attention to deducible facts, as opposed to Jackman's rash torture-as-solution/vengeance approach. What gives PRISONERS ending a bit more intrigue on this second viewing is the way in which it is Detective Loki who fully registers the horror of the belief system that has been grafted on and around the sadism of the film's villainous character. Without the Detective's more balanced approach to the justice, then Melissa Leo's Holly Jones' has won, as her aim seems to be that of the purest evil, to corrupt any potential or capacity for good within a person. This is powerful, sombre, desperately depressing stuff, but I still wish it wasn't such awkward medicine to swallow. Villeneuve would go on to finesse his approach with his next film, the masterful exploitation thriller SICARIO - which balanced off the weighty portentousness of this film's moral posturing, with the full-depth experience of moral dislocation that PRISONERS still lacks.",

            "content": "Greetings again from the darkness. This film is one of those goldmines for discussion and debate. Each successive scene begs the viewer to judge the actions of those involved, but even beyond that, the movie is screaming to be picked apart by those of us prone to do so. It's actually the best of both worlds for film lovers ... it challenges us on a personal and moral basis, and also as one who analyzes scripts, acting choices, and filmmaking techniques.Having seen the trailer, I was very much aware of the foundation of the film ... two young girls are kidnapped and, frustrated with the lack of progress by the police, one of the dads seeks his own form of justice. So I couldn't help but cringe with the obvious metaphor opening scene where Hugh Jackman's character (Keller Dover) experiences one of those life-bonding moments with his teenage son Ralph (played by Dylan Minnette). Once past that, the set-up is expertly handled ... two middle class families sharing friendship and Thanksgiving dinner. Keller and his wife Holly (Maria Bello) have two kids: Dylan and their young daughter Anna (Erin Gerasimokovich). Their neighborhood friends Franklin and Nancy are played by Terrence Howard and Viola Davis, who have a teenage daughter Eliza (Zoe Borde) and young daughter Joy (Kyla Drew Simmons). Perfect families and perfect friends shattered by a horrific ordeal when the young girls go missing. The main suspect is a simplistic man-child who drives a ratty RV. Alex Jones is played by Paul Dano in the most uncompromising manner possible.Enter Detective Loki (played by Jake Gyllenhaal). Loki is an odd bird who never lets a case go unsolved. His quirky personality and facial ticks and buttoned-up shirt provide us with enough backstory that we understand his dogged pursuit and need to work alone. As the story unfolds, we are overwhelmed with an abundance of terrific story lines. In fact, there are so many that we feel downright cheated at all the deadends and dropped-cold sub-plots.As a father, I certainly could relate to Keller's relentless, stop-at-nothing pursuit of the first and only lead. Exactly where would I draw the line for my own actions? I can't answer that other than to say that I totally understood his approach. That's not to say I condone such actions, only that I fully empathize. Holly's reaction to the ordeal is to curl up in bed with meds. That too is understandable. Loki's frustration with his own department and the false leads is also understandable. So while each character's actions make sense, the viewer's frustration is palpable, not just because of these things, but in the mis-use of such fine actors as Mr. Howard, Ms. Davis, and Ms. Leo. Jackman, Gyllenhaal and Dano dominate through much different methods, yet we viewers constantly find ourselves wanting to know more about the teenage kids, the priest played by Len Cariou, and of course, the Howard and Davis characters.The film's message is not vague. It's quite clear, even overly obvious. Keller is a survivalist ... the kind of guy who is prepared for any disaster. No matter how prepared one is, the loss of a child will test your morals, faith and inner-strength. What would you do? How far would you go? Is there a line you won't cross to protect your family? Those questions are much simpler until real life forces you to answer.One thing you will quickly notice is just how stunningly beautiful this film is. The credits provide the answer in Director of Cinematographer Roger Deakins, probably the best in the business. French-Canadian Director Denis Villenueve gave us the exceptional Incendies, and while this one has plenty to offer, I believe some fine-tuning with writer Aaron Guzikowski (Contraband) could have elevated this one to Oscar worthy material. So take your friends and be prepared for post-movie discussion. Everyone will have their own thoughts and opinions. That doesn't make this a great movie, but it serves the purpose of getting us to question our faith and beliefs.",

Hugh and Jake are impassioned and calm respectively but equally effective. Hugh has always had intensity and this is no exception. Jake is sympathetically dedicated and carries his role off convincingly. Paul Dano is actually suited to the dim wit. He isn't suited to mainstream roles because of his looks but here he suits the role to a T. Not enough material given to Viola Davis and Terence Howard. Photography is good and they really capture the dreary weather of the area in winter.Now the weaknesses. The direction is lingering for unnecessary details and rushed for vital plot elements. Doesn't link up the clues and hints clearly enough. I concentrated but still was confused. The ending was badly done. Showing so much detail earlier and then short changing at the end by not showing conclusively what happened and instead just hinting at it was a cheap let down.The story - the only thing I thought was good was the slightly feel good end. But the the weaknesses in the plot show clearly how it suffers in comparison to a true story. The fact that Paul Dano's character could hold out through all that isn't believable. It's an ugly story and gut wrenching in parts.Overall this movie has a good cast and is earnestly acted but it doesn't deserve unmitigated praise.

In a few ways, this is really just another thriller; a multitude of shots of people frantically hurrying about, and an antagonist's motivation that comes off as laughable. But there are plenty of movies that put tired cliches to good use, and Prisoners is one of them. In spite of all this, there is a handful of great performances at work, with Jackman in particular portraying a man barely holding on with chilling efficacy. It's not without its share of blemishes, and plays it a bit too safe in its depiction of the subject matter, but Prisoners is a dread-inducing, pure thriller with enough twists and turns to satisfy.",

To the movie's credit, it kept giving me hope that things will be explained later, but sadly, more illogical actions by the main characters dashed my hopes, and by the mid-point, my mind went to 'whatever' mode and stopped caring about the story.Very sloppy police work - 10 hours of interrogation of a mentally-challenged suspect, without once bringing in an expert to try to coax some truth out; In fact, all interrogations are a waste of time (All three suspects) and the police seem to be okay with learning nothing; a detective who is a loner and 'rambo' all crime scenes by himself, and never once discusses the case with anyone else; When following a suspect, he allows a truck to keep honking him instead of moving out of the way to stay undiscovered? Must be a new surveillance method; a captain who acts like a security guard on a fairly high-profile case, never once directing his people on the investigation nor ever seemed to be interested in the case; Cuff a suspect but leaves him right beside the main door while going deeper into the house searching various rooms? In real life, the suspect would try to make a break for it, surely!; Shoot a suspect, and being shot in the process, but wait, a child is hurt, so let's not even check if the suspect is dead or call it in, just drive to a hospital with blood obscuring his view. Great, a car chase wouldn't make sense for the plot, so let's add this to pump up the adrenaline. Stupid!; stop digging because the ground is frozen, really? Urgency is not valued in police work. Anyone who has seen even one episode of CSI will shake head at how poor the investigators are at treating the case and evidence. The search scene shows a rather large police force, yet on a case with multiple suspects and leads, 'lone ranger' goes it alone. Conveniently, all the clues are on the internet because the police couldn't link various cases of missing children to find some common treads in a (supposedly - due to the 'redneck' style police work) small community; DNA tracing and finger printing must be too new to this police department so that the plot can keep going without the disruption from truth or logic. The main suspect's parents 'died in a car accident'? Let's not check his background and his parents' names.Very strange crisis-management/grieving process - one mother resigns to sadness and spends her time in bed medicated; another mother sits at home staring at old photos. Hang on, the children are not known to be dead yet, shouldn't they try to do something? No, it's easier to grief instead of looking. Why is Dover doing all the running around? And, four parents, each seem to do their own thing, unknown to their respective partners, are allowed to carry on. No one wants to 'band' together to discuss how to find their missing children, they just want to rage in their own way. A new family structure? Terrible villains - The priest who knows a dead man is in his basement, but keeps it to himself. Maybe he didn't kill the guy, but a priest is not bound by silence when known crimes are committed (kidnapping and killing children cannot be said to require the vow of silence, surely)...perhaps, he wanted in on the action? But then why let the guy die and then keep the body?; Dover becomes a kidnapper and torturer, in the hope of learning the truth, but he never gives his captive a chance to speak...every time the captive says something, instead of coaxing more out of him, he goes on a yelling rage of 'tell me'...mate, shut the f**K up and listen, maybe he is trying to tell you something. Then he cleverly constructs a box so that he cannot hear what his captive says...this means he only wants to torture the guy and not extract information as the main objective of the exercise; The old auntie seem to be an experienced abductor and child killer, yet wouldn't shoot a man threatening to reveal her true identity...why toy with him when children are her real targets? He is just an obstacle to her pursuits, so shoot him in the head already and throw him into the hole and be done with it...but noooo, we need the last whistle scene to close out the story. She can bound and gag the children when Dover comes to visit, but would lead the detective to the child (With open door no less) instead of getting rid of him before killing the child; and if her real objective is to rage against god by killing children, why keep the children alive for 6 days? Are there 'auspicious' days to kill children that we weren't told in the story? All in all, the movie has enough to keep audiences watching, but their minds must be switched off to accept the story development. Based on the plot alone, there is no reason to watch after the first half an hour. Acting is brilliant when compared to the script and maybe that is the ticket; have a terrible script so that the actors can make use of their talents to keep the audience watching. When I say brilliant, I do not mean good, I just mean it is much better than the script. What a waste of talent on this 'didn't-think-it-through' crime caper.",

            "content": "One more Hollywood recruiter of foreign talents, Canadian Villeneuve (from INCENDIES 2010) submits his Tinseltown debut with a dark drama about a child abduction, congregated by a swathe of bankable thespians and a virtuoso DP Roger Deakins, it was a considerable success both in box office and among critics, although its Oscar prospect will not likely pan out. PRISONERS conventionally chronicles the appalling case with thorough stoicism to supply enormous stretches to the key performers, Jackson and Gyllenhaal are the two leading players, one is a dogged father believes in his own judgment and is pressured to take extreme measures to fish out information of his missing daughter; another is an idiosyncratic cop has to probe into a sordid scenario while his own backstory remains veiled. Through all these years Gyllenhaal has honed up his screen personality substantially and his quirky foibles (the compulsive blinking here) make him more human while Jackman is a tad over-the-top with a more straightforward character development. Bello, as the flip side of Jackson, her post-trauma symptom is being fully destroyed, cannot function anymore, a devastating mother is a piece of cake for her; Howard and Davis pair stand for a more neutral ethnic line here, which one can relate to oneself under the context, but their shortcomings are as glaring as they are ubiquitous. Dano, who takes us aback with another ambivalent career-turn, his make-up in the torture scenes is too surreal for general viewers, theoretically we should feel sympathetic for him, but somehow he manages to diminish this feeling with his look of opaqueness, is he a real retarded victim or a lackey enjoys the gore? It is a moot point where lingers great aftertaste. We cannot leave Melissa Leo behind here since she is the hidden culprit, her reasons for killing aside, her performance does enhance the story's credibility, and although her downfall is ordained, her encounter with Jackson in the ultimate confrontation is gold and only she can emotionally overpower and cramp Wolverine into his redemption into the darkness. Villeneuve proves wonderfully he is a dab hand can handle challenging projects like this, the whole production team is top-notch, Deakins' camera irradiates specifically in the car sequences near the end, alongside the cutthroat editing, a subdued iridescence can never be more ravishing and what's more praiseworthy is that it thrusts the narrative into its ultimacy with utter urgency and dazzlement. PRISONERS sits comfily into my top 10 year-list, PICTURE, DIRECTOR, LEADING ACTOR (2 spots), SUPPORTING ACTOR and SUPPORTING ACTRESS, for my no-gut-no-glory Oscar prediction, I sincerely hope Deakins can sneak in, alas, even so, he is no chance of winning over GRAVITY (2013, 9/10).",

The Paul Dano character endures 10 hours of interrogation by Gyllenhaal, then when he is released, suddenly whispers a clue to one of the fathers (Hugh Jackman), which no one else can hear, and therefore no one believes. The result is Jackman capturing and torturing Dano for a week-- and he still won't talk. Why not? So the filmmakers can have him tortured twice.3. The other suspect (David Dastmalchian), another man who was once kidnapped and abused, keeps trunks full of snakes in his house. Evidently, this is just to scare the police, and the audience, but it only confuses things.2. Okay, I know this will be about as popular as saying that Ryan Gosling actually looks like a gosling (which he does), but here goes: Jake Gyllenhaal has one expression: doleful. Given how dumb his character is, that almost works. Still, you'd think that an animal expression would cross his countenance occasionally.1. Motivation. While we drown in motivation for Jackman's vigilantism, little motivation is provided for the crime(s). We're told the kidnappings are the perpetrators' way of \"getting back at God\" because their son died. It's a lazy, trumped-up reason for a thriller. And the balance is way off. The filmmakers wallow in the torture of innocent suspects, motivated by \"good\" characters (Jackman, Howard, Davis), while the real villain is hardly seen until the end, and the motive for having tortured children is only mentioned in passing. It's amoral film-making. By the time the movie is over, my relief and apathy were so great that all I wanted was escape. If I'd had a toy whistle, I'd have been just like Hugh Jackman at that point.",

It's got a lot of suspense, and plot twists galore so that from the very beginning you're never really sure who is or isn't guilty, and the ultimate revelation of that caught me at least completely by surprise. As a result of that, this can also be a bit confusing at times, but it's never a movie that you lose interest in.The basic story revolves around the search for two young girls who have gone missing without a trace. The families are friends, and are fully involved in the search. There's a prime suspect, but no definite evidence against him. The movie is not just a story about the search for the girls. It's also a study of how far people are prepared to go when they're desperate.Hugh Jackman was excellent as Keller Dover - one of the desperate fathers, who takes his desperation to the extreme. Paul Dano also did well as the prime suspect - the mentally challenged Alex. Unlike others, I really wasn't that taken with Jake Gyllenhaal as the detective in charge of the case. For me, he really didn't seem to work in the role.Overall, though, this is an excellent and suspenseful thriller. (8/10)",

At one point you'll be about 20 minutes ahead of the supposedly genius detective--who doesn't seem to do much detecting whatsoever. The biggest sin of the film is that you don't care about anyone in the film. You don't care who the \"bad\" person is, you don't care if the kids are alive or dead, you don't care about anything and you have a LOT of time to not care about it -- more than two and a half hours! Seriously, at ninety minutes this story MIGHT have been captivating. At 150+ it's mind blowingly dull. None of the characters have any basement--none of them have more than a sentence or two worth of backstory to inform their present, the women characters are absolutely wasted. Poor Maria Bello can never catch a break--her character lies in bed the whole movie. Terrible waste.Viola Davis is the best of the cast--she almost always is, but even she doesn't get much room to do anything. The film also goes for numerous cheap shots, blatantly obvious red herrings with no purpose but to manipulate the audience. What a waste of pretty much everyone involved. Ugh.",

            "content": "STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningKeller Dover (Hugh Jackman) and his wife Grace (Maria Bello) are plunged in to every parent's worst nightmare when their daughter goes missing, along with the daughter of their close friends Franklin (Terence Howard) and Nancy (Viola Davis.) The finger of suspicion ends up pointing at Alex (Paul Dano), a local impaired boy, but due to a lack of evidence, Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal), the detective in charge of the investigation, is forced to let him go, much to Keller's chagrin. He takes the law in to his own hands in a desperate bid to find out where his daughter is, but nothing is quite as it seems and the real reason behind the girl's disappearance may be deeper buried than they thought.Sometimes, a simple, straight-forward story can work on far more levels and have a lot more to it if there are some strong human dynamics behind the scenes of it, i.e. in this case the ultimate nightmare of any parent, the loss of a child. Denis Villeneuve's Prisoners sets itself on a much grander scale than your average staple thriller, driven as it is by a strong sense of dark, forbidding atmosphere and stark exploration of human emotions and dynamics. In short, it has a lot more going for it than your typical thriller of it's ilk, filling every second of it's two and a half hour running time with hidden depths that just keep on coming, even if at times it all just does feel a little over whelming.While it's cascading down this emotional roller coaster ride, it's careful never to forget or unduly expose the mystery element to the story, keeping up the suspense over the missing girls and who or even what could be behind their disappearance. For material of this length, strong performances are a no brainer, and indeed we have revelatory turns from lead stars Gyllenhaal, turning in maybe his most intense, driven performance yet as the detective under pressure from others that never lets up, driven mad by constant potential break-throughs that lead nowhere, but it's Jackman as the tormented parent who possibly makes the biggest impression, channeling his Wolverine anger into something that will gain him more appreciation with a different audience.In aiming that bit higher than your typical thriller fare, Prisoners may be a bit too much for some to take in, and occasionally it is a little pretentious and see-through in trying to be deep, but it is no less of an accomplished effort that succeeds in what it sets out to do. ****",

But one day when his daughter & her friend go missing and the police fails to make any breakthroughs for days, Keller takes matters into his own hands & sets out to find his daughter by targeting the prime suspect for information before it's too late.Denis Villeneuve's direction here carries the very riddles & moral complications of his previous works and these elements eventually end up playing a major role in shaping up the whole experience of this film. Roger Deakins' cinematography is another standout as the entire film has a dark & mysterious ambiance enveloping it & even the sequences filmed in minimum light are able to retain a crisp clarity.Coming to the performances, Prisoners has a pretty reliable cast but it's Hugh Jackman & Jake Gyllenhaal who end up impressing the most. Jackman plays Keller Dover; the grief-stricken father of the missing girl, & delivers an emotionally charged performance. But he is constantly challenged by Gyllenhaal who delivers a knockout performance as Detective Loki; the officer spearheading this perplexing case.On an overall scale, Prisoners is a labyrinth of moral & ethical ambiguities represented through the degeneration of an immensely faithful & God-fearing person into a remorseless sinner, all exhibited in a darkly compelling manner, and it's also an interesting focus on the devastating change an event like the one depicted in this film can bring in any parent out there.

It was one of the best thrillers I have ever seen and it was a disturbing watch. Now viewing it for a second time, those thoughts stay the same. The two and a half hour long movie takes the slow burn approach in telling the story, but that makes it even the better. Roger Deakin's cinematography is very effective as he draws on bleak, cold colors to bring us a constant sense of foreboding. I have never seen a movie as tense and it was almost a relief when the credits finally rolled up. But this is the kind of movie that will stay with you for weeks on end.Denis Villeneuve's film is about a man named Keller Dover who does all he can including bending the law to find his missing daughter who just suddenly disappeared with her friend after Thanksgiving dinner. There is Detective Loki who is assigned to the case and he must keep an eye on Keller while he puts all of his effort in finding the missing girls.There are no words to describe the acting of the film because it's just so darn good. Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal are the stars of the show as they deliver career-best performances. Hugh is fantastic as the screaming and clawing Dover who goes beyond the law to achieve his means. Gyllenhaal is the smart detective whose mannerisms including those facial tics are part of the character and his personality. Terrence Howard and Viola Davis deliver magnificent performances as the other kidnapped girls parents. Paul Dano was excellent as one of the suspects who can hardly utter a word. Finally, Melissa Leo is beyond recognizable as she delivers a creepy performance.Overall, Prisoners is not entertaining in a sense you would call a blockbuster, but it's a character study that shows what a parent would do to protect his loved ones. It's an undeniably a hard watch, but it may be worth that. This is the kind of film that you will never forget and it's a shame how this film got snubbed by the Academy. This is a foreboding, dark crime thriller and is one of the best films of 2013. Also for that ending......well it's an open book and everyone may have their own interpretations. I didn't like it too much the first time around, but it grew on me for the second time. The film surely packs a punch. I rate this film 10/10.",

Let's just say I would not want to be on the receiving end of Hugh Jackman's fist. Hugh Jackman was torturing this guy (the weirdo from There will be Blood) for the entire movie. Jake G was good as the cop and where ever this was filmed had a really gritty feel about it. It rained all the time. What bothered me was how Terrence Howard cried or was watery eyed during the entire movie. Hugh Jackman had to convince him to not be a cry baby on more than one occasion. The lady, Ms. Jones, was played by a young actress which was really good to. Hugh Jackman and she get into it on more than one occasion. Was this movie long? yes. Was it good? Yes. Will Hugh Jackman get an Oscar nod? I sure hope so. This movie had a great plot and a protagonist and antagonist. Hugh Jackman started off the movie as a nice person but transitioned into a mad man. Good going Hugh Jackman. I look forward to more of these kinds of roles. Your Wolverine character is played out. Oh, and the ending? Well let's just say that the ENTIRE movie theater moaned.

I think this one does too because it was so well acted, so well done, and succeeded in making you think and keeping you on the edge of your seat.That being said, this was a pretty sick movie. Very depressing, left you with a feeling of dread and distrust in humans. Again, some people value that, but I just wasn't feeling it after the movie.The biggest thing for me was the fact that at the end of all this, the girls are found, and you find out the kid Hugh Jackman was torturing was entirely innocent...a victim himself. So, with that extreme moral dilemma being resolved to highly immoral, it leaves you kind of hating Hugh Jackman, and then the ambiguous ending was kind of like...really? So if he dies, whatever...he tortured another human being for over a week in horrible ways. If he doesn't die, great he's reunited with his now very messed up family. It leaves you with not caring too much either way, but it did make me think about the implications of what had happened in the movie. Anyway, great movie, one of the most suspenseful I've seen, but I wouldn't recommend it to hardly anyone I know. There are plenty of downright depressing things going on in the world, and sitting through watching a human being torture another innocent human being is just not too worth it.Afterthought: I also disliked the clearly fabricated red herrings such as Alex hanging the dog. I can understand if he was singing the song because he is simple minded like a child, but the hanging the dog was EXTREMELY intentional. He looked at Hugh Jackman, then did it. It was ONLY there so the audience would also second guess during the whole torture aspect. Also, this other kid who had been abducted who happened to be stealing clothes and imitating a child kidnapper but was ENTIRELY unrelated to the lady? Come on. Talk about just feeding the audience highly fabricated information that was essentially unrelated but made you think it should be important.",

The main detective character was the most charismatic but the other characters seemed more real. There are other similar movies that deal with different elements of this one, such as The Vanishing and The Orphan, neither of which I want to see again though they were very well done. As a parent the idea of a child being abducted with no trace is of course very disturbing and the film makers obviously play that up a bit. Lots of crying and various people coping or failing to cope in various ways. The scenery is bleak, rainy Midwest or Canada, we get a sense of the cold and grime in these middle class people. The overwhelming flavor of this movie outside of the main plot is the essence of abuse and mental illness. We get lots of doses of that. As far as this type of genre goes, this one is more hopeful than many, there is little to no gore (one dead body that's been dead for awhile). The movie doesn't work in sharp pokes but one long slow dread buildup and it's pretty good at that. There is lots of character study here but over all I'd say it's more plot driven than character driven.

Keller starts to go over the edge, almost on the brink of insanity to try to get the two little girls back. This isn't your Mother's thriller, that's for sure, in fact, I was shocked when I found out this was a bit of a box office hit. The subject matter is absolutely gruesome. This one requires you to put your thinking cap on and leave all distractions aside. This is really tough to watch. The atmosphere is very grim, not to mention it's raining all the time, which adds to grim mood. It has an ominous score that chilled me to the bone. It took me about 45 minutes for me to fully get into this one, but that isn't a bad thing at all. It is very patient with its approach and I dug that. It is carefully thought out with torture sequences that will make even the strongest people flinch. I couldn't even fathom the pain of losing a child, or to have one disappear on you. There is not a pain the world that compares to losing a child when you're a parent. I'm not a parent, but even I know that. If you're a parent, this movie will hit very close to home, perhaps in a very uncomfortable way. The performances are amazing and I bet they were emotionally exhausted. Hugh Jackman is absolutely riveting. He is full of raw emotion. I loved how he was able and willing to throw his morals out the window and do whatever it took to find his daughter. His methods were totally understandable, if not exactly likable. If I was a father, I would do the same thing Keller did. This is Jackman's finest hour. He'll always be Wolverine to me, but the man is incredibly gifted. What a memorable show by him! Jake Gyllenhall is terrific as Detective Loki. He was on top of things the whole time and I loved his performance. Terrance Howard is very good, as is Viola Davis. I gotta mention Paul Dano's performance as a twisted, yet complex person.

Hugh Jackman is literally scary as a father willing to do whatever it takes to get his daughter back, and Jake Gyllenhaal is excellent as the detective just trying to do his job. Melissa Leo performed in this movie like her life depends on it, and Maria Bello is all too convincing as the mother who turns to substances to calm her depressions.And with these performances, I will admit that the story felt so real, it was hard to watch...But boy was it worth it! The ending might have shaken me to the core, but I was genuinely touched by the genuine depiction of love that the film portrays Drover to have for his daughter is inspiring. Whilst he might not always make the right decision, the film serves as a pertinent warning for doing the wrong things for the right reasons.

Apart from that though, everything about this movie screamed perfection.I cannot recommend this movie to anyone purely because of how brutal it is, but I can genuinely say that it is one of the greatest films I've seen in a long... long time...",

            "review_title": "From an exceptional cast assembled comes a crime thriller of exceptional quality",
            "content": "While this is a first class crime thriller, this aspect is only secondary. Above all the mystery, clues, twists and red herrings, this movie is anchored in a nerve-wrecking struggle between two personalities, assiduously drawn out throughout the entire movie. But let us take a look first at the brilliant cast assembled, the main attraction drawing me into the cinema in the first place \u2013 the magnificent seven. While convention wisdom has it that winning the Oscar puts ones name in history while mere nominees are all but forgotten almost immediately, I beg to differ. At times, winning it does not really prove anything \u2013 look at John Wayne and I need elaborate no further (he, incidentally, is among my best-liked stars). On the other hand, being nominated means more than what people gives it credit for. I'll review the cast in this context.Huge Jackman, as lead actor of \"Les Miserables\", got an Oscar nomination and won a Golden Globe. Forget about all of his previous screen persona, including Logan-Wolverine. In \"Prisoners\" you see a Jackman you've never seen before, throbbing with urgency that propels his character into a vortex of violence. Jake Gyllenhaal has just one supporting Oscar nomination, for \"Brokeback Mountain\" (which earned him a BAFTA), and should have got a lot more over the years. But never mind that. In \"Prisoners\", similarly, you see a very different Gyllenhaal from the handsome young man you are familiar with. With an atrocious hair style that spells \"mid-age\" all over, he redefines uncharismatic. Everything his character does is measured, controlled, reasoned. He has been quoted to say that in this movie, his character is the brain while Jackman's is the heart.Viola Davis has two Oscar nominations, for lead in \"The help\" and support in \"Doubt\". It verges on being incomprehensible that Maria Bello has to-date not received any Oscar nomination. Her two Golden Globe nominations, similar to Davis's Oscar nominations, were for support and lead respectively, from \"The cooler\" and \"A history of violence\". The latter, directed by none other than David Cronenberg, gave her an impressive collection of Best Actress wins in critics' award on various major cities. Terrence Howard was nominated for Best Actor by both Oscar and Golden Globe for \"Hustle and flow\". It is almost unbelievable that among the seven in this distinguished cast only one has actually won an Oscar, Melissa Leo in \"The fighter\" which won her the Golden Globe as well. Paul Dano, among today's best choices for nerdy or mentally handicapped roles, was recognized as a promising newcomer in \"Little Miss Sunshine\" and got a BAFTA support nomination a year later with \"There will be blood\".Everybody knows that about a whodunit, the less said about the plot and the developments the better. Suffices to say, therefore, that this one is not exceptionally convoluted, and certainly satisfying. And it is almost motherhood to say that a lot of crimes originate from festering, deep-rooted virulence. The most talked about aspect on this movie is not a spoiler, by the mere fact that it is so much talked-about: the moral issue of whether the objective justifies resorting to violence and torturing a crime suspect. Here, we are not talking about professional secret agents and terrorists suspects. We are talking about an everyday citizen driven to extremes by his perception of the police's incompetence in finding and rescuing his kidnapped daughter, while the clock is ticking. At this movie, many may flinch, or more. But the graphic visual has a purpose: to anchor the aforementioned conflict between the two key protagonists \u2013 the emotional father and the reasoning cop.Finally, \"Prisoners\" is the English language debut of director Denis Villeneuve. For those who have seen is Oscar-nominated \"Incendies\" (2010), nothing further needs to be said. Those who haven't will not regret going out to but a DVD.",

Keller Dover(Hugh Jackman) & his family go to his friend Franklin Birch's(Terrence Howard) house for Thanksgiving dinner. After a while, Dover & Birch's daughters, Anna(Erin Gerasimovich) & Joy(Kyla Drew Simmons) go outside to play. However, they never return. Dover assumes they're kidnapped & his son, Ralph(Dylan Minnette), tells him that there was an RV parked outside the house. The owner of this RV, Alex Jones(Paul Dano), is the primary suspect. A police officer named, Detective Loki(Jake Gyllenhaal), is given the job of finding & rescuing the girls. Thinking that the police will not get the job done, Keller Dover takes matters into his own hands & takes extreme steps to find the two girls. By the time this movie ended, I was speechless. Wow! What a movie! The suspense keeps the viewer engaged till the very last scene of the film. Throughout the film, I was on the edge of my seat, cause you really have no idea as to what's going to happen next. This movie is a roller-coaster ride of emotions, thrills & suspense. The violence may make some people squeamish but, most of it is suggested & it's not that graphic. The highlight of the film is the suspense. The script has been written so beautifully that, the viewer is left with questions even after the credits start rolling. The second highlight of the film is the performances. Hugh Jackman has given the best performance of his career as Keller Dover. Jackman's acting ability improves with each film. Jackman shows various emotions like, anger, fear, grief & repentance effortlessly. Jake Gyllenhaal is equally good as Detective Loki. His portrayal of Detective Loki is subtle & brilliant. Even though the detective may seem emotionally challenged, you can see that the pressure of the case is getting to him & this has been done by Gyllenhaal superbly. Viola Davis is great as Nancy Birch. Maria Bello is effective as Grace Dover. Terrence Howard is impressive as Franklin Birch. Melissa Leo is spectacular as Holly Jones. Last but not the least, Paul Dano is outstanding as Alex Jones. Dano does wonders with the small role that he is given. Dylan Minnette, Erin Gerasimovich & Kyla Drew Simmons are impressive as the kids, Ralph Dover, Anna Dover & Joy Birch. The supporting characters are adequate as well. Prisoners is a must watch.

A decently paced thriller for its length struggles with the weird morals of its characters, or lack thereof in 80% of the cast, as well as their inability to see that they are all prisoners to their own ideals, beliefs, desires and wants. They are inhumane creatures being portrayed as humane and no better example of this is the wife character thanking god for one of the most heinous atrocities an average human could conduct. The acting, while a touch over the top in scenes, is stellar, the cinematography is excellent and the directing superb, the writing is actually the let down, though it feels like it shouldn't be and most will be able to gloss over this as we the viewer tend to accept weaker writing so long as our emotional strings are being played eloquently.",

It is refreshing to see Hugh Jackman in a role the father to a missing child.A similar kinda movie to 'The Lovely Bones' where two young girls are go missing and their parent's never ending search for them begins. With a single clue they begin to dig every detail to bring back their children along with the help of a young cop. As expected character diversion had an important hand in mystify and confuse the viewers without falling for anything to conclude their prediction before it reveal itself.Fine photography. It was pleasant to see cool frames where there's no sun glare but always cloudy, shadow and dark atmosphere something like the movie 'The Awakening'. It brought real close to us the real grief of a family that we can almost feel it. Good or bad ending, the way it ends is all matters. In this story they give us an opportunity to take it either way as you want. One thing I was not convinced is the motivation for the abduction. The reason seemed to me a silly but in reality everything can be possible and sometimes it won't need reasons at all. Finally, it is a must not miss movie from the 2013 film calender.",

'Prisoners' is one of the best thrillers I've seen in recent times. The story is absorbing right from the get go. It locks the audience in and never lets them go for the next 150 minutes. It undoubtedly helps when your two stars are in exceptional form, both delivering some of the best performances of their careers. Jake Gyllenhaal's acting career has really come to life in the last four years or so. Here, he gives a performance perfectly suited to the film. He never drops a scene and plays off every actor he's on screen with perfectly. Topping that though is Hugh Jackman. The man showed his unbelievable acting chops back in 2006 with his performance in 'The Prestige'. Here though he quite possibly tops that. He brings life to an incredibly complex and conflicted character. If a lesser actor had taken on this role the entire film could have fallen completely flat and had no power whatsoever. He can't have been far off an Oscar nomination.When a two and a half hour film flies by and you can't believe it is over already, you know it is high in quality. Not only that, but there are many discussion points that are fascinating to talk about and debate after the film is over. I love nothing more than a debate about a film topic where no one is ever \"right\" because there is no official answer, yet people make great points that make you entirely reconsider your original opinion. This is one of those films that lends itself to that. I was initially a little put off by the length of the run time, but I implore you not to be. It's very close to being a modern masterpiece.",

            "content": "\"Prisoners\" is a methodically paced mystery about two families desperately searching for their daughters who disappear on Thanksgiving Day. Many people (my wife included) will stay away from this film based on its premise alone, finding the misery too realistic. This is unfortunate because director Denis Villeneuve, writer Aaron Guzikowski and the cast of Hollywood heavyweights have created an engaging story that is really more focused on the mystery of the girls' disappearance than on the misery of it. Now, the script can be pretty heavy handed and far-fetched at times, but there is much more to praise. There are plenty of unexpected maze-like turns, some great sound editing, and \"Prisoners\" may hold the distinction as being the most beautiful film of the year. However, the movie's main draw for many people will be the cast, which is filled with powerhouse performances. While some of the actors may be bordering on melodrama, the acting throughout is darkly stellar. Above them all is a quiet but powerful performance from Gyllenhaal as the detective given the unenviable task of solving the puzzle. This may be the first film of the year that feels to be reaching for an Oscar or two. And with some strong performances, beautiful cinematography, and a dark twisted mystery (which the Academy loves), I wouldn't be surprised to see it pop up again next February during the big ceremony. \"Prisoners\" definitely delivers as a decent, if at times absurd, mystery that is gorgeously shot and skillfully told.",

While the mystery of who abducted two little girls haunts the entirety of the 153-minute runtime and will keep audiences glued for every minute, the film also serves as a portrait of a desperate parent willing to cross any line to get his daughter back.Those who crave the classic dark and gritty \"whodunit\" and also enjoy some dramatic heft and effective gravitas will find \"Prisoners\" an enormous gift. Exhibiting consummate filmmaking and storytelling from Canadian director Denis Villeneuve, this is a true thriller that doesn't try and pull too many tricks.Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman), his wife Grace (Maria Bello) and their two kids are celebrating the Thanksgiving holiday at their neighbors' \u2014 the Birches (Terrence Howard and Viola Davis) \u2014 house. At the end of the evening, the families realizes their two little girls are missing and the lonely Police Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) gets on the case. Police apprehend the practically mute Alex Jones (Paul Dano) but let him go when they can't get him to talk and don't have any evidence to bring charges. Unsatisfied, Keller, certain Jones is hiding something, abducts him and tries to get him to talk before it's too late.Writer Aaron Guzikowski, who previously adapted \"Contraband\" from its Icelandic predecessor, delivers a straightforward script with numerous complications. The story will get under your skin while leaving enough nuggets in the mystery to keep you captivated. Unfortunately, all the twists and discoveries might generate some difference in opinion. Nothing is done, spelled out or tied up neatly and clearly \u2014 Guzikowski cares more about symbolism and themes than satisfying answers.Villeneuve appears to be a perfect pairing with this script, as he enjoys the symbolism and setting the tone early and often. \"Prisoners\" has a downright creepy vibe that will keep viewers constantly paranoid. Every shot is a portrait, with due credit to veteran cinematographer Roger Deakins. The film's stunning imagery automatically sets it apart from run-of-the-mill thrillers.Jackman's performance is the only one of note in \"Prisoners\" despite the excellent ensemble. The roles filled by Howard, Davis, Dano, Bello and Melissa Leo as Alex's aunt could've been done by anyone. A good case could be made for Gyllenhaal too, but his character is straightforward \u2014 a detective whose primary concern is to solve the damn case to shake off his own expectations and those of others.The aspect of \"Prisoners\" that should garner the most praise is the way it incorporates strong character elements in with the main mystery narrative. Just as crucial to the story is the way Keller, a God-fearing man whose life philosophy is \"pray for the best, prepare for the worst,\" begins to unravel mentally and morally after the disappearance of his child. He proves to be far from the protagonist when all is said and done and the resolution of his individual story becomes of equal importance to the resolution of the greater mystery.\"Prisoners\" only begins to crumble a bit when it comes to sorting out the truth from the distractions and driving home the central themes. Religious imagery and ideas dominate the beginning of the movie and get peppered in throughout, but there's a lack of follow through. The notion of the unsolvable maze, which comes into play at one point, also seems relevant to the story, but is never explained. The movie wants you to think about its ideas rather than its outcomes, which is a fair request, but the outcomes better be straightforward enough to discern and in many cases they aren't.Dark, cold and troubling, \"Prisoners\" is a brooding thriller with both substantial dramatic and mystery elements. Villeneuve is a talent to keep an eye on in the future as with Guzikowski, despite the flaws in the wrap-up of the film. ~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com",

Prisoners is a slow burner that tightens the tension steadily and by climax the pressure hits the roof. The aha moment when Dover puts all the pieces in place and the consequences that follow is simply a stroke of genius from writer Aaron Guzikowski.A good suspenseful plot can be occasionally seen in an episode of a procedural TV show. Terrific acting from an ensemble cast is usually a part of an award bait drama and then rarely comes the amalgamation of both resulting in an \"Argo\" or a \"Silence of the lambs\".

However, I do have to commend Director Denis Villenueve's brilliant thriller about a desperate father's actions after his daughter is missing. Hugh Jackman delivers the best performance of his career as the Pennsylvania working-class father Keller Dover. On a Thanksgiving, Dover and his wife and two kids were celebrating the holiday at their best friends' home who are the Birches.; I guess those Sons of Birches could not just celebrate the holiday by themselves. Kidding! On that sad day, the Dovers' young daughter Anna and the Birches' young daughter Eve went missing; a mysterious RV parked in front of the Birches' home might have had something to do with it. When the driver of the RV named Alex Jones is arrested as a possible suspect, Keller goes all \"cray cray\" in order for the police not to release him even though there is not suffice evidence to book Jones. Jake Gyllenhaal co-stars as Detective Loki, who is not the real \"loco\" in the picture, but does get obsessed to solve the case and find the missing girls. Villenueve's direction was superb and some might argue that he was sadly missing in the list of Oscar- nominated film directors for 2013. Aaron Guzilowski's screenplay was pure, even though \"Prisoners\" sometimes got locked up with some clich\u00e9s. It was great to see Jackman hide those big nails and singing voice, and transform himself into a character where he wore his emotions on his sleeve, and Hugh better believe that Jackman delivered the goods with his outstanding performance here. Gyllenhaal was also very good as Loki, as he continues his stellar acting career. Melissa Leo was stunning as the mysterious Aunt of Alex Jones; And speaking of Mr. Jones, Mr. Jones, Mr. Jones- Paul Dano delivered another effective cringe-worthy work as Alex Jones. Roger Deakins' cinematography of \"Prisoners\" was a scenic tour-de-force, even though I think that Deakins' \"arrested development\" of not getting the Oscars he deserves is a cinetragedy. OK, so I did write way too many pun-induced sentences for \"Prisoners\" after all; I guess that was a \"hard cell\" for you to believe I wouldn't. However, it is an easy sale for me to recommend the excellent \"Prisoners\". ***** Excellent",

            "content": "Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) is just an ordinary family man who is devoted to his wife and young children. Dover's daughter Anna Dover and her friend Zoe Birch are abducted and Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) is assigned to the case. Loki arrests Alex Jones based on the fact that his RV was parked near to the Dover's house shortly before the abduction. Loki holds Jones for 24 hours whilst he tries to gather evidence against him, but when he is unable to get any further information from Jones (due to him being unable to answer questions as he has the IQ of a 10 year old) and due to a lack of evidence, Loki is forced to release him. However, when Jones tells Dover (with reference to the 2 girls) that 'he heard them crying when he left them', Dover is convinced that Loki has made a mistake in releasing Jones and takes it upon himself to kidnap Jones and use his own 'methods' to find out what has happened to his daughter. Meanwhile, Loki continues with his investigations.Prisoners is a gritty, intense and emotional ride with a top notch performance from Jackman (I honestly don't think I've seen a better performance from him). His performance of a 'desperate' father who will do anything to try and find his daughter was brilliant and the fact that he was so convincing in his role helped to give the film lots of credibility. Dano was also brilliant as the rather simple Alex Jones (I thought he was really good in There Will Be Blood, but he was excellent here). The film also features Franklin Birch (Terrence Howard) and Nancy Birch (Viola Davis) as the other kidnapped girl's parents. They were both good, but weren't given much to do. Prisoners isn't exactly original and we have seen many examples of films where 1 man feels as though 'justice' hasn't been served and decides to serve out his own form of justice, but I don't generally complain about a film being unoriginal as long as it is well executed and that's where the strengths lie in Prisoners. This film gets the basics right; the audience care for Dover and his plight and it's certainly very emotional and was tense and engaging from start to finish, but there were problems with the script; Firstly, there is a scene where another potential suspect is arrested and brought into a police station and when Loki gets heavy when investigating him he pulls a gun out and shoots himself. OK, how did he manage to get a gun in a police station (after being arrested) without anybody knowing? Why was he not searched when he was arrested and then again when he was brought into the police station? I can suspend disbelief for certain things, but there is no way that this would happen. Secondly, we learn that Alex Jones's aunt Holly Jones was the person responsible for the abduction of the girls. The scene that follows shows her pointing a gun at Dover and asking him to put his phone into the disposer. Dover appears to do this, but then picks his phone back up. Alex's aunt forces him into a hole where she had kept the girls hostage and puts a board across it, drives her car onto the board and leaves him for dead. What I couldn't understand is that if Dover had his phone, why didn't he use it? Perhaps he couldn't get a signal, or maybe his battery died. Who knows? This is never clarified.The open ended \"conclusion\" will undoubtedly divide audiences. Personally, I hate films that end like that as to me it's just lazy writing. I was disappointed that I sat watching a film for 2 and a half hours and then to find that it didn't really have an ending. Some people may like the idea that they're left to draw their own conclusions, but not me as I think it's a cop out and a very weak way to end a film.Overall, this film gets a lot more right than it gets wrong. The grittiness, emotion and tension that exists throughout the film makes this film a MUST watch. Jackman and Dano should be singled out for particular praise. What ultimately let the film down was the holes in the script and the rather lame ending. It's a very good film, but not quite as good as I was hoping it would be.",

When the daughters go missing, in broad daylight, two sets of parents are confronted with their worst nightmares...To begin with the good, \"Prisoners\" benefits from some outstanding performances. Both Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal deserve any kind of award the movie industry can think up : they truly disappear into their characters. This is also a very well-directed movie which conjures up a pervasive atmosphere of dread and uncertainty. There's a constant sense of something evil, something unhinged lurking just behind the corner. (When that evil is finally uncovered, near the end of the movie, it turns out that \"Prisoners\" has created a villain for the ages.)However, the movie also has its drawbacks. Its many strands and ideas do not fit together perfectly - where, for instance, does this snake motif come from ? - and some plot elements are ill-judged. So two little girls disappear under the most suspicious of circumstances, and the police put only one detective on the case ? What does it take to prod the local police into action, in that part of the world ? A band of radioactive cannibals organising a slaughter of the innocents in City Hall ?The movie explores a grim question, to wit, how far would a loving parent go in order to save his child ? (The answer is : VERY far.) Viewers interested in \"contrast and compare\" might want to take a look at a recent French thriller with a similar theme, called \"Mon gar\u00e7on\".",

For a two and a half hour movie i would recommend you those two movies. You won't regret watching \"Prisoners\" if you like thriller/drama kind. Too bad i didn't saw it first on the cinema, it would have been a better experience to watch. I just hope it won't take long until i'll watch another great thriller.",

            "content": "\"Pray for the best, but prepare for the worst.\"Prisoners is a dark thriller that will have you at the edge of your seat during almost the entirety of the film. It was a very intense experience. It is hard not to compare this film to Mystic River or Gone Baby Gone because those two movies set the landmark for modern thrillers dealing with abduction. Prisoners almost lives up to the standards that those two films set. Canadian director, Denis Villeneuve, follows up his Oscar nominated film, Incendies, with this intense thriller that manages to capture the audiences attention once again. Incendies was one of my favorite films of 2011, and despite Prisoners not living up to the perfection that film achieved, I still thought this film was highly entertaining and satisfying. There were a few minor plot points that didn't work for me, but that didn't take anything away from this great film. It is a more mainstream film, but it manages to follow a similar approach as Fincher reminding us of Se7en or Zodiac thanks to its dark and haunting atmosphere. I am a huge fan of this genre and really had a fun time trying to solve the mystery through the small clues that Villeneuve masterfully presented in the story. Prisoners was without a doubt one of the most gripping and intense experiences I had all year. Unfortunately it is a little too intense and at times I felt the film could have used some moments to release such tension. Anyways Prisoners is a highly recommended film and a must-see. Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) is a family man who is always prepared for the worst. He is a survivalist with a basement full of provisions and is teaching his older son, Ralph (Dylan Minnette), how to hunt. He's married to Grace (Maria Bello) and they have a daughter named Anna (Erin Gerasimovich). One afternoon, Keller's worst nightmare comes true while they are hanging out with their friendly neighbors the Birches. Franklin (Terrence Howard) and Nancy Birch (Viola Davis) have two kids about the same age as Ralph and Grace, Eliza (Zoe Borde) and Joy (Kyla Drew Simmons). While the two families are having a lovely time together, Joy and Anna decide to go back to Anna's house, but when the Dover's come back home they are horrified to discover that the kids never made it back. Ralph remembers that they were playing next to a strange RV that was parked up front which is now gone. Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) is appointed as the lead investigator in the case and the first thing he does is locate the RV. The driver is a disturbed young man named Alex Jones (Paul Dano) who has the IQ of a 10 year old and with no evidence to incriminate him Detective Loki has to let him free. His Aunt (Melissa Leo) comes to pick him up and explains how naive and innocent he is. As hours pass, Keller begins to get more desperate and convinced that Alex was involved he decides to take matters into his own hands. From here on the tension begins to escalate as they try to solve the mystery.Prisoners succeeds as a neo-noir thriller building up a lot of tension with a very dark atmosphere which is perfectly captured by cinematographer Roger Deakins. It adds to the mysterious mood of the story which on its own is already pretty intense. The screenplay, written be Aaron Guzikowski (Contraband), is very well written with a very interesting premise and some great twists. My only complaint with this film has to do with the lack of a strong female character. With such a strong cast, I thought that Maria Bello or Viola Davis could have been given a stronger role, but the film focuses mostly on Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal. They both give very strong and convincing performances, and Gyllenhaal has surprised me over the last three years with very good films (Source Code, End of Watch, and now this one). I guess he has been choosing his roles very wisely lately because his next film also looks interesting (Enemy which is also directed by Denis Villeneuve). Paul Dano also gave a strong performance as his character's motivations were very hard to decipher. The strong cast and the interesting story make this a very entertaining film despite some minor flaws involving character motivations. It is one of the best recent thrillers coming out of Hollywood and I doubt you will be disappointed.",

            "content": "On the surface, Prisoners is an engaging mystery with some all-out brilliant performances from Jackman and Gyllenhaal alike. However, in its center, Prisoners is hardly just another dark thriller, but rather a exposition on the lengths people are willing to go, and the people they are because of it. I had been holding off on watching this one for a while now, not because I thought it would be bad or too long, in fact I nearly thought the opposite. I am a big fan of Villeneuve's and have been for a while now, and when I first heard of Prisoners and saw the trailer, I knew it was going to be something really special- and my expectations were correct. First off, the cinematography in this film is outstanding, not relying on beautiful fixtures, but just grounded and realistic angles that truly propel the film to a more integrated feel. However, this is hardly the best thing about the movie, despite the Oscars thinking so. The fact that neither Jackman nor Gyllenhaal received even a nomination for this film is a crime. I like Matthew McConaughey as much as the next guy, and I thought Dicaprio was fantastic in Wall Street (in fact he should have won), but Jackman and Gyllenhaal put just as much effort (if not more) into their performances and it is really dumbfounding to me how they got so little credit. Villeneuve's directing style may be criticized as dark and depressing for some, but I feel it was just the right amount for the situation at hand, and yet never too much where the film felt it was overbearing to watch. The score is excellent, its endlessly entertaining, and I was able to keep myself engaged throughout its entire nearly 3 hour runtime. In the end, Prisoners is an excellent must see thriller with excellent performances and excellent direction throughout (not to mention writing), don't miss this one.\nMy Rating: 10/10",

            "content": "At the beginning of \"Prisoners\" two little children from two families celebrating Thanksgiving together disappear. The rest of the film is a hunt for a maniac, not unlike for example \"Seven\" (1995, David Fincher).What makes this hunt special is that it is not only executed by a detective (Detective Loki played by jake Gyllenhaal) but also by the father of one of the children (Keller Dover played by Hugh Jackman) who becomes a maniac himself in the proces.In the opening scene we see Keller Dover hunting with his teenange son, this time not for a maniac but for a deere. This opening scene characterizes Keller Dover very well and so lays the foudation for the rest of the movie. Keller Dover is a religious man (we hear prayers in the background) that strongly beliefs in self-sustainability. He does not trust the government very much, but he does rely on his own basement full of survival equipment (all of a sudden all that stands between you and being dead is you).In the rest of the film this belief in self support and the distrust of the government evolves into Keller taking the law in his own hands. This moral decay is symbolized by the difference between the tidy house in which Keller lives with his family and the dilapidated house of his late parents in which he takes the law in his own hands. The father of the other missing child remains sensible, but is not capable of adjusting Keller. It is the other way round, and this may be the most scaring observation of the movie.The rest of the film is also permeated with religious symbolism. I just mention snakes symbolising satan. Noteworthy is also that the detective is named after the Nordic god LokiTo be honest the plot of \"Prisoners\" is not very original. The strength of the film lies (as already said) in the interaction (and the balance of power) between the father that glides into madness and the father that stays with his senses. Also very good is the cinematography of Roger Deakins. Thanksgiving is celebrated in october (Canada) or november (USA), so wintry landscapes dominate.",

            "content": "What happens after a family is shattered by the disappearance of a small child is darkly explored in Prisoners. Keller Dover, played by Hugh Jackman, is on a personal mission to find his daughter before its too late. An old truck camper as mysteriously seen in the Dover's neighborhood reveals an oddball suspect likely purposely named Alex Jones. When the police are forced to let Jones go Dover's obsession to take matters into his own hands quickly spins out of control. This is set against the mystery of Jone's apparently mental deficiency and seemingly innocuous aunt who is his caregiver. The film quickly proceeds painting a dark psychological thriller. Whatever is going on with Alex Jones and his aunt seems more pathetic than threatening even though Jones is most certainly is involved. Caught in the middle is police detective Loki, played by Jake Gyllenhaal. Loki's character is as intense in his will to find the two girls as is Dover's. Clearly, being on two different sides of the law while solving the crime puts Dover and Loki at odds with one another. The performances by Jackman and Gyllenhaal are such that these two create a mountain of tension on an already \"edge of your seat\" atmosphere created by the writers and pounded home by the excellent atmospherically dark location shooting.Brilliantly, Prisoners doesn't give up too much as it builds a bleak picture of how all approach the battle of good versus evil. Moral questions swirl like black storm clouds touching all involved. This is a complex crime thriller that makes the viewer uneasy for the entire ride. It has a feel of realism and intellectualism while being 100% accessible save for the dread feeling of depravity which makes watching akin to witnessing a macabre disaster. In this regard one wants to look away, but simply can't. Prisoners achieves everything it sets out to with a cast non-parallel who all give uniformly excellent performances (i.e.the best ever from Jackman and Gyllenhaal to date). The supporting cast is above all scrutiny with spot-on direction and cinematography combining to weave superlatively written story never veering too far out or even feeling remotely like a crime story retread. This is a highly recommended movie - a must see.",

            "content": "Pray for the best, but prepare for the worst.My wife wanted to watch another thriller. And what a thriller it was ultimately. With a thriller of such high level as \"Prisoners\", my wife starts to surf the internet so she can read the plot. She begins to get nervous and says in a indignant way that everything takes far too long and was terribly stretched.\"Prisoners\" is a real nail-biting movie and actually a mix of a psychological drama with a heart-pounding suspense and a dash of horror. A mix of \"Mystic River\" and every top movie where a serial killer is hunted down like \"The Silence of the Lambs\" or more recently \"The Frozen Ground\". The viewer is confronted with terrible questions of conscience. How far would you go when your dearest person is taken away? Would you dare to take the law into your own hands and commit degrading acts to find the truth ? We are also witnessing the desperation and helplessness that an investigator of such crimes feels.Hugh Jackman plays the role of the father in despair, Keller Dover, with lot of enthusiasm. He shows a person torn by frantic rage and immense sadness because he first lost his lovable daughter and secondly fails as a householder who said he could protect his family against anything. His wife Grace, played by Maria Bello, gets in a depressed state as the days are progressing. Sleep and antidepressants are the only things that can still help her. The remaining son looks at it all from a distance and watches over Grace while Keller is constantly absent. We also get a view of the other family Birch , especially Franklin Birch who helps Keller with his desperate plan afterwards, but their emotions are not as detailed unraveled as those of the Dover's.It all begins with the disappearance of the daughters Anna and Joy when the two families celebrate Thanksgiving. The two girls had played that afternoon nearby a white mobile-home parked in front of the door which is now no longer visible. A police description is passed around and that same evening the mobile-home is spotted on a parking lot of a gas station. This is the moment Detective Loki comes into the picture. For me a huge achievement in terms of acting by Jake Gyllenhaal. Amazing how he portrays the inspector. The passion, the tics and the way he puts his teeth into the case, while sometimes it seems as if it doesn't really interests him. How careless he reads text messages and seemingly almost writes down nothing. When Grace makes a remark about that, he starts writing something in his notebook in a careless way. The fact is, that so far he has solved all the cases that were given to him.The driver of the mobile home is trying to escape and eventually arrested. The car is searched but nothing is found. What remains is the meaningless and confused explanation of the twenty years old Alex Jones, who has a mental retardation and the IQ of a 10 year old. Due to a lack of evidence they need to release Alex, while Keller is firmly convinced that Alex is guilty and should not go unpunished. When Alex uses the sentence \"They only cried when i left\", Keller loses control and forgets every Christian commandment although he normally holds on to that as a devout Christian. He even exceeds the bounds of humanity in such a way that a return is impossible.And this is the most important moral question of this movie. Would you torture someone, you're sure of he's guilty, so you can find out the truth. As a father I am convinced that the disappearance of your daughter is the worst you can experience as a human being. An inhuman nightmare. And after hearing the pronounced sentence, which is open to interpretation, I also would be capable of doing such a thing. Even if it should turn out that the person is innocent.The course of the film is painfully and annoyingly slow. Maybe a cinematic portrayal of the excruciatingly long time parents of missing children need to endure while waiting for positive news. It's also logical and insightful put together. Successively, we have to deal with the discovery of the remains of a child rapist in the basement of a priest, a copycat who eventually seizes the opportunity to shoot a bullet through his brains and the final denouement which wasn't totally unexpected but because of the prior still surprising. Several times I read about the fact that there are quite a few holes in the scenario, and things turn out to be wrong. I can't put my finger directly on any flaw in this movie. The mystery of the maze is that I think there really isn't one but just a perception in the mind of both a retarded boy and an abused boy. The latter looked at this image (also the medallion of the deceased father) for years. The only thing that I was still wondering about are the snakes. Do they have a particular symbolic meaning ? Also the unprofessional actions of the law enforcement officers bothered me. The superintendent wasn't much of a help in solving the case. And in such an important criminal case , I certainly wouldn't leave the prime suspect unattended. And I think the aunts house would be searched through thoroughly.Final conclusion: In my opinion this was the best movie I watched in 2013. A poignant, terrible emotionally movie with a strong storyline, engaged in a cinematic depressed decor with its greyish tones and perpetual drizzle and carried by a top cast. It shows once again shows that there are totally sick minds that inhabit our planet, and that religion is used again as an excuse to condone it.More reviews at http://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be/",

Why do they need to stay alive? 5 - guy gets beaten & imprisoned in a cube of pain for a week, yet can't manage to articulate \"my aunt did it.\" He was coherent enough to say \"They only cried when I left them\" to Hugh Jackman when Hugh Jackman grabs him by the throat in public; but he can't manage \"after my aunt took them away\" when Hugh Jackman beats him nearly to death? 6 - cop is angry, goes to his desk, throws things around, by CHANCE things fall on the floor & he sees a new CRUCIAL clue.It's a movie of bad red herrings, and coincidence. PS. Cop goes into a room of trunks and RUSHES to open one! It's full of SNAKES! Now if I opened up the first trunk in a room full of trunks and the first trunk was full of snakes, I don't think I would open all the other trunks, yet Cop wants to open more!",

            "content": "I'm always actively pursuing the next dark thriller that will hold a candle to the film Se7en. I think that was easily the most brilliant crime thriller I have ever seen. I suspected that Prisoners could potentially be a terrific film and I was so pleased to discover that it is exactly that. I don't mean to say it was good as Se7en but it absolutely holds its own. There were some truly outstanding performances (and a couple of underwhelming ones), but the best part of this film was the script. What a brilliantly crafted, artistic, stunning film filled with symbolism, twists, turns and darkness. The film clocks in at a lengthy 2 1/2 hours but I didn't think it dragged at all. The pacing was consistent and I can't imagine any aspect of the film not being there in order to tell the full story. The clues added up, the twists made sense and I was able to put together the story and figure it out even before it was revealed (which is unusual for me.) But I mean that to be a good thing. As a movie goer you are privy to every detail and clue. This is absolutely not a typical mainstream film. Critics are raving about it and for good reason! I expected Hugh Jackman would give a good performance and he does. He is a powerful presence on screen and his unravelling as he desperately tries to find his daughter and will literally go to any length is disturbing and terrific. Jackman deserves acclaim once again for another performance. I thought Jackman would be the best performance in the film BUT that honour in my opinion goes to Jake Gyllenhaal. He is just electrifying on screen and what an amazing character he brings to life. Just watching him do this is fascinating because his character has so many ticks, habits, tattoo's...he clearly has a huge back story that we don't know about. I think its unusual but also brilliant for a film maker to give so much depth to a supporting character. Paul Dano gives a solid and very creepy performance as the accused Alex Jones. Dano is good but he might oversell it just a little bit in some scenes. Same goes for Melissa Leo (whom I admit I am sort of tired of and always found her overrated.) She is good in her role as Dano's Aunt but in some scenes I felt like she was overacting especially towards the end. I love Viola Davis, I think she is a great actor and she is decent in this but sort of underused and despite one particularly good scene between her and Dano, she sort of flounders in the shadow of Jackman and Gyllenhaal. The final two performances were the worst in the film unfortunately. Terrence Howard might have been alright if his character has been given more to work with. But when you have one father who is showing some powerful emotions and going to all ends to find his daughter...Howard's character comes across as skittish and boring. He looks terrified enough but that's the only emotion he demonstrates. I can't even say Maria Bello would be good under any circumstances because her character and her performance was just awful. Most of the film she spends in bed thank goodness but even in her gut wrenching grief it is overdone and overacted. Its really unfortunate because it somehow drags Jackman's scenes down just a little when she's in them. She is the weak link of this cast by far.Oscar nominated director Denis Villeneuve crafts the best thriller I think I've seen all year. I long to see the special features on a Blu-Ray release to see if he discusses all the things that were purposely done in this movie. It is clearly set in modern day and yet the homes, the appliances, the vehicles, the decor...all have a distinctive 70's/80's vibe to it. Despite some mediocre to bad performances by the main cast the film is not dragged down completely by it. Jackman and Gyllenhall are very nearly awe-inspiring in their parts so it balances out nicely. The film is so grey and bleak and the scenes are perfectly shot to leave you wondering what is coming next and what is happening. I am not a prude by any means and I can watch just about anything and have but I felt like the extreme language (particularly the \"F\" word) was used FAR too much. I do believe completely that it was necessary in many spots and added to the characters but it was overused again and again until it became distracting and I hate that. Honestly, Prisoners is a 10/10 movie that loses points for silly little things that should have been avoided. The story is a 10, two performances are 10's, the cinematography is a 10...but then when you start looking at things that took away from how great these things were you have to penalize it a little. Regardless, True Crime fans or anyone looking for a really above average thriller cannot go wrong with this one. I think there was so much symbolism in this movie that I missed the first time around and the bizarre but appropriate religious undertones as well. See it for yourself but make sure you understand this isn't a blow-em-up action flick but rather a brilliant, masterpiece of crime film. 8.5/10",

            "content": "The title of the film, \"Prisoners\", is the first mystery you will need to figure out. It's puzzling because it is technically not set in a prison nor the main characters are actually prisoners. The best thing to presume is it's a metaphorical term that might refer to the characters' imprisonment to the bleakness of their situation. The film has an intriguing idea for a verisimilitude, but the only thing that breaks that conceit is the twist in the end. However, it's still quite the experience for being a brilliantly made and terribly gripping crime drama.The investigation is scattered with MacGuffins all over the place, assuming that the film asks the audience to think hard through the mystery as well, but the real idea of the story is how a kidnapping situation may also affect to the lives of the people related to the victims, especially to the one who are desperately worried about them. How this crime can change their humanity, like the father who forces himself to commit bad things just to get them back. The whole message is obvious, but it's no denying how fascinating to study these people by their actions. One is an ugly revenge, while the other is a deliberated case that gives a lot of pressure to the detective. It's extremely gripping, but when it hits to the revelation, it somehow loses a bit of the plot's credibility. It might be for consequential reasons, but it would have been more interesting if it was less conventional.It's pretty wise to include the parts when the characters are allowed to take time to breathe, if only those parts were a little less broad in their expressions of being mad, but they get quite effective. The performances are amazing enough. Hugh Jackman might be overdoing some of the father's rage, but his greatest feat overpowers the performance. Jake Gyllenhaal, I'm saying this once again, steals the show. His acting career is recently getting better and better. Here, Detective Loki is a character that you should be rooting for throughout the film, and Gyllenhaal justifies it. The direction is artful and weighs every scene of drama, action, and suspense. While the cinematography sharply displays how bleak these lives are.Despite some of its misstep, Prisoners is an outstanding cinema; it's magnificent in direction, fantastic in acting, stunning in cinematography, and best at pacing. Of course, it never forgets to depict how a terrible crime could cause other people. Not only the victims and the suspects are in trouble here. The result of this can be love ones raging in terror, ugly vigilantism, hard time for the law, and more consequences. This is a strong subject that deserves a lot of complexity. It still includes some exasperation near the end, but aside the conclusion, Prisoners is wholly satisfying anyway.",

Compared with, say, 'The Silence of the Lambs' this slow-paced (a compliment, as the usual hyperactive pacing of Hollywood is almost a sickness) bleak mainstream film is hands down a better movie, making Demme's seem trivial, in hindsight. What I loved about Prisoners is the way that it was all about the story and the characters; the visual style was invisible and never imposed itself on the viewer. It was wonderfully directed in a manner that recalled classics by Nicolas Ray(They Live By Night), William Wyler(Desperate Hours), Billy Wilder(Double Indemnity) or John Ford (The Searchers). You could just walk into this terrifying film and feel the emotions portrayed flawlessly by the cast. The best example being perhaps Maria Bello who is my choice for best supporting actress this year with special mention going to Gyllenhaal whose idiosyncratic performance is at the heart of this film; his effortless charisma and skill place him among the very best, he is also a natural audience favorite capable of earning a very high level of empathy for his work.",

The director, Denis Villeneuve showed how good an director he is with the visual story telling and that is where the movie is strongest. Cinematography is insanely good, one thing I liked was the long shots as it gave the actors to really act and be the character which they did and provided emotion to the roles.

            "review_title": "A Powerful Tale that Blurs the Line Between Right/Wrong",
            "content": "There was so much positive buzz when PRISONERS premiered on the festival circuit that I really expected it to have some presence at awards time. As the father of a little girl, I had a little extra bias settling in to watch this movie because the idea of a father in a desperate search for his missing daughter is a terrifying thought. PRISONERS did not disappoint on any front: the story, the acting, the tension. It's a movie that grips you at the beginning and doesn't let go until the end credits begin to roll. It's a dark little film that touches on the blurring of right and wrong and what is acceptable to save the life of someone you love. PRISONERS begins on Thanksgiving as the Dovers and the Birch family come together to celebrate. The youngest daughters of each family, Anna and Joy, go outside unattended and disappear without a trace. The only clue was a beaten old RV that had been seen driving around the neighborhood. Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) is assigned to locate the missing girls and the RV is traced to Alex Jones (Paul Dano), a man with the mental faculties of a ten-year-old child. Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) believes Jones knows where his daughter is being kept and, when Loki and the police aren't working fast enough, he takes matters into his own hands. He grabs Jones and locks him away in an old abandoned family home and begins his own investigation. Every minute counts as Loki and Keller race to find the missing girls before it's too late.PRISONERS is a very deliberately paced film and, at two and a half hours, you'll be surprised that at no point does it feel its length. It's a potboiler of a movie, building tension slowly so that the moments of extreme action hit you that much harder. The movie is a bit more complex than just, \"How do we make a mentally-challenged, potentially dangerous man give us information?\" Loki's investigation and the story behind the girls' abductions (as well as countless other unfortunate children before them) is almost more interesting than Keller going off on his own for his vigilante approach. The movie has the occasional red herring to throw the detective (and the audience) off course but it's never done without reason. Every person involved in the story, from the pedophile priest to the creepy stranger lurking at the girls' candlelight vigil, has some connection to the story and the people behind the disappearances. Moments that appear trivial at first are later revealed to be vital information in piecing together the over-arching story. What I'm getting at is that the movie is pleasantly complex and keeps you engaged until the screen fades to black. You never really know what to expect and you start to question how far is too far. After everything's been revealed at the end, it still leaves you wondering if all of the pain inflicted in the pursuit of saving lives was justifiable. I love that there's no right answer. What seems right at the beginning and has you gritting your teeth and silently encouraging Keller later has you looking back and thinking just how much fear can blind a person to rationality.All of this comes together with help from some great cinematography from Roger Deakins and a powerful cast. The entire movie's got a dreary, overcast feel. It's set in the winter and, when it's not pouring rain, it's a bleak gray clouded sky giving this movie not a single bright moment. It's got a strong sense of atmosphere to compliment a painful story. The cast in PRISONERS is phenomenal. Hugh Jackman breaks away from playing the X-MEN's Wolverine for a bit to portray a character with more range than cynicism and rage. That's not to say Keller doesn't have his share of rage in the film, but he sprinkles in desperation, fear, and undying determination. From the beginning of the film, we are introduced to Keller as somewhat of a religious man with a sense of preparedness for any situation. He lectures his son about how you should be prepared in the event of any catastrophe in which the rules of society might break down. Unfortunately, the one event Keller never planned for was the one in which he finds himself now and he devolves into an entirely new animal over the course of the film. Jake Gyllenhaal continues to remind me that I don't give him enough credit as an actor. His character, Loki (not the God of Mischief sort), is a skilled investigator. He's hasn't been assigned to a missing persons case that he hasn't solved. The disappearance of Anna and Joy poses his first real struggle and it's only made worse by Keller's interference. He's just a man trying to do his job and save these girls but everyone seems to be working against him. We get Maria Bello, Viola Davis, and Terrence Howard in supporting roles and Paul Dano as the mentally deficient Alex Jones. He's creepy and off-putting, but is he capable of something so horrible? The movie keeps you guessing and Dano's just great.There's not much more to say. I really enjoyed PRISONERS. I would've like to see it get more recognition but I suppose it's not surprising when you look at some of the other late year additions to the awards race. It's a great movie but doesn't compare to movies 12 YEARS A SLAVE or even American HUSTLE. It got lost in the shuffle but I hope it finds plenty of attention on home video from an audience to appreciate it.",

Success is no guarantee but it's at least a mainstream opportunity. I haven't seen Denis Villeneuve's Incendies just yet, though it's definitely on my list, but it must have been really good to grant him not only one film but two, with this years Prisoners and next years Enemy, both starring Jake Gyllenhaal. On that note, Zodiac comparisons are the first to come to mind. Not only is it a dreary world, reliably shot by Roger Deakins, but they share similar pace and structure in its very procedural method of plot delivery. Unfortunately, and again similarly, the pace is too slow. Everything it does could have been squeezed into two hours rather than two and a half. The problem is down to the editing. Its rhythm is constantly the same, feeling like it's always building and never paying off. Scenes cut away far too early and it then it jumps along the plot. Sure, I'm sure the consequences are implied, but there's the desperate need to see them. It's frustrating and impossible to feel immersed.Otherwise, I still like the plot and Hugh Jackman in particular is absolutely terrific. He's one of the most passionate actors around today and I wish he would get more high class material. Paul Dano is thoroughly great in a complex role and Viola Davis' big scene is heartbreaking. However, it's Gyllenhaal who lets the film down. Perhaps it's in the writing, but he fails to bring a human character to the table. His Detective Loki is a poor attempt at developing a three- dimensional character. He's full of contradictions. The cop who goes by his heart, by the book, by his gut. Best cop, worst cop. People person, loner. Usually contradictions bring out true character, but his lack of characterisation and conviction results in a terribly inconsistent performance. It's a shame, especially as he's getting a lot of acclaim, but I'm certainly less excited for Enemy now. He's not the only bad one of the bunch as Melissa Leo is having too much fun to be convincing. Prisoners is still a good film with a compelling moral dilemma behind it in how far a person will go for justice, that aspect is emotionally engaging. But its muddied waters doesn't help that come through.7/10",

But silly bits in the film stop this being a truly good movie. An example of this is the kid that Jackman kidnaps. He gets tortured beyond belief yet never says a word to procure his release. I know he's supposed to be 'slow' but this was too far fetched. He spoke in other scenes and he could have divulged info that would have saved him but instead he showed unrealistic mental fortitude by remaining silent. In another out-of-character moment, this 'slow' kid (and he is slow, it's not a red herring) manipulates the emotions of Jackman's friend's wife to buy him a split second of time, in which he suddenly manages to rather deftly attack her, smash a window and remove a piece of glass, intended to use as a weapon. This scene was ridiculous and showed a conniving intellect that was beyond the possibility of the character. Plus like I mention, if he can do this, why not give Jackman the answers he wanted so he can be released? There was no reason not to!There were some other issues, like why the guilty family had been doing this and how they'd got away with it so far and why the husband suddenly killed himself and why the priest never told anyone. And then there's that red herring guy who appeared to be the murderer but was just acting out from the abuse he had received from the family (which raises more questions - why did they let him go? Why did he never tell anyone?).

            "content": "The daughters of the Dovers and the Birches go missing after a Thanksgiving Day Dinner. Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) fears the police have to release Alex (Paul Dano) for lack of evidence but something Alex said to Keller leads Keller to believe Alex knows about the abduction and may have had a hand in it. He is livid. The Police are not convinced. Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) vows to find the girls.Loki? That name reminds me of the Norse God, Loki. Why use that name in here; and while we are at it the name Keller Dover doesn't exactly roll off the lips. Okay, it's out of my system. This is a good movie and it's 2 \u00bd hours long. Why so long? You will discover why when you are finished with the movie and you look back and then understand that many of the clues were a misdirection and had nothing to do with solving the case. Of course, there are good clues too, but you will decide which ones were good or bad after you walk away from this. I cannot tell you which ones were entirely used to confuse the audience. That would be telling. But, in the meantime, you are riveted to your seat because you also are trying to figure out who kidnapped the girls and where they are either dead or alive. There is some torture in here when Keller Dover kidnaps Alex because Keller is convinced Alex knows all. Keller Dover is driven and this comes out easily by Jackman as he is good at this. Detective Loki - that name again \u2013 (thought it was out of your system) goes about his business in a methodical/logical way tracking down clues as they arise. We keep waiting for that look Gyllenhaal gives when he puts a puzzle together. You know that look: his eyes widen really wide. We wait, and wait, and wait. The supporting cast of Viola Davis as Nancy Birch, Terrance Howard as Franklin Berch, Maria Bello as Grace Dover do credible jobs. Of course, Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal give outstanding performances. That's to be expected. Kudos. A shout-out must go to the make-up person who worked on Paul Dano as Alex showing the results of torture. Really scary. We cringed and felt the pain just looking at him. Good job. Again, this is still a good movie and you are ready to give it an \"A\" rating until you realize you were also kidnapped and held prisoner for 2 \u00bd hours all because of a magician's - now a director's - trick of misdirection.

The plot meandered so much that I had to read the synopsis as the story progressed. If you have a PVR and your recorded it, feel free to stop it and check other movies on cable. That's what I did. However, I did finish watching it. If this movie had been quiet throughout, it would have helped insomniacs to finally get a good night's sleep. Watching paint dry is a better alternative. One of the ironies of this film has to do with one of its producers - Mark Wahlberg. Wahlberg was one of the leads in Peter Jackson's, \"The Lovely Bones.\" Prisoners is a poor ripoff of that movie. The Lovely Bones was a superior film in every respect. Prisoners isn't a film that's worth watching more than once. The Lovely Bones is.",

The story brings basically many ethical and moral questions: what would you do to protect your family? Would you torture someone to detract information? Jackman juggles these moral queries in an emotionally gripping performance. In Keller you have the tortured father who could not protect his child. In Loki you have the guardian of a community who has sworn to protect and serve. It's not surprising to see such religiosity in a film of incredible and uncompromising darkness. Villeneuve makes everything work, with an experience stimulating on an emotional and spiritual level. Thrillers like this should be embraced. Prisoners proves compelling, thanks also to the subject matter that practically demands emotional investment from an audience: children in peril. The film's pace is an endurance test, an excessive 2 and a half hours runtime but everyone gets to share in the dread of the final revelations. Does the end justify the means? All in all it's rare to find a film that really works on all levels, but that's exactly what Denis Villeneuve's and his cast have constructed with Prisoners.",

            "content": "Children being abducted is every parent's worst nightmare. Facing such an unfavorable circumstance can be quite frightening, if not devastating. What kind of testament of a father seeking for justice against the evil doer who kidnaps his child can French-Candian director Denis Villenueve bring to this powerful whiplash of a psychological thriller? Prisoners is a movie that grabs the heart and dares not the let go while challenges viewers with moral complexities and one of the powerful jabs at \"what would you do\" circumstances. Uncompromising and packed with a brutal punch of suspense of psychological weight that is nearly impossible to resist, the film plays no game when testing the audiences' expectations and wringing out psychological elements to dare to think hard long after the end credits roll. One thing is sure, and that is Denis Villenueve shares no room for comfort or easy answers for the characters or the situation surrounding them. And that is only part of what makes this piece shine. Set during the Thanksgiving holidays, the film focuses on Keller Dover (played by Hugh Jackman) and his wife Grace (played by Mario Bello) who invite their friends Franklin (played by Terrence Howard) and Nancy Birch (played by Viola Davis) over for dinner. The families two young daughters Anna and Joy, both six-years-old, go outside to play. Before they know, the girls are nowhere to be found. Upon contacting the police, the families get help from Detective Loki (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) to search for them. Who the man ends up finding is Alex Jones (played by Paul Dano), a mentally impaired man who owns a RV the girls were climbing, and takes him into custody. Due to the lack of evidence from his mental disability, the police believe him to be innocent and let him go. Keller, however, is not buying it and decides to take matters into his own hands. This film pulls absolutely no punches when exhibiting Keller Dover's descent into vigilantism, and the moral ambiguity that almost immediately consumes him set a powerful, albeit unnerving groundwork for the testament of what extreme measures he is willing to take to get his beloved daughter back. With his eyes pinned on the only known suspect Alex Jones, Keller makes the questionable decision to take him to an abandoned house, tied him up, and tortures him in sporadic sequences that are horrifyingly realistic and difficult to watch. The psychological core rests in the questionable nature of his character to the point where you question whether we should be rooting for him or not. Even his friend Franklin is left uncomfortable by his actions. While it is not too hard to sympathize for a man who's dear flesh and blood has been taken from him, especially when the possibilities of the child's survival declines for each day he or she is not found, it is also hard to stand by his morally dubious actions. But Denis Villenueve knows how to keep things engaging at a solid cerebral level while narrowly confining away from the borders of grim exploitation. And that's including his visual method of storytelling in which is greatly assisted by cinematographer Roger Deakins who captures the simmering heat of the atmosphere with his nifty camera work. As for Hugh Jackman, his performance is definitely a home-run for an emotionally devastated thirsty for justice. Jake Gyllenhaal as Detective Loki is another great asset as well, pinning sheer humanity to a role that requires significant grit. Paul Dano, on the other hand, takes on a slightly easier role that requires very little dialogue for a character with a significantly low IQ, and his performance deserves a thumbs up.Prisoners is not always an easy watch, but that does take away from how powerful and uncompromising it is. It is an outstanding achievement by Denis Villenueve that deserves your attention, though perhaps not for those who are unwilling to take a journey through the dark pits of child abduction and vigilantism. Nonetheless, it is an engrossing experience that packs a punch.",

Aaron Guzikowski's screenplay delivers grim by the barrel-load, but also intelligence and maturity, whilst Denis Villeneuve's direction is haunting and suggestive without being manipulative or overwrought. Hugh Jackman is front and centre as Keller Dover, the distraught father who will do anything to find his abducted daughter, and he's given credible support by Maria Bello, Terrence Howard and Voila Davis, although it's Jake Gyllenhaal as the loner cop in charge of the disturbing case who is the standout. So far so good, yet there's one major drawback that stops this gritty affair being brilliant: its length. At two and a half hours long, a large chunk of its power is lost with a bloated middle act that should've had 30 minutes shaved off in the editing suite. Prisoners is a Zodiac-esque thriller that requires a strong emotional resolve, your undivided attention and a pre-movie toilet stop.",

            "content": "One of the best pieces of dramatic cinema I've seen in a long time, Prisoners is a film that will live on long after the credits roll.The term 'masterpiece' is thrown around with films too liberally, and yet, I use it so rarely that I can't recall the last time I used the word masterpiece to describe a film I watched. Prisoners is a masterpiece.After a jovial holiday feast among neighbors and friends, two families must face certain heartbreak when the two youngest daughters from each home mysteriously go missing. Keller Dover and Franklin Birch, the fathers of each girl, know the fate for missing children and the importance of time in these cases. Frustrated by stagnant police work burdened by red tape and multiple leads, they take matters into their own hands, especially Keller Dover as he grapples with crossing every moralistic line for the sake of his family and child.Prisoners is a dark film, both of subject matter and tone, so much so that I nearly did not watch the film and that would have been a grave misfortune. The mystery of Prisoners is vastly superior to its peers, leaving hints and evidence for the film to come with such sleight of hand that it is only apparent with a second viewing. For a mystery it manages to find the perfect balance of dark and brooding, complementary to the tone of the film, but is completely visually watchable.The passion and connection of these characters is complex, vital to engaging the audience and making them hope, fear, and feel with the characters. Especially notable is Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, and Paul Dano who bring depth to potentially one-dimensional characters and emit a humanity that can be found in traces in all of us.While the cast is raw, emotional and magical , the assemblage of talent would be for naught had it not been for the director Denis Villeneuve, writer Aaron Guzikowski and cinematographer Roger Deakins. The work of these three men so seamlessly blends into this fine film that it is difficult to discern where one's efforts ends and the others begins.Prisoners is a master stroke and bold statement for the future drama films that incorporate true crime and mystery.Please check out our website for full reviews of recent releases.",

Each family has two kids, a teenager and a younger daughter. The daughters are 6-year-old girls, ready to get into a harmless adventure, and the teenagers are teenagers. But the girls go missing, and the hunt goes on to find them and figure out what happened.The families have no luck and soon enough the police are there to help. The lead investigator is Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal), and the one father, Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman), already has his suspicions that he's not going to be useful at all. I think now is as good as time as any to declare that Gyllenhaal's Detective Loki is one of the most fascinating detectives to watch, and arguably one of the best performances of a detective ever. I want him on every case.Keller disagrees because he already has his prime suspect and any decent detective would torture him until he revealed the location of the missing girls. Unfortunately the prime suspect, Alex Jones (Paul Dano), is mentally disabled and likely incapable of committing such a serious crime.\"Prisoners\" is a good movie because it takes two different approaches to try to get to the same result. Keller takes matters into his own hands to track down the killer and the missing girls. And Detective Loki actively tries to solve the case. Loki is really on his own with Keller against his every move and boss which won't budge on formalities. Keller, on the other hand, shouldn't be alone with a wife who needs his support, a teenage son left to deal with a tragedy on his own, and a similarly suffering best friend. He turns from all of them but the latter to take care of the case on his own.The farther that our two active participants get in opposite directions, the more that needs to be solved. And \"Prisoners\" spends two and a half hours leading us down a twisting, suspenseful path during a bleak November in a Pennsylvanian suburb.",

Denis Villeneuve went on to Sicario and other excellent films; revisiting this now, I hoped to see what I'd missed the first time, hoping it cohered more than I remembered and that I could be more in line with the prevailing good opinion of the film.Much of those things to admire remain, especially Roger Deakins's predictably brilliant cinematography. Shot by a lesser talent, it's probable that the film's atmosphere would be considerably less brooding and uncomfortable. My problem with the central criminal's motivation remains - without descending to spoilers, such situations send at least as many in the opposite direction as they do in the general direction that the villain has gone.Hugh Jackman's performance doesn't work (it's far from subtle); Gyllenhaal is better, but his tics seem a little corny. There's little to counteract the problem of Sicario, that the central female character is underwritten; here the wives are adjuncts and those who wait for their men to do what men will do. None of this makes the film less atmospheric or detracts from the artistry; it's just that for me it's not quite the film it wants to be or that Sicario and his other later films would turn out to be.",

Convinced Loki's not doing he's job right, Keller Dover (played by Hugh Jackman) takes matters into his own hands and kidnaps Alex and torture him for information about his daughters whereabouts.The film is a 150 minute disturbing piece of work that will get to you if you have children in your life. It's a dark film that holds onto you and never lets you go. The entire time, I was thinking of my nieces and nephews and I must say, a film has never gotten to me as much as this one did. It was almost like I was in the film, living on what these people were going through, and I must say I was terrified to tears.The film had a lot of twist and turns. I suggest you don't read any spoilers, as the film is perfect without knowing what happens. Although, this is the type of film where people will probably want to check out spoilers, to know the fate of the young girls, I strongly suggest you don't.Hugh Jackman, who showed off his vocals and acting skills in Les Miserables, gives us one of the most sinister good guys characters you'll ever see. He's a very talented actor, and I feel an Oscar nomination coming his way. Who really surprised me in this film was Jake Gyllenhaal, who played Detective Loki. His character was very sympathetic to the case and I feel Jake Gyllenhaal deserves kudos for his work. He's grown into an amazing actor. I enjoyed him immensely in End Of Watch.Prisoners is one of those films you talk about after walking out of the theatre. The film is very twisted and suspenseful and I feel it's runtime was perfect for the film. Keep in mind, the film is very dark. The events that happen in this film can happen in real life, which I hated about the film, but that would be the point of the film. The film can relate to people with children in their lives and you'll just want to go home after the film and hold them. Will I ever see Prisoners again?

That's the scenario in the crime drama/thriller \"Prisoners\" (R, 2:33).When the young daughters of two neighbors go out to play after their families share Thanksgiving dinner together and then no one can find the girls, the panic is immediate and gut-wrenching. The helplessness of these two sets of parents (Hugh Jackman and Maria Bello as Keller and Grace Dover and Terrence Howard and Viola Davis as Franklin and Nancy Birch) is compounded when the police release a person of interest named Alex Jones (played brilliantly by Paul Dano) for lack of evidence. Despite the fact that Alex has the mental capacity of a 10-year-old, Keller is convinced that Alex knows something. He takes matters into his own hands and goes much farther than even the most devoted of parents could imagine. Keller is willing to do anything, and I mean ANYTHING, to extract the information he needs to find these two little girls. Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) is doing what he can to solve the case, and even seems willing to go a little outside the law to do it, but keeps coming up empty.The tension gradually but steadily builds as these parents know that time is running out for their missing children. Clues in the case are scant and hints as to where this story is going are there on the screen, but seem too trivial to matter \u2013 until they do. The plot twists and ultimate reveals are shocking, but the film's real power is in the questions it forces us to ask \u2013 and keep asking after the film is over. The script is smart enough to provide us sufficient closure to justify the emotional investment we've made in this story, but still leaves it open-ended enough to give us something to think about after the credits roll. The unusually long run time may make you feel like a prisoner, but the complex, well-directed and very well-acted story (mostly) justifies the film's length. \"B+\"",

He also did call for backup on several occasions. Anyway, it's not unusual for a det. To do what he feels necessary/on a hunch on and off the clock. Obviously, his job is his entire life and he's obsessive.The dad's an alcoholic.The dad is an ex-alcoholic (9.5 years sober) and only bought booze to throw Loki off his tail. Substance abusers often trade one obsession for another - hence his erratic behavior to find his daughter.The other parents were upset about Alex being tortured and then went along with it.Of course the other parents didn't say anything. While they were afraid of being caught, they were more concerned about getting their daughters back. Most of us would probably do the same. In the end the wife told her husband - from here on out, we know nothing and they never went back to the house.The priest story is never mentioned again.The priest is mentioned again. Loki calls his boss for an update, who told him the pedophile priest hadn't changed his story. He claimed he had no idea who the confessor was, but he had been killing children and would kill more. Feeling his own guilt, he made penance by trapping him in the basement until he died.The suicide victim story wasn't mentioned again and made no sense.Loki also followed up on the suicide victim. And at some point, he realized all of (three) the were tied together.The suicide had been kidnapped as a child and kept for 3 weeks before he escaped. He was recreating the child clothing he had seen of the children the husband and wife kidnappers had killed. He was also kept underground. The kidnapper/confesser kept snakes and wore a maze medallion. He just kept repeating/reenacting his experiences over and over again. He never got over the trauma.The parents recognized their child's clothing because he had gone into their homes and took them. He was seen in both homes. We heard the teens talking and he creeped down the hallway and then we saw him in the other home and a sock was found outside that home later when Loki out 2 and 2 together. Loki didn't take the wife's claim of an intruder seriously until much later. Not for nothing,children's clothing is mass produced. He could have found similar clothing at the used clothing store.The first little girl who was returned told the dad he was there, because she heard him downstairs. The kidnapper said she had put them in the hole after the cops came to the house. She had had them upstairs when they first showed up.The father went to the kidnapper's home unprepared.He was prepared. He had a bag and a gun. The kidnapper got the drop on him.We don't know if the dad is ever found.Sure Loki is going to look around. He was told by the mom that the little girl said she had found her whistle and it was with her when she was kidnapped and she lost it in the hole. Dad found it in the dark. It's been several days. His throat is parched and probably raw from screaming for help, he's using the whistle because he can't/if too weak to yell anymore.The movie is tense and some elements may not ring true (not being placed on suspension after the suicide), but the other things can be explained.",

The film shows you the events that happened on Hugh Jackman trying to find his children's kidnappers, and torture them to the holt until they give him the information that he wants. The film is very tense and gritty throughout, and the whole cast does brilliantly throughout the entirety of the film. This is the film that got me to notice Gyllenhaals power in Acting and dedication to his roles, it made me become a real fan of his work, and inspired me to watch him in 'Nightcrawler, Donnie Darko, Brokeback Mountain, and recently Southpaw) Gyllenhaal is a marvellous Actor with a lot to offer on screen, and his Co-Starr (Hugh Jackman) does perfectly as the devastated father in this movie. You can't help think of Jackman and think (Wolverine) from X-Men. But this film proves that he is capable of being a lot more than a hard headed mutant when it comes to Acting.

            "content": "I like the way the film doesn't beat-around-the-bush in the set-up. The \"disappearance\" comes in the first ten minutes of the film.Loads of other strengths here.The production overall is excellent. The acting across the board is fantastic. Each character has depth. I love the way the film explores the mental and physical anguish of not just the parents, but the police officer and the accused.Jake Gyllenhaal's character is a steady force in this film. We'd like to know a bit more about his background as viewers, but it's nice to see a police officer portrayed with such dignity.That said, \"Prisoners\" stand-out performance is delivered by Hugh Jackman. I'd go as far as to say it's the best performance of his career.All of the plot-nit-pickers on other reviews are obtuse... I watched the film a second time to see how the film covered it's bases, and literally everything was covered. There's nothing to nit-pick. Even the character consistencies are accurate. ANd after the re-view I'm tempted to up this to 9.LATE EDIT - I have now up'd this to 86/100 - in hind-site the film covers practically EVERY base... amazingly.Very tense film. Has a lot of moral questions to ask about victims AND police officers. The climax where Jake G is speeding in the rain is perhaps the most intense scene I've seen in years. It's incredibly well-shot. IMO the definitive moment of the film - when director and cinematographer take the build-up of the previous two hours and work it into an amazing crescendo. An absolutely AMAZING scene. The whole film paces, but the last 25 minutes is by far the best. Questions I had about Joy's escape, Alex's involvement, and the ending were clearly answered the second time around - I just missed them. SImple as that - as I suppose others did too.highly recommended. 84/100. The film isn't perfect, but it's very, very good. Not too many good thriller/drama's in 2013.. but this is rt up there with MUD, The East, Place Beyond the Pines, and Disconnect as one of the years best.You will like this if you liked:Zodiac(about even), Silence of the Lambs(about even - yea I just said it), or The Lovely Bones(not as good).",

Villeneuve crafts an immersively mysterious and thrilling experience that is pieced together from the first scene to the last, captivating the audience all throughout. Tension constantly ruminates, the clever screenplay assisted by great cinematography and editing that smoothly transitions between each moment. What makes the script great in of itself, though, is its devastatingly emotional nature that compounds with the inherent mystery at play. Proving this point, the entire cast is unbelievably convincing in their dialogue and on screen chemistry with one another. Gyllenhaal and Jackman in the lead are particular highlights as the scenes they share become increasingly heart-pounding. Their respective characters are real and therefore genuinely flawed in their own ways, both relating to an excellent theme that runs concurrent to the various meaningful ideas that arise from the investigation itself. The wonderful meaning behind the title thereafter shows itself. Not to be forgotten, however, is the spectacular and star-studded supporting cast who give their performances everything. Altogether, these factors lead to a perfectly revelatory, tense third act and a satisfactory resolution. Prisoners is a must watch for any mystery or thriller fan.",

The apparent kidnapping of two children immediately thrusts two families into a crisis in the middle of their Thanksgiving get-together. The rest of the movie deals with the fallout for families, police, neighbours, suspects, etc. and the suspense is tight enough to grip the audience until the end. The leading characters are played by Hugh Jackman, as Keller Dover, the father of one of the children, and Jake Gyllenhall, as Detective Logi, the man assigned to the case. Dover is a man of strength and ferocity who sees his purpose in life to defend and protect his wife and family from harm. When this particular crisis hits, his one objective is to rescue his daughter unharmed and nothing will stop him, even taking the law into his own hands. This leads to a some horrific scenes with the immediate suspect, a young man with a limited intelligence played by Paul Dano and his mother played by Melissa Leo. Maria Bello plays Dover's wife with Terrence Howard and Viola Davis as the parents of the second child. The detective uses every resource available to try to locate the children. Detective Loki is a low-key but determined police officer who cannot keep Keller Dover from flying into a continuous rage over the time it takes to find the kidnap victims. The final scene and ambiguous ending left a bit of a question mark. The strange sequence of events is a dark look at how people react to one horrific event but it contains elements of heroism.

            "content": "Denis Villeneuve (director of the Oscar-nominated 'Incendies') has given us one hell of a terrifying and highly suspenseful ride with his first major Hollywood film, 'Prisoners'. The movie has an amazing cast and an excellent script.It seems like almost every week, we hear a news story about a child in our neighborhood, town or city that has gone missing. The reactions and damage this causes the families feel all too real and scary in the film, which features violence and suspense that never let up.The movie begins with Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) teaching his son how to kill a deer for sport and food. It's an interesting and haunting scene. Next, Keller and his family head over to the home of their neighbors (Terrence Howard and Viola Davis) for Thanksgiving dinner. While the mothers prepare the food, the husbands talk about work and sports, the older teenagers watch TV, and the two young daughters of the families play around the house.As the Thanksgiving afternoon goes on, the two girls venture outside to play, but they never come back. The older kids noticed a creepy old mobile home parked out front during the day, and now everyone panics for the worst. The police are called, and Det. Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) takes the lead in the case. The cops soon find the mobile home a few miles away and arrest the owner, Alex Jones (Paul Dano). However, Alex has the intellect of a ten-year-old, and is released a couple days later due to lack of evidence, even though he whispers incriminating evidence about the two missing girls directly to Keller.Keller observes Alex's weird behavior and is convinced that he's responsible for the abduction. Since the police aren't doing anything about him, Keller takes matters into his own hands by kidnapping Alex and torturing him to get answers. Meanwhile, Loki pursues other leads to find the missing girls, including Alex's aunt (Melissa Leo) and a strange man obsessed with mazes.'Prisoners' is as scary and suspenseful as 'Se7en' and 'Zodiac' put together. The film draws amazing performances from Gyllenhaal and Jackman. Both men show just how far they will go for their families and jobs, even if it makes them the bad guys. Dano is terrific playing an innocent yet highly creepy guy. You never know what he has up his sleeve.Villeneuve's direction is beautiful and haunting as he takes us through the gritty and grimy underbelly of two seemingly normal families during the worst part of their lives. I have no doubt that you'll leave this movie shaken for at least a couple of days, and I won't be surprised if 'Prisoners' were to be recognized come Oscar season.",

            "content": "Prisoners is not the average thriller that some reviews and most previews build it up to be. Rather, this feature is a dramatic exploration of the darker side and evilness of humanity. Set in suburbia Kentucky, Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman), a devote family man and Christian, faces a parent's worst nightmare. His daughter goes missing. A young detective (Jake Gyllenhaal) is assigned the case, which quickly becomes nearly unsolvable as the only suspect; a RV driver with an IQ of a 10 year-old (Paul Dano) is dismissed from lack of evidence. Keller takes matters into his own hands while the small town gradually begins to fall apart and the most disturbing of secrets from behind closed doors are unveiled. I cannot say that this is a film I enjoyed. It really is not one too enjoy. It is dark and violent, but not violent in the gory sense\u2014in the realistic and psychologically one. We first hand get to see helplessly in how Keller progressively loses his soul and sanity as he continually tortures a man to desperately find any information on his missing little girl. As onlookers, we get to observe how the Dover family slips into a deep depressive state. We watch as the young cop becomes more and more flustered, agitated, and violent as he tries to close a case that he cannot fathom. Director Denis Villeneuve knows how to make the audience feel uncomfortable from depicting a mature subject matter so well and with using such a great cast. Each performance by the actors is raw and real. Hugh Jackman fits the persona of an enraged father pushed beyond his limit. We understand his motives and can accept, but not necessarily condone his brutal actions. Jake Gyllenhaal creates an interesting character that we too can feel and comprehend. He is so natural in the role. It almost seems that he is just the character and not even acting. Paul Dano plays the simpleton well, and he manages to squeeze in his trademark of embodying a whimpering wimp. None of the characters are inherently good or bad nor are they cut as black and white. They are submerged in a vat of grayness and ambivalence.Cinematographer Roger Deakins helps capture the bleak and dejecting atmosphere of the film\u2014bland, washed out colors in the day and eerie, nightmarish shadows in the night. Shot on a digital camera, the visuals are simply breathtaking. I honestly don't think this movie would have been as impactful if it had been shot on the standard 35mm film. Though sparse, the music supports the dark, foreboding mood. While the film has sublime performances and a great visual style, it falls flat on bits regarding the story. Some subplots are not finished, forcing the viewer to try and connect the dots in a somewhat intricate story. Other elements feel drawn out unnecessarily to the point of boredom. The constant transitions of fading to black during the final act comes off as a gimmick and removes any potential for suspense or energy. The ending particularly leaves the viewer cold and without solace. Then again, as previously stated, this movie is not your traditional thriller. It focuses on drama versus thrills and chills, which supports the blah atmosphere. A little of excitement though could go a long way in spicing things up for the film's concluding act. Prisoners is a film that is not fun to watch, but it is a very good one. The two and half-hour length is not something to be disheartened over. In fact, more could have been added to complete the plot in its entirety.",

I admit as a lawyer I am biased against these kind of movies where suspects are tortured beaten senseless and arrested with zero probable cause.

His role is a one-dimensional idiot without intelligence who gets it wrong from the beginning. Jake G has the worst role as stupid numbskull cop who hasn't a clue as to what is going on. I didn't give a fig about the parents, or their kids. There was zero background on what kin of parents and kids they were. This was not even a bad TV movie, it was a waste of time.

            "review_title": "The central theme of Aaron Guzikowski's script is retribution, in particular the irony of the way ordinary people are blinded by rage",
            "content": "The best aspect of Denis Villeneuve's film Prisoners are the two lead performances by Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal. Both give raw and aggressive powerhouse performances and add dramatic weight to a conventionally structured but extremely gritty 'who done it?' thriller. Jackman plays Keller, a religious and intense family man, who takes matters into his own hands when he and his neighbours Franklin (Terrence Howard) and his wife Nancy (Viola Davis) have their daughters kidnapped. Keller believes that Alex (Paul Dano), an intellectually challenged and rarely spoken individual who lives with his aunt Holly (Melissa Leo), has taken the two little girls and follows him. It is doesn't help that Alex feeds him lines of information that only fuel Jackman's rage and suspicion.The central theme of Aaron Guzikowski's script is retribution, in particular the irony of the way ordinary people are blinded by rage and in times of grief become as immoral as the initial perpetrators. Detective Loki (Gyllenhaal) is pressed with a near irresolvable duality: he has to prove to himself that he can solve this case, he's apparently never failed to solve one before, but also has to watch Keller closely because of his increasingly irrational and violent behaviour. He's solving one case and then preparing for another one to unfold before it even happens. Gyllenhaal makes for an incredibly resilient and determined cop, skilfully layering his character with different sides to his personality, including intimidation tactics against suspects, to care and sincerity when he promises Keller's wife Grace (Maria Bello) that he'll find their daughter. The intensity and power in this performance is so strong that it overcomes the disappointment of the non-backstory of the character. Hugh Jackman has played aggressive characters before, mainly Wolverine, but unlike his X-Men role his character doesn't have the same nobility. Keller is a vigilante and a drunk and more of a psycho than a samurai. The amount of dramatic fury and verbal rage in this performance is startling and seemingly difficult to rein in at times. Taking action into his own hands, he resorts to kidnapping and torture for answers that may not even exist. The film opens with the Our Father prayer, which gains meaning because in the scenes of torture Keller's anger prevents him from forgiving 'those who trespass against us'. In an unrelentingly grim film, sometimes heavy-handed in its mood and tone, the torture scenes verge on being over the top. These are truly horrific, ugly moments, so disturbing that they're almost unwatchable in their violent confrontations. Inevitably, the extremity of Keller's actions diminishes a lot of our sympathy for his character and the case. Arguably, the torture scenes are not included just for pure sadism. As well as retribution Villenuve is concerned with the way that people are entrapped by their perceptions of the truth and how much faith they have in their own beliefs. Reflecting this notion is the beautiful, largely static camera-work by cinematographer Roger Deakins (superb work again after True Grit), who frames the interiors of this rather muted and drab setting in a way that it makes the characters appear like prisoners of their own personal values and motives. The editing is also patient, providing time for the actors to inhabit their characters in medium close-up shots. It's a shame though that some of the side actors like Maria Bello and Viola Davis have very few scenes written where they can truly utilise their talents. There is still great suspense built through the film though and its most effective, not when it's violent, but when it forges a sense of unseen, foreboding danger preparing to intrude on the characters. The narrative of Prisoners is structured like a police procedural and it's extremely complex when accounting for a number of subplots that feed into the main crime. The film is very long, running at two and a half hours, and some of the more ambiguous aspects of the plot feel hurried, including a book with a maze that involves a copycat suspect. A second viewing might tie a lot of these elements together more neatly. Given the unpleasantness of this film, I'm not sure it's something I have any desire to see again. Despite the convoluted threads and the film's substantial efforts to blur the lines of morality, there are still very conventional mystery beats followed here, meaning you will be waiting right till the end for any revelations and for the police to notice that one key clue. Although I had trouble connecting all the dots of the plot, the very end is thankfully an excellent final scene. It echoes the film's central concept: we are all eventually captives of our actions and the systems of law emplaced by society or the people who think they know better.",

Films of this pace draw a fine line...films that are slower but have an excellent story that immerse you, and films that are slower and boring. Thankfully, Prisoners is one of the former. It's 2\u00bd hours long, but in all honesty if it was any shorter it wouldn't have done the story any justice at all as it would have been rushed and so many story lines wouldn't have been answered.Everything about this movie is really well done, and the cast do a great job of making a great story better, with one of the stand-outs being Hugh Jackman who plays Keller Dover, an ordinary husband & father who becomes obsessed with getting his daughter back no matter what it takes.The film takes you on a route that has many different twists and turns and poses so many thought provoking questions, with the main one being how far would you go if it were your child? Prisoners is a great movie and you'd be doing well to find a better crime thriller to watch this year. Highly recommended.",

            "content": "Prisoners is a simple enough film to follow. When two little girls go missing and are believed to have been kidnapped, one of their father's -- portrayed by a gruff Hugh Jackman -- takes the law into his own hands, torturing the prime suspect when the police can't charge him with anything. This is a film that asks many moral questions, most notably -- What would you do if this happened to you? While I'd like to think most fathers wouldn't go to the extremes Jackman's character does, I don't know if I'd blame someone either for doing what he does in this film. I think that's why so many in the cast seem to relate to this material, and it shows in their performances, which are all strong, in particular a near mute Paul Dano as the prime suspect with a shattered psyche. Ultimately, though, while Prisoners offers some rich, complex characters, the lack of any levity, as well as the more, \"been there, done that,\" procedural elements of the story, really make this a long watch. We can see much of what Prisoners has to offer, in particular the detective aspects of hunting down the kidnapper, by staying at home and watching an episode of Law & Order in one-third of the time. Perhaps the film would have been stronger had it focused entirely on Jackman torturing Dano's character? Sure, there would have never been any levity in that scenario either, but at least it would have made for a more tight and concise story that would have been different and justified why this had to be a film and not just an episode of a TV show.I give Prisoners an 8 out of 10!",

With the Madeleine McCann abduction back in the news, PRISONERS has a special resonance for UK audiences, but this is the nightmare that every parent dreads waking up to.",

            "content": "Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK) Rating: 4.1/5 starsAn edge-of-the-seat thriller in the truest sense of the term. You'll keep guessing right till the end and will never be able to see the shocking plot twists coming. Credit needs to be bestowed upon the Director and script writer. Supplementing their vision to great effect are the superlative skills amply displayed by the editor and cinematographer. What we get is a tense, somber, atmosphere with palpable tension and despair.And finally down to the performances. \"Prisoners\" boasts of an ensemble cast and boy do they deliver the goods. Viola Davis and Terrence Howard bring a sense of grit and fortitude to the hopelessness they face in their concise roles, while Maria Bello is a picture of grief in her limited screen time. Paul Dano is a past master at playing complex characters and he pulls of yet another winner. Melissa Leo was all but unrecognizable until you realize it was her once the credits start rolling. Jake Gyllenhaal delivers a sound and assured performance meriting an Oscar nomination in the supporting category.But it's Hugh Jackman who acts the hell out of his portrayal of a desperate father driven to a frantic edge. It is without question the best performance of his career and so far the performance of the year too. I think the best accolade that can be give to this fine actor is that his act in \"Prisoners\" literally makes us forget his iconic role of \"Wolverine\" in the \"X-Men\" series and spin-offs.Along with being a nail-biting ride from start to finish, \"Prisoners\" also succeeds in being an emotional roller-coaster and even involves the viewers by making us relate to the moral ambiguity of the protagonists, and the lengths to which they are willing to go to save a loved one.",

            "content": "Over the weekend I decided to pop into the movies again, this time I went to see Prisoners. The moment I saw this trailer I knew it had potential to be a great movie. The cast is star-studded with Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Terrence Howard and Maria Bello. Well with all that being said lets dive right into the 9 things I liked and didn't like about Prisoners.http://thesportsscript.com/2013/09/24/prisoners-movie-review/1. Denis Villeneuve was the director of this film and I had previously never even heard of the guy, which was kind of scary because this movie looked good but the thought of a director whose never really done a big style film was concerning.But Villeneuve nailed it; from start to finish he kept you on the edge of your seat and kept you guessing throughout the movie. The pain and anguish you felt for this family was heartbreaking, you couldn't help but want to see this family get his retribution.2. This movie had a great story (Aaron Guzikowski penned this). They made you care about the characters, they didn't make you feel dumb by any means and they even got you to feel for Alex Jones (Paul Dano) which that in itself was amazing. Guzikowski has a sick mind for sure to write this movie but the writing on this was just brilliant and the fact that Villeneuve was able to translate that to the big screen so well was great.3. Hugh Jackman: It doesn't get bigger than Jackman. He is a star and he showed why in this movie. He played an intense, caring and fight to the death father that just wanted his daughter back. You slowly watch Keller Dover (Jackman) transform from a concerned father into a guy that was willing to do anything to find his daughter. A lot of people said \"Oscar talk\" before this and I was like that is a big statement to make but as of right now Jackman has to be a front-runner for Best Actor.4. Jake Gyllenhaal: Jake is easily one of my favorite actors, he has played in some really god movies over the past few years (End of Watch, Source Code & Brothers). He rivaled Jackman with his performance in this. He played Detective Loki, who was in charge of finding these little girls and knocked it out of the park.5. Paul Dano: Dano was on the big screen with some big stars in this and held his own just fine. The way he portrayed Alex Jones, a timid scared and very creepy adult that wasn't all there, he nailed it. His character was written so well that you couldn't help but feel for him towards the end of the film.6. The rest of the cast: Terrence Howard, Maria Bello, Viola Davis & others. Perfect casting for this film, Howard was great for this role and was interesting to see his character (Franklin Birch) turn into the guy that Kellen Dover wanted him to be and not who he thought he should be. Viola Davis didn't have too much screen time but one scene in particular she was amazing. I won't spoil it, you will just know whenever you see it. I think the Grace Dover character was made for Maria Bello and nobody else. A movie is only as good as its cast and this showed it.7. The emotion: I am a huge movie guy and will give just about any movie at least one shot. But the bad thing is seeing so many movies you find it hard to care about characters. Only really good movies get me to care and this was one of them. I was emotionally invested into each role; though it was a tad long they still kept the movie going at a steady pace. Whether it was Dover (Jackman) just beating Jones (Dano) into a bloody pulp or Grace (Bello) just crawled into a ball on a bed crying missing her kid, you felt what they felt. That is what makes a great movie and boy was this a damn good movie.8. Kept you guessing: I love a movie where you sit through the movie and just keep trying to guess who is the killer or who is this or that. This was that movie; I was sitting there next to my brother and just trying to figure out where they were going with the movie. I would think it was going to go right and they hooked a left 4 streets before that right. They led you to believe many different things and none of which really came to fruition.9. The payoff: I refuse to spoil any of the ending for you guys but what a freaking ending. (That is all I will say about that) If you have seen this movie, please leave a comment below on your thoughts on the ending. Would love to hear what people thought of it.The Verdict:5 out of 5 starsVilleneuve & Guzikowski teamed up to bring what I think is a top 5 movie of the year so far, actually might be the best movie I've seen this year. Just a fun thrilling ride start to finish that keeps you guessing at every turn. Two Oscar worthy performances by Jackman and Gyllenhaal, a supporting cast and an amazing movie that will keep you talking about it for days.http://thesportsscript.com/2013/09/24/prisoners-movie-review/",

But the movie loses too much time trying to develop a plot and characters that ultimately are quite shallow.A lot of scenes are very conventional and don't help broaden the perspective, and you even sense some hesitation on the writing at the end especially regarding the false leads which are not properly integrated and seem to serve no purpose whatsoever.As the movie progresses and the outcome unfolds, you begin to realise the banality of the story, its lack of impact and depth on every level.It is therefore a nice package but that sounds a bit empty, you don't end up overwhelmed after watching Prisoners, far from it, it's actually more of a certain disappointment that emerges considering there was better to do with these elements.",

            "review_title": "Enthralling, shocking, exciting, it tugs heartstrings, prompts inner rage & questions one's scruples.",
            "content": "The trailer for Prisoners is yet another example of Hollywood giving far too much away. Usually it implies a poor film with the funniest/most shocking moments spliced together because the distributors know the film is substandard and are terrified the film will bomb. So why on earth did they feel the need to give away so much in the Prisoners trailer? Prisoners is just a few plot holes away from being a ten star film. It is enthralling, shocking, exciting, it tugs heartstrings, it prompts inner rage, it questions one's scruples, it is the cause of much thought and heated discussions. Prisoners is a very fine film indeed and the best thriller we've seen on the big screen for many months. The summer blockbuster period is officially over and cinema just got down and dirty again! Keller and Grace Dover (Hugh Jackman and Maria Bello) and their children join friends Franklin and Nancy Birch (Terrence Howard and Viola Davis) for Thanksgiving. After lunch the parents do their thing, the two older children escape to the basement and the two youngest, Anna Dover (Erin Gerasimovich) and Joy Birch (Kyla Drew Simmons) head out to the quiet road to play. When they don't return, abduction is assumed and panic and suspicion set in. The cops are called, headed by Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal), and the finger is pointed directly at Alex Jones (Paul Dano). When the police release Jones due to a complete lack of evidence, Keller declares him guilty and takes matters into his own hands.Prisoners kicks into full thriller mode from the outset. The tension is ramped up with finely directed early scenes and a subtle score (from J\u00f3hann J\u00f3hannsson). Though it occasionally stutters, the obvious 'jump' in the basement failing miserably (fortunately!), it picks at the nerves for the full two-hour plus running time. It's not a film that makes the viewer leap out of one's skin, but niggles unpleasantly as it ask multiple questions: Is he/isn't he guilty? What happened? What does it mean? Does the end justify the means? How far is too far? What would YOU do to protect your children? Director Denis Villeneuve (Incendies) has cleverly stitched together a film that is often too close to reality for comfort and looks at issues that fill our newspapers. Take the case of Keith Bennett, the Moors Murderers' fourth victim. His body was never recovered and his mother died without being able to bury her son. Given the opportunity, would she have been justified in having a week alone the Myra Hindley and Liam Brady to find the truth of his whereabouts? The ordeal suffered by Christopher Jefferies, vilified and proclaimed guilty by the press and public, simply for looking 'odd', is also too fresh in our minds to be ignored as we watch Jones' suffering. Subtler is the prospect of ambiguity; just as Derek Bentley was hanged for his equivocal cry of \"Let him have it!\", does the alleged utterance from Jones, \"They only cried when I left them.\" have only one interpretation? The performances throughout Prisoners are from the top drawer, and the actors have been gifted realistically written roles. The four parents have not merely been crafted to satisfy a particular stereotypical reaction, rather we are presented with understandable reactions. In Keller it is a desperate rage at his own impotence to protect his family and Jackman is flawless in his violence and despair. His actions are never acceptable but the way Keller is written and performed allows us to care deeply and consequently I'm sure there are many, many viewers who would turn a blind eye or even outwardly condone his methods.Though Jackman's Keller is the showier role here, Howard gives a very measured performance as the other father who has a firmer grasp of his morals though still floundering at the loss of his daughter. Equally, Bello's Grace is perhaps even easier to identify with as she crumples and enters a voluntary stasis, unable even to shower and change let alone control her emotions. Bello depicts a mother so distraught her ability to function abandons her.Davis is short changed; her Nancy brings a steely decisiveness to the table but she is given too little screen time for us to fully engage with. Gyllenhaal is the solid character in Prisoners that we can look to for balance. We don't really see what makes him tick but that is a plus point here; how many detectives arrive on the scene with the life stories laid out for us? Loki is there to do a job, solve a crime and remain as emotionally detached as possible. It is a creditable performance to add to Gyllenhaal's every-growing list.Unsurprisingly, Dano is excellent as the 'freak' who clearly 'must' be dangerous simply by dint of looking odd and being educationally subnormal. Dano has few peers in Hollywood and has cornered the market in oddball roles and there's a very good reason why: He's superb. Likewise, Melissa Leo as Jones' aunt, Holly, is perfect. Leo is a true chameleon of the screen. Enough said. Just watch her.Post-film, my companion for the evening and I debated heatedly the moral issues and how many parents may stoop to such extreme measures given cause. We agreed to differ though the questions remain. Our agreement was entire regarding the quality of Prisoners as a film, however. I can't mention the flaws without destroying the film but there are unresolved matters, unrealistic scenarios and lazy devices that keep Prisoners short of perfection. But it remains a very powerful film that, if it's intention is to leave the viewer wondering what kind of man/woman they are, succeeds admirably.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",

To call the mystery in the film's story griping, attention-holding and pulse raising is to sell it lightly because this movie grabbed me by the jugular and didn't let go until it was over.

Add in the fact that there was tremendous performances from literally every actor and actress that was in the cast and you have a formula for a movie that didn't disappoint me in the entertainment department.The only real downside is the fact I don't think there's much replay value in the movie because I don't think the impact the ending and story had on me will be the same as it was during the first time around.

The cast are excellent so much so that my wife has now gone from liking Hugh Jackman to seeing him as some sort of mad rampaging bully, perhaps that's more to do with his treatment of Paul Dano who she has a soft spot for. It isn't Jake Gyllenhalls finest film much preferred him in end of watch but it is a solid performance. Paul Dano is excellent in his portrayal of the prime suspect & the film builds up a true sense of menace & suspense leading to its conclusion. The miserable setting a weather adds to the undoubted despair of the characters & the direction is solid. If I have to add one criticism its that the film is 30 minutes longer than it needs to be which leads to a feeling of this is being dragged out for the sake of it.

It creeps up on you, slowly, like the speed of the film, it also moves slowly almost to calm you down and keep you relaxed yet very aware of what is going on and look closely at the events unfolding before you. The film is almost two and a half hour long, but in my mind it never seemed that way, it didn't get boring or trivial, it kept the suspense all the way through.If you have kids (I do), this is kind of the worst thing that could happen, what would you do, how would you react. The people in the film is just as different as you and me, they react differently, they get frustrated, they lunch out and to sum it up they do what they think is the right thing to do at the time, they do what they feel they have to do to get back what is taken from them.This is powerful acting, very believable and real, the characters and how they react, the way they go up and down, high on emotions, fueled by rage and frustrations. The choices they make and the solutions they choose individually affects the dynamic of their bonds, both family and friendship bonds a tried and tried hard. On the way the whole mood of the film and characters change, both by frustrations, lack of sleep, the lack of ability to go something about their situation. It is staggering and adds to the suspense and dark setting the film uncovers.I will not reveal anything about the movie itself, but if you have the stomach for abduction, skewed morals, the harsh facts of life and a very raw setting, if you can handle that (it is just a movie), then this is the film for you.

This makes Loki's treadmill journey more interesting within the film's contained, claustrophobic atmosphere forcing our withered hero to feel as captivated, or rather, captured as Paul Dano's Alex Jones, a simple-minded young man that Keller holds hostage, resulting in bouts of grueling torture to get answers for his daughter's vanishing.While there are an abundance of red-herrings to distract Loki (and the audience) from the real culprit, prolonging a two-and-a-half hour melodrama that could have fit in a more fashionable two, and many of the side-characters eventually become peripheral and insignificant, the intensely sparse performances of Jackman and Gyllenhaal exceed the villain- revealing/monologue-spouting climax, resulting in yet another (semi) ambiguous ending: only this time it doesn't seem artsy or pretentious.",

            "content": "At first glance, I would have pegged Prisoners as a dull, run-of-the-mill drama. It may take a few minutes to gain momentum, but once it does, this film becomes a rather bleak and gripping descent into a prison of desperation and despair.The overall tone, style, and pacing of the film strikes a perfect balance, much akin to films like Zodiac, Silence of the Lambs, or Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. Prisoners is every bit as dark and moody as these films. It also handles the brutal violence with just the right level of skill and effectiveness; it rarely lingers on graphic details, but it is still hard-hitting. The experience overall is mesmerizing and emotionally taut.The story covers familiar ground, for there are plenty of films, books, and TV shows that focus on missing persons and kidnapped children. Prisoners excels at telling this simple story, however, because it emphasizes the emotional despair of the case, and it feels all the more real because of it. In spite of that, it maintains a perfect level of pathos, allowing the audience to connect to the characters and really feel for them (including both the parents of the victims, who go to any length to find their children, and the cops, who want to do their jobs but inevitably clash with the parents). The conflict shifts in some surprising directions, and it becomes apparent that the real prisoners of this story are not necessarily the kidnapped victims. After a number of twists and turns, it all leads to a starkly bittersweet ending.This film uses some simple, but highly effective, photography and editing. Lighting can be very dark and drab, lending the film a perfect look and style to accentuate the tone. Acting is what really propels this film above-and-beyond though, thanks to a surprisingly emotional and nuanced performance by Hugh Jackman, and an earnest portrayal from Jake Gyllenhaal. Everybody else pulls their weight really well. Writing is good. This production uses good-looking sets, props, and costumes. Music is appropriate as well.Prisoners is a dark and bleak mystery thriller that mesmerizes and hits hard, on a level not too far off from Zodiac or Silence of the Lambs. If you enjoy these types of thrillers, then this film is a must-see.4.5/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Very Good | Film: Perfect)",

            "content": "This was an outstanding movie. One of the most thought provoking films to date since The usual suspects. A man or men lose their daughters during thanksgiving. The only clue to go on was an RV which was parked out front of a building where Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) daughter went missing along with her friend Joy. Now the police are on the case to find the missing girls as soon as possible. Yet within the mix of the case, a lone man who drove the RV is suspect by Dover, and also detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal). This man Alex (Paul Dano) however is more than he seemed, for it was learnt later by Dover from his aunt that he too was an abducted person. But for all of his attempts to warn Dover, and others in where to find the girls he is subject to Dover'sown justice with a five day beating spree. Convinced that Alex was the abductor, he used methods only a dark human could come up with. As with Dover's conclusions he came to realize from a few clues of his own and also Joy who was found wandering by herself that Alex's aunt was completely responsible for it all. Now faced with a new dilemma Dover is subject to his own prison under the aunts pavement where she kept the girls. I have to say this movie was well done, lots of twists, turns, pointing fingers, and deceit. This goes to show what and how far a human could actually go to save their family no matter the cost or outcome. The music was top notch, very full of impact. Emotions running high, as well as seeing how low a person can go to fetter their disposition against overwhelming odds. Hugh Jackman played an excellent example of just what length a father will stoop to finding his little girl. Even beating to near death poor Alex who didn't even know it happened at all. I highly recommend this to those over 18. It is gritty, full of dark purposes, and dangerous emotions. What did intrigue me through out the film was the odd man out who sought his own adventure by being a surreal puzzle man, (David Dastmalchian). Someone who thought using tools to makeshift himself as a serial killer. Yet shooting himself was the key to letting me know it was not him. No serial killer does that in the face of infamy. Very well done.",

In addition, it composes a somewhat slow rhythm but full of intense emotions that makes you empathize and understand the characters present. In this movie you can also appreciate the performances of the actors so involved in the character they play, since the emotions they convey with their actions are very realistic and dramatic at the same time, which makes you feel the anguish or sadness they feel. As the film progresses, it leaves you clues about the culprit of the main event, and although the outcome of the plot surprises you, the point of the film is not exactly that, what the film seeks is precision in the writing of the complete story, which makes the whole film a great cinematic demonstration of pure suspense. And although the ending may be a bit unfinished with what will happen next, that is the essence of the film, to have an ending that, as the title itself says, keeps you intrigued/suspicious, allowing the viewer to make a voluntary interpretation of the events to come.I definitely recommend this movie for all the good lovers of crime, drama and mistery movie genre.",

            "content": "Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman), his wife Grace (Maria Bello), and two children enjoy a nice Thanksgiving dinner at the house of their rural and friendly neighbors, the Birches (Franklin = Terrence Howard, Nancy = Viola Davis, and two children). After the meal the two younger girls of each family \u2013 6 year-old Anna Keller (Erin Garasimovich) and 7 year-old Joy Birch (Kyla-Drew) \u2013 go outside to play. When they do not return, the two families conduct a fruitless search. The only clue is an old and unfamiliar RV that was parked nearby. Police are called. Dining alone in a restaurant, Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) is summoned. While the police are searching, they spot the RV parked close by. The creepy, spectacled driver, Alex Jones (Paul Dano), sees them and tries to flee but smashes his vehicle. When Alex is taken to a police station, it is soon discovered that he is none too bright; in fact, his IQ is that of a 10 year-old. On his own he could never have staged the crime and has few facts to provide. His aunt Holly Jones (Melissa Leo) provides limited details, saying that Alex has never been in trouble. Forensics on the RV reveals no information about the two missing girls. Area searches reveal nothing. As the girls are not found, tension obviously develops between the Dovers and Loki, who does his best. Checking a clue listing, Loki goes to the house of a defrocked and alcoholic priest, Father Patrick Dunn (Len Cariou). Loki discovers a mummified body in the basement with a circle maze medal necklace. Father Dunn says that he doesn't know anything about the man except that he had confessed to murdering 16 children, and threatened more harm. To save the children, the priest lured the man to his residence and dispatched him. Loki arrests the ex-priest. When Loki visits the Jones' house, Alex remains quiet.When Alex is released for insufficient evidence, Keller is so furious that he physically attacks him in the parking lot outside the police station. Alex says, \"They didn't cry until I left them.\" No one else hears this comment. Keller is arrested but quickly released. When Grace emotionally collapses, Keller takes the law into his own hands by kidnapping Alex, holding him hostage, and driving him to an old, abandoned apartment building that his father once owned. At first Alex is tied to a radiator. Later he is restrained inside a plywood-wall (around a shower) that Keller has constructed. (Keller is a self-employed contractor engaging in home remodeling and repairing.) When Keller shows Franklin what he has done, the latter is mortified. But Keller is so desperate that he continues to beat on Alex for information. Meanwhile the mummified corpse remains unidentified by the police. When a candlelight vigil for the two missing girls is held by neighbors, Detective Loki spots a shadowy character who manages to escape after a foot chase. But Loki has garnered enough information to have a sketch made of the suspect. The real break occurs after a young saleslady at a children's discount outlet recognizes the sketch on TV. She tells Loki that the strange man shops weekly for variously-sized children's clothing. She has no other detail, but later calls Loki to say that the suspect returned, and she has his license plate number. Loki tracks down the stranger, Bob Taylor (David Dastmalchian). He is shortly arrested while bloodied children's clothing is found at his residence. At first it appears that Taylor has murdered the girls. In confinement at the station, he is asked to draw a map of the girls' whereabouts, but draws a circle maze instead. Then, in a bizarre confrontation, Taylor grabs a police gun and kills himself. Loki was not over his disappointment when the lab calls to say that only pigs' blood was found on the girls' clothing. Taylor was not a murderer, just a copycat. (While Taylor was alive he had sneaked into the Dover residence and stolen some clothing.) Meanwhile Keller is still working on Alex, and when he sees him next Alex says that the two girls are \"in a maze.\" By the way, doesn't Alex at least know right from wrong? Anyway, Keller again visits Holly, who discloses some background involving Alex. WARNING: SPOILERS AHEADJoy Birch is found alive in a drugged state after she had inexplicably escaped. When Keller addresses her in the hospital, Joy responds, \"You were there.\" Keller dashes away and drives to Holly's. Loki also leaves, but drives to the abandoned building instead. Keller tells Holly that he now knows that the missing girls were there. She whips out a gun and makes him drink a sedative concoction. Holly states that after her son died of cancer she and her now-missing husband (killed by Dunn) waged a war against God by kidnapping children and killing them. They abducted Alex, whose real name is Barry Millard. These actions were meant to turn parents into demons, as Keller is. Holly forces him to enter into a deep hole where Anna had been kept and covers it. Keller finds Anna's red emergency whistle. Loki is ordered to visit Holly and explain that Alex has been found. As he arrives Holly is absorbed in applying a deadly hypodermic needle into unconscious Anna's arm. Before she does so, she wheels about and wounds Loki in the head; he shoots and kills her. In a mad rush, the embattled detective drives Anna to the hospital in time. The next scene shows Loki recovering on a hospital bed and reading a newspaper headline that Alex has been reunited with his family after 26 years. Keller is still missing.While a supervised team is excavating the Jones property for bodies, Loki hears the sound of an emergency whistle emanating from the hole where Keller is confined. The credits appear. In summary, despite plot holes, this is an entertaining movie with good acting.",

            "content": "An intricate plot keeps this drama interesting for a film that almost seems to be preying on every parent's worst fear, that their children will be abducted. It's tense, has several brutally tough moments, and it's tough to guess exactly where it's going. I liked the intensity of the performances as well as the filming location, which takes us to this small town, though I was surprised it was done in Georgia instead of Pennsylvania, where the story is set.My reservations were around the film feeling a little too Hollywood, if that makes any sense. The details in the setup invariably factoring in, the vigilante dad, the black neighbors present but subordinate, and the cop who repeatedly breaks the law in how he pursues the case leading up to the big, canned moments towards the end - it all feels a little produced. It was also hard for me to like the out of control behavior from the dad and cop (Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal) given all the things they do. That's of course one of the points, that anger and frustration can turn people into demons, but the film wants it both ways, with the cop being a hero and the father really being a good guy at heart, praying to God often, and just doing everything he can for his kids. It should have picked one side or the other, and probably should have been pared down as well. It's entertaining if you're looking for a wild ride and a good popcorn drama, but just kind of standard stuff, and could have been better.",

It's a Dark disturbing movie that drips with atmosphere from almost the very beginning. Each of the ensemble cast is terrific and is or ends up being a prisoner in some way whether it be to grief,morality,fear etc. Jackman has never been better and his wife's cries of him not being able to be the protector she thought he was really sets him in motion to do everything in his power to do just that. He does what he thinks the law is not doing and puts his morality aside and becomes a vigilante and while disturbing, has you question what you might do in those circumstances. Gyllenhaal is excellent as well and brings several layers of method acting to bring Lokki to life as a determined overworked and somewhat quirky detective who works tirelessly to find the missing girls. The Puzzle pieces are set in place and there are a few red herrings as well that will leave you enthralled to the very end. The ending was perfect in my opinion and begs the question are you glass full or half empty. Keller Dover's dream of his daughter gives him a lifeline and Lokkis determination give a sliver of a chance at a happy outcome or is the maze unsolvable like book. Hauntingly perfect.",

            "content": "At first glance, this film will strike many people as a typical Hollywood revenge film resembling the likes of Death Wish and Payback. However, that is furthest from the truth. Prisoners packs one hell of a punch, giving the audience not only something very entertaining, but also something very human in the process. The film plays out more like Seven, Zodiac and Mystic River, allowing the audience inside the mind of Keller Dover, a man searching for his daughter while teetering on the brink of insanity. The story kicks off when the Dover and Birch families are celebrating Thanksgiving. What seems like a normative celebration quickly descends into a frantic search for two young girls. Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal)arrives at the Dover house after the abduction and soon finds a suspect in Paul Dano's character. But as time passes without finding the girls, Dano is finally let go. Much to his dismay, Keller Dover takes matters into his own hands and kidnaps the suspect, subjecting him to brutal torturous methods as he searches for the truth in finding his daughter. What makes Prisoners so well crafted is the performances from Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal, both of whom are at the top of their game in this film. The chemistry between these two actors is impeccable, bringing a natural presence to the screen. The supporting cast, including an unrecognizable Melissa Leo, is superb. Viola David, Maria Bello and Paul Dano also give caliber performances, and keep the film entertaining just on their performances alone.The story keeps moving and moving and never slows up despite a two and a half hour running time. While that seems like a deterrent nowadays for most audiences, this film is good enough for anyone to sit through happily and be able to walk out of the theater satisfied with the final product. This is a heavy hitting movie that Hollywood very seldom makes. It is rooted in classic revenge films from the golden age of Hollywood while introducing new style and substance, making for a truly intriguing watch.If there's any film that you should see right now, trust me, it is most definitely Prisoners.",

Also liked, in a lesser extent, Hugh Jackman. His character is the most layered though.I also really liked one of the key components of this film that was the cinematography. Cold, dark with a 'modern' touch, all the artistic method used by the great Roger Deakins. The editing was also well-done, as we see in the final moments in the film.I wished I could've felt more the sounds of the ambient though. Everything was beautifully well made, well crafted, lacking a good job in the music/sound department. The score was way generic.Anyway...Prisoners is a very well crafted and an exciting thriller, undeniable one of the best released recently. 8.5/10",

Sharp dialogue, slow but engaging pace, and beautiful cinematography courtesy of longtime collaborator Roger Deacons all mix to form excellent and unique moviegoing experiences from every single one of his movies. Prisoners is no exception. \nWhile I may have had the misfortune of having to watch this movie over the course of two nights, this movie was still one of the most engaging and haunting films I've seen. Everyone involved with this movie brought fourth their A-game, especially Jake Gyllenhaal and Hugh Jackman, both of whom delivered phenomenal and when needed, explosive performances. The supporting cast does an excellent job as well, especially Viola Davis and Paul Dano. \nThe acting is not the only noteworthy part of Prisoners, as Deacon's unique style of camerawork lends itself masterfully to the bleak and hopeless tone, and keeps viewers engaged and attentive towards subtle details in every scene. \nI could go on and list everything I adored about this movie, but the best way to convey to you why this film is a masterpiece is for you to go and watch it yourself. 9.5/10",

Just an ultra-realistic, riveting film that will not end up exactly as you think it will. Nice use of subtle clues in the random bits of dialogue, written notes, and newspaper flashes.A number of sociological and religious themes can be delved from PRISONERS: How the families, police, perpetrators, and community-at-large are all made \"prisoners\" by this event; the dangers of preconceived notions about who, why, and how the crime was committed, etc. At the same time, it doesn't just bombard us with deep ulterior meanings, and those who prefer to watch it as a simple \"thriller\" may easily do so. Really fine all-around acting: Jake Gyllenhaal and Melissa Leo give especially commendable performances.",

Scriptwriters have chosen to have two main characters: Jackman as the father and Gyllenhaal as the detective. Since the film's structure is dramatic instead of thematic (in which case the script should focus mainly on the relationship of two characters) this could seem a bit of problem for the audience to get into the movie. Although this is not the case thanks to the common goal of the characters: Finding the girls. And surprisingly having two main characters is one of the aspects which makes this film different from its similars. Yet one can't help but thinking \"How would it have been with just one main character?\". Prisoner was near excellent until a certain point but unfortunately it falls short to greatness just before its ending. That certain point is being the moment that the father runs away from the hospital to Jones' residence. The very obvious inconsistencies were:1) Keller's idiotic off-guard approach to Jones's house. 2) Aunt Jones' hurry to kill the girl instead of first facing the detective at the door and sending him out.I would have given this film a 9 without these flaws. Still, the best film I've seen in a period.",

And NO the movie doesn't automatically stir you in the right direction. It shows things that look important, but aren't. The police mainly looks at unimportant stuff and it makes it so frustrating!To start: normally a movie explains the story, this movie doesn't, the camera is 'just' an eye, watching a story developing in front of it. In combination with the brilliant acting, a master class Stanislavski, it gets a tremendous realistic feel. Just this will bother you later on in the movie, because maybe you don't like what you see. It places you in amoral situations, but the movie doesn't judge what you see (the camera is just an eye, watching). The movie plays with the audience, so if you are the average movie watcher and you like movies straight forward, maybe this isn't the one for you.It doesn't want to explain everything, and I believe that's good. PLZ!!! Stop with the movies that go and explain minor plots, like we don't have any brain that understand and figure out. Start with: USE YOUR IMAGINATION! (sorry). There are some movies that do a very good job in leaving the audience with a 'what the f?'example: Inception. Does the whirl fall???? they don't show, so maybe instead of talking about the little twitch it made in the end, the movie suggests that you have to search somewhere else. CGI everywhere just to keep your eyes from seeing that small detail that explains EVERYTHING, just for the close watcher. LOVELY.This movie overloads you with false clues, raises so many questions, that you miss the important details. And if you follow closely, you'll figure it out before the big: SO THAT'S THE ONE!8.6, so a 9 starsPs. the movie breaks many clich\u00e9's. While (real)life is filled with clich\u00e9's. So how people say that this movies (with it's scary realistic vibe) was filled with the same old, I can't understand. If it wasn't it would be a more fantastic movie, which wouldn't make it much better, definitely not as realistic. A Master Piece, and luckily most people where able to keep their attention, to notice it.Pss. for the people that found Loki story unrealistic... talk to a cob. *MINOR SPOILER*: Would you move the fridge?

            "content": "A movie that is, in my humble opinion, toeing the line between So-so and bad? What happened to audiences today? Have you all lost your minds? Is the government already succeeding at dumbing-down the masses? OK, sure, the performances were solid. But what I saw in the end was great talent wasted on an insanely contrived film.We all know what the story is about and the premise is rather primal, I must admit, encouraging me to see the film. But it was poorly written. POORLY. It started with the characters then snowballed down the hill to a contrivance cesspool where it drowned.I didn't like any of the characters, except for Alex, played by Paul Dano. The second character I empathized with was Detective Loki (Gyllenhaal), who almost went on my list of \"Idiots the world would be better off without,\" but he avoided it by really trying to find the girls and practically being tormented by Dover (Jackman), father of one of the girls abducted.Now Dover was one of the worst characters in the film, probably in movie history. He was written for us to connect to, whether we disagreed with his methods or not. But in the end, he was basically jeopardizing the investigation. His level of stupidity was dangerous, to himself and everyone around him. So, he may not be a thinking man. I could buy that. Then could he at least smarten up somewhere towards the end of the film? Where was his character arc, his moment of truth? Are we to assume he actually learned something as events unfolded? Never once did he admit his humility and humanity, and yield his control of events over to fate. It could've taken 5 seconds. But he didn't. I'm not going to give away too much, but he was angry and desperate until the end.Then you had Dover's band of douchebags, like the Birch's, who also lost their daughter and are seemingly close friends with the Dovers. They most likely shared stupid pills as well. There wasn't a single useful person in the film. Loki came close but he did things I couldn't imagine anyone with his expertise, who supposedly solved every crime or missing person case he ever worked (not clear as to the kind of detective he was), doing the things he did. Also, he rarely called for backup or assistance, and don't give me that malarkey about the town's underfunded police department. Did everyone have to be brain-dead and desperate like Dover? To answer the previous question, yes, they had to be this way otherwise things would have had to happen differently, and it could've ended badly like how things happen in real life sometimes. But, as a writer, when you intend on something happening one way to get the result you want, most likely a happy ending, then you have to have characters who can comply, even at their own detriment, and that's where contrivances find their home and breed.The film had way too many wasted moments. Most of it did nothing to move the story along. Some lines, like the \"solved every case\" line regarding Loki's illustrious career as a police officer, not only made me chuckle but they felt more like set pieces, like the blue lamp on Dover's end table. Other wasted elements in the film were like red herrings that only added the extra 30 minutes to the already long movie.Also, the antagonist's agenda was quite ridiculous, as most have been in recent Hollywood movies. They're now very roundabout and overly complicated, making them ridiculous, instead of more direct approaches. The bad guys are working way too hard to reach their ultimate goal. I thought the hard work was supposed to be reserved for the good guys. \"Rage against God\"? Really? That makes as much sense as going through the trouble to control the money and assets of all the local billionaires, taking power away from the wealthy and giving it to the the persecuted, all to create anarchy just before blowing up the city, and making the town's wounded hero watch it all from some prison pit in nowhere land.

            "content": "Needless to say that this film had a lot going for it before it reached cinemas, from the stellar cast to the intriguing choice for director. This film is shocking,emotional, heart pounding and gripping it is certainly a roller-coaster of emotions watching this modern day marvel.Director Denis Villeneuve is one of the upcoming great directors of his generation and this film only bolsters this claim. This absolutely blew me away and still does after multiple viewings, the story to this film is so interesting and more importantly complex and difficult. Which makes for a great watch knowing that you have no idea what could happen next, and even when you do start to wonder what could happen the film goes in a completely different direction. It is so refreshing to see that a film was given the directing treatment that this film had, truly gripping from start to finish with perfect camera work and positioning throughout the film. Villeneuve as a director will definitely go on your radar after this film. As briefly mentioned the story of this film is a breath of fresh and incorporates many different aspects of film. Whether it be more tender moments of emotion early on in the film before the daughters go missing, or to almost un-watchable torture of Paul Dano's character is truly breath taking. This film has drama elements with the family trauma that both families are having to deal with. The big obvious element of film this has is thriller and is used in fantastic ways. From Jake Gyllenhaal's character creeping around a dark basement to watching the kidnapper...*wink wink*..... creep around peoples house, nail biting stuff. However I feel this film taps into a more darker element that isn't shown in film a lot and that is psychological. This film messes with your mind and that is fantastic to see that a film can have such an impact on an audience. The mental state that specific characters are in really challenge your feelings towards them in a split second specifically Hugh Jackman's character who you feel a great empathy towards for the obvious reason. However some of the characters decisions in the film doubt your warm or emotional feelings towards him, extremely clever by the story. The performances in this film are at the top, every single person has a flawless performance however there are a few that standout among the rest. Firstly Hugh Jackman who is just fantastic in this role of a grieving father desperate to find his missing daughter. His character is all over the place and gave Jackman an array of options and possibilities. As already mentioned you do feel for the guy and the extreme worry that he carries through the film that his daughter could be dead. Even when he makes dreadful decisions you end up still wanting him to succeed. Next Jake Gyllenhaal who is also brilliant as a cop trying to do his job at the best of his ability to bring home the two missing girls. As we are following him around as he investigates people for information you really want him to succeed especially due to the circumstances of the case he is up against. Then finally you see him unravel the mystery and the twist and turns and who could be the person who took the girls. When I finally realised just when Gyllenhaal's character did sort of, it was a special moment and truly satisfying. The rest of the cast are all still so good they deserve a mention for there work Paul Dano, Terrence Howard, Viola Davis, Maria Bello and Melissa Leo. Finally the ending of the film definitely reminds me of Inception, the fact that we will never no what happens after Jake Gyllenhaal turns his head back towards the sound you think he might of heard, because to me it isn't clear if the sound he is hearing is the wind, extremely clever and oddly satisfying by Denis Villeneuve. The film will blow you away and defiantly needs your attention and time because it is a true modern day marvel of a thriller. 90 % out of 100 but possibly heading towards 95% this film has always blown me away every time I have viewed it, insanely good film.",

            "content": "Aaron Guzikowski's screenplay for 'Prisoners' was near the top of the list of best unmade for quite some time; at one point Hugh Jackman was attached to the project, but dropped out for reasons that remain unclear, though scheduling conflict may not be quite as pertinent as a lack of artistic cohesion with the original director. As serendipity would have it, the much later arrival of Denis Villeneuve as director, to his first English language feature, drew a mega cast of great talent, both in front of and behind the camera, including Jackman again. This is presumably based on the acknowledgement of his previous Award-nominated work. With Villeneuve on board, the screenplay seemed destined to become so much more than your average abduction thriller; to a great extent this fact is both the strength, and arguably the weakness of the final product.The straightforward setup is of two quite different but friendly families whose daughters go missing after Thanksgiving dinner. When the detective assigned to the case apprehends a suspect and finds no evidence of any crime with which to charge him, he has no choice but to release him. The subsequent act of the film follows the predictable route of a father taking the law into his own hands, and raises important questions about the morality and effectiveness of torture, the dangers of all actions and judgements, right or wrong, being governed by instinct and not logic, and the most obvious: What would you do, and where would YOU draw the line? The final act reaches a little too hard for a \"Gotcha!\" finale, which may disappoint those who did not want to see it become a more generic thriller, but it does not undermine the movie too badly. 'Prisoners' is beautifully shot by the man responsible for some of the best looking films you can name, Roger Deakins. Much as with the late Conrad L. Hall, you can sense that every shot took forever to setup, but the result always justifies that time. With a constantly gritty, doom-laden tone, one really cannot help but keep thinking of David Fincher; with the inclusion of Jake Gyllenhaal as Detective Loki, it is near impossible not to recall 'Zodiac'. There has been much made of Hugh Jackman's powerhouse performance as the angry Keller Dover, and there is no doubt his intensity is spot-on, but for me, Gyllenhaal actually quietly steals the show with a perfectly-pitched performance as a dog-tired, stressed detective who can feel his grip on the case gradually slipping; I don't think he has been better.The film is paced with a deliberately painful slowness; its moments of tension and excitement are highlighted as quite so intense by virtue of their brevity. This is a story of depth, with a lot to digest and discuss on every level. The thoughtful watcher will, upon reflection, come to realise nothing in the film is irrelevant; as Detective Loki himself says, \"Everything matters.\" The twists and turns in the final act build on the idea at the heart of the film, with the title growing increasingly relevant; this encourages deeper thought than your more average thriller. Something rather fascinating about the direction is that from quite early, a lot of the audience will already know HOW the film will end; it is HOW it gets there which might take most by surprise!'Prisoners' isn't a movie you enjoy so much as admire; incredibly artful, it is more a film of ideas and thinking points. It may be possible to pick little holes in the procedural elements, but it remains a challenging piece that will probably benefit from repeat viewing. Due to the fact everything ties up well, it is not as hole-riddled as a casual viewer may think, although that is not to say that, as it heads into more generic \"Fincher\" territory, it does not become a little too convoluted for its own good; certainly there is little doubt the film is at its strongest as the tense, slow examination of a controversial topic. Despite the contrivances, the fact that it is, at times, more heavy-handed than it need be, and that Terrence Howard, Viola Davis and Melissa Leo are given frustratingly little to do, 'Prisoners' nevertheless remains a piece of work which demands attention and respect for the film making.It would certainly be unjust to say this isn't one of the films of the year, and I definitely sense an Oscar for the cinematography here.",

            "content": "Canadian director Denis Villeneuve is back with another densely plotted movie with 'Prisoners'. His 2011 'Incendies' was interesting but ultimately full of too many scenes which forced the viewer to suspend one's disbelief, one too many times. 'Prisoners' also has some questionable plot points but it's eminently more entertaining than Incendies.Villeneuve proffers up an interesting protagonist, Keller Dover (played by an intense Hugh Jackman), a survivalist type, who has no compunctions about teaching his son how to shoot a deer, on a hunting trip, depicted at the beginning of the film. While Jackman has a lot to work with depicting the hot-head Keller, Terrence Howard has little to do playing Franklin Birch, Keller's exact opposite: a passive (and thinly drawn) middle class black professional. The break into Act II occurs when Keller's and Birch's daughters are abducted after disappearing from the Birch family home. Since an RV was parked right near where the girls disappeared, the driver ends up as the number one suspect. The police soon track the driver down at a rest stop and he tries to escape by eluding a police blockade with his RV. The driver turns out to be Alex Jones, who on the surface appears to be mentally feeble. When Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) can find no evidence linking Alex to the girls' abduction and concludes he doesn't have the mental capacity to kidnap the girls, he's forced to release him, and allow him to return to the residence of Holly Jones, his aunt, a creepy senior, expertly played by Melissa Leo.A good deal of 'Prisoners' revolves around Keller's abduction and subsequent imprisonment of Alex, who he believes knows where the kidnapped girls are. Keller insists that Alex told him \"they didn't cry until I left them,\" when Keller tries to choke him at the time he's released by the police, in front of a multitude of TV news reporters (no one else hears what Alex says to Keller). Before discussing the issue of Alex's refusal to talk, there are two red herrings in the plot, designed to throw you off track. Both involve Detective Loki's interaction with two suspects. The first is a priest who's on parole for a sex crime\u2014out of the blue Loki finds a bound, deceased man in the priest's basement. The priest claims that he was forced to kill the man after he revealed (during confession) that he was a serial killer, who would kill again. Later, Loki chases after a suspicious man seen at a vigil for the missing girls, in front of the Birch's home. He turns out to be a wannabe serial killer, Taylor, who breaks into the family houses of real serial killer's victims and steals their clothes. Loki, who supposedly has solved all of his cases, blows this one, after Taylor grabs one of Loki's deputy's guns and shoots himself in the mouth.Even if you believe in both these incredible turn of events, one is hard pressed to believe in the film's main premise\u2014that Alex would refuse to talk, despite being tortured for days by Keller. SUPER SPOILERS AHEAD. One of the arguments that Alex doesn't talk is because he is mentally handicapped. But that's debunked by the points Keller raises\u2014he knew about the girls and told Keller; he tried to escape from the police in his RV and had a driver's license and was able to drive.Another reason (which seems to be suggested by the filmmakers) is that he's under the spell of Aunt Holly and is either a) afraid of her, b) evil like her, or c) both. He seemingly is given a free pass at film's end, despite Keller's statement that he confessed that he basically knew where the girls were (the free pass may be due to the fact that Keller's credibility was completely suspect, by breaking the law by abducting him). Still, while possible, I still think it's unlikely that Alex would never have turned against the old lady. Think of the child abduction case of Steven Stayner. He was imprisoned for seven years but when given the opportunity, he escaped and saved a newly abducted child. Alex was the first child abducted by Holly and her husband and the filmmakers would like us to believe he was psychologically beholden to his captor. But in real life, the Stayner case proves the opposite. I would like to think the desire for freedom would still burn in Alex's breast and his abduction by Keller would have been the perfect opportunity for him to spill the beans about his aunt. By confessing, he's smart enough to know that Aunt Holly would immediately be taken into custody and he would not have to be afraid of her anymore.Prisoners represents a critique of those who embrace the survivalist mentality and act as vigilantes. We expect Keller to save his daughter but actually Detective Loki does so after racing to the hospital and saving Keller's daughter from poisoning (Loki's big car race is not that exciting, since the outcome is pretty much expected). Instead, Keller underestimates Holly who turns out to be responsible for the girls' abduction as well as numerous other serial killings. Keller ends up in that hole and my interpretation of the abrupt (but clever) ending, is that he WILL rescue Keller, and let him face the music.'Prisoners' indeed will drag you into its electrically-charged story and keep you at the edge of your seat to the end. The supporting players, those who play the wives and children of Keller and Franklin, do quite well, but are saddled by underdeveloped parts. Ultimately, you will have to overlook the red herrings and the main premise that the feeble (or perhaps not so feeble) Alex, will not crack under torture. I prefer to believe that he would, as most people would in that situation.",

            "content": "Filled with a barrage of visual symbolism and plenty of poetic justice (especially during the final shot) \"Prisoners\" would have undoubtedly made a better novel than movie. That said, it wasn't the surprisingly superb and layered Aaron Guzikowski (Contraband) script that I had a problem with (well, there was one scene concerning a certain character walking his dog that was a little too absurd, but\u0085) it's the surprisingly average direction from Denis Villeneuve (Incendies) which had me proclaiming: \"If only this had been directed by the Cohen Brothers!\" Synopsis: On an aggressively rainy night, six-year-old Anna Dover and her friend Joy go missing; presumably abducted. After this initial event, \"Prisoners\" forks off into two separate yet competing (and many times, interacting) story lines. In one, Jackman's character, Keller Dover (father of Anna) seeks vengeance on who he suspects to be the abductor, a mentally challenged man named Alex, who looks like the portrait of a child molester, and played by Paul Dano, in a role which seemed to be tailor-made for him (I don't know if that's a good or bad thing). The second storyline sees the tattooed Detective Loki (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) as the lead investigator on the case, attempting to find the missing girls before it's too late.The Acting: While I was more than a little disappointed that Dano's character was all but completely forgotten about during the second half of this movie, the star studded cast, which consists of Viola Davis, Maria Bello, Terrence Howard, Melissa Leo, the aforementioned Jackman (who is just \"all right\" here. I mean, he has one scene where he goes all Wolverine on someone, but\u0085) and Dano all come through with decent to noteworthy performances. But the real star of the show is Gyllenhaal, who unquestionably has played some troubled and complex characters in his career and Detective Loki may be the most intriguing of them all. And it doesn't hurt that he gives an Oscar nomination worthy performance (oddly the only one in this movie).Final Thought: For 3/4th of this film, \"Prisoners\" is nothing less than a \"worth the price of admission\" thriller, entirely motivated by characters who are all interacting along the blurred lines of good and evil, in a story which basically depicts the age old outline of the Devil and God waging war over the souls of the innocent; in the same vein as 1995's \"Se7en\". However, the final 40 minutes is where \"Prisoners\" did lose me a little, as it meanders, taking twists and semi-confusing turns that may cause some viewers to check their watches rather than stay glued to their seats. That doesn't mean \"Prisoners\" isn't one worth checking out (just don't see it at AMC Mercado) as it is a film which will stay with you for hours after you've left the theater (in a good way) as it continuously begs the question: what lengths would you go to see that your child is safe?

            "content": "Something I need to get out of the way first - there are certain people who should stay away from this movie, if they don't want their evening ruined. It also demands a certain mood. Because sometimes, you don't want to think and analyze, sometimes you just want popcorn and a feel-good, black and white whodunit. I know the feeling. And it's impossible to tell on the description which way this one it will play out. It's not that it's a pretentious, wordy, artsy-fartsy snooze fest - but it is heavy, it is dark, and it is a thriller/drama. Be warned. If you liked the first episodes of True Detective, you can go right ahead. I could start by summarizing all the action that takes place and who the characters are, but this movie is at its heart only about crime-solving and kidnappings on the surface. Behind all of this, it is about evil, and what happens to people's psyche when they become victimized by it. How everyone needs a scapegoat, and how people will judge/punish other people for various forms of perceived evil - swiftly, emotionally, without thinking things through - simply because they have an instinctive need for doing so. And how this traps them in a vicious cycle,(a \"maze\") of evil, that none of them can find their way out of. I loved the themes of this movie. There's a lot of Alice in Wonderland-references,(LSD, mazes, rabbits) and the atmosphere is at once heavily realistic, and very surreal. There's a lot of prayers and preaches throughout the movie, especially about how we are all born sinners, which becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy for the characters hit by sorrow and despair. But Christianity is not at all the point; in the very beginning, a criminal detective is shown judging other people by the year they are born, simply because he believes in astrology. It follows the same message without tying itself to one religion. The only innocents are the children,(whom also come in the shape of severely damaged \"adults\") who understands the metaphorical \"maze\" - which, to many reviewer's annoyance, is not completely literal - and finds their way out of it, time and time again. The children tries to communicate what they know with the adults several times, but these so-called crime-solvers are too busy finding sinners to actually listen. I loved the performances,(save for Hugh Jackman, who did not seem to connect with his grieving father-role very well) I loved the music, and I loved how this movie was about the \"victims\" for once, not the often boring perpetrators. It's atmosphere and mysterious tone was something out of the first episodes of True Detective, and it stayed consistent the entire way. But because it was so concerned about message, symbolism and character, it sometimes lost the realism in the form of a few plot-holes, and was not always completely realistic regarding the actions of several characters. For example(early spoiler) some detective finds the door to a hidden cellar behind a fridge by obscure coincidence, and it strains the suspension of disbelief. I can forgive most of the other stuff, though, and I'm not quite convinced some parts are as illogical as other people have stated; to me, it was believable for certain characters to become trapped in their own bad decisions, and to lose their way in a misguided attempt to do right.",

Now, I won't give away spoilers because I don't want to ruin this movie for anybody but let me tell you this, it is incredibly wrong and at times a little slow but it holds true to the realism of these kind of events. You bite your nails wondering where the children are and you begin to doubt if Hugh Jackman is doing the right thing by abducting (and torturing) a boy who he thinks took the girls. Each parent is shown as they spiral downward from fear, anger and loss. Jake Gyllenhaal gives his best performance as Detective Loki, his bad ass attitude slowly chipping away into desperation. The movie may not be the best out there but emotionally, it makes you question how far you would go to find the person you love and just how hard will you cling to the belief that you are right.",

It points you subtly in the right direction and lets you figure out the rest on your own. I will credit the director for this.The characters are so well written and well acted, each of them are three dimensional, and they will keep you guessing throughout the entire film as to who the bad guys and the good guys are.All I can say to you the potential viewer is get this movie, get a big thing of popcorn and extra large drink because you are NOT going to want miss a minute of this movie, in fact you really don't want to pause it either.",

This is a very good action/thriller/drama kind of film that really manages to capture you from the very beginning and keeps you at the edge of your seat throughout.

It's been slim pickings for adult audiences who may not be in the mood to attempt an awards contender, but want to be treated like they have some brain activity. Thrillers are a great use of adult films, actors and audience. Adults want to feel the \"edge\" of suspense stories, like teenagers do with horror films; but while not wasting their time with a low quality film. Prisoners brings back that genre that has felt extinct since 2005, a colossal year for thrillers. The acting is fantastic. Prisoners hired actors who know how to act and wanted to make the picture for the sake of trying their best. Hugh Jackman punches us with his vehemence, a performance that shakes you, even if his accent may not be etched out with perfection. Jake Gyllenhaal has a more unnoticed character that slowly builds to moments allowing Gyllehaal to execute strength and power.Viola Davis brings the house down with only one meaty scene. Terrance Howard reiterates he's a talent that can convey massive emotion by saying very little. Melissa Leo turns in her best post-Oscar portrayal, but still doesn't \"wow\" us like she used to. Sadly, Maria Bello didn't cut it for me. Her crying scenes seem phony and I don't empathize with her character. The character is written to be a mother barely grasping onto hope in her life; it feels like Bello didn't put the effort in to make that character reach her full potential. After seeing as many films as I have, especially films intended to spook you, sooner or later you learn all the tricks and your threshold adapts to the environment you've grown a part of. Prisoners is the one film in a good while to actually scare me. Some images are terrifying and built with perfect sinister tone, while other scenes match those with jolting chases or disturbing moments of torture. The themes aren't anything groundbreaking, we've felt the messages of Prisoners in dozens of other films in the past. There's parallelism drawn with the conclusion, grief and religion are inevitable in a film of this topic, but those dramatics are not what interested me. The plain message that comes with the drastic twist just pleads to parents and babysitters to never underestimate anyone. Predators are lurking to swoop anything they can get their hands on at the right time. Child kidnapping is still a sensitive topic to be used in films right now and I found the plot pushing the envelope to be exhilarating.I believe in years to come Prisoners will gain a reputation similar to Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino's '90s hit, Heat: universally praised, cult-bound, and unnoticed with accolades. Both genre films give the audience credit to maintain a well-paced narrative. Prisoners doesn't feed us unnecessary information, it often cuts a scene off when the built action reaches the goal of the scene without letting us see the predictable result. Prisoners puts its genre on the path for the future.Grade: A-Rating: 8/10",

            "content": "Prisoners (2013) - [10/10]What a beautiful film. Prisoners (2013) is one of the greatest thriller/mystery films ever made - at least that I've seen - and it is great for many reasons. One of the reasons is the writing. Every story piece is so intricate, so complex - exactly like a maze. Aaron Guzikowski did such an amazing job, taking a familiar concept (child abduction) and taking all the stigmas, stereotypes, etc. surrounding this topic and flipping them on their heads. He wrote with such realism, crafting such tense, empathetic, and surreal moments. I found myself sympathizing with each character; caring about each and everyone of them deeply. I cried with the characters. I felt their anger. I felt everything. The audience was a part of the story. Every random piece of \"arbitrary\" story truly wasn't random. Simplistic resolutions and small little details mattered in this film. As the film progressed, I thought I had the story figured out - I thought I did - but I was so wrong. With each scene and sequence there were so many twists and surprises; each a turn inside of the maze that is Prisoners (2013). Denis Villeneuve is going to go down as one of the greats. His direction allowed this complex story to be told in a very unique way. I haven't seen much of his work, aside form Arrival (2016), but because of this film I have deep respect for him. Each scene was extremely tense, and it started from the very beginning of the film. Immediately you knew something was wrong even though nothing was explicitly stated. There's so many techniques to learn from Villeneuve's knowledge on building tension, mood, tone, and atmosphere. It felt like I was holding my breath from the opening words that appeared on screen, Prisoners, and wasn't allowed a second to breathe until the abrupt cut to black and the closing credits. (The ending is perfect by. It is probably one of my favorite endings ever.) There is so much symbolism in this film. From snakes, to mazes, to being a prisoner. A prisoner of someone else's, a prisoner in jail, or becoming a prisoner of one's own creation. I cannot wait to analyze more of this film and truly understand Prisoners (2013). Now onto the performances. What can I say about these actors. Jake Gyllenhaal, Hugh Jackman, Paul Dano, Viola Davis, Melissa Leo, Maria Bello, Terrance Howard - everyone was so real. Gyllenhaal and Jackman give their best performances I have ever seen. They became their characters. You could sympathize with Jackman's character, Keller Dover, and understand everything he was going through and at the same time you as if became Gyllenhaal's partner - the audience was the lone-wolf Detective Loki's partner throughout the inverstigation. Gyllenhaal is a spectacular actor and this is my favorite performance by him. Each small detail about his character, from his tattoos, to his mason ring, or to the simple looks he gives - is perfect from the moment he is introduced in the story. The chemistry that is created when Gyllenhaal and Jackman are together is unnerving. Jackman's rage and emotion contrast Gyllenhaal's independence and seriousness. Jackman gave the best performance I have seen from him as well. All of these characters are people that could really exist. They're extremely realistic and it works. Another standout is Paul Dano and David Dastmalchian. I can't say much about their characters because it would spoil some of the film, but they are haunting. Paul Dano is a really underrated actor and he shines in this. You can see everything about his character just from his eyes. His eyes tell you so much about himself and the story. I cannot stress this enough - his eyes. To be able to do that takes so much skill and dedication. Paul Dano really commits in this film and is the perfect person to be in between Gyllenhaal and Jackman. Dastmalchian utilizes similar skills that Dano uses. I really can't speak about his performance too much, but it is equal to the caliber of the other actors. One last actor I'll talk about is Melissa Leo. She frightened me so much in this film. I'd compare her performance to Anthony Perkins in Psycho (1960). Once again, I really can't say much about her either, but her eeriness is enough to make you want to look away from the screen. The casting in this film was perfect. Not a single actor doesn't put in their all for the film. Jackman and Gyllenhaal really operated at another level. To truly understand what I'm talking about you need to see Prisoners (2013). Roger A. Deakins. What a legend. Every film he captures is beautiful and Prisoners (2013) is no different. Every scene was art. Every scene had some sort of symbolic subtext. He is able to capture emotion in the small things. From pill bottles, to trees, to candles. So beautiful. A lot of the sequences happen in really dark colored settings and to be able to capture beauty in that is crazy. In one scene in particular, we see rain turn to snow and the way he chose to film it is beautiful. I can't figure out another way to describe it other than beautiful. I think this may be my favorite film he's been Director of Photography on. How he didn't win best cinematography at the 84th Academy Awards amazes me. (I really have a lot more to say about this film - but I'll shorten it down.) The editing was to the point and really satisfying. The sound design was layered and actually very quiet. This film is a slow burn and utilizes silence differently than most films, so when loud moments happen they are meaningful. The score by J\u00f3han J\u00f3hannsson captures what Prisoners (2013) is. I really love it, so I was very sad to find out he passed away in 2018. I think he could have became one of the greatest composers in film history, much of that greatness seen with his work on this film. Each chord oozes emotion onscreen. The lighting is beautiful. For the most part they relied on natural light - which I prefer in film, and it works. A lot of the scenes are in darkness so when we see light, it adds a lot of meaning and value to the film - it has a purpose. Prisoners (2013) was snubbed on so many levels. I believe it is a masterpiece, but it hasn't been recognized as such. It is criminally underrated. The writing is so effective. The characters are so complex yet so relatable. The symbolism throughout is breathtaking. The direction is masterful. The performances, equally masterful. Most importantly of all, to understand Prisoners (2013) completely it would require a second or third watch. In my opinion that is a sign of the greatness in a film. To watch it multiple times and still take away new ideas from it means the film is a masterpiece. It is a masterclass in suspense, atmosphere, cinematography, acting, symbolism, editing, everything. It is heartbreaking, horrific, and familiar - I loved it. Once you start watching this film, Villeneuve and Guzikowski will trap you in the maze that is Prisoners (2013) until the very end of the film when it all makes sense, and you know which path is the correct way to the exit.",

Jake Gyllenhaal is great as the persistent cop who swears to solve the case even if that means risking his own life. The chemistry between the angry and suspicious father and the police officer who asks him not to meddle with the case is the driving force moving the plot forward because ''Prisoners'' is more of a character-driven drama than an action thriller, which places the emphasis on the emotions of the devastated parents and the obsessiveness of the detective. The rest of the cast acts pretty decent and overall ''Prisoners'' should be on the top-10 of crime films for the last five years. Highly recommended!",

This film also superbly takes it's time to delve deep into it's story, and characters.After just recently watching Se7en I think this film is a much stronger thriller. As this film did what I criticized Se7en for not doing, which is doing more with the detective aspect of the story. I always looked forward to getting back with Detective Loki, played tremendously by Jake Gyllenhaal. His scenes were the moments I enjoyed the most.With phenomenal acting, score, and atmosphere that left you feeling every moment the characters were makes Prisoners a film for the ages.10/10Watched on Hulu.",

            "content": "Prisoners is the type of movie that is getting less and less recurrent in Hollywood and a must-see for anybody that enjoys a thriller that doesn't reach exaggerated proportions. Morally challenging and provoking, this is a story about how to handle a dire situation such as the disappearance of two young children. The two main characters provide us with very different scopes of this dilemma. On one hand Jackman's Dover is an emotional driven man who while acknowledging his wrong doings, doesn't restrain himself and goes past any boundaries to ensure his family's safety. On the other hand Gyllenhaal's Loki is a detective that not only shows determination to succeed in another case, but grows to be defined by it, as even he will boil under pressure. The performances are astonishing from these two men and you feel their tribulations throughout the film, whether it's Jackman's descent into near madness or Gyllenhaal's anxiety as he pursues every lead possible. Director Denie Villenueve provides us with a moody setting that not only attracts us to this shadowy story, but also connects with all aspects provided with his co-workers such as a fantastic cinematography work and a striking script that will fill with as much doubt as the characters in the movie. My only complaint is that I thought it ran a bit too long and a little sharper editing would have been fine with me, since not only would I rate it higher, but also would have had an even better experience. Having watched the film, I can only say that is deserving of its recognition (IMDB Top 250) and I hope I get to see more movies churned out like these.Rating 7/10",

            "review_title": "The best acting performances of the year",
            "content": "I have seen many good movies from all around the world this year but \"Prisoners\" seems to be the best North American film of the year so far. It's not so much about the story of the movie that recalls the French Canadian \"7 Days\" movie by Daniel Grou that was inspired by a Patrick Sen\u00e9cal novel. Both films tell the story of a desperate family father who seeks revenge on a strange suspect for kidnapping (or worse?) his daughter while everything around him is suddenly falling apart.The impressive things about \"Prisoners\" are others. One must mention the constant dark atmosphere of the movie. This is due to the intensive story that is in fact the worst nightmare for any loving father or mother on earth. This movie is an intense mixture of the drama and thriller genres with a few decently used gore scenes and scary moments that aren't a far call from the horror genre. Each character shown in this movie is going through really hard times from the family father, his wife, his son and his best friends over the more and more isolated detective to the suspected kidnapper and a strange copycat kidnapper. In addition to this, most of the time in this movie the sky looks very grey, it's raining or actions take place in the middle of almost moonless nights. The inoffensive but dark and somewhat uneasy score underlines this depressive film noir approach.Not only the French Canadian director Denis Villeneuve who created the intense drama \"Incendies\" in the past delivers a detailed and intense work. The most outstanding thing is the acting. Hugh Jackman plays the role of his life as a desperate family father who is slowly going insane and ready to do anything to save his daughter. It's hard to portray a character who is going through such an incredible nightmare but Hugh Jackman is always convincing. You can feel his emotions in every word he speaks, in every move he makes and in every breath he takes. This acting performance should be worthy of an Academy Award. Jake Gyllenhaal is just as great and also does his best acting performance. He portrays a visibly nervous detective if you just take a look on his almost hyperactive eye movements. We see a detective who tries to be professional and dedicated to his job but who gets more and more isolated and who starts making more and more mistakes. By the end of the movie, the kidnapping case has also become something almost personal for him as he acts beyond rationality to solve the case. Jake Gyllenhaal's performance is also worthy of an Academy Award. The supporting actors are also doing a fine job. Especially Paul Dano convinces as inscrutable and unpredictable suspect. His aunt portrayed by Melissa Leo gets better and better as the movie progresses.The tension of the story gets more and more elevated towards the end. I don't want to reveal any twists but let's say that I didn't see the incredible revelations coming. During the last thirty minutes or so, the movie even got me more on the edge of my seat than it was the case before. These last thirty minutes introduce a whole new dimension to the movie. Some viewers may dislike this new approach but I thought that it added even more intensity to the film.At the end of the day, this is an atmospheric, intense and extremely well acted film noir that mixes credible drama elements with gripping and sometimes scary crime passages. If you care for any of these genres, you can't get around this movie this year. I hope it will win a couple of Academy Awards next year as I can hardly see any better Hollywood movie these days. I'm convinced this will be considered as a classic or one of the best movies of all times one day.",

Prisoners is one of the those movies that you're glad you came across(S/O my brother Prince Sickness for the put on you gave me), the combination of raw emotion and extreme acting depth in both the leads and the supporting cast adds to the overall experience. This movie doesn't only express the extreme lengths people go to satisfy both needs and wants but the importance of sustaining moral apathy. Jake Gyllenhaul's acting was phenomenal as always, but it was Hugh Jackman's performance that gave me absolute chills in every sceneThis is as gripping as gripping can be...

It's billed as a crime movie, but feels more like a horror movie!Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal put in superb performances as respectively one of the parents and the investigating officer of two children that have gone missing. It is clear that they don't trust each other even though they are on the same 'side' and it's the tension between these two characters that makes this movie spark.The horror comes from Hugh Jackman's character resorting to imprisoning and torturing a suspect who he is convinced took his child, subjecting him to probably even worse treatment than the missing children have experienced. The other parents find out what is going on, but choose to turn a blind eye. As I said, it's deeply unsettling.Towards the end the movie turns into a face-paced edge of the seat thriller, as the facts of the cases are revealed in quick succession and both Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal's characters race to find and rescue the children. The tension reaches fever pitch as the horrific truth of what has happened comes to light.",

            "content": "Now, I move on to PRISONERS, directed by Denis Villenueve from a script written by Aaron Guzikowski.I am going to try to keep this review a short one because I know this movie is very dark and serious and can get very disturbing and emotional in a few areas during the 153-minute feature running time. There will be a few spoilers in this review, so if you haven't seen the film, you may want to.PRISONERS just blew me away with it's story. Aaron Guzikowski wrote a screenplay that is just really amazing with great dialogue and a great plot in this film. The story focuses on the abduction of two young girls in Pennsylvania and the police's subsequent search. Keller Dover and his wife Grace attends a Thanksgiving dinner at the home of their neighbors Franklin and Nancy Birch and both families' younger daughters, Anna Dover and Joy Birch goes missing. Detective David Loki arrests and questions the driver of a suspicious vehicle, Alex Jones and Dover attacks Jones after he is released.Loki is doing different cases, but Dover decides to take matters into his own hands and tortures Alex Jones for answers, but he denies that he is Alex Jones and claims that he escaped from a maze. Dover visits Jones' aunt, Holly and she tells that she and her husband were religious until their son died of cancer. Joy Birch is found drugged but alive. Dover visits her in the hospital and Joy tells him \"You were there\".Loki searches for Dover and discovers Jones. Dover goes to the Jones' house to get information, but Holly pulls a gun out on him. She makes him put handcuffs on his hands and drinks some kind of poisoning, but I'll get to that in a minute. She explains that her and her late husband abducted many children as part of their \"war on God\" after their son died. She shoots him in the leg and forces him to get inside a concealed pit and imprisons him in the pit, where he finds a whistle belonging to his daughter.Anna is found with Holly, but Anna is taken to the hospital and Holly is killed. Outside the Jones' house, Loki hears Dover's labored whistling from the pit that he is imprisoned in.I thought the pacing and dialogue was a little confusing, but also really amazing throughout the movie and that is an incredible but hard and challenging thing to pull off, but a lot of movies has done this really great.***SPOILER ALERT!*** Like I said in the plot, Dover is imprisoned by Holly and this was the main issue I had with the film. Because for two reasons: \u0095 1. She imprisons him in a concealed pit, makes him drink some kind of poison. I don't know what it is, but it's all black. She makes him put handcuffs on his hands and shoots him in the leg, forcing him to get inside the pit. I think this could have been done better with music in the scene at least.\u0095 2. The ending was a little confusing and I only watched this movie once, but I think the end is there just to set up a sequel.The acting is just amazing. Hugh Jackman deserves a lot of credit for his performance as Keller Dover. Jake Gyllenhaal plays Detective Loki wonderfully. Terrence Howard, Viola Davis and Maria Bello are all great in this film. Paul Dano plays Alex Jones and he is great in the part that he had to play and he was an amazing casting choice for the film.The only performance that I had trouble with was Academy Award winner Melissa Leo's character, Holly Jones. She had to wear make-up for the part, but she is just scary as heck in the part that she plays and what she did to Hugh Jackman's character did not seemed like a very good idea at all.This is the reason why this film appeared on my Top 10 Overrated Movies list is because of the ending, which I just mentioned. This movie really deserved the Oscar for Best Cinematography and Best Picture, but the Academy only chooses great movies.PRISONERS is a great film, and I will forever be angry that this did not win an Academy Award, but Frozen wins two Oscars? That is just crazy! This film was originally rated NC-17 for \"substantial disturbing violent content and explicit images\", but was re-edited to secure the R rating for \"disturbing violent content include torture and language throughout\". I am so glad that this got the R rating because I would not have been able to watch this film if it was NC-17.The music is just amazing. The cinematography, editing, production and costume designs are just amazing.Overall, I love PRISONERS. Even though the ending got on my nerves a little bit, I still love what this movie does and what it shows. This is one crime - drama / mystery - suspense thriller that I don't think gets enough credit.My rating is going to be the rating of 10 out of 10. It's a perfect movie and you should see it. Sure, it is graphic, disturbing, emotional and violent in some areas, but if you can look past some of that, you may be able to find one great drama that will satisfy you.PRISONERS is a great film that will blow you away and the performances of Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Melissa Leo, Maria Bello, Viola Davis, Terrence Howard and Paul Dano in this film will certainly blow you away from beginning to end and you will not be able to take your eyes off your television screen from start to finish once this movie begins and once it ends after 2 hours.",

            "review_title": "A sombre and slow, but excellent piece of work",
            "content": "Some films create a brilliant sense of atmosphere. 'Prisoners' is one of those films. From the moment it opens, we are greeted with an ice cold atmosphere that continues until the end, reflecting the chilly weather that pervades through the suburban Pennsylvania setting. Roger Deakins' stunning cinematography really helps in crafting this atmosphere, as like the film, it moves at a slow and often languorous pace, occasionally honing in on things that don't necessarily move the plot forward, but add to the mood. Coupled with the superb score by J\u00f3hann J\u00f3hannsson, a feeling of dread is created from the beginning, lingering over ever frame right up until the credits roll.This dark and chilly atmosphere suits the plot of 'Prisoners' perfectly. During a Thanksgiving gathering involving two families, each one's youngest daughter mysteriously vanishes, nowhere to seen, leaving fathers Franklin Birch (Terrence Howard) and God-fearing, American survivalist Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) deeply concerned over the fate of their kids. Loner Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) takes on the case and soon arrests Alex Jones (Paul Dano), a guy \"with the IQ of 10 year- old\", but struggles to find any evidence against him. However, it's not long before a furious Keller takes matters into his own hands. Jackman has always been a good actor, despite sometimes being considered to be just a 'movie star', and with this film he gives what is very possibly his best performance to date. He's a magnetic force whenever on screen and is perfectly credible as a devastated father. Another person who is entirely credible in their role is Gyllenhaal. It may be as a result of starring in David Ayer's excellent 'End of Watch', but Gyllenhaal is terrific as Detective Loki, offering a great contrast to the fiery Jackman. He even goes so far as adding an actor's tick, as Loki frequently blinks, signalling his stress and anxiety. Jackman and Gyllenhaal are rounded off by a good supporting cast of Howard, Viola Davis, Maria Bello and Paul Dano at his creepiest.At 153 minutes, you could argue that 'Prisoners' is overlong, but its length was one of the best things about it for me, as I became absorbed in the drama. This is a slow film with slow passages; it definitely takes its time getting places, but with such a great sense of atmosphere, length is hardly an issue. This is more than simply a 'kidnap movie' as director Denis Villeneuve attempts to make a serious point about kidnapping, questioning the value of information obtained under duress and the idea of doing things with the right intentions even if it's against the law. Similarly, the characters exist in an area of gray morality, as evidenced by the fact that I sympathized with Keller and Alex. Sure, it's not perfect \u2013 the end twist feels somewhat generic, consequently jarring with the non-generic approach to the rest of the film. Nonetheless, this is a grimly-atmospheric, well-acted and excellently structured piece of work that has something intelligent to say to say about its subject matter.",

            "content": "Two average suburban American families, meet up to celebrate Thanksgiving together, everything is normal, safe and secure.Both families take great care to ensure their younger daughters are accompanied between households. Whilst out, they briefly climb and play on an RV that is parked in the street, they come back inside the house.Later they decide to out again, same ritual but this time they do not come back, the older children did not accompany them, everything is not normal, nothing will ever be safe and secure again.The parents of \"Anna\", god fearing and practical survivalist \"Keller Dover\" (Hugh Jackman) and his wife \"Grace\" (Maria Bello), look in all the usual places. The respective parents of \"Kyla\", \"Franklin\" (Terrence Howard) and \"Nancy\" (Viola Davis) also come up short, the young girls have disappeared, the police are called.Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) has seen it all before, he is sympathetic, diligent and above all, realistic. The Police get a lucky break, the RV is spotted locally and before long the driver is in custody.Alex Jones (Paul Dano) is everyone's idea of someone that could abduct young children, with Jeffrey Dahmer style glasses, strange ways, hushed voice and the mental age of a ten year old. Soon he is a prime suspect, but following questioning the police are obliged to let him go.The film centres around how far you would go, to find out what you need to know. If the information is important enough, what might you do to find your loved ones? To use the well known quote from Nietzsche, \"Whoever fights monsters should see to it that in the process, he does not become a monster\".When the children disappear, the initial casual concern escalates and is believably portrayed, making every parents nightmare real. The film asks some difficult questions, with no easy answers. Hugh Jackman plays a character we have not seen from him before. Whilst on occasion the acting is visible, perhaps due to how we normally perceive him. However, this is most definitely no Wolverine in civvies. All the central characters are good, notably Gyllenhaal and Jackman who are given the most to do.Davis and Bello as the grieving mothers are equally strong, as their known world starts to collapse around them. Both cope in different ways, driving a wedge into their relationships with their partners.However, Dano is the actor to watch. With so few words of dialogue, he still manages to convey a character who is at once, terrified, an object of pity, suspicion and yet still very obviously human.The film is filmed in a gritty down to earth, suburban grey and rain soaked style. Like the \"Killing\" TV series or \"Seven\", without the horror element. These are real people, in ordinary locations and everyday clothes. The abnormality of the crime screaming from behind white picket fences.There is much portentous music and on occasion we are being told what to feel but overall, this is classy, intelligent work. Guessing who did what, when and why is what these movies are all about and this does not disappoint.Some have drawn parallels with the War on Terror, this reviewer did not draw that conclusion, although it could be easily found. On this occasion, maybe a \"cigar is just a cigar\", what you see is what you get.By necessity the film is adult in content, however the violence is not gratuitous and whilst certain undercurrents exist, there is nothing obvious to make viewing uncomfortable. The ending deserves a mention, knowing when to fade to black is an art. Canadian director Denis Villeneuve in his largest project to date, has chosen well.Summary Anchored with strong performances, an excellent thriller with a solid human drama centre.A long film at 153 minutes but they disappear quickly, with the audience desperate to know what happens next.Recommended",

Holly's house was searched by the police (before it was known she was the kidnapper) but it was not noticed that the photo of her missing husband showed him wearing the same pendant recently discovered on a murdered child killer. They notice these things in most TV detective shows! 2. The rescued girls did not mention the pit, but they must have been conscious there at times (or surely would have died if dropped in that distance if unconscious) and would have recounted that horrific experience. Thus the police would have gone there to search for the pit, especially when Keller was missing. 3. It seems improbable that the first rescued girl would not have mentioned that they did go into the RV and, perhaps also, that a woman was involved at some point (I am sure she would not always have been disguised enough or said so little that it was not detectable); these clues would have sent the police to Holly's/Alex's house for a very detailed search. 4. Keller went to Holly's house fully suspecting she was the kidnapper; he had a gun but chose to keep his back to Holly for an overly long period (in fact, until she had the chance to produce her own gun!). A sensible person would have gone there with his gun out (he was already in plenty of trouble over the beating of Alex so this would have been a criminal risk he was willing to take). 5. Detective Loki drove at high speed with a bullet wound to the head to get Anna to hospital asap and narrowly missed several accidents (apart from the fact he may have fallen unconscious) and may have killed Anna and himself; he could have phoned the hospital and met an ambulance part way! 6. The derelict house owned by Keller would have been mentioned to the police at an earlier stage; anyway, the impression given was that the police accepted quite readily that Alex must have run away (and also later Keller), both cases in spite of this being a kidnapping case! Little serious effort went into finding these two missing persons.",

The film doesn't necessarily succeed at being epic, but it is terrifically well-paced for clocking-in at over a two-and-a-half hour runtime\u2014director Villeneuve does an excellent job using fade-outs to skip passed the obvious melodrama. The story involves emotions and chills from all aspects of an unthinkable crime, including: the family members of the abducted children, the investigators and even those close to the suspect. Unfortunately, the movie is dragged by too many obvious detective blunders by Gyllenhaal's characters: 1) Whaaa? I can't discreetly park my car in the middle of the road in broad daylight? 2) Whaaa? I'm going to have all family members take a polygraph, but not consider looking into the fact that one of the fathers owns an abandoned building the girls may be at? 3) Whaaa? When I finally find out one of the fathers owns an abandoned building and I establish my new suspicions of him, I SHOULD call a search team? 4) Whaaa? I've been seeing a lot of mazes ever since I started investigating these girls' disappearances. There IS a connection?Another unfortunate downfall is the annoying and awkward light adjustments between interior and exterior scenes.The moral of a film should either raise questions, or provide answers or some sort of hope. This film just kind of confuses, as it doesn't really grasp hold of how suspects are sometimes guilty until proved innocent or how there are some ridiculous limitations the law has at preventing and/or solving crimes. Either: A) make a statement, or B) give the audience something to reflect on. This film seems to do neither. It would be nice to go into a crime-thriller with an open-mind and NOT have to suspend as much disbelief. But all-in-all, not a complete waste of a film.**\u00bd (out of four)",

There is a good message to take away: when somebody is in danger the believe in God is important and to pray. What I didn't like therefore was the very long running time of two hours and a half! I mean, there are many puzzles but at the end it is a real torture to wait until the labyrinth is solved. So it is in my opinion sometimes too long paced and some scenes could have been cut. Please don't make such long movies. 6/10",

            "content": "I won't add much about the plot because that's already been done in spades. The title Prisoners is very apt for this movie, which focuses heavily on the effect that the disappearance of two young girls has on their families, the police detective who is investigating their disappearance, and a mentally retarded young man whose RV is connected with the crime and who may be, or may not be, the perpetrator.The girls disappear right under the noses of their parents and siblings. They all must cope with the abduction, but the father of one of the girls, Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman), has sworn to protect his family and reacts, often violently, to the intense stress put on him for his dereliction of duty. He kidnaps the mentally retarded young man, Alex Jones (Paul Dano), and tortures him in an abandoned apartment building, hoping to beat out of him the whereabouts of his daughter. His wife, Grace (Maria Bello) resorts to prescription drugs to deal with her loss. The other parents are bereft too. The other father (Terrence Howard) reluctantly ends up aiding Dover in the torture. Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) is able to relate the crime to some earlier abductions that had never been solved. He also must endure Dover's almost incessant raves that he (Loki) is mishandling the case. Eventually Dover's accusations get under his skin. Several clues are given who the real perpetrator is but they're easy to miss.The action takes place between Thanksgiving and Christmas in a small Pennsylvania town, so the weather is gloomy and overcast, often raining or snowing. Very appropriate for such a dark movie. A poignant scene is Keller Dover on his knees begging forgiveness from Jones, who's been sealed in a wooden closet for torture with only a small hole to look out of. If you grew up Catholic, it'll remind you of a penitent confessing to a priest in his darkened booth in the confessional. And Keller Dover, although driven by his demons, is a deeply religious man (he wears a cross on a chain around his neck) and is well aware he's committing mortal sin. But he'll do anything, including sacrificing his own life, to find his daughter.The ending is ambiguous in one sense. Although the perpetrator of the crimes receives justice, Keller Dover may, or may not, die in a very disquieting manner. Viewer's choice.The acting is first-rate, as well as the script and directing. If you can handle a very dark theme done in a very realistic way, then I'd highly recommend this movie.",

Lots of people are praising Jackman & Dano and yes they were amazing, but Gyllenhaal & Dastmalchian (who I didn't know was in this movie) deserve praise as well.I found out that Roger Deakins did the cinematography after watching the movie. And I would like to talk about the cinematograpy in one particular scene.. The scene where Dover dreams / sees the vision of his daughter. \"Prisoners\" is a very dark and depressing film, and the look of the film fits the vibe. (Grey / White colors) But during that one vision scene, it has this orange, warm vibe and it creates a great contrast with the rest of the movie. As a result it was one of the most memorable moments of the movie for me. :)LOVED the ending. It is a type of ending that won't leave my head anytime soon.",

            "content": "Some people are comparing PRISONERS, the new dramatic thriller starring Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal, to SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. I don't really see that, not only because the two movies are quite different, but because PRISONERS is a much better film than the generally overrated SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.PRISONERS is the story of a man obsessed with finding his missing daughter. Apparently kidnapped along with another young girl on a rainy Thanksgiving Day (and isn't Thanksgiving the most depressing of all holidays anyway?), little Ana seems to be gone without a trace. The only clue to her whereabouts is the description of a strange RV the girls were playing on shortly before their absence. But when the owner of the RV is found, there is no trace of the girls, no sign they were even in his vehicle. The police, represented by Detective Loki (Gyllenhaal), can't find any justification to charge the man, so they let him go. But Ana's distraught father, Keller (Jackman) knows better. And if the police won't do what's necessary to find his daughter, then Keller is more than willing to take matters into his own hands.PRISONERS is an absolutely stunning film. Visually, everything is starkly understated and dreary, much like the plot. The drama is heavy and morose, which is only appropriate given the subject matter. The script delves deep into the minds of people who have lost their children and are struggling with the unbearable burden of that loss, but it also shows us what the police who are charged with solving the most heinous of all crimes have to go through. Keller is the heart and soul of the film, and we feel his pain, rage, and frustration simmering throughout the whole movie. Keller is painstakingly detailed as a good man, a fine husband and father and devout Christian, and so the questionable moral choices he makes later take on the added weight of believable pathos.Detective Loki is likewise presented as a determined, essentially noble and sympathetic cop who is nearly as obsessed with finding Ana as her father is, though unlike Keller he understands procedure and desperately wants Keller to leave things alone so the police can do their job. Without question, each role shows Jackman and Gyllenhaal at their best, and both actors certainly deliver the finest performances of their excellent careers.PRISONERS is full of twists and turns and unexpected plot revolutions that at times threaten to devour one another in their labyrinthine dungeons, and so it is almost amazing that in the end everything comes together so logically and satisfactorily. Though a great thriller, PRISONERS is even more than that. It's a movie about the moral choices we make and the line between right and wrong, and where those choices may lead us. In short, PRISONERS is a new classic of suspense.",

            "content": "So how far would you go to get back your child who had just been kidnapped? That's the thrust of this dark movie which takes as its themes the disturbing and sadly, ever-topical subject of the abduction of young children and also the use of torture on the suspected perpetrator, even as I appreciate that the latter has only so far come into the public consciousness in the military world. Perhaps not being a parent and also something of a libertarian, I didn't find myself on the side of the, I hesitate to say, (avenging) angels and found the scenes of what I'll understatingly term rendition, as upsetting as they were unjustifiable in a so-called civilised society. Besides this I found the movie's condescension to the conventions demanded of Hollywood thrillers compromised the bigger subjects it attempted to address.The fulcrum of the film is the disappearance and as we soon learn, kidnapping of two young girls, one white, one black, from their two families on Thanksgiving Night in an anonymous blue-collar US town. After the prime suspect, a young, mentally retarded man, is released for lack of corroborative evidence, the two fathers, Hugh Jackman and Terrence Howard, decide to take matters into their own hands, the former leading the latter on and himself turning into a semi-crazed vigilante, abducting the suspect and creating a grisly torture chamber to extract the truth from him. Also becoming consumed with the case is the local one-man, or so it seems, police service, Jake Gyllenhaal, egged on by the impotence of the law he serves and a sympathy with the parents for their loss, he too struggles to preserve his sanity and necessary detachment from the case, but who of course still arrives at the Eureka-type resolution and ends up delivering, what I'll term a predictable Hollywood ending.Personally speaking, I couldn't marry up the wider philosophical and ideological questions the film throws up with the conventions of the dynamics of a big-money feature. I found it pandered too much to our baser emotions when in truth it should have been more questioning of Jackman's methods and I think sends out the wrong message about taking the law into one's own hands, no matter the provocation. On a more mundane level, I was unconvinced by the denouement, even to the extent of the surprise identity of the actual perpetrator and also the insertion of curious red-herrings along the way and an unbelievable life-or-death race-against-time.As for the acting, you'd certainly call it committed and driven, but for me anyway, both Jackman and Gyllenhaal failed to really engage me in their pivotal roles while the drawn- out direction, filmed to a backdrop of grainy, often rainy exteriors, never struck the required balance between docu-drama and nail-biting tension. This movie was a tough, gruelling watch (one suspects there is a much-longer director's cut in the background) and while a welcome reduction of the ridiculously over-the-top takes we've seen recently from Hollywood on this upsetting subject (Liam Neeson's \"Taken\" films for example), still didn't get the balance right, in my eyes.",

            "content": "Prisoners is the rare mainstream rated R mystery film that we hardly get from Hollywood anymore. It features an All-Star cast led by Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal. Prisoners is an intense thriller that keeps the viewer guessing and never feels contrived.Prisoners is directed by relative newcomer Denis Villeneuve who handles the star-studded cast and the heavy subject matter like a director who has a lengthy filmography of well-crafted films. The film is well paced and expertly structured. Although Prisoners is two and a half hours long, it never seems to lag. Villeneuve elevates the story and characters so it doesn't feel like an episode of one of the many \"whodunnit\" TV shows that pollute our airwaves.Hugh Jackman plays Keller Dover, a blue collar survivalist who has been preparing his entire life for the worst. When his daughter is kidnapped, it's something he could never have prepared for and he doesn't know how to deal with it. Feeling like he's let his family down and that the police aren't doing enough to find his daughter, Keller takes matters into his own hands and kidnaps the recently released suspect who he is certain knows more about what happened to his daughter and her friend who was also kidnapped. Jake Gyllenhaal plays Detective Loki, a passionate investigator who has solved every case he's ever worked on. Detective Loki's past is never explained, but he sports neck and hand tattoos hinting that he might have had a turbulent past. Loki also has a nervous twitch of the eyes that gets worse as the film progresses and the pressure begins to mount.It's understandable considering Detective Loki has to deal with an indifferent police captain, a grieving father who has gone rogue and a mysterious case that seems to get weirder with each clue.The rest of the cast is rounded out by Maria Bello, who plays Dover's wife. She's not given a whole lot to do here and spends much of the film in a state of sedation. Terrence Howard and Viola Davis play friends of the Dover's whose daughter was also kidnapped. They play the moral conscience to Keller as he starts going to extremes to get information about the whereabouts of the lost girls. Paul Dano, who is making a career of playing creepy crazy characters, plays Alex Jones, a mentally handicapped loner that is suspected of kidnapping the young girls. He plays the character with perfect balance. One second you want to bash his head in and the next you feel bad for him and can't help but feel he's being wrongly accused.Prisoners deals with the theme of religion very heavily. Characters are seen saying the Our Father and crucifixes can be seen dangling from rear view mirrors or hanging on walls. There are also themes of vengeance, resolution, justice.The other part of the film that stands out is the cinematography by legendary cinematographer Roger Deakins who has been nominated for 10 Oscars for films such as Skyfall, Shawshank Redemption, True Grit, Doubt, No Country for Old Men and A Beautiful Mind just to name a few. Deakins cloaks the film in a blanket of gloom. Every scene seems to be cloudy and rainy. Every frame is saturated with looming despair.After a summer of caped crusaders, furious cars, Brad Pitt hating zombies, giant robots and really lonely rangers, Prisoners is perfect for anybody looking for a serious film experience. Prisoners delivers an intense thriller that includes great performances from some of the better actors working today. Including a career best performance for Jackman with a possible Oscar nomination on the horizon. For me, Prisoners is up there with recent mystery films like Mystic River, Gone Baby Gone and Zodiac.",

Hugh Jackman and wife Maria Bello take their two kids over to their neighbors' (Terrence Howard and Viola Davis) house for Thanksgiving. Their two young daughters go outside to play and disappear. Detective Jake Gyllenhaal is assigned to the case and quickly finds the driver of a mysterious RV that had been seen in the neighborhood, a severely retarded man (Paul Dano). There's no evidence whatsoever that Dano did anything, but Jackman leaches onto him, refusing to believe the police in the matter. He soon kidnaps Dano and attempts to torture the truth out of him. The theme of compromised morality is powerful, and Jackman is great in this role. Gyllenhaal is also very good, although sometimes the character feels too much like a movie cop (this dude never calls for backup, even in the most dangerous situations!).

            "content": "Denis Villeneuve's Prisoners is way better than it looks in the trailer. The trailer seems to give away all the secrets of the film upfront; it portrays the film as lacking depth, but in reality, it's just the trailer that misleads. There is much more to Prisoners than one may anticipate.The film stars Hugh Jackman (surprise, surprise) as Keller Dover. Jackman is having an over- exposure problem at this moment in his career. As the actor seems to appear in every other film released these days, this creates questions that shouldn't exist like, \"What is the Wolverine doing in this movie Prisoners?\" Nonetheless Jackman delivers a solid, if not dimensional performance. His energy keeps the movie constantly driving forward.The film opens with two working class families getting together to celebrate Thanksgiving. Festivities abound, but while the responsible adults of the film have their attentions focused elsewhere, their two little girls run outside to play, unchaperoned. By the time the girls' absence is noticed, it's too late. The girls are gone. They have been taken. The major conflict of the film then is how to get the girls back alive.This job falls on Detective Loki, (Jake Gyllenhaal) but when Loki fails to produce results quickly enough, Keller Dover decides to take the search for the girls, and for civil justice, into his own hands. Performance-wise, Gyllenhaal as Loki is the highlight of the film. He maintains a subtle, calm composure, which contrasts Keller's (Jackman's) constant flying-off-the-rails. Loki shows a certain vulnerability while still being able to pull off fast-pace action sequences in an authentic, believable way. He is very enjoyable to watch.The actual visual experience of Villeneuve's films is very important. His 2010 film Incendies made full use of wide and vast cinematography applied in exotic landscapes. This visual imagery captivated, but all the technique was there to serve the story, the plot developments, the characters. Incendies is a masterfully crafted tragedy and Villeneuve's commanding technique is evident too throughout Prisoners.Like Incendies the filters and tones that are applied to the film, as in the actual visual images on screen, are gloomy and sepia-toned. There's not a single sunny sky, a warm day, an orderly room. Sets are designed to feel dark and empty, the best scenes use sets that play with space, showing both the abundance of vacant space for some characters, while still emphasizing the feeling of enclosure felt by others. The use of light and dark, order and disorder, space, all things that cradle the actors performances, are created by Villeneuve, expertly.The suspense of the film continues all the way to the very end as Keller Dover's untamed compulsion to find the missing girls leads to a perfectly executed, nail biter of an ending.More reviews at getthebonesaw.blogspot.com",

What is right? Who is wrong? And is it right to do wrong?On Thanksgiving the Dover family enjoy dinner at their old friend's house, the Birches. The enjoyment levels are at an all time high, for the only time in the film, until the youngest daughter from each family disappears. The parents begin to search frantically as the cops find the chief suspect in the RV that was parked up the road. This suspect has an IQ of a ten year old and the police believe they should look elsewhere but Keller Dover thinks otherwise and instead chooses his own methods of getting truth from the suspect. Will they find the girls and who will first?Starring Hugh Jackman as Keller Dover, Prisoners raises these intriguing issues by pitting the doting father against his daughter's potential kidnapper. As a parent you'd do anything to get those answers and in Dover's case this resorts to torture, imprisonment and fear. In opposition to that we have Jake Gyllenhaal's Detective Loki, an officer who relies on hard police work. These two may be aiming for a shared goal but ultimately they are each other's antagonist as they hunt for truth in very different ways. As an audience member it is up to you to decide which one is right. Villeneuve's direction and Guzikowski's script squeeze the themes to tears by covering each angle and every scene in opposing morality questions. At times these are deep but at others they feel forced, such as a priest who has killed a child killer to prevent him from continuing. This is here to be bleak, depressing and full of moral issues and it doesn't let up from that. Its pace is slow, the music dreary, the cinematography grey and wet, all adding to the tone of Villeneuve's piece. The script at times may feel 'on-the-nose' but it does raise these questions through it. Is it right to kill in order to prevent a killer, even if you are a priest? Added to the bleak tone are exceptional performances from Jackman and Gyllenhaal. Jackman portrays the grieving father with power and emotion leaving you unsure whether to route for him when he tortures the mentally confused suspect played by Paul Dano. At times his character is empathetic but at others he is frightening. This may become a problem if he was the hero to route for but instead during these scenes we promote Gyllenhaal's Loki to the forefront and it is his desperate search for the truth that we believe in. Gyllenhall also provides a wonderful performance as the Detective who suspects everyone until they are proved innocent. Both of these men can be seen as our protagonist but in reality neither of them are and instead the shared goal is what we route for. You may have a character you believe in but that all depends on which side of the fence you come down on.All in all Prisoners is a powerful movie, oozing in contemporary and moral issues. They are all prisoners in some way or another, even those fighting to put things right. At times the script laces these issues to the max, causing a few overly uncomfortable and expositional scenes but the gorgeous cinematography, towering performances and the cold atmosphere will have you leaving the theatre questioning what your move would be if you were ever in this position. This is not for the faint hearted and if you fancy a light popcorn entertainment film than Prisoners certainly isn't it.Rating: 4.5 / 5Directing: Villeneuve keeps the story's pace slow and adds more power from doing so.Acting: Strong performances from all involved with a star turn from Jackman.Script: A taut script that is let down slightly by nailing the themes too neatly.Cinematography: Deakins keeps it grey putting a shiver continually down the audience's spine.Score: Adds to the tone and engages you fully.Editing: Seamless. The slow pace remains constant and works. Overall: A thought provoking story that keeps you gripped throughout.",

            "content": "there are some things in this review you could see as spoilers.\"Prisoners\" is about Dover Keller. A caring and loving father with a daughter and a son. The movie starts of with Kellers family and Franklins having a thanksgiving celebration. This beginning gives a light tone to the movie. But it also gives you a warm feeling. Keller then tells his daughter and the daughter of Franklin that they should go and play in the basement. Hereafter the camera focuses on a tree while zooming in on it and there is scary movie on the background. (I know it sounds stupid but it is beautifully shot) After this scene you know that there is something wrong. And there is, both girls have disappeared. They have been kidnapped. Keller has to be one himself to find the girls, but that doesn't come with no trouble...The directing of the movie is just amazing, every shot was beautiful. The director (Denis Villeneuve) chose nice angles to shoot from and I also like that he used almost no hand held camera's. The realistic feel to the movie was also a fun feature. An example is the torture scene. This is a very thrilling scene, and this is due to the realistic tune. Like the make-up on the beaten face, and the blood on the knuckles of Keller. Very much enjoyed that the movie kept you on the edge of your seat during the entire movie. The cinematography of the movie was also amazing. The cinematographer was Roger Deakings. But I didn't really like the ending. It was an open ending and I never really like those. Nolan does these things normally too in his movies, but I don't mind it in his because the story has ended. In this movie you still are wondering how it goes on and you don't have that with Nolans movies. But \"prisoners\" was still goodThe acting in \"Prisoners\" was just flawless. Hugh Jackman as Dover Keller was very convincing as a loving dad. When he beats Alex Jones you can see the hate in his eyes, but there is also regret. This a way better performance by Jackman than in Wolverine. His character is very well written and due this you can also see how determined he is to find the two little girls. Jake Gyllenhaal was just amazing as a cop. But this wasn't really a surprise. You can see that he really wants to find the two girls but is hold back by the rules. This is something Keller doesn't seem to follow... Paul Dano as Alex was just the perfect casting choice. I just adored his character. He was the best written and developed character of the entire movie it was also brilliant acted. Even the child actors were good. Dylan Minnette as the son of Dover was really good. I very much liked the scene in the beginning of the movie where he and Eliza are talking about hunting, it was a very well written scene just like the entire movie. Terrance Howerd gave a very good performance. And Maria Bello was also very good as a worried and desperate mother. The script of the movie is just brilliantly written. And the last person I am going to talk about is Melissa Leo. She was just so good. She played an innocent women who is the mother of Alex.But now something more about the ending. I know that I have said that I didn't really like I, But the is just the final minutes. Because the last 30 minutes were very thrilling and exciting. I very much enjoyed the twist in the end. They made you think throughout the movie that Alex did it or Bob, but it turns out to be someone else. I really didn't see that twist coming.But overall this is an amazing movie and I am really surprised that it didn't get any Oscars. I would definitely recommend this movie to everyone.",

If you believe that suspects can shoot themselves while under custody at police stations and torturers can stay out of prison after being found out, then this movie might be for you, especially if you enjoy watching torture. They even throw in a pedophile priest who murders a murderer. After all Hollywood can never resist a slam at Catholicism given Hollywood's high moral compass. I rarely write reviews but this piece of crud is such a waste of time that I'm writing it for those people that enjoy Hugh Jackson (I like his stuff) and want to see a movie with him in it.

Though it is a kidnapping thriller, I feel that thrill is lesser, the torture is more and suspense is unnecessarily stretching for a long way. 2.33 hours movie is very lengthy to such an average plot. only last 20 minutes will entertains you with shocking twist and stupidly uncompleted end. I wonder to see 8.1 rating for such lengthy and mostly boring movie even good acting by Hugh Jackman. But me impressive acting done by Jake Gyllenhaal in the role of detective. Climax suspense revealing is not well justified. End is not clear. Overall It is a very slow kidnap drama with lesser thrill and more boring with extra dose of torture. One thing is also me bother that there is no good looking actress in such boring drama to relief you as there are at least a beautiful actress in almost every Hollywood boring movies.

            "content": "This is a tricky one. I'm going to try and avoid any form of spoiler so there'll be a certain amount of tip-toeing through the tulips. Denis Villeneuve's 2013 drama was released to widespread popular and critical acclaim.Hugh Jackman plays Kelly Dover, a survivalist minded yet ultimately decent man committed to protecting family from a hostile world. However, Dover is thrust into impotence when his daughter and her friend go missing. As the pressure mounts on the police to produce results Dover takes matters into his own hands.So, a great set-up. It looks great. All mute greys and dark brooding realism, but, it is shot by Roger Deakins so we would expect it to be visually fine. The characters are well drawn. The drama unfolds gradually and slowly over the first 90 minutes and is absorbing, gripping with the smack of truth. The performances are good (Maria Bello as the distraught mother and Gyllenhaal as the frustrated lead police investigator in particular). Maybe, it's being a father myself but I found Dover's sense of frustration and impotence at his inability to protect his family engrossing and the film asked some profound questions upon the line we draw for own limits and actions.However, everything collapses in the last third act as the film decides to get, well.... silly. All the good work done previously is undone as the plot takes a turn to the formulaic. It's as if the film-makers lost confidence in their set-up.The film switches tone from an engrossing drama into a rather silly police-procedural/ serial killer finale. From fine to formulaic in one movement. At one point I was expecting to hear, \"He puts the dog into the basket...\" The potential to be great dissolves away and the film becomes merely.... OK. Which is probably more of a crime than being rubbish. Ever get the feeling you've been cheated?",

But at some points the story is too slow for my taste,and then the ending was somewhat disappointing for me. I couldn't say that this movie is predictable and that you know from the start how it is going to end, but it has crossed my mind several times during the movie who the kidnapper is and turned out to be that i was right. All in all i would recommend it but with precaution and must point out once again that the movie is actually slow although a lot of people seem to think that every scene is important, i believe that they actually needed to cut some scenes and the story had to move faster.",

However, that would have detracted the focus of the movie. The constantly rainy and overcast weather also gave it a very depressing atmosphere that worked well with the nature of the plot. Melissa Leo and Paul Dano both impressed in their supporting roles. The use of some camera shots was very memorable with the way the framing. The framing of Paul Dano's character's eye in the shower stands out in terms of framing.

With Jake Gyllenhaal as a broody and forceful guide through the mystery, and Hugh Jackman invading Michael Shannon territory as a regular guy suddenly capable of terrible acts, there is a lot to enjoy in this cerebral thriller.Two little girls go missing while their families enjoy a Thanksgiving dinner. One father, Keller (Hugh Jackman), lets his frustration with events overtake him and decides to beat information out of the initial suspect. The moral dilemma of the film hinges on the fact that in order to stop the victimization of the innocent, Keller may be victimizing the innocent.The actors do the script justice, Terrence Howard as Franklin, the other father, being as soppy and indecisive as Keller is driven and unrelenting. Melissa Leo as Holly Jones displays a quiet power, the rock that can resist the crashing wave that is Keller's rage.As finely crafted as the script is, there are a few refrigerator questions, and some other questions that niggle before leaving the theatre. Detective Loki seems to be the only cop working the case. Actions by other cops are inferred, but the lack of briefings and incident room activity seems off-beat. Paul Dano as Alex Jones brings his calling card creepiness to the show, but this character is the most problematic, saying - or not saying - only what is required to complicate the plot in the most fiendish of ways. In the end, the characterisation here veers away from plausible toward mechanistic. His initial comment that lights Keller's touchpaper seems, on reflection, a shade too conveniently timed and phrased.These quibbles aside, it is refreshing to encounter a script that forces you to pay attention rather than spoon-feeding information, and has you asking questions and discussing the story, and the themes it invokes, for days after. Guzikowski is a screenwriter to watch out for.",

But just how far will he go to protect his family?Prisoners has the strongest ensemble cast of 2013 and everybody brings their A game. Keller Dover is Hugh Jackman's most raw and complex role yet, as Jackman plays Dover's wavering belief of the justice system and descending morality to a realistic precision. Things get murky as Dover takes matters in his own hands on an unconfirmed suspect Alex Jones (Paul Dano) and traps himself between being desperate, angry and helpless.Jake Gyllenhaal, sporting a neck tattoo and facial tics, creates the realistically compelling Detective Loki. The character is a fascinating inward look to how police detectives conduct their investigations, interrogate suspects and how the job centers on being emotionally removed from the crime itself. Loki is even darkly funny at times because he is so distanced from the crime and committed to procedures that normal things seem outlandish to him.Roger Deakins's cinematography brings layers of shades into the perpetually cloudy and otherwise flat-looking suburbia. The moody atmosphere embodies a sinister undertone; whether the location is a forest, a kitchen or a washroom, it feels like someone is lurking behind the corner. Mirroring its main characters, the cinematography impressively supports the story with a growing sense of insecurity.Denis Villeneuve directs ambitiously, as Prisoners juggles between being a character study of two families dealing with a kidnapping, a crime mystery plot and the theme of the institution versus the individual. Retrospectively, in total Alfred Hitchcock-coined \"refrigerator logic\" terms, the film does not entirely deliver on all three. Maria Bello, Viola Davis and Terrence Howard's characters do get sidetracked. The story thematically switches between whatever is the most interesting in the given moment, which in the moment is powerfully engaging.For more reviews, please visit my film blog @ http://hkauteur.wordpress.com",

Then the last half an hour or so happens and ... what on earth is this story? Why is some kind of silly B Movie plot thrown into this? I love B movies but this is not set up as a b movie, but as a very serious and dramatic thriller.It just feels so ridiculous at the end and some of the convenient plot leaps just leave me completely baffled and unsatisfied. Can anybody who praises this film actually justify the plot points of this movie? The girls escape. The priest. The criminal mastermind who is actually somewhat incompetent. Other things but I can't remember them anymore. I'm just scratching my head over this nonsense and I actually got angry and frustrated because I had such high high hopes for this movie.It's a shame because I love this director and this film has huge potential but the ludicrous plot brings down the fantastic Technical elements of the film.I particularly enjoyed Seeing Hugh Jackman get his teeth Into a darker role and he plays it very well.",

After watching the film I do understand why. \"Prisoners\" is way too long movie (153 minutes) - almost like compiled TV mini-series - with lot of plot problems from the various twists and turns shown in the film. Movie isn't bringing much new to the tradition of crime thrillers and missing children horror stories too. The film's best quality is the atmosphere, while actors like Terrence Howard, Viola Davis, Paul Dano, Melissa Leo and Maria Bello are wasted, mainly due to thin characterization. An ineffective ending leaves you with the feeling of wasted time, too. In terms of a recommendation, it's a borderline call. On second viewing (year after) I realized that I forgot almost whole movie which means that, no matter how engrossing story is, its too familiar script makes you not to memorize it. I did like it of first viewing (Rating: 7) but on second (Rating: 6-) I did realized how much script holes, gimmick acting, underwhelming script it had. At the end, it is just an another cheap pulp detective story with A-list actors.Rating: 7-/6 (Just because of Jake Gyllenhaal too much blinking and sadistically Hugh Jackman too much raving)",

Having just watched \"Prisoners\", I was surprised to see that Villeneuve directed it. I was also disappointed. I won't deny that it's a very intense movie, but I will say that the dads' actions seem excessive. It looks like the sorts of things that Liam Neeson now does in movies (and his current characters seem to be based on Harrison Ford's characters). I'll admit that I didn't figure out what was going to happen as the movie progressed, but that doesn't make up for the extreme actions taken by the dads. The point is that this is not a movie that I recommend. In addition to the director, each of the main cast members has done better movies.",

            "content": "Prisoners - 9/10 Superb film. Great story-line, pacing, acting. It has it all. After I finished watching it, I remarked that it was the best film I've seen in a long time. And I've seen a lot. A simplistic plot summary is this: 2 girls go missing near their homes and a frantic search for them primarily from parent Hugh Jackman and detective Jake Gyllenhaal begins. The raw, rough landscape - the washed out grays and browns in the picture - the cold, the rain: all help to make the atmosphere of the film, one of realism and desperation. There are a few red herrings thrown in here and there as we progress (or so I thought) but ultimately they all somehow connect (however tenuously in places). As I watched the film, some things happened which I could not see how they related to the overall plot - but a second watch helped out a lot in this regard. Some elements of the film were a little strange but the storyteller didn't skimp on content that's for sure. He threw everything at this and although richly populated and seemingly unconnected at times - it all adds up in the end. Barely. But it adds up nonetheless. So huge credit is due to the storyteller and the director for bringing us something a little different, a little left-field but the most credit must go to the two main actors. I've never seen Jackman in anything except Wolverine (not even the X-Men series - but just the spin off) and he is what he is in that movie - a mutant wolf-like creature/human. He does pretty well as this - but I must admit I had no idea of his acting chops. Well, here he shows us in spades. He's angry, riled, tired, exhausted, violent, desperate - at times all in the one scene - and portrays it brilliantly. A little OTT with the wild eyes in one or two scenes - but that is being picky. He held that pent-up and at times unleashed anger throughout the film expertly. But even Jackman was outdone by Gyllenhaal. Now I have seen a lot of this guy's films ever since his breakthrough in Donnie Darko. He is good. Getting better. And has a massive future ahead of him. He can do anything in my opinion, he has it all. Here, he brings a weird edge to detective Loki - with his neck tattoo, his mason ring, his weird haircut, buttoned up shirts and general worldliness. He is a character that without knowing anything about his background or personal life, comes across as a dangerous, slightly unhinged individual with a troubled past, and maybe an even more conflicting future. But for now, he's a cop and a damn good one. Gyllenhaal even gives this guy a tick - with the constant eye-blinking - which simply adds to his mystique. Tremendous, faultless acting by Gyllenhaal makes him a wonder to watch.Not to mention great turns by a creepy Paul Dano and another misfit David Dastmalchian. Both extremely convincing and off-putting in equal measure. Also, an early outing for Dylan Minnette - now, the excellent Clay Jensen from 13 Reasons Why. In short - great movie - and without giving away the ending too much - a clincher to finish. A must-see.",

The story, the plot, the screenplay, the acting, the direction, the set everything is perfect and is comparable only to the legendary 'Silence of the lambs'. I generally do not dare to compare any movie to the later but i am just compelled to mention this here. For a movie to be this good everything has to come together. If the story does not pack the punch than no matter how many dollars the producer spends on the movie it can't become legendary. Prisoners is an excellent story which is fully complemented by the acting performances of Jackman, Gyllenhaal and every other cast member. Paul Dano (little miss sunshine) who plays the character Alex is worth a special mention here. He plays a disturbed kid in this movie and is essential to the maintenance of suspense and he does it seamlessly. I urge you to watch this movie in the theaters. It makes sense to encourage and appreciate brilliance which today is so rare in the movie business.",

Jake Gyllenhaal delivers one of his best performances in a long time (I'm tempted to say since Brokeback Mountain, seriously), as his Detective Loki was the right amount of measured intensity and anguish. Conversely, Hugh Jackman's performance, while good, is just a little over the top. An emotionally powerful performance doesn't always involve screaming at the top of your lungs in every scene and unfortunately that's the lasting impression I had from him here. I also found the story suffered from a few too many plot holes in my opinion. Having said that, the director did a fantastic job of creating a dark, cold, dreadful atmosphere that permeated the film and really created a sense of despair. Overall, I would say this is worth seeing, especially for Gyllenhaal's underrated performance alone.Enjoyed my review? Keep in touch! Blog: www.themoviesnob.ca Twitter: @the_movie_snob",

Director Denis Villeneuve and writer Aaron Guzikowski know their beans when it comes to understanding what make our well-meaning but sometimes very sick society tick. The cast is deep and talented. Hugh Jackman's frantic father adds yet another dimension to the seemingly endless capabilities of this actor. Maria Bello, Viola Davis and Terence Howard as the other parents involved in the developing tragedy are contained, believable and never anything but excellent. Jake Gyllenhaal's typically realistic, understated turn as the skeptical cop is perfect counterpoint. Paul Dano's hapless nut case almost steals the show, and Melissa Leo's turn as his \"keeper\" is downright frightening. I recommend this film without reservation. And Oscars _ wake up!",

I will not give you a synopsis so you can still watch the film without knowing the full story.\"Prisoners\" attempts to transform a story about a neighborhood kidnapping into something more than just a crime film. When a member of your family becomes a victim of a crime, you will be imprisoned in your own sense of justice. It becomes a thought-provoking film which makes you question your own sense of morality.The atmosphere created by Director Denis Villeneuve is dark and heavy from the first frame, as Hugh Jackman intones the Lord's Prayer. The cold November rainy weather sets the mood very well. However, two and half hours of a relentlessly downcast mood can take its toll on the audiences. I did feel that the film lost its bearings somehow when scalding showers and snakes entered the scene.Whatever missteps of the story and direction is made up for by the talented actors who try their best to bring this turgid story to life. It becomes a compelling drama, better than what it may have appeared on paper. The stellar Oscar-caliber stars bring their A-game to this.Hugh Jackman is explosive here as Keller Dover, the parent with the more extreme reaction to the crime against his family. He is clearly in Wolverine mode here as he gets caught up in his own warped vigilantism. He goes over-the-top in a lot of disturbing scenes, but it was that quiet moment when he recognizes a bloody item of clothing that was his best scene.Jake Gyllenhaal does very well as the dedicated officer in charge of the case, with a name as unlikely as Detective Loki. His best scene is when he was driving through the freeway in the pouring rain with a bleeding wound on his head further distorting his vision, rushing to bring a dying person to the hospital.Maria Bello plays Keller's unstable wife, trapped by her own addiction to sleeping pills. I do not like her past work, but here she was actually good despite her irritating character. Terrence Howard and Viola Davis play the Birches, close friends of the Dovers. They are generally calm people but circumstances force them to turn a blind eye and even become accomplices to another crime.Paul Dano plays a mentally-challenged guy named Alex Jones. He somehow gets us to feel for his creepy character. Melissa Leo plays his adoptive mother Holly. Their behavior will keep you guessing as to their involvement in the case on hand.Overall, this can be a very compelling film that will keep you guessing. However, this is a lengthy, deliberately slow paced film. Despite its good intentions, I feel that it could have been edited into something less meandering and repetitive. A film like this dragged too long is bound to give rise to questionable plot devices and bad red herrings, and this one unfortunately has both.",

Like MYSTIC RIVER, this is a film that has an icy gloom about it, with broken, unlikeable characters, murky cinematography, and a relentlessly grim storyline. It's the sort of film you watch and then go and have a cold shower afterwards in a bid to get rid of some of the ickiness.Sadly, the storyline of this film is a very predictable one that borrows heavily from other movies, and originality seems to be in very short supply. The first half of the picture involves child abduction and revenge and seems to have been borrowed from the B-movie THE TORTURED, although thankfully it's not quite as graphic as that film; it's still nasty, though. The second film turns into a police procedural triller with nods to ZODIAC as a grim-faced Jake Gyllenhaal wanders around trying to piece together clues.On top of all this, at two and a half hours PRISONERS is overlong and rather stodgy. The only thing it has going for it is the A-list cast, which lifts the material quite considerably. Hugh Jackman is fine in a serious role, and we know Gyllenhaal can do this sort of thing in his sleep. Terrence Howard, Maria Bello, Viola Davis, Paul Dano, and Melissa Leo are all solid too. It's just a shame the material is so below par given the ratings.",

So, my review will not be about the story of the film, but the bad comments about the film.I would like to tell something about the comments related with the runtime of the film. In some reviews it is told that the film is too long and that is one of the reasons that they don't like it. I really do my best to understand why people judge a film with its runtime, but I cant. Cinema is the art of telling a story on the white big screen. If you need long time to tell a story, then you do it in that way. The success of a film does not depend on the runtime, gentlemen. You may say that you didn't like the film, it is that easy, but the runtime itself can not be an excuse not to like a film unless you don't make a short film. (You know short films tell the story in the shortest time as much as possible, that is why they call them as short film, but \"Prisoners\" is not one of them)The reasons that I like \"Prisoners\":1. It didn't MAKE ME FEEL that IT WAS TOO LONG. It means it took my attention from the beginning to the end.2. Techincally, I like the art directing, especially color grading and the usage of cameras.3. The acting is not as bad as some say. I don't know if you expect an exaggerated acting or not, but the acting is AT LEAST AVAGARE, but not worse than it!4. For the questions like \"why did he do this, why did he do that? why did it happen like this?\": I would like to remind that in every story telling you can find or make up a problem if you want to. All right, I agree with the people who think that there are some missing or nonsense parts in the story, but keep in mind that it is a film and even the best films can have knowingly or unknowingly have such problems. (Some friends of mine told me that they didn't like the masterpiece \"Crouching Tiger and Hidden Dragon\" directed by Ang Lee as people in the film were flying while they were fighting and they thought that this was nonsense. What can I do except laughing?) On the other hand, would you like it more if all questions were answered and not kept as secret? It changes from person to person, but i would not like it personally...5. Some say that they didn't like the end though it was so clean (sometimes you don't need to see the end to know how it ends). Moreover, some film makers knowingly leave the end to the person himself, so, if you cant be sure how it ends, work your imagination and let the film end in the way you wish.6. Some say that it is the worst film they have seen in 2013. Shame on you! Please respect to the people who gave effort and spent money to bring it to the white big screen. It is not a masterpiece but not a bad film, either. Do you seriously think that it is the worst film of the year? If so, I have nothing to tell you except that I collect real bad films as they have a great value in film making, but I can say that this is not one of them.As a result, it took 8/10 from me.Best Regards.",

He does a great job in this and definitely has the best performance in the film. One of his best ever honestly. Some of his scenes are just insane. Jake Gyllenhaal is also very good and plays his role to near perfection as does Paul Dano. But, Jackman steals the show. Scene to scene every actor gave a heightened level of drama to their performances which really enhanced the film. The screenplay is extremely well written also.The filmmaking is gritty and there is great cinematography, editing, and incredible dialogue. The performances in this movie are top-notch. I thought the filmmaking was beautiful and it is consistently riveting and tense.One thing I noticed that I didn't necessarily like was that the movie chooses to cut at moments of high tension very frequently. Like right when it's super tense and something is about to happen the movie cuts and takes you somewhere else leaving you wondering what happened. This happens multiple times and sometimes it works well but others it can come off as frustrating. The movie is pretty slow.Overall, I thought Prisoners was a great movie and I recommend watching it. The filmmaking is beautiful and the story is very real and amazingly written and acted. It is not a super original premise, but the way it is executed was fantastic. I thought the ending was perfect.",

To summarize, 2 families kids are abducted and the race to save them before they are found dead or never seen again. Hugh Jackman is the father who goes to extreme measures to find the missing kids. Jake Gyllenhaal is the detective in the film who does what he can to aid the search and find these kids. The acting in the film is really good especially Jackman and J. Gyllenhaal. It's a tense film from beginning to the end. The film is almost 2 hours and 30 minutes which is way past my attention span for a movie but for some odd reason I couldn't stop watching. This could have been a 10 star rating but my main issue was the ending. Not sure if other reviews mentioned it but I do feel they could've brought some closure to the situation as a whole. Besides that one of the best movies I have seen all year. 9/10",

            "content": "I will start off saying I was very apprehensive going into \"The Prisoners\", I have personally never been a fan of Gyllenhaal's acting I always found his style to be boring. Hugh Jackman on the other hand I am a huge fan of being a lover of X-Men for roughly half of my life.Hugh Jackman in this film was truly a spectacle to behold, he commands the screen with every second he is on it, his performance as a broken father really resonates with the audience, he really makes you pull at your own moral compass. How far would we truly go to save our blood, Jake Gyllenhaal gives an equally as good performance as Detective Loki (yes his name really is that cool). Gyllenhaal is equally as powerful. He incredibly embodies the troubled detective void of his emotions, culminating in real feeling ticks and twitches you begin to feel really embody the characters progression.I would personally say it is career best performances from Jackman and Gyllenhall, but that is to not take away from the rest of the cast, Terrance Howard is truly back to the quality of acting that won him his Academy Award nomination for \"Hustle & Flow\" and the performance he gave in \"Crash\". While Paul Dano might not have had as much screen time as some of the other actors, he was truly superb playing the emotionally and intellectually stunted Alex Jones who is said to have the IQ of ten year old.While the film is not entirely perfect, Denis Villeneuve makes and incredible film for his Hollywood debut and first English language film. His use of tension building is second to none in recent years, \"edge of the seat\" stuff in a understatement, you start at the edge of your seat, by the end of the film you are on the floor. It has a wonderful noir feel to the film, and the use of Roger Deakins' cinematography was a true spectacle to behold, his work has been nominated for twelve Academy Awards so he is doing something right.Aaron Guzikowski writes some of the most enjoyable scenes I have seen in a thriller film for a long time, it is hard to believe that he is so early in his writing career considering his amazing grasp of twists and turns and brings a true mystery to the audience. There is a few moments of the film that are predictable but that happens with ANY film written, however for a relative newcomer Guzikowski is superb in his work.Overall, the film a truly a roller coaster ride of emotions that will keep you enticed from start to the end filled with powerful performances from the entire cast. The film does have a pretty long running time which may scare a few people off, but I assure you it is worth the long watch, that is if you are open to some violence and a few torture based scenes. If you get passed these aspects you will be in for a treat of a wonderfully shot, brilliantly directed and beautifully acted film by the leads.",

This is a tough but rewarding film to sit through and the pacing is good- you will be transfixed throughout.

So, if you're in the mood for that (and don't have young children!), you'll find a decent enough thriller with powerful performances from both Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal (who plays the cop in charge of the subsequent investigation).It's quite a long film (over two hours), so don't expect everything to be revealed at once.The only drawback is that, mainly towards the end, there are a few 'ploy holes' which the writers obviously think you'll probably overlook as you're caught up in the drama of the final act. If you don't look too closely and focus on the performances, you should still enjoy what is really a pretty bleak movie.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",

Easy option? Easy target? I wonder if they'd also considered making the paedophile from another - particular - 'religion'...? Methinks not!Alex is described as having \"the IQ of a 10-year-old\". This is incorrect and an irrelevance. Children are IQ-graded relative to the population at their particular developmental level. This doesn't mean that *all* children have a lower IQ than adults. In fact, IQ actually *lowers* with age. So, some children will have a higher IQ than many adults. What they should've described Alex as is retarded or having learning disabilities.When Alex went missing, why didn't the police put a tail on the two fathers immediately? They took their time to figure it out. Surely it would be most obvious the likelihood right away.The film becomes very, very slow from the final hour or so. It thus becomes unnecessarily long... could easily have been done in 1.5 hours rather than the whopping 2.5 hours.The police don't seem to be able to put 2+2 together. The father goes missing after he's told by Joy that he was near them at one point, and yet the police - finally discovering that the old woman was the abductor - still doesn't figure out that just maybe he'd gone to the old woman's house and gotten into trouble.Also why, at no point, do the police not use sniffer dogs??? For this story, the mystery would've been solved very quickly.The acting is reasonably good but, I think, later suffers a little due the unnecessarily long length of the film.

It's a story of a horrible kidnapping and those who are affected. It's told with such compassion and believability. The characters make excruciating choices --choices that make you shake your head in stunned wonder. And the cast! Jake Gyllenhaal, Hugh Jackman, Maria Bello, Viola Davis, Terrence Howard, Melissa Leo, and Paul Dano! How much acting chops can one get on a movie set? And the screenplay is superb.

            "content": "Prisoners (2013)Prisoners is a psychological thriller film directed by Denis Villeneuve. The movie has an ensemble cast including Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Viola Davis, Maria Bello, Terrence Howard, Melissa Leo, and Paul Dano.Firstly, I talk about the plot, which focuses on a child kidnapping of two young girls and the subsequent search of the abductor. The father of the missing child is pretty disappointed about the rather small progress the police made in matters of finding his daughter - thus he decides to start his own investigations. Consequently the viewer is able to observe a race between the police and a vigilante.Of course, Villeneuve is famous for his brilliant staging. The way, how Villeneuve tells a story is just different. The viewer feels great understanding and empathy towards the different characters, besides the antagonist. Villeneuve know exactly how to convey various emotions of different characters. Moreover, all events are very exciting. As a viewer you really want to know who is the abductor and why he/she did it.Paul Dano, who portrays is suspected to be the abductor, acts brilliant. His character is shy, anxious and doesn't talk a lot. Dano's character ransoms different feelings to the viewer. As first the spectator detests him and later on commiserates with him.Also, Hugh Jackman who performs as the vigilante, is vitriolic and frustrated. We see the psychological repercussions of a child abduction. How it effects the different characters is very interesting. Especially on Jackman's character. In his performances we see multiple effects of child abduction.The music, which is composed by the late J\u00f3hann Gunnar J\u00f3hannsson, who already composed multiple soundtracks for Villeneuve movies, is extraordinary. His composition fulfills every scene. Most scenes are dark and depressing. The music brings in a sad and dejected undercurrent, therefore the scenes have a bigger impact. Even for the viewer it gets depressing and glum.All in all, Prisoners is one of the best psychological thrillers over the past 20 years. For me it's also one of Villeneuve best movies.",

Prisoners takes on religious undertones, without forcing any biblical views on the audience. It simply shows, religious or not, how any human is capable of having a dark side. Thanksgiving Day, the Dover's (Hugh Jackman, Maria Bello, Dylan Minnette, and Erin Gerasimovich) and the Birches (Terrence Howard, Viola Davis, Zoe Borde, and Kyla Drew Simmons) eat their nicely prepared meal, in their cozy home, cuddled up in the suburbs. After dinner both of the young daughters Anna Dover (Erin Gerasimovich) and Joy Birch (Kyla Drew Simmons) decide to go play outside. After a few hours, the parents begin their search, with no results, they call 911. Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) is brought on as lead detective, and his prime suspect is Alex (Paul Dano), a fully grown man, with the intelligence of a ten year old boy. The film has the best cast that I've seen all year. You get Hugh Jackman giving his most impressing role of his career. The intensity that Jackman brings to such a loving family man is nothing short of genius, he hits every major note perfectly. Maria Bello is also quite remarkable as Jackman's grieving wife. Its also nice to see Terrence Howard in a role where he is not a dominant male. Howard is extremely soft spoken in this film, and his vulnerability gets to shine through. Viola Davis hits another one out of the park. I believe you could throw Viola Davis into anything and she would make it better.Jake Gyllenhaal also gives one of his top three performances of his career as the constantly blinking detective that has never had a case go unsolved. At first the blinking was slightly distracting, but after a few scenes, you can see that Gyllenhaal has fully committed to the blink, it becomes just a twitch that the character has developed over his life. Its truly stunning work.Paul Dano gives his most memorable role since There Will Be Blood, which is way more of a show-offy, bombastic type roll than his character of Alex in Prisoners where he is shy, more reserve, and chooses his words carefully. Alex's Aunt is played by Melissa Leo whom along with the rest of the cast, gives an extremely brilliant, breathtaking performance. This is Denis Villeneuve's first American film and let me tell you that its more pleasing then ever. The only flaw with the film, in my opinion, is that it runs about fifteen to twenty minutes too long. But thats just a minor flaw amongst the insanely talented cast, eerie cinematography and a well written screenplay. I give Prisoners a 9 out of 10.",

            "content": "I watched this several days ago and have been mulling over it ever since. The gist of it is that two girls are abducted, and all signs point to a mentally disabled man, Alex Jones (a spectacularly creepy Paul Dano), being the culprit. He's arrested by Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal), but a lack of evidence swiftly finds Jones back on the street. Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman), the father of one of the girls, isn't convinced of Jones's innocence, and he vows to do whatever is necessary to bring the girls home. Villeneuve's thriller is anything but fast-paced (it runs for a whopping two and a half hours), but it's certainly never boring. The inflated running time allows for greater character development (specifically of Loki and Keller Dover), and invites us to dwell on the moral ambiguities of Dover's quest. Dover has good reason to suspect Jones, but he goes to extreme means to make him talk, to the extent that even his co-conspirators find themselves questioning his actions.I was immediately reminded of Taken, but whereas Taken might be the Death Wish of the child abduction genre, this is a more grounded and disturbing take on the material. There are extreme acts of violence and torture in this film, much like in Taken, but we're never invited to enjoy the spectacle, and the more horrific acts are mostly implied. At the same time we can understand why Keller does what he does (at one point his wife tearfully says, \"you always made me feel so safe,\" the unspoken accusation being that he failed as the protector of his family), and find it difficult to condemn him. At a time when films can be so preachy concerning matters of morality, it's refreshing to see a movie that raises these questions without being so pretentious as to think there's a simple answer.While tackling such hard-hitting themes as the destruction of a man's soul and child abuse, it thankfully also functions as a riveting mystery. The contemplative pacing and the convoluted mystery (Loki pursues several leads, each of which appear to be dead ends) make this feel more novel-like (indeed, I was surprised to discover this was an original screenplay), but as in all good mystery novels the seemingly disconnected narrative threads are tied together beautifully in the last act. I only wonder if perhaps the solution to the mystery, as well as the motivation behind the abductions, is a little too far-fetched and over-the-top for its own good. In any case, it didn't massively detract from my enjoyment.I need not point out Roger Deakins's Oscar-nominated cinematography, but the cast is worth discussing. I've always liked Hugh Jackman, but I rarely like his movies, so it's a pleasure to see him in something that I feel is worth his time. He gives it his all here, and he is at turns heartrending and frightening as the tormented vigilante father. Jake Gyllenhaal is likewise quite good as Detective Loki, and he retains our sympathy even after making some incredibly boneheaded decisions. The grand prize, however, must go to Paul Dano for his seriously creepy yet understated performance. I don't want to spoil too much, but his soft-spoken, seemingly simpleminded character compares favorably with that of Richard Attenborough in 10 Rillington Place.I'll end this rambling review by noting something I haven't seen mentioned in other reviews. The final scene bears a fascinating resemblance to certain scenes from two different films by Lucio Fulci: Seven Notes in Black and City of the Living Dead. For anyone who hasn't yet watched this (which you should, immediately!), I'd rather not spoil it by describing them, but in the case of the latter film in particular it's almost uncanny. I can't help but wonder whether the writer or director follow Fulci's work. I was also frequently reminded of Duccio Tessari's superlative, heartrending thriller Death Occurred Last Night, which likewise sees a detective and an enraged, heartbroken father racing to locate the person or persons who abducted his daughter. In any case, Prisoners certainly brings plenty of its own unique qualities to the table. I wouldn't call it a classic, but it leaves a lasting impact, which is more than I can say for a lot of films I've watched recently.",

Some of the actors portray their despair very convincingly (most of the time Hugh Jackman) and you can understand they are desperate to do anything. Jackman's character turns into a kidnapper himself to save his daughter from the very same thing. What he does isn't morally ambiguous at all, he straight turns into a psychopath. Maybe the black parents' behavior of inaction counts as riding a fine moral line. I expected the movie would do more with that. We are shown a scene when Jackman starts praying \"Our Father\" and struggles at the line \"forgive us our sins, as we forgive those who sin against us\". The only thing that came close to a conclusive moment is that his daughter's abductor was also formerly religious, then lost faith. The payoff fell a bit flat, as did the ending scene.",

            "content": "Prisoners explores the various talents and relies on its leads Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal, and they deliver great performances in this suspenseful crime thriller. It's Thanksgiving in suburban Pennsylvania when two little girls go missing. Jackman is riveting as Keller Dover, a tightly wound, deeply religious, and apocalyptically inclined survivalist father of 6-year-old Anna. Bello, as his wife Grace, is less prone to the creeping, religiously tinged paranoia, but utterly believable in her shroud of shattered normalcy.Also missing is 7-year-old Joy, the daughter of next-door neighbors Franklin and Nancy Birch (Howard and Davis). Gyllenhaal is the twitchy, blinking Detective Loki, who is called in to investigate, and Dano plays a mysterious RV-driving drifter who has mental health issues and is quickly nabbed as the obvious suspect. But, as in the aforementioned Zodiac (which also starred Gyllenhaal), few things are what they at first seem.Prisoners runs at 153 minutes but watching and paying close attention, the film does not feel nearly as long, and every minute within the second half is entertaining, and gripping. Much complaint at how the ending's last 20-30 minutes are but I am in agreement that it is not therefore predictable but a lasting touch. There are several clues that are shown before then, and it is a great watch to see the final end result.",

Starring Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Terrence Howard and Viola Davis Prisoners is a thrilling ride that will leave you on the edge of your seat.Prisoners really shows why good cinematography can be the difference in a movie hitting or missing and this is a testament to Roger Deakin's skill behind the camera. Which even though we sit through two and half hours the audience rarely feels bored and is always begging for more clues to eventually solve the case. This is also one of those films where there is no villain throughout we see everyone become the bad guy, become the helpless maniac that will stop at nothing to get whatever they want. Throughout you will uncover what really a prisoner means. If you thought Wolverine wasn't angry and ruthless enough in the X-Men films that should be all dispelled as you see the struggle of Jackman (Keller Dover) as he desperately searches to find his daughter.The only thing I would've wanted to see more was of the other characters and how they dealt with the loss of the two children but otherwise the audience couldn't stop but feel challenged by the story displayed. Prisoners is not for the faint hearted though as your morals will seriously be challenged and you may feel guilty inside. This is not one of those films were you go prancing out about how cool it is but it will surely impact you in some way.Rating: A+ Comment: If you don't think Wolverine (Jackman) was ruthless enough in the X-Men films expect that to be dispelled while watching this.",

Seldom have I watched a movie where I ended up hating practically every character shown. In terms of depressing finale this movie even beats \"funny games\" since I actually started rooting for the so called \"bad guys\". What scares me is that most people don't grasp how morally repulsive this movie really is. It makes me scared of todays society when movies like this one gets an 8.1 average rating and most people actually think that the end justifies the means, and that police brutality, torture, sadism, suicide, assault, retaliation are stuff you can be OK with if there only is a suspicion of a crime. Don't get me wrong, I've grown up with the Dirty Harry and Death Wish movies, and they didn't leave me upset at all. I even enjoyed them. Junkfood for the brain. At least in those movies they catch the bad guys in the act most of the times. But this movie is disgusting. I've got nothing against it portraying selfish, egoistic evil psychopaths and unprofessional people, but it's the moral stand that it takes in the end that makes it awful. They deliberately edit out the scene where Detective Loki finds the tortured and mentally disabled Alex. And everything is immediately forgiven as long as you have committed the right type of sins. During the 2 and a half hours they showed so much egoistic sadistic violence by \"the good guys\" that I even ended up hoping the girls would be dead. You don't care about them anyway since their characters aren't developed in the story. All crimes should be punished in this movie, not just the ones that media decides are the worst. At least 3 of the parents deserved jail-time, probably all four. The detective should've been suspended if not prosecuted for the way he handled that interrogation. Even the captain was at fault. If the movie showed good police work and real heroes this movie would've gotten an 8. You can't have a morality tale with an hypocritical message. As entertainment it's OK but it's dangerous entertainment and you should never forget that. 3 out of 10.",

At the end I thought back over the film to see how objects, people, and other things were connected to what occurred. I didn't even understand why and how things occurred or were connected which created a lot of discussion afterwards. My partner and I shared our thoughts of what we understood; it took both of us to make sense of it all. Good writing and that correct application of it certain shows when it takes two educated people to understand everything.This film also made me think about justice and what I would do: is the law always correct? Should we take the law into our own hands? Are laws too black and white? Whether intended or not this opens a dialogue about right and wrong, trusting police, and rational thinking.",

But then a tragedy strikes, as the younger daughters of the families both disappear while playing outside. And from this setting we get one of the most cynical takes on human desperation I've seen in a long time.There are no perfect individuals in Prisoners, no easy answers or moral rightness. Most of the characters react to the stress of the situation in a very ugly manner, and you don't really side with any of them. But you're not supposed to. The purpose of this film is to show us that even normal, so called upstanding citizens are capable of horrifying actions under the right conditions. It's a story about desperation, human weakness, despair, stress and hopelessness. It's an excellent story, but it's not nice to watch. Set your expectations accordingly.It's also a very impressive movie on a technical level. Cinematography, the tone and the whole feel of darkness in the film are all topnotch. The actors are also phenomenal. Hugh Jackman gives one of his best performances in a while as the despairing, enraged father of one of the girls. Most of the tale is told from his perspective, and his blight is heartbreaking to witness. Jake Gyllenhaal is also very, very good in his role as an ace police detective, who for first time in his career might face a case he cannot solve. The supporting cast is also talented, though Terrence Howard, the father of the other girl, just doesn't have the sheer presence to stand next to Jackman as an equal. But he tries.Prisoners is a dark, distressing thriller that is not an easy journey to take, but is definitely worth it for those that can deal with its world view. Definitely not recommended if you're just looking to have fun and spend an evening, but if you're looking for something heavier and more meaningful, this is worth keeping in mind.",

Director Denis Villeneuve has skilfully utilized Hugh Jackman's and Jake Gyllenhaal's skills, and supporting actors like Paul Dano or Viola Davis are always a firm choice. Tensions are high, viewers can ponder about guilt and remorse, gray and rainy background boosts anxiety...

It's a gritty film (and I get it), but please give me a break! An experienced writer would be able to lighten up the mood and that is a must from time to time.Now, the inconsistencies, silly red herrings and just plain stupidity: Why would the child killer go to confess to a priest when his faith dwindled after his son died and they waged war against God? The priest confirmed that the killer was \"bragging\" \u2013 so what is exactly the point of going to the priest? Does not sound like a confession issue to me. Fail Why didn't they get the priest to do a photofit and connect the dots that way? If you kill a man you sure remember at least something of him? Why didn't the maverick detective think about the old Auntie's husband going missing all those years ago and perhaps make some sort of connection? Nah, it's not good for the plot. Fail The same maverick detective-solved-all-the-cases finds everything out by chance \u2013 by chance he sees the cable sticking out from behind a cupboard which (surprise, surprise!) is hiding a secret entrance to a secret basement and the priest never even thought of getting rid of the body. Then, by chance again, the maverick detective shoves all the stuff on the floor from his desk and voila! \u2013 A clue again! Fail Why did Hugh Jackman's character need to beat the retarded Alex \u2013 when the genius detective interviewed him, it seemed the phobia of human touch did the job? Plus, Keller never got anything out of Alex although Alex's capable \u2013 when the plot requires \u2013 to utter a completely coherent and revealing sentence. Also, everybody would of course believe the retard but not the father trying to find his missing child. Where was surveillance? Oh, my next point \u2013 the whole police force consists of the genius detective, his superior with an office, a couple of administrative guys and a forensic team of 2 \u2013 get outta here! The genius detective does not only seem to have no training but lacking in common sense as well \u2013 why would you not close the first snake box and let the snakes get out whilst you're opening other boxes? This is just idiotic. Fail Everybody seem to be talking in riddles \u2013 the girl that escaped utters \"you were there\", everybody seem to hear it, see Keller run out like mad, but for the plot purposes, nobody reacts. Instead of questioning the girl (who, we've just witnessed, can actually speak!), they just stand around in a friendly circle. Fail Keller goes to the auntie's house knowing full well that she's a serial killer and (one in such extreme situation would gather) \u2013 very dangerous. He TURNS HIS BACK to her and mutters a threat. For what I know, she could have knocked him out with a frying pan at that point. Fail The evil Auntie, weirdly, seems to be repeating every command twice \u2013 open the drawer x 2, get in the car x 2, everything's repeated twice \u2013 are the writers short of words? What's going on? Fail Oh, and a note to the director \u2013 try cutting the scenes down or eliminate the ones with people just walking down the hospital corridors \u2013 may add urgency to the pace and people would not doze off whilst watching a 2.5 hour film the story of which does not warrant this length.The list goes on.

            "content": "SPOILERSThey threw the movie away in the third act! A very competently-made, suspenseful piece, albeit with some of the whiff of anxiety-exploitation around child abduction that, say, The Pledge has, but impressively and seriously put together. A lot of the revelations are guessable, but it'll keep you watching. Yet - in the end - you may wish you'd spent your time watching something else. Because it doesn't pay off.There are many holes, but one key howler.For me, the film makers threw it all away with one piece of \"let's go down to that spooky graveyard\" plotting. With a jigsaw puzzle this intricate, everything has to be plausible or it all feels like a confection. And when Hugh Jackman runs off - alone, actively avoiding the police and preventing them from accompanying him - to confront the abductor, after learning a key piece of information in the hospital, all credibility goes out the window. HJ's character (Dover) simply has no reason to eschew the police's help once he learns that he has already been at the place where the children are being held. (Which narrows the options right down).The discovery of one of the missing girls changes everything. And acting on evidence gleaned from her is not something the police would resist. A bunch of talented actors and film makers let all their efforts go to waste due to this failure of plotting and motivation. It takes you right out of the movie. Of course, the whistle contrivance eventually makes it feel as if maybe this action doesn't seal Dover's fate (though the ending's ambiguity is a bit of a cop out). But - crucially - this piece of implausible action means that by the end we've kind of bailed.As for the aftertaste, the more you think about it, the more the 'plausible offscreen action' on which this kind of plot and edit relies, is inadequate.If you watch the flashback, which shows the first captive escaping, carefully you'll see that nasty Melissa Leo is held back by a hooded figure, which is how the little girl gets away. We see beige-hooded-coat-guy grab her from behind as she pursues the little girl, and then cut to the girl running and running.Now, there's only one beige hoodie guy in the film - it's creepy Bob Taylor, who by the time we see the flashback, has killed himself in police custody.So: why? Why did he kill himself? And/or why did he help little Joy Birch escape?If he meant for her to escape, why not just tell the cops and be a hero?And if he feels guilty enough to kill himself (why?), what was his motivation to save the girl?None of this is made even remotely clear.We could speculate that it's because he's a loon due to long exposure to LSD (if we think he's another abductee of Melissa Leo's character and her late husband - and this is suggested by the snakes he had; Leo's character says her husband kept snakes). Or maybe he feels guilty that he only managed to help one girl flee.But at this point in the story all he has to give is factual account of what happened and he'd be OK.Likewise, why does Alex withhold the information?Presumably we're supposed to presume that Holly Jones (Leo) had some intense brainwashy psychological hold over both boys. But that's a lot of presuming.So, the plot holes got in the way here. And, as is often the case, the film-makers papered over the cracks with some ambiguity and vagueness which the less discerning will take for artful and intentional ambiguity which makes the film soooo much more interesting.But it's not. It's just shoddy plotting dressed up.",

And why didn't the police officer get the phone records for the suspect. It would have shown he called home that evening.How did they get taken? Simple - He called home and told her two girls were walking on the street. She came right over and he came out an invited the girls into the RV with a strong leer. They shrank away and the woman came up and comforted them and threatened the man with the police (to get their trust). She then offered to drive them home and that was that.More incompetent police work happened when the cop sat in the rain watching the loud and obnoxious man go into the liquor store. Then he noticed that he walked out and walked in the opposite direction, but then turned and saw the detective and came over. It just took a little more yelling at the detective for him to abandon his watching. A real police detective would have sent at least two men over in that area to watch.

Later, Anna and Joy go outside again and don't return, which causes immediate panic for the Dovers and Birches. At the same time, Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) is eating alone at a Chinese restaurant when he gets a call about a suspicious RV at a nearby rest stop. Loki takes the call and other cops show up. The driver of the RV is Alex Jones (Paul Dano) and he is immediately a suspect in kidnapping Anna and Joy. Loki does not play around when interrogating Alex as he thinks Alex is guilty. However, the RV is clean in the sense that there is no evidence to arrest Alex. Alex is let go, and Keller is not happy about this as he also strongly believes Alex to be guilty. Keller does everything he can to track down the girls. Grace is worried sick for her girl, literally. The Birches are also very worried. Loki must do everything in his power to track the girls' kidnapper and safely have them returned home before its too late.Denis Villenueve does an excellent job with handling this dramatic and chilling material. He created some powerful and emotional scenes with the shot lists he has put together. Villenueve has does a nice job at keeping the story moving forward while making this very emotional for the audience. Aaron Guzikowski wrote the screenplay here, and does a nice job of writing a dark, gritty, chilling script. Guzikowski does a nice job at making some plot twists I was not expecting. The only fault I point out on Denis Villenueve and Aaron Guzikowski is the ending is iffy, but the film overall is very well done thanks to the director and writer.Jake Gyllenhaal gives a very powerful performance as Detective Loki. He does a great job at showing a man who cares about the job at hand and will do anything to solve this case and have the girls safely returned home. Loki is a hard worker and Gyllenhall gives the best performance of his career. Hugh Jackman also does great work as Keller Dover. With this role, Jackman is very raw and emotional as a religious man and loving father who will also stop at nothing until his daughter is home safe and sound. Jackman gives one of the best performances in his career in this film.Of the supporting cast, Maria Bello is the standout as the worried, sick mother literally. Despite having limited screen time, Bello makes the most of her role as she is told by her husband to stay home and get better. She is even suspicious when some unusual activity happens in her house that makes her wonder if it's Anna. Terrence Howard and Viola Davis do some nice and emotional work here as the Birches. Howard has a bit more to do than Davis, but does great job at acting with his facial expressions. A surprising performance to me was Melissa Leo as Alex Jones's aunt. She is great at playing like nothing's wrong, despite her nephew being highly accused of being a kidnapper. Paul Dano even does a surprising job as the guy suspected of kidnapping and is good at playing the dumb guy who doesn't know what anyone is talking about.From a technical aspect, the best is the camera work by DP Roger Deakins. Deakins really is the best DP out there and knows very well how to get the shots his directors want and his brilliant use of lighting. I also quite enjoyed the editing by longtime Clint Eastwood collaborators Joel Cox and Gary Roach. I even thought the production design by Patrice Vermette.",

Gripping crime drama centered on a dual child abduction with both the law and family flummoxed to the point of extremes in finding the truth and justice (and the blind spots along the way) as the clock ticks to an inevitable climax of the point of no return. Excellent cast and a pinpricking screenplay by Aaron Guzikowski galvanized what could've been a run-of-the-mill vengeance melodrama thanks largely to shrewd and unnerving direction by Denis Villeneuve who generously takes his time in allowing enough rope for his audience to either hang onto (or hang themselves) from the utmost horror - the unknown. Jackman and Gyllenhaal give career performances as one of the aggrieved fathers and the insularly dogged police detective who share the common bond: the truth.",

One of those movies that I wonder why I'm watching because it makes me so uncomfortable. I'm glad I stuck with this though because it also ended up also being one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.A bit of a slow burn, heavy on the dialogue and maybe too long but masterful storytelling that never went where I was expecting, with many moments when the dots connected and I was like oh wow that's what the significance of \"that\" is or he has \"that\" to make noise with. Multiple red herrings in the suspect arena too.The acting here is also just fantastic, Oscar worthy performances from Hugh Jackman as he takes matters into his own hands when his daughter and her friend go missing; I have never seen him in a role like this before angry, possessed driven to the point of crazy decisions. Jake Gyllenhaal is also amazing as the detective assigned to the case and Melissa Leo, I didn't even recognize her. Can't go wrong with Terrence Howard or Viola Davis either who play the parents of the other missing girl.Also nice to see a movie (these days) that doesn't rely on special effects, superheroes or crazy action sequences to tell its story.

            "review_title": "VIEWS ON FILM review of Prisoners",
            "content": "Produced by busy bee actor Mark Wahlberg and helmed by acclaimed Canadian director Denis Villeneuve, Prisoners is the type of vehicle that is perfect for fall movie going season. It was filmed in Georgia (which I believe, was made to look like a drab part of Pennsylvania), takes place during Thanksgiving, and harbors a non-stop sense of doom and gloom from its opening frame (I think the sun shined maybe once during the entire 2 and a half hour running time). Listen, I'm not going to sugarcoat it for you, this picture is long, feels long, and it really takes its time. Villeneuve uses old school filming techniques and doesn't project anything flashy at all. The story, when it's all said and done however, is somewhat conventional. Therefore, I think it was necessary for the events to be drawn out and dragged through the muck a little. Based on an initial viewing, I realized that Prisoners would have felt like a TV movie and/or a Law and Order episode if the running time was trimmed to say, an hour and a half. Thankfully, it comes off as an extended director's cut (I'm not the only critic that felt this way) and that to a fault, is what makes the flick work. Watching it, I was reminded of a David Fincher film (without Fincher's signature style though) and not just because it starred staggeringly disciplined actor Jake Gyllenhaal. Prisoners is basically a mild spawn of Fincher's Se7en and Zodiac. It's not quite as effectively creepy as those films, but it's definitely good enough to recommend. Part kidnapping movie, part police detective character study, and part fatherly vigilante escapade, Prisoners tells the story of two families (neighbors from across the street) who get together on Thanksgiving day. The Birch's (Franklin Birch played by Terrence Howard and Nancy Birch played by Viola Davis who barely registers here) and the Dover's (Hugh Jackman and Maria Bello as Keller and Grace Dover) have a relaxing, calming holiday until their respective daughters wander off and go missing. This then gets the attention of a socially inept area detective (Mr. Loki played with vigor by Jake Gyllenhaal) who garners almost complete control over handling the missing person's case. As days go by and a potential suspect who might've taken the children gets bounced free, Jackman's angry, frustrated character eventually decides to take the law into his own hands. As the film slowly creeps toward its conclusion, you get small twists and turns (as well as slightly minimal character revelations). You also get to see how important drawing mazes are when it comes to character motivation (I've seen all kinds of thrillers and this plot point was a first for me). On the acting front, one thing to notice when viewing Prisoners, is how it pushes aside the other performers in the main cast (Oscar nominees like Viola Davis and Terrence Howard) and puts its main focus on Jackman. Now I'm not saying that Hugh Jackman is a mediocre actor. I just don't think he has the fiery chops to take on such a serious, dramatic role. His fault lies in the extreme overacting and preening to the audience. He seems to be saying, \"hey look at me, I should be nominated for an Oscar!\" With all the focus on him, the other player's roles become seriously underdeveloped. It gets to the point where you hardly see them anymore. Using little of no background music, there are a lot of carefully set up scenes in Prisoners. To a fault, Jackman appears in almost all of them. Jake Gyllenhaal (Detective Loki), the only other actor receiving top billing, takes up almost as much of the shared time. The difference with Gyllenhaal is that he quietly out acts his co-star. His minutes on screen are underplayed but they feel more genuine, more studied (Gyllenhaal's character's facial ticks like eye blinking were a nice touch), and generally more effective. He seems born to play his role. Jackman on the other hand, has one persuasive agent (he probably needs to stick to his strengths which are the X-Men movies). As a fall release that feels as if it's a journey or a metaphoric expedition, Prisoners has a teaser of an ending that may leave viewers holding their hands in the air. The over length may also be a factor when it comes to their varied attention spans. I however, found this exercise mildly absorbing and it was able to keep me interested. You may find the opening ten minutes a little muddled and weak in terms of set up, but after that, this exercise will place you in its grip (not too tightly) and not let go. Like I said earlier, Prisoners makes its case for being serviceable because it rides the wave of other crime dramas filling the screen with gloomy, overcast, and rain-drenched sequences. While watching it, you can almost sense that it does hold back just a little. This film doesn't take too many risks and it may not haunt you like it should (Villeneuve's direction is overly careful). But hey, it still gets by though mainly because of said look and Gyllenhaal's icy magnitude. All in all, if you like crime thrillers that take their time and don't try to jerk you around with the camera, Prisoners might just set you \"free.\"",

(BTW- the ending elicited many gasps, muttering and even consternation from the crowd I saw it with.) The performances really are superbly intense, believable and even award worthy. There are a few scenes where you really feel emotional pain ooze from the screen. Maria Bello, Viola Davis, Terrence Howard and especially Hugh Jackman each give us at least one scene that breaks the heart. It's powerful, intense acting at its most emotional peak.

            "content": "Prisoners stars Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal and a lot of other amazingly talented actors, it is directed by Dennis Villeneuve and it's an incredible nail-biting thriller, and probably one of the best film of 2013. Too bad it didn't get recognized as much as it deserved.The film starts at a Thanksgiving dinner between friends Keller Dover(spectacularly portrayed by Hugh Jackman) and Franklin Birch (Terrence Howard, great job as well) and their respective families. They each have 2 children, the youngest of which are mysteriously kidnapped when they go play outside. Both families call the authorities of course and desperately search for their children, Keller's older son mentions an RV who was parked in the street the first time the kids went to play. The police find the man, who is Alex Jones(Paul Dano), a person with the mentality of a 10-year-old. He is interrogated by Detective Loki (brilliant Jake Gyllenhaal is brilliant) who begins to think he had nothing to do with the abduction. Keller on the other hand is sure that Alex knows where the kids are, and decides to take matters in his own hands, and ends up doing lots of illegal, horrible and cruel things. The acting in the movie is perfect, no one in the entire movie portrays their character badly, they were really all amazing, with extra extra props to Hugh Jackman, who gives a phenomenal performance, the best I've ever seen from him, he starts off as a good man, but when his daughter is kidnapped he just loses it and descends into darkness so to speak. An ironic thing in the movie (it's on purpose of course) is that he is a very religious man, and when the credits roll he has committed so many sins it's mind-blowing that a guy could go so far, even with the good reason behind his actions. There are some scenes that Jackman just flips his s***, and it's so damn realistic! Oscar worthy is an understatement. Jake Gyllenhaal is incredible in the movie as well, I mean this guy is always brilliant, come on, he also feels so real in the movie, you feel his frustration due to not being able to find the kids, he is pretty much what I expect a real detective to be like and he's the only moral character in the movie. The supporting cast is also great, Maria Bello, Terrence Howard, especially Paul Dano, he was incredible.The story is very smart, it's pretty much a puzzle, you don't know what is the truth, you can only speculate using what you were given, it deals with heavy subjects though, so it is not for the faint of heart at all. The director managed to create a incredible dread- filled atmosphere, using the heavy rain and the icy winter, it all contributes to creating the sinister mood of the film, top-notch directing and cinematography. The suspense just keeps piling up until the finale, which is one of the best endings I've seen. The film's question is \"how far are you willing to go in order to save your child?\", and that's what Dover is doing, and holy nuts does he go far. He does have a good reason, it's true of course, but he ends up doing things that are too unjustifiable, even with the events that drove him to do them. And that makes for a great picture.Prisoners is a very intense film, I found it pretty hard to watch, especially in the heavy scenes, if you're easily shaken, don't watch this film, it's incredible, but it's the kind of film that's despite being great, you don't want to watch again, I mean I was cringing a bit with clenched fists while I watched it, on the edge of my seat of course. It is very intriguing and smart, if you can stomach it, I recommend this movie for sure, it is flawless.",

There is much to gain from sequels. However this keeps you wanting more, it tells an incredible story, and it keeps you on the edge of your seat.

The image of desperate parents on the TV clinging to the hope that their missing child is still alive is something we have all seen at some point in our lives.Prisoners revolves around two working class families who are presented with the unthinkable reality that their children have gone missing only yards from their home.Hugh Jackman plays the central character of the protective father Keller Dover, desperate to find answers to the whereabouts of his missing daughter. He is joined by a second father of a missing child, played by Terence Howard.The story wastes little time in kick starting events with the girls disappearing after leaving the home without consulting their elders.A mysterious camper van parked merely yards from the family home at the time of the abduction results in the driver Alex, played by Paul Dano being branded the key suspect in the case.Here we are introduced to local Detective Loki played by Jake Gyllenhaal, a rough and ready, tattooed loner with a history of solving missing children cases.When Alex is brought in for questioning, the police are unable to obtain any information from the mute suspect or have enough evidence to make a conviction.Infuriated by this, Dover embarks on a dark and brutal mission to force Alex to confess to the whereabouts of their missing daughters.Prisoners is a riveting atmospheric thriller that pulls no punches in its depiction of what is without doubt one of the most unforgivable crimes that can be committed.Stylishly directed by director Denis Villeneuve and with Roger Deakins on top form with some gorgeous cinematography results in a film drenched in dread from the first frame to the last.Hugh Jackman delivers without doubt the performance of his career. The sheer weight of his need to find his daughter is etched on his face throughout. His time playing Wolverine has served him well with bursts of violence both physical and verbal as he grows more and more frustrated with the search.Gyllenhaal also delivers one his finest performances in a long time. He has the look of a man who has been to some very dark places, the former missing children cases having visibly taken their toll.Comparisons have been made to the brilliant Zodiac and like that film Prisoners takes its time, refusing to be rushed and avoiding clich\u00e9.As the credits rolled I felt exhausted like the characters up on the screen but also confident enough to shout from the roof tops that I had just seen one of the best thrillers in a long time.",

I love the start of the movie and the taking as well as how it was hinted at. They did that so well and built it to such a great degree. The use of the rain when they went out to try and find them also really heightened the situation. The whole tale did drag on quite a long way, but I cannot say I was bored at any point. Yes, there were some loose ends which I didn't quite get as the movie went on in terms off several things that didn't really add much substance to the plot and a few things that in my opinion were a bit confusing, nonetheless, the role of the sub plots and the smaller characters was once more done well and each of them really fitted the type of play they were in. The ending to the movie really opens up the chance on more of this but to be honest, I don't see where they can go. Probably would have score 7.75 for me but will round that to 8.",

These questions are answered and answered well from the first moment they notice the 2 girls are missing.Like in most movies, there is an obvious suspect and as the audience you follow along because really, how the movie is playing out, you start to believe it. The suspect is played by Paul Dano. Who does a brilliant job and you really don't know what his deal is. In my mind, I couldn't read him.At a running time of almost 150 minutes, you don't feel like you've been watching a movie for so long, which is a very good sign of a movie you will enjoy.

Jackman's acting was definitely a career best, even better than Logan, and he conferred every emotion so well I couldn't help but cry and almost pray alongside him. Moreover, Gyllenhaal once again proves the extreme diversity of his acting and delivers a brilliant performance which also places among his best.I'm not underestimating when I say that this movie is extremely brutal, sometimes maybe even a bit too brutal. Not only in its graphicness, but in what it implies about the characters and their actions as well as the feelings of guilt and anxiety certain scenes make you feel. This is very effectful and moody, but I can't help but wish that certain sequences were toned down, as I believe it would be more enjoyable that way. In contrast to this, the sound editing and score is stellar and really accentuates all the feelings I had throughout the film.The story is gripping and has a nice balance between incredibly intense scenes and calmer ones where you get to breathe, but it's never lighthearthed and thus a little too harsh and depressing at times. The third act of the movie is weaker than the rest and leaves you with more questions than answers in typical Villenueve fashion. While well executed and interesting, it doesn't give me all the answers I'm after and responds to the rest of them in not so satisfying ways. Having said this, the final scene of the film is absolutely wonderful and almost manages to make up for the issues.In summary, \"prisoners\" is a dark and truly horrifying thriller that serves you intriguing mysteries in typical Villeneueve manner but dissapoints when it comes to answering them. Safe to say, I will be sleeping with light on tonight.",

Ranging from story line to acting, you can't find a dull moment in this film to sit down and say \"I'm actually not enjoying myself\". This movie will keep you at the edge of your seat through it's 2-hour length and you will began to actually use your brain to follow the case along with Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) to find the two lost daughters. Going into this movie, I honestly didn't think I would like it. The previews looked suspenseful and I wanted to see a nice crime movie that I had never seen before, but once the credits started rolling I really had to sit back in my seat and think about what a mind-blowing experience it all is. This movie will keep you up at night just thinking about it, whether it gives you the creeps or a quick laugh over something that happened, this movie really impacts your life when you sit down and watch it in that dark room with your friends, family, or even by yourself. This is a dark movie, not one where you feel for the bad guy or where the good guy gets taken and you hear the life story of the villain, this movie shows just what happens out there when you have no idea what is going on. Humans will do whatever they have to just to find what has happened to whatever you are looking for (objects to people) and this movie shows just what a father would go through for his daughter. Of course, it doesn't show you how to cope with the loss of a loved one, but it does show you a lot of dad's points of view when they think about what they would go through to get their son/daughter back. Hugh Jackman shows this really well throughout the movie by showing us just how angry he can get. I would recommend this to everyone that likes the actors or likes a good story line and I hope you guys can see this first hand in the the theaters for yourself.",

            "content": "While \"Prisoners\" has won acclaim for its style, the film's content is both unpleasant and stretches credibility beyond the pale.Hugh Jackman as Keller Dover and Jake Gyllenhaal as Detective Loki are both excellent in the leading roles, and director Denis Villeneuve evokes plenty of suspense in his lighting, camera angles, and pacing. But as the film unfolds, the story of the abduction of two children becomes more and more depressing.One of the problems with the film was the extremely unappealing characters. Jackman's role goes well beyond that of the concerned parent, as he breaks the law by kidnapping and torturing the young man whom he believes is the perpetrator. Gyllenhaal's detective is also concerned; but he is also inept and becomes so out of control emotionally that he attacks another suspect while in police custody, turning the prime suspect into another victim when he commits suicide.The convoluted kidnapping plot is never completely unraveled in the film. SPOILER ALERT FOLLOWS: As the film moves towards its climax, one of the little girls who has escaped her captors, implicates Jackman's character as one of the kidnappers who had placed tape over the mouths of the victims. The family of Keller Dover owned the residence where an earlier kidnapping the murder had occurred. It is that residence where Keller Dover takes Alex Jones (Paul Dano) to be tortured. So, the clear implication is that the devoted father was somehow involved in the original kidnapping plot.While worthy of discussion and admirable for the good performances, \"Prisoners\" seems incomplete as a film, the final cut no more than a work in progress.",

I was intrigued by this film right from the opening scene, it definitely had an atmosphere about it, and this was maintained throughout the movie. I'm not a director, and I doubt that any critic could accurately explain the sheer talent and creative processes that go on behind the scenes, to direct a movie like this, so I wouldn't even attempt try and describe the tools he used to manipulate the audience, but i found myself questioning and guessing the whole time, was a great ride.As I said, up there with one of the best suspense/thriller films I've ever seen.",

Excellent performances, beautiful cinematography and a haunting soundtrack combine to create one of the best films this year. The story is about two girls who are abducted, and the ensuing investigation. One of the parents (played by Hugh Jackman) is not satisfied with how the police are doing their job, and takes it upon himself to do some investigating of his own. What follows is a journey into the abyss and dark recesses of the human soul as the rules are bent (and broken) in an attempt to solve the mystery and find closure. I don't want to give anything else away, as that would severely reduce the emotional impact. This movie does what most can't, and maintains an almost unbearable level of tension throughout it's entire run time, which is about two and a half hours. Everyone of the leads is on their A-game, and bring such pathos to their characters that you can't help but identify and sympathize with them. Of course, who couldn't given the subject matter (unless you're a psychopath)? This is greatly enhanced by a lurking sense of dread conveyed brilliantly by the cinematography (courtesy of Roger Deakins, and deserving of an Oscar) and a haunting score. You just can't take your eyes off of the screen, and you'll never want to check your watch, it's that good. Overall, this is one of the best movies I've seen all year and I highly recommend you check it out...without kids present, preferably.",

One cloudy Thanksgiving Day, the children thought it was fun to beat up a van with their fists while one of them attempted to stab the van with her newborn claws. Eventually, she doesn't have full access to it, resulting in both of them being kidnapped while the son and the neighbor's daughter is just watching the latest episode of Bachelor's Paradise. They decided to do a fun Easter egg hunt, and no one got an Easter egg at all so Wolverine loses it. Donnie Darko goes into a Chinese restaurant and wonders if he was born in the year of the rabbit. Finds out he wasn't. Then he hears that there's a van that looks like Burger King themed van. He finds out that there was the van right behind him, trying to kill a tree. They founded the man and they revealed that it was Eli Sunday, escaping his death from Plainview's hands. They find out that Plainview still bashed his head in but he's still in perfect shape. Wolverine loses it and decides to go medieval torture on him. And the rest is just Wolverine torturing Eli Sunday for not getting killed in There Will Be Blood while Donnie Darko predicts that there is going to be another end of the world soon that year.My Thoughts: I thought it was shocking when I first watched this. You see cute-faced Eli turn into a big peach emoji with a dark red color from the color editors of the movie, \"The Hero of Color City\". This film goes off with oh hey, the children are kidnapped. And then when you hear Wolverine shout, you just jump off your seat and you're like, \"Oh don't go mess around with me like that Wolverine.\" *shouts* \"Shoot, gotta run away from here.\" This film is a crime thriller epic that lasts for 153 minutes of nonstop pain and suffering of the Behind the Scenes of the Greatest Showman.\nDon't watch this if you're a weak stomach. But if you're not, then watch it. The film is by far the scariest thriller I've seen. This movie is intense and emotionally disturbing to see Grandma from Grandma Got Ran Over By A Reindeer pointing a gun at Wolverine because Wolverine doesn't use his powers at all so it sounds stupid yet scary to see Grandma pointing the gun at Wolverine after Christmas. (I forgot to tell you that Prisoners is a extended cut of Grandma Got Ran Over By A Reindeer)\nJust watch it if you are able to hand brutal violence and if you like long crime thriller epics.",

His first three, August 32nd on Earth, Maelstr\u00f6m, and Polytechnique, weren't very good for me, and only until his 4th, Incendies, which I pretty recently watched, did Villeneuve got the right budget to make great movies.I watched Prisoners a while ago, and I remembered not really digging it. However, after this rewatch, I totally loved this movie. First of all, Hugh Jackman's intense performance outshined everyone else. The way his character lost his humanity while trying to find the answer was both heartbreaking and terrifying. Jake Gyllenhaal was also great with his change in demeanor as a cop. The way he smiled at first and then turned violent got on my nerve a little bit.The story itself was intense, slow, yet intriguing. For 2 hours and 30 minutes, I did not feel bored, and only got more gripped into the story as the movie progressed. It did not feel long. The plot was a harsh look at the way people lost their faith or tried to cling to their faith without losing themselves to hatred.Probably the best aspect that elevated the mystery was the maze symbol that became more apparent toward the end. Not only was it integral to the plot, but the mazes without a way out also served as prisons that the characters got stuck in. Some got imprisoned in captivity, childhood trauma, revenge, finding answers, and hatred of God.Overall, an amazing and gripping thriller that I wanted more of. 9/10.",

            "content": "I really didn't like this movie. Not because of the gore, not because of the language, but because of the pacing, the acting and most definitely the ending. The movie went on for two hours and they left it hanging at a really stupid time - if you're going to purposely leave the ending hanging, leave it at a time point where it's a bit ambiguous and up to the viewer how it ends. But they left it hanging at a point where it's pretty obvious what's going to happen next, but denying the viewers the chance to see the story wrap up (why????)The pacing was terrible. You hardly got a chance to feel and know the characters before things were happening. You felt no sympathy for the girls, who you saw for maybe a few minutes before they got abducted. You didn't share the mum's grief because her acting was so obviously forced. The guy who gets tortured and beaten was (surprise surprise) completely innocent, which was obvious right from the start. The dad is only ever shown stony-faced or blowing his tits in a rage, except for towards the end when his guilt over bashing up a guy who's clearly innocent makes him get stressed and say a few lines of prayer, and then torture the kid some more. And at the end when he finds out the culprit is the kid's aunt, he doesn't even show a single bit of remorse over the horrible thing he's done. Also, the aunt: really? Urgh, so obvious. So tired of the same old formula in every thriller movie: killer turns out to be the one you least expect, someone you were introduced to at the start of the movie, and the crazy story behind them being the unlikeliest killer in the world is revealed only at the end. Halfway through the movie I used that formula to deduce the only person who fit it was the aunt, and prayed to God that this movie wouldn't follow the same boring clich\u00e9. But it did, even though they ended up adding a possible suspect later whose storyline they didn't bother to explain and whose purpose was simply to try and lead us off the right trail when they brought out the 'it's the aunt' card right at the end. What was with that guy? Why was he obsessed with pouring pig's blood on kids' clothes? Nobody cares, apparently.Movie makers - if you're going to make the main character some sort of antihero who's morally ambiguous, who does awful things out of desperation, who thinks they're doing the wrong thing for the right reasons, actually put in some effort making us CONNECT with this character. Show us his human side, show him feeling guilt and remorse, show him with his head in his hands saying 'what have I done?', show him feeling worried as hell about his daughter, show him co-operating with the police because he realises that's his best chance of getting his daughter back. Give us a better reason for him taking the law into his own hands than just him thinking he's better than the police at judging who's a criminal and who's not. Show him TRYING to act like a decent human being before succumbing to his emotions and going ballistic. Show him doubting whether what he's doing is really right at all. Show that good side as well as the bad. REALLY show it, because the few moments he showed a sliver of distress, he seemed more angry/upset that the kid wasn't talking than that he may be doing something awful. Because this whole movie I was almost hoping his daughter would die just to serve him right. I felt more hatred towards the father who was alternating between praying to God and torturing a mentally disabled kid than the woman who abducted his child. Epic fail.",

Gyllenhall, continuing from End of Watch, plays the clich\u00e9d part of the super smart Detective, (who has solved every case he's been on....duh), and throws in some great improvisation, which makes the part more likable. Jackman as the troubled father is near perfect, in perhaps one of his finest performance.As is typical of any Hollywood thriller, there are quite a few psychos on the prowl, some over the top scenarios and of course unreal backgrounds that pop out of nowhere.Watch it to enjoy a great acting fest, but not for a great thriller.",

            "content": "Prisoners is a terrific maze of a thriller as the viewer is never quite sure of what's about to happen. Jake Gyllenhaal plays Detective Loki who has solved every case he's had. And this one is not to elude him but amazingly, he's hot and cold, off and on, and only solves the case with a bit of luck. Hugh Jackman plays Keller Dover, a man who will almost stop at nothing to find his daughter. His and Franklin Birch (played by Terrence Howard) are fathers caught between desperation and loss of ethics. As vigilantes, they take twisted justice into their own hands. As one amateur reviewer here suggests, it is an unusual thriller clouded by moral ambiguity. However, I'm not sure if that is really the case, but rather how far are we willing to test morality and ethics.Acting is excellent by all major characters including Viola Davis who plays a distraught Nancy Birch, Maria Bello who plays Grace Dover, Melissa Leo who is excellent as Holly Jones, and Paul Dano who plays Alex Jones. Cinematography by Roger Deakins and direction by Denis Villeneuve is outstanding. Kudos to Roger who was nominated for an Oscar and this is as good as his cinematography in No Country For Old Men.Amazingly, Prisoners only received one Oscar nomination. But then many great films were snubbed by the Oscars. For example, Citizen Kane often rated #1 on many critics list only won one Oscar. Taxi Driver went 0 for 4 in wins and nominations, and Once Upon a Time in the West never received any nominations but among most critics, these films are among the best.Looking up some lists as for the best films of 2013, for example, the Huffington Post lists 17 films topped by 2) Gravity and 1) American Hustle. Gravity is a spectacular visual film with a poor script, average acting and weak plot as it defies every realistic scenario in space. It will fall into the Rocky category, a film honored by a clueless academy that should beg forgiveness. American Hustle is superior to Gravity but dries up a but at the end. I would place Prisoners at the same level, and perhaps even better than American Hustle. It is probably the best thriller since Silence of the Lambs and a remarkable insightful film into human ethics. Unfortunately, despite being in that category, it happened to be made in 2013 which, frankly, appears to be one of the strongest cluster of films, although, I would think many 9s but perhaps no legendary 10s.However, only a few graphic thrillers such as Silence of the Lambs or No Country for Old Men have ever been recognized. One wonders if being too graphic turned off Oscar nominations. Hollywood would rather have a clean sentimental screening, like Gravity or 12 Years A Slave. But as time goes on, this film should rise as a classic.",

            "content": "I remember when Prisoners came out right near the end of my summer vacation. My mom and I wanted to see a movie and the choices were between it and Blue Jasmine. The 153 minute runtime was a bit daunting for us, so we went for the latter. Meanwhile, this movie did pretty well at the box-office and got rave reviews, which is odd considering I vaguely recall any sort of marketing campaign. It came out on DVD and it still passed under my radar. So now that I finally watched it, I realized: this is by far one of the best movies of 2013.I mean where do I begin? I sincerely regret not seeing this in theaters when I had the chance. Hugh Jackman plays Keller Dover, a devoutly religious man who married to Grace, played by Maria Bello. They have two kids, Ralph and Anna, and one Thanksgiving Day, they go to their friends the Birch's for dinner. Nancy and Franklin Birch, played by Viola Davis and Terrance Howard respectively, have two kids right around the same ages as the Dover's, named Eliza and Joy. Anna and Joy, the two youngest girls, suddenly disappear after leaving the house that afternoon. All suspicions point to an RV driven by Alex Jones, played exceptionally by Paul Dano, but when no hard evidence is found, he is set loose. Keller is convinced that Jones took the girls, and resorts to extreme measures in order to find out the truth. He kidnaps Jones and locks him in an apartment and proceeds to torture him over several days.On the law enforcement side of things, Detective Loki, played by Jake Gyllenhaal, spearheads the investigation chasing down leads and trying to find a new suspect. Tensions become elevated between him and Keller after no new suspects have been found, and Loki begins to gain suspicions about Keller, which leads him to follow him rather than looking for new clues. What follows is a finely crafted tale of loss and what we find ourselves capable of doing when we lose the ones we love.Jackman gives a phenomenal performance of a man driven to the edge of his beliefs, a man who will stop at nothing in order to find his daughter. Just like he questions his faith and morals, we too do not know how we are supposed to feel about his method of extracting information. He is so convinced that Jones took his daughter that we as the audience support him. But when he begins to torture Jones, we are left to question our ethics behind his choices. It is a tough moral issue. It is a true shame that Jackman got so little recognition for his performance. His transformation throughout the film is heartbreaking, and we see it all happen, with Jackman going all out delivering what is one of the best performances of his career. His wife however, completely shuts down and is utterly ignorant to the activities of her husband, who is constantly trying to protect and reassure her that everything is going to be alright while she descends into depression.Gyllenhaal too does a great job in his role. He is rough around the edges; giving us the feeling that he can't entirely be trusted (at least that was the case for me). But the scenes involving him and Jackman are some of the best in the film. The problem is we see Loki as a hindrance to Keller; he is constantly snooping around on him, we feel as though he is more harm than good to solving the case, and even though he is trying his hardest to find the girls, it appears that Keller is more likely to get information despite his morally questionable actions.What makes this movie so compelling is its utterly intense atmosphere. There are so many different layers of tension; whether it is between Keller and Loki, which consistently rises throughout the film, or between Keller and Franklin, and eventually himself, as they both begin to wonder if torturing Jones will really lead somewhere.Along with Jackman, Gyllenhaal, Dano, who all should have been praised during the award season, Melissa Leo, Howard, and Davis all give great performances. Leo plays the aunt of Jones, who has the greatest faith in her son, and is certain he didn't do anything.But I will not ruin any of the major plot points, because this movie continually surprised me with how well written and mysterious it is. I will say that the movie is a tad too long, and that might scare people off. It is also very intense and not for people looking for a casual kidnapping mystery movie. The plot could drag for some, but for me I was completely into it the whole time. The only little qualms I had were the underwriting of the other children of the Birch's and Dover's. They are pretty nonexistent for most of the movie and they could have been featured more in a way to show the stress on them as well as their parents.I sit here writing this and still find it unfathomable how this movie only got a Best Cinematography nod. Jackman was a tour-de-force, and definitely deserved some recognition. Heck, the writing could have gotten a Best Original Screenplay nomination over Blue Jasmine or Nebraska. But one nomination for this entire movie blows my mind. I will not let another movie like this slip underneath my radar. This movie could probably be considered the most underrated of 2013.So, if you want to watch a movie that will keep you guessing, that has fantastic performances, and that palpably intense, check Prisoners out. It is a little late now, but if I were to redo my Top of 2013 list, I would most definitely add this on there. Go watch this movie.Ragingfilm.com",

It's so potently riveting that I couldn't turn away from it until the first ending credit. I can't praise this film enough and I feel that it deserves to have the honor of being discussed as a potential awards contender starting with both Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal, who give what is perhaps the best performances of their careers as their character-driven roles as the two leads were raw, real and makes you start questioning about what would you do if you were ever put in the exact same position either character's shoes were in.",

Prisoners follows the investigation into the disappearance of a pair of young girls Anna and Joy from outside their homes. The main focus of the film is the father of Anna, Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) who is not happy with the urgency of the police investigation being led by Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal).The premise of the film is quite interesting as the parents are obviously desperate to find the children as quickly as possible. They see the police investigation to be very slow and find it extremely frustrating. I couldn't help but think the film could have been better. The film feels like it's been edited to suit the mass market whereas it should have stuck to it's indie roots. That may be the problem with getting big name stars as the money that is handed out to the cast needs to be recouped via the box office.",

            "review_title": "Great story, but many flaws",
            "content": "Prisoners was a gritty and engaging, child kidnap film that got our attention early and kept it until the end. However, it had many needless quirks and meaningless distractions and misdirections that it was difficult at times to follow what was necessary to the story and what was not. The highlight of the film was Hugh Jackman's character Keller, the stressed-out and angry father of one of two kidnapped little girls in Conyers, Georgia. This father's anger over losing his little girl drove the story and gave it its powerful energy that had all eyeballs glued to the screen throughout, which is the true +mark of a successful suspense story.Bad weather prevailed in this gloomy story that was so full of uncaring, devious and sick human behavior that it almost made you ashamed to be one of the same species. The entire cast did a very effective job, Maria Bello as Keller's depressive wife, Paul Dano as the uber-creepy suspect nearly tortured to death, Melissa Leo as his psychopathic aunt/mother(?), Terrence Howard as a soft and sensitive black man and neighbor whose child was also taken, and Viola Davis as his so sad, grieving wife. Jake Gyllenhaal was Loki, the also sad but serious and dedicated case detective whose outward bland calm was belied by an eye-blinking facial tick that well showed the giant stress he was constantly under to solve the case for his incompetent and pushy, but very antagonistic and unhelpful, captain.As the story has been detailed by others, my concern was for the details in the telling of the story. The first half of the film was terrific and built the story effectively and emotionally, but the second half had so many unnecessary twists and incomplete explanations of what really happened that it left me with a feeling of \"that could have been done much better\".I had the case figured out much faster than Loki did, as he missed the main clue from an earlier murder that would have solved the case if he were a better and \"more observant\" detective(isn't that their job?). That he missed it was the main flaw in the story to me, but I was also irked at the case conclusion that was merely flashed too-briefly in newspaper headlines. That part left me with.....\"That's it?\" IMO, it was a too-quick and unsatisfying resolution to the long and harrowing, two and a half hour film story. However, the cut-off ending of the film that others have complained about was very impactful even if what led to it was tipped off earlier, thus very predictable.All in all, great acting in a flawed but very interesting and foreboding film story made my rating of it a strong 7. Warning... bloody human torture scenes and violent psychopathic behavior.",

And, while I do like Hugh Jackman (and I do think he's a great actor), he's never been one of my favourites. That being said, I did enjoy Prisoners\u0085a lot. The movie was gritty, intense and emotionally involved. Jake has definitely found his niche with the law-enforcement-themed films. Prisoners is about child abductions and the effects it has on the families involved and those who take on the case. It is a realistic approach on that matter (much like Jake's other film, End of Watch). You have two families ((Dovers' (father played by Hugh Jackman) and the Birches (father played by Terrance Howard))) getting together for Thanksgiving, when things take a turn for the worse when their youngest children get abducted. Then you have the investigator (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) who isn't really a rookie for investigations, but a rookie when it comes to dealing with child abduction cases. And it takes its toll on him. He gets emotionally invested, which is something they (investigators) try their hardest not to do. (SPOILERS START)Then you have Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) who ends up abducting the person they think is responsible, Alex Jones (Paul Dano). He ends up torturing him, trying to get information from him, despite Alex being mentally handicapped. Franklin Birch (Terrance Howard) steps in and, while he thinks it's morally wrong, is so desperate to find his daughter, he goes along with it. He does fight between what is right and wrong and even tells his wife (Viola Davis) about it, but she's on Keller's side. Meanwhile, Detective Loki (Gyllenhaal) is losing it to the case. He's having breakdowns and is desperate to find the girls. (SPOILERS END)Honestly, I think this is some of the best performances by these actors. I never saw Terrance as a serious actor before this, but after this film, my opinion is changing. Hugh Jackman's always been able to do serious roles and he really is great in this - probably one of his best performances. Jake, however, while I do feel this is another amazing and in intense performance, nothing will ever top End of Watch for me. This is a runner-up, though. His performance is flawless and he does show the reality these types of cases has on investigators.(SPOILERS START)One thing I did joke about with my mum afterwards, though, was that End of Watch ended with Zavala (Michael Pena) dying and Taylor (Jake Gyllenhaal) being forced to live with his best friend and partner being dead. This felt somewhat like a continuation on that. Like Taylor decided to quit the LAPD, move to a smaller department, but keep going and train up to be an investigator, despite being without his partner. So things got to him easier. (SPOILERS END)This film is insanely amazing. It's real, it's dark, it's gritty and it's one you have to be emotionally prepared to handle. Even if you're not, still see it. It's a great movie with intense scenes and it's the most realistic performances from Hugh and Terrance that I'd never thought I'd see.",

The movie may be slow for people, but it takes its time to develop strong characters and creates a sense of realism from the performances. Hugh Jackman's character is so well done I was reminded of the desperate man performances of the past like James Stewart in Vertigo (1958) or Clint Eastwood in Unforgiven (1992). It's a very enduring character that I believe will be remembered fondly in the years to come. Another interesting performance is by Jake Gyllenhaal as Detective Loki. He's a Detective who cares about the case but is open to all possibilities as film goes on. Even his image with the slicked back hair and tattoos are rather different from the strong moral sense he exhibits. But aside from the performances the cinematography stands out. The director of photography, Roger Deakins, uses slow zooms and out focus backgrounds with great editing to create a unique visual experience. Visually it compares to Deakins' other work like Skyfall (2012) and No Country for Old Men (2007). In the end Prisoners work on multiple levels and is a great film to see in theatres.",

            "content": "Such a mess of a movie, started off well enough and it does hold your attention, but the plot has so many issues it's hard to know where to even start.Firstly what the f is wrong with the characters in this movie? The kidnapper does so much messed up stuff....then confesses to a priest? lol what? So then the priest kills him and doesn't tell anyone, and just leaves the body lying around in a secret room under the house? And the only thing between that body and exposure.....is a fridge.....lmaoooooNobody can talk in this movie, talking is forbidden, the guy Huge Jackman is torturing can't talk because????? Why would he not just tell him, the old lady has the girls!!!!! Like what is this writing?Then \"children's clothes\" man is intelligent when he escapes jake gyllenhaal, and seems normal enough when he's arrested, but then he turns into a whacko once he's in custody and WON'T TALK, whyyyyyyyy. Then Jake gylenhaal snaps and slams the guys face on the table LMAOOOOO IS THIS A MEME?The ending of the movie is so artificially set up...so cringe. Huge Jackman talks to the girl in the hospital, and sprints out super obviously......even though he supposedly wants to go alone, otherwise he would have told the cops \"hey my daughter is here, go save her. Instead he just goes alone, and walks into this woman's house, like the dumbest character in thriller history, and turns his back to this lady. The only way Huge Jackman could have stuffed up the situation worse, would be if he killed the black girl (Joy) as he left the hospital.\nThat way, Huge guarantees he and his daughter both die, and nobody will ever find the bodies!!!! But still credit where credit is due, I give Huge 7/10 for his suicide mission.I thought this was a great movie when I was 16, what 3 will do if you improve your mindset and appreciation for good films. I watched nightcrawler yesterday, I was expecting to like prisoners and hate nightcrawler, it's actually the other way around.",

Not much boring situations or pointless filming. The atmosphere is nice, kind of dark, calm, but still dense and threatening. It's quite unique. Not too much actors or subplots.7 is still the highest rate I can give. There's still too many problems in the movie. The whole kidnapping thing does not make sense. And the movie leave behind couple questions. First: What the heck was the point of that other suspect, who committed suicide? And what about his mazes? Other irksome thing was the ending. What about the Dover? You just can't end the movie like that. It makes the whole movie pointless. And very sad. It's just wrong that father does everything to save her daughter, and eventually girl survives, but he still never see her again. This really wasn't truly happy ending. Although it's good that there are movies which doesn't have clich\u00e9 ending. Still, it's quite sad.However, like I said, the movie itself was enjoyable to watch. Good acting and atmosphere. Interesting and deep. I really recommend to watch if you like detective stories.(PS. When I first saw the detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) I was wondering through the movie, where I have seen him before... Those corners of the mouth was so recognizable. And yes, he does EXCELLENT job in this movie! Very good actor. I couldn't remember it until now I watched the filmography after the movie.

            "review_title": "Full of suspense, emotions and drama! Best movie in 2013 to date.",
            "content": "Prisoners is a gritty, incredibly well-acted, suspenseful, thought- provoking crime drama thriller. Unlike Taken or Man On Fire, Prisoners is full of emotions as a family is put through its darkest hours. The suspense never lets up. Throughout the film you feel Dover's pain, anger and moral struggles as he deals with this situation. The director does a brilliant job keeping the audiences deep into the emotions of the family despite the fact that Dover himself kidnap Alex Jones, locks him up for days and brutally tortures him just to know the whereabouts of his daughter. This movie explores the issue of moral ambiguity, and it shows just how far desperation can change a loving father into a cruel, heartless person just to protect his own family. With his daughter's chance of survival diminishing each seconds, is Dover's action justified? That's a question for you to ponder.The two leads, Hugh Jackman and Jack Gyllenhaal give the career best performance in my opinion. Jackman tears into scenes in a way we've never seen him and layers his character with plenty of affection, empathy, grief, and rage. It's his best dramatic endeavor he's ever done. As Detective Loki, Gyllenhaal stands firm and tall in one of the year's finest performances. Terrifically executed as a man disconnected from real emotion, he finds himself enamored by the mystery surrounding two missing girls. But the most surprising performance comes from Paul Dano. His character, Alex Jones was mentally-challenged, and has an IQ of that 10-year-old kid. This is a difficult character to play, but Paul manages to make that character his own by his superb portrayal of Alex.The plot is a wonderful puzzle, unraveling slowly to reveal hidden layers of depth and complexity. At 153 minutes, the film is detailed, precise, and engaging nearly throughout. With a mix of top-notch cinematography, remarkably unsettling music, superb performances, and a thrilling/powerful story, Prisoners will definitely be one of this year's features that will surely be remembered.Final Verdict: 8.5/10. If you love films that explore more than just entertainment, such as important themes and moral ambiguity as a whole, you cannot go wrong with Prisoners. I would not recommend skipping out on Prisoners unless you're of the type that prefers more lighthearted and fun movies.",

But their child dies and these two decide to take revenge on Alam and Adam because of this! The couple planned to go to war with God by stealing the children and killing them so that the child's parents would lose patience and faith (just like what happened to Keller). So they started kidnapping children!But one day, Holly Jones' husband goes to the priest to confess; The priest kills him so that he will not continue doing this. So that body we saw in the basement of the pastor's house was actually Holly Jones' husband.Alex (the one who was tortured) and Bob (the one who committed suicide) were previously kidnapped by these two. Alex was actually the son of the same mother that Detective Loki spoke to. But Bob managed to escape.Now let's talk about Bob; The same mysterious person who did not know exactly what he did! Bob was kidnapped by an old woman and her husband and somehow escaped from them. But due to drinking a special medicine (the same liquid in the bottle), his memory was erased and he could not remember anything about the kidnappers and the identity of the kidnapper couple was not determined. But this kidnapping had a negative effect on his mind and made him crazy. Bob had actually done nothing! Only because of his mental problems he tried to simulate stealing the girls and he did it by stealing the children's clothes from their house. The sock that was found under the window of Claire's house, the night of the robbery, had fallen from Bob's hand. So Bob was completely innocent and innocent!The kidnapping couple gives the children a book of mazes to solve and if they manage to solve them all, they let them go. But one of the mazes was unsolvable! Bob had a special relationship with the labyrinth and the snake; Because during the stolen period, he was tortured by the labyrinth and the snake! In a part of the movie, we learn that Holly Jones' husband was very fond of snakes and probably used to scare children with snakes. The fear of snakes caused Alex to fall behind.When the girls go outside, they board Alex's caravan to play with him, but Holly Jones steals the girls away.In the end, the black girl managed to escape from the old woman's house, but Anna was trapped at the last moment and could not escape. At the hospital, the black girl said to Hugh Jackman: \"You were there!\" This made Hugh Jackman realize that the girls were at Holly Jones' house all this time and he is the kidnapper of our story!At the end of the movie, Detective Loki heard the sound of the whistle and Claire was definitely saved from death.",

Beginning with an almost unbearably tense opening hour or so, Prisoners soon dissolves into a formulaic thriller, abandoning the near-unbearable tension of the opening hour and packing the film with foot-chases and repetitive torture-porn, finding itself too caught up in tying all the many loose ends together for it all to make sense.Whilst attending a Thanksgiving dinner, the daughters of Keller (Hugh Jackman) and Grace Dover (Mario Bello), and their neighbours Franklin (Terrence Howard) and Nancy Birch (Viola Davis), go missing. The only clue is a mysterious RV parked outside moments before the abduction, which is quickly found by Detecive Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) in a car park with an apparently stricken Alex Jones (Paul Dano) inside. After Alex is quickly released due to a lack of evidence, Keller is furious and unconvinced, abducting him and taking him to an abandoned former home in order to instigate his own method of interrogation.Boasting Oscar-nominated cinematography by long-time Coen Brothers collaborator Roger Deakins, this is one of the finest looking mainstream thrillers in years. Drenched in grey, the miserable colour palette drapes the film in a feeling of foreboding dread. It brings to mind the beautiful and superior thriller Zodiac (2007), only without the period setting. It drags - and it does drag - on for 2 and a half hours, and the film is so lacking in humour that any realism the film was striving for suffers. It also stars Hugh Jackman, possibly the most effortlessly likable actor working today, and watching him bang on the wall shouting \"where is my daughter!?\" - a line that should have been retired after Taken (2008) - is silly and unconvincing. The film takes itself so seriously that it almost becomes a parody of itself.Gyllenhaal as Loki, however, is outstanding, and is a character I wish the film focused more on. With neck tattoos, a strange, buttoned-up (with no tie) appearance, slick-back hair, and blinking tic, it hints at a more interesting character than the film fully allows to develop. The film is more interested in not-so-subtle War on Terror parallels and comments on post-9/11 vigilantism, that sadly struggles to keep a hold of it's ever-widening plot and multiple plot strands, over-reaching itself constantly with scenes of stoic uber-seriousness. But it's splendidly filmed, and beautifully performed by Gyllenhaal, Dano and Melissa Leo (playing Alex's mother), which could have done with some heavier editing and less self-importance.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",

The little details left to speculation regarding Gyllenhaal's character (Detective Loki) are what piques my curiosity the most, and the mutliple layers to the mysteries in the movie keep you at the edge of your seat.

Let me explain first that this film is the complete opposite of feel-good cinema, and I do not recommend it to everyone. You are placed at the epicenter of one of the more sickening stories in recent memory and are forced to question your morality, your ethics, and far you would go past them for you loved ones. Prisoners is unsettling, unnerving, squirm-inducing and twisty. Its script keeps you in a quantum state of uncertainty, with suspense that intensifies like the breath-squeezing embrace of a boa. The sobering cinematography and low-key directing add to this effect and make Prisoners brilliantly atmospheric. It's been a long time since I've felt so suffocated with intimidation.Prisoners gets 4.5 stars and not the magical 5. This is due to the lack of a proper score. The silence works well most of the time and in some scenes works perfectly. However, Prisoners is hard hitting and intense, and a more powerful score would have made the stronger scenes feel much more hair-raising. I know that sounds like nit-picking, but a 5 star movie needs to be damn perfect in every aspect.No matter. Prisoners is an all-consuming challenge that requires your strictest attention. The acting from its ensemble cast is stellar, particularly from Hugh Jackman (Wolverine) and Jake Gyllenhaal (Donnie Darko). Prisoners is a hard film to sit through, but has an addictive cocktail of ambiguity, suspense, and moral complexity. And like it or not, it drags you by the scruff of the neck to a nerve-wracking and jaw- dropping conclusion. Prisoners is good. No, it's better than good. It's brilliant.",

            "content": "Prisoners is a chilling film that has an unsettling music and gray tones that will tight your chest from the first minutes. Prisoners has also a great cast, intrigue, suspense, and a powerful reflection on some important moral issues. To me, the beauty of this film relies on its powerful reflection on the ethics of taking justice in your hands. When and why, if ever, torture is justified; my reaction is, as has always been, a resounding no. There is also the question, if you knew that you would save some people's lives by torturing a person, would you do it or be ethically excusable? My answer is a less resounding no. On the other hand, the story asks you who is worst, the person who kidnaps a child or the abductee's father who tortures somebody to save his child. Finally, if you know that somebody is taking justice in their hands and you don't denounce them or watch impassibly, are you as guilty as the perpetrator? The story of the investigation to find the missing girls was building up well during the first half of the movie. However, the second half is a clumsy pointless wandering that doesn't help to build momentum, it builds frustration. When we discover who the baddie is, the reasons behind his/her actions are so stupid that I couldn't believe that the scriptwriters had come up with a such a thing! Finally, I found a bit unfair that two girls disappear and the story is mostly about the Kellers' sorrow, not as much as the Birches' pain, and they seem to be not having any except for some few moments in the film. Regarding the cast, I thought all the actors do a good job overall. I usually love Gyllenhaal but I found he was just all right here, except for some sporadic sparks of his best acting; I loved his blinking tick, though. It was refreshing seeing Jackman playing something dramatic and very different from his usual roles; unfortunately, I thought he was overacting, and I didn't believe for a second that he was Keller, I thought he was Jackman trying to be Keller, which is something slightly different. On the contrary, Maria Bello really feels like she's a mother in distress. Viola Davis has that powerful mix of balanced sorrow and fragility that many people display when tragedy strikes. Paul Dano is just awesome as the mentally-challenged guy on which all suspicions seem to fall. I am surprised that Melissa Leo was nominated for an Oscar; she's good in the film, but not better than Maria Bello or Dano! A good movie, with a clumsy script, food for thought, and a Hollywood ending. I thought, if Koreans had done this movie, we have got a fair ending.",

            "content": "Denis Villeneuve's \"Prisoners\" is not only one of the best movies of 2013 but also one of the best movies of the decade, and as well as being a very Hitchcockian type of movie. The movie stars Hugh Jackman in the best performance of his career so far as Keller Dover who in the beginning of the movie brings his wife Grace (Maria Bello), and his daughter Anna (Erin Gerasimovich) over to their friend Franklin Birch's (Terrence Howard) house who also happens to have a wife named Nancy (Viola Davis) and they have a daughter named Eliza (Zoe Soul). As soon as the Dover's arrive at the Birch's house the two girls are doing what little kids do which is play together. Then the unthinkable happens... Both girls end up going missing under mysterious circumstances. Then later in the movie the police is called and the lead detective on the case is a policeman named Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal). Then we wonder when the two girls are going to be found. With this movie Villeneuve has crafted Hitchcock like tales such as \"The Silence of the Lambs\" (1991), \"Sunset Boulevard\" (1950), \"Witness for the Prosecution\" (1957), and many others. Then by the time the end comes along Keller finds the woman who kidnapped the two girls who happens to be an older woman named Holly Jones (Melissa Leo). I won't spoil anything beyond this point because all of the other major moments including the ending are much too valuable to be spoiled. The acting in this movie is so good while most importantly Jackman and Gyllenhaal as the lead characters give such good performances that they were snubbed for Oscar nominations, and the supporting performances from Bello, Howard, Davis, and Leo are so good in this movie that Leo's performance is the darkest throughout this entire film. Because of this movie I can't wait to see more of Villeneuve's work such as \"Incendies\" (2010), \"Sicario\" (2015), and \"Arrival\" (2016).

            "content": "I saw \"Prisoners\", starring Hugh Jackman-Les Miserables-2012, Van Helsing; Jake Gyllenhaal-End of Watch, Brokeback Mountain; Terrence Howard-Red Tails, Big Momma's House; Maria Bello-Grown Ups, Coyote Ugly and Paul Dano-Cowboys & Aliens, There Will Be Blood.This is a tense edge-of-the-seat thriller with some hidden surprises. Hugh and Maria are visiting their neighbors during the Thanksgiving holidays when something happens that every parent dreads. Their six year old daughter and the daughter of their friend Terrence disappear. After searching everywhere, the only clue is a suspicious looking RV that was seen in the neighborhood. The police are called in and Jake is the head detective; he has a reputation for solving all of his cases. Paul is spotted in the RV and arrested but no physical evidence is found of the missing girls. With no evidence, Paul is released which does not sit well with Hugh, who decides to take matters into his own hands. The question of how far a father would go to get his daughter back is explored and then you have the idea of whether Paul is even the right guy or not. Paul has a stunted mental capacity of a ten year old, and there are other suspects, so questions are raised. I thought it was also realistically portrayed how some people will turn to drinking or drug use to cope with the stress of a missing child. FYI: There is a scene, during an interrogation, that I could have sworn a policeman calls Jake by his real name-it was something like,'Let me know if you find out anything, Gyllenhaal.' Anyway, I enjoyed the movie but the ending was kind of off; It was kind of abrupt, as if they were trying to wrap it up. It is rated \"R\" for violence-including scenes of torture, language and drug/alcohol use and has a running time of 2 hours & 33 minutes. It was a nice thriller but I don't think that I would buy it on DVD-once was enough. It would be a good rental, though.",

            "content": "Prisoners tells the story of a family broken by the kidnapping of their small daughter along with one of her friends. Unsatisfied with the police actions in the case, the father tries to take matters into his own hands.This is a very tense movie. We follow Keller Dover as he desperately tries to find the truth about what happened to his daughter. Right in the beginning we get a feel that this is a man that does what he needs and doesn't like depending on others, even the government.On the other side, we have Det. Loki, a cop with his own personal problems that is assigned to this case. We see he is actually trying to get things done. I guess it felt nice seeing an investigator that is actually human for a change, and not a Super Deduction Machine. I love Sherlock Holmes as much as the next guy, but sometimes is nice to see a regular one, specially since this is an overused trope. Not that he is stupid or anything, he just feels more real in the way he follows clues and draws his conclusions.Hugh Jackman is in full shape, showing the evolution of his characters desperation as he sees, powerless, his family falling apart. When he decides to act in a certain way, we may not agree with it, or even think he may be making a mistake, but we never doubt his motivations, and his choices feel authentic. Jake Gyllenhaal also does a great job as the detective trying to find the truth, and so we get a nice back and forth between these two characters, as in who should we trust, who should we root for?All of this is sewed together by a great story. Mystery permeates the movie and the developments are made in a way that make you never completely sure about what the truth really is. Thus, even if this movie has a slow pace, with beautiful and calm cinematography, not packed with explosions, you still feel at the edge of your seat.The script here is flawless both as a suspense and a crime story. When you get to the end you feel it in your guts. This is not a movie you will soon forget.A great experience. 10/10.",

I can usually guess most of where a movie is going and I have to say that I did guess most of this one but that didn't keep me from liking the movie and there were a few things that surprise me (which is very rare). It is a movie that will make you think some and for that its a good movie.It's suppose to be high drama but there were some humorous parts and even with the gravity of the end I found myself laughing at it. I'm not sure if I was suppose to but it was funny, the expression on Det. Loki's face.",

He did lead to it by taking them to \"play\" but the aunt obviously kidnapped them and kept them. Also the guy who killed himself I get why he's doing the maze and the movie he was inspired by but they could've tied in the maze more with the aunt.

So my expectations rose and I was sort of carrying a real time rating meter in hand - trying to push myself to rate it while I was watching it and really I could not find any moment where I would have given it 7 out of 10...hence overall 8!Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal have both played a great role especially Jackman. I can say this is his one of the best roles. His acting is commendable - as a helpless and tired dad but the one who is ready to do anything possible (or even impossible) to find his daughter and he did all he could while facing push back from all people around him. He broke the rules for good and kept trying. Overall, awesome acting by all. Kudos to the director Denis Villeneuve and his entire team. Very emotional and suspenseful movie which will keep your heart pounding all the time. You fight with hope and reality and in the end wish for everything to end well.

On the other hand, if you are in the frame of mind for a whole bunch of creepy haunted house sequences and prepared to tolerate some rather nasty scenes, then you may well enjoy the way it develops.

The detective as portrayed by Jack Gyllenhall has delivered a gritty and subdued performance in his pursuit to solve the case. Cinematography by Roger Deakins captures the chilly mood of the location as the essence of the characters. The 'suspense' part of the movie is fairly guessable for the average movie goer.

When the two girls went missing you can just tell things are going to get very serious and suffocating. And yes the suspense was absolutely amazing in this film. You will feel for the characters.You can understand Keller. He has the wild and natural side of human beings. He want it to be fists and blood. Combat and contact. How he kidnapped Alex because the police couldn't do anything with him. I mean if you have a daughter you'll know how it feels I guess. You'll actually want that hammer to go through Alex's hand instead of that stupid basin.At the same time you'll be desperate trying to get through to Alex's head, that weird shaped container that keeps all the exclusive information. This frustration will slowly creep up on you, the limit of our technology, the complexity of human emotions and ideas, and the idea of self.And then you got suspect Bob creepily touching the bear doll at the gathering.. and you'll wonder why don't we just shoot all these freaks already instead of let them walk around buying children's clothes and drenching them in pig blood. I mean you can see it right? It's right there. All those people online sharing child abuse photos and videos. You can see them.It was fairly satisfying watching Loki threw Bob against the wall when he caught him. And that pity feeling and frustration when he got the chance to kill himself quickly, getting away so easily, breaking the lead.Made my blood boil when the aunt finally reveal herself as well. Cult. Another cult. I mean you can just tell what is weird and evil and what is not in real life. You can feel it. It might take you some time to figure out how to justify yourself to other people but please don't give me that \"it's everyone's freedom to believe what you want\" BS. You can but you can't. Sometimes you can't even use the word \"belief\" on this because that's too general. Some beliefs are benign. But this, this is just weird and wrong. It's a cult that make people kidnap and kill innocent kids, to wage war on god. I mean come on. Is it really that NOT obvious??What can you do when you know something is wrong and those people are crazy? What can democracy, freedom, your law and value do in this specific scenario?\nYou know what save the effort. In their eyes you are crazy, and you're violating their right to believe. Your judge, your government and law as well as your amendment will tell you to sit down. Your concerns don't mean anything to them.\nThe root of these religious beliefs is very dull and simple minded. Either with them or not. Right or wrong. Live or die. But you can smell it. Something is just not right. Someone out there wants to build a wall as well. It seems like a lot of people mock that idea but nobody can do anything about it. You see what I mean?\nThis system won't let you do anything though, until there is bloodshed. And yes that means it's too late.But then it's a hard nut to crack I know. You can have 24 surveillance for crimes and risks but there are always people who got detested by that idea. Sure. Why not. I'm not advocating full on scrutiny on personal aspects. But something needs to be done.I'm glad this movie has a good ending. This is a great movie. But a movie is a movie. It makes sense. In real life this simply wouldn't be the same case.",

Meanwhile the detective in charge stars to to follow the father steps as he is getting justice on his hands, while also becoming crazy at it. The theme of \"From Man to beast\" is excellent, as our main character is the traditional Christian masculine dad, becomes a literal demon torturing a somewhat innocent fellow (who turns out was a victim after all). And all to continue to be the hero, the provider, the protector ending to be the victim of a 'weak' person. Similar to Detective Loki who has resolve his past cases is now desperate as he sees all lost with this one. The directing is great, the story has also its merits not only is pretty awesome to have an original screenplay once for a while and there are so many plot twists you are just guessing \"Is he really the raptor?\" \"Was he involved?\" so i guess it accomplishes it's goal perfectly. Everybody talks about the Cinematography by Dickens and indeed is one of best (if not the best) aspects of the film, not only does it look gorgeous, the lighting is great, the clich\u00c3\u00a9d teal and orange color palette works here and the atmosphere is amusing. To an extent i didn't think about it until now, but as someone said to me \"if you don't notice the cinematography on a film, you did something right\".

I have always enjoyed Jake Gyllenhaal's performances (Donnie Darko, The Source Code), and always respected his ability to act, alongside Hugh Jackman's excellent performance as a father who will do anything to bring back his child. I walked into 'Prisoners' with no expectations; in fact I barely knew what the movie was about. I read somewhere it was a 'Taken' clone, but that is a huge disservice to the direction, screen writing and most importantly the cinematography shown in the film. The film was so incredibly moody, falling into a similar category as 'Se7en' and 'Silence of the Lambs'. One or two scenes overstayed their welcome by a minute or so, and Jackman may be overacting to some, but I think he hit the nail on the head. Gyllenhaal also portrayed an incredibly weary and tired police officer, who becomes increasingly suspicious and twitchy as the film progresses. His performance carried the film, in my opinion. The basements were dusty and the X-Files-esque flashlights pierced the fog, while the snowy environment gave the film a cold, clinical feel. Roger Deakins has never deserved a reward for his cinematography more, and is one of my biggest inspirations in the field. The film is beautiful, while retaining a dark, sinister feel. Unfortunately, Gravity broke so many boundaries in the cinematographic field, and will likely receive more credit for 2013s cinematography. A shame, Deakins has shown his skill multiple times without any reward (outside of fame and money, obviously) in the academy and such, especially after 'Skyfall' in 2012. Outside of this, the film displays an excellent dissection of morality on a fundamental basis, and it left me thinking for a long time afterwards. The film is so pleasing to watch but oh so chilling and dark. I recommend this film to anyone, but not the faint of heart, it does get messy.Excerpt from 2013 - a year in review: www.perksandpeeves.wordpress.com",

            "content": "For quite some period of time no other thriller film gave us the opportunity to exceed the level of our expectations that much as \"Prisoners\". If we take into account the fact that the whole genre is characterized by a small share in the overall production, scarce production budgets and minimal promotion, no wonder that we rarely get more than a medium-quality generic job work. However, the Prisoners' pedigree implicitly suggested that that could yield something much more interesting. The starry cast leaded by Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal together with a promising Canadian director, Denis Villeneuve and scenario writer, Aaron Guzikowski, definitively have brought some new blood in a stagnant genre.The plot of Prisoners intertwined with dilemmas and intriguing reversals maintains a high level of tension throughout the whole 153-minut period. The search for the lost girls leads us through dump houses, depressive landscapes, endless rain, cold, from a clue to a clue just to end up in a vicious circle and falling down deeper and deeper into hopelessness under a watchful eye of sophistical-dark vision created by the director of photography Roger Deakins. And while the solution starts to stumble in the attempt to find the connection between the clues, the skepticism retreats under a strong atmosphere dominated by the contrasts of light and dark bringing about a surreal space \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a space where the battle between good and evil is fought . Precisely the emphasis placed on that dimension allows the film to pass beyond the limits of the whodunit framework and places the work above an average thriller.",

Is violence justified only because it will help bring them back from hand of the evil?'Prisoners' which released in India two weeks later than America is a must watch had anyone missed the chills and atmospherics of thriller classics such as 'Se7en' and 'Zodiac'. Its the story of a desperate father taking matters into his own hands after his daughter and her friend go missing and the police discharges the prime suspect in the case. Directed by Denis Villeneuve, the film provides an introspection on our moral grounds at times when evil lurks around. Touching the themes of torture and violence, it is an engaging (at the same time - disturbing) drama. The contorted twist towards the end turns it into a thrilling mystery leaving us puzzled as looking for answers.Supported by a brilliant caste, the pace of the screenplay gets an uplift by their natural stance and the brilliance of their performance delivery. Hugh Jackman as the father and Jake Gyllenhaal as the frustrated lead investigator prove to be the perfect choice for the roles. Paul Dano as Alex Jones - the prime suspect plays his character so profoundly that we will hate and pity him at the same time. Stark photography by 10 times Oscar nominee Roger Deakins provides the atmospherics and the chills that completely draws us into the drama set in cold and bleak streets.With 'Rush' released the week before and 'Prisoners' matching up, maybe the Oscar season has already started.",

Hugh Jackman is masterful in his role, Jake Gyllenhall does enough to be convincing and the rest of the cast do their bit admirably. The film is shot beautifully with the camera always roving a' la Robert Altman and some shots are really worthy of a Terrence Mallick comparison.\"Prisoners\" is ultimately neither about the plot or the persons. It is a solemn recognition of the easily corruptible human nature which goes to great lengths to justify its means with its ends.

You know there's a back story there with all the clues and emphasis on behavior, mannerisms, and appearance in general. Also actress Melissa Leo, known for her riveting performances in Frozen River and The Fighter, totally engrosses herself in her respective character in which she worked very hard to make herself appear older and worn. This story allows you to solve the puzzle at the same speed as it's characters while asking yourself the same questions. Although both the film's writer Aaron Guzikowski and its Canadian Director Denis Villeneuve are virtually unknowns in Hollywood, their pairing with legendary cinematographer Roger Deakins made this a beautifully shot film as well. The images of weather and landscape are as cold, dark, dreary, and depressing as the film itself which makes it all the more chilling. - Reviewed by AN/NR 09-20-2013",

It can mean that the acting is superb.We cannot judge a movie by our limitations, our prejudices or our way of conceiving life.

When you see an actor play the same character so much they might as well be on a TV series so it was nice to see him do something else.You got Terrence Howard, Viola Davis, Maria Bello and Paul Dano who's come so far since the silent older bro. in Little Miss Sunshine. I will add though that Hugh's performance didn't come close to Sean Penn in Mystic River. However the only one i had a problem with was Jake Gyllenhal. This was not one of his better performances and i didn't too much like his character.He reminded me of Brad Pitt in Seven; too headstrong, impatient and not that great a detective. Definitely could've had more of a detective Stabler (L&O SVU) type character (someone with kids). As far as the story goes it was a hot mess. I mean half the time we're following the detective around-not nearly enough parents POV to get the right emotion and then half the crap didn't make any sense with that creepy dude who offed himself.I really didn't think those scenes were that relevant and then the motives of the actual abductor didn't make sense but that doesn't matter cause half the crazy crap people do in real life doesn't make sense.

Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal give shocking performances as the two people leading the search for the girls with the pressure and the anxiety of their task seeping through their performances. Denis Villeneuve combines his talents as a director with the greatest cinematographer of all time Roger Deakins to create beautiful yet haunting shots throughout the film. The imagery is powerful and combined with the distressing story it can lead to some truly shocking moments with a moment in particular when a revelation about the girls is discovered gives me shivers every time I watch it. The score pounds, the colors turn grey and the fear and trauma of the characters can be felt and it's as if out of a horror movie. Not to even mention the incredible final act. The film is well paced and wastes no time from its two and a half hour run time making every second of the film count in the search for the girls.

God gave him a test, let his daughter disappeared, and gave him a very suspicious candidate for the murderer, as a result, he will lose himself in this test, and finally committed the crime of hurting others.",

I'll just keep things simple and short (unlike this movie). -The first hour was bland, and the second hour was incredible. -Jake Gyllenhaal was outstanding, as were Dano, Davis and Howard. -Hugh Jackman was not good. Overacting in some parts, stiff and wooden in others, though that might be down to the simplicity of his character and a lack of overall development. -Writing was good, if a little plain. -Some of the cinematography was really nice, especially the close up shots of Alex while he's trapped. -I really enjoyed the ending. I loved how not everything was wrapped up in a simple bow like a lot of movies are: it represents reality and how things may work out, though not everything will. It also left the viewer to fill in the blanks for themselves, which I quite liked. Does Loki find Keller in the end? Does Keller die in the hole? Is Keller already dead in the hole? Who knows?Should you watch this movie? Yes. Will you enjoy it? Maybe. Was it good? Yes. It all comes down to personal preference. This movie compared to the likes of Gyllenhaal's other best performances in my opinion, Zodiac and Nightcrawler, this fell short of the mark, though Jake was extraordinary yet again.",

            "content": "Never has a film of this caliber shaken me and begged me to ask the question, \"if my child was taken, how far am I willing to go?\" In Denis Villeneuve's gripping and powerful drama about the abduction of two little girls and the extreme measures one father takes to find his daughter, the film rings in emotions of panic, fear, sadness, horror and shock all wrapped into two and a half hours of tension. Twists and turns drive the action of the story to its dramatic and shocking conclusion.The casting of the film is beyond brilliant. Hugh Jackman delivers a shocking and powerful performance as Keller Dover, father to one of the missing girls, who is unwilling to sit idly by and wait for the police to find the children. He takes the law swiftly into his own hands by horrifically tortures the young man (Paul Dano) he believes has taken the children; the torture scenes led me to turn away at numerous points of the film. Watching Jackman's performance hits a chord deep inside himself as a parent in real life in addition to the fictional portrayal of the desperate father who will kill to have his daughter back. Even as a viewer, his talent in the role and the intensity it requires tugged at my heartstrings through the painful moments of the impact of the kidnapping to the horror of his actions against Alex Jones (Paul Dano), the tension the events cause in his marriage to his wife Grace (Maria Bello) and seeing him push away anyone who tries to help him (Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal), Franklin and Nancy Birch, parents of the other kidnapped child (Terrence Howard and Viola Davis)). An Oscar-worthy performance here.Playing opposite Jackman in the desperate search is Detective Loki, superbly played by Jake Gyllenhaal, an officer who has never left a case unsolved. But when he delves into the abduction of these two children, Loki is more than prepared to do everything in his power as a law enforcement officer to bring them home. The conflict between Jackman and Gyllenhaal pulls the viewer back and forth as time grows shorter and the search more desperate, providing insight into the difference between the by-the-book Detective Loki and loose cannon Keller Dover. Only when the final hours are ticking away do we see Gyllenhaal finally crack and break his own rules in order to cement his reputation of efficiency. If you dare to answer the above question of \"how far would I go to get my child back?\" PRISONERS will still make you question your own motives.",

The story opens in a dark and foreboding country town, shot beautifully by the masterful Roger Deakins. Soon after we meet Keller Dover, his innocent little girl vanishes without a trace. Thanks to the spectacularly dark performance by Hugh Jackman, the pain and anguish is felt like nothing else. The original suspect, Alex Jones (played by a perfectly cast Paul Dano) implies his own guilt to Dover, and it is this moment that sets the story and what the title \"Prisoners\" actually means.How far is Dover willing to go to find his daughter, the literal prisoner of an unknown captor? Detective Loki is imprisoned by his impeccable reputation, which means that he feels even greater pressure to find and rescue the girls. The film is spectacularly written, with red herrings that give the audience doubt that one character is on the right track, only to sideswipe them with a revelation that not only keeps you guessing, but fits superbly into the overall story. The story doesn't feel forced for even a moment, and everything pieces together for a superb overall take. The direction is spectacular, creating a lingering sense of dread that permeates the picture. One of the most underrated films of 2013, Prisoners sees Jackman is at his absolute best and is a superbly satisfying drama.",

            "review_title": "Universal Imprisonment",
            "content": "The title Prisoners suggests far more than the viewer would be led to believe. There are the obvious forms in that of the kidnapped children and the possible suspect, Alex (Paul Dano), whom one of the girl's fathers, Keller (Hugh Jackman), abducts to retrieve information from. However, these two examples are only the surface of both film and title as Denis Villeneuve's two-and-a-half hour crime thriller is a case of a cryptic nature.Exploring the film, we are first greeted by the image of a forest \u2013 an establishing mechanism to give the feel of the wild \u2013 as Keller recites the \"Our Father\" and his son shoots and kills his first deer. Keller congratulates his son and remarks that if his father ever taught him anything it was to, \"Pray for the best, prepare for the worst.\" This exposition places Keller as a primal being; a man that clearly recognizes the importance that the father serves and categorizes hunting as a rite of passage (the importance of the first kill and the religious connotation he places over the act reinforce that). Now, juxtaposed with Keller is Franklin (Terrence Howard): father to Joy (Kyla Simmons), who along with Keller's daughter, Anna (Erin Gerasimovich), are the abductees. The first time we meet Franklin is on Thanksgiving \u2013 the day of the kidnapping \u2013 with a trumpet in hand as he plays an awful rendition of, \"The Star Spangled Banner\" (a song that Keller is jokingly rumored to sing in the shower).Delving further into the picture, we meet Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal), the officer assigned to the missing persons case and our balance between good and evil. Our introduction to Loki is on Thanksgiving as well and while Keller and Franklin celebrate the holiday together with their families \u2013 unknowing of their daughters' abduction \u2013 our triumphant detective sits alone in an Asian diner. A self- implemented sense of isolation perhaps due to some past discrepancy is felt. Wholly dedicated to his job it is rare that we see Loki anywhere but the office or patrolling \u2013 to be honest I cannot remember if we ever see the man at his home \u2013 leading to notion of imprisonment by his occupation.Now, the theory of universal imprisonment in the film is further implemented by Roger Deakins' cinematography. Most houses are shot like enormous multi-room jail cells and moments when the cameras hover above Loki at his desk feel darkly voyeuristic (as if we are viewing the man not through the fourth wall but plexiglass). In fact, one of the most interesting aspects I found of the film is that the only literal prisoners - being the daughters and Alex \u2013 are rarely ever seen. The film is not about them as much as it is the captives who believe to be free, who believe to be in the right.This sense of morality can be explored through Keller and Franklin. In the aforementioned opening scenes the polarity created between the two men could not be greater and that is where much of the film's greatest tension comes from as well. On one hand, you have the devout Christian, a patriot, a former alcoholic \u2013 clearly a flawed yet conscious man - whose primal tendencies may very well lead him to solving the puzzle. While on the other, you have the nuclear familial father: knit sweater, non-threatening lifestyle, and an overall sense of right and wrong. A man who is thrown into the \"act now, think later\" mentality of Keller and begins to suffer from attacks on his own sense of morality. Our foundation of the film is the image of one father with gun in hand and the other with a trumpet. How could one expect them to work together in a cohesive manner?This sense of chaos and the balance that Loki instills keeps any possibility of these characters being shackled at bay. It is not until the film's third act when the \"big reveal\" is made that we realize truly how much the title, Prisoners, encapsulates. It is a marvelous twist in not the way that it makes the viewer gasp but the depth it adds to each and every character. The surface it seamlessly breaks allowing for a distinct emotional connection to form. It is the knowledge of Keller's father's suicide and his alcoholism that creates the notion that while he is our anti-hero, he suffers from deep abandonment issues (creating the driving force in his actions of doing anything to save his child) and is as much of a prisoner of himself as the others in the film. It is not until the red herring sub-plot of Bob Taylor (David Dastmalachian) \u2013 a grown man who was kidnapped as a child and has since never been able to escape the sensations of it - that the viewer is able to understand the psychological ramifications of imprisonment. I have seen critics complain about the use of the character, Bob Taylor, yet it is through his demise that we are able to finally view characters such as Keller, Franklin, and Loki through a new lens that creates the understanding and empathy necessary to immerse yourself with the picture.While it only covers a mere week, Prisoners is a generational exploration of the ways people can place themselves and others in various forms of imprisonment. Whether it is the emotional captivity \u2013 due to the absence of Anna - of Keller's wife, Grace (Maria Bello), or the mental arrest placed on Alex's childhood that has led him to where he is now. Prisoners suggests that whether you are in a box, a locked room, at your job, or at home with your family, none of us are really free and it is because of our pasts and the choices of others that we subconsciously continue to shackle ourselves.",

With incredible performances from Hugh Jackman, Paul Dano, Melissa Leo, and Viola Davis, every single actor and actress did their part in this film.

This is easily not a film for the faint of heart or parents. It's a very tough watch thanks to the astounding direction by Denis Villeneuve, who always keeps you guessing until the very end. The score is very anxiety-inducing, which definitely sets the tone for the scenes that use it, but I was honestly surprised this wasn't a score heavy film. The majority of the violent scenes were silent, which made them hit so much harder.Prisoners is definitely not a film for everyone, but if you want to see some freaking ACTING, then this film is most definitely a must-watch. The 2 and a half hours practically fly by because this movie knows you desperately want to know if the children even make it out alive. Hugh Jackman's performance is probably worth watching it alone.",

Sadly though, the writing is a bit of a letdown and we are left with numerous unanswered questions and directionless subplots.

We can start with the casting of actors in which the performance of Jake Gyllenhaal as Detective Loki is marvelous and finishing with an extraordinary Hugh Jackman as Keller Dover, father of one of the kidnapped girls. I feel that I'm in debt with this character because it is one of the best acting I've ever seen on the big screen. His desperation for finding his daughter is so real that you will feel the tension during the whole film. According to what I've read Hugh Jackman even spent several nights without sleeping in order to make that impression during the shooting of the film. On the other hand, the plot cannot be more interesting and intriguing so you will see yourself trying to figure out who is the responsible of the disappearance of the little girls. Despite kidnapping of kids in Hollywood movies are pretty common, the production and direction of Prisoners is completely different. I don't usually give points easily on this website but I will do an exception with this one because I ended up totally impressed and open-mouthed. I gave nine points without any kind of hesitation. I'm looking forward to watching the next part of Prisoners because the ending of the film lead to believe that there will be a second part. I strongly recommend you to watch it.

            "content": "It starts off with the parents frantically looking for the kids and retracing their steps to look for clues to there whereabouts. The parents check all places after they have exhausted all other leads, then the older brother of Anna and older sister of Joy recall the kids playing on a van outside on the street and how hard they fought to get them away from it. The family decided to call the police giving this as good place to start.The the van is eventually found that same night and the driver tries to escape but ends up running the van into a pole in the struggle to get away. Soon after the cops try to interrogate the driver Alex Jones and he is let go on the grounds that he is mentally unfit to cooperate with interrogation and is released to his Aunt. ,Keller Dover Anna's father hears of his release and goes to the police station to try his hand in the interrogation and ends up wrestling with him until they are both pulled apart Alex whispers to him loud enough to where he can hear it but low enough to where he would be the only one Alex told him.\"They only started to cry when I left\" This gives the story a creepy edge to it that no one can deny at the time. The detective Loki searching for clues and the midst of this the father kidnaps Alex and tortures him to try and find his daughter after he hears Alex singing the same song his daughter sang on the day she was taken Keller finds after days of searching this is the only alternative The detective follows up on a lead after he gets the plate number from thestore clerk and gets an address there after he shows up and everything was pretty formal up to when Loki started asking questions about the girls then he started to panic and try to shut the door in the detectives face. Loki then restrains him and starts looking for the girls in the house nothing there except all the writing in the house being creepy drawings of an obvious psychopath. Loki finds a group of suitcases in a room that was shut in the house he opens all of them to find snakes and bloody clothes of children. He then brings Keller and the Other daughters family in to verify articles of clothing Joy's family comes out of the office crying and it doesn't leave Keller much hope many of them were not a match for Keller daughter except her pink sock which he seen was definitely hers covered in blood stains. He then takes off to torture Alex one last and final time because he believes his daughter to be dead and he thinks its Alex s fault. Loki does more investigation work and interrogates the mystery guy ends up killing himself with Loki's gun after he starts babbling about the maze and never getting out. Loki is left really with no other options. Keller then goes to the house Alex stayed at apologize for overreacting with Alex and he gets the background of Alex and how he was related to her and how her husband isn't around anymore. After leaving Alex's aunts house he is called and told that the other girl Joy was found and she is in the hospital and she is recovering Keller cares of her well being but still tries to asks her where his daughter is and if she is OK Joy lifts up her head with a terrified suspenseful look said \"she tied us up with duct tape\" and that gave all what Keller needed to make his next move he returned to Alex's aunts house with a handyman tool kit to fix some things in her house to get inside to look around. Keller then tells the old woman \"I don't want to have to hurt you\" and the woman pulls a gun on Keller and says she has his daughter and then proceeds to tell him shes been kidnapping and killing kids for years. Alex's aunt and her husband were proud of it Alex's aunt said there's only one way to his daughter and that is to drink a recipe her and her husband made to drug induce motor skills of its victims and put them in a daze to where there really is no fighting back. Alex's aunt then proceeds to put Keller where he had his daughter when the police came looking around and is left there. Inevitably finding Anna at the kidnappers house through detective work of things introduced earlier on that come to light later in the story Loki shows up at the kidnappers house shoots her when she pulls a gun on him and shoots him in the eye he is injured rushing to the EM for treatment for Anna. A lot of mystery movies are doing this these days but the ending of the movie just before the Detective Loki shows up to stop the kidnapper the father of one the girl that didn't escape earlier on is still down in the cellar underneath the old muscle car in the yard. Because of this finding at the kidnappers house the house is obviously stripped searched and just before everyone goes home form digging up the yard all day Loki hears a faint whistle in the background and fades to black so the Director decided to end the movie this way more suspenseful i suspect.The movie did very well on its opening into the family scene how they did and put everyone in a down spiral and show just who you really are when faced with such a horrible thing and how things unravel. A sense of reality so to speak and the actors did a good job portraying their characters the movie has got a good solid plot to it.",

Each character play out their roles with solid performances, solid enough to become emotionally attached and sharing some part of the pain they are feeling. The films tempo is also nicely applied, applied correctly so that throughout each scene, you become interested and curious as to what may happen. Much of the storytelling is done in a stripped back style, a muck more basic ground of storytelling but an elegance that makes it so fulfilling and worth much more than that. If ever you've played the game The Last of Us, then you''ll understand what I am trying to explain. Overall I highly praise this film for being such a great watch, but also the feelings I was given whilst watching this movie, such as; suspense, intimidation and the thoughts of each scene I still have after reaching the conclusion of this film. If ever you gain an opportunity to watch this film, I highly recommend you go and see it.",

            "content": "Saw this almost three weeks ago but was never really tempted to write a review. I've always liked writing reviews for movies, and i've always loved writing on IMDb, until recently. For some reason, I don't seem to agree with most of the reviews and ratings for many movies, but it's perfectly subjective whether a movie is good or not. Anyway, prisoners is not so bad. This movie has so much potential, especially with all the great actors in the movie. Unfortunately, the supposed to be great story line fell of short due to the darn long duration and not so convincing acting of the actors. First thing first, what's good about the movie. There are so many famous and talented actors in this movie. The idea of the story is actually quite good, it's a typical kidnap story but its not quite predictable. Now the bad thing about this movie. The story line is thrilling, but only during the first 30 minutes of the movie. Then the movie just drags the story all the way for almost 3 hours and didn't achieve much. Hell, even after i waited for 2 and a half hours , i still never got my ending. The movie didn't have an ending. It was an open ending, where the director doesn't give any closure to the story, leaving the audience to think and imagine for themselves whats going to happen next. The bunch of famous actors who are supposed to be talented were for some reason not talented at all in this movie. Their acting was terrible! No one was convincing whatsoever. Its like they didn't even bother trying. I'm so disappointed for many reasons. 1, the thriller was nice. 2, Hugh Jackman and a few other famous actors are in the movie. 3, the reviews are all so good. 4, thriller is my favorite movie genre and this movie was not that thrilling, on a scale of 1-10 the thrilling factor is maybe 3, and it was at the beginning of the movie when the children got kidnapped, oh and during the beat up session where the guy's face was shown all bloody and bloated. Overall, this movie deserves a 4/10.",

Intentions seem to be in the right place, delivery is going smoothly, there's a handful of ups and downs that aren't terribly clich\u00e9 but you swear you've heard one or two before, and when all is said and done you nod in approval and open the door knowing they'll be back soon in another form with another tale.Comparisons to strange friends aside, Prisoners does its best to keep a child abduction story above Lifetime Movie levels. What does this is the acting of the two leads, Jake Gyllenhaal and Hugh Jackman, and the violence both on display and implied. Jackman convincingly continues down a rabbit hole of anger and frustration as a distressed father, and Gyllenhaal almost follows suite as the detective assigned to the case. Both elevate the material a bit, but neither can save it from the excessive runtime of 2 1/2 hours and a handful of mystery/suspense clich\u00e9s.

            "content": "What do you say after watching a movie like Prisoners? What words can describe the intense emotional crisis it instills in you? The moral dilemma it puts you in? The only thing one can blame this movie for is the psychological impact it will have on the viewer while and after watching it. Everything worked perfectly to bring 'Prisoners' to life.I'll start off by acknowledging the brilliance of director of photography Roger Deakins (A.S.C) on this film. Most people don't realize how crucial the cinematography of a film is and how it affects the story. Deakins created the quintessential atmosphere for a movie with such a story as Prisoners, blending it in with its (the movie) cause. The dark stormy weather, the snow cover, the wet roads, the calm ghostly neighborhood etc all these elements came together to enhance the constant feeling of dread you experience. Roger Deakins selected the right lenses and produced the right lighting necessary for the movie's gloomy appearance. I admire director Denis Villeneuve for understanding the importance of the visual aspect of Prisoners and fastidiously focusing a great deal on it. He and Roger worked together to create the atmosphere fit for a crime/drama/thriller, which is the kind you find in pictures like Shutter Island, The woman in Black, The Descent, Silent Hill etc. This should be a paradigm for flicks of these genres. If it had been set on a beautiful sunny day in a noisy neighborhood with Hispanic Chicano music resounding, this would have taken away the tension and Denis understood this clearly. Obviously Villeneuve is also greatly responsible for the visual merit of the movie. Prisoners does not rely on one aspect per se, it is a perfect collabo between those working in front of the camera and those behind it.The story. Obviously the story is the winner here. After Keller Gover (Hugh Jackman)'s daughter and her friend go missing, he realizes the police isn't helping much so he decides to act upon it himself. He does everything in his power to try to find his and Franklin's (Terrance Howard) daughter before they get in any real danger. As time passes and pressure builds, Keller finds himself in a difficult and depressive position in which he is forced to act violently in order to find out the truth about the disappearance of the two girls. His wife Grace (Maria Bello) falls into an emotional abyss and mental disconnection from reality as she copes with the tragic event. Keller is willing to do whatever it takes to save his missing girl, even if it involves acting like a maniac. The story is marvelously written by Aaron Guzikoswki whose work I'm definitely looking forward to seeing again. I particularly liked the way it unfolded on a steady pace, in synch with the protagonists' gradually degenerating psyche. The plot is not exactly perfect though, and I can't discuss the imperfections without spoiling it but what I can say is that there are a few plot holes here and there albeit generally harmless.The Acting. With a cast that is only too familiar with Oscar nominations and wins, it is hard not to get inadvertently involved with the characters they portray. Hugh Jackman (Academy & Golden Globe Awards for Les Mis\u00e9rables) gave probably the best performance of his career. The anger, confusion, sadness, depression, frustration..all brilliantly portrayed in such a perfect way that you're sure you would have done the same thing if put in his character's position. Often times we yell at people in the movies for doing the wrong or stupid thing and making dumb decisions but with Jackman, you relate to each word he says and decision he makes. I particularly liked the scene where Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) goes to Keller's house to tell him and his wife about the progress of the search for their daughter. Keller loses control and starts yelling angrily over this one, then apologizes for his aggressive behavior. Jackman nailed that part. But it's still nothing compared to what he delivers throughout the rest of the movie. This will surely remain a memorable performance, and I think I have a new favorite actor after Leonardo Dicaprio. Jake Gyllenhaal (BAFTA award & Academy award nomination for Brokeback Mountain) gave a remarkable performance as well playing the detective in the midst of this maddening case, caught between trying to find the missing girls and making sure the affected family doesn't cross borders and do something irresponsible. We manage to get under his skin and understand the fact that he chooses no sides, all he is doing and is keeping the law and making sure that things are done in accordance with it. Viola Davis (BAFTA, Academy and Golden Globe nomination for The Help) who plays Franklin's wife Nancy also as usual had an outstanding although brief screen presence. Terrence Howard (Academy Award nomination for Hustle & Flow) proved his true acting abilities and I'm sure he surprised many with his role as Franklin Birch. How painful it was to watch him portray his character. Of course not forgetting Maria Bello (Golden Globe award for The Cooler) who played Keller's devastated wife. All these and the rest of the unmentioned actors' performances were career-high, aside from Wayne Duval who plays dumb captain Richard O'Malley.This genuinely remains one of the few films to have affected me deep down, even though the feeling subsided a few hours later (that makes me sound like a fraud, I know ha ha). But this is not one of those sentimental movies that try too hard to get a tear out of the audience. The story is there, you just deal with your emotions. 8.1/10 is underrating to me, I give it a 9/10 and I swipe away 1 only because of the prodding belief that nothing is perfect. \"Prisoners\" is recommended for Everyone!",

I felt the characterisation could be better, the interactions were all pretty bleak after the feel good intro (if you've seen Twin Peaks, you'll know what I'm getting at, but it is a movie and not a show, so they had less time and I suppose didn't want to confuse the mood).I take a point off because from the introduction of the 'maze' obsessed character I started to think of a book, a book that terrified me and I would not read again. The underground maze reveal and the incessant torture of the lead husband also stank of this book. I wonder if the maze idea was plagiarised/inspired (and the plot totally reworked) by it or whether I'm just bringing my impression of this book to the film. Perhaps the idea comes from that mythological story about the maze and the Minotaur and has been reworked many times but until now I had only caught one.I read some other reviews but no one really commented on this that I saw. The ending is perfectly unnerving and directed my thought right into the obvious juxtaposition.This is the kind of movie I would recommend to a friend just to gauge them by their reaction.",

I refer to the ending so if you don't want to know come off now.Hugh Jackman's character is seen as a tough guy who can certainly handle himself,that is until he comes up against a little old lady in her kitchen. He then acts totally out of character and does exactly what she asks even though it is obvious that she is not going to let him live, and he won't rescue his daughter. In the kitchen he could have easily over powered her, OK she had a gun but so did he in his bag. Or when she gave him the drink to weaken him, what does he do? He drinks it rather than through it in her face.Then the most stupid part. He gets into a car and reverses slowly as she asks him to, rather than reversing quickly to knock her over or oat least off her feet. And then he jumps down a hole so she can lock him in with the car over it.Sorry but none of this makes sense and it spoilt an otherwise good film.I also thought that Jake Gyllenhaal was a poor choice for his role as a cop, he was clearly unhinged and hindered the investigation, (then maybe cops are like that?). Terence Howard's character was the only one I believed out of all the parents and Paul Dano plays his part well as the mentally backward son of the nutty woman. I also thought that the film had too much unnecessary bad language, (Then I always find that people swear and curse more in movies than I ever find in real life(, But I put up with it as the story was gripping until the end.It is a real shame that this film ended the way it did.

The mystery and confusion, you was really left wondering and asking a lot of questions and most of the time I was glued to my seat following the ongoing hunt.Jake Gyllenhaal did a great job portraying his character of a police detective who works tirelessly to complete his job. So it's definitely a big up for the best performance in his career in my opinion. A lot of people has complained and raised a lot of questions about the ending but don't be discouraged.

            "content": "As you saw in my title the script in this movie takes the main spotlight. The twists and turns, the dialogues and the right 'till the end top level suspense. All of those aspects are majorly improved by the amazing man sitting in the directors chair and the talented men acting it out in front of the camera. Especially the one and only Hugh Jackman who steals every single scene he is in. That doesn't by far mean the other actors aren't that good. Gyllenhaal and Terrence Howard both portray two desperate men perfectly. Now to the plot which puts you in this awful situation on which two girls get abducted. A detective (Gyllenhaal) is put in charge of the case while the father of one of the girls (Jackman) takes some extreme measures. I won't go further than that to not spoil you of anything awesome (which by the way tends to be the whole movie). Directing-wise this movie is just out there in space. By I literally don't remember looking away or blinking. I just sat there at the edge of my seat biting my fingers! The composition of the opening shot just gave me the chills. A still shot of some creepy snowy woods with a dear walking by, while Jackman spells out \"The holy father\" is beautifully unsettling. A lot of the shots are still shots. They don't shy away of lingering the shots. Props to that dude named Denis Villeneuve. I'll throw it out there that this movie made me cringe. It is disturbing **** The last thing I wanna point out is the ending. It has you on your knees by being a very quiet but intense scene full of some sweet sweet shots. In the end this movie tackled all of the aspects that make a thriller great and it will definitely get itself some of those Oscar noms! 10 out of 10 baby!",

            "content": "Prisoners may not contain jump scares, ghosts, screaming, things that go bump in the night or loads of fog but it is one of the scariest movies of 2013. This terrifying child abduction thriller is unbelievably chilling and once it has viewers in its raw, icy grip it never lets go. Hugh Jackman and Terence Howard are the 2 fathers whose daughters go missing and Jake Gyllenhaal's detective tries to find them. Both the fathers go to extreme lengths to find their children. The film goes into a lot of dark territory, and it has some very disturbing scenes. But it is genuinely, completely and undeniably brilliant. It's 2 and a half hour length was unnecessary and there are scenes which weren't needed. This doesn't blunt the film's impact overall though. The acting and cinematography make the movie. Roger Deakin's amazing cinematography and Denis Villeneuve's tense direction mean the film both looks amazing and is absolutely filled with dread. If you want to be on the edge of your seat for 2 and a half hours watch this. Trust me, you will be.Jake Gyllenhaal's performance is subtle but excellent, and Terence Howard is very good as well. Sadly, the memory of Hugh Jackman's amazing acting in this has been obscured since I saw Movie 43 only a few days after this, but it was a terrifying, powerful and skilled performance that didn't get the attention it deserved. The mystery element is compelling and you don't guess the murderer before the end. It's very well written and none of the dialogue feels forced. None of the emotional breakdowns or freak outs feel forced either. It is too long, but there's always stuff going on and the length does not damage the film. The thrills are based on the mystery and on suspense, but when there are thrilling moments they're very well handled and have you right on the edge of your seat. I think this should have been a contender for a best picture nod as it's a lot better than American Hustle, Dallas Buyers Club and Philomena. An excellent and overlooked film from 2013 that's definitely worth your time. If you want to see Hugh Jackman lose it this is the film for you.9/10",

The acting is okay, lots of mannerisms, especially from Gillenhall but he's a strong character actor and can pull it off. But the movie is full of unexplained moments and weak linking. The main characters do things without any apparent motivation. Red herrings are presented and then vanish without any explanation. The storyline is full of holes. The immorality of Jackman's character's behavior is a deep concern and this is then swept away by his being incarcerated and lost to his family without any relation to the ending. It's a frustrating film because it had the potential to be so much better but the inconclusive ending and dismissive resolution leaves one feeling cheated after sitting though two and a half hours of a very slowly built tension. The script should have been heavily edited before it went into production. I don't understand why the two lead actors agreed to make this movie. Neither of them can be short of job offers.",

I knew less than half way through the movie what was coming & whodunit. Unfortunately, this is a movie that Hollywood just couldn't keep their not so subtle liberal, leftist politics out of. This is set up in the very 1st scene where Hugh Jackman is out with his son shooting a poor Bambi like deer & again later when you see all the \"I'm ready for anything\" supplies in Hugh's basement. Hugh's character ends up pulling a totally foolish act that no logical, \"I'm ready for anything\" right winger would ever do. I don't think any liberal capable of thought would have done what Hugh ends up doing either. No, I'm not talking about torturing the young man. The resolution to that even turns out liberal.

First of all, you have to love the name Loki, as in low-key; which he is kind of the antithesis of. Maybe he is not as outwardly animated as Jackman's character, but you can see tons of rage. Anyway back my my real point/question... First of all, he never drinks. We never see him take a sip of alcohol. When the police chief offers him the whiskey at the end, he immediately dismisses it. Could this be nothing, sure. Could it be something, perhaps. Cops are notorious for being drinkers, as even a little reference from shutter island will support: Teddy Daniels: Soda on ice please, thanks.Dr. Jeremiah Naehring:Oh, you don't indulge in alcohol I'm surprised. Isn't it common for men in your profession to imbibe?Also, the reason why this stands out to me so much is because there is also one scene where I believe Jackman's wife asks the detective if he has kids. He never answers the question. He defers to some generic line like \"we will find your girl\" but thats not before hesitating for a second. Maybe I'm thinking too much into this; but the hesitation and look on his face struck me. Is there a connection to his hesitation to this question about him having kids, his refusal to drink alcohol, and the reason why he solves child disappearances for a living? Who am I to say. But these are things that struck me and things I think about. My $0.02",

There's also some awkward confusion over the initial suspect's arrest: he's held and then released, he's conveniently catatonic in the police station but mutters something odd to the angry father out in the parking lot, he can't pass a lie detector test without understanding the questions yet he has a driver's license. There's also some fudging by screenwriter Aaron Guzikowski, who would rather toss in trunks full of snakes and mazes on the walls then tell us how some crazy acting man managed to get two rambunctious little girls into his camper. One Oscar nomination: for Roger Deakins' cinematography. **1/2 from ****",

            "content": "This movie is slow paced and there are many slow long drawn out scenes. the movie would benefit if it moved faster and had different shots & angles and possibly even music in different scenes. personally i feel overall this movie was poorly constructed and would have been much better if worked on by a team of different professionals.this movie lacks some realism. this movies version of realistic scenes is....so holly-woodish and fake. i mean certain scenes seem to me as an avid-movie buff to be.....as real looking as a fake apple is to hold and touch. and the dialogue and decisions of the characters and their character-build are as sharp as a polished marble.some things i didn't like: i didn't like the African American actor who played one of the fathers in this movie. i don't like the way he looks, sounds, or that he couldn't play his instrument in the beginning, and i don't like his comments. i would have preferred him to be someone else with different dialogue, and directions. i don't like how the detective in this movie looks like a frickin ex-con prisoner. when i first saw him i thought he was the antagonist/bad-guy. the detective was made to look this way cause some fool in the production crew thought this was the hot-guy look teens go for and maybe her personal preference for men so she (or he?) made this character look this certain ex-con fashionable way. to me his look and the things he says and does is totally unprofessional. I didn't like how the detective talks to his boss (captain) with disrespect and disdain in his voice as if he is superior to him- the the captain hearing and witnessing this disrespect allowed it and seemed incompetent. this to me seems entirely unresearched and fabricated. in other words it's unrealistic. if a detective talks to his commanding officer in any agency in any town the way this fellow does in this movie he would be looking for a new job quick. yet im supposed to buy that this hipster cool detective can get away with this? why? and his captain is some loser behind a desk? is this a comedy? no. its just badly written because it's unrealistic.Anyway...the detective is supposed to be some genius of a guy who has solved all six of his cases and the actor who plays him does as good of a job as he can with poor dialogue and direction but unfortunately its not enough to save his poorly constructed decisions. what i mean is- this actor does what he is told to do- and he is told to do some dumb things by the director/writer. otherwise i have no problem with the way he looks or talks to his captain. what i mean is- he is SUPPOSED to be a genius detective but what he actually does and says in this movie opposes his role as a genius because there is nothing highly intelligent about discussing astrological signs in his opening scene, being disrespectful to his boss, and disregarding rules and doing things by the book. nothing he does is really special at all is what i mean.....he has this higher than thou attitude but what we see him do in the movie is new yorker-ish in the bad attitude sense and is common! so he is written and introduced by another character as being \"special\" but he does nothing special! His actions are rudimentary and unprofessional- that is why i say this movie is poorly constructed and poorly researched!This movie reminds me of some South Korean thriller movies but are not as fast paced and fun to watch as them. I recommend you watch The Chaser and I Saw the Devil if you liked this junky movie.The things I liked about this movie: The main characters Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal have great acting skills and presence in this movie. they are likable fellows and i enjoy seeing them in this movie and have an affection for them because of other movies i have seen them in. they practically save this poorly structured and poorly written movie. without them this movie would appear on Lifetime channel as a TV movie as it is poorly made like one.",

And then instead of ending where it should have and throwing in the culminating scenes all together they drag it out some more and try to be clever with an open ending roll credits moment where you sit there for a second in disbelief than they could have the audacity to do that to viewers..

            "review_title": "Lost In the Maze",
            "content": "The sleepy town of Conyers, Pennsylvania is transformed into a cold, bleak world submerged in misery in Denis Villeneuve's dark crime thriller \"Prisoners,\" released on DVD and Blu-ray on December 17th. The film entrenches viewers in a maze of hazy moral boundaries and pushes the limits of desperation in its characters, made up by an all-star line-up of accomplished actors. Rife with obscure religious symbolism and cryptic reoccurring motifs, the tangled mystery of Prisoners gives enough substance to satisfy but leaves enough unanswered questions to tantalize, reaching a Goldilocks-like equilibrium for a whodunit film.Hugh Jackman plays the rugged God-fearing survivalist Keller Dover, who is thrust to the brink of despair when his daughter and her best friend disappear on Thanksgiving Day, despite his obsessive precautions and preparations for the worst. Dover's helpless desperation drives him to kidnap and brutally torture the main suspect in the case who was released, the unnervingly enigmatic Alex Jones (Paul Dano). Jake Ghyllenhaal plays the suave and poised Detective Loki heading the case, whose analytical investigation is the counterpart to Dover's vigilante revenge, resulting in explosive scenes on screen when the two alpha males face off, like \"the cowboy versus the sheriff,\" according to Villeneuve.Unlike Liam Neeson's over-the-top ass-kicking in Taken, Jackman's portrayal as the unstable grieving father is believable and heartbreaking: his rampant violent rages convey a bottomless sadness just under the surface threatening to consume him, and one scene in particular one-on-one with Ghyllenhaal shows the actor's immense ability to bare a character's soul with utter conviction. The grisly torture scenes prove cringe-worthy, but Jackman is stellar at toeing the line between keeping viewers' confidence or losing it altogether with his frightening, ugly, yet all-too-human performance. Whether Dover is a monster or a martyr is left up to the viewers.Detective Loki's character doesn't achieve the same depths as Dover or even Jones: little character development and back-story in the script leaves Loki hanging as a blank slate, but Ghyllenhaal compensates with spot-on character tics and a reassuring composure on screen. His character's stylish wardrobe, sleek hairstyle, and mysterious zodiac-like tattoos make him a more visually stimulating figure than the no-nonsense Dover, adding another dimension to the character, if only aesthetically.Supporting actors Terrence Howard and Viola Davis anchor the film as the Birchs, the neighbors whose daughter also goes missing. Their refusal to condone Dover's actions help keep the film grounded as realistic, and Howard's performance as the broken father paralyzed by grief is a welcome contrast to the crusading Dover. The viewpoints of the older siblings in the story however, along with Dover's wife, are sidelined in favor of pushing the plot forward with Dover's grappling with morality and Loki's determined search for answers. Melissa Leo and Paul Dano are highly memorable in their supporting roles as Holly and Alex Jones: the two are adept at keeping their characters in the neutral zone of suspicion, a difficult place to remain for long in a mystery film.Composer J\u00c3\u00b3hann J\u00c3\u00b3hannsson's brooding score exemplifies the film's weariness and growing tension, keeping the pressure simmering throughout and only surging in release for the film's climax with the song \"Through Falling Snow.\" Cinematographer Roger Deakins beautifully composes every frame, and doesn't shy away from peering through opaque filters of rain-soaked windows and shadows in the noir tradition. He often uses an expressionistic icy color temperature laced with deep blacks to manifest the characters' isolation and dread.As his first Hollywood (and English-language) film, Villeneuve has earned his place among the Hollywood elite with the star-studded thriller Prisoners. While the film may be too hard to digest for some, fleshing out every parent's nightmare for a nerve-wracking two and a half hours, it is an overall worthwhile captivating experience, with moving performances and a compelling mystery. This is one maze you'll love to get lost in.",

That touched off a frantic chain of events and sent two sets of parents into a tailspin. Franklin and Nancy Birch (Terrence Howard and Viola Davis) tried their best to keep it together. Grace Dover (Maria Bello) resorted to pills while Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) resorted to violence. The only clue anyone had was a beat up old RV that was parked in the street earlier that day. They found the driver of the RV, Alex Jones (Paul Dano), but he was totally clean. Keller could not accept that as being true.Det. Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) was the head detective on the case. He had to look for the girls as well as keep an eye on Keller as he was unhinged. The entire two-and-a-half hour movie we're just hoping the children are alive and will be found. That feeling only intensifies as the movie progresses. At the same time \"Prisoners\" throws a curve ball at the viewers by showing Keller and how violent he has become. It's an emotional bleep that keeps your stomach twisted in knots.Hulu.",

It's not, it's a thriller. I'm not going to say anything about the plot, only that I didn't find it very satisfactory and I didn't feel everything \"fell into place\" at the end (actually, I'm not sure I understand what were the parts of all the people involved and what the point of the movie was). Also, I think the writer had some influence from The Vanishing. It felt like a mish-mash of ideas from several thriller movies.Good acting by the entire cast, especially Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal and Paul Dano (even Terrence Howard was bearable; and man, Maria Bello got old! She looks at least in her 50's), good low-key score by Johann Johannsson.

It is an engrossing& harrowing story of a father & detective taking different roads to find two abducted children. A seemingly generic plot on the surface is infused with such bone-chilling tension, dread, and artistic strokes that it eventually becomes a different beast altogether.The father is Hugh Jackman, who delivers a scorcher of a performance! Take away Wolverine's claws & replace it with raw emotional weight and you have Jackman's character Keller Dover. Jake Gyllenhaal is also incredibly impressive playing a character struggling between his procedural job & natural instincts. Terrance Howard, Viola Davis, & Paul Dano also put in excellent performances in their respective supporting roles.The movie, a long procedural hearkens back to Fincher's murder mysteries. In fact, given the pace, narrative quality, & sharp editing one could be excused for mistaking it as such. That is a well-earned compliment for the director Denis Villeneuve. Although in a different context when compared to Seven, the film possesses a layer of religious insinuation that adds interest to the story-structure.The film proudly shows off Roger Deakins cinematography in what may be his best work considering that this is not a spectacle movie or one shot in some iconic location. His skills elevate the production with gorgeous lighting & camera-angles. It is a technical aspect many will overlook in the dreary setting of the story, but is major strength of the film. Nowhere is it punctuated better than in a brief night-time driving sequence towards the end of the film.Overall, Prisoners is a dramatic & nerve-grinding thriller of the highest order. It is a slow-burn drama that is a fitting companion-piece to films like Seven & Zodiac.",

The fall movie season is officially underway, and couldn't be more welcome. After a disappointing summer movie season for the most part, it is easy to tell based on the previews alone before the film that the next few months will bring no lack of great movies. Okay, back to this one. I have been looking forward to this one for a while. Not that I enjoy the situation the main characters will be put into, probably more because it is at times thought provoking to think about what would you do if you were put into a situation, or a revenge or vigilante situation in which you felt the law failed you.The previews for this movie did a great job, because \u00be through this movie, I still had no idea what was going to happen or who the abductor of the children was. The director does such a great job with building the mystery and the revelations and foreshadowing that it's just not possible to figure it out. There are clues of course but to figure the whole puzzle out, well, it's pretty impossible, and that's part of the reason this movie is so great. It is definitely emotionally taxing. My wife did not want to watch the movie, and with good reason. In the film \"Ransom\" Mel Gibson is on a manhunt for his child's kidnappers and is in communication with them. The audience also gets glimpses of the child occasionally and knows that while not in an ideal situation, he is okay. In this movie, the audience does not get many revelations. The children are gone, and that's all we know. We don't know how, who, why, or where. It's difficult to explain much more without giving anything way, and I'm not going to do that. While this movie is NOT a feel good movie or a pick me up, it is superb, and for the most part, with the emotional trip.",

            "content": "In my opinion Prisoners one of the best movies of 2013 if not the best. It opens on 2 family's getting together to have a fun night. But that is quickly ruined when the little girls from both families are missing. And it proceeds to weave a dark, intelligent look at what people will do to get the ones they love back. The cast is superb all receiving their share of character development and making you feel as if you are apart of these families and experiencing what they are going through. Prisoners mainly follows Hugh jackman and jake Gyllenhaal. Hugh jackman, the father of one of the missing girls doing everything to get his daughter back from stakeouts to torture. And Gyllenhaal the stone cold detective assigned to the kidnapping case. Putting on display Gyllenhaals uncanny ability it inhabit this character and bring a level of humanity that you don't see in your average film.Both have impressive performances. Specifically Hugh Jackman. Taking a step away from Wolverine is refreshing and puts on display his acting range. Serving as a reminder that he is more then just a guy with side burns. The scenes were he is torturing a possible suspect for information are not only hard to watch but surprisingly emotional. Maybe a little extreme but really putting in perspective how far you may be willing to go for the people you love. But They are brutal scenes and are not for the faint of heart. Prisoners also is able to deliver a great plot twist as well. Not just one either. The whole film feels like are constantly on a roller coaster ride. But Just when it feels like the ending is gonna go all Hollywood and mushy on you it takes a dark turn. Not saying that this movie isn't dark already but this really takes a turn. Trust me. Overall Prisoners is brilliantly well crafted thriller chalk full of tense sequences, Fantastic performances, and a feeling of humanity you don't get in other movies.",

I seldom put spoilers in reviews but this film is complex and I must bring up the turn of events. As far as acting goes this is Jake Gyllenhaal's film. He is excellent throughout and the most human person in the film. His character is certainly who I identified with. Jake Gyllenhaal's acting progressed and was superior in the last part of the film.This is certainly not a liberal film and not conservative either. The ending was clear and I do not see any ambiguousness in the ending either. It was obvious what was happening in the last 30 seconds. Further even the small comment early in the film about being against deer hunting when we sit around eating hamburgers at McDonald's with industrialized slaughter to feed millions is absolutely a good point about society's hypocrisy. But I don't want to deviate from the plot. This was just one tiny early sentence in the film.I do believe the film could have been just as good with a little less brutality. I am especially referring to the water part which was not needed. In the middle I wasn't sure if I would like the film. But ultimately I would say it was a top film. The acting and the story was fine. The religious angle actually changed as the film played out. Now for a major spoiler. Who would ever believe that the priest may actually have been correct? Was this a war against God? I will say no more about that. Ultimately, this film could not be entirely judged to be dark. Certainly the cop was intense and believable. There was some deserved justice delivered even for the brutality. Although the legal penalties were not reached and i will leave that vague. The final 10 minutes was riveting. And even some fast car scenes were very effective because of the depth of the plot. i have tried to be somewhat vague for those who have not yet seen the film. And the ending was very clear to me.",

This film is masterfully well done in every way; from the directing, writing, acting, sound design, cinematography on down to the editing. Trust me when I say, it's a film with very few noticeable flaws. Hugh Jackman gives an insanely good performance as the father desperately searching for his daughter. Jake G honestly wasn't as stellar as Hugh, but his character was that of a calm detective trying to find the kidnapped girls. I wouldn't say he phoned it in, because his character had noticeable ticks and mannerisms that remained consistent throughout the movie. In my opinion, it's just hard not to see Jake G instead of his character like he transformed in both Nightcrawler and Southpaw. But still good acting all around. Can't forget Paul Dano and David Dastmalchain, both did stellar work. The cinematography... it's done by Roger Deakins so yeah, it's phenomenal. Denis Villeneuve proves to be a directing we all should be on the look out for in the many years to come. The writing, done by Andy Guzikowski is great. It surprises me that this isn't based on a book judging by how deep the plot goes with mystery and \"mazes\". This guy is one damn good mystery/crime writer. Basically, to sum it all up. SEE THIS MOVIE THE FIRST CHANCE YOU GET! It's not good, it's great.",

Maybe the dramatic overload of a developing kidnapping is the great hook for sustain the tension and interest for so much time. However I think the performances, the unexpected, help. I think an interesting thing is the way the characters acquire and manage information. The dosage of information seems carefully designed. The detective, the captain, the reaction of Mr Dover, etc, are far from clich\u00e9s. I've experienced how the characters were confused and desperate like me, and that was possible (I think) thanks to the way the movie deliver information.

I moseyed in about two-thirds the way through the film, when Hugh Jackman's wielding a claw hammer and quivering with fury.\"What the hell are we watching?\" my Dad asked from the edge of his seat.\"Yeah I know, it's great, right!\"Love that sink scene. Think about how the theme of imprisonment relates to each character. How informed each party is, and in turn, the motivations that result.Just from that little suggestion, you can tell you're in for a quality picture.For those who haven't seen Prisoners: If you like great movies see this film.Here's what 'great' means. It means 'great enough.' If you leave Prisoners feeling genuine hatred, you're being overly critical.So check it out, but be careful of the spoilers below.Hugh Jackman may be the best actor currently working in Hollywood. I'm biased because he's been my number one favorite since X-Men (2000), but my dude's quickly climbing the charts. He's so prolific nowadays.I've seen most his catalogue (except for Australia) and I stand by Swordfish and Van Helsing as great movies. I'll argue to the death for either. I have no idea why their Rotten Tomatoes percentages are in the twenties. Baffles me, truly.Anyway, my point is, Hugh Jackman delivers a spectacular performance as Keller Dover in this film. Keller's a wildly compelling character with complex motivations.Further acting prowess is displayed by his character's wife, Gracie Dover, played by Maria Bello, who steers a powerful teary-eyed scene.Viola Davis plays Nancy Birch, and also carries a tense scene without muttering a word of dialogue. She just delivers a long, dead stare.Terrence Howard's not my favorite, but he does a decent enough job here. I suppose I avoid giving him too much credit because I've heard some not so nice things about him.He's the second actor credited for Iron Man, after R.D.J. himself. And he was replaced by another black actor, Don Cheadle, after demanding too much money for the second installment in the series.I didn't even notice until well after 3.Jake Gyllenhaal as Detective Loki has a wildly compelling discussion with a priest, and ties together the film in a pleasing way. Jake's rather talented, I feel like I don't see enough of him.Detective Loki's shirt is always buttoned to his chin but he's never wearing a tie, which drove me nuts until someone pointed out the tattoo on his neck. The only plot hole is the scene in which Gyllenhaal opens the trunks full of snakes. His character isn't the type to leave the lids ajar, allowing the serpents' escape.Before moving on, I must mention that David Dastmalchian delivers as a more capable deranged man than the role he plays in The Dark Knight. He's a solid actor, and I bet we'll see more from him in the future.Lot of powerful gazing goes on in this film. From Viola D.'s deadpan, to the stare-down between Jake and Paul Dano, you get some strong gawks. When Dano signs his release from prison, it gives me the chills.By the way, P.D.'s phenomenal in this film. So creepy. The dog-walking scene'll make your spine crawl.An easily avoidable thought to take away from Prisoners is that Paul Dano's character is, ultimately, the worst victim of all.But that's a reality on which I'd prefer not to dwell.",

A psychologically harrowing and almost disturbing story that takes advantage of the balanced and well played actors performance. A special mention to the stunning symmetrical evolution of the main actors characters played by Jackman and Gyllenhaal. The director gives us the free choice to pick up our character side, which evolves with the complexity of the situations. This leads to a constant questioning about the right and bad way to solve the case. I just regret that the intrigue lacks a bit of pace. Overall a great movie in the pure line of 'mystic river' and 'Zodiac'.",

This has as a result to make the movie even more interesting and along with the direction which was made by Denis Villeneuve and it was equally good, created the mystery behind the missing girl. The interpretations of both Hugh Jackman who played as Keller Dover and Jake Gyllenhaal who played as Detective Loki were simply amazing and their combination worked very well.

The characters are developed brilliantly and you feel a strong amount of empathy for pretty much all of the characters and have sympathy for the situation they are in. The film also has a very unapologetic tone, there is one aspect of the film which may even verge on disturbing but this only adds to the plot and character development. Have I mentioned already about how beautiful this film is, it feels like you are watching the work of someone who sat developing the set for each scene for days on end, the film also includes a one minute sequence which is one of the most beautiful set pieces ever, easily up there with the cola cabana steady cam in Goodfellas and the steady cam behind the trike in The Shining.

If you have been very much fond of watching thrillers having subplots, twist inside twist and Multiple stories running on parallel path then Prisoners is not one of them. Otherwise, Prisoners is a fantastic single plot thriller with enough thrills and suspense around it. The problem could be it doesn't go away from it's single plot and doesn't offer anything beyond that which makes it little bit predictable and light weighted. One more thing to notice is the film did not try to become intelligent at all despite the fact there were many things in screenplay which could have been used cleverly to set this up high. May be I feel so because i have seen many thrillers with mind boggling twists and multiple planning theories involved in them but i guess we deserve such films in modern era otherwise we have many great thrillers made 7-8 decades ago. Anyways, talking about this one, it's just a simple story of child kidnapping racket but heavy and strain atmosphere makes it very intriguing. Unfortunately it comes with some contradictions and humdrum linear equation but still somehow manages to hold till the end. That's what the best part is. An ordinary scenario keeping it up and tight till the end, yes very much succesful case. Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal are the saving pillars in the acting, cinematography is decent, dialogues are so-so and the background score is better than expected. Director Denis Villeneuve's first English language film is winner as a whole but not comprehensive. The conviction of the subject and the crafting needed touch of clever work. It doesn't disappoint much though, and surely makes a Gripping Fantastic watch despite slow pace. Overall, Prisoners delivers everything what you can get from any One-Line Thriller.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest",

            "content": "Prisoners is one of these films that will make you spend 2 hours and then surprise you in the last 30 minutes. A great film that has great acting performances, cinematography, directing, screenplay, and everything.Prisoners really surprised me with everything. Didn't expect the film to go to where it's going. Its story is so great and I believe that's thanks to the build-up that took 2 hours. Although it's a long time. But, in the end, it will all make sense and the pieces are all put together perfectly. Every film is famous for a specific scene but it's hard to find one in this film because there are so many so it's hard to pick. I'll be honest, at the first, I didn't like that the film was taking too much time to tell the story and it was giving us one piece after the other but at the end, we were able to put all of them together and it gave us a masterpiece.I believe that this is Jake Gyllenhaal's second-best performance (Nightcrawler being the first). He was able to present Detective Loki in such a unique way that only Jake himself is able to play. For those who don't know, Detective Loki's tattoos, rings, and rapid blinking were all Jake Gyllenhaal's ideas. I believe that the rings and the tattoos have meanings behind them which makes Detective Loki an interesting character that we all want to know more about. Now for Hughe Jackman, I believe that this is his best performance even better than Wolverine. In many scenes, you could feel his pain as a father who lost his daughter especially in those scenes where he was screaming and yelling at the top of his lungs. You can feel the pain in his voice. Overall, the acting in this film is ON POINT.Denis Villeneuve's way of directing this film is very unique. He was able to give us drama, Thriller, Crime, and many more using his directing and the little small details that you might think don't matter but they all will at the end. Roger Deakins with his great cinematography/camera movements were beautiful, the film really has many shots that are beautiful. Also, the colors and the editing really helped to give the audience that thriller/crime vibe.Overall, this film has everything. Acting, cinematography, editing, directing, and even the music/soundtrack may be the most part that many didn't notice. But, in some scenes, you could hear the beautiful soundtrack of J\u00f3hann J\u00f3hannsson playing in the background and giving you that suspense/thriller feel. Great film that the more you get deep into it and notice the little details, the more you like it.My rating is 9/10.",

            "content": "There is no doubt that the biggest nightmare for a parent is to see a child die, especially if it is the result of a criminal's perfidious mind. But I don't know how much better the abduction of a child is: it is not known if the child is alive or dead, what happened to him, if he is all right, and all the uncertainty has the effect, on a father, of a real Chinese torture. This film tells us about that, and the moral boundaries and barriers that a father is willing to break in order to get her daughter back.The script is extraordinarily good, intense and morally challenging. I don't think it's possible to remain indifferent to such a dramatic story: while the police do what they can to locate Keller Dover's missing daughter, the desperate father decides to act on his own and arrest, and even torture, the one he senses to be the culprit, even though he has no proof of that and know that he are committing a crime by doing so. Meanwhile, a police detective continues to investigate, and goes looking for other possible suspects.The film features two great performances by two renowned actors: Jake Gyllenhaal and Hugh Jackman. The two give us powerful performances, and the way they both perform is impeccable, stealing our attention whenever they show up. In addition to this duo of actors, the film also features good appearances by Maria Bello, Viola Davis, Paul Dano and Terrence Howard. And in fact, we cannot say that any of them looked bad. All were well and up to what was asked of them.Technically, it's a low-key film that lets us be fully aware of the story that will be told, as well as the excellent performance of the cast. Many of the film's scenes are at night, and night shooting can be challenging, but the cinematography is very good and made very clever use of darkness, shadows and spotlights to intensify the tense atmosphere that the film builds. The filming locations, sets and costumes also make a good contribution to the construction of the global panorama and the environment, without jarring notes worthy of mention. The visual and sound effects worked well, but maybe a little more soundtrack is missing, punctually.",

Denis Villeneuve has made yet an other excellent motion picture such as \"Incendies\"!

The acting performances are very extreme which befits the central dilemma of the film, asking what is justified when children's lives are hanging in the balance and what kind of demons are lurking in us all. It's an 8.5/10 from me, with some reservations due to certain plot contrivances.",

Not just that the camera is always very well placed, but the dialogs, the actions taken and the personalities of the characters are very realistic.Even if the plot is an of the more \"common\" ones, the making of the movie gives it something almost unique. The suspense is lasting till the last minute and often you have for yourself to think about moral decisions and a character that you liked in the beginning may become unfriendly to you as the movies goes on.One of the best part of the movie is the very last scene - it's so well done that I had to give it a 10/10 rating, even if I have to admit that I enjoyed The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo a liiiitle bit much more.Thanks for that great movie that proves that they are still good directors out there making good movies and not things like X MEN number 10000000.GREAT WORK!",

You can see there's no flaw that make you doubt or question everything that happens, every actions the characters take has a reason and it makes exciting to bring shocking \"reality\" scenes when someone is under pressure.Spoiler content: I also think the end of the movie was really nice. We don't know if Keller Dover would be rescued from the trap. As he took good and bad actions throughout the movie, actions that would split viewers' opinions, then the denouement belongs to the viewers themselves.In my opinion, the only part that should have been more explored was the life of the boys who were tortured, but mistaken as criminals, such as the whole maze thing.",

Amazing acting by everybody from face expressions to creating the atmosphere. If I had to rate this movie only for acting, I would've given it 10/10.But there are more things I need to consider before rating it. There were few things in the movie that didn't really made any sense to me. For example, the detective goes alone to confront somebody. Police doesn't works like that. They always go in groups because there is always a chance of combat. Even when the father ran away from the hospital infront of detective's eyes, he went alone after him. Similarly, the cops aren't really focused to find the missing boy whom the fathers of the girls kidnapped. They also didn't tell us how did they found Joy and what happened to the father after the detective hears the whistle sound (the ending scene). Did they saved him or not?I admit they can't make everything \"which makes sense\" in movies but this movie is one of the bests. It's ranked #201 in the world and I've to say it's a little overrated. But this movie is still good, worth a watch definitely. I'm not calling it a bad movie either.",

This is a tough but rewarding film to sit through and the pacing is good- you will be transfixed throughout. The acting is superb and everyone from Terence Howard and Jake Gyllenhaal to Paul Dano and Melissa Holly shine, but the star act is Jackman who should have received more accolades for his turn as the distraught father in this movie.

Hugh Jackman plays a totally irrational man, I mean REALLY irrational, a total lunatic. No one behaves like that. Except in movies. I've probably watched every episode of First 48 and not one single time did a family member take the law into their own hands. Nor risk everything for himself or his family. A total irrational lunatic. It might sound weird, but I had ZERO sympathy for Jackman.Stop writing implausible scripts. No cop just breaks into several houses without a warrant. Nor do they investigate a murder/crime by themselves. Nor do they slam or beat up people in custody. Just does NOT happen. It is so annoying. No cop behaves like that. He would have been suspended in a second or fired. Cops don't yell at each other. It was pure fantasy. And no matter what, Gyllenhaal kept doing chases, investigations, break-ins, etc all by himself.

Prisoners is not a tremendous departure for Villeneuve, who has until now built a career upon these kinds of brainy, Fincher-like thrillers, but it works, mostly because the director was able to coax two very coiled and believable performances from his two leading men (Gyllenhaal delivers one of the best and strangest performances of his career).

The movie is long, and a lot of scenes were unnecessary and gruesome. I fast- forwarded through the film at an hour and 45 minutes because I couldn't watch the boy getting tortured anymore. I was NEVER convinced that kid had anything do with the girls going missing, just because his RV was parked there. No cop would, only a dumb vigilante. I am certain one's emotions can take the better of them when their child goes missing, but kidnapping and torturing someone who could be innocent makes you no less guilty than the kidnapper/kidnappers themselves. It's one thing too loose reason, but the father lost his conscience and became no different than a sociopath. The kid was brutalized days in and days out, and no one does anything through the whole movie. I had to fast forward it to the part when the boy is finally saved. I stopped caring about the girls and cared more about the boy because you don't see the girls at all, only the poor boy being tortured by sociopath fathers.This could have been a good movie, but instead was a total mess. It was too long, half an hour of just watching a boy get tortured over and over again, while no one is out looking for him because the police are busy looking for the two missing girls. The fathers are no better than the kidnapper, they are torturing this kid for days because they are sure he's responsible for the girls going missing. You don't see the girls at all in the movie. The movie also has no ending, I am guessing because the father is going to jail once he is found. This is the worst movie ever!Most of the movie is about torture involving an adult man, nothing to do with kids. The adult men himself is a victim of kidnapping as a child and then again an adult by two vigilant fathers. Waste of time. Just dreadful!",

We highly recommend it based on its overall enjoyability as a movie that provides expected chills along with personal moral questions when you put yourself into the hero's shoes. The beginning of the movie has a palpable sense that something bad is about to happen. It's a similar feeling that you get at the beginning of many horror movies where the characters are introduced as carefree friends through the use of pointless, mundane chatter and laughter. But once the girls disappear, it's on! Any of you who are parents, as we are, can instantly relate to that lightning strike of fear that shoots through you when you realize you don't know where you kid is. That tenseness remains with you through most of the movie as they try to unravel the circumstances around the disappearance. Jake Gyllenhaal does an adequate job as the plodding yet persistent investigator, Detective Loki. The audience will be put into a balancing act of rooting for Loki to find the abductor, and hating Loki for not laying down the law while we sympathize with the victim's father Keller Dover, played convincingly by Hugh Jackman. It's really the character of Dover that will have the audience gut-wrenched as they try to decide if they would take the law into their own hands as Dover does when, as often happens, the law lets the accused out of jail. While Loki partially redeems himself by finally getting tough with the suspects and finding his way to the abductor, he still loses points for allowing one suspect to commit suicide before he can get an answer out of him and allowing Dover to beat him to the crime scene. The Dover character lets us down by torturing the wrong suspect and by letting himself be captured at the end. So, neither main character fully rewards the audience. But the biggest letdown was the revelation of the old church lady that broke bad and started killing kids after losing her own son many years prior. It was an, \"Uh, really?\" moment for the audience. But despite these few flaws, the movie manages to hold the audience captive and deliver the punches expected of a knockout thriller. See it!",

Prisoners is a movie about two girls that go missing and follows Jake Gyllenhaal, a detective who is tasked with tracking down the girls and Hugh Jackman, the father of one of the girls with a \"Pray for the best, prepare for the worst\" attitude. The two leads are exceptional as well as most of the supporting actors, specifically Paul Dano. Roger Deakins also killed it as the cinematographer. While it isn't as flashy as his other movies like 1917 or Blade Runner, each shot is rich with character and really makes you feel the hopelessness the leads feel. The last thing I want to rant about is the dialogue. While this film is nearly 2.5 hours long and contains very limited action, it never felt boring to me and is one of those movies where I get excited when two character talk to eachother because the script is so riveting. I cannot recommend this movie enough. While it can be depressing at times, give it a shot. The movie just flies by and if it was longer, I would not be opposed. 10/10.",

            "content": "Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) is a working class family man with a loving wife (Maria Bello), teenage son, and six-year-old daughter. On Thanksgiving, while at their friends' (Terrence Howard and Viola Davis) house, Dover's daughter Anna, and her friend, Joy, go out to play. They never come back. After a police search, Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) arrests a disturbed man, Alex Jones (Paul Dano), for the kidnapping. After Jones is released with no charges, Dover kidnaps him to get his own answers, using any means necessary before time runs out.Dover isn't a man yielding some unknown fighting skills that he whips out on bad guys to get answers throughout the course of the movie. This isn't that type of film. He's simply a broken, desperate father in search of his daughter. He doesn't sleep, or even really blink, while the circles under his eyes become just as dark as the narrative. \"Prisoners\" is both parts a gritty detective story and vigilante thriller, and it works on both levels. The performances here, especially Jackman and a chilling Dano, elevate this to one of the better ensembles of the year. The cinematography by Roger Deakins and Director Denis Villeneuve shows a quiet, isolated small-town (constantly drenched in rain since the girls' disappearance) that makes all the unveiling of secrets that much more unnerving.Perhaps \"Prisoners\" most valuable asset is the question it asks audiences: How far will you go for your family's protection? While Jackman's Dover will go to increasingly violent lengths to find his daughter, Franklin Birch (Terrence Howard) represents the other side of the moral coin. Birch pleas to him to leave it to the police to investigate the disappearance of their daughters. Are you a better parent if you sit back and wait or take the law into your own hands? While audience members may root for Dover as he carries out his vigilante investigation, they may soon see the kind of toll it can take on a person to commit such violence.\"Prisoners\" is an engrossing mystery that will stay with you days after viewing it. The film isn't built around a \"twist\" ending; half way through you may know where it is heading, but it doesn't take away from the excitement or tension of watching it all unfold. The moral issues raised in the film about family, religion, and the law, make this more than just an entertainment experience. Once the credits roll, it will make you look at yourself\u2014especially if you have children\u2014in a different light.",

Hugh Jackman gives what might be his greatest performance, and Jake Gyllenhaal turns in the best performance of the film, playing the films most important and interesting character. Prisoners is thought-provoking and really makes people question their moral boundaries. How far would you go realistically? But what drove Prisoners home, was its honesty. It refused to go the easy route also known as Hollywood. The first half is a slow and steady build-up that adds the realism of the situation. The second half is mystery heavy and unbelievably interesting. A film has not been this involving in a long time, especially with the mystery genre. Denis Villeneuve completely breaks- out and is for sure a director to keep an eye on. Also the most beautiful cinematography of the year. (Gravity had great cinematography, but with Earth as a background a lot, it is almost unfair) It is my favorite cinematography because Roger Deakins was able to use such simple and plain locations and used them perfectly, composing impeccable imagery. Prisoners also highly deserves a best original screenplay nomination as well as other things. The score set the tone and was darkly fascinating. Favorite film of 2013",

Superlative performances from Hugh Jackman (one of his best till date) and Jake Gyllenhaal. A story of a father who goes too far, goes too down, relinquishes all the values and morals in order to find out his possibly abducted daughter and a detective who commits himself onto his pursuit to find the same missing girl. At the end it is we who end up make ourselves the prisoner. It is we who get trapped out of a self-righteous crime. Denis Villeneuve's inch-perfect measure of storyline development, character moulding, Deakin's master cinematography and brilliance from Hugh and Jake are just too powerful to ignore what the film wants to convey.

It is the difference between a good horror film such as Ringu and a slasher title such as Scream.I can't help but feel that there was a change in script because the abrupt does not really deliver its intended impact. If you have watched the film then you will understand what I mean. I would not be surprised if there was an alternative ending in the DVD release.I did not give it a perfect 10/10 purely because the ideas were not original.

            "review_title": "Could have been good - and turns into a complete failure",
            "content": "\"Prisoners\" might be the best example for a movie, that could have been really good, but then fails in every single way and leaves you behind with a mix of anger, irritation and sheer disappointment. What could have been a good movie with interesting ideas, great actors and difficult moral questions turns into a boring and annoying peace of Hollywood-average-garbage by trying to satisfy a Hollywood-average-audience, who expect every story to turn into a fluffy fairy tale with simple answers, happy endings and the destruction of evil... All proceedings after the first half of the movie are so forced and stupid and inconsistent with the whole storyline, they just lead you to face palm yourself again and again and again.What did upset me the most - beside the incredible incompetence of the on-screen-police and the fact that no one in the movie seems to give a sh** about the fate of Alex and Bob, who were victims just like the two girls - were the following points:1) Both Keller and Detective Loki try to reach their goal by using brute force without searching for alternatives.\u00b0Real-life-consequence: Every innocent victim will die: The young men - directly or indirectly - by the hands of Keller/Loki, the girls, because no one ever got the idea to ask a psychologist to TALK to the two obviously mentally ill/disordered boys to find an answer. Instead they are tortured or lead into suicide, the only chance to find a trace gets literally smashed, which gives the real kidnapper enough time to accomplish her work. (Which is even more annoying, after Loki must have recognized, that he came furthest with cool-headed investigation, while his fit of rage did ruin everything)\u00b0Prisoners/Hollywood-consequence: That's alright, because in the end everything will be fine, no matter what you do, because you are the good guy. Just sit down and relax, god and destiny will fix everything for you and turn the world into a lollipop-sky-loft with cute little rainbow-unicorns.2) Alex, a mentally ill, traumatized and, as we see, innocent boy, is tortured and violated in the most brutal way, with heat, frost, darkness, his head is nearly smashed and who knows what other bodily parts,too. \u00b0RLC: If lucky, Alex will die by the terrible injuries or a following inflammation, as he had no water, no food and the old house was full of dirt. In any case he will keep long-term damages, not only physically, he is now more traumatized than ever before. Almoust certainly he is going to kill himself sooner or later. \u00b0P/HC: That's alright, just put an article into a newspaper about a wonderful family-reunion, so the audience will know, he will live happily ever after - you know, with the rainbow-unicorns I mentioned before.3) Keller didn't achieve anything by his outrage, except leaving his family alone in their fear and grief, (nearly) killing an innocent boy, playing into the hands of kidnapper Holly Jones by keeping away Alex, who could have given a real clue with the real treatment, and turning himself into a victim of evil Holly by acting careless and imprudent.\u00b0RLC: Keller will die in that hole in the belief, that his daughter is dead - which will happen with the utmost probability. Even if he escaped, his family would turn away from him (if his wife did not die accidentally of an overdose of sleeping pills before, which is most likely), because he did not care about them all the time, brought his daughter into great danger and turned himself into a monster by violating a victim like his own daughter without any effect. He will go to jail for that - just like his two friends, whose daughter will then have no parents anymore, just like Anna is left behind with an imprisoned father, a disillusioned brother and a mother addicted to pills. \u00b0P/HC: That doesn't matter, because you're meant to be the good guy, and good guys always get saved in the end, and if anybody had a doubt about the fact, that you're the good guy, your wife will point it out loudly and proudly for the audience once more and explain, that you just did what you had to do (which does not make any sense at all, because his actions lead into nothing), that everything will be alright now and that you will be forgiven for everything.It was an interesting idea for a movie to ask the question: How far would you go to save someone you love, and what if it turns you into a more awful monster than the one you are chasing? Because in the end there is not much difference between Holly and Keller and between what they are willing to do to innocent children. The main character has done everything wrong and his actions had to be leading into a dark and deep abyss - including the death of his daughter, the death of Alex, the imprisoning of his friends, maybe the accidentally suicide of his wife and, not to forget, his own death. Instead the moral of this story is, that the end always justifies the means, torture and witch hunt are alright, no matter against whom, when you're the good guy, as who you are above reproach. In my opinion this movie is a complete failure, because the creators were too scared or too contracted (or too scared of a contracted audience) to bring their storyline to an adequate ending.",

            "review_title": "Prisoners is a touching drama, a suffocating suspense and a magnificent detective film",
            "content": "Most filmmakers understand the importance of telling a good story, but not many realize how creating an atmosphere is equally important - and even rarer are those who manage to do this task successfully. Thus, watching a film like Prisoners is a rare cinephile's pleasure, since, in addition to creating a sad and distressing universe, this new work by Canadian Denis Villeneuve also brings a complex and precisely constructed plot.The script written by the almost newcomer Aaron Guzikowski (Contraband, 2012) builds very efficiently and honestly - small clues that lead to the denouement are distributed from the first minutes of the exhibition - a plot where two middle-class families are involved in a nightmare, when their young daughters disappear. Referring - in story and tone - to works such as Zodiac, Seven, Memoirs of Murder, Mystic River, The Promise and The Silence of the Lake (the original), Prisoners lives up to these fabulous companions by accompanying characters tormented by the disappearance of two little girls during the Thanksgiving holiday. Initially certain of having found the person responsible when arresting young Alex Jones (Dano), Detective Loki (Gyllenhaal) soon shows concern when he finds that the boy has the IQ. Of a ten-year-old child, being forced to release him for lack of evidence. In an act of desperation, Keller Dover (the father of one of the little girls) kidnaps a young suspect and begins an unthinkable torture session to get him to confess the children's whereabouts. There is an obvious merit in the script which is, in addition to tying all the situations together very well, the conception of the characters; whether the alleged kidnapper has a mental problem or the victim who becomes as cruel as the executioner himself.With a simple initial story, which has as its main characteristic the family appeal, Denis Villeneuve cuts it with his direction. Creating an aura of suspense from the first few seconds (which sometimes resembles the unstable universe of David Fincher's \"Zodiac\"), which becomes even greater due to the cold and impersonal North American city in which everything takes place (point for the photography by Roger Deakins), the filmmaker knows like few others to hold and release the rhythm of this long plot. And all in a way that makes us sure that we are facing a film of differentiated quality. Her ambition grows along with the story, and for that we respect her, even when she doesn't seem to be going anywhere.The work of Roger Deakins shows a sad and melancholy atmosphere from the foreground by investing in a palette that, dipped in shades of gray and brown, envelops the characters in a constant cold - and, at a certain point, Deakins and Villeneuve reach the point of making the transition from a rain shower to a snowstorm in the same scene, marking not only the complete deterioration of the relationships between the characters of Jackman and Gyllenhaal (the change occurs at the moment when the first is observed by the second), but also of the psychological state of the two men. Furthermore, Deakins is skilled at creating an atmosphere that is always claustrophobic, initiating the strategy the moment the children's parents realize that they have disappeared and are seen in a room that, until then cozy, suddenly seems to squeeze them in with its low ceiling and its walls close to each other.This is the perfect scenario for Villeneuve to develop a perfect detective story conceived by the screenwriter, which contains striking twists and plants several important and, at first glance, irrelevant clues (which may go unnoticed by the less observant viewer). The climax is the result of a meticulous construction that had been done since the first act, yielding important consequences for all the characters. Without rushing or giving easy answers through images, the director never deceives the audience. He just asks for a little patience to follow a meticulous investigation, full of dark facts, but knowing the way to dose them. And it becomes increasingly psychological, entering the minds of its characters, making them act in ways they would never have imagined. Here is also another strong feature of the film: unpredictability. You can even confirm your suspicions at the end, but being sure of them even in the development of the facts is impossible. Inserting and extracting elements, as well as adding and crossing out suspects from the investigated list, the narrative involves every second.In addition to the harrowing and detailed investigation, it is interesting to observe the human tragedy that manifests itself in the families as they wait for the reunion with their missing daughters. In an intense and explosive performance, Hugh Jackman continues to impress with his dramatic charge as he plays the impulsive Keller, who ends up \"taking justice\" into his own hands by chasing the character of Paul Dano (another great actor who still lacks a role that allow you to explore your potential). But who really stands out is Jake Gyllenhaal and his detective Loki (no connection with Thor's brother, for the record), who gets a careful portrait of the actor - note the tic of the blink of an eye that Gyllenhaal often manifests -, in radical contrast with Keller's wild persona by opting for a predominantly calm voice.Denis Villeneuve once again demonstrates the narrative control displayed in the great Incendies and Polytechnique by keeping the viewer always tense through his always evocative paintings - from the one that brings the character of Maria Bello lying down as if in a coffin to those that, slightly inclined, indicate the instability of those people. In addition, the filmmaker perfectly understands the concept of suspense, creating clear and strong expectations in the audience only to postpone its conclusion, as in the beautiful sequence that brings a desperate race in traffic, at night and in the rain, until the one that uses the lights. Automatic detections of a small neighborhood to indicate the movement of a suspect. In addition, the melancholy photography is perfectly complemented by the production design and costumes, which keep the brown tones always in the picture. To top it off, editors Joel Cox and Gary Roach use the constant fades not as lazy transitions (a mistake made by so many professionals), but as a way of introducing ellipses at moments when the film seems on the verge of indulging in formulaic actions and the viewer is able to imagine alone.Which brings us, finally, to Aaron Guzikowski's beautiful script, which builds a complex plot that depends on several incidents presented in a seemingly disjointed way, but which eventually fit together without leaving a single unexplained, Guzikowski is skillful in suggesting elements of the personalities. Of their characters through quick details, such as a brief animal torture, a newspaper clipping revealing the suicide of Keller's father (who, thematically perfect, was a jailer), or the mention of Loki's past, raised in an orphanage. . In addition, the screenwriter shows a unique talent for introducing clues that, contrary to what happens in so many features, are established without drawing excessive attention to themselves (the red whistle, the mention of the abandoned Dover apartment, the boy who disappeared for so long time, the disappearance of Alex's uncle), which makes the rewards even more satisfying.Also introducing thematic elements that make clear the importance of the characters' religious devotion from the foreground - something fundamental if we consider the motivation behind the crimes -, Prisoners still makes a counterpoint between Keller's faith and his actions, deserving the moment to be highlighted. In which he fails to conclude the Our Father by recognizing his own hypocrisy by almost reciting the \"just as we forgive those who have offended us\" (and it is fantastic, the decision of the composer J\u00f3hann J\u00f3hannsson to include organ chords, referring to the Church, the moment the subject is thrown into his private purgatory). As if that weren't enough, Guzikowski avoids the mistake of justifying the torture, converting Keller's discovery into a final dramatic irony, since, although he ends up discovering what happened, his finding plays no role in the outcome, since it's up to Detective Loki, with his meticulous investigation and use of reason, the role of finding the criminal.With two and a half hours of film, character development is valued - and there is room for Jackman and Gyllenhaal, both doing one of their best work. Alongside the equally great Dano and Stamp, Jackman channels his best Wolverine in the form of a concerned father. The female characters, however, receive only one good scene each, which could have been better explored. With an oppressive atmosphere, uninterested in gratuitous scares, Prisoners alternates the stories of the father and the detective, both in their spiral of obsession. The film respects the viewer's intelligence, presenting concrete clues at all times, which maintains the audience's engagement, which is faced not only with the mystery of the whereabouts of the girls, but also with the moral dilemmas of their parents. As in Zodiac, the nature of the investigation and its impact on the investigator take on almost as much importance as the mystery. The maturity of the script and the direction is greater than any answer.Sinning only by not leaving the outcome as ambiguous as it seems to wish, Prisoners is a touching drama, a suffocating suspense and a magnificent detective film. Prisoners will not change the history of the genre, nor will it stand out as a landmark in it, but it follows the rules competently and extracts the best of its proposal, being able to send the viewer home still playing with the pieces of the puzzle.",

The entire film revolved around Keller and the detective both of who wasn't very likable characters as one of them was very bad at his job and the other tortured a mentally challenged victim throughout the whole film. The maze man that ran away from the detective at the candlelight vigil and then shot himself in the head at the police station under custody? Was he a relative of the couple that lost their kids and took revenge on god by kidnapping other people's kids? And how were snakes relevant? They found snakes in locked containers in the maze guy's house too. The best detail of the movie was the father killed a man that confessed him about killing kids. The detective found the body of the man coincidentally in the basement of the father and it was the husband of the woman who was shot dead by he detective while administering something to the Kellers daughter. Before that she forced Keller with gun to go down in the hole under the old car in the garden. He found the whistle down there and the detective heard the whistle standing in the garden all alone after forensic team went away. The plot was good but I hate when American movies try too hard to have an extremely happy and desired ending as if they want to not make anyone leave the theater upset. Besides, the details about the kidnapped families fascination with snakes and mazes weren't clear. It was hard watching the mentally challenged being tortured and he was also kidnapped by the couple and he wasn't related to them at all but in the end he reunited with his family long time after like the girls.",

Hugh Jackman's performance stands as a landmark in his career as an actor. He plays a father who is in search of his missing daughter and will go at any lengths to find her. The emotion in his eyes and voice carries from the screen to the audience because we can relate so well to the film. Jake Gyllenhaal also gave an outstanding performance as detective Loki. One other thing that caught my eye was the incredible cinematography and musical score. There is something about the filming technique that really gets under your skin. It allows the audience to see what the actors can't see anticipating what may or may not happen.This makes the film all the more unsettling. The musical score is just down right creepy and manages to give you goose bumps. It also adds on to the psychologically gripping feel of the film. Capable of being disturbing, suspenseful, compelling, emotional, and clever all at the same time. Overall, Prisoners is an edge of your seat thriller that's both heart-wrenching and mind-blowing.",

But for a 2.5 hr movie, there should have been some better explanations. There are four instances where an extremely important plot point was done off-screen, making you ask, 'How did the cop know to go there, or why would that father pick that house'... no explanation and even worse, the next scene appears without telling you what happened.It is like seeing our hero jump off a cliff and in the next scene the hero is walking on a stree without telling you how he survived the jump...yes this movie does that multiple times.The last 30 minutes the simple plot was so convoluted that you are not sure who kidnapped who. The movie tries so hard to contort user's expectations that it makes no sense at all(unless you turn your brain off).",

            "review_title": "'Prisoners' takes none in a disturbing and utterly compelling story of masculine ordeal, religious conviction and exigent moral dilemmas in the face of child abduction.",
            "content": "The two main protagonists \u2013 played by Jake Gylenhaal and Hugh Jackman \u2013 are two men who see it as a moral imperative, as men, to protect others. 'Prisoners' confidently examines the consequences of their failure to do so when two young girls are abducted; and they are subsequently faced against an adversary they don't quite know how to handle.The screenplay pits a masculine sense of duty to protect one's child against religious, societal and moral forbearance. Then we watch the consequences of this fascinating clash. When blue collar patriot, religious man; and failing carpenter Keller Dover \u2013 played by Hugh Jackman \u2013 has his daughter abducted, this all American alpha father channels his inner Wolverine rage and decides to take the law into his own hands. In an attempt to find his abducted daughter, and her abducted friend, he sets out on a crusade to terrorize information from Paul Dano's mentally challenged character; whom he firmly believes is responsible for the kidnapping.Even though you got the sense that Jackman goes Oscar hunting, the real stand out is Jake Gyllenhaal; in an incredibly understated but subtlety complex performance as Detective Loki; the officer in charge of the case to find the missing girls. This is familiar ground for Gylenhaal, after the likes of 'Zodiac', and 'End of Watch', but he finds new depths and makes this character completely independent from any film has appeared in before. He is by far the most compelling character. Like the way Detective Loki pays attention to the details when trying to solve the mystery, we to, as an audience, have to pay attention to the details. Notice the recurring blinking of his eyes, or the moments of brutality he enforces. There are also brief glimpses of tattoos; that all add depth and mystery to a character with a past only ever curiously alluded to.We are treated to the simple but effective direction of Clint Eastwood and the chilling thrills and revelations of David Fincher. Canadian Denis Villeneuve \u2013 in his American debut \u2013 is a director prepared to use a tripod, and rely on the simple grace of the close-up and all the drama it brings. Roger Deakins gives the film a burdening sense of dread through his atmospherically beautiful cinematography; that lends itself fittingly to a dark story about the loss of innocence. He is truly one of the best DP's working today.The snow and ice of North America is used an awful lot as a backdrop for murder mystery thrillers; but it is a genre trope I embrace. It never fails to highlight the ice cold brutality of the story. Almost as if there were some correlation between our unrelenting natural world, and the killers/abductors that dwell in it.And 'Prisoners' is as cold as it gets. This is a dark and violent story. If that puts you off, it should be known that the violence never feels pointless, or exploitative, and it is handled in good taste to perfectly serve the story. A well played reveal of the physical abuse that a victim of torture receives is now ingrained in my mind.'Zodiac', 'The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo', 'Mystic River' and the recent 'The Frozen Ground' are all similar genre films; and 'Prisoners' is up there with the best of them. It's slow burning; playing for over 150 minutes. But only by taking its time, are we allowed to immerse ourselves and get invested in the investigation and characters. It's not a perfect movie by any means; but a great one? sure. It's one of the best mystery thrillers I can remember seeing over the last few years.You might get lost in this maze of a movie; but you have to play detective to keep up. Deduce all you want, but this was a mystery I could not solve; and the grand revelation I really did not see coming. I can appreciate a movie that manages to successfully manipulate me into thinking that the answer is in that chest, when in fact it was another. We twist and turn through a morally complex abyss, full of religious symbolism, engaging characters; mystery and shock value.Go to hughesreviews.co.uk for the full article and many more reviews!",

I was a huge fan of the director's previous film Incendies, but this one is just a B grade thriller that is elevated by masterful cinematography, excellent direction, and some truly great acting by the entire cast. This movies is filled with interesting ideas that have to brushed aside in service of a plot which would not be out of place in your average Law & Order episode. The film has a strange religious subtext that is both underdeveloped and overwrought. I could see half of the plot twists coming and in the third act the film basically became a Law & Order episode with an overly simple resolution and \"ambiguous\" ending. The real problem here is the script. It does have some interesting ideas like the quirks of Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal's characters, but these and others have almost no development beyond the one or two scenes that feature them. If the director had been allowed to rewrite the script the film would have been a lot better and likely have the same impact as the director's previous film. That being said the film is still a well-acted, well- filmed, and intermittently well-written thriller that is extremely emotionally effective and occasionally disturbing.",

But! Boom- the so atmosphere in the film is made so great&suspense at the same time like watching a horror movie where I can't wait what will happen in the next corner,an eye look,a sound or after the next scene.All credits to the director and of course the cast,where I need to say that Jake Gyllenhaal performance in this film is the greatest of all time !Why? Because he developed and is experienced method and character actor,who have described the difference along the lines that they are not playing a character, but inhabiting one. The lines they speak are not because that is whats written in the script, it's actually what the character, with their story and background and experience, would actually say.I firmly believe that such actors are The Best ones,Hollywood as such has not many..let's say about 8-10,but one such promising Actor will soon join them.Jake Gyllenhall of course is the one I'm talking about.But... That's just my opinion.We can also see that he is growing and improving as an Actor,plus he can play very different roles,his capabilities as an actor is magnificent.He is young,at the beginning but his beginning and what an Actor he is had only a few ones in Hollywood,who are today Top class Actors... and where Directors and Producers are fighting between themselves about in which Blockbuster Movie they will play the lead character. :) p.s. My best method or character actor is Anthony Hopkins but there are also some very famous other Actors...",

            "review_title": "Truly a great film",
            "content": "The film is based on a disturbing topic that can affect anyone. Prisoners, directed by Denis Villeneuve (Incendies) and written by Aaron Guzikowski (Contraband), is a suspenseful thriller that leaves the viewer thinking this could happen to them. Prisoners follows two families and the kidnapping of their children. The film's dialogue develops each character differently, driving some mad while leaving others feeling helpless. As the story line develops it shows the range of everyone's emotions during this situation. Along with detective Loki, the two families must hold on to their sanity and their hope as all hope is constantly lost in the discovery of who has taken their children. Prisoners begins on an ordinary American Thanksgiving Day. Both families (The Dovers and the Birchs) celebrate Thanksgiving together, having a good time. While the parents are preparing dinner, the children go for a walk down the street, on this walk they stumble upon an old almost broken down looking RV. This creeps out the teenagers of the two families, who were accompanying the two younger children, they return home and have Thanksgiving dinner. Everything seems fine until the two little girls decide to go to the other family's house to look for a red whistle and do not return. Both families become immediately worried that their children are missing. The centre of attention is then brought to the RV and its driver, a 30 year old man with the IQ of a ten year old as the primary suspect for the kidnapping. Detective Loki takes charge and finds many potential suspects who all end up having connections. These connections bring together an unravelling ending leaving the viewer surprised, pleased, and leaving the theatre still thinking about the movie.The characters, and the actors who portrayed them, in Prisoners were a key element that really made this film work. Although there are many actors who brought this film together, there are really three who stood out. First, Kelly Dover (Hugh Jackman), a middle aged man with two kids and a wife. Kelly is prepared for what seems like everything, except for what happens on Thanksgiving Day. As the film develops we see the situation eat away at Kelly driving his sanity through a window as he believes his daughter should have been found by now. Leaving him looking more like a suspect than others.Secondly, Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal), a never quit detective who has solved every case he has been involved in to date. Detective Loki's name and character in general come from Greek mythology where Loki is a Greek God. One of the myths associated with Loki is that he saved children after other Gods had given up, this is the basis of detective Loki's character as he doesn't give up to find the children. This no quit attitude satisfies the viewers, because we know there is hope, and that they will be found. I admired how Aaron also pays homage to this God during a scene with snakes. There is a myth that the God Loki is terrified of snakes after an event was performed by his mother as a child involving snakes. Loki's background is never truly developed, this works, as it leaves the viewers focusing on urgency of the present situation. However, there are some hints that his background involves some abuse due to the fact that he is so involved in this case. Alex Jones (Paul Dano) is the character who takes this film to the next level. Alex is portrayed as an adult with the IQ of a ten year old as he has suffered from an unexplained accident that occurred during his childhood. At the beginning of the film Alex is that character that the viewers want to hate on, we want him to be the prime suspect. He is that creepy, almost disturbing looking character. He occasionally mutters some words to Kelly like \"They cried after I left them\", which throws Kelly into his barbaric state, thinking Alex is the one responsible. As the film develops and we see Kelly take his anger out on Alex, we almost feel sorry for Alex as he begins to look innocent. Dano portrays his character so well that Alex ends up becoming a victim. The collaboration between the cinematographer (Roger Deakins) and the editing team was performed very well throughout out the film. The location of the scenes were pointed out very clearly as to not confuse the viewer and take them away from what they should be really focusing on. I absolutely loved the turning point in this film solely based on the editing and that its shots were action focused. The editors created this sense of urgency through quick cuts from Loki to the victim, to what Loki was driving through, and how we see the image begin to blur during Loki's point of view. Bringing a sense of realism to what the situation was evolving to. There was also some pretty neat shots were we see Loki driving like a maniac threw traffic. Even thought Prisoners follows a disturbing topic, it is a must see. From the moment we are persuaded it is Alex who is responsible for this heinous crime, to the side trail Loki finds that connects everything to the final unravelling, the viewer is kept on the edge of their seat, waiting for what is going to happen next. Every aspect of this film just clicked. This includes the amazing actors who brought their characters to life, the wonderful setting that set the tone for the film. I also really enjoyed the cinematographers' and editors' work and how they added so much suspense to the film. The audio was also a bonus that helped set the tone to this amazing film. In the end it was the screenplay written by Aaron Guzikowski that truly set this film apart from the rest.",

            "content": "Prisoners is a suspenseful slow-burn with only brief character development and a simple idea, but it's able to have you captivated and anticipating for the entire story. Hugh Jackman is a desperate father who takes matters into his own hands when the police take too much time to find his missing daughter. Missing person case stories are often gripping, automatically, but then a lot of them end up disappointing us; this is not one of them.Being a crime-related mystery containing characters you actually care for without a massive introduction to them, the biggest thing about this movie are the notable feelings delivered by the ENTIRE cast. You can feel the extreme anger and desperation from Hugh Jackman as a father searching for his daughter and the confident frustration from Jake Gyllenhaal as a detective, all the way to the major worry experienced by the parents and you can understand why their teenage kids get upset about certain things.Although it's a fairly long movie, there's no boring moment or sequence that doesn't cover another detail to the story. During the crime-mystery sequences, there's also use of a tone that slides under the thriller genre which is also very intriguing and have an effective impact on the movie. Detective scenes are captured with frustration and are always accompanied by suitable weather depictions, or are even just filmed under daylight or during nighttime. It's a very well-made movie, and the story will never bore you, but it's best for older teens and up.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",

Prisoners delivers a mix of predictable suspense with some elements of surprise, like the ending. The movie entangles you in an emotional roller-coaster then stops prematurely. I loved the movie, but left feeling twisted & robbed. The cast was superb and the story unraveled nicely but collapsed hard on you at the end. Its a terrible feeling that the director puts you through and I hate him for that. I would wait for the DVD and hopefully he will fix the ending on a special extended directors cut edition then you will have the ending this movie deserves. It is just not complete, why start something if you are not going to complete it? Its like an incomplete sentence you get from a loved one on their death bed. \"I left you a million dollars in cash in the back of .........?\"",

What an excellent thriller.On reading the sleeve I almost didn't bother as at over two and a half hours long, I didn't think it would keep my interest. How wrong I was.The plot centres around two young girls being kidnapped, and the efforts the police and the families make to try to find them. This brief description however gives no indication of the tension that builds throughout the film, the superb acting and great directing.I'm not a huge fan of Hugh Jackman as a rule. It's not that I don't like him, it's just that he doesn't appear in films that generally appeal to me. However I'm prepared to eat my words for this film. His acting was first rate. Jake Gyllenhaal on the other hand has always been a favourite of mine right since the incredible Donnie Darko, and here he proves just how good he is.I have to admit, that great though these both were, and fine supporting from everyone else, the person who stood out - although his part was relatively small - was Paul Dano. His acting is quite exemplary.The film itself does not seem long at all, indeed as the final stages approach, it travels at quite a pace and is edge of seat stuff.Well worth a watch and possibly one of the very best thrillers I've seen for quite some time.

Even when you can still tell who was the filmmaker behind this movie, it goes underappreciated.A lot of people have highlighted both Gyllenhaal and Jackman in this movie for their performances. Even when I can somewhat value them on a certain level, for the most part I just found the bigger picture annoying. Even while watching, I could only think of their performances as part of an average filmbro's TikTok compilation of \"the best male performances of all time\" and just put the bits of them shouting.The script could only do so much and, as an intent to make this movie seem like it's giving out a ton of information and plot points, they managed to extend this movie for an extremely long runtime. I understand there was the purpose of having a slowburn, slow-paced film that sort of ressembled the grief portrayed. But I have the misfortune of just overlooking it since that was the only intent behind having this movie be 2 and-a-half hours long.All I'm saying is that Prisoners will only pass down in history as the movie that supported the shift in Villeneuve's filmmaking trajectory, which is exactly the way this movie has been seen as since 2013, for better or worse...",

Cons: - The detective guy (Gyllen Haal) was absolutely irrelevant to the plot. He could have been absent and the film would have been the same. Just send one of the cops(anyone) to that woman to let her know that her nephew was found. That random person could have shot that woman and saved the day. Other than this one random fluke, the guy had no contribution towards solving the case. This fluke could have been attributed to damn near about anyone who was sent to give her the news about her nephew. - The father (Huge) does all the detective works in the movie. Which makes you wonder why the actual detective was being presented as some genius Sherlock Holmes in the beginning of the film. Yeah, they were bragging about how he solved every damn case he came across. Ironically, this movie is about the one where he didn't contribute at all. - The detective seemed totally indifferent to the father's reaction after showing him the images of his daughter's blood soaked socks. He wasn't even trying to show that he was sorry through body language/facial expression.It is actually the story about the negligence of the police in that town. If you think about it, you'll realise that if the cops only did their job, they'd be the one discovering what the father discovered. But heck! They had other things to do such as reading up old newspaper about the father(Huge)'s dad and following the father around. They invested time and resources into everything but solving the actual crime. I mean, really? They actually believed that someone with an IQ of 10 roams around with a caravan and could take dogs out for walks at night? This forces me to conclude that the story was about police failures, not psycho killers.",

            "content": "Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal have teamed with relatively unknown director Denis Villeneuve to bring one of the greatest Thrillers of 2013. \"Pray for the best, but prepare for the worst,\" is a line Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) lives his life by. But when the unimaginable happens, and his daughter and her friend are kidnapped, Keller takes matters into his own hands when the police seem unable to act.Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) has solved every case he's ever been assigned. He and Keller are after the same goal, to see the girls home alive, but their methods differ; one of composure, one of desperation. Now, onto discussing the brilliance of this film. For me, it really comes down to three factors: the story, the acting, and the fantastic moments of tension. Essentially, these are the elements that every film of the Thriller genre will strive to perfect, and Prisoners hits the nail on the head for all three.Boasting a run time of over two and half hours, Prisoners has a lot of story to tell. Long films aren't always a good thing, when you stretch a film to that length of time it typically starts to stagger at some point. But with Prisoners, it worked. It wasn't slow, but neither did it feel rushed, the Director told the story he wanted to tell in what felt like its entirety. The story also managed to remain intriguing without throwing twists and turns and revelations into the script every few minutes, and this is partly due to the fantastic characters and their relationships with one another.However, it doesn't matter how great a script is, especially in the Thriller genre, if you haven't got the actors to deliver the material. Jake Gyllenhaal is an immensely versatile actor, and he fits into the role of Detective Loki beautifully. Even for such a recognisable face, I didn't see Mr Gyllenhaal on screen in front of me, I only saw Detective Loki, doing everything in his power to find the missing girls. Hugh Jackman, in addition, performed genuine Academy Award winning acting for this performance. When Keller filled with sorrow, I had a lump in my throat and tears in my eyes. When Keller filled with fury, my fists and jaw clenched. When Keller collapsed in grief, I slumped in my chair. To call his performance gripping would be a mammoth understatement.Finally, the tension. A trademark of the genre, if you can make your audience's hearts pound in their chests at the right moment, you're on your way to a winning product. Prisoner's has an excellent amount of tension, and by that I don't mean a wealth of it. A balance has to be struck to keep the audience gripped, but to make them really appreciate the tension when it comes by not over-doing it. Prisoners did it so well, I was literally sat on the edge of my seat in one of the closing scenes, and had my heart pounding on a number of occasions. I will be shocked of this film does not attain the prestige it deserves. If you are a fan of the Thriller genre, I really cannot recommend this film enough. Make sure to take your partner or your friends with you, because you're going to want to discuss this masterpiece at length when the credits start to roll.",

The set up of the two girls disappearing and the realization they have been taken was excellent, and the lead performances were all believable and very intense. However, without divulging the specific revelations in the final hour, for me they seemed very far fetched, and the action scenes, especially the car-chase scene, so far over the top and excessive that they bordered on hokey. Still, the film overall is not bad, but at over two and a half hours, it left me feeling disappointed, and could have been about 30 minutes shorter. I had some questions about certain parts, but it is one of those films I wouldn't want to see again, as there are almost no moments to actually enjoy. I loved \"The Butler\", and \"Instructions Not Included\", but can only marginally recommend \"Prisoners\" due to its unrelenting grimness and length.",

            "content": "Prisoners succeeds in the building of tension whilst equally failing in pacing. This really is the sort of film that needs to be watched at least twice. There's a lot for any viewer to pick up from in terms of the films theming, subtext and hidden meaning for the first time around. Prisoners is a film packed to the brim, asking its audience many questions, although not necessarily answering them all to the extent you may expect.The story follows a detective - Jake Gyllenhaal - on the hunt to find a kidnapper, brought to his attention through the abduction of two children in the local area.A synopsis like that certainly peaked my interest, however, that wasn't what go me attached to the film in the first place. Instead it was the director - Denis Villenueve - who had previously worked with Gyllenhaal in \"Enemy\".As I had expected, Prisoners' best facet was its direction, presented through its meaningful cinematography and powerful performances. Similarly to Enemy, Prisoners fulfils its artistic qualities allowing it to be analysed in depth.I will admit, the film took a while to get going. I wouldn't go as far to say I was ever bored, although, my attention was wearing thin during some parts in the second act. This is a problem a lot of thrillers can face, they spend too much time building tension rather than actually showing the consequences of the character's actions. Avoiding spoiler territory, I must say that when the film did begin its climax it was very satisfying, tied off well with an expertly shot, fast paced car journey.Prisoners can feel rather repetitive at times, however, what pulled it back from appearing dull were Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal. They both delivered stellar performances, especially in the case of Gyllenhaal. It is incredibly commendable the extend to which he projects his characters through little things such as mannerisms, facial tics and tattoos. Apart from some slightly cringe-inducing child acting near the beginning, Prisoners is worth watching for its performances alone.Overall, Prisoners is a great watch. Although a little slow at some parts, there are few films that execute suspense quite as well. The ending is satisfying, yet leaves a little to be desired, not being quite as succinct as I was hoping for. Its certainly worth your time.",

The plot is extremely intricate, and at times confusing - though this is what grips your attention throughout, until a shocking reveal in the final 30 mins. The ambiguity to the ending was genius, and one of the films strengths. I particularly loved Gyllenhaal's idea to give his character a tic (which became more frequent the more distressed he felt.) It is hinted that he has a haunted past, and I felt that his character could have been given a backstory to explain his drive.The frustration from Drover, who feels Detective Loki's (Gyllenhaal) by-the-book, methodical approach to the case isn't enough was really interesting. Though both men strive for the same end - to return the girls to safety - Jackman's character is led down a path of moral descent. Once a godly man, the grief-stricken father turns to alcohol and bloody violence as a means of justice. (The film seems to be more of a character study of the two men than anything else.) Prisoners is thoroughly enjoyable- a success from Denis Villeneuve.More time could have been dedicated to the character of Bob Taylor & his trauma which has led to him becoming obsessed with Mazes and the \"Invisible Man\" (maybe an interview scene). I feel like this could have elevated the film more. Also the character of Alex - Did he have the mind of a ten year old? Or did he understand perfectly what his role was in the numerous abductions? (There could have been a scene of him being questioned in the final moments, an Edward Norton in Primal Fear style revelation would have tipped this over the edge)Deakins cinematography is stunning. I very much appreciated the dark hues of blue and the solid, illuminating light in the background which creates a silhouette effect around the characters. Several shots are cleverly framed like this around Gyllenhaal (almost like he was destined to be the saviour/hero of the story from the start).",

I really did not know too much about the film, other then it was a thriller/mystery with Hugh Jackman, that's it. I had no idea what kind of an edge of my seat/nearly out of breath movie this was going to be after I sat down in the theater.Every performance is incredibly well done and acted, especially Jackman and Gyllenhaal, the two main characters we follow through most of the story. It was tempting to make a statement out loud regarding Marvel references, considering Jake's characters name is Loki (of Asgard!), and Hugh Jackman. (well, you know, schnick!) That aside, both Jake and Hugh are excellent in this film. You may think that Keller (H.J.) is just out for blood to find his daughters, but he had legitimate reasons for doing what he does to find that answers and save his and his friend Franklin's (Terrence Howard) daughters. Loki is a no nonsense cop who \"has solved all of his cases\", and is extremely determined to find out who is behind the kidnappings and why.While this movie is 2.5 hours long, it really pulls you into the suspense, feeling for each characters emotions and \"praying for the best, and preparing for the worst\" throughout the whole film. Not in a long time have I been legitimately worried about the safety and lives of fictional characters in a movie. This movie is extremely gruesome at times, but just the right amount of grittiness that makes it all the better.Excellent film: brilliant cinematography, acting, suspense, and story, bringing to the big screen one of the best movies of 2013, and may very well hold that honor come the end of the year.Prisoners: 10/10",

            "content": "Prisoners is a film best left not knowing much about it. It's a long, slow-paced crime thriller. It requires the viewers to invest themselves emotionally, and will often keep the viewer on the edge of their seats throughout it's many twists and turns. Prisoners is tedious at times because of it's slow unravelling nature, however this is used to draw the viewer in and join in this thriller. More films like this need to be made and it's a shame that Hollywood won't touch this subject matter more often. Prisoners is quite a dark and disturbing story. However I felt that it didn't quite push itself as far as it could have. That being said it still is a very dark thriller, and one of the best in recent memory. Hugh Jackman is outstanding in this film, and hopefully he gets an Oscar nod. However unfortunately I feel that this film will be ignored by the time it comes to award season. All the actors in this film are great and it's a well acted machine. Prisoners is also very well directed. I cannot recommend this film enough and easily will say this is one of the best films of the year. It's not without it's problems but this is one thriller not to miss!!Rating: 9 out of 10",

Cartoonish might be the word we're it no for the incredibly troubling, violent acts at the heart of this film. Mostly very well shot but nothing again to save a film that very early on seems determined to go after the big shocks and too obvious horrors for the reviewer to really care, apart from the regular repulsion factor. Not terrible but thin and disappointing. Despite an excellent start, it quickly resorted to cliches and cut-out characters. Less could have been so much more.",

            "content": "I saw the late night showing of Prisoners last night at the Alamo Drafthouse Richardson, TX. I was instantly sucked into the beautiful yet gritty cinematography and the director made me feel as if the little girls that were kidnapped were my own and that I was running out of time to find them. I love it when a director has the ability to draw in the audience in such an emotional way. Possible spoiler alert beyond this point:Prisoners is about two families with children in a nice suburban neighborhood that meet at one of their houses for a dinner party to unwind and enjoy each others company. Each family has a six year old daughter. The two young girls ask if they can go fetch something that they left at the other families house which is a couple of blocks away from the other families home, but they tell the little girls that they must have the older siblings permission and for them to accompany the small kids to the other home. The little girls don't ask the older kids to come with them and end up vanishing completely. The two families become very frantic and worried when they discovered that the little girls were playing near a really dirty, ran down looking RV from decades past. The police are notified, and then detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) accepts the case to find the missing girls. The police find the RV parked at a gas station at the edge of the woods. The police move in and arrest a very strange mentally disturbed, childlike man in his early 30's (Paul Dano). After long interrogation, the man is released and the father of the young white girl (Hugh Jackman) becomes enraged and decides to take matters of finding his daughter into his own hands. The film now becomes a desperate race against the clock to find out what has happen to the missing girls. Desperate measures are enacted and the parents of these children must decide how far they are willing to cross the line in order to find their kids. I would imaging that this film is very disturbing and frightening to parents of small children. I am not a parent, but I am an uncle of a 3 year old boy, and I would do the same thing Hugh Jackman did for sure.I would recommend this film to people that enjoy intense dramas, but spoiler alert: this film will make you crazy with emotion, and there is a lot of crying and freaking out from the parents of the little girls.I rated this film 8 of 10 because I thought the ending could have been better. The film was a perfect 10 until the last 5-10 min.I would like to note that Paul Dano who plays Alex is a very talented actor and he plays Alex so well that you forget he is an actor and not really a mentally disturbed victim/ kidnapper. This film shows how the kidnappers brainwash their victims with LSD & Ketamine cocktails. (that should answer everybody's questions about how can a kidnapped person identify with their kidnappers and not run away. It's because the strip their mental image of who they are with the drugs)Lastly, I was kidnapped when I was 2 years old (1985) at Richardson Square Mall in Richardson, TX while my mother was shopping. I was later re-united with my family. So this film really hit home about what could have happen to me.",

I really enjoyed watching this movie, so many great moments to keep you engaged, at one point i was shouting at the television.Jake Gyllenhaal, back at it again doing his thing and I'm impressed to say the least, what another great actor to be cast. I honestly love every peformance Gyllenhaal takes on as he really is an exceptional actor who we are lucky to be able to experience.The way this movie was written is ahead of our time completely, the way everything comes together is perfect storytelling and i loved the ending, a perfect one to end such an incredible story.Highly recommend!

            "content": "Pray for the best, prepare for the worst. This is the philosophy by which Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman), a carpenter living in Pennsylvania, lives by. He tells his teenaged son that the most important lesson his father taught him was to be ready for anything, but nothing could have prepared him for what is about to happen.Dover and his wife Grace (Maria Bello) are happily married with a teenaged son and a young daughter. The film opens with them going to eat Thanksgiving dinner at the home of their neighbors, Franklin and Nancy Birch (Terrence Howard and Viola Davis) and their two children of the same age as the Dover's kids. What starts out as a happy feast between the two families transforms into every parent's worst nightmare when the two young daughters ask if they can go to the Dovers' quickly. The children are allowed to leave, but they never return.Alex Jones (Paul Dano), who was driving an RV through the neighborhood around the same time the girls disappeared, is quickly apprehended and labeled the prime suspect. The problem is, Jones has the IQ of a ten-year-old, meaning there is no way he could successfully kidnap the girls and not leave a shred of evidence. So, he is released into the custody of his aunt (Melissa Leo) with orders to not leave the state. It doesn't come as a surprise that the parents, Keller in particular, are less than thrilled about this.Hugh Jackman has delivered some good performances in the past, most notably as the superhero Wolverine, but this is by far the best performance of his career. As the film progresses, Keller slowly becomes the kind of demon that a religious man like him would condemn. Although he is a man that the audience should feel remorse for, his actions throughout the film make you consider losing faith in him, but they also make you think long and hard about what you would do if you were in the same situation as him.At the opposite end of the spectrum is Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal), the lead detective on the case with a perfect arrest record and a determined look in his eyes. Unlike Keller, Loki doesn't have a personal life to speak of. Instead of celebrating Thanksgiving with family and friends, we see him eating his dinner in a diner and having a conversation with his waitress over the signs of the Chinese Zodiac on his placemat.Throughout the film, Keller and Loki butt heads every time they share the screen. Keller is determined to find his daughter by any means necessary. Loki is just as determined, but police scrutiny and his sound methods are leading the case in a direction that Keller doesn't agree with and there is nothing Loki can say or do that will convince him otherwise.The performances in the film are all top notch. Jackman and Gyllenhaal both deliver the best performances of their careers, each worthy of award consideration. Bello, Howard, and Davis don't have as much screen time as you would expect considering they're the parents just as much as Keller is. Dano, who I never really have liked as an actor, gives a great performance, his character's clothing and just the general look on his face make him seem like a total creep. Leo also shines in a small, but pivotal role, and Wayne Duvall also does some fine work as the chief of police that is making Loki follow the evidence instead of his gut. The real stars here, however, are the people behind the camera. Canadian director Denis Villeneuve (Incendies) had not made an English language film prior to this, but his previous films have displayed his talents from behind the camera and they show again here. Screenwriter Aaron Guzikowski (Contraband) took a generic plot idea and turned it on its side with a script that keeps the audience guessing while incorporating some powerful religious-based overtones to the story. Icelandic composer J\u00f3hann J\u00f3hannsson's score is electrifying. And the cinematography is some of the best from the great Roger Deakins, who has ten Academy Award nominations dating back to 1991, it's that good.As good a film as it is, Prisoners is not for everyone. Some of most pivotal scenes involve torture that might make you feel uneasy later on. The two-and-a-half hour running time and the slow pacing make the film drag on at certain points. With a little sharper editing, I think this film would have come out just as good, if not better, with a running time of about 20 minutes shorter, but the problem is that I can't think of any scene that would have been better of if left on the cutting room floor. That is my only issue with this movie, though. You will not forget Prisoners after you see it.FILM GRADE: A-",

They say he has a low IQ so he couldn't have done it alone. OK thats great but why then would you not look at his guardian after that? And he was a kidnapped boy himself so wouldn't he be in the system? I know he was not arrested , but seems to me they would check more then his name for a double kidnapping. Not to mention he wouldn't has a ssn and they can tell when he got it under that name which would lead to a DNA test anyway.After that though he is kidnapped and again by Jackman character. Why would that detective who has never lost a case not think to finish searching the residence finding him. Also don't these family men have jobs? Plus no captain would leave him without a car to watch him in the first place. Aside from that they have these clues to finding the girls like the maze, and chose to instead lead this line of Jackmans character torturing Alex. They do not have any part of this movie dedicated to what's going on with the girls so glad I didn't spend money when this was in theaters. Acting was good has a good plot with the kidnapping just done very wrong after the first few scenes. Very unrealistic from a legal stand point. Also did a bad job of keeping me engaged I paused the movie about halfway through to check my phone and facebook even got on youtube. Writing and directing failed this movie its a shame.",

The cinematography is simply fantastic and the whole movie is brilliantly captured. The story line has more twists and turns than the rabbit hole Alice fell down, literally keeping you on the edge of your seat the whole time. If you are a fan of psychological thrillers and movies that keep you guessing this is undeniably your proverbial cup of tea. Even if you aren't you will find this suspenseful drama utterly compelling. What more can I say? Without a shadow of a doubt go and see what is definitely the movie of the year so far.",

            "content": "\"Prisoners\", directed by Denis Villeneuve and written by Aaron Guzikowski, was an incredible story of one man who will do anything to find his daughter. Although the plot appears slow moving at first, your emotions are quickly taken for a wild ride as the plot constantly turns from one dilemma to the next, and just as soon as you think you've solved the case, a new twist sends you spiraling into a whole new line of reasoning forcing you to continuously ask \"who is really guilty?\"Furthermore, the cast chosen for this spectacle did a stunning job. Not only was the crises believable, but the characters were portrayed so well, that you yourself will ask \"where is his daughter?!\" This was by far one of Hugh Jackman's greatest performances where you truly saw a father who knew the questionable measures he'd have to take if he wanted to find his daughter. As time passes on, Keller Dover, (Hugh Jackman), displays overwhelming levels of desperation and the methods he uses, though could be considered cruel, forces the audience to question their sense of objective morality. Additionally, I tip my hat off to Jake Gyllenhaal, who also did an equally spellbinding performance as Detective Loki. From what was just another case, became the focal mission of his career as he anxiously desires to find both missing daughters alive. Finally, you will not be disappointed with the conclusion, as you see that every ounce of what appeared to be trivial information is actually fundamentally one great big basket weave of a greater evil truth. This movie will constantly leave you on the edge of your seat, and I assure you, that this movie will be something you'll want to watch again and again.Amazing!!! 10/10",

This film has everything, it has tension and suspense, but also has action and is full of emotion.What makes this film so good is that i have never seen anything like it. It wasn't predictable at all, but it also wasn't so unpredictable that story line just became hard to follow and unrealistic. This film could have easily been based on a true story, which is why it was so engaging.The acting in this film was phenomenal, especially Hugh Jackman's performance, to the point where at times i forgot that this was just a film. Jake Gyllenhaal who adopted the role of the head detective was also fantastic, as was Paul Dano who portrayed the main suspect. There were only (roughly) 8 main characters; the four parents, the two children who disappeared, the detective, and the main suspect (Alex Jones) but not at any point did I feel there was a lack of detail and continuity. In fact, my only criticism would be that we barely saw the two mothers in the film in comparison to some other characters, but thats just me being picky.I would highly recommend this movie to anybody i know, unless you are not a fan of violence/gore/blood etc as it is fairly prominent throughout. This film is definitely worse watching, and as it is out on DVD tomorrow, i suggest you snatch a copy if you get the chance.",

The darkest depths of human emotions are explored as a worst-case \"what would you do if it were your family\" scenario comes to life. For me, it also called to mind studies on human behavior, in which groups or mobs of humans are proved to be capable of things that go against--in theory--their beliefs or values.

Now the dad, Hugh Jackman, of course he's a great actor and does not disappoint in this movie, but his part was way over the top and he was Einstein compared to the cop, Jake Gyllenhaal. The entire movies was actually about these two and everybody else were just there! My wife's complaint, was mainly everyone spoke to quietly, so it was hard to hear and easy to miss things.

Considering I've met a few retards in my life, I could only imagine how one must feel about interacting with little kids after watching this movie. All games aside. This movie had potential based on the concept. It lacked in every category that you could think of in reviewing a movie. The lead detective has a big Mayan tattoo on his neck, the black family did little to nothing to contribute to finding their child, the mother of the white girl was sedated the entire movie, the white dad was enraged the entire movie and yielded little results after his actions, and the little black girl was obviously the smartest character in the movie.

            "content": "Denis Villeneuve's Prisoners (2013) is an incredibly dark, gritty crime drama. Very much a modern film, it combines realistic\u2013if unusual\u2013plot and characters with morally complex questions and situations. Additionally, the film is layered with symbolism, which presents no problem for a casual viewer, as it can be ignored in favor of plot, though analytical and intellectual viewers will probably enjoy puzzling through the various symbols presented in the film.The premise is simple: two families, with the help of a detective, search for their children, who have disappeared and are believed to have been abducted. The plot, however, grows increasingly complex as the film progresses, though it never becomes muddled or difficult to follow, and the twists and turns never become unrealistic, though they are unexpected. The action of the film mostly centers on Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman), a man whose young daughter has gone missing. The story deals mainly with his desperate search, and many of the moral issues that arise in the film derive from his growing desperation. Also central to the plot is Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal), a man with a mysterious and troubled past who has been assigned to the case. Terrence Howard also stars as the father of the other missing girl. All three turn in excellent performances, and the supporting cast is also excellent, with convincing performances from Viola Davis, Maria Bello, and Paul Dano. David Dastmalchian is also superb in a minor role.Many of the minor aspects of the film were also done very well. It has been nominated for an Oscar in Cinematography, an honor which it well deserves. The somber late-autumn weather provides a striking backdrop for the story, and the bleakness of the imagery complements the overall tone of the film. In addition, the soundtrack is very effective. Very minimalistic, it largely utilizes only strings (occasionally with a solo cello), at times echoing of Arvo Part's Fratres. It too complements the coldly eerie atmosphere.I very much enjoyed this movie (though perhaps enjoyed is not exactly the right word). It is the first film that I consciously thought while watching, \"This might be the best movie I've ever seen\". I'm not sure that it is, nor that it is my favorite, but it's close on both counts. It is, however, by no means an easy movie to watch; the brutality will likely be off-putting to some viewers, and the length and pacing will leave unintelligent or uninterested moviegoers bored. If one is prepared to watch it with an active and attentive mind, however, then Prisoners will be a powerful and intellectually intriguing experience.Highly recommended",

The cast is very good and the plot keeps you guessing to the end, keeping the suspense high. Reminds a bit of a not-much-seen Paul Walker film called Nowhere to Run in places, and in other places Silence of the Lambs. It is better than both though.",

Ultimately the film explores the human mind and shows how far people can be pushed to their breaking points. The dark, moody atmosphere Denis Villeneuve creates fits perfectly with the film.Jake Gyllenhaal and Hugh Jackman transcend among an array of highly skilled performances from the whole supporting cast. Both actors at the pinnacle of their acting powers, career bests for sure. While watching, you really begin to understand and feel for every character. The plot is absorbing and suspenseful. It took me 2 viewings to fully understand the whole story. The little things I missed the first time around makes me admire this film even more. The true testament of a great film in my book. A dark, precise, mysterious, masterpiece with a little violence thrown in means it's a must watch for any thriller fan! In my view, one of the best films of the year!",

            "content": "I was a little hesitant in seeing Prisoners, as when i saw the trailers, i thought straight away that that they gave everything away. Had it shown us what really happened, who the kidnapper was and if any major twists that would ruin the film? Well many people thought so. I had a look on a few forums and websites, and everyone were the same. Had the trailers just ruined the whole premise of the film, well fortunately not. So here I am after watching Prisoners, quite happy that i was proved wrong, and I had just watched an enjoyable albeit a little dragged out crime drama.We're pretty much thrown straight into things. After a small family thanksgiving get together, and a little more booze than initially thought, the dads Keller and Franklin (Hugh Jackman and Terrence Howard) along with mothers Grace and Nancy, (Maria Bello and Viola Davis) relax and wind down with a few games. After allowing their two young daughters to go outside and play about by their home which also has a creepy looking, dirty, dingy, RV camper van near by, it suddenly becomes apparent that their children are missing, and once its noticed that this suspect RV has also gone walkabouts, the conclusion is that their kids have been abducted.This leads to a police hunt led by Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) promising that he will find these kids no matter what. The camper van being the supposed key to everything, has learning impaired Alex Jones at the wheel (played superbly by Paul Dano) all caught up in a story with numerous turns, twists and submissions, that it continuously keeps the viewer guessing whats going on, and who is behind everything that happens in front of their eyes. In the closing stages of the film, its seems all a little rushed in regards to the twist, but if paying enough attention, the audience should clock on with what is happening and have the reveal before the characters. A good few clues are thrown straight in front of our eyes, and I quite liked the fact that we could work this out before the some of the characters, as we were seeing things from a different perspective.Loki, the fathers, and the mothers all go through the emotions, with varying differences in how these families cope with the taking of these girls. Some take the vengeful route, others take matters in to their own hands, and some break down into an emotional wreck, disregarding anything else in the world to them. This is very apparent in the way the mothers deal with this current loss, one very different from the other. Some aspects within the film come across slightly strange, mainly for me, the police side of things and the way Keller acts. There really is only Loki looking for these children, trying to piece together what has happened, and how to solve it. Yes every now and then another police officer is seen, but generally with two girls missing, I would have thought a bigger police presence would have been on the scene. This might be because Loki has some demons of his own that is pushing him towards this case, but still it looked all a bit sparse. Keller on the other hand, when taking action into his own hands, seems so intent on one person, with really nothing to go on at most times, that his actions just seemed out of the blue for who he is and what he did. Yes his child is missing, but what he does, and somehow with complete ease, seems far- fetched in the way he gets away with it, but again that may loop to the lack of police presence, Keller is easily able to do what he wants, when he wants, to try and force answers that he wants to hear, because no one is stopping him.I thought the film would build up the families a bit more, show us who these people are, what they are like, build a relationship with the viewer before the kidnapping took place. But nope, 10-15 mins in and the films major plot begins, the two young children we are briefly introduced to have been taken, and the story starts. We were never really given any real close knit family moments, or any real introduction to the two girls, but if we were shown this, it may may have made Prisoners even darker than it is. Yes the terrible aspect of these two children taken is bad enough here, its strong enough to make the audience greatly care, and the story twists continue to intrigue, but that slight cover from the director, making the viewers not attached to these specific children by name, may have made the emotional absorbing roller-coaster of a story , that little bit easier to watch. However i did enjoy the relationship between Alex Jones and his grandmother. It was well thought out initially, but again would have liked certain parts to have been explained further.The film goes on for over 150 minutes, which at times feels like its dragging, but weirdly enough certain scenes, as like previously said, the reveal, the twist, feels rushed. I enjoyed Prisoners from the off. Some of the characters actions were questionable at the least, but the twists are interesting, and the whole building up to the reveal is done well. Prisoners has a solid story, fantastic acting, and some very emotional tense scenes. Still with a few plot holes here and there in full force once the credits roll you may be left wanting a little more.",

            "content": "Underneath grey skies, Director Denis Villeneuve examines the lengths people will go to for their young ones, and the rationale that might be used to justify what can only be seen as reprehensible acts. Be forewarned this movie contains scenes of brutal violence that should leave you wincing.Gyllenhaal's logical and professional Detective Loki provides an excellent foil for the irrational and illogical behaviour that comes to pass around him as he struggles to solve a missing persons case. And even as he succeeds, those with blind right wing views continue to support their own evil actions through various means including religion. Blindly they cling to their original views with twisted logic and a refusal to accept facts. Inside a situation where bad actions are compounded by more bad actions, Villeneuve also explores the depths and importance of a person's own children. In particular Villeneuve seems interested in how much of a person's life fulfilment is linked to their children's lives. Throughout the film the childless Detective Loki's history and life is never really filled in. Brilliantly though, he is still engaging to the audience, and the subject of children as always increases our emotional involvement. The atmosphere is taut in this film, and punctuated by violence that is made all the more brutal by that tautness. The full 2 1/2 hours is required to follow such a complex descent into people's emotions and the illogical and prejudiced acts that follow when a child's life may be threatened. The plot is as twisting and unpredictable as people's emotions can be, and you may be surprised by the ending.",

I liked how the trailer hinted at Hugh Jackman's character being shown to change in demeanor as a result of his daughter's abduction. In reality, the film took a turn in a different and more extreme direction - one that I wouldn't necessarily say was good.The start of the film played out well, with a realistic and credible scenario. But I found myself throughout the film getting more and more confused and more disinterested as a result. Don't get me wrong: I like films with twists and turns in unexpected directions, but too much so can make me feel a little queasy. I felt like I was spending too much time trying to explain to myself what on earth was going on rather than revelling in the excitement and tension of the actual film. This I found frustrating. Having said that, if you want some thrilling and tense scenes, I think this film provides quite a few. I just think a poor plot can detract from well-acted, tense scenes. In a nutshell, I would describe this film as a lot of twists, quirks and unusual concepts all put together in quick succession; however, they were not really linked. I could barely draw a connection between a lot of what was happening and I found myself drawn into a strange, unexplained plot which overall left me very unsatisfied. And that's, unfortunately, how I would say I felt at the end of the film. Unsatisfied, confused, and after about five minutes of trying to piece what I had just watched together, I realised I didn't really care.",

Prisoners is a film that pushes the boundaries of moralistic values, it crosses a line that we hope to never have to cross in a situation we pray we never have to be in. Keller Dover played by Hugh Jackman (Wolverine, Les Mis\u00e9rables) and his wife Grace played by Maria Bello(Payback, The Secret Window) attend a Thanksgiving dinner at the home of their neighbours Franklin played by Terrence Howard (Iron Man, Hustle & Flow) and Nancy Birch played by Viola Davis (How to get away with murder, The Help). Their 2 young daughters, Anna and Joy go outside to play but never return. An investigation is launched with Detective Loki played by Jake Gyllenhaal (Nightcrawler, Brokeback Mountain)arresting the prime suspect being a young man with the IQ of a ten year old whose RV was spotted where the young girls were last seen. As time drags on and the girls remain missing slowly desperation sets in and Keller decides to take matters into his own hands\u0085. Once again I want to say so much about the plot but if I do I'd be breaking my own rules and giving away so much. The plot is so interesting, I loved it, I loved the way the story in its entirety was played out, and I loved the characters and how well they were played. Hugh Jackman proves once again why he is so sought after in the film industry he was so convincing as the desperate father I'm surprised there was no Oscar buzz about his performance. Not only Hugh though, his fellow cast members were just as engaging and hypnotic. A perfect cast in my opinion. Jake Gyllenhaal (who did win Best Supporting Actor of the Year Award at the 2013 Hollywood Film Festival) was mesmerising with his character as well. The other stand out feature for me though was the cinematography it was amazing and really feel it helped the story teller tell his amazing tale; once again I was extremely impressed by the visuals. I don't really know the director Denis Villeneuve's other works but I can tell he is a man of talent and I'll be looking him up to see what else he has done. Prisoners will leave you feeling desperate and curious, running at a little under 3hrs it does take its toll as well, I'm not sure it really needed to be that long but for the outcome it does work and you hardly notice the time. The film is very disturbing in nature, has some very graphic scenes so not one for the kids. Be prepared for a magical ride with this one it'll have you'll be running a full gauntlet of emotions and I'm so glad to say the twists and turns the film takes throughout only make it so much better.",

Definitely not crutched by bang bang, it's a twisting psychological drama. We are pretty clear that Jackman is going over the top, but he's also right for all the wrong reasons; his victim really does have some answers, and everyone is convincing.Many of the setups are expected but combined with a fresh genre result,\nand there aren't any soft spots, where interest nods off; that is, if you like it,... because if you need 20 gunshots per minute, and that style does have its necessary place, this won't get you off.This not \"Dredd\" or \"Copland\" etc. We are led to believe this one will end on a sad bittersweet note until the last 30 seconds or so, where it's heavily intimated, sledged really, that , the cavalry is gonna come, and while therefore ending on a symmetric Major note resolution, it's the only part that lost some internal plausibility for us, just too coincidental.A very minor point in an otherwise significantly better then usual movie, especially in it's heavily worked genre.",

Both sets of parents struggle to cope as they are left helpless and have to rely on Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) to work on finding their missing daughters.The story starts off a little too rosy and 'happy families.' This is soon over and the atmosphere and tension build up as the families realise their children are missing, presumed kidnapped. The film has a very bleak tone and is initially quite gritty. However, the story soon turns into a Hollywood tale rather than a heart breaking story.'Prisoners' is really a film of two parts; the first is following rule-breaking Detective Loki as he tries to find the girls. His side is quite interesting and doesn't really have any negative aspects to it - it simply is what it is, an investigation. Hugh Jackman plays the father of one of the missing girls; he is understandably frustrated after the suspected kidnapper is let go due to a lack of evidence. He takes the drastic step of kidnapping the suspect and chaining him to a sink in an abandoned house to torture him. This is obviously to make the audience ask themselves the question 'what would I do in that situation?' As the film progresses, things get more and more extreme. It gets to the point where you realise no one in real life would ever do something like this and that is when 'Prisoners' looses its audience. Things just get too silly and unrealistic.Hugh Jackman gives a really good performance but his character's actions become too bizarre. Terrence Howard is really bad which is surprising. He plays the other father and has to cry and be upset in numerous points of the film. He just does not look like he cares at all though - his crying scenes look incredibly forced and unnatural. The two mothers are shown to be useless which is a little disappointing and slightly offensive; Viola Davis could have gave a fantastic and powerful performance here but all her character does is stare into space. Maria Bello lies in bed the whole time because her character becomes depressed but doesn't really revive from it - it would have been good to see her beat the illness. Jake Gyllenhaal gives an admirable performance - although it is quite similar to that in the brilliant 'Zodiac,' he plays an investigator who has never failed to solve a case with his brash approach and his 'f**k-it' attitude. He is the only character in the entire film who isn't one-dimensional. Paul Dano also gives a great performance; he somehow manages to be creepy and seem so innocent at the same time. The film could have focused more on the slow yet inevitable breakdown of the families rather than the endless - and ultimately pointless - scenes of torture. It was briefly mentioned in the beginning that Hugh Jackman's family are struggling financially - this is never mentioned again and it is fairly evidence that Terrence Howard's family are very wealthy. It seemed like such an obvious foreshadow that the two families would end up arguing at some point but they don't. A lot of reviews have questioned the ending, many have found it annoying or weird. It is a strange way to end the film but, in context it is the most positive ending possible.Overall, 'Prisoners' is quite disappointing; the story is unnecessarily complicated and becomes ridiculous. Most of the performances are good - particularly the leads. For a film like this you would expect there to be some really harrowing points - there were hardly any.",

But then... towards the end, my wife and I both coincidentally realized: 1) This was a very long movie, and some scenes didn't need to be there, while, 2) the movie skipped past some things it could have explored a bit more 3) I felt the ending left us hanging. It was a bit like a recent Steven King novel... enjoyable as hell but then the loose ends just sort of flop away at the end and leave it to you to work out in your own head. The moral of this story is very unclear. Yet... paradoxically... that's also what I like about this movie. It makes me think about justice, and what can happen when we take it into our own hands. Things that seem so clear can be so murky. The major twist at the end of this movie could have been handled better (the connection between the missing boy and the presumed kidnapper of the girls)- it was almost an afterthought. My other complaint was the bizarre way the movie DROPPED the scene where Gyllenhaal discovers Jackman torturing the boy... WHY was this scene CUT, then Jackman is free, but then... arggg. Just a frustrating ending. I half respect that, but half of me feels it was manipulative and poorly handled. This is a hard movie to review. I'm left with a movie I can recommend, but one that is almost as frustrating as it is engaging.",

            "content": "The film Prisoners from the outside looked like any other kidnapped story such at Taken, however it was much more than that. Prisoners had an unbelievable cast to make the story become a reality, and kept the audience on the edge of their seats for the entirety of the film. I have read several reviews on this film that have stated that the film was predictable and boring, I am going to have to respecfully disagree in that regard. This film had so many twists and turns, I have no idea how anyone could have guessed the outcome from the very beginning. The film started as a very feel good film in my opinion, with the Dovers, and the Birches sharing the Thanksgiving Holiday together. Neighbors, and very good friends it made the viewer (me at least) feel at ease, and happy for the two families. I feel that these scenes really made the story more believable and made you feel more for the two families who would later have their daughters abducted. That is one reason in my opinion that made this film so suspenseful, and made the crowd root for Keller Dover(Hugh Jackman) to find his daughter, and the daughter of his great friend and neighbor Franklin Birch (Terrance Howard). The the fathers Mr. Dover, and Mr. Birch really showed, and portrayed the emotions of a struggling father who is worried sick about his daughter. They really show the length in which a father would go to save his daughter, and that he would put his own life on the line. Hugh Jackman, and Terrance Howard both did a great job at expressing those emotions. One went to more extremes than the other but, both showed what they would do to assure their daughters would come home safely. The wives played by Maria Bello and Viola Davis also did a great and convincing job of the struggles that a mother would experience in those conditions. Maria Bello played the wife of Keller Dover named Grace Dover. She really portrayed a struggling mother by turning to prescription drugs, and many freakouts about her baby girl who she wasn't sure was dead or alive. Mrs. Birch played by Viola Davis was emotional but strong. She pertook in the torturing of Alex Jones played by Paul Dano. The torturing was started by Keller Dover, who forced Frankilin Birch to partake. He later broke down and told his wife he later went and tried to get answers from Alex Jones who was assumed to have taken the two young girls. The siblings of the two young girls were also very well played. It showed that a older brother Ralph Dover, and older sister Birch were forced to grow up through the experience, and help in the investigation of the abduction of their younger siblings. Now, lets get away from the families and talk about Detective Loki played by Jake Gyllenhaal. I saw that one opinion stated that they were always one or two steps ahead of him in the investigation of the abduction. I think that, that is irrelevant while talking about the film, people watch movies and think about it differently. I believe that the actions, and investigating that Det. Loki took made sense, and is somewhat realistic, except for the amount of time it took to make the discovery. Jake Gyllenhaal did an amazing job playing a detective who is all business in the beginning of the investigation and then becomes emotionally invested in the discovery of the two abducted girls. I think that his seriousness and attention to detail during his investigation was very professional, and realistic. Becoming emotionally involved with a family who is missing a loved one is very easy to do, and he did a great job of showing that. In the end he found the two girls, however the movie ends without Keller Dover the rest of what happens is up the the viewers imagination. This is a great film, and great role played by Hugh Jackman, and the entire cast. They made the film come to life for me, and has been the best movie I have seen this year. My congratulations goes out to the cast, and crew of this film.",

The problems began when plot twist seem to be written in for the sake of shock value, and we're not believable. The motive of the abductions and or killings was so convoluted it seemed silly, and all the psychological tension that had been built up was lost the more motive was revealed.\nI found the depiction of mental illness in one of the victims, Bob, insulting and unrealistic, and utterly cliched.\nYet despite all this, still very compelling to watch well directed (if not written), and still explored many issues of moral ambiguity.",

A detective (Jake Gyllenhaal) hunts down several people and does everything he can to solve the case. Meanwhile, one of the girl's fathers (Hugh Jackman) decides to take matters into his own hands. Prisoners is such an incredibly made movie; each shot is diligently crafted, each piece of dialogue is captivating and dramatic. The atmosphere is very dark, gloomy, and creepy. It is almost like that of a horror movie. For example, the use of differed weather is used in may scenes. Rain, snow, hail, wind, etc., is used to create a specific mood for each scene and setting. The characters are well-developed and interesting. In fact there are many character traits that have nothing to do with the story; they are there simply for background. The acting is amazing. Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Paul Dano, and all the supporting actors give great performances. The movie is very suspenseful and sucks you into the story within the first ten minutes. That being said, despite the two and a half hour run-time, I was not bored for one second! The entire movie has a pervasive feeling of dread and unpleasantness. The entire thing is very emotionally disturbing, depressing, and hard to watch. For that reason not all audiences will enjoy this movie, but for people looking for an intense and suspenseful thriller, Prisoners is perfect for you. I also LOVED the ending.

The supporting cast is great, well maybe minus Maria Bello with her fake crying, and the production quality is superb with the tight editing, good flow and buildup to suspense. All of these outstanding elements in this movie enable me to overlook some pet peeves, specifically the contrived moments used to push the plot along, and there are quite a few.",

            "content": "After watching this movie and then gone through the reviews-section (because I wanted to write one, (that would be my first one as well)), I was utterly convinced with whatever \"law-turley\" (An IMDb User) wrote, and I entirely borrowed the contents from him/her. Here is how, slightly modified review goes from my side: The first 30 minutes or so of the movie were really promising. I liked the set-up of the 2 cozy families in their suburban idyll sharing a thanksgiving meal and discovering, to their horror, their kids had somehow gone missing. That part felt very real, very \"based on a true story\". As the film went on though, the clunky writing and flabby storytelling started to show its effects.#1. My first big problem came with the utterly implausible discovery of the body in the pedophile priest's basement. First of all, Gyllenhaal's decision to move the freezer based on the flex being dangerously stretched, just seemed...dumb. Why would he care if the guy stretches his flex? It didn't seem from his reaction (\"drunks!\") that he thought the freezer was hiding something, and yet he opts to shove the big heavy thing closer to the socket because presumably it bothers him. Then - whoa - there's a door there, and whoa it's a big cellar (which is not that weird really), and now - whoa - look a body! #2. And next came a great big WHY? He's a pedophile catholic priest so why was he SO outraged that a man might kill kids. He abuses children but is still so horrified by a killer that he opts to kill the guy who's (again...utterly improbably) has come to him for confession, but not so horrified that he tells ANYONE the guy's story? Or attempts to find out if it's true before he offs him? Instead he just stuffs the body in the basement and drinks a lot. Hmm!!! #3. My next problem was the biggest and clumsiest of the plot points. Gyllenhaal finds a body and hears a weird-ass tale about child murders (and presumably there's a not a lot of those locally), but despite his incredible intellect and ability to make connections, he doesn't spot the REALLY ODD MAZE NECKLACE on the body until the drawing falls conveniently from his desk alongside it, and make the connection between the two.#4. Why is escaped and presumably traumatized kidnap victim Bob stealing children's clothes, covering them in pig's blood and putting them in boxes full of snakes? It would make sense if he was somehow part of the cover-up, or working for Alex's aunt, but he's not. So for some reason known only to himself he's stealing clothes and making it seem like Anna and Joy are dead when they're not. Presumably because he's traumatized. Or just mental. But either way, it's not really explained, it's just a great big red herring that confuses everything.#5. What is the significance of Keller's dad's suicide? Because if there is no significance, why show Loki reading about it as if it's important? Presumably (again) it's so he can find out that the building that Keller's going to is where his dad died - but so what? Why is it important, other than to cloud the waters and confuse the audience even more. Was Keller connected to his father's suicide, why was no note found...all questions we have no need to ask.#6. WTF is this all maze rubbish? Right from the poster we're led to expect some kind of maze to appear. The serial killer wears a necklace with a maze on it, Alex says \"they're in the maze\", Bob is obsessed with drawing mazes, so where's the freaking maze man? When Holly gets Keller to back the car up we think \"FINALLY! HERE'S THE MAZE!!! But there's no maze down there, just a big deep hole full of old sneakers and dead snakes. No maze, not even a sniff of one. The only maze-related thing as it turns out, is a puzzle book that Leo forces the kids to do while they're kidnapped, presumably traumatizing them with their inability to solve simple puzzles. It might just as well have been Sudoku really, but that might have looked weird on a necklace...#7. And finally, the pointless sub-plot. Just WHAT is the purpose and meaning behind Keller's kidnap and torture of Alex? It has no real purpose other than to provide a weirdly amoral counterpoint to the other story (which would have been so much better emphasized if we'd seen anything of the girls' captivity), and leaves us confused and kind of weirdly angry with the guy. Alex is an innocent child and Keller has tortured him almost to death, so what does that make him? A villain? An anti-hero? A misguided vigilante? No-one seems to care if we know, so we end up drawing no conclusion at all and Keller ends up as a shapeless figure that we ultimately care little about.#8. Despite all aforementioned loop-holes, The END comes abrupt and it starts reeling credits all of a sudden. This point was the obvious limit of tolerance to leave the audience bewildered.Ultimately my feeling was that this could have been a \"good\" film, if only someone had applied due experience and a keen eye had been brought in to work on the script and iron out the many (mentioned) flaws. The cinematography and the score was great, and it's a testament to the director and actors (TRULY, I give them credit) that the movie was still highly watchable despite the glaring plot holes and confusing storytelling, but on the whole it was a disappointing and lacking experience and not one I'd highly recommend...",

The first few scenes are contrived..but then it ropes you in. The cinematography is gritty and grainy, and not a film for kids. It is pretty brutal in places but not gratuitous. This is a film worth seeing, with the tension of the film \"Ransom\" If you like movies that keep you guessing and wondering what happens next this is for you. The director seems to really know where to put the camera to make you feel like you are there. Gyllenhall gives a troubled performance worthy to see. Jackman at times seems wooden, and tries very hard to go to places to make you feel for him. Viola Davis is always good, and the few moments she has you feel for her as well.

Those truly unforgettable movies that are just plain special. Not only is this movie not 'special', it has more holes than a block of swiss cheese. 1) A guy sees a refrigerator with a long cord and the first thing that comes to mind is a secret door behind it??? Ridiculous.... 2) If this 'mentally challenged' suspect is in fact just a victim and not involved, why did he whisper something to the child's father like he was involved, when in the end he wasn't? 3) When the father is drugged and told to back the Trans Am up under gun point with the door is wide open, why doesn't he just step on the gas, collect the sick woman in the open door like a net, and run her over????? 4) If the woman was in fact worried about the police 'sniffing' around her house, WHY would she take the children out of the hole in the ground WHERE NO ONE COULD POSSIBLY KNOW THEY WERE, and put in a bedroom where they could easily escape and were one was eventually found by the detective?? 5) If this woman was so intent on keeping all of this a secret, why would she ALL OF A SUDDEN decide to throw in the towel and get caught red handed when the detective showed up at her house for an unrelated matter? 6) After the police departments 'forensic' team goes through the motor home, WHY is it they find no trace of the girls (when in fact that WAS the vehicle used in the kidnapping), nor they do not find any trace of that psychopath woman (which also turned out was in the RV)?? 7) Why bring this 'copy-cat' kidnapper into the movie??? Why?? He buys children's clothes from the store and breaks into the kidnapped kids houses and steals their clothes? They could have shaved 30 minutes off this overly-long movie just by keeping this unnecessary character out of the movie completely and spent that time fixing the laundry list of inconsistencies....8) How is the main characters former addiction to alcohol necessary ANYWHERE in the film?? Just another one of many distractions to keep the holes in this movie camouflaged. This is just a sign of modern day movies which fail to deliver, and the forgiving audiences that don't care that a film if full of inconsistencies and still think it is somehow it is worthy of 'film of the year'?? I've also learned that a IMDb rating of over an 8 doesn't really mean much anymore. I could go on and on and on with examples on how this movie fell apart...... Lots of suspense & had potential if someone had actually taken the time to fix the storyline. It had the basic ingredients to be a GREAT film! Very little in this movie adds up.

I didn't spoil anything so you can enjoy Prisoners without any big clues about scenario. Why 9 stars instead of 10? I can't tell, that'd be a spoiler. Also I liked the tension I had watching this movie. It wasn't very strong, but strong enough to keep watching the movie. I'm young so I haven't seen many movies in my life, but this is movie I can truly rate with 9 stars from 10. Have fun watching Prisoners!",

Another interesting feature of this film is that it simultaneously gives enough answers/resolution to satisfy the audience, but leaves plenty of ambiguous details which are fun to discuss afterwards.",

This one has you from start to finish forcing you to examine your own views and the lengths that you would go to placed in that situation. The entire movie has no sunshine. It's cold, wet and miserable. I think that's just to give the characters a little more texture though. Go see it if you want an edge of your seat thriller on a Sunday afternoon.

And despite the massive runtime, it doesn't lag too badly.I wanted to love Hugh Jackman's performance as the father, but he basically has 2 emotions in the entire film. Angry, sad, then angry again. Not that he doesn't do those two emotions well, but it's not enough. Gyllenhaal is fine as the detective, and I was pleasantly surprised by Terrence Howard as Franklin. For a movie that seemed ideal for great acting roles, the portrayals are only decent to good.The best part of the movie are the twists and turns of the mystery and how it is revealed and comes together. The imagery of the maze is an interesting motif and is used very well. I am honestly a little upset with the movie for how neatly it is all explained by the end. There is no room for ambiguity. The movie does a good job keeping us in the dark and guessing for at least 2 hours of its 2 hour 30 minute runtime. I wish it had ended with at least a little of the mystery that made it worth watching.Had I never seen Mystic River (2003) I probably would have liked Prisoners a little more. It's a good mystery, but I was a little let down by the acting and a little let down by the ending. Good movie, I'd recommend it, but I'd actually recommend Mystic River more.",

I've been making my way through Denis Villeneuve' filmography so I was expecting a lot, and I was not disappointed.Something that I really appreciate about prisoners is the extra effort that went in to make the situation feel realistic. Some scenes don't feel realistic but the way children are abducted feels pretty real and I actually found the subject matter quite disturbing. I was lying in bed the night after seeing it and thinking about something like that happening to a family member or friend, and that really got to me. This isn't a criticism by the way, I love that this film got this reaction out of me. I don't react like this to many movies so when it happens I like to savour the moment.The acting is mostly great, Hugh Jackman and Melissa Leo stole every scene they were in and the children actually acted like children. Unsurprisingly Jake Gyllenhaal is great, his character was reminiscent of L from death note at times. Surprisingly Dylan Minnette who's dreadful in 13 reasons why is also great.Unfortunately I saw a twist involving a certain character coming when I was about half way through, but the twist wasn't meant to blow the audience away like a bad M. Night movie. Having an idea about what was going to happen didn't ruin the movie for me though, obviously I still loved it.Roger Deakins is the director of photography so obviously the film looks stunning. I also really loved the ending of the film, and I thought it was hilarious that Paul Dano's character was named Alex Jones.During a pretty shocking scene a couple of the punches thrown look laughably fake and Terrence Howard made some funny faces when showing emotion, other than this I don't really have many complaints.Overall I loved prisoners. It's accessible to most everyone so check it out if you haven't already.",

            "content": "Slow burn thrillers are a dying breed. Most modern suspense films go in for gruesome and violent stories of murder to send chills down spines of the audience. A lot of this pictures offer mysteries that are not too difficult to decipher. So it is a great pleasure to discover that there filmmakers out there adventurous enough to craft a dark, intriguing dialogue driven motion picture that keeps the audience guessing for most its runtime. That director Denis Villeneuve does so with panache and some wonderfully orchestrated darkness is what elevates the material beyond escapist territory. The story is set in a Philadelphia suburb where two families the Dovers; Keller (Hugh Jackman) and Grace (Maria Bello) and the Birches, Franklin (Terence Howard) and Nancy (Viola Davis) are celebrating Thanksgiving together. The parents are enjoying themselves indoors while the two young girls decide to go out and play. After a certain amount of time, the parents realise that the two have not returned. After some frantic reconnoitering it is decided that the police need to be called in and the case is assigned to Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal). A few preliminary investigations lead him to a suspect Alex Jones (Paul Dano), but subsequent interrogations reveal that he lacks the intellect and the malevolence that is expected from one who has committed such a crime. He is eventually released much to the chagrin of Keller who is convinced that Jones is involved in the girls' disappearance. Filled with righteous indignation he decides that he will take matters into his own hands. While an engaging whodunit is all that is expected from a picture like this one, it is quite amazing to see how Prisoners not only aspires to be something more than just a by-the-numbers thriller. The original script by Aaron Guzikowski is an intelligent creation with some really astute observations about human nature. Difficult themes like anger, redemption, guilt, punishment and even religion find a home in this dark and at times depressing story. The film's rather chunky 153 minute runtime and the slow, deliberate pace which the story progresses gives the characters and their emotions a lot of breathing space. Though there were occasions when I found myself questioning the persistence of the director in allowing certain scenes to carry on even when their purpose in the narrative has been realised. To be fair these moments are few and far between which is why they tend to stick out. It is not possible to fully discuss the emotional weight of the story without divulging the specifics of the plot but suffice to say that the script is never guilty of feeding the audience any answers and the resolution is satisfying and I personally could not guess it beforehand. The excellent direction allows the story to be engaging at all times. The cautious building up of suspense, the natural dialogue, and the nuanced presentation are top notch and there are times when I could detect echoes of David Fincher's modern classic Zodiac (2007) that are only amplified by the involvement of Jake Gyllenhaal. That is not to say Prisoners takes cues visual cues from Zodiac. It is its own beast, but is in several ways a spiritual companion of that picture. Prisoners would not have been anywhere close to being as effective, if it wasn't for the stellar cinematography of Roger Deakins. Deakins has long been acknowledged as one of the leading exponents of his craft and here his lens work enriches (if not outright create) the creepy atmosphere that film exudes. The way the camera pans and zooms; it could be argued that Deakins' camera is a character in itself. The music in contrast comes across as merely adequate, but is never overbearing and does not take the viewer out of the moment. The emotional crux is purely dependent on the performances and in that department there is nary a complaint I can make. Five members of the main cast have Academy Award nominations and everyone plays their respective roles with great conviction. Jake Gyllenhaal has built up an impressive resume over the years and this movie adds another feather to his cap. His detective Loki is reserved yet determined and the actor brings the right amount of dedication to his role. Though, he does tend to overplay one conspicuous tick that the character displays. Hugh Jackman's portrayal of the indignant, conflicted father who is willing to do whatever it takes to find his daughter is a highlight of the film. Long has the actor been under the shadow of his famous Superhero avatar. Liberated from formula he displays his talent with incredible force. Terence Howard, Viola Davis and Mario Bello do not have roles that are as hefty but they provide solid support. Paul Dano brings a lot vulnerability to Alex and his mannerisms and dialogue delivery make his mental defects seem believable. A quiet dialogue driven piece such as this one has the potential of falling into indulgence. But, prisoners never falls prey to that. There are times when the script slows down the proceedings but it is only to allow the audience a better view of the characters and their lives. Nevertheless, there is a significant of portion of the mainstream audience that may find this a little too dark and languid. But, for those who are patient enough to follow the director to the places he takes us in this picture the rewards are delectable, providing a cinematic experience that is rich, multi-layered and most of very memorable.",

Yeah, that needed to be two hours long, let alone over two hours. It's just completely unnecessary, especially when you don't have the material and intrigue to fill it up. If it had been shorter and more concise, I think it would've improved the pacing, largely increased the thrill, and maybe not given the audience quite so much time to realize how kind of unoriginal and predictable it really was. I saw almost every twist as it came, and I almost never say that about a movie. In fact, while watching I try to just be present and not presumptuous so knowing what was coming is not something I try to do. Also the acting all around was quite good. The dad did a good job but it was grating almost to the point of unenjoyable. Almost 2 1/2 hours of listening to him rage became a bit taxing and one note.Regardless of these, to me, detrimental issues... As stated, this was still enjoyable and entertaining.

Bound to keep you on the edge of your seat, the thriller is one to keep you guessing, emphasising the frustration of uncertainty. Jake Gyllenhaal stars as an assertive and confrontational detective, the best in the department, portraying his role perfectly. Similarly, Hugh Jackman captures the emotions caused by the loss of a loved one, and how ultimately it can lead you to becoming a bad person. Set in a cold Pennsylvania, Keller (Jackman) and Grace Dover along with their two children Anna and Ralph, celebrate thanksgiving at Franklin and Nancy Birch's home, the pair also have two children; Joy and Eliza. Embracing the cheerful period, the families are seen playing games and sharing a meal. The four children walk through the neighbourhood, and come across an old RV, after realising there is someone inside, the girls stop playing on it and are made to head home by Eliza and Ralph. Later, the parents can't find Joy and Anna, assuming they are missing, Grace calls the police, informing them about the rugged RV Ralph had explained about. Detective Loki (Gyllenhaal) is pictured in a desolate food hall, before receiving the news. He quickly identifies the RV and obtains an awkward looking man who attempted to flee. During interrogation, the man, named Alex, possesses an extremely low IQ, proving that the ability to kidnap and hide two young children is unlikely one of his capabilities. The RV is searched, and no forensic evidence is found. Furious, Hugh Jackman's character approaches Loki, convinced that Alex is to blame. Keller then challenges Alex by the police station, threatening him over a car bonnet, the scared individual responds by whispering to Keller \"they didn't cry until I left them\". Keller reports the statement to Loki and his chief, but because there is no real proof he said it, they can't take further action. Keller slowly watches Alex at night from a distance, the character appears to be taking his dog out for a walk, but strangely strangles it for a few seconds then returns it to the ground. Creepily, he echoes a song sang by the two girls at the dinner party to himself, causing Dover to square up to him once again. Jackman's character takes Alex to an abandoned building that his father left for him, imprisoning the suspect and abusing him until he tells him where the girls are. Loki tracks down all the local peodophiles in the area and enters the home of a drunken Priest, Father Patrick Dunn, gingerly the detective enters Dunn's basement and finds a corpse with a unique necklace around its neck. During questioning, the Priest admits to killing the man, only because he confessed to murdering 16 children. Loki then speaks with a woman, who's son was taking from her 20 years ago. At a memorial get-together to raise awareness of the missing girls, Loki identifies a suspicious character who runs away as soon as he is spotted by the detective, after an intense chase, the dubious figure escaped. Loki drew an image of the suspect and after it was placed on the news, a store clerk claimed he comes to the store every week to buy children's clothes. Named Bob Taylor, the character is seen breaking into the Dover's and Birch's home, before swiftly leaving. Grace is woken by a noice she hears from Anna's room, convinced it was her she calls the police, Loki arrives and spots her medication in abundance, assuming that she is psychologically unstable. Loki understands that Keller isn't home at night, and the next day follows him to the abandoned building, Keller then spots Loki and suggests he should be looking for his daughter rather than following him. Loki appears again at the building but this time Dover is torturing Alex, Keller then lies on the first floor and acts as if it is a place to hide his alcohol problems from his wife. Loki receives a call from the clerk alerting him that Bob had just left the store and she was able to see his registration plate. The detective shows up at the suspect's house and instantly arrests him, Loki is met by a room full of locked boxes obtaining snakes and bloodstained children's clothes. The house walls are covered in sketches of maze's, supposedly leading to dead body's. Paranoid, Taylor is made to sketch and explain the maze in custody, the agitated and frustrated detective approaches him aggressively after taking too long, causing two other cops to control Loki, Taylor then grabs an officer's gun in the commotion and kills himself before the location of the girls is admitted. Loki calls in the Birch's and Keller to show them the photos of clothing found at Taylor's home. They confirm that some pictures match the girl's clothing. Livid, Dover blames Loki for the death of his daughter. Alex mutters to Dover about escaping a maze, but struggles to talk further, forcing Keller to torture him more. Keller arrives at the home of Holly, Alex's aunt, to apologise for her nephew's disappearance. She explains that his speech disability comes from a childhood accident involving her husband's snakes and that adopting Alex was a way to cope with the death of their son. After finding child manikins buried by Taylor's house, Loki looks for footprints by the window left open in Grace's room during their possible breaking - not only does the detective find footprints, but also the pairing sock said to be Anna's and pictured bloodstained. Loki realises that Taylor isn't the killer and that the girls may well be still alive. Joy is found and situated in hospital, Keller asks her where Anna is and she responds by telling him that \"he was there\". Keller rushes out of the hospital, barging past Loki and his men. Jake Gyllenhaal' character follows but loses him, and turns up at the abandoned building only to find a tortured, battered and bruised Alex. Instead, the protagonist arrives again at Holly's home to \"talk\", she soon puts a gun to him and explains that all Alex wanted to do was take the girls for a ride in his RV, but it was her who demanded they stayed. Holly supports her abduction by stating it is a part of the war against god, for taking away her only child. She then locks Keller into a dark underground mine after shooting him in the leg and mentions sinisterly that she hopes he is still alive when he throws his daughter's dead body down there. Keller looks around the confined space, finding the red whistle that Anna once gave to him. The police manage to relocate Alex to his real parents, following his disappearance that was mentioned earlier in the film. In the act of informing Holly about the findings of her \"nephew\", Loki arrives at the site where Keller is situated. He enters Holly's home subtly and assumes nobody is home, he spots a photo where Holly and her husband are pictured, her husband appears to wear the same necklace as the man in the priests basement and on it the maze that Taylor sketched; he slowly approaches Holly attempting to drug and kill Anna, they both shoot each other, Loki is wounded and kills Holly. The detective takes the weakened child and rushes to the hospital; the combination of blood covering his right eye and torrential rain, the drive is destined to end fatally, but, exemplifying his high-profile, Loki is able to hand Anna over to the medics and have her fixed up. The following morning, Grace and Anna visit the injured Loki, who admits when Keller is found it is most likely he will go to jail. Whilst watching the EGT officers search the banded premises of Holly's home, Loki sees them off, and, while gazing into the distance, he hears a faint whistle from a distance. The gloomy and dark surroundings personify the disappearing mystery. Jake Gyllenhaal's performance is exquisite , mastering the characters professionalism mixing with aggravation. The moving story ends brilliantly yet annoyingly, supposedly allowing viewers to make up there own ending. In honest truth it makes sense that the focus of the film was achieved in finding Anna, and for Hugh Jackman's character to also be rescued, but arrested, may take light off what is really significant.",

None of the main characters is even remotely plausible.--SPOILERS from here on --\nlets start with two well educated little girls who went into a trailer with a mentally challenged man/boy. Why would they do this?This boy who was abducted by his \"foster parents\" was in police custody and interrogated for days without saying anything, although he knew were the girls were and has no reason to protect his and the girls abductor. Later he even gets tortured, which btw is just another unbelievable stupid line of action, and yet he still doesn't say anything. The trailer had no traces of the girls, although they were in it just a day before...how should that be possible? Then there is this other guy who somehow knows whats going on and kind of replays the action, but is otherwise innocent and also says nothing, just kills himself instead.. then the father goes to the house of the abductor when he finally knows where his girl is and instead of immediately overwhelming her (he could have also just told the police) walks into the house and turns his back to her and waits till she pulls a gun.... and then the end... he blows the whistle when he was still strong and nobody heard him, also the place would have been crawling with police and police dogs after they found out, but days or a week later, when barely alive the detective hears the faint whistling...\nhow in gods name can this movie have such high ratings???",

The director tried to make the environment for suspense and thrill but failed to do so, except for the last 10 minutes, which I do not count with 2 and a half hour.The acting however is bit better, thanks to Huge Jackman and Terrence Howard. The movie has its ups and downs but as you slide down your seat, you have to wake up to catch up the sudden scene.So, my recommendation, if you want to waste some of your time or want to get frustrated, be my guest.",

            "content": "The only reason I give this movie 3 instead of one star is that acting wasn't bad. Acting alone however cannot make up for a totally stupid plot. There were so many inconsistencies in this movie that I don't know where to start. First, the movie seems to tell about the worst detective on planet Earth. He always goes alone to places where he can expect danger. He doesn't have the ability to interrogate people properly and do research - i.e. when he finds a dead body in the priest's cellar, he doesn't even take the time to interview the priest properly. The priest tries to tell him that the killer had a family, etc. but the detective just looks bored and thinks of a way to leave the room immediately. Even though in the beginning they arrest a guy under the suspicion of having a connection with the disappearance of the girls, they never bother to do a search of his house (we later find out the girls had been there all along). Also, although ALex is officially a suspect, they never make any checks on him, nor do they check his aunt's version of who he is. As it turns out later, her version is completely made up. well, if he is just one of the boys they kidnapped a long time ago, how did he even have identity papers, driving license, etc. How come the police never checks? The maze maps, Alex's words that the girls are in the maze, all leaves the impression that these maps will actually relate in some way to an actual physical place; however, the girls are simply in the aunt's house and apparently the countless mazes appearing in the film lead only to a medallion the uncle had. Also, Alex is portrayed as almost unable to talk but on the other hand when he speaks he does so perfectly coherently. The snakes are ridiculous. I could go on forever but just don't have the energy after all the time I lost watching this film! What shocks me the most is the high result this movie has on IMDb and the hype in the comments. Absolutely undeserved!!!",

But when two girls go missing the tension slowly builds leaving the audience wondering without actually seeing what happened to the girls, so the audience identifies with the characters as the clues unfold. And the opening of the film has many obvious religious symbols and references that foreshadow some later reveals, but it doesn't become heavy-handed.With perfect casting the mystery unfolds and eventually the true perpetrators are revealed with a well-written and satisfying conclusion. The film actually operates at least partially as a comment on morality, how far is it really okay to go in order to find kidnapped victims and in the final act it also is a meditation on what it means to believe in God or not, especially for the fully committed believer. In the Bible Abraham was asked by God to sacrifice his son, but is that really a reasonable thing to accept as a test from a God? What if God mercilessly and pointlessly took your child? What possibly lesson is there to be learned from such torment?Or maybe there is no ghost in the sky and the universe is just indifferent. Great film from a stellar filmmaker, Denis Villeneuve. If you liked Arrival and Sicario, then you'll enjoy this. Highly recommended.",

However he wasn't a fraction as good as Hugh Jackman who had me on the edge of my seat throughout the entire film. Although he played the enemy, i really sympathised with Paul Dano. I've only ever seen him in one other film (Knight and Day) but i thought he was also a great addition to the cast. Although the cast was good, i would have liked to see a little more from the mother (Maria Bello). I found the ending predictable although i never had a clue who the kidnapper was right up until the last moments.

Questions like, why the child was kidnapped, what happened to Hugh Jackman afterwards, were still left unanswered after the movie ended. It needed answers, and this is why the ending was sad too. The movie was very long and I wouldn't have mind watching another half hour for these answers. It did build up lots of suspense, but I also feel that they added parts that had no need to be in the film, just over elongated the film.

The presence of Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal doesn't interrupt at any time as they manage to develop highly believable characters in a dark and depressing yet fascinating setting. You might think that the story maybe isn't redefining the wheel, but it's told in such a deep and awfully calm way that you won't find any reasons to question it at all. It's power lies in dealing with natural human fears, which we probably never will be truly able to withstand. I don't like reviews getting too much into detail, as to my mind nearly every trailer does, so summing it up I would highly recommend this movie to everyone who likes suspense best served subliminal, such as in Mystic River, I Saw the Devil or The Hunt.",

Alex, how did he get involved with this - Not explained\n2. The guy who killed himself at police station - how did he get involved - Not explained\n3. The black kid who said \"you were there\", - thought it was total mystery, but not explained\n4. All of a sudden the woman held a gun and revealed herself - the movie was long enough, and had sharp turn at almost at the end to end so called mystery, but it is mystery to me.Overall, I like the acting, but not the story",

A bereft father who has lost his daughter to the unacceptable, who is determined to find the solution, no matter what. A role played to absolute perfection and I believed every minute of the father's personal plight, including the lengths he would go through in utter disbelief and grief. In fact, the entire cast is fantastic in Prisoners.I particularly enjoyed the sinister, slow moving and bleak element of this movie, including the lack of realistic hope of saving the girls.However, there are a number of things that I would change if I could make a Director's cut, such as explanation of how one of the girls managed to escape the house, which seemed to more convenient than anything else, and the implausibility (or even the need) to shoot the father in the leg before condemning him to the car pit. He \"might survive 24 hours\" before losing too much blood and certainly won't survive more than three days (without water), but was ultimately found alive, which marred the ending a bit.But Prisoners is a really good watch in a misery-inducing enjoyable sort of way, which I appreciate much more than any minor niggles I may have.",

However, as it turns out, it is a very good movie with a really good script and excellent performance from Gyllenhall.The plot was good, the suspense part does work and it fits the classification of an intense thriller.I went to the cinema this time really just to accompany my wife who really loves Jake Gyllenhall. I ended up liking it too and recommended it to my friends. I was gripped by it. In this movie, I felt so sorry for how low Jackman went. I could almost feel the desperation that he in felt in Prisoners and almost actually felt an empathy; I mean this sort of thing happens regularly all over the world, but he just desisted to take things into his own hands.Overall a very good movie. Go watch it if you haven't.",

Sad that we live in a world where this king of sick demented abductions take place. You will likely remember from time to time this is a fictional story and a crime thriller due to the puzzles and implausibilities they throw at you from time to time, but it's pretty engrossing and, although lengthy (like this sentence), it moves quickly. The cold rain so persistent in this film makes you want to take a hot shower and move to Key West, but the allusion is not lost.

The lead actors in particular had great opportunities to show their skills. Unfortunately Viola Davis wasn't one of them. So definitely don't watch this if you want to see a movie with her acting on display.In the end I wish the pacing was a bit faster and that a bit more of the story was engaging. I had trouble understanding the motivation of the villain. I didn't like the way they left one character' situation precarious in the end.In the end I don't agree with the 8.1 out of 10 rating.

            "content": "It was the powerful performances coming from Hugh Jackman & Jake Gyllenhaal!!! REALLY, you guys...(NOTE: I watched this film, simply because I was curious, like any other movie buff. I usually don't like movies with violence or swearing. And I don't like when any favorite celebrity of mine curses or swears, but perhaps that's just me.)The fact is, it's hard to make a good film. But this... This is officially the best non-X-men-related Hugh Jackman film I've seen! I admit, the man is talented & gifted. (I'm not a fan of the X-Men franchise, for certain reasons. I.E. unscientific Darwinian evolution) (No, I didn't really like \"Les Miserables\" - I still think Liam Neeson was the better 'Jean Valjean'; this film's also better than \"The Prestige\").Back to the subject matter, this is a film that definitely WAS suspenseful! From BEGINNING to END, I was hooked! Thrilling & mysterious at the same time! The acting, GREAT - Hugh Jackman, WOW. And the tension...oh my word!! I especially love the story line of black and white families fellow shipping together - I've had quite a bit of that experience myself. I think it's great, cute, charming, worthwhile, & helps anyone develop as a person . Seriously, this film had me GUESSING and GUESSING. The entire time! Wondering who was where, who did what, what happened, etc,.I LOVE films that do that! It's a bummer you can't erase your memory of all the revealed plot twists & the ending; that's when you get the desire to watch the film again with a person who hasn't seen it before. REALLY well-directed film, I'm betting it's going to stay in my mind for a long time!Conclusively, Paul Dano is one actor I really don't like; but it was a smart move to include him in this flick; they turned him into a socially awkward & weird character, to get beat up and all - that kind of relieved my negative feelings toward him. (I mean, he was *annoying* in \"The Girl Next Door\", \"There Will Be Blood\" and \"12 Years a Slave\" - some films of which I don't really like.)Jake Gyllenhaal's cop character is pretty cool in this film; he and Jackman share great on-screen chemistry together! MUCH BETTER than that horrible \"End of Watch\" film, a worthless pile of nothing, with rancorous dialogue, & all-round cantankerous characters you didn't even care about! Moving way back, I'm a fan of Gyllenhaal, simply because I've got a soft spot for talented Jewish people; a fan of his since watching \"October Sky\", which is a true story.Hugh Jackman's character, even as a father, is so believable (he really rocks the beard! lulz). You could see the intense emotion he develops throughout the film trying to find his daughter & her friend, and the lengths he goes to try to find them! He almost somewhat reminded me of my own Dad! WHY he didn't get nominated for Best Leading Actor, I honestly don't know! Would've been much better than this being Academy-nominated for \"Best Achievement in Cinematography\" (which went to \"Gravity\" for whatever strange reason, when the earth was the background the entire time), or rather than the nomination for Best Actor going to Bruce Dern (an actor I don't really like or care about, nor did I find his performance in \"Nebraska\" the very LEAST interesting, compelling, or memorable!); also, doesn't every film try to have the \"best cinematography\" there is??? Why Academy??? WHY??? What did this film ever do to you!?? Why did you instead even nominate the cast of that horrible & annoying \"American Hustle\" flick!??Hugh Jackam's Oscar nomination should've been for THIS amazing film, instead of \"Les Mis\".But to be fair, the downsides to the film are of course the violence, pervasive cursing, drunkenness, and even the shameful religion of Catholicism being depicted as well, with false idols of the Virgin Mary & talking of priests as \"father\" & all. (Trust me when I say Catholicism is a real dark false religion, but that's another long story. Just Google Search \"Man In Black tract\" if you want the short story.)But moving back, technically-speaking... while this movie was suspenseful, at the same time I kept having to move to a different computer & keep installing the players; I was always anxious, CURIOUS to know what would happened next! That just kept building the thrills & suspense even *MORE*.A lot of people have mixed feelings about the ending to this film; to me, I was not disappointed! The style of the ending was indeed amazing, and I think more films should do it! I always now imagine how the story must have continued after the ending... And I love that - I love movies with endings that leave you guessing!And WHY on earth do those \"negative reviews\" about this film exist & where dare they coming from!?? They say this film is \"overrated\"!?...Didn't they watch the exact same film I did!??Seriously, Wow... just wow. The title \"Prisoners\" was a really creative choice - it made sense & everything paid off in the story!And I love that quote: \"Pray for the Best, Prepare for the Worst.\" ...Ditto to that!Just wrote this review because I had some free time, and because this film deserved it!Definitely one of the best films, I admit, of 2013, right alongside with Man of Steel....8/10",

This leads Detective Loki (Jake Gylenhall) on the case to look for them.This isn't just your simple person goes missing film, this is a well detailed movie, the cinematography is just beautiful and the musical score is amazing to say the least, it does a great sense of showing great emotion to a lot of the film. Although having the film at 154 minutes long you will be to hooked into the story to worry about that. The movie does a great job of showing the true emotion, the film creates a dreary state with the snow and heavy rain to leave a haunting approach. Onto the acting in my opinion I was disappointed that both Jackman and Gylenhall didn't get nominated for Oscars as they were fantastic in there roles, all the acting is outstanding as well so you'll see some great performance from side characters such as (Paul Dano, Melissa Leo and Terrence Howard).Overall Prisoners is a thrilling ride from start to finish with twists and turns and brilliant story telling to keep you entertained for the entirety of 154 minutes, you will be on the edge of your seat as well.

You shouldn't want to miss it.Also Paul Dano is at his best and I think Denis Villeneuve is one of the best taking out the best from his crew.

            "review_title": "Very strong in some areas, weak in others",
            "content": "The strongest aspect of the film was the acting. Hugh Jackman knocked it out of the park. It was a shame the other actors weren't given bigger roles, fine as they are. It was atmospheric with a decent, subtle score as well. The atmosphere kept building so you felt like it was going to amount to something major, which it did and didn't. There's something inherently dissatisfying at the heart of it. The detectives better accomplishments were completely by chance, when he was depicted to be a smart man. There were very simple things they could have done to have made him have to incorporate skill into using his chance realizations. For instance, if he hand't found the picture with the necklace on Holly's late husband, he could have just walked into the next room and discovered the truth, albeit too late. A simple reworking of this scene would have made it more satisfying, as the entire revelation about the dead husband/dead guy in priests basement, was semi-obvious to begin with. Keller also failed when it counted most, and this is majorly disappointing after he went through such lengths to find his daughter. He also could have handled it much differently when he heard \"he was there...we had tape on our mouths.\" If he fled because he thought he would become a suspect, this could have been better emphasized. Once captured, the whistle aspect could have again been used when Loki enters the house, sees the picture, and realizes Holly's identity. Basically the entire last twenty minutes could have been reworked, I think, and the film would have been an 8 instead of a 6. I think its possible the movie had a very pro-christain initiative. We are meant to feel like Keller, not becoming a \"devil\" has Holly called him, and praying, lead to the finding of his daughter, and not losing his faith. The initiative to show this I think really diluted what could have been a very powerful noir film. I suggest Gone Baby Gone over this movie, if you want something similar but more satisfying in several ways. It has twists, moral studies, and great acting all the same, though Hugh Jackman really did nail it in this.",

Excellent interpretation of Hugh Jackman who exudes the pain of a father who sees his daughter disappear from a moment. Leaves something to be desired the character starring Jake Gyllenhaal (Detective Loki), which seems to keep a detached attitude and shallow for the whole course ot the interlacing and then, inexplicably, spurting determination and investigative spirit to the very last frames. The plot is Very nice overall, just some nonsense leaves the viewer some faded unresolved question mark at the end of the film.",

However the last thirty minutes were pretty poor in my book. Not enough to make this movie bad or anything, but still poor.The story was very good until the last thirty minutes (as mentioned before). The way the story unravelled around the disappearance of these two girls was great. I was sat there at times throughout mainly the first half thinking to myself if this person was really guilty and whether they will be found and if so alive? The story was good from the start but faltered at the last hurdle. The ending and the minutes before where pretty crappy in my opinion. Enough said or spoilers will start to fly.The cast were great at times and other times were simply ok. Hugh Jackman & Jake Gyllenhaal were the stand out's in this movie. Hugh played the father really well at times i found myself liking the character as he had purpose for all his actions even if we disagree with some or think poorly of the choice. There was a scene or two i though his acting was simply ok however for the most part he was excellent and i was so very impressed. Jake played the detective very well. Not the greatest acting i have ever seen from an individual but still very good none the less. Even though i like Jake as an actor and have watched many a film with him in, i fully believed he was a detective in the scenes he featured. I though he was very believable and impressive at times. Nothing extraordinary, but enough to sell it all to me. Everyone in the cast were fine and i didn't really have a character i hated at all. But Jake & Hugh really stood out to me. Terrence Howard was my third favourite and the rest were all equal in performance. Good cast of characters if i do say so myself.The movie didn't have much (if any) action or CGI but it didn't need it at all. This movie benefited at times form more sombre moments, i do however wish there were more sombre moments.Story - 5.5/10Cast - 7/10Jake - 8/10Hugh - 8/10Overall, this movie was good but as i previously mentioned i believe the ending ruined it. It didn't make it terrible but made it a rating or two less that it would be otherwise.I do recommend a watch but not greatly. A fine film with some fine acting, 6/10.",

Instances such as when Dover kneels down in prayer prior to torturing Alex Jones or when the sex-offender Father confesses to killing a man in vengeance for having allegedly killed 16 children left a rather dark impression.Though one could argue that the storyline itself suffers a few dents, they do not take much away from the end product, which is a brilliantly-acted and thought-provoking gem of a film.",

We have a woman, his wife, who, as soon as problems arise, has to stuff herself with pills and curl up in bed, waiting for her husband to comply and resolve the situation.But before getting shocked... this couple has some friends where the wife seems to have a strong personality, compared to the more timid husband, so we balance a bit.And we have a restrained and prudent policeman, but who at times also loses his temper.What is clear is that everyone, taken to an extreme situation, will not forgive those who trespass them, and will be led into temptation.The father kidnaps the suspect of kidnapping the girls; the couple of friends, after an initial rejection, end up collaborating in the boy's torture; as for the mother, she doesn't find out much throughout the film, but it is clear to her that the first thing for the father is to protect her and her family, fulfilling that no matter what... he's a good man. Even the policeman ends up leading another suspect to suicide in a behavior that, not because it is thoughtless and momentary, is much better than that of the father.As always, the underlying idea is that legality is slow, and Dirty Harry's method has its results... as long as you don't make the mistake of culprit. In the end naturally this approach is officially rejected, and is presented to us as a dangerous temptation. But deep down, it is also presented to us as clear evidence, especially given the insufficiency and relative clumsiness of the police methods used (At the end of the film, only a couple digging in the garden... it will take them weeks, they say, with the frosts. Does anyone consider putting several pairs of diggers?)There is a parallel investigation that of course ends up having a lot to do with the main plot, with that few surprises, but the denouement is full of suspense without the need to extend it to infinity.The actors are great, especially Jackman and Gyllenhaal (the women, alas, have very minor roles).Villeneuve directs in a functional way, focusing on the story, without big scenes but maintaining a fluid pace. The aesthetic is very characteristic of the director, with special attention to the color compositions. Very good cinematography.It's nothing exceptional, but it is a quality thriller, absolutely recommended to spend an entertaining afternoon while passing through, reflecting on topics no less trite than necessary to be reminded from time to time.",

It doesn't feel forced or cheesy. You live through the situation as if it happened to you. Then through the phenomenal acting coming from both families and through Villeneuve's great directing, you build this incredible understanding for what they're going through. High Jackman gives an outstanding performance here as Keller Dover (father to one of the missing children). You understand the sense of failure that he feels as a father and although you don't agree with all of the acts that he does, you get it. This film then takes what you think you know and totally flips it on its head and comes at you with a twist that feels like a mix of outlandish, yet very realistic and you believe the whole thing through and through.This is the definition of a film that takes a concept that's been portrayed multiple times on the big screen and adds a great amount of originalism. A suspense film that I didn't feel I could predict what was going to happen next. It felt like I was a cop that had a favorite suspect, but couldn't tell you I was 100% sure.

I know Hugh Jackman felt bad for the hurt he's doing to the man but I can't really blame him. Was there a reason that he was being so conservative on the information he gave about the missing girls?

Some of the loop holes gets filled up when you retrospectively look at the film, yet... there are some glaring ones.... BUT... probably they were necessary to make this such a good film. Everyone cant be Alfred Hitchcock, but Denis Villeneuve is pretty darn good. You have seen the trailers, 2 kids get abducted and Hugh Jackman suspects a mentally challenged guy to be behind it. You just cannot avoid suspicion that every major character can be a suspect, the director instigates the viewer to think for every character that s/he may be the prime suspect, but you wont be able to guess and you play into the suspense. Even the small sub stories/ plots add to the final story. The story is not the main highlight, its the acting and the screenplay/ script Everyone plays their role to perfection. Hugh Jackman & Jack Gyllenhal probably plays their best role till date. Its a 2 and half hour movie, you just wish it was a little more longer. A really nice taut thriller.",

I think Jackman somewhat underplayed his role, while Gyllenhall played the part perfectly. It left you with some questions at the end, and some parts were nostalgic clich\u00e9 moments that just felt out of place. Outside of these minor problems, the story is insanely suspenseful and has you glued to your seat, so this is a great movie.",

            "content": "Prisoners has an amazing cast of talented actors, staring Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Viola Davis, Terrence Howard and Melissa Leo. In the film, two families come together for thanksgiving dinner and realise that they can't find their daughters anywhere. After this, the characters spend the rest of the movie trying to solve what's going on, who's to blame and where they are and ultimately what they can do about it.Prisoners is a very dark and emotional film with stellar acting, beautiful cinematography and imaculate editing. From the beging of the movie the editing stands out, building tension with long shots and infrequent cuts. The cinematography by Roger Deakins is beautiful and every shot seems extremely intentional. The sound design is also immaculate. The movie opens with a quiet atmosphere which builds as the pace of the film grows, helping to illustrate the characters emotional perspective. The film strays from the norms of loud and fast cut action sequences understanding that the best way to keep an audience's attention is subtlety.The phenominal script and acting leaves you hanging on every word as if you are watching real people in a real situation. It is consitently riveting throughout. It is one of Hugh Jackman's best performances, acting as a very stern and complex individual showing the pain of his character and how his emotional state develops with the movie. Terrence Howard also perfectly portrays a level of vulnerability that contributes to the believability of the story and carried the film in certain scenes. Paul Dana was also a perfect casting choice for the troubled individual and, while he can often overact in other films, he played this character just right. With that said, the best performance in this film was by far Jake Gyllenhaal's role as detective Loki. He plays such a convincing police officer and his performance allowed the audience to feel through him as we discover the termoil that he experiences as he tries to save these girls.The movie consitently made me excited for dialog scenes between characters as I was left so interested in what these characters had to say.Denis Villeneuve did a fantastic job with the movie, which is no suprise considering the plethora of brilliant work he has done since, such as Sicario, Arrival and Blade Runner. He perfectly brought together the fantastic components of the movie into a great product. The movie flows and builds perfectly, with each scene growing better and better.SPOILERS\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe last 10 minutes of the movie sees Hugh Jackman's character shot in the leg, and trapped in a pit underground left there by the woman who abducted his daughter. Her and her husband began abducting children as the result of the loss of their own, with the first child they abducted being the mentally challenged and now grown Alex, played by Paul Dano. The film reaches an ambiguous end after detective Loki has recovered the daughter of Keller Dover, who is still trapped underground wounded, and returns to the scene of the crime where the forensic teams are still working. Detective Loki hears a sound before the film cuts to the credits. This sound was a whistle from the trapped Dover. This is a call back to the first act, where Dover's daughter goes looking for her emergency whistle. This also calls back to the scene where Dover's daughter visits Loki in hospital and has a diolog about her whistle. It is explained that the daughter believes she found her whistle, which we can assume to be true by the end as it was seemingly waiting perfectly in the pit for Dover.The ending of the film plays into the stoutly religeous character of Dover. His anger at the loss of his daughter leads him to actions beyond acceptable and his final resting place acts as a pergatory for his sins, and makes him both an emotional and physical prisoner. The highly religious main character is made to suffer for his sins by the woman on a war against god. The whistle comes accross as a simbol of hope and salvation for Dover, a token from his daughter. She is a beacon of purity in his light that led him down a path of sin and anger, but the whistle symbolises her reaching out to him in his time of need to provide hope.With the films conclusion, we have to assume Loki is driven by his obsession with his work to find Dover and solve the case. The last lingering shot of the film sees Loki looking at the pit and hearing the whistle, so there is no doubt that his drive and determination would lead to him finding Dover.",

            "content": "\"Prisoners\" is definitely one of the best movies of 2013. It is raw, gritty and incredibly suspenseful. My heart had problems beating in a calm rhythm at several scenes. The movie opens with the Dover family walking down to the Birch's house for a thanksgiving dinner. During the dinner, the two youngest girls of both families, goes running over to Dover's house to go looking for a blue whistle toy. Time passes, and no girl is seen or heard. After a desperate search without luck, they call the police. The police is lead by detective Loki. With only an RV as a trace the investigation begins. More will i not say. The less you know, the better. \"Prisoners\" is a movie which builds and builds. The suspense never stops. By a running time of approximately 2:30 hours, it never dragged. That is mostly because of the great cast, lead by Hugh Jackman (\"X-Men\" series, \"The Prestige\"), Jake Gyllenhaal (\"Donnie Darko\", \"Jarhead\") and Paul Dano (\"Looper\", \"Little Miss Sunshine\"). Credits must also be given to director Denis Villeneuve (\"Enemy\", \"Polytechnique\") for a very strong direction. A movie like this is all about the present of the actors. Very little is told of the background of any of the characters. And you can almost feel the characters past, express itself through their every action. So by all that being said. \"Prisoners\" is a masterful achievement. It is perfection on every level. And i believe it will be remembered for a long, long time. Enjoy!",

            "content": "Prisoners, 2013.One of my pet hates is when people see or hear one bad review about a movie and automatically write it off without a second thought. It's amazing how \"Sheep-like\" we've all become in recent years. Most likely due to social media, where one person will post a status rubbishing a movie.Hugh Jackman (Keller Dover) and Jake Gyllenhaal (Detective Loki) star in this epic drama/thriller directed by Denis Villeneuve. Set in Pennsylvania, Dover runs a small carpentry business and maintains a deeply religious life. The plot begins when 2 young girls are abducted from the family's Thanksgiving dinner, one of whom is Dover's girl. Gyllenhaal plays the hard-working local detective with the \"never say die\" attitude, full of late nights, no sleep, plenty of coffee and provides the \"won't stop until the case is solved\" feel, etc.I feel sorry for Hugh Jackman sometimes, mainly due to the fact that he cops criticism of his more theatre driven roles. If there was going to be a break-away film that separated Hugh from \"that guy with the beard in X-Men\" and \"The boy from OZ\", this was it. It's evident in the way that he acts in this new thriller that he had something to prove to the world as an actor. You could tell he was making up for not receiving roles like this in the past. Every actor will always say: \"I don't care what people think\", but we all know deep down that we all care to some degree. It's who we are. Like most thrillers, the story-line was very slow, drowning (although in a good way) and puzzling. Constantly making you think about different scenarios and suspects. Decent movie-goers would probably work this plot out in due time. The suspense grows throughout the film, accentuated with low light levels which bring on that sense of anticipation and depth. The overall dull/gloomy appearance of the film is a credit to its own storyline. Reminding us as viewers the dimness of the whole situation and how hard it would be to be in Dover's situation. Jackman gives a portrayal of what I think any parent would do to ensure their child returns home safely. The passion, anger and overall stress steams out of Dover in many scenes where his temper is taken to new levels of hate.I thought Paul Dano (Alex Jones) played an enormous role in the success of this film. His quirky features fit his role perfectly and at times he scared the crap out of me without any dialect at all. Given the intellectual capability of a 10 year old, Alex feels the full wrath of Dover's agony, and at times, madness. Gyllenhaal also makes his mark in a role which has been played out a thousand times previously. He turns a simple script into a meaningful progression of the calm and collective. He acts as Dover's rock and plays the detective part with ease, winning him the Best Supporting Actor award at the 2013 Hollywood Film Awards.The main reason I watched this film was due to my eagerness to view Jackman's transformation from his previous typical roles. He did not fail expectations and proved his worth. You are left contemplating and thinking until the final moment of the film and even after the credits have started rolling up the screen. Prisoners is a suspense- riddled thriller from start to finish and a must see for 2013.",

It is much easier for me to point out what I didn't like, than what I did. \u0095 I think Hugh Jackman did a good job, but his character (Keller Dover) was a little over the top. I'm not sure how that happened, but I suspect the director, Denis Villeneuve, might have been responsible. Subtract five points. \u0095 Unfortunately the film followed the same slothful path as do so many lesser movies\u2014 blame conservative Christianity. Subtract five points for laziness and cowardice. \u0095 We are led to believe that the character Franklin Birch (played by Terrence Howard) would not be held accountable for the kidnapping and repeated beatings (which led to his death) of character Alex Jones (played by Paul Dano). The charge is felony murder, and he would be prosecuted. Subtract three points. \u0095 My popcorn had too much butter. Subtract one point. Everything else about the move was great. I left the theater with a good feeling. I would recommend that \"Prisoners\" and Sean Penn's \"The Pledge\" (Jack Nicolson, Benicio Del Toro, Patricia Clarkson and Beau Daniels) be bundled.

            "content": "For the movie Prisoners, this quote encapsulates this movie perfectly. A quote repeated thrice during the movie yet left an imprint in your brain.The movie keeps a steady pace throughout. A movie that quickly shifts in the first 10 minutes and from that point forward keeps your eyes wide, or keeps them hidden behind your fingers by the anxiety inducing tencity presented. All up until the edging last 30 minutes that keep you at the edge of your seat.But without the amazing cast this movie could have very much turned into a flop. The emotions presented in the characters seek their way out of the screen and attach to you. Hugh Jackmans depiction of a religious father, that has an obsession of keeping his family safe, stuck in the char that is, his family is not safe. Jake Gyllenhalls depiction of an emotional husk is what in my opinion drives this movie home safely. In fact, all the actors, no matter how much or how little they are on screen aces their characters and serves reality to fiction.The movie can be interpreted in a plethora of ways. But the very common thread in the story told here is prisoners. All of our characters are very much prisoners in their own way. The mothers are imprisoned by their helplessness, to the point of imprisoning themselves in their own homes. The children and Alex are literal prisoners. Loki, a prisoner of his own mind, where he cannot seem to find an escape from the case and his duty. Keller, the greatest prisoner of them all. When Keller first confronts Alex at the parking lot he shouts \"He's a free man and so am I!\". He sure as hell is not. He's built himself a prison in the form of guilt and in his mind, duty. The duty to protect his daughter.The fact is that this movie tugs at you. It drills a hole of uncertainty, you feel for every character. You feel remorse one second due to the performance of one actor and the next second you are angered and certain due to the performance of another. Thus you are always unsure of what the outcome may be. \"Hope for the best, prepare for the worst\".",

It's intense, and pressurising to watch how a father can go from loving to relentlessly lethal. Hugh Jackman goes far beyond the call of duty and far away from Wolverine as much as he possibly can, and he does it justice. Keller Dover is a man going through every parent's worse nightmare, and he overall succeeds in just that.On the other hand, Jake Gyllenhaal plays Detective Loki, once again, a great actor playing a great role. Dover and Loki are two completely different characters played by two great actors; Mysterio and Wolverine are both stunning altogether. Loki and Dover are both under pressure, and how Denis Villeneuve creates this immense thriller, is glorious. Other actors including; Melissa Leo, Terrence Howard, Viola Davis, Paul Dano and Maria Bello are all top-notch. If you love a good thriller, then Prisoners is a must-watch on Netflix UK.The chase is on, and Jackman is not letting this chase go! Will Gyllenhaal agree or disagree with Jackman's actions? Or will Jackman lose the person he loves for good?10/10.",

But truly, after 10 minutes I was completely sucked into this story. So much in fact, that when the credits rolled I felt like a lost child. I found his performance (everyone's) to be so incredibly human. No one did as we would normally expect them to do. Like a sudden change of heart, or in their morals.

The script for this movie is doing several things that I consider insulting for the viewers. First, it gives you all the information in advance on a silver platter, there are no real surprises in the movie (though you keep hoping there will be some), but the clues are so visible and obvious that anyone who ever had to solve a logical question, should be able to understand the plot pretty much from the beginning... It also tries to shock the viewer in order to convey the characters' dilemmas. It's an easy and cheap way of conveying a message. I find it more effective and lasting when the ideas are presented to me to digest than being thrown at my face, trying to force me consider issues that I don't even think are worth my consideration. The movie is full packed with gaping holes in the plot. Things that just don't make much sense in 2013, and Jake's character, as a detective, seems to simply be a very bad, incapable detective. Overall, it's disappointing to see so many good actors, and good acting, goes to waste on a badly written, badly thought of, screenplay.",

            "content": "Prisoners has story and performance that are great just by themselves, though, together they are what makes the film a true gem of cinema. The premise is legitimately terrifying in its presentation. The weight, severity, and tension of the film feel so real that, at times, it does what every film should do; make its fiction appear as reality to you.Though Jake Gyllenhaal is very good in this, I do feel that Hugh Jackman steals most, if not all, the attention with his performance. He's a really good in most of his other work, poor in some (more than likely bad story/bad direction), but it is in Prisoners he shows how much can come from his acting. I would equate it to the passion seen in his role as Jean Val Jean in Les Miserables. Perhaps that's what it is. He can be good with subtlety, however, it is in the passion of emotion that he does best. As Keller Dover he is nothing but passionate, yet, he is very real. He bursts out in anger in one scene, is told to calm, does so, and even apologizes for his outburst yet still persists with a degree of intensity that is clearly from being upset rather than just raw anger. There are many more scenes like this that succeed so well at removing you from just watching a movie and takes you on intimate experience of story telling that feels undeniably and hauntingly real. This is probably one of his best performances if not the principal one.Few could get away with doing a film like this and call it good. Fewer doing so in exemplary fashion. This is one of the fewer. It's honestly very good actors with a very good director showing you human character in a narrative that is by no means an easy one to tell.",

            "content": "A strangely disturbing, plot twisting, chilling film with a religious/moral subtext, PRISONERS from director Denis Villeneuve, deals with the kidnapping of two young friends whose families are celebrating Thanksgiving together. How the authorities and their parents respond to this horrific event is at the core of this film exploring the biblical phrase \"an eye for an eye\", the nature of sin, and its roots in life's tragic adversities. What lengths can one go in the pursuit of justice without the malignancy of hate corrupting our very being?Passages from the bible are invoked in the first scene where we come upon a vulnerable deer silently moving through the wet, beautifully lit trees - and then the camera focuses on the barrel of a rifle and BANG \u2013 this innocent creature falls to its knees. The tone and mood of PRISONERS is thus established and reiterated by a voice-over verse from the bible. Father and son are the hunters and Hugh Jackman as Keller Dover the tightly wound \"survivalist\" parent, gives an intense if not frenetic performance of a man who will stop at nothing to keep his family safe even if it means seeking vigilante justice. His wife Grace (Maria Bello,) seems to need sheltering, as she conveys a somnambulistic helplessness in the face of this tragedy.In contrast the other couple, whose child is also missing, despair and grieve deeply, but keep their moral center intact - or at least attempt to. Terrence Howard as Franklin Birch is an actor whose portrayal of an anguished father is more emotive in his understated, quiet, velvety manner than his histrionic bullying male counterpart. Viola Davis as his wife, Nancy Birch, is the voice of quiet reason, but she too is compromised by the need to seek retribution for the disappearance of her adored daughter. The unknowable can be a force for ethical transgression when one is confronted by drastic circumstances.Jake Gyllenhaal's Detective Loki, is the embodiment of the legal system - a twitching (is this part of his character or the actor's own affliction?) officer of the law with a 100% clearance rate on his arrest record; so we the spectators put our faith in him to unravel the many clues and suspects that arise, creating a deep climate of suspense. Gyllenhaal's characterization, though adequate, was not \"inspired\" which could be due to the many plot zigzags as well as contortions of basic legal procedures that were distracting, and took me out of the small- town Pennsylvania environment back into my own dubious head.Paul Dano plays the prime culprit, Alex Jones \u2013 a young man with disabilities who is both sympathetic and repellent and living with his \"aunt\" the wonderful actress Melissa Leo. He is mentally \"a child\" and one that becomes the symbol of an infantile captive who is the victim of perverted rage and vengeance. Yet we are left hanging as new stratagems keep turning up leaving the audience exhausted.PRISONERS not only refers to those who are physically held hostage, jailed, or restricted against their will, but those who are moving about freely yet are psychologically subjugated by fanatical demons that erupt when the stress of an event collides with their inherent emotional being. Despite the beauty of the cinematography that delicately defined the melancholy spirit of this brokenhearted world, the movie could not overcome the tendency to engorge itself in melodramatic horror, and that is its fatal flaw.",

But it is not here with the performances that was the problem.The issue I had with this movie was not Jake Gylenhall, but the illogical way he operated as a detective. I do not fault him, as he too turned in a solid performance. But the constant searches of homes with no search warrant obtained, calling for no backup, transporting victims in his own cruiser without first notifying EMS or, again, backup, was unbelievable.Nothing detracts from a movie more than it's failure to detail, and this movie displayed that in abundance. It seems every movie I have seen with Gylenhall playing a cop disregards common sense and a believable approach to police procedure.Most people who have watched any movie or even the news is aware police cannot just force entry into one's home without probable cause and/or a search warrant, and anyone with a shred of knowledge about the legal system knows that evidence found in such an even would not be admissible as evidence.I get that I am supposed to suspend my disbelief, but the actions his character takes are insulting to a fellow responder, the worst being transporting a victim in his own car while driving recklessly and endangering the lives of others.Had the director just made half an effort to adhere to some kind of realistic policing procedure, it would have gotten a higher rating, but I will not go more than a 6, and that is based solely on the performances of the actors.",

He plays every scene for the cheap seats - you can almost see him reaching deeply to bring every ounce of angst or anger up. He serves a lot of aces but I just don't see enough subtlety for him to sustain a thrilling rally.\nAs the dad straining at his limits of humanity in his quest to find his daughter, Jackman is a working class Neeson-in-Taken facsimile striking one note for several hours.\nThe supporting cast is incredible on paper, but no-one other than Gyllenhaal and Melissa Leo gets anything to work with. Paul Dano and Terrence Howard in particular are wasted terribly.\nThe plot feels like a Scandi Noir relocated to the mid west. It's also twists and turns, bizarre coincidence, red herrings, and tricky symbolism. I feel like they could have junked a fair amount and tightened into either a cracking thriller, or amped up the psychological tension of Jackman's character descending into darkness.\nAlternatively, a limited series format could have allowed some of the sub plots and spirals to develop a bit more (although then it would have basically been The Killing).\nFor my money, too much of everything added up to not much of anything, which is a shame because it's clear everyone showed up with conviction.",

            "content": "My nails were stubs at the end of this film. Sitting in my seat as the credits rolled and the adrenaline coursed through my veins I took a minute to marvel at the sheer power of escapism when executed properly. Not since David Fincher's 'Seven' has a director been able to elevate tension from the get go and hold it so consistently for the duration of the film. As other reviewers have mentioned, the film is not without a few inconsistencies and coincidences in plot. However, the spellbinding effect Villeneuve masterfully weaves over the audience manages to push that all aside until the post-film reflection commences. Character-wise Hugh Jackman puts in a gripping performance as Keller Dover; an ostensibly freelance carpenter whose daughter is one of the initial kidnapping victims. A hot-headed character from the get-go, we experience his anguish, moral degradation and desperation as he searches for his daughter. I thought that Jake Gyllenhal's performance was spot-on in the role of a clever small town detective trying to live up to his flawless record. His actions were plausible and never seemed overdone. The high point of the film for me was Paul Dano, who continues to showcase his versatile acting talents in the role of a deeply disturbed and mentally handicapped young man suspected of the central kidnappings on which the film is based. This is the sole Denis Villeneuve film I've watched to date but it has certainly piqued my interest in his other works. In addition to the standard thriller camera angles, we were treated to some rather exceptional camera work that played a large part in maintaining the suspenseful atmosphere of the film. Shots such as Paul Dano's single illuminated eye showed insight into the workings of the human imagination and how fear is evoked. Unfortunately not every aspect of the film is perfect. As I walked out of the theater and my pulse returned to normal I began noticing certain inconsistencies and implausibilities that appear throughout the film which may or may not (depending on the viewer) detract from the overall experience. As this ground has been covered in numerous other reviews I won't delve into details but the bottom line is that the degree in which these flaws affect your movie experience will vary somewhat depending on your mindset and approach to the film.All in all Prisoners certainly provided an exhilarating experience at the cinema that completely warrants the price of admission. Despite some minor plot mishaps and loose ends we are presented with a thoroughly enjoyable kidnapping thriller that, as the girl in the row behind me exclaimed upon exiting the theater, may take a few years off your life if you aren't careful. 8/10",

            "review_title": "Fantastic, Refreshing Film of the 2013 Fall Season (May Contain Spoilers)",
            "content": "As expected, September gives its film lovers the chance to cleanse themselves of the uninspired and redundant movie season that is Summer. This month is the first of many that will give many cinemas across the globe freedom from reboots, remakes, rehashes, and the now-accepted void that is New Hollywood.Thus, the first cleanse offered, in my opinion, is the newly-released film, \"Prisoners\", starring Best Actor Oscar nominee Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal. Focusing on a parent's worst nightmare, child abduction and possible murder, the film incessantly grabs you from the first frame to the last. Walking out of this film without any feelings of gut-wrenching or punching is impossible; unless, you are a complete sociopath intending to laugh at every scene.Jackman, plays Keller Dover, a loving husband, father, and carpenter in trade, who, along with his wife, Grace (played by Maria Bello in an understandably catatonic state throughout the movie), and friends/neighbors, Franklin and Nancy Birch (played gracefully by Terrance Howard and Best Actress Oscar nominee Viola Davis), find their worlds turned upside down by the kidnappings of their youngest children after Thanksgiving dinner.Seeking the help of Gyllenhaal's Detective Loki (No \"Thor\" jokes, please!), an officer seemingly dealing with demons of his own, the only information they have is the appearance and disappearance of a mysterious RV parked not far from the Birch home. A creepy man-child (played astonishingly by Paul Dano) is the prime suspect, questioned, held, and, of course, released after the required 48-hours. Without giving away spoilers, Jackman decides to place justice into his own hands.While I understand his position as a desperate father, I cannot condone the behavior because of the fine line of criminality that Dover exhibits between protector of his child and sadist. \"Prisoners\" director, Denis Villeneuve, sharply presents that case because, as a viewer, you want the children found, but at the same time, you feel that you're participating in a crime, while questioning whether or not the ends justify the means. More so, the Birches struggle to find which side of the coin they belong as well, and they often are the voices of reason. What follows Jackman's actions is a film of welcomed twists and turns that, as clich\u00c3\u00a9 and trite as it sounds nowadays, truly leave you by the edge of your seat.Therefore, I recommend this film (8 out of 10 Kashmirs). The performances are top-notch. Jackson never fails to deliver as he goes back and forth with both grief and depravity as he serves as the audience surrogate. While Gyllenhaal raises the bar as he plays the reluctant hero, both wary of the individuals involved and job weary, period. Plus, I did appreciate the nod to Gyllenhaal's early work in the much underrated \"Zodiac\". I will leave that nod unspoiled for those desiring to figure it out themselves. Last, but not least, I must give special applause to Paul Dano, who delivers the role as a constant enigma. Viewers never know if he's a great deceiver or a victim himself.While I cannot find fault with the film, the film's ending is a cool smack to the face. While mildly annoyed, it was a taste of the unexpected and rarely used sublime. \"Prisoners\" is a must-see film of the Fall season.",

            "review_title": "A near perfect thriller",
            "content": "With a star studded cast including Hugh Jackman (X-Men, Les Miserables) and Jake Gyllenhaal (Donnie Darko, Brokeback Mountain), Prisoners always looked to have the potential to hit the right spot with audiences, and it didn't disappoint. When two young girls go missing in a quiet suburb, is it up to Detective Loki (Gyllenhaal) to track them down. But when the prime suspect Alex Jones (Paul Dano) is revealed to have the IQ of a 10 year old and no evidence against him, the case starts to run cold, and Loki turning more desperate as the hours tick away. With no new leads, father of one of the girls, Keller Dover (Jackman) takes it upon himself to find the girls by any means possible, and will let nothing stop him on his mission.One must first credit the acting and I would not be surprised if one or more of the cast showed up in next year's Oscar nominations. Here Jackman gives the performance of a lifetime, which is nice to see after his involvement in the horrendous, Movie 43. You really feel for his character as his anger and love for his daughter drives him to unspeakable acts. But Jackman portrays this incredibly and I'm not sure another actor could have done as good a job. His performance was truly moving and you felt both saddened by his situation and even start to sympathise with him, despite some of the atrocities he carries out. But this is only due to the quality of his acting that you connect with the character so well. Gyllenhaal was also outstanding, with some masterful acting and I would argue maybe even his career defining performance. You can really feel the characters anguish at his inability to find the girls and in the end it's more a personal vendetta against the kidnapper than the detective doing his job. Prisoners also had a tremendous supporting cast with brilliant performances given by Melissa Leo (The Fighter), Paul Dano (Looper) and Terrence Howard (Iron Man).The plot is dark and gritty and some viewers may find it a little disturbing. I certainly did which was a surprise, but this is essential for the viewers to understand the characters pain. With themes of mystery, kidnap, torture and questioning the faith of God, this thriller may not entice some of the more light hearted types. But director Denis Villeneuve weaves the viewers through a well crafted story, that whilst obvious in some places, kept the viewer excited to the very end. However it must be said that certain aspects of the plot were never fully explained, leaving for a slightly aggravating ending. Some people may watch the film and wonder \"would I do such terrible things for someone in my family?\" This is a little scary considering the plot, but part of the genius of the film, making you feel really involved and invested in the story throughout. The film had a fantastic score which is essential for any good dramatic piece. Many filmmakers are tempted by the ease of overusing music as mood filler, but Prisoners had just the right mix; not overusing it but rather applying it carefully where needed. The cinematography was perhaps some of the best I have ever seen, with interesting camera work, shadowy grey-scales, and wonderful use of lighting; hardcore film buffs will certainly enjoy.Ultimately Prisoners is a near perfect thriller, taking audiences on a roller-coaster of emotions. It leaves viewers with perhaps one question to consider, that we should all think about more often when heinous crimes of this nature appear in the news: who are the real Prisoners? The young girls kidnapped or the families left behind waiting for them to come home?",

I can easily argue that such was the best decision, for if not for him, we would not have been given this wonderful masterpiece. 'Prisoners' may just be the best movie I've seen all year. After leaving the theater, I was still left with awe in regard to the incredibly dark (and awesome) atmosphere. Hugh Jackman gives his best acting performance to date, and pretty much every actor casted was sensational.You can truly feel the various emotions and mental afflictions each character faces, as it builds up to the resolution of the mystery, piece by piece. The story seems simple at first, yet the execution is just so breathtaking and well-written, you are forced to stay at the edge of your seat. You may feel like it's slow-paced at first, but as you progress, you are gradually more and more indulged by the insightful atmosphere. However, in my opinion, the strongest element (and possibly the most Oscar-worthy) of this film is the cinematography. All of the rack focuses, slow panning wideshots, close-ups, etc., along with the dark color gradients and perfect lighting, totally sold the visual tone and storytelling aspect. I really do hope Roger Deakins does win an Oscar this time. His work in this movie was incredible!I don't really have any complaints. If you're looking for a dark thriller with powerful performances and prestigious photography, this is the movie for you this year! Do not miss out! 9/10",

Why did she say that (you were there)? And how did he knew immediately that the auntie was the criminal? And, once he knew, why didn't he immediately put a gun to her head? Why the hell bring up the apology and door fixing excuse and putting a pistol and a rope in a zipped bag rather than at least in your back? Just why?And even in the situation of having your child abducted, you wouldn't torture a retard like that for so many days when he just won't talk, and why block him out of sight? An day or two would make any man give up, and when he said they are in the maze, any real person would break open the door and get him out, but Hugh kept talking through the pipe, never even telling the detective about it, so frustrating.And I don't want to start with the detective (Jake Gyllenhal), why the hell didn't he searched the aunties house the first time her nephew was a suspect? Why? And what was with the abandoned Pontiac? Sure as hell a suspects house would go through a thorough search, check (Richard Jewell) movie to know how they deal with a suspect, the auntie had a gun, syringes, strange sedative drinks, sure some cop would stumble on if they searched.Anyways, great acting, very thrilling, till half the movie, but total failure half way on, the ending just frustrates beyond imagination and makes you hate the entire movie, cast and story.",

But this one confirms my love for Denis Villeneuve and shows that he doesn't just shine in big fantastical pieces, but can also manage to keep it really small. The score by Johannsson is also great, if a bit more understated than what I'm used to from him.It's not a masterpiece though - the finale is not bad, but I found it a bit too easy and forgiving, given how grim and confrontational the movie was leading up to it. I would have preferred for the movie to be even longer, or for a little bit more thought and attention to have gone to the various stages of resolution.But it's no disappointment overall and in fact I would strongly recommend it, if you like material like True Detective, or even Se7en, though Prisoners is far more muted and believably dark.",

Overall, the film was highly predictable, and totally oversold by the trailer. It was 2 1/2 hours long, and despite moments of anticipation, was predominately slow moving and boring. The plot was loose at best, and filled with gaps, leaving you wondering about why some of the characters were even in the film. And then there is the ending. Well. Talk about leaving it hanging.

I couldn't stop thinking about it for hours and I wanted to tell everyone about this masterpiece of a movie. It really taps into the emotions. I can't wait for it to come out on DVD, so I can buy it and watch it over and over again.

Just wish the story had more to offer as the climax was presented very late and it also serves as the resolution of film, so the payoff did not feel worth it. A whole lot of suspense and buildup to ultimately have a short and unsatisfying conclusion. But that is just my personal preference and hence I didn't even want to rate the movie because my ratings tend to be more based on how much I enjoyed the film as compared to the objective quality of it. It is outstanding content but would I watch again knowing how the story plays out? Probably not.",

            "content": "Being a little familiar with the work of director Denis Villeneuve, I had high expectations for this film. And with Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal starring, I was more then curious what they could pull off in a dramatic movie. Turned out my expectations where surpassed!Prisoners start with Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) and his family celebrating Thanksgiving with their friends, the Birch family. All is well with both families but when Keller's daughter goes outside to play with Franklin Birch's (Terrence Howard) daughter and they go missing, the lives of both families turn into a nightmare. Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) is assigned to the case of the missing girls, but progress is slow and he has trouble finding leads. Keller Dover is disappointed in Loki, getting more and more desperate each day and decides to take matters in his own hands. But how far will he go?Prisoners is an excellent movie that kept me on the edge of my seat for 2.5 hours. The movie looked stunning and the performances of the actors where through the roof. Jackman plays one of the best roles of his career, I really felt the desperation that Keller Dover was going through. But the best performance for me has to be Jake Gyllenhaal as detective Loki. I enjoyed every scene with him and was constantly rooting for him to find a new lead in the case, which gets more horrifying as the story progresses.The only complaint I have with this movie is that sometime it feels like your watching two movies at once: an emotional drama and a scary thriller. Overall it does a good job at balancing between these two extremes but there are a few moments when the 'switch' between the two genres was a little to abrupt for me. And because I like the thriller aspect of the movie the most (parts of it remind me of Silence of the Lambs), there where a few times when I wished that they kept going on the thriller aspect instead of pulling back a bit. That said this is a well made, emotionally exhausting movie that leaves you pondering about what you will do if you where put in the shoes of Keller Dover or detective Loki. So I highly recommend to watch this movie, but be prepared to be emotionally drained afterwards.",

And by mid way it fell right into the typical mystery formula. No actual suspense, since the clues are all given. And of course the villein gives an oratory on why everything has happened. UGH.It was mostly creepy.\"The Call\" (little girl kidnapping story) for example was creepy too, but you felt for Haley Berry's character right off, suffering with her. This movie lacks that central character you understand. Who's movie was it? It felt like it wanted to go to some gripping emotional areas, but sort of fizzled, at least for me.It was entertainment, but fairly average for my taste.Blessings, Max Rainet A movie lover for life.",

Too late to UN-see it, but, maybe not for YOU. Jackman, being a survivalist, should NEVER have let himself get into the predicament he did. First mistake was turning his back on Melissa Leo, second was allowing her to make him put on the hand cuffs, third was not gunning the Camaro in reverse and taking her off with the open door she was standing beside, fourth was allowing her to shoot him in the leg, fifth was getting into the hole, sixth was not finding a way to climb back out and simply push the plywood aside, seventh was not throwing something at the plywood when he heard voices above, and attract some attention. Add to that, the fact that NOBODY even checked the Camaro and decided to dig on the opposite side of the house. May have crossed Jakes mind, but if it did, fade-out eliminated the thought. Is that enough? How about - Are these girls MORONS talking to strangers and getting into the camper? BOTH girls? When one of their fathers is a SURVIVALIST?

Totally unrealistic, just ridiculous. An he can beat him to a pulp but hitting they bad guys fingers with a hammer is where he draws the line? BAHAHAHA And then there was Jackman's useless worthless whining wife. What a horrible part poorly played. And oh yeah, I kept waiting for the air bag in the dash of the police car to explode when Jackman was pounding on it. And the real bad guy is an old woman? oh and let's linger on the maze medallion the first time we see it so we can show it again later when Gyllenhal, \"great\" detective that he was, has apparently forgotten seeing it around a DEAD guys neck three hours ago.Sorry but Jake just wasn't bringing it in this, he just looked like an idiot and you cant tell me he wouldn't have been fired for telling his police captain BOSS to f off. Lots of badly telegraphed crap like that whistle too. And in the end Jackman goes to jail but they don't bother to show that or the effect on his family. Just garbage, but Jackman himself at least did a good job where as Howard was just bad. Really glad he ain't Tony Stark's guy any more.Seriously, you know why this doesn't work? Because once Jackman starts beating the kid up, he becomes a criminal too REGARDLESS of why he's beating up the kid. Once your hero does something despicable, you lose sympathy for him immediately and even more so in the end when you find out the poor schmuck he pummeled isn't the bad guy anyway.",

But I found the storyline to be absolutely very weak.Every breakthrough in the investigation is based on pure luck, and apart from that there are several elements in the story that just don't make sense. How does the copy-cat know where the children live to steal their clothes? Why does he commit suicide while he was innocent? Why does Alex, a victim himself, not say more when being tortured for several days? Why does the aunt suddenly loses her cool by not opening the door and stoppng to hide the girl?

            "content": "\"Prisoners\" is a film that floored me on my first viewing and enthralled me on my second. Like most films with a central mystery, Prisoners takes its concept and unravels it into a giant web of intrigue, trapping its viewer and engulfing them in its gloomy universe. However, upon my second viewing, I realized what a dense, symbolic and haunting film this really is. This is without a doubt the best film of 2013: no other drama released this year managed to tap into human fears and desires this well. Every performance is impeccable, namely from the two leading men, Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal. Jackman is the crushed, brokenhearted father, consumed by rage and agony in his desperate attempts to reunite his family. Early in the film, he tells his son to \"be ready. It doesn't matter if it's a hurricane, flood, anything.\" Perhaps it is either cruel irony or his character Keller Dover not heeding his own advice, but the way he is forced off the deep end as his psyche crumbles is both draining and curious to watch. Gyllenhaal's character has the most complete development in the film. A man who begins as a straight-shooting detective with a spotless record is transformed by Gyllenhaal into a man tortured by the work he held so dear, a man frozen in fear by his first real challenge in the line of duty. Every supporting performance is airtight and contributes to the film's slow-burning and unbearably tense atmosphere. Every shot lingers on for a time that floats between comfortable and uncomfortable. The cinematography by Roger Deakins and direction by Denis Villenueve are beautiful and capture some incredible shots throughout the film's massive run time. This contrast between direction and editing is one of the many contrasts in Prisoners, most of which are revealed through the film's deep-rooted symbolism. The imagery of crosses and The Lord's Prayer contrast deeply with Jackman's torture of Paul Dano's character throughout the film. The use of mazes as both a symbol and a plot device is ingenious, as the maze is seen to represent a sort of prison, in which the viewer realizes every character is trapped in after seeing the degree to which all of them have been trapped in their vices. The density and intelligence contained in this filmmaking was unmatched throughout the year of 2013. Prisoners is an incredible film and a must-watch for any lover of cinema.",

It's too slow-paced to generate real gut level excitement, too logically flawed for the intellectual appeal it strives for. Naturally, there's an emotional reaction to the chilling theme of child abduction. That along with the overall quality of the filmmaking will briefly create the impression that this is serious stuff. The rambunctious performance of Hugh Jackman as the semi-civilized father of the abducted child and fine performances across the board, notably Jack Gyllenhaal as the detective, will also earn some admiration. But the notion that this is a great movie is a fleeting illusion. This movie will be soon forgotten. Taken, the Liam Neelson thriller, wanted simply to rescue a daughter in dire distress, and does so in wildly entertaining fashion. Prisoners wants to explore the nature of morality in an extreme situation, such as when the life of one's child is on the line. Good concept. I wish it had succeeded, but it doesn't. It wants to be thought-provoking, but it's a straw-man argument of a movie. No one, all things considered, condones the conduct of the child's father\u2014not because it's violent, but because it's ineffectual. Dad is throwing a tantrum that's an obstacle to the success of the mission. That becomes apparent almost immediately. Prisoners demonstrates the futility of violence by contrivance. It's scripted to be futile. Two little girls are abducted while their families are at a Thanksgiving get-together. Hugh Jackman's character, a gun totting suburban survivalist (I've got several of them on my block\u0085 okay, don't believe me.), who has little patience with the authority's effort to solve the case. Outraged when the police release a promising suspect\u2014a young man with the \"mind of a ten year old\"\u2014he goes vigilante on the guy and imprisons him in an abandoned building. Using his fists and a scalding shower, he is relentless in his efforts to get a confession from a pathetic masochist who doesn't have much to say. Oh well, let's give it one more day. One more left hook\u0085 One more hot shower\u0085 Meanwhile, check out what's in the basement of a disgraced former priest? Is that a clue? Who cares? Solving the mystery isn't what this is all about. If standard police procedure would have found the kids (or their bodies)in the first act, then let's not get bogged down with standard police procedure. Who's got time to trail a suspect and conduct searches. Someone is trying to offer insight into the human condition here, not mere entertainment. Such lofty ambition, only to lose sight of the job at hand.What we get is bait and switch.The ending is either a moral cop-out or a clever gimmick. You get to choose the fate of the central character, based on whether you think dad is a hero or a demon.",

However, at the end of the movie I felt that I wasn't satisfied with the way that things were explained. Some clues were given that did not contribute or even contradicted some characters:!!-- Spoilers from this point on--!!1. When Alex walked the dog, he tortured it for a few seconds. I think this was done to give the audience a negative perception of Alex which would give Keller reason to torture him. I think this does not really beat with the plot in which Alex appeared to be innocent and if you interpret the sentence: \"They only cried when I left them\", you might even conclude that Alex was of a comfort to the kidnapped girls. (Might be a wrong interpretation on my side). 2. I think it is not properly explained why Alex couldn't tell who the real bad guy was. 3. Joy says that Keller used duct tape on her mouth, but it wasn't explained why she thought that and it made me believe that Keller was schizophrenic and involved in the crime. These (and a couple more) events might have made the story more confusing than it needed to be. More details on the things that happened to Alex/the kidnapped girls could have cleared this confusion (or I am missing things). Also I think that there was quite a lot of coincidence and too little detective work involved in solving the mystery.In the end I think it still is a good movie depicting the moral dilemma of Keller very intensely.Not taking this in account in my review, but I found the movie so intense, dark and disturbing that I wished it to end and I wasn't entertained that much.",

            "content": "As the credits began to roll I was ready to give this movie a 9 or 10 out of 10. But after having a short time to critically analyze what I just watched, I realized it has a huge plot hole that kind of ruins it for me.Plot hole: Alex Jones is said to have a driver's license which is completely implausible. Even if the state of Pennsylvania would grant someone with the IQ of a 10 year old a license, there's no way he could have been issued one with the name Alex Jones considering the real Alex Jones died long ago. I don't understand why the aunt would let her kidnap victim drive around in the first place, even if he is \"brain-washed\". But apparently she also must've took him into the DMV, presumably showed them the birth certificate and/or social security card of the real Alex Jones (her deceased son) and the state then proceeds to issue a driver's license to a person who has been deceased for years.Even if the aunt had managed to pass him off as Alex Jones to the state/DMV, when Alex was brought in for questioning early in the movie, police would have identified him as being the aunt's child (since that's who the real Alex Jones was) which would raise extreme suspicion when both Alex and the aunt said the nature of their relationship was nephew/aunt, not son/mother.It may seem like a minor detail, but without the license extreme suspicion would have been brought upon Alex and the aunt at the very beginning of the investigation and the movie/investigation would've been over MUCH quicker.Very disappointed that seemingly almost no one else notices this massive plot hole, even 99% of the people that pointed out several other (more minor) plot holes.Even though the movie has a massive plot hole, I still give it a 6 as the other aspects of the movie were so well done that I'd rather watch this than 50% of other movies, a lot of which are just terrible. At least this movie kept me wildly entertained and engaged, which I can't say about a whole lot of other movies.",

            "content": "I will never forget the first time I watched this incredible movie.\nIt was a couple of years ago and I was 14-15 years old. I was hanging out with my cousin in my living-room, it was late at night (02:00 AM) and I felt ready to go to bed. My cousin had other plans and somehow managed to talk me into putting on this weird movie I\u00b4d never heard of, \"Prisoners\". I was not a fan of Jake Gyllenhaal and I only recognized Hugh Jackman from the X-Men movies and I didn\u00b4t really think of him as a good or even capable actor. I thought he got his parts in movies because of his impressive physique and great looks. I had never heard of the director (Dennis Villeneuve) and really doubted he had ever made anything worth watching (keep in mind that I was very young, dumb, pissed off and tired at this point). To say that I was skeptical of this movie would be an understatement.As I said earlier I was extremely tired and upset at this point. But 15-20 minutes into the movie I was a completely different person. I was wide awake, sitting on the edge of my seat and had no bitterness left in my body. I had forgotten about my doubts and skepticism about the movie, the actors and the director as I was busy staring at the screen trying to follow the development of the story and figure out what was going to happen next.If my interest and focus hadn\u00b4t already been captured by the clever writing and great story-development the acting sure did. The performances by Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal were fantastic and captivating. However, I was far more impressed by Paul Dano\u00b4s performance as it came out of the blue for me, I had never heard of him before watching this. The feelings of fear and pain that Dano was able to give off was incredible. After watching this movie I made an effort to watch more movies starring Dano, and to this day I haven\u00b4t been able to find a single movie where he gives a poor or mediocre performance, he always delivers great performances.When the movie was over and the time was somewhere around 04:40 AM I felt as if Vincent Vega had stabbed me in the heart with i syringe full of adrenaline. I was not about to go to bed that\u00b4s for sure. I apologized to my cousin for being so rude and not wanting to give the movie a chance at first.What I love most about this movie are the twists and turns in the story, the cinematography by the always great Roger Deakins and the incredible acting which not only makes the viewer more invested in the story but also gives off a certain sense of uncomfortable realism. Seeing Hugh Jackman grief, cry and panic makes you want to jump through the screen and into the movie to give him a big hug and tell him that everything is going to be okay.I give this movie an 8,6 but because I am not able to use decimals I have to give it an 8. I will never round a score/grade up to the number above, that would mean that if I was to give a movie a 9,6 it should be given a 10/10 when I give my rating here on IMDb and i refuse to give any movie a 10/10 because that implies that it is perfect and nothing is ever perfect. Something can always be improved.I have with the years recommended this movie numerous times to many different people. This is a drama/thriller that makes the viewer sit on the edge of their seat, hold back tears and look on in fear as the desperation of Hugh Jackman\u00b4s character only increases through the duration of the movie.",

The plot focuses on the conflict between a desperated father and a slow investigation by detective Loki, in Anna Dover's missing case. While the father believes Paul Dano is the kidnapper, the police can't prosecute him because they do not have enough evidence.The film is intriguing due to an original screenplay that makes you suspect about every character.

He made one of the most complex and the most intense movies of the last 2010s. If I have to give three movies to explain it; Sicario, Enemy, and this movie Prisoners. For this movie, this is not for the weak stomach and I will say it once, this is so good. This is a complex and deep in the rabbit hole, you will not know who is the good or the evil. By recent years Roger Deakins the cinematographer is collaborating with Dennis Villeneuve which that makes the more better part. This movie will have the cinematography that not a lot of modern day movies will have and that makes it more intense. Prisoners is a modern day classic but not a lot of people will know this classic. So if you think that you are a movie buff and you are into a lot of movies, go see this movie and I bet you, you will be excited to his next work and you will have the best time in recent years for a movie.",

Its very rare to see such dark movies made these days. Credit must me given to the director Denis Villeneuve for making such a masterpiece!The character of Jake Gyllenhall is very convincing as a detective. His eye movements, sharp sentences, dark clothes, all convey a sense of authority and purpose. Even in his confrontations with Jackman, he stands out as the one with the logical arguments. Hugh Jackman could be regarded as the main star of the movie. His role as a kidnapped girl's daughter is just astounding. The tough, but considerate father who'll do anything to find her daughter and wouldn't sit back, is very well portrayed. Paul Dano as a kid 'with an I.Q. of a ten-year old' doesn't for a second lets you take your eyes off of him. You do feel bad for the torture he's being made to undergo, but deep inside you know that he is a culprit and definitely knows something about the location of the girls. Terrence Howard's role stands out like a candle in darkness, serving to remind you of your moral conscience, but his wife is there to counter him. The acting by other characters is also very convincing. The location setting, the weather conditions, the dressing style, all add up in maintaining a grim atmosphere.I would also like to salute the work of J\u00f3hann J\u00f3hannsson, who produced a gripping and tense score for the movie. It just seeps into the background and hits you hard all of a sudden when something major is revealed. Just wonderful!I would strongly recommend movie lovers to go for this movie.",

The story is absolutely superb, with the countless twists and turns throughout the film making me feel as if I were connecting the dots, like a detective. However the actual detective in this film, was a character that well executed in terms of character building, as well as well acted out by Jake Gyllenhaal. However the performance that was just SO captivating, was Hugh Jackman. Hugh Jackman played this character with such conviction and really portrayed his character's rage, depression and sadness throughout the film. The soundtrack, now I though that the soundtrack is something that would fly over most people's heads when reviewing this film, but in the moments of silence with only the music, it truly did send me goose bumps and left my jaw either clenched in suspense and anticipation.

Then, the characters - one of my favorite perfomances by Jake Gyllenhaal ever. Haus character doesn't get much backstory (at least on screen), but Gyllenhaal gives Loki an amazing depth. And Hugh Jackman, I think that masterpiece of acting doesn't even need further explanation.What I also love is the atmosphere. The cold and unforgiving weather underlines how uncomfortable the situation gets as the movie progresses. Beautifully directed by the genius that is Denis Villeneuve.The topic of vigilante justice is one that the film portrays stunningly, without pulling the viewer to a certain side, always feeling for both sides of the story. Also, the religious topic is handled in a very interesting manner.And the ending - i love it. In my Top 5 movie endings of all time.",

            "review_title": "Great cast carry a thin but twisty plot",
            "content": "Great acting, great cinematography, with a good and solid (but not particularly unique) music score.I might also say that about the crime-thriller plot, which certainly keeps up the twists and turns, but for me is let down by some unlikely events. Some events just stretched reality too far for me. Some elements come across as \"by the number\" cop thriller stuff.Some of it had me screaming at TV, WHHATTT?After the 2 girls go missing, our hero Detective Loki is revealed as having never failed to solve a case. OK, so that's reassuring but not really believable.Anyway, a day later his boss is giving him a hard time because he hasn't moved the case forward in 24 hour. They obviously don't like each other. BUt how does this add up so soon after we hear Loki is the star cop. Surely the boss wouldn't be giving a guy a hard time with his 100% success rate.This just feels like this is what happens American cop movies - the boss has to give the hero a hard time.And considering how badly Luki performs in the following case, it would have made far more sense to make him a loser cop in the last chance saloon. Then the bosses attitude would have made sense (and his actions for the rest of the movie).So they bring in the main suspect, Alex Jones, and the father of one of the girls (Hugh Jackman) attacks him in front of half a dozen camera people and news reporters. However, even though they are filming at the time, none of them manage to record the moment where the suspect gives away that he knows where the girls are. You know what reporters are like, they would have been zooming right in.Anyway, the dad is let off by the cops (really? OK, we'll let it go). Then he goes and kidnaps the suspect and locks him in some abandoned property he owns.This goes on for a while and I'm wondering why the suspect hasn't been reported missing. I guess it's not convenient for the plot yet. But eventually there is some vague news that the suspect is now missing.The cops would surely go directly to the dad, seeing as he attacked the suspect in front of about 15 people. But no, it's not the first thing on Luki's mind. Instead the plot meanders on a bit until Loki \"discovers\" Jackman driving to his abandoned house. Surely he would be suspect number 1 at this point and his every move followed by the cops??He then watches Jackman walking towards the place where he has Alex locked up. But he gives himself away by watching him from his parked car, parked in the middle of the road. OK, a minor screw up, but still - this is the guy who solved 100% of his cases remember.The dad is warned when a trucks honks his horn at Loki. Loki chats with the dad and seems to buy his story about wanting to get drunk. But he doesn't trace the path the dad was taking before he was alerted - whhyyy? Are you so dumb, you don't even go and look??This kind of stuff goes on. Loki eventually discovers the abandoned building. But does he get a team of cops to search the entire building, because surely this would be the most obvious place to look for a missing guy who was attacked by the owner.During an interrogation, Loki then allows another suspect to grab his gun and kill himself. How bad is this Loki guy? The 100% record remember. OK, so this awesome cop has developed anger issues since taking on this case. So is this anger issue something he's always had or has it only just surfaced?Another cop movie cliche is that Loki gets to wander around on his own, acting alone, charging into suspects houses without any kind of warrant or permission from the boss. Any cop in reality would have been sacked long before. Certainly after allowing a suspect to take his gun and kill himself.But there's no repercussions, no consequences. Plus a bit of plagiarism from the movie The vanishing at the end. The plot is pretty much the only thing that lets the movie down, however.",

The story line goes like this two girls get abducted, the police end up with two suspects, the parents go insane, and then the person you never thought did it was actually the one who did it. Meanwhile, the dad tortures this poor innocent man that is completely difficult to watch. The gore was too much for me to handle. I understand how the second suspect fits into the picture but I'm not sure his role in the abduction. They never really say; he just there on the side lines doing is own creepy, stalkerish stuff. Also, as a spoiler alert: I don't see the point of the father being abducted in the end either. The movie could easily have removed this part as it has nothing to do with the plot. The ending was terrible. It just ended with really nothing being revealed as if they reached two and half hours and said good enough.

The explanation for why the crimes were committed (I'm trying hard to avoid spoilers) was to make people turn away from god. I believe that most of us know that nearly all child abductions by strangers are sexually motivated, but this movie goes out of its way to assure us that the girls were \"never touched.\" Well, then, why keep them alive, just semi-conscious in the back room or in a hole in the ground? It's as if the terrible violence committed against one innocent in this movie were all the makers felt we could bear; the thought that the survivors had been raped apparently made them more queasy than what was done to a mentally deficient man. Had they been brave enough to allow the completely reasonable sexual motive be behind the crimes, this would have been, for me, a perfect movie.",

            "content": "Prisoners is directed by Denis Villeneuve and stars Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Terence Howard, Paul Dano, and Viola Davis. After two little girls go missing, a father takes matters into his own hands, meanwhile, the detective on the case chases leads into sometimes disturbing places. Prisoners is an incredibly tense and thoughtful film. It is filled with meticulous directing, beautiful cinematography, superb writing, heart-pounding music, seamless editing, and every praise that you can give a film. Hugh Jackman gives a truly Oscar-worthy performance as Keller Dover, the father of one of the missing girls. You can really feel his pain and agony as he desperately goes after the ones he thinks responsible for his daughter's disappearance. Jake Gyllenhaal also gives one his best performances as Detective Loki. As he investigates the disappearance of the two girls, you can empathize with his frustration that comes with a case like this. The film shows the more emotional side of this conflict through Maria Bello, who plays Jackman's wife in the film. Same with Terrence Howard and Viola Davis, who play the parents of the other girl who went missing. It is through those characters that you get to experience sympathy. Paul Dano plays a mentally ill person and a suspect in the investigation. He gives what is considered by many to be his best performance.Prisoners is some of Denis Villeneuve's best work. Roger Deakins, who is arguably the best cinematographer working today, gave his most subtle yet amazing work to date. Not unlike Deakins cinematography, J\u00f3hann J\u00f3hannsson's score is subtle yet flawless. Prisoners showed that subtlety can be an amazing tool when used right. A lot of movies have a loud score and cinematography that makes you think, how did they do that. Prisoners let all of that go for behind the camera work so impeccable that you don't notice it. In the mystery crime-drama genre, Prisoners is as good as they come.Prisoners is a must-watch, so if you haven't seen it go watch it. If you have, let us know your thoughts in the comments.",

'Prisoners' had me leaving the theater shaking my head and questionably contemplating with myself about how far a person would take matter into their own hands.A twisty thriller is one thing, but an unreal case of snakes, mazes, and a serial killing elderly couple who against all odds, were separated by yet again a sex offending pastuer?

Jake Gyllenhaal's hard boiled detective that's played a little more ex-street kid than I expected is great. And the persona and facial ticks he employs to really sell the character would be laughable if done by a lesser actor. Match that with Hugh Jackman's desperate intensity, and you have brilliance. You cannot ask for a better performance, he gives it his all. You truly believe this man is looking for his daughter, and will do whatever he has to to get her back. And Paul Dano, though most of the time ALWAYS looks exactly like he does in this movie, somehow manages to make this performance entirely unique from his others. And no matter what, he always plays a fantastic creep.The cinematography is very subdued. Everything is muted, grey washed, desaturated. It's very observational, the camera being a fly on the wall. But it still has time to be spectacular in how beautiful it can make subdued. Lots of rain dappled silhouettes, reflections, and sub framing. Roger Deakins is a master, and it's remarkable how his style adapts to each film individually. He's not self indulgent in any way, he does what's best for the film.The writing is nearly perfect. There are one or two moments where characters or scenarios play out a little illogically. I won't spoil anything... However, it doesn't detract from the film, just something I noticed.Denis really does well in the neo-noir genre. He can do something like this, gritty and grey, or he can do slick and vibrant like Blade Runner 2049. And ENEMY is another more surreal example of this, also starring Jake Gyllenhaal.All the pieces are here: 10/10.",

I don't want to say to much because this film has to be experienced even now after watching it I'm still not sure how to describe how it made me feel? Dirty? Full of rage? Cathartic? All of those are elements of the viewing experience this film takes you on.

But, if the editors had trimmed a few rough edges, we would have been looking at a real gem.A the performances in this movie are power packed. Hugh Jackman in his determined, hell bent role of a father looking his lost daughter portrays the pain and the loss that a family will face at such trying times. His emotions and the actions he performs, even though it seemed a little over the top at times, was really well brought forth. Jack Gyllehaal in his eccentric detective who is married to his job clich\u00e9 also produces a performance of note although at times it just felt a little forced than natural. The rest of the cast played around well to the central characters, although in essence had so little to do, to produce a good ensemble performance.Bottom line, a good movie which had all the potential of being a really fantastic and brilliant one but fell short due to (in my opinion) a screenplay that could have been helped if it was tad bit faster.",

I was happy to see that I wasn't a complete outlier in feeling so outraged by this movie's popularity that I felt the need to write a review. Apart from Hugh Jackman's brilliant performance (and Jake's was pretty good too), and the fact of the movie's subject - exploring the utilitarian morality of whether torture is ever justified as a means to an end - there isn't really much else that's even remotely praiseworthy. Most annoying to me was how inconsistent the characters were - Alex has the 'IQ of a 10-year old', but manages to drive around fine in his RV, lie to the police officers that he does not know the girls, and yet again, he is playful(and prepared) enough to mutter \"they didn't cry until I left\" when Keller suddenly confronts him! He endures days of torture for no apparent reason before talking about 'mazes'. He randomly strangles his dog while taking it for a walk, and his helplessness suddenly melts away when he attacks Nancy and Keller with a carefully selected shard of glass during his torture! I was also led to believe that this was an Argo-like nail-biting movie. It isn't. I watched this at home and I managed to fast forward a few seconds every now and then because there was no action going on and the director did not even give us anything to chew on during those moments of inactivity. The characters are also way too superficial for my liking. Gyllenhaal plays an insomniac work-obsessed good cop who is always going to scary places all by himself. But that's all we know about him - nothing else of who he is or why he does what he does. And the last one may be because of my lack of a sufficient understanding of American life, but I simply don't get how so many weird f***s like Alex, his mom, and the snake guy manage to eke out a living to maintain a house and a car while pursuing their creepy 'hobbies'.Lately I've noticed a slew of movies that for some odd reason enjoy an unusually high rating of 8+ on IMDb and then turn out to be complete trash...it's disappointing!",

I believe if the film was shorten down to 100-120 minutes (1hr 40mins - 2hrs) then maybe the film would have been more interesting and the suspense would have been felt.All in all, it wasn't a bad film, it did catch my glimpse from time to time, but the pace is what made me and countless of other people feel really bored and distracted upon. i think this film deserves a 6, no less and no more.",

The film is very exciting, the duration of the fiilm is two and a half hours, but they passed very quickly.\nThe plot is not bad, with many plot twists. The story always went in an unexpected direction. There were some plot jambs that confused me a little, for example why at the end the police did not take fingerprints from the Keller's bags that he brought Holly's home, and some more things.\nJake Gyllenhaal and Hugh Jackman are incredible, Paul Dano is also very good. Was very mesmerizing to watch Hugh Jackman acting, I think this is his best role. But I couldn't empathize with the main characters. The rest of the characters were played by good actors, but the characters themselves turned out to be a little empty. For example I would really like to know more about the son of the main character. What I liked the most about the film was the visual. Roger Deakins does his job admirably. Composition of the frame, the color scheme is just magic. Also, I can't help but mention the soundtrack, it is very atmospheric, from which goosebumps.\nIn general, it's not a masterpiece and not the best Denis Villeneuve movie, but it's really great film.

            "content": "This is a very suspenseful film that ironically pivots on the notion that cruelty to animals in one form is a sign of mental illness while in another form is masculine and aligned with God and Country.As you probably know, the film opens with a father saying a prayer just as he and his son kill a deer. From that point forward, the hunter and god-loving father is pitted against another character who, among other things, tortures a dog. We are provided with a number of scenes where animals, patriotism, faith are emphasized. One scene is when the hunter brings venison to his family's friends' dinner party and the veterinarian mother remarks that she can't cut the \"meat\" since she is a veterinarian. The veterinarian's daughters asks the hunter's son, \"don't you feel bad\" about killing an animal, to which the son replies, \"my dad would say 'do you feel bad eating a McDonald's hamburger'?\" I said all of this symbolism relating to animal cruelty is ironic because an actual deer was killed in the first scene. It wasn't a pretend killing, but a real one. At the end of the film, the Humane Association disclaimer states that it \"monitored SOME of the animal action and no animals were harmed in THOSE scenes.\" Clearly, the AHA monitored the scene where the anti-hero chokes a dog, NOT the scene where the deer was killed.Of course, the producers \"pragmatically\" thought that it is okay to kill a deer since hunters routinely do that and the main character is a hunter. Not in my book. Killing is wrong. It is especially wrong when it is for nothing more than a scene in a movie. Movies are fake. They are fakes of reality. So, real killing does not belong in fake realities.Animal cruelty and associated allegories and symbols figure prominently throughout the film. I am discounting the layers of meaning and symbolism in the film, but only the actual death of an animal.",

The true body of the movie comes from the outstanding performances depicting the emotional journey of the victims of such crimes.Hugh Jackman blows it out of the water with a faultless portrayal of a grieving father, desperate and full of rage. Jake Gyllenhaal gives us an unnervingly cold and brutal detective, skilled and effective, but weighed down by his demons making him violent and short tempered. The two play off each other outstandingly, launching forward the film into an emotional, chaotic (but never messy) battle of wills.Overall I have to say I enjoyed this film greatly. It was definitely worth the watch (and a rewatch), but it is not a showcase of the bold and brilliant detective work such as you might find in Silence of the Lambs or Seven. It will leave you thinking, realising how human life is as fragile as it is valuable and perhaps you'll come away softened slightly to the families and victims of horrendous crime.",

Judging by his performance in this film I find this very hard to believe, and wouldn't trust to investigate a shoplifting let alone an abduction of 2 kids.A guy with a mental age of 10 is able to endure over a week of torture without dropping his aunt in it. Some guy collects kids cloths and covers them in pigs blood, and places them in a suitcase full of snakes for no apparent reason.One of the kids manages to escape but we don't really know how.No real motive for the kidnapping.The viewer has no empathy for the family or children as no bond is established, at one point I briefly forgot that two kids had been kidnapped.The significance of the 'Maze' was never explained.I could go on but I've wasted 153 mins of my life watching this film so don't propose to waste any more.",

You see one destroyed, desperate father willing to do anything to save his daughter and you sympathize with him even when you see that there is no limit that he wouldn't cross just to see his loved ones safe. Every single scene of this movie has it's meaning because it represents a part of a brilliant puzzle which unravels slowly to reveal such disturbing ending. Remarkable acting is followed by fantastic music and all those parts put together make this movie mind-blowing! It can't leave you indifferent. You will stay speechless, confused, sad and happy at the same time - it'll give you a full mix of different emotions. I would recommend everybody to watch this movie.

            "content": "At first glance \"Prisoners \" is what most critics and viewers would hail as a brilliant film. I myself would have thought the same thing 10 years or more ago when I was an aspiring young film critic. However, with age comes wisdom and I found \"Prisoners\" quite disturbing, quite sickening.Prisoners tells the story of two families the Dovers and the Birches who while celebrating thanksgiving manage to have both of their young daughters kidnapped the same night. Jake Gyllenhaal plays the seasoned Detective Loki, assigned to what must be the most trying case of his career. Hugh Jackman plays patriarch Keller Dover a supposed Christian and ironically a carpenter who has taught his family to hope for the best, but be prepared for the worst. In the hours after the kidnapping, with view leads and what he views as an incompetent police investigation Keller slowly slides into the deepest abyss of morality all in an effort to find the would be kidnappers. Keller also enlists the aid of fellow grieving patriarch Franklin Dover ( played by Terrance Howard) to assist him in his nefarious plot to retrieve both their missing daughters.I can't imagine the thought of having a daughter go missing, however from a Christian perspective it seems the reaction of The Keller is rather anti-Christian. Part of that is the whole theme of the movie. Nevertheless, I think from a true Christian perspective , a father would never sink to the lows if Keller Dover if his child were kidnapped. The response may not be automatic, but much prayer would follow such a devastating kidnapping and also a trust in an all powerful God that no matter what the outcome that God is still in control. Even if it means that one's child might pass, there is a satisfaction in knowing that Jesus will someday bring that child back.However, on film the Keller's cuss and argue. Faith in God is completely shaken once the youngest child is missing and no one is praying, until the very end during a sad cinematic twist. This is a film wrapped in darkness and it shows the true ugliness of humanity. After watching \"Prisoners\" I regretted allowing this film into my psyche for over two hours . It was very unsettling and shook me to the core. Yes there are horrors in this world, but do we as an audience need too feed off of sure horrors and better yet, should we? A film as bleak as this one was felt oddly demonic, perhaps Detective Loki was name appropriately so, with Loki being the evil god of malice and mischief, because this film was a trickster of sorts maligning Christianity and mingling it with all that is frail and sinister.",

Up to the first half of this movie, we see a believable portrayal of what any father would do in his position, to find his daughter at any cost blaming the obvious target of the local kid who has a few issues in the mental department. Again, all believable.It is in the second half of the film, it starts to breakdown a little, Gyllenhaall, the detective that has \"never failed a case\" decides to tail Jackman due to the local kid going missing and he being the obvious target due to various altercations with the police and the kid believing he knows where his daughter is kept.There are a few silly mistakes, if Mr Gyllenhaal is such a great detective, how come he gets given away by a truck wanting to get passed him when he tailing Jackman?We also see one of the children escape or be released tbh, I have still no idea, there is a note left saying if you can solve the maze you go home? what the hell happened? i still don't know. The maze was supposed to be unsolvable....Finally, Jackman gets thrown down a hole and at no times mentions the fact to the 70 year old that just managed to get the better of him that he has her son locked away and she won't see him again either????? why?????Finally, there doesn't seem to be any motive for the kidnapping, I remembered to the start of the movie that jackman says they have no money, was this a bizarre insurance scam? no it was some 70 year old nutter.... please ! my five year old could come up with a more feasible plot.As normal, acting is good, but the plot is just plain silly. it ruined a potentially good movie.",

Everyone did a fantastic job, but Paul Dano and Hugh Jackman stole the whole thing. They gave Oscar-worthy performances. I also give credit to DP Roger Deakins for the amazing visuals. The highlight of his work was during the rush to the hospital near the end. Simply phenomenal. I wasn't just at the edge of my seat; I was out of it, my eyes glued to the screen and fists clenched.

The girl was sleeping in a locked room! come on! while on the other hand the detective checks the priest's house and the second suspect' house very thoroughly.The second hole is the maze. where is the maze?! why would Alex make reference to the maze when there is none? the necklace and the drawings are not convincing.also the second suspect role.. what is his connection to the girls? he has their cloths so is he an ex-victim now cooperating with the aunt? you don't have to tell everything but that is a bit too loose end for my taste.It is a shame because this movie could have really been awesome if the details were more accurate.",

But ultimately, it was unfathomable to believe that the old lady would leave her house unlocked for anyone to come in and find her admistering an injection into her kidnapping victim.There was so much build up, the maze was just used symbolically, but never meant anything much substantive. They left too many loose ends to make it flawless. I would have rather liked a more subtle uncovering of the actual suspect than such open and shut ending.Simply a waste of a nice script. A 6 out of 10 is more appropriate than a 8.1 IMDb rating.",

There's no waiting around in this one, the story starts evolving from the off-set playing off Hugh Jackman's greatest performance of his career to date. The perfect balance in fear and anger brings home that feeling you dread to relate to by situation. A very touchy subject for a storyline but not one to miss with again an exceptional performance from Paul Dano.Considering the length of the film and the type of film that is perceived through the audience eyes there is no 'dragging' or slowed down 'filler' parts of the movie. It's simply is one of those 'edge of your seat' thrillers, terrifying yet you don't want it to stop. Jake Gyllenhaal's performance is memorable. An interesting take on a nowadays detective. A cold yet relatable character. Very well written. If you're looking for an in-depth realistic story following a missing child and a protective father look no further, this one will sure whet your appetite.",

There were a lot of plot holes. Jake Gylenhaal and Paul Dano though did amazing. They were great in characters. Overall and okay film to watch.

The performances are outstanding and every character feels real and lends to the film. Hugh Jackman plays a stern father who lies in a gray area of morality, and is worn down as the film progresses. Viola Davis, Terrance Howard, Paul Dano, Melissa Leo, and the other cast members are incredible each in their own ways. But who really stands out is Jake Gyllenhaal, as a twitchy, aggressive, young detective with secrets. His interactions with the other characters and the situation is beautiful and perfect. Rodger Deakins spectacular cinematography creates a dreary yet beautiful world for the characters to play in and makes the film perfect.

Forest Whitaker would have been better as the detective.(even with his sleepy looks). Though the storyline tries to maintain an element of surprise and tension for the greater part of the movie the enactment was too slow and did not have the gripping effect that good thriller movies provide. It is not the edge of the seat kind of movie ..rather a movie where u relax and stretch yourself several times waiting to get up from the seat.The story gets jumbled and the movie looses its grip in the second half. Does not deserve the high 8 rating.. definitely not!! Would like to avoid this kind of dull dragging movies.....Watch at home ....However i won't ask for my money back..they don't give anyway :)",

I started watching this accidentally one day and then ended up streaming it later to finish watching, so it was enough out of the gate to keep me interested. Several things I do not get (SPOILERS), such as: 1) Why did the one suspect kill himself in the police station when it was obvious he wasn't the kidnapper? 2) They explained the \"boy\" had mental problems and had the iq of a 10- year old. They showed a scene where he signed his name, clearly understanding what he was told. Yet he wouldn't say one word to he police and then to the father about the girls despite getting beaten over several days. Even a 10-year old understands the situation. 3) How did they find the black girl? It was never mentioned how she got away, just that \"they found her\". 4) When the black girl spoke to the father, why wasn't she questioned before that? Why were there no police there already in the room to protect her and question her? 5) The black girl gave him a clue as the location of where they were held, enough that he knew where to go. They then show the police chasing after him to stop him. What grounds did they have to stop him from doing anything when they didn't know anything about what he knew or where he was going? Why didn't he tell them to follow him if he was so damn sure? 6) When he entered the woman's house, he turns his back to her knowing full well she was the kidnapper. When he went there, I was anticipating how he would handle it, coming out directly at first or just playing it sly. He had a gun, it should have been accessible from the moment he knocked on the door and you never let them out of your sight!",

Those types of viewers aren't able to simply enjoy a flick; instead they spend their entire time looking for problems in a movie - therefore their reviews need to be disregarded because the only type of movie that could ever convince them is one taken from a live cell phone for 2 hours of some real-time event like a city-held event such as a parade or something. There is a lot of \"red herrings\" during the middle part of the movie, but all of them have you wondering which one of them is \"the kidnapper\". This effectively removes any suspicion you might have about who the real perpetrator might be.Back to the movie - nail-biting, suspenseful and intense. Excellent acting. Great plot line. Jackman delivers an awesome performance, and his anger is portrayed very well. Jake is portrayed as a hero in the ending and you can't help but think \"humble hero\" in your mind when you see his performance at the end. If you're the type that's going to sit there for all 2.5 hours and just look for errors, then don't bother watching, and don't bother watching any other movie for that matter, because you're obviously incapable of enjoying any film. But if you can sit back and enjoy a good flick and allow yourself to engage into a world of storytelling, then this film will not let you down. Highly recommended for movie-goers that aren't so \"literal\" and know how to enjoy a good flick.",

It just needs the story to be slightly smarter. The problem...one of the characters looks and feels out of place. And midway through I suddenly realised as I'm sure many did, it was that character that was ultimately going to be behind everything.

This is even more impressive knowing that the plot is very simple and even generic at some parts. Apart from the aforementioned duo, almost every actor knocks it out of the park. When Hugh Jackman, who gave a career best performance, acts on screen, you don't see an actor reading his lines, you don't see even a speck of wolverine, all you see is a broken father willing to do anything just to get his daughter back.So, when i asked earlier what differentiates this movie, i can easily say it is some of the very best acting i have ever seen (no exaggeration), complimented by a strong script and direction.Strongly Recommended.",

I would say the film dragged on a little through the middle but did think it was need at times.

They are the cream of the crop and it's hard to imagine other actors doing their roles better. Combine them with Viola Davis, Terrence Howard, Denis Villeneuve, and a tantalizing plot, and you have sheer brilliance. Even though the movie is 2 1/2 hours long, it feels like it, but it's completely gripping. The twists are not something one will see coming until you're supposed to because details are kept out. The entire cast does a fantastic job! There's no overacting or roles that are too small. This really is an experience that is all encompassing and emotionally immersive. I am tired afterwards, but the emotions you'll experience aren't going to go away after the movie is over. This is not a family movie and I wouldn't recommend it to any minors or young adults. It is a movie that I feel every adult should watch that can handle it's tough subject matter.In modern society, there is a massive problem that isn't talked about enough and it's crimes against children. There is one quote that particularly stuck with me: \"Making children disappear is the war we wage with God.

There are many scenes in vivid detail where people are being beaten and tortured; the director does not suggest these details in any subtle way whatsoever. And the fact that the whole premise revolves around the kidnapping, drugging, and harming children just makes it unbearable. Maybe some people appreciate the realness, I typically am one of those people, but this was a little too far for me.",

I'll concede you get information using it, but often quite unreliable information as the victim concocts anything they can think of to stop the torture. Especially in a situation of uncertain guilt, it is a really stupid way to proceed. And I hate brutality being glorified.Other than that, the film has an excellent cast who give excellent performances. But the plot is dumb in my opinion.

During interrogation, Loki realizes Alex's diminished IQ prevents him from planning a kidnapping and learns that his RV contains no forensic evidence of the missing girls. The police captain releases Alex to his aunt, Holly. Convinced of Alex's guilt, Keller assaults him outside the police station, where Alex whispers to him, \"they didn't cry until I left them\". Keller kidnaps Alex, and along with a very reluctant Franklin Birch, Joy's father, begins to torture Alex in an empty building Keller owns.Loki tails Keller to the empty building, where Keller claims he goes to drink, but Loki leaves before he can find Alex. Loki later arrests a man, Bob Taylor, for breaking into the Dover and Birch houses; at Taylor's house, Loki discovers walls covered in maze drawings and crates filled with snakes and bloody children's clothes. Taylor confesses to the kidnappings, and Loki discovers he was abducted as a child. As Taylor draws detailed mazes, Loki assaults him and demands the location of the girls. Two other officers pull him off of Taylor, and during the struggle, Taylor grabs an officer's gun and kills himself. The parents identify photos of the clothes as Joy's and Anna's.Keller continues torturing Alex, who cryptically talks about escaping from a maze. Keller visits Holly, learning that Alex's intellectual disability comes from a childhood accident involving the pet snakes her husband kept. Holly and her husband lost their faith in religion after their son died of cancer, and adopted Alex as a way to cope.At Taylor's house, Loki learns that many of the bloody clothes were store-bought and soaked with pigs blood. Below a window outside the Dover house, Loki finds Taylor's footprints and the same kind of sock Keller identified from Taylor's house.",

In the movie channel version the movie ends with detective Loki hearing a whistle at Alex's house but then walking off screen. The rented version I remember had him recognizing that the car had been moved and finding Keller in the hole followed by Keller's trial and acquittal. What's up? Are my husband and I just making things up or was the movie released with alternate endings????? It's been driving us crazy and I don't see any mention of alternate endings anywhere in the IMDb information.",

            "content": "Admittedly, I hadn't read the synopsis before watching this film, so I thought it was a coming of age drama starring Jackman and Minette. It was a genuinely terrifying surprise. My heart dropped through my entire body and my mouth went dry. That was my state for most of the movie. Prisoners is a justifiably unsettling film. It does a great job of building tension and keeping the stakes high right until the very end. I had so many different emotions while watching, most of them resulting in tears. It was so hard to watch, but impossible for me to tear myself away.The writing is near perfect, and the performances by each actor really has you second guessing who the bad guy really is. Every word of dialogue could be a lie, or it could be the most pertinent information of the whole case. The ending few scenes had so many \"aha!\" Moments that my mind was blown.A brilliant thing about this movie, and my favourite element of a good crime drama, is that all of the clues are there for you to follow along. We see everything that Jake Gyllenhaal's detective sees, and more. Denis Villeneuve doesn't talk down to his audience. He shows you everything and let's you think for yourself.Only one thing had me suspend my disbelief. Jake Gyllenhaal walks excruciatingly slowly throughout the movie. I am aware that it builds more anticipation, but it made me lose focus in every one of those scenes. He also does up his shirt all the way up like an American Liam Gallagher. It's definitely a choice.Having never lived in America, I cant attest to the accuracy of the sets or costumes, but they seem perfectly humdrum and mediocre. I mean this as the biggest compliment, but I would never expect anything interesting to happen in that town or with those people. They are such real people.Overall, this movie is a tough watch. It's extremely graphic at points and psychologically draining. Make sure you're in the right headspace before watching. This movie deserves an 8.5 out of 10, but I'll round it up to 9.",

His ultimate lack of energy or pace was mind numbing to say the least and with such an incredible cast it was embarrassing that they hardly had anything to do with the story. Jackmans wife was in bed the whole time and the other family were completely overlooked. I could go on and on about this terrible story line that never really made any sense and left 2.5 hours of unanswered questions and pointless plot twists.

            "content": "OK, so this contains spoilers but I will not say a lot.First of all, as someone else on the message boards wrote this movie is just PERFECT if you want to understand whether someone has an understanding of movies or just generally *smart*. The movie contains at least a couple plot holes and a **ton** of stuff just to fill the gaps. I will give some examples. 1-Why did Alex, who didn't even say a word after all that interrogation just randomly spouts that stupid \"They didn't cry until I left them\". Like what? How dumb is this line. Just think about it, first of all how does he know that he is one of the fathers of the girls. Even if he does know somehow, let's say he saw them from the van, why the hell would you say that to him, and there? Literally anyone could've heard them. There's like 20 people around them, but oh no...2-Going with Alex again, why did he break at the end? Why? This guy literally beat you half to death. Couldn't hit you one more time without killing you, he showered you with boiling water, let you live with your own filth for I don't know how many days. Why the hell in the end would you break *at that perfect time* at the end? So stupid of the writers. 3-How can they not check the ID of someone they take into custody FOR KIDNAPPING OF 2 CHILDREN.!!!! Like what the hell. How dumb is this thing. I called the entire ending the moment they showed the first boy who was kidnapped, and I am sure anyone with a little bit of intelligence did the same. Unless you watched like a couple movies in your life time and you think this movie deserves an 8.1.4-Another thing, why would Keller have his gun in his bag. You tortured someone for 7~ days. Are you afraid to kill the person you are almost *sure* that kidnapped your daughter? Lets say he wanted to hide the gun, why is it not on him? Holly didn't even search him. 5-Oh, oh. I'm adding this after writing everything because it just occurred to me. HOW DUMB is the character Bob Taylor? Maybe I don't understand but please someone tell me. Why would he take the blame for everything? Why would he steal those girls clothes just to make them look like they died? Why would he commit suicide in the first place? Even Holly said she FORGOT about him. Goddamn what the hell.6-I'm sure there is a lot more to say about this *thing* but one last thing. People. Please. Stop. Arguing. Whether. Detective Loki, heard the whistle or not.OF COURSE HE DID, did you watch the ending or did you fall asleep?!He looks around after the 3rd time he hears the whistle, and after the 4th time he literally locks on to a direction! You should be able to deduct that he knows something is up. Just because whoever's genius idea it was to leave it like that, they didn't show him being rescued and put to prison, doesn't mean you shouldn't even pay attention, like god damn.After all this I gotta say, I bashed the movie pretty hard, but it deserved it. Also I should add that after all that stupid bulls*it I still kind of enjoyed the movie. If those dumb plot holes could've been filled with actual writing, this movie would've then deserved an 8.1 or even higher. Maybe not higher. Like I said, EVERYONE saw that ending coming from a mile away.",

Why did that woman wanted to kill the children again? She talked about some kind of demons, she related this whole thing to religion obviously which I don't mind, and I liked her comparing the parents to demons, but what the hell was this 3 hour long movie?

It's a roller coaster ride of emotions in which you eventually ask yourself whether the roles of good and evil are really as clear as previously suspected or not.Prisoners has a plot into which everyone could really put himself. In my opinion, this is rarer than some people would think. It's the story of a loving father (Hugh Jackman), whose 6-year-old daughter disappears without a trace.I don't want to reveal too much, but I would like to come back to my introduction, in which I no longer claim to know who is \"evil and good\" at some point.\nI would like to say that you should pay close attention to the character developments of the characters during the course of the film.The cast of the film is spotless and perfect. The two protagonists deliver both very strongly. Hugh Jackman plays phenomenal and Jake Gyllenhaal embodies an equally strong roleMy only criticism would be that the whole thing is moving a little too slow. That's not quite unusual for crime novels, because it stimulates the tension, but in my opinion Prisoners is dragged a little too slowFor a film of this genre, an absolute 9/10\nFor a film in the world of films, an 8.5/10",

Denis Villeneuve went on to Sicario and other excellent films; revisiting this now, I hoped to see what I'd missed the first time, hoping it cohered more than I remembered and that I could be more in line with the prevailing good opinion of the film. \n\nMuch of those things to admire remain, especially Roger Deakins's predictably brilliant cinematography. Shot by a lesser talent, it's probable that the film's atmosphere would be considerably less brooding and uncomfortable. My problem with the central criminal's motivation remains - without descending to spoilers, such situations send at least as many in the opposite direction as they do in the general direction that the villain has gone. \n\nHugh Jackman's performance doesn't work (it's far from subtle); Gyllenhaal is better, but his tics seem a little corny. There's little to counteract the problem of Sicario, that the central female character is underwritten; here the wives are adjuncts and those who wait for their men to do what men will do.  None of this makes the film less atmospheric or detracts from the artistry; it's just that for me it's not quite the film it wants to be or that Sicario and his other later films would turn out to be.",

I liked the way Hugh Jackman gave himself to the role, his performance is good here, but ends up being hampered by a weak script, which throws up several loose ends during 2h30 of the film and takes the one that fits best at the end, throwing it away the others.",

As did having a cast of talented actors such as Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Paul Dano, Viola Davis and Melissa Leo.\n\n'Prisoners' almost lives up to the acclaimed hype with most of the film being absolutely exceptional, but doesn't quite make it. Its only major stumbling block is that it spirals out of control towards the end, the tension does slip, there are big lapses in credibility and characters' actions and morality issues become implausible and much less believable. Having been so impressed with the rest of the film, this was a real pity. Maybe it is a little overlong too.\n\nOn the other hand, Roger Deakins shows again why he is one of the best contemporary cinematographers in the business with cinematography that's stunning and darkly gritty, also bringing out the visceral horror. The production values in general are impeccably audacious and deeply haunting and the editing is suitably stylish.\n\nJohannsson's music score is suitably ominous and pulse-pulsating, one can actually feel their heart beat with tension and anticipation.\n\nVilleneuve's directing has a beautiful darkness but also a hard edge that is perfect for the story.\n\nWhile the script is not quite as taut as that for 'Sicario', it does provoke thought and its unsettled nature hits hard. The story is not perfect, but a vast majority of it is nail-biting in tension, frightening in its suspense and very much edge of your seat. It is very violent and is not for the faint hearted because it is so vivid and the turn of events are unpredictable and devastating. It's deliberate in pacing but never dull, despite slacking towards the end.\n\nCharacters are interesting, especially Jackman's increasingly unpredictable Keller Dover. You don't condone what he's done and his actions are extreme and one can sort of understand why he resorts to such drastic measures.\n\nJackman is at his most hard-hitting, a shocking atypical performance that is among his best. Gyllenhaal is firm and understated, Dano is at his most unnerving and at times affecting and Terrence Howard gives one of the best performances he's ever given (showing that with the right material, like here, that he can be good).\n\nDavis and Leo, as to be expected, are outstanding, as is a poignant Maria Bello.\n\nIn summary, 'Prisoners' may be long in length yet high in suspense and tension. It had all the makings of an exceptional film, and actually was for most of its running time, but that the ending disappoints as much it does it goes down to being a very good one. 8/10 Bethany Cox",

The plot is basically about the disappearance of two girls and the investigation that ensues and the relationship between one of the fathers and the lead detective.

Everything, and I really mean everything is well tought and well put together. Roger Deakins again nails with the cinematography. There is literally not a single frame i would change.\n\nThe acting is from another world. Hugh Jackman is top notch, the range of this man in this movie is incredible and comes to show how talented he really is. I feel like I have nothing to say about Gyllenhaal because he is fucking incredible in every movie he does, but he was specially good in here. Viola Davis and Maria Bello were great and portrayed the role of desperate and hopeless mothers so well. The biggest surprise in this movie was Paul Dano. The man can act!\n\nPrisoners is a fascinating crime story. It has a lot a foreshadowing and deep symbolism. Every line and every shot are important to the story and that's what makes this film so great. It's very unpredictable, which is perfect in a crime/thriller movie. It is a masterpiece and it's Villeneuve's work at his finest. One of the best movies of the 10s and my second favorite from Denis, only after Blade Runner 2049.",

On many occasions the camera lingers in certain scenes to either build tension or allow the viewer to take in what is on show. \n\nAs mentioned, Prisoners (2013) is both a beautiful and horrible movie in the sense at how well it is shot and uses the dialogue efficiently, whilst also displaying how far a father would go to protect his daughter. Hugh Jackman's rage shines through making him terrifying to watch, instantly grabbing your attention.\n\nPrisoners (2013) is a tense film from start to finish thanks to Denis Villeneuve's directorial style of showing and telling the story, not to mention fierce performances from all actors and actresses involved.

The score is chilling, haunting, but also beautiful at the same time, it enhances a scene for the better, making it suspenseful, sad, or scary. The cinematography is amazing, the shots in this movie can make you feel the entire scene and absorb everything you are seeing without any cuts ruining it, and it can also make you feel claustrophobic at times. Some scenes in this movie had me on the edge of my seat and my heart pounding because of how gripping a certain scene was, and I only watched this movie on my small iPhone 7 screen. This isn't a horror movie, but sometimes I would squint or get scared because a scene would be that heavy. This movie is a mystery, and is not predictable at all, it deals with family and trauma, and explores how far a man would go to save a  family member. This movie also has tons of symbolism, whether it's purposeful or not. And the ending\u2026 oh my god the ending\u2026 It's hard to describe in words what emotions you go through in the ending, but at the same time I don't want to spoil it, so I'll just say that the ending was cool. But this is probably the best directed movie ever, thanks to Denis Villeneuve, one of the my favorite directors of all time, after watching this movie. This is my favorite movie of all time.",

His first three, August 32nd on Earth, Maelstr\u00f6m, and Polytechnique, weren't very good for me, and only until his 4th, Incendies, which I pretty recently watched, did Villeneuve got the right budget to make great movies. \n\nI watched Prisoners a while ago, and I remembered not really digging it. However, after this rewatch, I totally loved this movie. First of all, Hugh Jackman's intense performance outshined everyone else. The way his character lost his humanity while trying to find the answer was both heartbreaking and terrifying. Jake Gyllenhaal was also great with his change in demeanor as a cop. The way he smiled at first and then turned violent got on my nerve a little bit. \n\nThe story itself was intense, slow, yet intriguing. For 2 hours and 30 minutes, I did not feel bored, and only got more gripped into the story as the movie progressed. It did not feel long. The plot was a harsh look at the way people lost their faith or tried to cling to their faith without losing themselves to hatred. \n\nProbably the best aspect that elevated the mystery was the maze symbol that became more apparent toward the end. Not only was it integral to the plot, but the mazes without a way out also served as prisons that the characters got stuck in. Some got imprisoned in captivity, childhood trauma, revenge, finding answers, and hatred of God.\n\nOverall, an amazing and gripping thriller that I wanted more of. 9/10",

            "content": "Prisoners - 10/10. Denis Villeneuve debuted into Hollywood with this terrifically intense crime drama. Shot incredibly by the legend Roger Deakins and with superb performances from Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Paul Dano, Terrence Howard, and Melissa Leo, Prisoners is an excellent thriller which follows both the victim's and police's storylines. Its quite an intense and raw film, and really plays up the tension and intensity of the story. Its an incredible film, which helped launch the career of Villeneuve and catapult him to the upper echelons of directing talent. Whats great about Prisoners is that it doesn't shy away from the hardships that a kidnapped child's parents' would go through. Jackman plays the role of a distraught father on a mission to find his child extremely well. This is by far his best performance of his career. His rage is real and you can feel he put a lot of energy into this character. Gyllenhaal as the cop gives a really underrated performance in this film, and Leo gives a really good and creepy performance. But by far the best aspect of this film is Deakins's cinematography. How he captures the cold and dark nature of the story really shows the legend's mindset in terms of filming sequences. This film is probably my fave Villeneuve film, and one that deserves more attention than his other work in my opinion.",

            "content": "Prisoners is one of these films that will make you spend 2 hours and then surprise you in the last 30 minutes. A great film that has great acting performances, cinematography, directing, screenplay, and everything. \n\nPrisoners really surprised me with everything. Didn't expect the film to go to where it's going. Its story is so great and I believe that's thanks to the build-up that took 2 hours. Although it's a long time. But, in the end, it will all make sense and the pieces are all put together perfectly. Every film is famous for a specific scene but it's hard to find one in this film because there are so many so it's hard to pick. I'll be honest, at the first, I didn't like that the film was taking too much time to tell the story and it was giving us one piece after the other but at the end, we were able to put all of them together and it gave us a masterpiece.\n\nI believe that this is Jake Gyllenhaal's second-best performance (Nightcrawler being the first). He was able to present Detective Loki in such a unique way that only Jake himself is able to play. For those who don't know, Detective Loki's tattoos, rings, and rapid blinking were all Jake Gyllenhaal's ideas. I believe that the rings and the tattoos have meanings behind them which makes Detective Loki an interesting character that we all want to know more about. Now for Hughe Jackman,  I believe that this is his best performance even better than Wolverine. In many scenes, you could feel his pain as a father who lost his daughter especially in those scenes where he was screaming and yelling at the top of his lungs. You can feel the pain in his voice. Overall, the acting in this film is ON POINT.\n\nDenis Villeneuve's way of directing this film is very unique. He was able to give us drama, Thriller, Crime, and many more using his directing and the little small details that you might think don't matter but they all will at the end. Roger Deakins with his great cinematography/camera movements were beautiful, the film really has many shots that are beautiful. Also, the colors and the editing really helped to give the audience that thriller/crime vibe. \n\nOverall, this film has everything. Acting, cinematography, editing, directing, and even the music/soundtrack may be the most part that many didn't notice. But, in some scenes, you could hear the beautiful soundtrack of J\u00f3hann J\u00f3hannsson playing in the background and giving you that suspense/thriller feel. Great film that the more you get deep into it and notice the little details, the more you like it. \n\nMy rating is 9/10",

            "content": "Certainly watchable, with intriguing characters and Villeneuve's trademark flair that we also see in Enemy and Blade Runner 2049. Gyllenhaal is reliably superb, while Jackman does his best despite delivering what some might see as an overly shouty, belligerent performance and scattershot lines making it difficult for the audience to sympathize with him. Viola Davis offers up a surprisingly complex supporting role. Paul Dano also steals the show in the few scenes that he has. The final payoff didn't quite warrant the two-ish hours before it of slow, painful buildup.\n\nThe ambition of the film makes it worth the watch, which perhaps isn't the greatest argument. The themes of internal and external prisons, along with religion are intriguing enough to allow for thoughtful reflection despite dissatisfaction with a few plot points. The priest was an example of missed potential, while the main red herring of the mystery convoluted the plot and seemed an artificial implant rather than a worthwhile diversion. \n\nI simply enjoy that Prisoners builds multiple characters well in order to explore the implications and effects of a kidnapping upon those close to the victims. The effort is not perfect or unblemished, but this indirectly adds to the humanity surrounding the film. The visual style and good suspense also bump this one up to a positive rating.",

            "content": "This is this kinda movie, that makes you really angry while watching it. The Plot has a great start and it feels really suspensfull. After a while you start noticing some things that seem very... weird or out of character. On this step it only gets worse. Youll notice more and more things. These arent some plotholes. The whole movie builds on coincidences and stupidity of the characters. \n\nthe acting of jake and hugh are great. Probably the only thing that was great.\n\nSpoiler:\n\nFirst of all. Why has the detective no partner? A Partner would like... make total sense. Okay. Ill start right after the police got the kid but he isnt answering to anybody. Except to the father when he got released. Because...? yup, theres no excuse at all in the end. It doesnt make sense. He told him that something that makes him the prime suspect in the case. Spoiler: No one cared about him. Literally. The police not believing anything is only the cherry on the cake. Okay. Noted. Its even noted that the police is looking everywhere. Except in the house of the kidnapper. Ok. Given, theres no trace at all - even with dogs - that the children were ever in this house. MAYBE the tracks of the abandoned car only moving 3 meters would make anyone with half a brain thinking \"why would anyone move this car recently? maybe Ill look under it.\". Nope. No one will notice these tracks. Not even with a full team in the end thats currently digging the whole garden to find dinosaurs. They cant find anything. Ok. No Tracks. Noted.\n\nTheres a new suspect, he flew from the police after he touched a teddy. Now theres only one suspect. No one cares about the first suspect, they don't even watching him. Because...? yeah. He wasnt  it, because he didnt admit it. Check. Via pure luck a witness saw the new suspect and could give the police the tag of his car. \n\nThey find him at home. Better call the detective and drive away as far as we can.\n\nThe detective arrived at the house of the suspect. Everyone currently thinks: This is it. There are the kids. SWAT should arrive soon but instead:\n\nNOT EVEN ONE POLICE CAR WAS AT THIS HOUSE. The detective entered ALONE the house of the suspect. A Partner would come in handy, but that would make the movie less suspensful. Ok. Given.\n\nMeanwhile the first kidnapper got kidnapped by the father. Somehow the kidnapper  manages to withstand 24/7 tortue and breaks only after 7 Days and tells him they were in the maze. How would this kid doesnt tell anything in the first couple of days? Besides the cheap movie trick \"better let the kid misstreat an animal before he got kidnapped, so the viewer agrees with this whole torture thing.\" \n\nOk. Even given that. The detective now follows the father, because maybe he has anything to do with the kidnappers missing.  Where would you hide if you followed someone in a car. The best place would be.... in the middle of a crossing in traffic. Smartest thing to do: Just wait. After a while a truck arrives and honks loudly. The father noticed him (no shit) and didnt lead him into his secret house. \n \nSomehow now the detective thinks: The only way to find his hideout is reading the newspaper of the last years that contained the name of the father. Obviously he finds the adress and drives to this house. Again: Alone. \nSo he breaks into the hideout. Knocking? Why? This doesnt make any sense. He only knocks on houses when hes locking for a suspect involved kidnapping children. This is something serious: A random person may or may not have been kidnapped. \n\nSo hes in the house and finds the father sleeping on the ground. he wakes him up and aks what up. \"yeah, im sleeping way better in this creepy house on a cold floor than at home\". Detective \"yeah, cool, can you show me around?\". Father. \"well, of course, I have only kidnapped and tortured someone upstairs. I could of course ask for a search permit or why you are even in my house - but the better thing to do is showing you everything\"\n\nYadayada - The cop is just one room away from the kidnapper. His phone rings and: \n\nOne children could escape after 7 days. How? Uhm. She ran away.\n\nGood, we should stop looking at this house and drive fast with separate cars to the hospital. Its a good thing that I have a police car with blue light and you got a car. \n\nProbably the reason because the father arrived way earlier than the detective. \n So, father in the room and asks the child anything about clues etc. \nThe kid now tells the father that she have seen him. Perfect clue. The father clicks and thinks:\"well, I was at the mothers house - OF COURSE\". So he rushes to the exit. Police is suspicious, \"block the exits!\" \"lock the hospital down, all units check every exit!\"\n\nSo the father escapes without a scene and drives to the house of the lady. yeah, no one is following him, he escaped the hospital so we cant follow him. \n\nFather arrives at the house and asks the nice lady if he can come in to fix anything in the house. The lady naturally agrees, this wouldnt be weird at all. \nThe father proceeds to put all his tools on the kitchen counter and doesnt watch the lady at all. Why would he? So he said \"I dont want to hit you\" and turns around at looks into the smallest .22 caliber gun in the universe. Picture this: He stands 2 meters to the lady. Hugh fucking Jackman build like a bear against a small women with a very tiny revolver. He could easily move or try something - because lets be real: This thing wont stop him.  But Nope. He does everything what she demands, even including drinking a knockout cocktail. So they go outside, the lady now directly behind him pointing the gun to.. something, not the father thou. So naturally he doesnt do anything (the same guy that tortured someone else with pure violence for 7 days straight) and does again everything she says. Only after he \n looks into a black hole said \"you have to shoot me if you want me to jump in there\". Well. This was maybe a better idea before she was standing 5 meters apart from you and just shot him in the leg. (neighbors dont care/exist).\n\nSo he jumps into the hole. \nMeanwhile the best detective on this planet, after they have found the kidnapped kidnapper, had the job to tell the nice lady that his child was found. Nope, not via phone. He has to come in person. He knocks, no one answers - the lady currently kills the child. So what does a good detective when he should bring a good answer and no one is answering the door. Yes, obviously he opens the door and searches for the lady - in the end he shot her and she shot him in the head. Yeah, of course \"tis but a scratch\" and he can bring the child safely to the hospital.\n\nSo. The Children are safe. Not because the father. Not because the great detective work. It was just random. The first child could escape via luck and the second child survived because the detective knocked on this evening on the door, which was just a stupid coincidence. \n\nThe story of the second suspect isnt really tellworthy, because this was the laziest red hering I have ever seen. He got arrested and catches the gun of the great detective in the interrogance room. Naturally the detective and the police all have their weapons still and are looking baffled that he kills himself in slowmo. Nope, they dont try to stop him.\n\nSo. This is one of the best movies out there and im here and wondering: WHY IS NO ONE NOTICING ANY OF THIS?\n\nEnjoy the movie.",

He overdoes it, but perhaps that's what filmmaker Denis Villeneuve wanted....? There are also some illogical bits. And the villain, whom we finally discover in the final 30 minutes (after a few red herrings), is pretty ridiculous.

Detective Loki was assigned to their find the children and the culprits behind the abduction. I believe the strongest performance came from Loki who was played by Jake Gyllenhaal. He should have been nominated for his role who has always been able to solve all his cases.

The plot has a lot of great twists and turns, as well as it leaves you with a feeling that everything can happen in this movie. It is, of course, not on a \"Gone Girl\" level, but it is still thrilling enough to make you live through, what the characters live through and the ending is something, that leaves you thinking the most(it actually made me). \nThis movie is very good, awesome even, I would say. I would recommend it if you love Hugh Jackman or Jake Gyllenhaal and if you like thrillers, that have a great structure and a plot, like a puzzle, which the viewer solves the entire film. 8/10, without any doubt a thriller that not many remember, but many should watch",

The movie was recommended as a gripping thriller that gave gut wrenching tension each scene. It could not be more wrong. The movie confuses tension with disturbing scenes, so I wasn't on the edge of my seat I was just grossed out and disturbed. The biggest problem is the runtime. The movie isn't good enough to justify a 154 minute runtime. Also not enough happens in the movie to make me feel like the movie flies by. I can count eight or nine scenes that could've been cut from the movie. There are also some scenes that feel like they don't even belong in the movie, something happens and there is no payoff. I will say that the big reveal at the end is really good and shocking, but the ending also makes you ask questions and with a 2 and a half hour runtime all questions should be answered. I wouldn't recommend it to pass time because it is so long and I wouldn't recommend it to watch for a very intense movie. It deserves a 57%.",

The tension in some scenes especially, in the end, it just amazing and it kept me on the edge of my seat. The script and the dialogue are just amazing in each scene it feels so grounded. The score in some scenes just feels so good and it elevates some moments in scenes and the score feels like the movie. The cinematography is amazing from Roger Deakins and he is my favorite cinematographer working now from 1917 to 2049 Blade Runner. The color correction in the snow and at some houses look amazing. Overall I absolutely love this movie and I would recommend it to anyone.\n\ud83d\udcaf%",

            "content": "Prisoners, Villeneuve's first English-language film, owned me its 154-minute run time and had me hooked from the opening Lord's Prayer. I can't believe it (1) isn't more popular and (2) that it only has an (80) RT critics' score. Gyllenhaal as the live-and-die-by-his-job detective \u2014 he literally doesn't have an interaction that doesn't have to do with the case \u2014 is tortured from falling short lead after lead. We are told that Detective Loki has never let a case go cold. What is cold, however, is the ice-water in his veins, as he didn't even flinch finding a moldering body in a priest's dank basement/secret compartment. I've always said that Joaquin Phoenix is the most underrated actor in Hollywood (a statement I'll need to amend now that he's won an Oscar for Best Actor), but in terms of thrillers, Gyllenhaal is right up there with performances in Zodiac (a film I love but have not watched since starting this blog), and Nightcrawler, where I know he gives a fantastic performance and is on my list. Gyllenhaal's counterpart is Hugh Jackman as Keller Dover, the grieving father of his missing child. While Jackman's accent might slip here and there, his character teeters from sympathetic to terrifying from one scene to the next. I must say, his wood shower torture device was showcased both his will to find his daughter and his craftsmanship as a carpenter. The misdirections are effective at keeping the viewer engaged and, of course, there is a plausible twist that was satisfying. I was afraid maybe the ending was going to ruin the movie, but really loved how they brought a prop from the beginning full-circle.",

            "content": "Prisoners is an enthralling slow burner that pairs impeccable acting with vivid storytelling. In this brooding thriller, Denis Villeneuve explores the ways in which individuals react and respond to trauma. The story revolves around two contrasting individuals and their separate attempts to locate two missing girls. Detective Loki, played by Jake Gyllenhaal, is stoic and enigmatic. His composure is calm and his demeanor is reticent. Keller Dover, played by Hugh Jackman, is a devout and caring father, whose faith is challenged as he battles with decadence to locate the missing girls, one of which is his own. The small details in this film bring it to masterpiece status. The cinematography by Roger Deakins is crisp and bleak. The score by the late J\u00c3\u00b3hann J\u00c3\u00b3hannsson is eerie and haunting. Dense symbolism and motifs are weaved through the film, as Villeneuve reflects on morality, faith, and persistence in the trial of tragedy.",

            "content": "Chilling crime exposed in detail.\n\nDenis Villeneuve's Prisoners (2013) is a shocking depiction of disturbing criminal patterns and creepy adults. Villeneuve uses clever visual clues and stunning cinematography from Roger Deakins to key in the audience to hidden meanings and revealing moments in this crime mystery.\n\nThe detective narrative captured by Jake Gyllenhaal's brilliant understated role is impressive unto itself. Villeneuve imagines an investigation from start to finish with realistic developments and decision making process. In the process, Villeneuve and writer Aaron Guzikowski demonstrate how the police construct a character study of a perpetrator and find missing children. Prisoners shows detectives at their hardest working and the mental toll they undergo to save lives. Prisoners simultaneously reveals flaws in the process of capturing suspects and searching for evidence.\n\nSimilarly, Prisoners debates the moral necessity for torture and the ethics of interrogation with Hugh Jackman's character. As much as Prisoners sympathizes with the victims of kidnapping in the children themselves as well as the parents and siblings in a larger community. Prisoners also strives to prove the value of trusting police work instead of going rogue and conducting private torture and imprisonment. You could argue that Jackman's character's efforts lead to nothing but trouble and only hinder the detective's investigation. Jackman does uncover several key clues, but in the end, he only endangers himself regardless of finding the killer. It's a tough visual to appreciate as Prisoners asks the audience what is right, despite what we would like to think that we would do if put in the same situation.\n\nAll in all, Prisoner's is a masterful thriller that is so suspenseful in the capable hands of director Denis Villeneuve. The two leading actors, Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal, keep you engaged with each scene leading to more suspense.\n\nThe supporting roles from the unsettling Paul Dano, the frightening Melissa Leo, the tragically hurt Maria Bello and Viola Davis, and the upset and uncertain Terrence Howard are all fantastic. Their respective roles all culminate in a moving cast of impressive performances. They each build up the tragedy of Prisoner's dark narrative. \n\nWhile Prisoners can be imposing by its bleak nature, I think it is a captivating film in its own right. Perhaps director Denis Villeneuve's best film even. Prisoners is a stomach churning meld of The Lovely Bones, The Boston Strangler, and Zodiac. Part police procedural, part sociopath character study, part victim viewpoint, and all entertaining, if upsetting. Through all the pain, each person is left a prisoner of their own situation.",

Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a prisoner of his past. Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) is a prisoner of his need to protect his family at all costs. And so on, and so forth.\n\nThe performances in this movie are absolutely outstanding. Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal are the obvious ones, but I thought that Paul Dano and David Dastmalchian did excellent jobs portraying creepy, disturbing characters.\n\nI really liked the cinematography. It's beautiful and dark and claustrophobic. The musical score is also orchestrated incredibly well, with tense atmospheric tracks to amplify the stress when needed.\n\nThe plot of Prisoners is intricate, but not overwrought or convoluted. It's easy enough to follow if you're paying attention, and allows the viewer to make connections on their own. It's fascinating and stressful to watch the characters discover the pieces and fit them together. Everything is important.\n\nMost importantly, this film asks very difficult questions. If you were in the shoes of Keller Dover or Franklin Birch (Terrence Howard), what would you do? Would you follow the path of Keller, or the path of Franklin? Would either choice be right or wrong? Would it destroy your faith, the way that the perpetrator intended?\n\nOverall, Prisoners is a fantastic morally grey movie that forces the viewer to think about what they're being shown.",

The tense moments, the emotional beats, and getting the most out of his actors. Hugh Jackman (Keller Dover) gives one of his more underrated performances ever. We know him as Wolverine, but here, he played the part of a desperate man at the end of his line so well. It shouldn't be overlooked. Jake Gyllenhaal (Detective Loki) was also great, as was Viola Davis (Nancy Birch). She didn't get a lot of screen time, but she made the most of it. Her plea to Paul Dano's (Alex Jones) character is one of the best scenes. Dano is great, as is the short run by Melissa Leo (Holly Jones), who is nearly unrecognizable. Again, it comes back to Villeneuve. He sets the perfect dark tone and the mood of the film is perfect. It takes you on a psychological whirlwind as the mystery unfolds and it's quite the journey.\n\nWeaknesses: There aren't many. As usual, I couldn't really get into Terrence Howard's (Franklin Birch) performance. Something about him in a lot of movies leaves something to be desired and I felt the same way here. The twist involving Leo's character isn't that hard to predict, taking ab it away from the moment itself. Also, the movie is very long and probably could use some trimming of the fat. Cut down to two hours, it would have probably flowed better.\n\nOverall: A gritty mystery film that is masterfully handled. Led by a great director and stunning performances from its leads, especially Jackman and Gyllenhaal, it ranks among the best films of the past five years.",

Overall a great addition in Denis' filmography, 9/10.",

As I begin to experience the film, it's like I'm not even watching them act, because it was so natural...\n.\nI won't spoil the main plot of the movie, just please watch it if you have enough free time...This film is worth your time. See this movie with the right mindset, don't expect some non-stop action in this movie because it will disappoint you. This is the movie where it will soak you with so much drama and how you can relate to it as a human being.\n.\nFor That Ladies and Gentlemen! This Film In My Opinion, Is The Best Movie I've Seen That Is Nearly As Great As \"The Shawshank Redemption\"...Shawshank is like a strand of hair on top of it :D Because \"The Shawshank Redemption\" was the first drama movie that I've seen when I was 14 years old that I really loved...That was rare for me at that time, because I was young and dumb, and that movie experience somewhat matured me when I view films like this...\n.\nAnd of course...You already know what I'm going to rate this film...A PERFECT 10 OUT OF 10!",

Two families see their youngest members abducted on Thanksgiving and Jake Gyllenhaal is the police detective assigned to find the abductor and get them back.  I haven't seen Taken or its sequels, so I'm not sure how this fits into the apparent genre - but parent Hugh Jackman decides to take the investigation into his own hands and his fury means that he isn't subtle.  I don't think we are meant to identify with Jackman, because everything he does seems to alienate the viewer (and threaten his relationships with everyone else, including his wife, Maria Bello, and the other couple, Viola Davis and Terrence Howard).  As the hunt for the abductor continues, the clues pile up, suspects are tracked down, creepiness abounds (and tends to dominate over the sadness and disgust that would otherwise be the main feeling, since we are dealing with child abduction and possible paedophilia here).  You might catch a bit of a Silence of the Lambs vibe, I suppose.  Gyllenhaal is dogged in his pursuit of all leads, although the police action is pretty genre-consistent at best. In the end, things do get tied up with a bow, but I've read that an even darker ending was proposed - that probably would have made for a better film.",

            "content": "SCOTT: (Dr. Scott Allison, Professor of Psychology, University of Richmond) Greg, it looks like Hugh Jackman has temporarily discarded his Wolverine costume just long enough to take on a new role as a desperate father.\n\nGREG: (Greg Smith, Founder of Agile Writers of Richmond, VA) Yes he has and he s pretty convincing in the role.\n\nSCOTT: Prisoners opens with two families sharing a Thanksgiving dinner together. We meet Keller and Grace Dover (Hugh Jackman and Maria Bello) along with their teenage son Ralph (Dylan Minnette) and their six-year-old daughter Anna (Erin Gerasimovich).  And we also meet Franklin and Nancy Birth (Terrence Howard and Viola Davis) and their young daughter Joy (Kyla Drew Simmons).  After their dinner, the families discover that the two young girls are missing. Ralph remembers that the girls had earlier been interested in playing on an RV parked near their home, and soon the police, led by Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) focus their search on the RV and its owners.\n\nGREG: Loki finds the RV and its driver is Alex (Paul Dano) who is a full grown adult but has the mental capacity of a 10-year-old. He is taken into custody but offers no clue as to the whereabouts of the girls. Also, there is no evidence of the girls in the RV. The police let him go. But Keller Dover is not convinced that Alex is ignorant of the girls  location and abducts the man. Together with his friend Franklin he hides the man in an abandoned home and beats him mercilessly trying to get some clue about where to find his daughter.\n\nSCOTT: I ll cut right to the chase. Prisoners is one of the best movies of the year. The film grabbed my attention from the opening minute and held it in earnest for 2 and a half hours. Prisoners is the most compelling movie I ve seen since The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo which came out in 2011. What explains the excellence of Prisoners?  For one thing, it s riveting. We have a powerful storyline combined with the emotional anguish associated with innocent children gone missing. We witness the parallel hero journeys of two strong characters in Keller and Loki, each driven by the same goal of finding the missing girls alive yet they find themselves locking horns repeatedly. There are strong performances from the entire cast and some outstanding direction, too.\n\nGREG: I have to agree. I was leary of a 150-minute running time, but every minute is put to good use. Detective Loki is not just dedicated, but obsessed with finding the girls. He hasn t lost a case yet and he doesn t expect to lose this one.  Despite Gyllenhaal s cool exterior, his Loki is focused and intense. There is also a time limit. Keller keeps reminding Loki that children that aren t found after 7 days are rarely found alive, if they are found at all. And the days tick by with both men approaching the search in their own fashion. Loki is methodical. We get the sense that his every waking moment is focused on solving this case. We are drawn into Loki s world and his intensity is palpable.\n\nSCOTT: Whereas Loki is caught between his incompetent boss and Keller s defiance, Keller is torn between his Christian faith and his desire to do whatever it takes to get Alex to talk.  This makes for a terrific hero story, as Keller s intensity and devotion to his daughter s safety compromise his better judgment.  Or so it seems.  Keller cannot find it in himself to live up to his own strong Christian belief in forgiveness, and yet in an interesting twist, Keller s inability to forgive Alex leads him toward discovering the truth. One of many things I liked about Prisoners is the way it invites us to ponder interesting issues like forgiveness.  Another theme is the idea of  readiness  for life s obstacles. Keller believes he is physically and emotionally ready for any catastrophe, and he even drills this principle to his children, but it s painfully clear that Keller isn t ready at all for what unfolds in this movie. We learn that no one can be ready for every possible setback that life throws at us.\n\nGREG: The title of the movie is misleading. We re attracted to the movie because we think that the story is about two little girls who are prisoners. But in fact, the prisoners in this film are Loki and Keller. They re both bound to their ideals and constrained by their beliefs. Loki believes that if he follows the clues and plays within the rules then he will solve the case. And he is trapped in that belief system. When things don t work the way he thinks they should, he begins to make mistakes. But working outside the box means the system doesn t work - and he needs it to work. Keller believes that protecting his family is his sole responsibility. And it s clear that he s not able to protect his family from every eventuality. If he cannot find his daughter he will have to live with the fact that he has failed. And this is not something he can live with. This forces him to work outside the system and find his daughter by any means necessary.\n\nSCOTT: Well said, Greg. Prisoners is one of the year s best films and contains more memorable scenes than the previous dozen movies combined which we ve reviewed. This film is a great reminder of why I love movies and how a good story can leave its audience thinking and feeling in meaningful ways. I give Prisoners 5 Reels out of 5. The parallel hero stories here were also inspired and moving. Keller and Loki are most certainly not your Hollywood-stereotypical father and cop characters, nor were their journeys predictable. They were two highly memorable characters who travel the hero arc in surprising and powerful ways. There is absolutely no chance at all that their searing experiences could fail to transform them.  I give them 5 Heroes out of 5. Movie:   Hero: \n\nGREG: I agree, this is one of the best films of the year so far. I have to say that I didn t find it as rewarding as you did. I was held captive by the plot and the performances. But I wasn t satisfied that either man impacted the other. At the end of the day they were both vindicated in their own way of thinking. I don t think Detective Loki was much changed at the end of the film compared to the beginning. In fact almost nobody was much different at the end of the film. Keller was tortured by the fact that he couldn t keep his family safe from every evil thing and he became something that was far from heroic. I award Prisoners 4 Reels out of 5 for an entrancing psychological thriller and 4 out of 5 Heroes for compelling characters that kept me watching. To get to a higher rating I would want to see some interaction between Keller and Loki that would catalyze them to change in some more compelling way. Movie:  Hero:",

The father of one of the girls won't stop at nothing to figure out what happened to his daughter. Hugh Jackman was excellent as the father trying to figure out where his daughter and her friend are. His performance was so believable. Jake Gyllenhaal did excellent as a detective trying to help the family and figure out the mystery. The rest of the cast were believable, including Viola Davis, Paul Dano, Dylan Minnette, and Terrence Howard. The cinematography was great. Denis Villeneuve is a visionary director who knows how to tell a story. The film was very emotionally tense. It's an Emotional Roller Coaster of a film. This is one of those films that makes you imagine what you would do in the situation, how far you would go to find your child. This film is a spectacular masterpiece. I would super recommend this film to everyone.\n\n\nRating: 9.9/10",

What hooks you though is a whole combination of incredible performances (particularly from Hugh Jackman), great character-building and typically cold, sparse and nail-biting direction from Denis Villenueve, and amazingly moody cinematography from Roger Deakins.\nWHAT I DIDN'T LIKE: As it unravels, you realise the plot and themes are actually rather convoluted and silly, and the fact you get so much breathing room to think about all that makes it quite a big problem.\nVERDICT: A dark, scary thriller where the brilliant cast and direction can't quite overcome the weaker foundations.",

In a grueling and long, seemingly endless mystery, we'll experience the pain of losing a child and just how far one will go to put things back to normal.\n\n\"Prisoners\" is an emotional and tragic story about a pair of families who lose their young daughters. Not only is this just hard to watch at times, but it's also really painful. This film is emotional and it just drains you. You're watching this family experience this loss and there's really no words to describe it. I don't think anyone would know what to do when it comes to losing their child and I can't imagine experiencing that. Seeing it play out is enough for me.\n\nThis film is a really good, intriguing mystery film. It's a mix between like a crime and a drama film because you're going along this journey with the detective to figure out who committed the crime, but you're also following the family's story. This movie keeps you guessing and wondering and it never really has a clear cut answer. It's very dark and the entire mystery somehow constantly added more and more layers to the story. It was a very fun (I use that term loosely) story to try and analyze and solve.\n\nHugh Jackman has an amazing and gut wrenching performance here. You see just how far a Father will go to find his daughter and the surplus amount of pain that comes with that. He does things and experiences things that most other men won't, all because this is such a painful tragedy. Jake Gyllenhaal, who's still my favorite actor today, also gives a great performance. He plays the serious and firm detective with a twitch, and he also does a great job as one of the primary leads. Paul Dano also gives one of his eeriest performances to date, playing a low IQ, potential suspect boy. All the performances were fantastic in this film and they really brought out that emotional gravity of the situation.\n\nThe screenplay overall was amazing. I loved the dialogue and the chain of events. This is a long, drawn out film that might not necessarily be for everyone, but it's still a fantastically structured script.\n\nIn the end, \"Prisoners\" is one of the best films of 2013, being one of the darkest and most real dramas out there.",

The cinematography is amazing and perfectly captures the reality and lack of hope surrounding the kidnapping. All of these reasons lead up to a surprisingly amazing film, leading me to give this a 9/10.",

            "content": "Prisoners is a story about two little girls gone missing and the drama and story behind it. Hugh Jackman, Terrance Howard, and Jake Gyllenhaal are in this as well as Voila Davis and other talented actors and actresses. First off let's talk about Jackman, the main character. OH MY GOD HES FUCKING AMAZING, seriously, I love x-men, but this might be his best performance and movie I've ever seen. Terrance Howard and Viola Davis, the other couple in the film with the missing daughter are both great here too. I was really blown away by Jake Gyllenhaal, playing the head detective to solve this case about the girls. Paul Dano plays the role he plays in almost every film, but with a little something extra, which made his character even more compelling. I could talk for hours about the acting, but all I can say now is that every character was extremely compelling and never bored me when I was watching. The camerawork and lighting are all impeccable as well, long drawn out shots are featured quite often, and it was a really good looking film. The plot and script are both excellent, fueled by perfect direction and an enormous effort by the actors, it is fully realized as the dark and unsettling narrative it is meant to be. The movie pulled my in from very early on, and refused to let me go with a tightly written plot and the insane turns made not only by the plot but also the characters in the movie. Each moment felt like time was evaporating from the characters hands and as they desperately did anything they could to find answers, I found out that maybe the good guys weren't all that different from the bad guys. Fully realized characters through magnificent acting (espically by Jackman) made me feel and understand each decision they made, no matter how unsettling it was. This is a hard movie to watch, such like 12 Years a Slave, you don't really agree with what's happening, but the film is so damn good you can't look away from it. In the end, Prisoners is in my opinion one of the best films ever made, it is extremely under viewed but those who have seen it have witnessed a masterpiece in film and hopefully appreciated if at least half as much as I do",

In a chilling opening sequence they disappear after a Thanksgiving dinner from their utterly normal suburban street.\n\nUltimately, the film is about what's legitimate in a civilised society. Hugh Jackman is fantastic as Keller Dover, the father of one of the girls, who very quickly takes the law into his own hands, and will stop at seemingly nothing, acting purely on hunches and his own prejudices. \n\nMy concern about the film's own prejudices is that he's portrayed mostly as the protagonist, the character with all the agency, whereas Terrence Howard  (his friend and father of the other missing girl) is conflicted, struck with deference to the law and the authorities, rendered helpless by liberal angst and weak where Keller is strong and decisive. The film also renders their wives mostly useless. Hmmm...\n\nBetween them and the horror of their missing children is Jake Gyllenhaal, excellent in one of his 'quiet' performances. \n\nIt's true that there's little triumphalism on display in the finale, there's no great redemption or satisfaction to be had from Keller's vigilante approach.\n\nThis is a film of no little skill - the cinematography and direction is terrific, and it's shot through with unease. But it does seem to be taking itself VERY seriously, and this grim intensity is pretty wearing by the end.",

Dangers that lurk out there, we are scared of, dangers we have to protect ourselves from, dangers that we stay from clear away. What dangers these parts may bring, it's darker and hidden, but we are prepared to handle when it comes to handle when we have to become it. We are in prison ed in what we lost, what we have to live with, what changes us, what we don't know, what justice is left in this world, what we can't get back anymore. When what was taught to us to be prepared, we weren't. When what little civility we enjoyed, we no longer have anymore, a painful reminder of what was taken from us that is contained all within ourselves. We might bring those whom share in this tragedy equally, but they are not like us (high). We might bring the institutions to help, but they can do so little, when your invested in this tragedy more than they are and don't follow the rule of law to solve a mystery but our gut instinct as a patriarch of the household. When this sort of this is unearthed as common, in a small town when this sort of thing uncommonly thing doesn't happen. We are imprisoned even more with new knowledge of this happening, and we weren't even prepared. Stuck and contained in this misery, unable to get out, escape, waiting, praying, surrounded by other prisoners around us that suffer the same misery. We live to console eachother, and turn on eachother, then turn ourselves. While we say we could do better, we have to try, we have to do something, anything, we say that it isn't enough, we have to continue trying. There is so much other can do, as they have to continue on with their life, while others have to carry on with other things, responsibilities. When we say to ourselves what to do now, whether to give up, grieve, wait longer, blame each other, ourselves. When all we want is it back. We can go easy, hard on everyone and ourselves. What unearth's in us is this wild beast that we don't know existed.existed . We release what previously impridon, and imprison our civility and sanity. When we live this double life, hidden from the world, we hate it that only we know. When we have other responsibilities that we neglect to be imprisoned, what our mind is no longer reliable when it plays tricks on us or can't understand the entire truth, or when somethings play tricks on us, we don't know. We cling on to an ounce of hope. When we have breaks, tough breaks, leads, some knowledge, no knowledge, it all rattles our brain to what moral compass and direction to take. We have restraint that we always carry that tells us to wait, don't do anything irrational, think twice, trust in others, but time runs out. What goes on our minds that breaks us, when all we care is what goes on in those effected mind. What goes in those whom are sick's mind. When we cling to hope, but we reveal how dark this world is, we are haunted in our dreams and reality of this tragedy, we can't sleep. We contemplate whether we are ready for hard hitting news, when we have to handle things very delicately. When we are no different then those whom are sick in how hard we hit, that let the beasts attack one another in this civil world. Our rage over powers our logic at times. When we can no longer stop hitting or hating ourselves we no longer know how to live and go on. When we can just medicate ourselves enough to escape and not deal with it all. When we can just disappear, vanish from reality and existence with a simple drug.\n***************************************************************************\nWhen we don't see somethings coming when we don't need to think our life is headed in such directions that we enjoy the company of our friends and family thst we don't need to feel like prisoners. When we see within a sudden moment our life turns a different direction and we are imprisoned in a moment we can't get out from. When we don't see why our mind goes different directions not knowing, we accept our new state of mind imprisoned in our own emotional & mental breakdown. When we see that we would search everywhere in every direction to free those from their prisons we wish were there to release them from. When we see trying to escape some directions we head to other directions when its the most sure thing to break out of prisons. When we see that being around certain institutions and systems any case can turn any direction whether we rely on the prison system or our own. When we see that following every lead can lead us to any direction when every clue brings us closer to breaking out of our prisons. When we do see that others deserve to head the direction towards prison when they themselves understand what threats they are if they are when let loose. When we see how such directions can lead to nowhere and living in such prisons for an eternity we can live with it. When we see some solutions that direct us away from the light is to go deeper in the dark and create our own prisons and prisoners so they know how we feel. When we see such prisons are too unbearable to take that we take a different direction on ourselves. When others see some directions have worked in the past that they get what they want by simply ubducting and imprisoning things that they couldn't get another way we don't see what others are like that can imprison more then they keep. When we see how our actions can lead to other actions that changes the direction of how life goes that can either liberate us from captivity or keep us there forever. When we dont see what we store within us while we enjoy much happiness that we experience that we dont see we also store misery when life changes our direction and the vary thing we imprison is released and the vary thing we release we imprison we dont know what we are capable of doing. When we don't see the countless lives that have been imprisoned but others reckless actions and what directions they took or what we took to say whether it was right or wrong when there is no direction as to how to handle such life changing events but to sit, wait and live with it. When we still need to see everything to its clarity to focus our attention and direct it towards any others who remain prisoners that we free them from such captivity before it's too late.",

It's a masterpiece of the crime genre that covers a lot of ground, but every crumb, clue, and detail dropped by director Denis Villeneuve and screenwriter Aaron Guzikowski is essential to its (murky-ish) resolution. Comparisons to films like Se7en and Zodiac are inevitable because of the films' shared genre and dark look/tone. Prisoners, however, is a different beast entirely. Not only is it a step up in terms of quality (yep), but it packs an emotional punch throughout that's tough to sit with and damn near impossible to shake. It's the perfect way to kick off the fall movie season and a definite contender for my best film of 2013.\n\nIt's Thanksgiving in rural Pennsylvania, and Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) and his family are spending the holiday with their close friends and neighbors, the Birches. When the youngest of both clans, Anna Dover (Erin Gerasimovich) and Joy Birch (Kyla Drew Simmons) run off to play, there's nothing on their parents' mind other than leftovers, but when they don't turn up and can't be found anywhere, everyone understandably panics.\n\nThe police, led by Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal), pick up the primary suspect rather quickly. The girls were seen playing near an RV that's owned by Alex Jones (Paul Dano), and when Loki moves in on him, he tries to get away. Unfortunately, they can't charge him with anything after a forensic sweep of the RV turns up nothing, but that's not good enough for Keller. He grabs Alex outside of the home where he lives with his Aunt Holly (Melissa Leo), and with the help of Joy's father, Franklin (Terrence Howard), he chains Alex up at a run-down property he owns and starts torturing him for information. If the police won't do anything, he's prepared to take matters into his own hands.\n\nThat's just Prisoners' first 30 minutes or so. It ultimately follows a remarkable number of threads-each one darker than the last-before the whole tale is told. Villeneuve, making his English-language debut following the searing drama Incendies, teases each thread in such a way that you know it will be integral to the story as a whole. You know this because you've seen this movie before. It's a crime film that's built knowing decades of genre conventions exist and will be necessarily followed if we're to travel from point A to point B successfully. But Prisoners overcomes the trappings of feeling overly familiar by paying attention to detail and keeping every ball in the air-something studio thrillers just can't pull off (or don't care to try pulling off) today.\n\nPrisoners' supremely rich character work is another essential aspect to its success. The detective character is a critical piece in this genre's puzzle, but Loki is a very special iteration of someone who's typically one-note and uninteresting. In the hands of a never-better Jake Gyllenhaal, the detective takes on a fascinating hybrid of vulnerability and hard-nosed cleverness. He figures stuff out, but he's often behind the 8-ball (sometimes tragically so). And on occasion, the trail's-gone-cold nature of the case manifests itself outwardly through Loki in dangerous ways. It's a brilliant performance.\n\nThe whole ensemble is terrific, really, with Hugh Jackman doing career-best work as an already intense father upping the intensity to a 15 out of 10 following the disappearance of his daughter. Paul Dano doesn't say much, but his creepy and pathetic (yet bizarrely sympathetic) portrayal of Alex fits the film perfectly. Melissa Leo is so out-there playing Alex's aunt, but like Dano, she's absolutely magnetic. Viola Davis, Terrence Howard, Maria Bello and others complete the deep principal cast, and all excel in smaller roles.\n\nThe film is a spectacular editing showcase, and Roger Deakins' dark, small-town-influenced cinematography is among the year's best. And Villeneuve and Guzikowski-not content to simply satisfy their audience on a visceral level-touch on religion and rural American values in interesting and non-judgemental ways. Simply put, Prisoners is a one-of-a-kind movie-something that's as thought-provoking as it is emotionally involving, as well-acted as it is well-crafted, and as good as anything else this year.\n\nhttp://www.johnlikesmovies.com/prisoners-review/",

I absolutely loved this movie. Villeneuve's story telling mixed with a blend of intense suspense, drama, and emotion, perfectly accommodates a beautiful mystery thriller. Hugh Jackman in the film plays one of the main dads whose girl has gone missing. This is by far the best we've seen of him in awhile because his performance is top notch. Jackman gives an excellent portrayal of a father going insane and that will do literally anything to get his daughter back. Gyllenhaal just gets better as he keeps making movies. There is no role this guy can not do and it is a true pleasure watching this man act. After viewing Prisoners, the film will definitely leave an emotional scar on you. Villeneuve is afraid to expose his dark side. He takes this movie as far as it gets on the creepy aspect and will send you chills throughout the whole the movie. The film is two and a half hours long but don't let the run time scare you. Prisoners' mysterious plot will have your eyes and ears glued to the screen listening to every tiny little detail because being extremely attentive while watching this movie is very important.    I also enjoyed the setting of the film and the way it looked on screen. The cold environment added to the chilling aspect even more. Prisoners will haunt you with its eerie story but will leave you utterly impressed with its heart racing storyline.",

That's the scenario in the crime drama/thriller \"Prisoners\" (R, 2:33).\n\nWhen the young daughters of two neighbors go out to play after their families share Thanksgiving dinner together and then no one can find the girls, the panic is immediate and gut-wrenching.  The helplessness of these two sets of parents (Hugh Jackman and Maria Bello as Keller and Grace Dover and Terrence Howard and Viola Davis as Franklin and Nancy Birch) is compounded when the police release a person of interest named Alex Jones (played brilliantly by Paul Dano) for lack of evidence.  Despite the fact that Alex has the mental capacity of a 10-year-old, Keller is convinced that Alex knows something. He takes matters into his own hands and goes much farther than even the most devoted of parents could imagine.  Keller is willing to do anything, and I mean ANYTHING, to extract the information he needs to find these two little girls. Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) is doing what he can to solve the case, and even seems willing to go a little outside the law to do it, but keeps coming up empty.\n\nThe tension gradually but steadily builds as these parents know that time is running out for their missing children. Clues in the case are scant and hints as to where this story is going are there on the screen, but seem too trivial to matter - until they do. The plot twists and ultimate reveals are shocking, but the film's real power is in the questions it forces us to ask - and keep asking after the film is over. The script is smart enough to provide us sufficient closure to justify the emotional investment we've made in this story, but still leaves it open-ended enough to give us something to think about after the credits roll. The unusually long run time may make you feel like a prisoner, but the complex, well-directed and very well-acted story (mostly) justifies the film's length. \"B+\"",

The plot is filled with puzzles and creeps under your skin as it's highly realistic and tensional. Gonna throw myself over Villeneuve's catalogue.",

The acting and script are fantastic, in particular Hugh does a great job all the time as the stressed, no sleep, good guy doing terrible things in order to save his daughters life.  Everything is bleak, and when they discover something to seems to look up, only to be crushed again.  It's a great story from beginning to end, always has our attention, but the second half really takes off by being intense not because of shootouts or fighting but with how well what is going on is portrayed, plus how realistic and terrible the things that are going on are.  From being shot, to suicid, to the discovery of cloths, and the torture of those who can't physically save themselves.  It's a roller-coaster watch and amazingly well done, there's simply nothing that was done wrong.  Would 10/10 recommend, probably over Gone Baby Gone but would have to watch it again to know for sure.",

Prisoners is about two family friends having a get together when their girls both go missing. This film is so realistically scary and very real. It truly captures how people would act when put under pressure. Everyone in this movie is amazing. Not a single performance that I thought could've been better. The movie has a very dark and creepy vibe throughout the whole movie and keeps you guessing throughout. The twist is very satisfying and it makes sense. This movie has a great cast and a great script. Prisoners is probably the best movie of 2013. I had only one problem with the movie. The ending. At first, when the ending came, it felt rushed and abrupt, it didn't make sense. After the movie was done, it had me thinking a while. After a while of thinking, it clicked. The ending isn't a big problem but it felt like the movie just ended. You have to think for a while to really find the true meaning of the ending. Other than that, this is a PERFECT film that I highly encourage you to check this one out in theaters. \n\nPrisoners: 5/5 stars",

But just how far will this desperate father go to protect his family?\n\nI thought this film was great even though it was slow at times. I enjoyed the acting, It also was a real emotional movie, It was not predictable, and it was not a confusing movie and it was very original \n\nMy favorite scene of the movie was when Loki shoved his stuff off his desk. I liked this scene bc it changed the mood of the film and it showed that Loki was becoming unhinged. \n\nThe actor who gave the best performance to me was Hugh Jackman. He owned every scene he was in he portrayed the characters emotions so well. What he did different was the good guy became a bad guy by the end of the film. My favorite character though was Loki. He brang some much needed comic relief to a very depressing movie. \n\nI would give this film a 8.7 rating. There was great acting. I thought the movie was too long to tell the story effectively. I thought they could have ended the movie better. My ending would be Mr. Dover reuniting with his daughter and family. \n\nOverall i would recommend this movie to any Jake Gyllenhaal fan and any crime fans. Good overall movie.",

Heading the investigation, Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) arrests its driver, Alex Jones (Paul Dano), but a lack of evidence forces his release. As the police pursue multiple leads and pressure mounts, knowing his child's life is at stake the frantic Dover decides he has no choice but to take matters into his own hands. But just how far will this desperate father go to protect his family?... \n\nThe topic of \"Prisoners\" is without no doubt one of the more difficult things a human being can go through. A missing child and when minutes turns into hours into days every second is valuable. There\u00b4s an emotional complexity in the film and the sense of dread/something terrifying lurking in the darkness is so apparent you can touch it. Denis Villenueve has managed to put together this strong movie without losing the focus of the topic and getting the absolutely best out of every actor/actress in the film. Hugh Jackman is magnificent (one of his best performances showing all the emotional states you can imagine), Paul Dano is great as the pacified Alex and the same goes for Jake Gyllenhaal, Terence Howard, Maria Bello and Melissa Leo. I love the layers in the film and Villenueve keeps you in his grip until the end part in which you start to grasp the connecting dots before the conclusion. The weight in the movie lays on the male counterparts and all the females are less prominently in the film. This gives maybe a less balanced script, but it\u00b4s not stealing the focus of the film. \"Prisoners\" is truly engaging throughout the running time despite not maybe adding a revolutionary point of view on a classic theme.",

I can usually pick up clues to how it will end and put together the maze right away but it didn't just end there...\"hope for the best, prepare for the worst\".  Like some other reviews I read it maintains enough plausibility to be believable that it could really happen or has happened and after it was over I just stared at the screen processing what I saw. Anyone who is a parent will find this especially difficult to watch because you keep thinking about what you would do- and how far you would go.  Would I become capable of things that happened in the chain of events if I thought I would get my girl back?  What if I never could get her back- would I recover?  Fantastic acting by Jackman- he had the stand out performance with of course Gyllenhaal at close second.

            "content": "As any parent, imagine your worst nightmare, imagine your child had been kidnapped from you in broad day light, with very little idea of who done it and a growing fear of as time goes by what you may find. Prisoners takes this idea and turns it into something totally raw, powerful and at some points extremely intense to watch. On thanksgiving day the Keller and Birch family unite to celebrate the festivities, in a small little town, in a small little street. With all the excitement going on, both families daughters, who are no older than 8, ask if its okay to head back to the Dover household, a 2 minute walk, to pick up a toy. After some ground rules are made off the children go and that is where it all goes horribly wrong. With nothing more to go on, than a dodgy looking RV parked on the street, the families turn frantic and soon enlist the help of Detective Loki, a left field cop, who has aced every assignment given to him. Soon suspects begin to come out the woodwork, leaving both families to do what they think is right for the good of their children. Looking at this cast, its hard to imagine the package you may receive here, not that they are bad, but there are some huge names in here, leaving you wondering how far the film will take it. All i'll say is do not worry, every single actor, minus a few stereotypically written lines or situations knock the entire piece into the stratosphere. Hugh Jackman, Maria Bello, Terrence Howard and Viola Davis are all on top form as the parents, the dynamic between them all is phenominal, ranging from Maria Bello's completely torn apart and useless wife to Hugh Jackman's fiery anger. Everyone here is really on fire. Loki is played outstandingly by Jake Gyllenhall, his mix of intensity and profesionalism, with added mannerisms, are a joy to watch. His performance is best served when dealing with Hugh Jackman or his captain, who wont stop riding his ass. Paul Dano and Melissa Leo put in a thunderous, performance as the main suspect and his aunt. Both of them go to such lengths to look and sound so different from their usual, your actually pleasantly surprised by the time you work out, who it is your actually watching add to this mix of powerhouse performances. Add to this some extremely creepy cinematography, harking back to John Carpenters Halloween, with slow tracking wide shots, that make everything seem voyouristic or long one takes, in particular a torture scene which literally looks like it was nailed in 1 take and your onto a winner. The entire town feels dank and winteresque, giving you this feeling of dread and hopelessness. The lighting is creepy and emotional and the grade on this thing is dulled down, to make it look less big budget and more real life. So whats wrong with the film? Well a couple of things, first off there are some pacing and editing issues. The film is over 2 and a half hours long, which is fine, but at points you literally feel like your backtracking in order to show how torturous this all is, half an hour could have easily been shaved off this and it would have been all the better for it. Also the film likes to fade to black just before major points of relieve happen, yet again, i get why this is done, at some points it works astoundingly well. But at points in treads on giving you no relieve what so ever, that you really aren't sure what the bigger picture is trying to be. Also the film spends a stupid amount of time of a drawing of a puzzle, only for it to turn into something so stupid and throwaway, had they actually done something intelligent with this, id have gladly sat an extra half hour i just wanted shaved off watching them add another thick layer onto the piece. finally the ending, I will not spoil it but its so off kilter that your left kind of buzzing about like a dying bee in the wind. Very little exposition is given to the final 15 minutes and because of this, you just feel like it was a ploy to turn one final twist on the audience. Other than that, this film is a thrilling and emotional, pitch black piece. I highly reccomend it.",

Prisoners is a film that pushes the boundaries of moralistic values, it crosses a line that we hope to never have to cross in a situation we pray we never have to be in.\nKeller Dover played by Hugh Jackman (Wolverine, Les Mis\u00e9rables) and his wife Grace played by Maria Bello(Payback, The Secret Window) attend a Thanksgiving dinner at the home of their neighbours Franklin played by Terrence Howard (Iron Man, Hustle & Flow) and Nancy Birch played by Viola Davis (How to get away with murder, The Help). Their 2 young daughters, Anna and Joy go outside to play but never return. An investigation is launched with Detective Loki played by Jake Gyllenhaal (Nightcrawler, Brokeback Mountain)arresting the prime suspect being a young man with the IQ of a ten year old whose RV was spotted where the young girls were last seen. As time drags on and the girls remain missing slowly desperation sets in and Keller decides to take matters into his own hands.... Once again I want to say so much about the plot but if I do I'd be breaking my own rules and giving away so much.\nThe plot is so interesting, I loved it, I loved the way the story in its entirety was played out, and I loved the characters and how well they were played. Hugh Jackman proves once again why he is so sought after in the film industry he was so convincing as the desperate father I'm surprised there was no Oscar buzz about his performance. Not only Hugh though, his fellow cast members were just as engaging and hypnotic. A perfect cast in my opinion. Jake Gyllenhaal (who did win Best Supporting Actor of the Year Award at the 2013 Hollywood Film Festival) was mesmerising with his character as well. The other stand out feature for me though was the cinematography it was amazing and really feel it helped the story teller tell his amazing tale; once again I was extremely impressed by the visuals. I don't really know the director Denis Villeneuve's other works but I can tell he is a man of talent and I'll be looking him up to see what else he has done.\nPrisoners will leave you feeling desperate and curious, running at a little under 3hrs it does take its toll as well, I'm not sure it really needed to be that long but for the outcome it does work and you hardly notice the time. The film is very disturbing in nature, has some very graphic scenes so not one for the kids. Be prepared for a magical ride with this one it'll have you'll be running a full gauntlet of emotions and I'm so glad to say the twists and turns the film takes throughout only make it so much better.",

There is a constant abandonment of certainty in the sense that the perpetrator of the kidnapping is completely elusive. Furthermore, Keller Dover pinpoints the alleged kidnapper and insists that the police take him into custody until the police obtain information from him. When the police let the alleged kidnapper go, Alex loses his cool and takes matters into his own hands. From this point on, we see how quickly the tables can turn and how the kidnapping of a child can fuel desperate and violent actions to the alleged kidnapper who becomes a prisoner at the hands of Keller Dover.\n\nKeller Dover and Detective Loki's actions fuel much of the movie. Keller Dover is determined to find out the truth behind the kidnapping for himself, while Detective Loki follows a more rational and strategic approach to identifying the potential kidnapper. Detective Loki has his fair share of looking out for potential suspects and eventually finds Bob Taylor who is acting suspiciously at a candlelight vigil, and who runs away when seen. Although Bob Taylor is not critical to the plot, there could have been a better explanation of his story and the significance of the snakes and mazes to him than what we are given. Much of what is revealed about his life is determined posthumously, and we are left without the immediate and possibly intense story of the character to provide us with more background about what could be happening with the two little girls.\n\nKeller Dover continues to torture Alex Jones, not realizing that he has the wrong victim and is torturing Alex without reason. There are many clues that are pieced together to reveal the actual kidnapper and when these come together, the story becomes more interesting.\n\nStill, there is some information missing from the plot that I am curious about, and the movie did not succeed in filling in these gaps. What is the significance of the mazes? Do the mazes refer to a physical or psychological concept? There are a number of other plot gaps that could be better explained by the movie.",

This film is so good that it approaches the heights of similar crime masterpieces as Silence of the Lambs and Zodiac (one of my 10 favorite films).  It only falls short because its length is a bit too long.  Now, typically I'm last person to complain about a film's length because my mindset has always been that there's no such thing as \"too much of a good thing\" when it comes to movies.  Zodiac, for instance, happens to be a longer film than Prisoners by about 9 minutes, assuming you're watching the Director's Cut (it's only 5 minutes longer than the theatrical version and I've never watched that).  However, the difference between the films is that Zodiac keeps the facts, plot, and intrigue going at full force throughout the entire length of the picture, while Prisoners has a few moments that are arguably inconsequential to the story.  That isn't to say it has bad moments, because it does not, but given the film's pacing and slow-developing plot threads it could have benefitted from tighter editing, whereas the lengthier Zodiac uses all of its time very wisely.  However, this is a very minor issue and hardly any kind of deterrent.  If you haven't seen Prisoners, it is very well worth the time.  It is thoughtful, disturbing, chilling, and has many outstanding performances by every actor/actress.",

And Hugh Jackman comes strong  with his most emotional character who fights his inner demons before losing his ways. and this may be his most emotional performance so far. The rest of the cast does a very good job being secondary characters, and well devloped. Paul Dano is outstanding here as always  and as his career slowly takes to a better place.\n\nThe movie is smart and very entertaining.

The subject is just so disturbing, all the more because its so real; I mean, its the stuff you hear about in the news and its sad, but as a parent, its the stuff of nightmares. On one hand, I can understand where Mr. Dover (Jackman) is coming from; I mean, given the same circumstances, I can't say I wouldn't do the same thing. Anyhow, the subject matter was disturbing and the actors were incredible; Jackman, of course was awesome. Jake Gyllenhaal was creepier than the accused abductor, I kept expecting a plot twist that he's the guilty party for some reason. Paul Dano  is such an underrated actor but he was spectacular in this film and Melissa Leo was absolutely brilliant!

So he takes matters into his own hands. Right away we Biblically know this is wrong. The Bible clearly states vengeance is not ours. Keller abandons faith when tribulations occur in his life. He turns to everything, but God. We are called to rely on God in hard times. The film shows the fallen and sinful nature of man, and how desperate and depraved we become without God. In the film, a character states that killing children is how we wage war against God, it turns people into demons.\n\n\"Prisoners\" is a bold film that stands on it's own two feet.

There are some wonderful moments and episodes but ultimately the punches are pulled. The children, naturally, look like the only only thing they've gone missing from is a Gap ad, Hugh Jackman only looks comfortable when he's allowed to pound his fists and the maze conundrum is never satisfactorily explored.

            "content": "Movie Review: Prisoners\n\nLast year in late September a buddy and I decided to see a new movie. I had my heart set on the Insidious two, which was supposed to scare the life out of you. My buddy had other ideas. He decided to drag me along to Prisoners. At the time I hadn't heard of the movie and when he described it to me I nearly backed out on him, but being the good friend that I am I went any way. \t\t\t\nAs we took our seats I was positive I just blew another 10 bucks on a movie that probably wasn't worth three dollars. But when the theatre doors opened 153 minutes later I came out a new man. It was brilliant to say the least. A beautifully constructed film with grade A actors and spectacular scenery. Jake Gyllenhaal and Hugh Jackman battle each other as Keller Dover (Jackman) searches for his suddenly kidnapped daughter, Anna.\nThe audience quickly gets the creepy vibe of this movie in an early scene as the camera pans across a beaten, rusty, old RV sending chills down your spine. Keller Dover is certain that the kidnapper has something to do with this RV, but Detective Loki (Gyllenhaal) thinks otherwise. As the movie continues more disturbing and frightening scenes occur. When Keller finds the man from the RV he decides to take it into his own hands without the knowledge of the police. Beating and torturing the young man found in this RV parked outside his house. \nThe star studded line up made up of Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Terrence Howard, and Viola Davis gave everything they had for this film. Jackman overpowered the man in the RV with his large and powerful physical stature while Gyllenhaal played a brilliant detective. Now, Gyllenhaal was not nominated for any awards from this movie, but he should have. He played a sly detective with a slight tick and he absolutely nailed it. From beginning to end Gyllenhaal had me entertained with his quick compressed blinks and the toothpick he had in the side of his lip to help keep his tick under control. He had a calm laidback demeanor with a slight temper at times making it the perfect combination for a detective. \nThe films setting in a cold Pennsylvania town is exactly the location this film needs. A Pennsylvania November is filled with cold dark nights and foggy days giving it the ideal setting for the movie. The audience can feel the creepiness of the film just by the location it takes place in.\nAlthough this film has a scary feeling to it, I'd still encourage it to most audiences over the age of 13, whether or not you like scary movies. Throughout the movie you feel as if you can determine what will happen next, and you would be completely wrong. By far one of the best movies of 2013 and I'd encourage anyone of any type of audience to see this film. It is the perfect combination of actors who fill their role perfectly, and a setting that is spot on. If you see one movie from the year 2013 it must be Prisoners. You won't regret it.",

In spite of the big names on the cast, Villeneuve maintains all the aspects that conform the integrity of his directing. Shots that show the tension of the situation, and clear details that impact you immediately. \n\nThe story is slowly paced, and has many twists along side it, some working better than others, but what really prevents the running time from being a bothering aspect, is the greatly constructed characters and the respecting solid acting's from the cast. Jackman's troubled and agressive father demands your attention, but it's Gyllenhaal's meditative cop who really stands out for me. \n\nThe grimy and bleak tone of the story is portrayed with expertise by the masterful hand of cinematographer Roger Deakins, and this really adds to the constant atmosphere of suspense. For this reason, and Villeneuve's style of direction, one might draw comparations with David Fincher's style, something that isn't actually bad per se.\n\nThe main problem with the film is its heavy-handed religious symbolism, which never really adds anything to the actual story line, and is deeply under-used. Aside from that, there are some points in the story that seem somewhat out of place, but still, these don't really ruin the viewing experience.\n\nOverall, Prisoners is a greatly crafted Thriller, with outstanding acting's, award-worthy photography and an interesting story that keeps you hooked for its somewhat overlong running time.",

            "content": "I'm having a lot of trouble thinking of a better film to come out in 2013. 'Prisoners' has almost everything going for it: an A list cast and director, a great story, top notch script and boat loads of tension. It fits together as intricately as the maze in its logo, and keeps the viewer on the edge of their seat until the last frame.\n\nThis film is successful for all the reasons listed above, but the story itself is the major strength. It is a slow burn style thriller that ramps up the tension in an incredibly palpable way. Starting out as a fairly straightforward abduction story, it quickly escalates into a full fledged frenzy. Twist after turn keeps the audience genuinely unsure of what is going to happen next and where it is heading. This is the ultimate job of a thriller, and this one stays one step ahead at all times. Despite this escalation, it never looses sight of what it wants to accomplish, keeping its focus on its characters and their inner struggles in a very intimate way. The ending is just right, leaving you exactly when it is supposed to.\n\nIts characters are brought to life by some really good performances up and down the cast. Both Jackman and Gyllenhaal turn in performances worthy of being called their career bests. Gyllenhaal in particular throws himself into a very different role than he has played before, and his method acting and body language really sell it. I would cite Jackman for overacting in a few scenes, but he is very good as the father who comes to the uneasy but unapologetic realization that he will do unthinkable things to save his family. It is a very interesting dichotomy to watch someone pushed to that limit, and it leaves you with no real judgment on the morality of his character. The rest of the cast is rounded out by some great supporting performances from solid vets like Leo, Dano, Bello and Howard.\n\nThe direction is another extremely strong suit here. If you told me this was directed by David Fincher, I just might believe you. Aside from a very Fincheresque story, the direction is very much his style. Striking high contrast and lack of color saturation almost mimicking black and white photography combine with a masterful use of shot composition and symmetry that really echos Finchers directorial eye. Villeneuve is a director to watch. He's been around awhile, and while isn't particularly prolific I will be keeping an eye out for his future projects. \n\nThere are a few minor issues I had with the film. First and foremost is its length. I'm all for a director using as much time as necessary to tell their story exactly the way they want, but I ended up feeling 153 minutes was a little much. I feel a good 15 minutes could have seen the cutting room floor without sacrificing much if anything. Another qualm I had is that after all the pain the villain ends up inflicting, I wanted to see them suffer a bit rather than the quick, arbitrary ending they are given. Is that wrong? Maybe, but I can't say I have any shame in wanting to see such a detestable character get exactly what's coming to them. A few minor issues with pacing slow things down a bit in the middle act as well. These negatives said, they are all very minor complaints that really don't do much to detract from such a great final product.\n\nConsidering the overall artistic vision, depth and effectiveness of this film on all fronts, I have to say I am fairly shocked of its lack of critical recognition and fanfare. In my opinion, this was surely deserving of several Oscar nominations and probably wins. Yet, it remains unheralded and relatively unknown to the general public for some reason. But don't let the lack of popular praise fool you: this is a grade A thriller from top to bottom, and I'd place it right at the top of best pictures of the year.",

Veteran Coen Brothers cinematographer Roger Deakins lends his expertise to newcomer writer Aaron Guzikowski and Director Denis Villeneuve. You can certainly see the influence of Deakins throughout the film and his beautiful take on reality in a chaotic situation.\n\nThis is one of those films that you don't want to know a thing about before you go. You don't even want to hear people brushstroke over it because even that is something you don't want to hear. For that matter, I won't even go close to going there. I will give you a brief introduction to what you should expect. Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) and his wife Grace (Maria Bello), walk down the street to their neighbors, Franklin Birch (Terrence Howard) and Nancy (Viola Davis). They each have a daughter and along the course of the evening, those two daughters disappear without a trace.\n\n\"Prisoners\" is a gut-wrenching and fast running two and a-half hour movie. It is filmed in such a way that the events that unfold could involve you, your neighbor, somebody across town and on your local news. Along with the way the movie is filmed and told, it is gifted with phenomenal actors that bring the reality of the situation to the surface.\n\nIt is an exhausting an emotionally filled movie from top to bottom and its subject matter will have your stomach in knots until the credits roll. This, quite simply, is what movies are all about. Too often these days, movies make you feel nothing. Too many directors and writers are concerned with what you see and forget that first and foremost, what makes great cinema and long lasting cinema, is the feeling it leaves in your stomach and soul. At one point, Keller Dover's sadness effected me so much that I felt as if I was actually him or in the least, one of his family members or a great friend.\n\n\"Prisoners\" is the kind of movie we should be flocking to the theaters to see until Hollywood gets the message that we want to feel something. Sure, dazzle us with visuals, but until you relay empathy in your audience members, you have wasted millions of dollars and time. \"Prisoners\" is tremendous filmmaking. It is one of the best and most complete films of the year and will almost certainly be a member of the Oscar night nominees.",

Knowing that every day, every hour, every second your child could be alone, frightened, and worst of all dead. That is the dreaded crux of the core to this film. Keller (Hugh Jackman) is a rustic strong family man, raising a beautiful family. During a holiday dinner with family friends Franklin (Terrence Howard) and Nancy (Violla Davis), both of their younger daughters decide to go play outside in which they never return. The only suspect, the owner of an RV that was suspiciously parked out in the neighborhood. In comes Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) heading up the investigation of the missing children. \n\n The investigation follows a strange path of multiple suspects, neither of which are connected, and the prime suspect, the first suspect, is released from holding after having absolutely no evidence to having kidnapped the children. The prime suspect, Alex (Paul Dano), is an infantile man who knows more than he is letting on. Keller having no faith in Loki's ability to find his daughter, takes matters into his own hands, kidnapping Alex himself and keeping him \"prisoner\", torturing and abusing him trying to get the truth from him. While Loki follows multiple leads of suspicious people, clues that don't match, incidences that turn into dead ends, Keller struggles with maintaining the guise of a father searching for his lost daughter while actually spending his time punishing Alex through violence.\n\n As the tale unfolds and tragedy besets both families worrisome clues start to connect and the tenuous relationship between Keller and Loki threatens the entire investigation. Loki is plagued with the desire to save the girls. As is Keller. But their methods take them to the edge of justice careening close to the depths of vengeance.\n\n While the entire film is tense and driven by a very powerful emotion it is not the most memorable thriller that is out there. This is based solely on the story itself. The crime and solving it is not why you watch this film. You watch this film for one of the most brilliant ensemble performances from a cast of super heavy weights, all of which give fantastic gut wrenching tear jerking performances about the pain, fear, and anger of losing a child. I think it is less about it being \"memorable\" in the way Se7en or Gone Baby Gone was but the performances and the wonderful cinematography by the one and only Roger Deakins makes it a strong watch. Definitely worth a view.",

It perhaps isn't quite as important or Oscar-worthy as it seems to think it is, but it's a really compelling film nevertheless.\nHugh Jackman stars as a blue-collar guy whose 6-year-old daughter is kidnapped. Jake Gyllenhaal plays the detective investigating the case, in a surprisingly interesting performance. When Jackman's character quickly grows frustrated with the police's lack of progress, he decides to do some investigating himself, kidnapping a potential suspect (Paul Dano, typecast yet again as a creepy weirdo) and torturing him for information.\n\nThe movie's plot, as it moves along, can seem fairly standard, though there are definitely some late-game twists I didn't see coming. What's more remarkable about the film is its constant sense of gray, rainy misery, which is really bolstered by Roger Deakins's work. The movie doesn't have as many pointedly stylish shots as, say, Skyfall, but it does a great job with shadows and darkness. It's arguably a good example of a color film noir, at least in the visual style of certain scenes. To be honest, at its core, this could have been an average movie, but the talent of everyone involved raised it considerably.

I know that the film's plot has been done before in other films or TV shows, but it's the execution that makes it stand out which is very effectively done. Hugh Jackman gives a powerhouse performance and gives it his all that I find him very convincing, and I was surprised that he didn't get nominated for an Academy Award in this. Jake Gyllenhaal is fantastic in this and Maria Bello gives an emotional performance that you can see how broken her character was after her child had been kidnapped. Paul Dano, Melissa Leo, Viola Davis, and Terrence Howard are really good that there is no actor that wasn't bad in this. The script by Aaron Guzikowski is very well-written that it really made the film more complex than to get the audience invested, but not too complex to lose the viewers and get very confused. The characters are simple, but memorable enough that you really want the main characters to find their daughters, even when they take Paul Dano's character hostage. It really gets tense at times, and the reveal is really good. Prisoners is a very smart film that got me riveted from beginning to end.",

There's something fundamentally human about the story, but Denis Villeneuve also weaves in an ominous sense of cultural desperation that seems to originate from 9/11.\n\nHugh Jackman is, as always, excellent as the father whose rationality becomes increasingly clouded by rage. The movie really belongs to Jake Gyllenhaal though, as the investigating officer who is equally frustrated by the constraints of the legal system and also a slave to its proven methods.",

Well, I for one am not afraid of a little darkness - or even a lot, as in this case.\n\nThe performances here are sublime.  Hugh Jackman is a force of nature as a father channeling the fear for his daughter into brutal action.  Jake Gyllenhaal is the detached, perceptive detective with little tolerance for human interaction.  But the real treat is Paul Dano, who manages to be menacing, meek, and empathetic without saying very much at all. \n\nCombine all this with immersive cinematography and a gripping plot, and you've got yourself a gaze into the abyss of what humans are willing to do to find answers.",

The mystery keeps you guessing until the end the reveal is far less shocking as the transformation each character undergoes. The film is disturbing, but not so disturbing that it's inaccessible. Instead, the film digs under your skin and tries to include you in the suffering the parents are going through. You want answers not because you're curious about the outcome, but because you genuinely want to see the conflict resolved. Everyone is excellent in term of performance and the film is well written. There are a few scenes I thought could have been executed better, but for the most part the film is exceptional. I would recommend watching it, but I'll only sit through it once.",

Conversely, Hugh Jackman's performance, while good, is just a little over the top. An emotionally powerful performance doesn't always involve screaming at the top of your lungs in every scene and unfortunately that's the lasting impression I had from him here. \n\nI also found the story suffered from a few too many plot holes in my opinion. Having said that, the Denis Villeneuve did a fantastic job of creating a dark, cold, dreadful atmosphere that permeated the film and really created a sense of despair. I enjoyed this much more than I did his most recent film (Enemy). Overall, I would say this is worth seeing, especially for Gyllenhaal's underrated performance alone.",

All of the acting is great, showung the change that the situation has brought and being hurt by it so perfectly. As for the mystery it is solid, actually the most intriguing mysteey recently. The screenplay helps bring out emotion and has plenty of good lines and moments to bring, and the dark cinematography brings a tone that the movie hits perfectly. How this movie was nominated for only one Oscar, I dont know, but the Academy should be damn ashamed, since this movie packed more substantial human drama than even 12 Years a Slave, and that movie was damn good too. 4 1/2 stars, so close to 5... oh, and not for the faint hearted, some people arent big fans of it because its too dark, well so is kidnapping, so shouldnt it be?",

            "content": "Prisoners has a very strong draw. The story pulls you in almost immediately and does a great job of not letting go. The immediate premise alone is horrific to extreme levels and its possibility is so real that it can put its viewers in a very vulnerable emotional place. There are particular aspects that place viewers in this state but not in an overtly obvious way. The structure takes its time to draw us in while feeding us tiny moments of youthful innocence that serves to trigger a sentimentality that quite literally sneaks up on us. All the while at the same time we are faced with feeling of complete dread as the story unfolds.  You may begin to feel as helpless as some of the characters facing this nightmare. \n    \n       The imagery in this film is scattered but grotesquely beautiful. We have the whistle, which is always red, the images of the mazes, the Cross, snakes, and the manikins; none of which have too much purpose save for making the situation more bizarre and disturbing. The storyline all-together is intriguing enough though without all that extra imagery. Where the story truly pulls you in is in the behavior of Keller (Hugh Jackman) to the situation. I've read some believe he \"over acts\" but I don't agree with that at all given the circumstances. Keller's intensity is completely believable though his actions are extreme. Detective Loki (Gyllenhaal) is only slightly developed beyond his involvement of the case but we are given subtle glimpses at who he might be which suggests he is actually the perfect man for the case. He ought to be since his office seems to be fairly incompetent and leaves him without a partner on this investigation.\n\n   I felt the cinematography was sufficient but not something to lose yourself in. The editing is very good as it allows you time to soak in the moments that are the most critical. Too often do films rush us through a roller coaster while we miss all emotion stimulation. The music is dreary with its use of violins and synthesizers and does a good job working with the footage. \n\n  Prisoners is a good film for those who enjoy thrillers. I recommend giving it a watch.",

In this dark and moody scenario, Director Denis Villeneuve explores the question of what actions parents will take trying to save their children, and what rationale they will use to justify those actions.  Villeneuve uses weather to accentuate the dark mood of the film well, and we find out how religion can be used to justify the most brutal acts.

Of course the audience knows that all is not well in this suburban-Pennsylvania town; we've seen the previews, we know the story. Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) knows what can go wrong as well. An out-of-work carpenter, Jackman phenomenally brings to life the survivalist mentality which has dictated and guided his life up to the beginning of the film: the day that his daughter is stolen from him. \n\nThis film is brooding,accentuated by a palate of grays and blacks, but fully brought to life by complex performances by Jake Gyllenhaal as the detective charged with returning the girls to safety, as well as Melissa Leo, who adds another polished role to her resume on par with her portrayal of Alice Ward in The Fighter. Detective Loki (Gyllenhaal) plays a foil of sorts to Dover, and he always inexplicably knows where to find the dead body (he's never failed to close a case). Screenwriter Aaron Guzikowski doesn't go so far as to make us doubt Loki's motives, only to question his background and breadth of knowledge about such a dark world. We're never privy to many of these answers.\n\nIf Prisoners misses the mark anywhere, it is in length. This weighty slog thrills and holds our pulses high, but at two hours and thirty-three minutes, we're completely devoid of the ability to take any more. I liken Prisoners to getting smacked across the face, but the reward for your endurance is an extraordinary film, reaching the upper echelon of the genre. You'll be ready for a walk after the lights go up,yet the plot never drags. Like any crime thriller, certain tangents and red herrings are followed to a fault. However, these ploys successfully disguise other critical elements of the trail, enabling them to go unnoticed until their importance needs to be revisited. Loki misses these details simply because of the mass of evidence he has to investigate; Dover misses them because he is otherwise distracted in a gritty battle that is sure to test your stomach. \n\nThis film succeeds because it keeps its foot on the accelerator. A story like Prisoners has a tendency to either slow to a halt about twenty minutes before the climax, or rely on a character to break the tension from time to time.Director Denis Villeneuve decided to rise above that. Rather than cheapen a well-written script with a sideshow or a plot intermission, he keeps the tension high thanks to a deathly quiet soundtrack, a multitude of parallel stories, and depth to characters fully brought out by this incredible cast. \n\nPrisoners is taxing and cumbersome. The darkness of the subject entraps you and will force you to consider what you just saw. But isn't that what movies are supposed to do?\n\nRead more reviews at RJGFilmAnalysis.com",

            "content": "For a 'catch the bad guy' film, this one is particularly divisive due to its unnerving brutality. As the film nears its end whilst only managing to become darker and more unpleasant, it's clear that the viewer is either going to be trapped in the clutches of its horrid atmosphere or they're going to have drawn the line and wished they'd never started watching to begin with. Either way, the film's commitment to its pitch-black atmosphere makes it something relatively unique for the genre.\n\nYou'll certainly feel queasy after this one and its cruelty that verges on sadism will be enough to put many off. If, like myself, you decide not to draw the line and let that go as it were then you may still feel that this film was a missed opportunity through its emphasis on being a crime thriller rather than the human drama that turns out only being a sliver of the overall work. Still, if you want a crime thriller that'll keep you engaged whilst being memorable and feeling somewhat distinct from the genre as a whole, then this is for you.\n\nThe plot just manages to tow the line between being interesting and simply becoming overly-ridiculous. It's certainly convoluted and not as smart as it wants to be (you could figure most of it out pretty early on if you tried) but it does a good job in creating convincing mystery and uncertainty within its characters as the story develops. Even if the viewer does say enough is enough as the plot twists and turns, they'll still be tied to how the characters react to these developments. It's still a little ridiculous though if I'm honest!\n\nThe cast fit well and never seem out of place. Jackman, who I'm honestly not particularly fond of, fits this role like a glove and felt like smart casting for a character that seems to be driven more by revenge than by sorrow. Gyllenhaal overdid it a little for me at times- trying a little too hard to be the damaged cop however he doesn't become a caricature and he doesn't bring the film down at all. \n\nDano ultimately doesn't get to do much which is disappointing but he plays his part well- the same could be said of Howard, Bello, and Davis, whose characters all may as well have been named 'distraught person crying' as none of them ever really step into the story in their own way. Due to its focus on atmosphere and its trying-too-hard plot, this film could easily have fallen apart with a lesser cast so its good to see them meeting expectations here.\n\nThe film has a very interesting premise as the response of Jackman's character to the abduction of his daughter serves as half of  the film's main focus, with the search for the criminal serving as the other half. This makes it stand out a little but in the end it's rather disappointing as the story veers more and more towards your typical crime thriller until Jackman's character just serves as an extension of that. The opportunities to discuss the moral and ethical implications of Davis' actions end up completely lost to the more formulaic aspects of the crime thriller parts of the story. As a result, the film slowly becomes less-interesting, despite the plot continuing to move at a decent pace.\n\nThis is my main issue with the film and there's really no excuse for it. It has a fairly significant runtime and yet it's paced well enough to avoid feeling painfully long and dragged on. Why some of this time wasn't used to focus on the moral struggle surrounding the events in the film is a question worth asking as it certainly would have enhanced the impact of the movie. It's certainly haunting when all is said and done but it's a particularly queasy feeling as opposed to an emotional one that the viewer is left with. It's an all-visceral response that this film brings out and I'd have preferred something more emotional and introspective in the end which this film didn't seem particularly interested in.\n\nOverall, if you can accept its overbearingly depressing nature, then you've got something here that stands out from your average crime thriller, even if it does seem to have let itself down a little.",

            "content": "\"a gritty, incredibly well-acted, suspenseful, thought-provoking crime drama thriller\" \nWow, what an intensely suspenseful film Prisoners was. The film commences with a naturalistic and peaceful look of a suburban neighborhood, leafless trees calmly swaying along with the cool air that encompass them. All is fine, and a perfectly normal family visits their friends/neighbors for a delightful dinner and some music. Everything is fine and dandy until both family's two kids run off to retrieve a toy they left outside. After pleasant conversation, the two families begin to realize that their kids haven't gotten back yet. The noiseless environment around them feels incredibly unusual, and once they realize that their kids have officially gone missing, chaos breaks loose. We are suddenly presented with a ruthless father (played by Hugh Jackman) who loves his daughter so much that he's willing to transcend any morally difficult obstacles to hopefully locate her. \n\nA spectacular cast, ranging from the likes of Hugh Jackman to Jake Gyllenhaal to Viola Davis and Terrence Howard, create such a chilling atmosphere that everyone in the audience immediately notices the discomforting subject matter as they prepare for a disturbing viewing. One should know prior to visiting the movie theater that this film doesn't feature morally perfect individuals. They are all human beings cast into an unbelievably frightening situation, and this is where larges amounts of debate will stir. There's one side of the audience that will persistently detest the characters' actions and the characters themselves, and there's the other side (which I am proudly a part of) that will essentially understand that people can't possibly (always) be the \"goody-two-shoes\" heroes, perceived in Hollywood blockbusters, in reality- that, by god, I will partake morally and ethically questionable activities to save a precious, loved one, absolutely! Such conversation/argument is healthy for it proves the memorability factor of the film itself. After you witness the terrifically-crafted picture, you will find enjoyment in discussing the movie's events with friends and family with- eventually- two sides forming over the talk. \n\nAnd holy crap is Hugh Jackman entirely convincing in his performance. You can see the longing to find his sweet, innocent daughter through his miserable eyes, filled with redness, desperation, and anger. Then, there's Jake Gyllenhaal as the second lead, playing an ambitious cop who holds a very impressive resume: no unsolved cases left under his plate. Can that mean his skill will greatly help in this predicament? On a similar note, Paul Dano takes the prize after Hugh Jackman for another wonderful performance. No offense or anything, but he completely fits into these immensely creepy and eerie roles. \n\nSpeaking of, the soundtrack will definitely remain in that shocked mind of yours long after you've left the theater because it fills us with a sense of hopelessness and discomfort. At times, it sounds exceptionally ominous with the disconcerting sound of those violins in play. At others, it sounds like the music weeps for all those involved. The pace never seems to drag even though it clocks in at around 150 minutes as you remain at the edge of seat the entire time, utterly perplexed by everything that's transpiring and wholly befuddled by the choices that these people are making. The film will make you cringe and question the humanity of the participants or the competence of our law (that word could mean two things). Although I was slightly disappointed with the end result, the majority of the film strongly intrigued me. And, oh, how could I forget, the cinematography is simply amazing. Roger Deakins, the brilliant cinematographer behind last year's Skyfall, manages the camera-work of this film as well. As one wise critic said, a drive in the rain never felt so disquieting- a moment of foreboding. \n\nFurthermore, I would not recommend skipping out on Prisoners unless you're of the type that prefers more lighthearted and fun movies like The Avengers. If you love films that explore more than just entertainment and \"fun,\" such as important themes and moral ambiguity as a whole, you cannot go wrong with Prisoners. With a mix of top-notch cinematography, remarkably unsettling music, superb performances, and a thrilling/powerful story, Prisoners will definitely be one of this year's features that I'll surely be remembering. The true cinema season has started; now, let's hope every film from here on out delivers like this one did.",

A lot of the film's exposition establishes Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) as a survivalist -- a right-wing, anti-establishmentarian -- in order to explain his extreme behavior later.  But this theme remains undeveloped.  I can imagine a good film that questions whether a man's personal moral compass should override the moral compass that most reasonable people agree to, but by the second act, the film devolves into torture porn and the generic dramatic questions overtake the film's philosophical musings.\nJackman has never been an impressive actor, and what depth we see in Keller comes from the script, not his performance.  The same can be said of Jake Gyllenhaal, and unfortunately the plot renders Maria Bello catatonic halfway through the film.  The best performance is by Paul Dano, who never fails to impress.\nOverall, as a thriller, Prisoners fits the genre, but as anything more, it's close but not quite.",

Jake Gyllenhaal and Paul Dano, however, are both great all the way through; and the way director Denis Villeneuve retains the sense of dread throughout is almost masterful. \n\nWhat's really scary is that Jackman's character is actually capable of going so far mentally outside his comfort zone to get his daughter back. Now over the past few years I personally have learned a lot (and am still learning) about self-control; but his character is scary; unfortunately Jackman's over-acting really does not help this character's credibility- in fact, I had a hard time believing him. He achieved the basics of the performance- character establishment- but none of the more complex parts of the performance, unfortunately. \n\nOverall, it's a very good movie- difficult to watch, but I will say it's worth it.",

For almost a year now friends have been telling me that I needed to see this and it is very realistic and all that other stuff. So I decided one weekend, \"What the hell\" and rent the movie only to finish it off and say to myself \"WHAT THE HELL?\" From I hear this is something that people say that it is one of the best movies of 2013. It's one of those movies that did really well at the Toronto International Film Festival so I can say that there are some I get what they're talking about and some things that I can't. This is a pretty dark film and a really cool mystery, so let me dive right on in this movie.\n\nThe movie brings a lot of things to the table with one of which being is this right or wrong when you do what you have to do in order to find your children? Like the degree to which they lose all sense of their sensibility to become this crazy person who morality becomes neither here nor there and the only thing that matters is them and their own shit. Hugh Jackman gives, without a doubt, one of the best performances that I have ever seen in his entire career. He delivers a mixture of seriousness and animosity that makes you believe that there are people like this that do exist out there in the real world. I mean if you put his character in a room with the Hugh Jackman version of Wolverine, there's no doubt that he'll beat the ever loving shit out of the mutant. I'm going to tell you something else, if you want someone to play nervous in your movies then get Terrance Howard. This guy plays nervous like nobody else. I loved Jake Gyllenhaal in here as well as plays this stressed out detective who is constantly frustrated whenever he can't solve a clue or when the parents are his back about the case. Everyone else in here from Paul Dano to Maria Bello, and even Melissa Leo were spectacular in this movie and not a single role felt like it was wasted. One complaint I had with this is that this movie is two and a half hours and there are scenes in here that just drags on for so long that they could've easily taken it out. The whole middle act has this whole morality play that is not really going anywhere about Hugh Jackman having this guy tied up certain that he is the one who did it and you're like \"Okay maybe we should have something else happening in the plot that moves the story along. It could lose some people when they watch this, but it didn't lose me. Overall I enjoyed the hell out of this movie and if you have a lot of time to kill then I recommend this. This is, without a doubt, a solid four stars all the way.",

Hugh Jackman plays Keller Dover, a God fearing survivalist who is disempowered from his state of readiness when his daughter is kidnapped alongside one of his neighbours. He plays the character in an extremely raw and emotionally driven way, which acts to counterbalance the cooler, collected Detective Loki played by Jake Gyllenhaal. He too is at the top of his game, alongside a formidable supporting cast including Terrence Howard and Viola Davis.\n\nThe exceptional cast is helped by a screenplay which never stops putting the audience through their paces...\n\nRead more",

Coming to mind, the film is heavily similar to Insomnia, probably one of Nolan's more conventional films, but the ideas and cinematic flair are still present here.  Again, the twist isn't too shocking (especially again if you know the pedigree of the casting....) but it's still one that keeps you guessing throughout the entire film.  Jackman and Gyllenhaal really carry the movie with decent performances from the supporting.  It's sadly way too long.  If the movie focused more on Loki vs Jackman's torturing, I think it could had had a slicker feel to it.  Instead, you just keep wishing it go back to the story instead of the meaningless red herrings.  Overall, it's a strong movie and a recommendation (which I don't say often), but it's more a \"one and done\" great story like Insomnia was, versus one that needs to be returned to to find everything it offers.  There is complexity in their natures, but it overall doesn't fully reach its needed potential.",

The success of the film is down to a really intricate plot and a terrific cast, all putting some magnificent and electrifying performances. Carpenter Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) is a very devout Catholic whose family goes for Thanksgiving dinner with their neighbours, Franklyn and Nancy Birch (Terrence Howard and Viola Davis). After dinner, the families girls Anna Dover (Erin Gerasimovich) and Joy Birch (Kyla Drew Simmons) go missing, prompting a search led by Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal). The main suspect is Alex Jones (Paul Dano), who had an RV parked nearby, but Jones has the mental age of a little boy, and they can't prove he did it. Dover believes Jones did it, so he takes the law into his own hands, but Loki discovers some dark secrets about this particular case. It's a film you will need to watch again, as all the clues are spread throughout the film, but they're not very clear, and you will need to pay attention to.

            "content": "Thanksgiving is a time of love and gratitude, cherishing jubilant moments over a warm, oven-roasted turkey around a table with family and friends. This is precisely what the Birch and Dover families, whom are neighbors and close friends, are expecting when attending a Thanksgiving dinner at the Birch residence. There is a deep sense of comfort and connectedness between the two families as they prepare for their quiet, pleasant evening. With a title like Prisoners, it comes as no surprise that the events in this film do not unfold peacefully for these charming families.\n\nThe grizzly events of Prisoners begin when Anna Dover and Joy Birch, the two six-years-olds from each respective family, decide to play outdoors. They are accompanied by their older siblings and soon come across what appears to be an abandoned RV, which the two young girls begin to climb before their older siblings force them off as they return for dinner. It is only shortly before dinner that both families realize their two six-year-old daughters are nowhere to be found, and upon searching their homes and the surrounding area, panic begins to set in. \n\nThe authorities are contacted immediately, and Detective Loki, played by Jake Gyllenhaal, leads the case. He takes a detailed account of the events that took place before the girls went missing, and shortly thereafter, he finds the RV by which the girls had played. A young man residing inside the RV is then arrested for the accused kidnapping, but further investigation proves it is highly improbable for this man to be the skilled kidnapper-he has the IQ of an average 10-year-old and is awkwardly simple-minded. The plot thickens as Keller Dover, played by Hugh Jackman, decides to take matters into his own hands and find the two missing girls himself, using unskillful detective-work and sadistically violent measures as he sees fit. Keller and Detective Loki progressively discover that there are a multitude of complex clues they must piece together in this intense enigma if they hope to find the two young girls alive.\n\nWhile slow-paced at times, Prisoners never fails to keep you gripped, scanning every shot for clues and questioning the trustworthiness of each character. Like the title of the film, we too become prisoners of the crime and the agitation the young girls and their distraught families are experiencing. Prisoners is by no means a blissful or straightforward film. However, it reaches deeply into the heart of humanity and the darkness that we are capable of as human beings, whether for love or for malice.",

            "content": "Prisoners had a lot to live up to. Just look at that cast; Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Viola Davis, Melissa Leo, etc. All actors at least nominated for Oscars, if not having actually won them. There is a lot of talent acting in the film, but any actor is only as good as the material they are handed. So what was the end result?\n\nIn short, the most gripping, edge of your seat film I have ever seen. I have never been floored by a movie, or infused with so much anxiety from a film. I was shaking, and hardly able to stand up from my seat as the credits rolled. I don't have many criticisms of this film myself, but I'd like to refute many of the criticism I've seen below.\nThe most common aspect of the film I've seen complained about is the length. The film is long, running at just under 2 hours and 30 minutes. It has been said that the film delves down every avenue, guiding the viewer through sequences that may not be necessary to the overall plot of the film.\n\nI couldn't disagree more.\n\nThe film may be long, but it never felt long to me because every single scene felt completely essential to the film, even if it didn't seem so at the time, by the end, it all comes together. Sure, they could have streamlined the narrative, made it a little more linear, but the film would have suffered for it. The film is littered with characters, but that long running time gives us more than enough time to spend time with them, get to know them, and let them develop properly.\n\nIt also gives the film time to completely subvert your expectations of it multiple times. There will, undoubtedly, be several times during the film that you will think you've got it all figured out, but then something will happen that completely throws you off. But then, it will do it again. And at the end, you may end up somewhere that is somewhat predictable, but the journey of how you get there is thrilling.\n\nAnother complaint I've seen echoed from several reviewers is with the brutality of the film. But the violence of the film serves a greater purpose, conveys the social commentary on display, and isn't just violence for the sake of violence or shock value. Now, the violence is shocking, but in context, and with relation to the overall narrative, it is essential. How far would a parent go to find their children? Or, what lengths would a parent go to comfort themselves, and convince themselves their child is still alive? The film asks one of these questions, but leaves it up to you to decide which one.\n\nI'd urge you, that if you see the film, pay attention and appreciate every detail. Even when you may think the narrative is losing its way, stay vigil, because the payoff for everything will be there in the end. The last 30 minutes of this film will surprise you and have you on edge like you may never have been before. Everything comes together in that span of time, but it does not feel like it is rushing towards a conclusion, in the traditional sense. It is more like it is rocketing towards a finale that is fast and frantic because it has to be.\n\nI apologize if it seems I am beating around the bushes on some of these subjects, but I absolutely abhor reviews that are unable to tell you what is great about a film without telling you exactly what happens. Spoilers are a big deal to me, and many others, and I try to keep that in mind.\n\nAlthough Hugh Jackman has top billing, to me Jake Gyllenhaal steals the show here. His character of Detective Loki is most of the time a very subdued character, but he always gives off the sense that something much more is boiling beneath the surface. And when that side of him comes out, Gyllenhaal is a complete and utter powerhouse. Don't get me wrong; Hugh Jackman does wonderful work here, but if you've seen Hugh Jackman before, even just as Wolverine, you'll know that he can pull off angry and ferocious. It's good work, but it's nothing quite out of his wheelhouse. Even all the supporting roles are great and well acted, because the receive the screen time they need to have a full arc as characters.\n\nI don't think I could gush any more about Prisoners without going into specifics, but in short, I implore you to see this movie. If you're a fan of great drama, horror, or just movies in general, this will be a very enjoyable, although somewhat brutal, breath of fresh air. If it meets all the foolish Oscar qualifying guidelines, this will, without a doubt, be one to watch in the coming award season.",

There are many levels of humanity that are explored in the film that all fall under the darker aspects of the human persona: wrath, depression, cowardliness, suspicion, deceit, etc. which in turn creates a very dark and sometimes dreary tone that may not be for everybody. Just remember that this is a movie and if you have to react harshly to the evil that is portrayed in the film then treat it, once again, as a reminder to the evil that lurks out in the world.",

Or even more recently in the overrated \"Mystic River\" which to me felt like a gloried made-for-TV movie of the week.  More recently \"The Impossible\" dealt with a separated family (Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor) who helped each other out after a giant tsunami.\nEmpathy factor runs high on this compelling drama in which Jackman's 7- year-old daughter goes missing after a Thanksgiving rendezvous. I would say I really didn't enjoy this flick, but more or less respected what first time director Denis Villenueve was trying to accomplish with this pretzel twisting  mystery/thriller.  \nA heavily tattooed Jake Gyllenhaal is the cop assigned to help Jackman's Keller Dover track down the logistics in figuring out the dynamics of the strange case.  \nPaul Dano, so good in the little seen \"The Girl Next Door\" and Paul Anderson's \"There Will be Blood\" underplays his role as Alex Jones, a kid who has no more than an 8th grade education.  Even though one feels his pain, one can't help but to be dumbfounded by his predicament.  \nRounding out the cast in great support are Terrence Howard, Viola Davis, Maria Bello and Oscar winner Melissa Leo as Holly Jones, Alex's caregver.\nA tough flick to endure, \"Prisoners\" at least ends with a glimmer of surprise and hope by film's end.\n\n(B-)",

Hugh Jackman leaves his Wolverine Muttonchops on the makeup stand for a while to portray the proactive father of one of the missing girls and while the entire cast is spot-on, it's the twists and turns that are the heart of this movie.  In a world full of predictability, I found this to be a more interesting ride than I bargained for.

            "content": "Prisoners (Denis Villeneuve, 2013)\n\nI'll be up front with you: I am writing the first sentences of this review, which I expect will be a very long one, without knowing what rating I will actually be giving Prisoners. I believe that somewhere over the course of the thousands of reviews I have written (Amazon is home to over six thousand of them as of this writing, on October 5, 2013, and I had been reviewing steadily for longer before I started posting there than I have been since I started, so you can do the math...) that has probably happened before...but I can't remember it, if it has. I have a great deal to mull over before figuring that out, I think. I liked it, overall; there is a great deal to like about it. It is surprisingly well-paced for having come out of a film culture where directors are actively encouraged to make their films about half as long as this one (this is the only film I have seen made in the last fifteen years that is this long that is not either (a) a musical, (b) a Shah Rukh Khan vehicle, or (c ) both of the above), it is unflinching in its examination of violence, its script is intelligent and multi-layered (though it does overplay its hand now and again), it is impeccably-cast, and I could keep going like this all night without really digging into the film at all. But it is not perfect, and while I admit I finished watching it less than an hour and a half before I am writing the opening words of this review, the more I think about the nagging questions I walked out of the theater with, the more they nag at me. Time will tell (and probably will, before I finish writing this review, which will probably be a few weeks from now-if I follow standard operating procedure with it, anyway) if they continue to nag, but the biggest thing that bothered me, and my first impression is that much of this comes from Jake Gyllenhaal being one of the male leads, is that I saw a lot of Zodiac in this movie. I also saw a lot of Snowtown, which is harder to explain away. That made some of what unfolded on the screen before me more predictable than, I think, it should have been; almost certainly more than screenwriter Aaron Guzikowski (Contraband) intended. But we shall see after I keep mulling it over; I'm going to go do some more of that right now.\n\nPlot: Keller Dover (X-Men's Hugh Jackman) and Frankin Burch (Hustle and Flow's Terrence Howard) are friends in the suburbs. They get together for Thanksgiving; their daughters go out, saying they're heading over to the other house to do whatever it is that preteen girls do away form the prying eyes of their parents. They never make it. Suspicion is immediately cast on a broken-down old camper that has been seen in the area; when the police track it down in the dark corner of a convenience store parking lot, they find its driver to be young mentally-challenged Alex Jones (The Good Heart's Paul Dano). The police, in the form of one Detective Loki (The Day After Tomorrow's Jake Gyllenhaal), interrogate Jones, but do not have enough evidence to go anywhere with it; he is ultimately released, leading Dover to take matters into his own hands. Initially, Burch goes along with Dover's plan for extracting information, but the longer things go one, the more Dover pulls away not only from Burch, but from the rest of his life. Eventually, people start noticing that Alex has gone missing, and Detective Loki's focus hones in on Dover.\n\nAnd now back to my initial paragraph, which I wrote five months before this one. About 80% of this movie is phenomenal, a thought-provoking journey into the motivations and actions of people who are driven to desperation. The other 20% feels as if it were tacked on for a commercial audience who would not be satisfied with that and needed some sort of conventional mystery to resolve. It's trite, relies on plot twists you've seen in half a hundred other movies of its ilk, and while it is as well-presented as the rest of the movie-these are all fine actors turning in fine performances, Villeneuve (Incendies) certainly knows his way around a camera, and  Roger Deakins was nominated for an Oscar for his chilling cinematography (he lost to, of course, Gravity)-it still feels kind of like the old Irving Pichel trick of \"hey, we finished shooting a week early and have some extra stock, let's make another movie!\"...except this time they stitched the two together, and the graft didn't quite take. The straight mystery at the end is watchable, but in juxtaposition to the drama/thriller/horror film that comes before it, it pales. Should you see it? Absolutely. Is it, as IMDB would have us believe as I am writing this in March 2014, one of the 250 best movies ever made (it is sitting at #249)? Not on your life. ***  1/2",

            "content": "Kidnapping is one of the most terrifying experiences any parent can go through. For this reason, 'Prisoners' has got to be one of the most depressing, conflicted films in recent memory. Two families nightmares become reality on Thanksgiving Day when their young daughters disappear in broad daylight. The ensuing pursuit led by the understandably enraged fathers Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) and Franklin Birch (Terrence Howard) and their defeated wives (played by Maria Bello and Viola Davis) is dramatic, uncomfortable and shocking. There are so many twists and turns throughout this film, it's hard to say which way is up. Quickly, the focus shifts to Alex Jones, a slow young man who was driving his RV around the families' neighborhood when the girls disappeared, and Keller becomes obsessed with interrogating him after he's released due to a lack of evidence. Also integral to 'Prisoners' is detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal), who does his best to please Keller but is equally dedicated to following protocol and relying on his perfect record of rescuing kidnapping victims. The friction that develops between Keller and Loki is top-notch. There is also a clear theme of religion throughout 'Prisoners,' with Keller's devout Catholicism and the loss of faith recounted by Alex's aunt, Holly Jones (portrayed brilliantly by Melissa Leo). Still, there are plenty of areas for criticism of 'Prisoners,' including its runtime and the unsettling scenes of torture carried out by Keller. For this reason, he loses most of the sympathy his character had at the outset of the film, although there is an underlying sense of pity towards his character throughout the film. Much has been made of the final scene of the film, but it is a very fitting way to end such tumultuous story. While 'Prisoners' puts the grit in gritty, it is a powerful film that will remain with you long after you watch it.",

That may not seem to match a 4 1/2 star rating but the relief came because now I could reflect on the movie and not endure more subjection of mystery, horror, and pure villainy. One thing is clear, the evil in this story DOES change the good people on the other side of the board. Just as in our world, evil affects us in many ways seen and unseen, despite our best beliefs that we have everything under control. Villeneuve's choices in direction, scene play, and character exploration, supported by Aaron Guzikowski's fantastic script, act as a boxer who has you pinned in the ring as he hammers at your skull and chest. You can't escape or deny the images playing out in front of you. You feel yourself in the characters and you steadily begin to relate to Jackman's descent, Gyllenhaal's determination, and Howard's indecision. This is where Prisoners offers its best. It's not in the premise of two kidnapped daughters, it's in the reasons behind why people do what they do because they've been cheated, hurt, abused, and forgotten. Melissa Leo pulls a bag over your eyes then proceeds to tell you what you see. The film reaches into depths that many would leave unanswered for fear of finding what's there. Questions of how far is too far, what is necessary, and where does wrong become right and vice versa are just the beginning in one of the toughest movies I've ever watched. Be wary if you have kids, but for anyone interested, this is worth the time and stress.",

Gyllenhaal plays a dogged detective with a seemingly mild case of tourrette's (he blinks his eyes oddly and excessively).  The tale is laid out like a maze. Nothing connects in straight lines. Jackman's role as the recovered alcoholic dad who has a gut feeling he's found a suspect, and his brutality as a result of this, are a bit much, but the rest of the characters, action and screenplay are tight and amazingly executed.

            "content": "An incredibly ambitious movie that is only, slightly, undone by its sprawling length and fairly predictable \"twist\" in the third act of the story.  This film isn't afraid to ask some really tough and disturbing questions, but it also has the strength to face them head on and not shy away from anything because it might be considered a sensitive subject.  The film is definitely morally complex and there's no one simple answer to the questions the film makes the audience ask.  I think that's the film's biggest positive, the fact that it doesn't shy away from the disturbing aspects of its story.  If I was put into this same situation that Keller found himself in, I don't think I'd have the heart to do what he did, even if I was a parent.  Because there's still that doubt, which Keller never had, that maybe Alex wasn't involved in the things he was accused of.  I'm gonna try my best not to spoil the film, but if I do I'll put a warning beforehand.  The things that Keller did, in his own mind, were justified because of the fact that he was doing his absolute best to get his daughter back.  Almost killing another human being, that may not have been involved, be damned.  That's the debate that the film is trying to bring up, would someone, in this same situation, have the guts to torture another human being for information he may not even be privy to.  As someone that doesn't have children, it'd be easy for me to say no at this moment in my life.  But the fact of the matter is that, at this moment, I can't see myself putting another human being through torturous hell.  Who am I to do that?  I've no right, especially when there's that doubt in your mind that maybe this person is innocent.  If I had 100% proof that this person did it, without a shadow of a doubt, I wouldn't have a problem with it.  But even if you're 99.9% sure, there's still that tiny chance that this person is innocent.  The fact that you'd have to live with that for the rest of your life.  That's gonna haunt you forever.  And even more so when what Keller did was done to someone that was a victim himself, he was a victim of the same people that kidnapped his daughter.  And this will be SPOILER-HEAVY...so skip ahead until I say.  Alex was already traumatized by the experience of being kidnapped at such a young age and being raised by the people that took him, to the point that Alex was no more than 10 years old when it came to mental age.  On top of that you have Keller beating him until his face is barely recognizable and being held hostage in the shower, where Keller would occasionally turn the shower on, from the outside, and have scalding hot water come out and burn the poor kid.  Alex will never be the same again.  By the end of the film, he's returned to his family but it's only obvious that he will never have a normal life again.  It's obvious that his family will have to suffer from the effects of the kidnapping and the abuse Keller put him through.  Keller's actions created waves that will ripple throughout the rest of Alex's life.  I don't think that's something the film really focuses on that much.  Yea, they do bring up that Keller, if found, would go to jail for what he did, but the consequences of his actions aren't fully explored.  The other interesting thing the film brings up is the fact that, whether you agree with his methods or not, Keller's actions, regardless of Alex's innocence or not, did, in fact, lead him to saving his daughter.  He doesn't save her directly, but if he hadn't tortured Alex, Loki wouldn't have found him and he wouldn't have been told by his boss to tell Alex's aunt of what happened to him, then he wouldn't have seen Alex's aunt drugging Anna, Keller's daughter, and he wouldn't have saved her.  Again, Keller indirectly saved his own daughter.  He wouldn't have been able to do this had he not tortured poor Alex.  So it raises some interesting moral conundrums.  There's no easy answer to the questions the film raises, but the film is smart enough to let you make up your own mind rather than shoving an agenda down your throat.  That's about it with the SPOILERS.  Like I said at the beginning, I did have a problem with the third act and how it became too much like a stereotypical suspense/thriller and its too long at times.  But the film benefits from a great cast, an incredible cast with one of Hugh Jackman's best performances, if not his best, and some beautiful cinematography.  So I think that makes the film easier to watch.  I don't think the film should've been cut down by much but 130 minutes would've been a perfect running length for this movie.  Regardless of that, this is still an incredible film that's definitely a very disturbing watch and it's definitely a film that's gonna haunt you long after you're done with it.",

            "content": "Let me start by simply saying this: if you have small children, do me a favor and do not watch this movie! As a man with no children even I was harshly affected by things that are depicted in this movie, to the point where it almost kept me up at night. Child abduction is a sad reality in our world, and I have little doubt that most parents would say they would do anything to get their kids back in that situation. What Prisoners accomplishes is putting that belief to the test...how far are you really willing to go? It seriously makes you think, and at some point you become introspective and start to wonder where you draw the line between right and wrong. That's a remarkable reaction to have when all you're doing is watching a movie. This movie is dark, bleak, and even when something positive happens you find yourself conflicted. There is no clear protagonist or antagonist for most of the film, because it shies away from black & white and takes place almost entirely in the grey. Ordinarily I'd hate that kind of ambiguity, but here it works. \n\nIf you thought Hugh Jackman was intimidating as Wolverine you haven't seen anything yet. His portrayal of Keller is convincingly ruthless. I really believed that he was someone desperately trying to hang onto his sanity, as he fears letting his whole family down by losing his own daughter. Jake Gyllenhaal probably has the easiest role to play, because he seems to be the most level-headed of the characters. Naturally, being a police officer working the case, he has the benefit of not having as strong an emotional investment in the abductions. Yet you see him boil over occasionally as he is clearly impacted by the time spent with grieving families. I was impressed with Paul Dano's performance as a potential suspect. While he didn't have to say much, he did a great job of giving curious looks that kept you wondering whether he was hiding more than it appeared. But, for me, the best performances in Prisoners came from Terrence Howard and Viola Davis. As the parents of the other abductee they gave the viewers a relatable presence and helped ask the questions that you as a viewer were asking as well. Sadly they all but disappear in the second half of the film, which is my primary complaint.\n\nIn the first half of the movie I was so impressed with what they were doing. Although it was very violent, it wasn't gore just for the sake of gore like the Saw films. Instead it was driving the viewer to dark places and led me to question where I would morally draw the line. Do you at some point become the very evil that you seek to eliminate? That's where Terrence Howard and Viola Davis came in so handy, because they vocalized what I was feeling. This was so harsh that it was almost painful watching, but I couldn't look away because it was so well done. Yet somewhere about halfway through the film the entire story shifted gears. Suddenly it was running away from that moral debate, and into a by-the-books murder mystery. Now it is a high quality murder mystery, not a reject episode of CSI or something. It's just kind of disappointing that they changed focus so much. Even if they really wanted to switch themes it would have been nice if they gave a proper resolution to the dark road the first half led us down. No matter what Prisoners was a quality film that impacted me quite a bit. It was hard to watch, and I'm not going to seek it out again, but I'm glad I saw it.",

Leading the investigation is Detective David Loki played by Jake Gyllenhaal who after arresting the driver is on the search but knowing that Keller's daughter Anna's life is at stake, he himself takes matters into his own hands as a maniac is waging a war against god by killing numerous children. The movie itself basically asks you about how far would you go to protect your children. Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal were an unusual duo for the movie but they fit together very well. I haven't seen Jake in a movie for a long time which is why I wanted to watch this film badly and he was as good as always. Prisoners  gets a solid 8.5/10.",

Whilst when ultimately revealed you will find yourself saying \"of course it was\", I personally did not pinpoint the correct person. It was also interesting how the fathers attempt to take matters into their own hands, but ultimately make things worse for themselves; whilst interestingly justifying the title of the film. The two leads portray their characters well; particularly Gyllenhaal.\n\nDespite its considerable length, the film itself did not seem to drag, instead remaining intense and interesting. Whilst each of the components to the case were infact intelligent, the ending left me somewhat disappointed. Many questions were left unanswered, with character links hard to define. A reliance on weak psychological reasoning  for the crime was also unsatisfactory. Of course this may have all been intended, but the links that were provided did seem somewhat desperate, making me want to give the director of the film a call to answer a couple of queries. Despite this, I thoroughly enjoyed this crime thriller, just falling short of 4 stars due to the question provoking ending.",

I did have to watch it in 2 parts the length of the film, at 2 and a half hours, was quite much to keep up with, in that mood. There's loads of twists and turns throughout the movie which keeps it interesting, and the acting from all of the cast was great. The director should have shown some more of the other family that is also going through hell and the ending was left up to the audience to put together, which was a bit weird after getting drawn into the families trauma. The storyline is very well put together and it really does make the audience feel that they are going through the situation with the characters. In all its a great watch but it's quite long. Watchable!\n\nRound-Up:\nHugh Jackman really does show a different side to his usual acting style. If it wasn't for his in depth performance, this movie wouldn't have been half as good. All of the other characters also bring reality to the film which makes the intensity throughout the movie a great watch. Although the film is quite long, I don't think that I would take anything out of the movie. It does flow well and the director really did cover every aspect of a bad situation that every is going through. I don't think that I would have gone with that type of ending, but in all, it's entertaining and enjoyable.\n\nBudget: $46million\nWorldwide Gross: $123million\n\nI recommend this movie to people who are into there deep dramas and kidnap and murder. 7/10",

Prisoners is a film about two families who both of their daughters get kidnapped and both of the families with the help of the police, investigate and look for their daughters. This is a very dark, grim, and at times is a hard film to sit through. That being said, I have created a PainOmeter scale out of five (five being the worst) to inform you guys if you simply cannot take very violent and painful scenes. This will be addressed along will the film's final score. I loved this film! Hugh Jackman plays Anna's father and is the protagonist of the film. You can see how Jackman really loses his rag and does a great job as Keller Dover. There is one scene that involves Jackman doing something that I won't spoil but you will notice it and go WOW! The story is also very thought provoking and will keep you on the edge of your seat because of the direction and character building involved with this movie. Also Paul Dano who plays Alex Jones, is this weird adult with the IQ of a ten year old and is the main suspect of the investigation. I thought he nailed just the right tone of the character and was hard to \"look at\" at times. My favorite part of the film was surprisingly Jake Gyllenhaal's performance as the detective looking for the missing girls. Gyllenhaal still plays the role of a cop very well after all of that training for End Of Watch. Another great part of the film is that it manages to never take a rest on character building and story development. I hate when films give you time to take a break then start all over again and this film really avoids that entirely. I really have no problems with the film except for the runtime. Even though this was a great movie I just couldn't go for a perfect  5.   4 Stars 1-30-14",

That said, it's a little muddled and overlong, but plays out pretty well.  Hugh Jackman (The Wolverine) gives a convincing performance - one that rightly put him in early Oscar buzz, before the art house flicks took over.  It's one of those movies that's chock full of capable actors, but some shine more than others.  I still don't see the appeal of Jake Gyllenhaal (End of Watch), but he's apt in this flick. Viola Davis (Beautiful Creatures) and Mario Bello (Grown Ups 2) shine, Terrance Howard (Lee Daniel's The Butler) turns in his best performance in some time, Paul Dano (Looper) is predictably apt yet strange, and Melissa Leo (Olympus Has Fallen) continues to impress.  Honestly, next to Jackman, she's the standout of the picture.  It's pretty dark, but it's also well-acted, well-paced, and fulfilling enough that it doesn't fit the typical Oscar mold.",

The supporting actors are also terrific, such as Terence Howard as a grieving father and Viola Davis as his grieving wife, Maria Bello as Jackman's drunken wife, Paul Dano as the supposed timid kidnapper and Melissa Leo as Dano's aunt. Roger Deakins' cinematography is bleak and wonderfully supports the film's plot, while Denis Villeneuve's direction is flawless and the script by Aaron Guzikowski is haunting. Throughout the entire film you side with Jackman, while the film takes several terrific twists leading up to a surprising ending. Bravo.",

Especially the night scenes and rainy highways look stunning. The film also has atmospheric sound design.

For this reason the movie went buy rather quickly even though it is certainly longer than the average. I thought the acting was done very well. Hugh Jackman does a better job than I thought playing the father figure, but he really shines when he has to play the tough guy father figure. Jake Gyllenhaal does an equally good job portraying a detective that is put in a difficult situation that creates a tension between the law and moral obligations. I realize that this is R-rated, but I feel it is important to note this movie does have some rather violent and disturbing material. I was even surprised by some of it.

            "content": "Even before I saw the suspenseful and mysterious drama Prisoners, I thought the movie was extremely undersold for a film starring two Oscar-nominated actors as great as Hugh Jackman & Jake Gyllenhaal and directed by Oscar-nominee Denis Villeneuve.  After seeing it, it's definitely surprising how it has stayed under the radar this long.  Villeneuve has created a dark and edgy feel that keeps you uneasy while pulling at your heart to ache for the friends and family of missing persons in general.  Somehow the story struck me as horrific and unbelievable while still lying in the realm of possibility.  \n\tHugh Jackman plays a role I've never seen him attempt and one I think might be different than any he's every played before.  As the father of a six-year-old girl who goes missing with her young friend, Keller Dover (Jackman) makes a very convincing frantic parent.  Having to act out every mother and father's worst nightmare can't be an easy task and Jackman left me impressed, as always.  \n\t  Detective Loki (Gyllenhaal) quickly locates an old RV that had been spotted down the street prior to the girls disappearance and arrests its driver, Alex Jones (Paul Dano).  Although he is the lone suspect and plenty suspicious, a lack of evidence requires them to release him.  Desperate and knowing he's running out of time, Dover loses faith in Detective Loki and has no choice but to take the situation into his own hands.  \n\tOverall, I felt the acting was impeccable.  Terrence Howard joins Jackman and Gyllenhaal as the father of the second missing girl and sheds different light on how one might react when faced with the same horrendous situation.  I was fairly engaged throughout the entire 155 minute movie.  Usually, I don't see a need for films like this to be quite as long, but in this case Villeneuve did an outstanding job of holding my attention and intrigue.  If there is one thing I could say about this movie that bothered me, it might be the ending.  Although it didn't ruin the film in any way, it did feel like a bit of a cop-out.  Without giving away too much, it definitely has a bit of a cliff-hanger ending.  \nThis film is not for the overly sensitive, weak stomached, or faint-of-heart.  It is the type of movie that leaves you truly contemplating how far you would go to save those that are most important to you.",

            "content": "Prisoners is one of the top five best if not the single greatest movie of 2013! And when considering that the academy of motion picture arts only nominated it for best cinematography, it is also one of the most underrated! Prisoners deserved at least half of the available nominations, including Hugh Jackman for Best Actor (his best performance yet I think), Jake Gyllenhaal and Terrance Howard for Best Supporting Actors, Melissa Leo and Viola Davis for Best Supporting Actresses, Denis Villeneuve for Best Director, Aaron Guzikowski for Best Original Screenplay, and of course, Best Cinematography for Roger Deakins. But the real star hear, besides Hugh Jackman of course, is Paul Dano. Paul delivered the most powerful performance in a movie filled with equally powerful actors and their own performances. I thought that if Prisoners was to be nominated for anything it would be for Paul Dano's disturbing portrayal as the mentally challenged suspect. \n\nThe more I sit and think about the nominating process for the Oscars, the more I come to realize that they are all a bunch of hypocritical old schoolers who relish in snubbing actors and directors and giving them to people who are far less deserving, I.e. Shakespeare in Love over Saving Private Ryan? Chicago over Gangs of New York? Forest Gump over Pulp Fiction? What Were They Thinking! That last one is a little unfair because Tom Hanks deserved that Oscar, but Pulp Fiction was clearly the better film. \n\nIf you have an ounce of respect for the art of cinema, or if you just love movies in general, you will do yourself a favor and see this movie. It is living proof that the academy of motion picture arts and sciences is one big joke! Another one to look at is Captain Phillips. Another great performance from another great actor, Tom Hanks, that was snubbed big time!",

While all actors do great in bringing the sentiment of anxiety and lack of safety to the viewer  the real surprise is the performance of Hugh Jackman. Probably one of the most likeable characters in modern cinema Jackman manages to come across as a torn human being, forced to do unspeakable acts of violence in order to save the ones he loves. \n  The movie simply absorbs you in its cold, complicated story, even though it can get a bit too loaded and too complicated to follow.  At the end of the mystery, when everything seems to be unwrapped and solved the last frames leave a continuous shiver down your spine and makes you feel genuine fear, and that is not a bad thing.",

A bit too aggressive though for a 'normal guy'.\n\nI had noooo idea Paul Dano was in this. He looked gross and creepy. I know him from The Girl Next Door and Little Miss Sunshine. After seeing this, I will say that he has acting range! Since LMS I've always thought he's one of the most underused and under appreciated actors. That's not to say that he's flawless with what he does, he's still got some work, but he's always consistent.\n\nIt was a movie that was very well put together (editing, scene transitions)\n\nNot to gloat, but at the 50 minute mark, I pieced it together. I was still curious how it would end, but I got the bigger part of the twist.\n\n***SPOILER ALERT***\nI defiantly did not enjoy watching a mentally disabled man get beaten and tortured. I think that was overkill.\n\nI think adding religion into the mix gives the directors an easy way out for the reasoning behind actions; this I'm not a fan of.\n\nI don't understand why the Keller's friends daughter (in the hospital after she was recovered), said that Keller was there.

            "content": "Director: Denis Villeneuve.\n\nWriter: Aaron Guzikowski.\n\nStaring: Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Viola Davis, Terrence Howard, Maria Bello, Melissa Leo and David Dastmalchian.\n\nRunning Time: 153 minutes.\n\nRating: R for Disturbing Violent Content including Torture, and Language throughout.\n\nLet's get this right out of the way for Prisoners: It is not a happy a movie. If you're expecting a good time or to come out with a smile on your face, this is not your type of movie. You would be much better off popping in something like Pacific Rim or seeing if Frozen is still playing where you live. But even if a film is horribly depressing, that doesn't mean you shouldn't watch it if given the chance. Far from it with something like Prisoners, the English language debut of Canadian director Denis Villeneuve (Incendies). While its grueling content and odd plot points may cause some contention with viewers, Prisoners delivers on damn near every cylinder you should expect to see in a good mystery: Excellent performances, a plot that keeps you guessing till the very end, haunting cinematography and some interesting debates on morality and what one would do and how far they would go to save a loved one.\n\nOne day, somewhere in Pennsylvania, a small get together with two families is going on. Set sometime around Thanksgiving, the two families The Dovers (Hugh Jackman playing Keller and Maria Bello playing Grace) and The Birches (Viola Davis playing Nacy and Terrence Howard playing Franklin) are having a nice get together. Everybody's laughing, chowing down tasty food, just having a good time together. The teens hang out while the youngsters, Anna Dover and Joy Birch, are off playing around in the neighborhood. \n\nA few hours latter, the two youngest disappear. An investigation is soon kicked into motion and headed by Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) to find out who it is Eventually, the find a suspect in the form of mentally handicapped Alex Jones (Paul Dano). But due to the fact there is a lack of evidence on whether he did it or not, he winds up being released. The father of one of the families, Keller Dover, however, becomes increasingly unstable over the course of the investigation, resorting to his own (brutal) methods to find out if Alex actually did it or not.\n\nSo yes, as one can tell from that synopsis up top, Prisoners isn't what one would call a \"feel good movie\". On top of that, it isn't one that goes by quick. It fully expects you to sit down and watch as it takes you on a long journey of what its like to have a child taken from you. Whether you have or haven't had kids, you feel steeped in the misery and horror of what the parents go through in the film. Hell, the film was originally slapped with an NC-17 rating before it got re-edited with a R. Frankly, after watching the film itself, it doesn't surprise me that it almost got the former.\n\nAnother interesting note to make is that in addition to being a Drama-Mystery-Thriller, the film is also a play on morality. Most of the characters never stay clean for long, especially High Jackman's character, who pulls some especially dickish things to find his kid. As seen in the trailers (don't worry; this all happens in the first half hour), he winds up kidnapping Alex to find out where the children are, but what he does will make your stomach churn. Even as the film went as on, I found myself conflicted with his character, wanting him to find his kids but I wished he'd stop being such an ass in trying to find his kid. The film itself and its characters are even asking themselves if what they're doing is justified or not.\n\nWhat I found interesting about the film is that you never really know who's who or what till the end. For the majority of the film's running time, it keeps you guessing on whether Alex did it or not. Is he playing stupid? Does he genuinely not know what happened to the kids? Was he manipulated into doing what he did? It's like being in a maze, a nightmarish labyrinth from where there is no escape from until the very end.\n\nThe film's performances are uniformly excellent, with Hugh Jackman showing us a scary side of his acting abilities that we haven't seen before. His character shows a broad range of anger, ruthlessness and regret. The performance as Dover is so good, it outright makes his iconic Wolverine role look downright pathetic by comparison. I can also safely say that thanks to this role, Jackman's was able to partially redeem himself after being in last year's blunderpiece Movie 43. He's not quite there yet, but I hold him in much higher regard than I did after 43. The rest of the supporting cast also give great performances as well. Jake Gyllenhaal continues to be one of the best actors working today, with an almost equally compelling side role as the determined Detective Loki. One scene in particular that stands out for me with him is when flips out in his office. I won't say what happens in regards to that part in what triggers him, but damn, he really lost it in a big way.\n\nTerrence Howard and Paul Dano bring their goods to the table as well, as does Maria Bello and Viola Davis. Melissa Leo also shows up as Alex Jones' mother, Holly, and while she doesn't have that many scenes in the film, she is compelling enough to keep an admirable presence on-screen. Even the kids who play Joy and Anna (Kyla Drew Simmons and Erin Gerasimovich, respectively) do their roles without some kind of saccharine or sickly-sweet kind of way that one would usually expect from kids in movies.\n\nShot by famous cinematographer Roger Deakins (Skyfall, No Country For Old Men, The Shawshank Redemption), Prisoners looks unsurprisingly beautiful in its imagery. Damn near every frame looks downright perfect, with scenes that look like they were molded by a paint brush than a camera. Denis and Deakins obviously know what they're doing, and I hope that they collaborate more in the future. Then there's the score by J\u00f3hann J\u00f3hannsson, who achieves haunting yet minimalist work that help establish the mood of the picture quite excellently.\n\nIf there were any problems I had with the film, I'd say it would be some plot elements. There's something that happens to Paul Dano's character in which he ends up disappearing from the public eye and it doesn't really get addressed until the last 30 minutes of the movie. Arguably, due to the investigation of the girls, I can see how their disappearance could be held in higher regard than Dano's but it was still a little something that bothered me.\n\nThen there's how the film handles its clues, foreshadowing and red-herrings, in which it maybe just a little too clever for its own good. It's great to see a film keep its audience guessing all the way through and then pull the rug under their feet when they least expect it, but it felt like the movie was getting a little overly complicated. Not that it was a major hindrance to the film's quality, but I can see how some would be fed up with the plot twists and the loopty loops the film pulls from time to time.\n\nIt's a shame that the film was missed at the Oscar season. It was a big contender in the first couple of weeks it came out but due to being swarmed by a mountain of other films (Gravity, 12 Years A Slave, The Wolf of Wall Street), it sadly got overlooked and wound up with only a nom for Best Cinematography. Yet, in spite of that, its more than worth checking out. Its imagery, performances and plot won't leave you for a while and it will keep you engaged all the way through its long running time.",

The movie - from Oscar-nominated Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois director Denis Villeneuve (Incendies [2010]) - earned critical praise upon its initial release in the fall of last year as did its large and respected ensemble cast.  Cast members Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal both had Oscar-talk circulating about them and the consensus on Jackman was that it was perhaps his best performance to date which was remarkable as the actor had just earned his first Oscar nomination the year prior for Les Mis\u00e9rables!  As I watched Prisoners, I found myself agreeing with much of the critical praise it had received and found it to be one of those rare acclaimed films that \"the masses\" (us!) and critics could both agree upon!  It is a gripping and engrossing, heavily dramatic psychological thriller about good guys and bad guys ... but mostly about those who inhabit the gray areas in between.  When two six-year-old girls of two married couples - Jackman/Maria Bello (The Cooler) and Viola Davis (Doubt)/Terrence Howard (Hustle & Flow) - go missing, all fingers point to the perversely pleased local simpleton Alex Jones(Paul Dano - 12 Years a Slave) whose cooperative aunt (Melissa Leo - Frozen River) believes him to be innocent although she knows he is a troubled soul.  When the local PD (Gyllenhaal) runs into dead-ends and Jones is released for lack of evidence, the desperate fathers do what desperate fathers will do to find their missing daughters.  Jackman becomes a self-righteous judge and jury via a frighteningly easy transformation but he still needs to find the girls.  The film asks tough and disturbing questions (with some ghastly images) an audience might not want to hear or consider and the film is a bit long (2.5 hours); but I believe it to be so morally confounding one cannot quit it.",

Prepare yourself for a very emotional, suspenseful, anxiety ridden maze-like trip through a parent's worst nightmare- this movie hits home hard for those of us with children but it's breathtaking raw emotion, keep-you-guessing type plot, and fantastic acting makes it well worth the heartache.\n\nThe acting is fantastic all around but Jake Gyllenhaal, Hugh Jackman, and Paul Dano steal the show! By the end of the movie, I was left especially hungry to learn more about Gyllenhaal's \"Detective Loki.\" The details of his character are incredibly interesting and fitting for his role. Jackman was intense... and I do mean INTENSE. His visceral desperation and anger are felt more than just seen. And Dano brings something to the screen that I have never before seen. We are told he is a mentally disadvantaged man with an intellect no greater than a ten year old and the way this plays out on screen is just brilliant. I'll leave it at that for this non-spoiler part of the review. The rest of the cast does very well also, particularly Terrence Howard and Viola Davis as Franklin and Nancy Birch though the movie does not center around their characters quite as much.\n\nThe cinematography was brilliant. There were some scenes that could easily have been movie posters, I won't spoil them for you. Overall the movie was beautifully shot.\n\nAs far as music and sound go, I have to say I don't remember any of the music from the film. This is not necessarily a bad thing as I would prefer it not be memorable in a bad way so as to distract from what is being portrayed but it also means that it wasn't amazing. The sound, however, is a different story. There were moments of complete silence in the movie where the silence itself was a sound effect. There were intense moments that were accented by incredibly clear and poignant sound that fit the scene.\n\nPlot, oh boy was there plot! A great, edge of the seat, thrilling plot that just smacked me in the face every couple of minutes! The movie goes on for about 2.5 hours and the whole time I was glued to the screen. What an incredible story!\n\n********WARNING: HUGE SPOILERS BELOW, don't read any further unless you have seen the movie or for some reason just want to destroy the experience of watching this film for yourself.\n*************************************************************************************************************************************\nOk, just so we are all on the same page, I am going to go through the plot and piece things together since there seems to be a bit of confusion on Who Bobby Taylor was, how joy escaped, and what the Leo's were actually doing to children.\n\nWe start off being introduced to Keller Dover and his son , Ralph. Keller recites the Lord's Prayer and his son lines up a shot for a deer. This scene is blatantly metaphorical for \"doing what is necessary\" in Keller's perspective. It also shows how Ralph is becoming a man. This plays well against Alex Jones because it shows you what Alex never had and why he isn't a \"man\" but rather still a 10 year old boy. (Obviously abuse and drugs/snake venom had something to do with it too). This is how Keller works, he doesn't enjoy killing the deer but it is necessary to him and the ends justify the means. The prayer shows us that he doesn't \"shoot the deer\" for his own enjoyment, it is a means by which he can get what he needs for his family. This foreshadows the exact sentiment felt when he tortures Alex.\n\nWe can now skip ahead to the children disappearing. We meet Detective Loki. He has tattoos but he hides them constantly. He clasps his hands to hide his knuckle tattoos and he buttons his shirt to the top button to hide his neck tattoos. He wears a masonic ring, His tattoos and his opening lines indicate that he has an interest in Zodiac signs and astrology- all information we are given throughout the film indicates that he had a rough past and was possibly a criminal turned cop. Loki is a prisoner of his past.\n\nKeller becomes a prisoner to his desperation, doing things he would never have done under normal circumstances, likewise his wife becomes a prisoner to her medication as a way of dealing with the tragedy of losing her daughter. Ralph becomes a prisoner of the house, his father the jailor. He is told to watch over his mother and stay home. Alex becomes Keller's prisoner in a very literal sense. The children are obviously prisoners- I could go on. Everyone in the movie is a prisoner to something by this point.\n\nThe RV is gone over CSI-Miami style and nothing is found- this is because Alex merely let the kids in, let them play and sing while he drove them to his \"aunt's\" house. This is what he meant when he said \"They didn't cry until I left them.\" It also explains Ms. Leo's later comment that he only played with the children. Loki continues tracking down leads by visiting local sex offenders and happens upon a body in the creepy as f*** basement/crawl-space/nightmare-dungeon under the Priest's house. This body is wearing a necklace with a circular maze etched on it, hmmmmm. It is also explained that the man has kidnapped and killed at least 16 children. This man is Ms. Leo's husband that she said disappeared after a fight. He is also the \"invisible man\" that the book in Bobby Taylor's house is about.\n\nSpeaking of Bobby Taylor, aka \"The Snake Guy,\" he was a former abductee, taken by the Leo's when he was just a boy. He escaped somehow, it isn't ever explained, but he is now damaged and seeks to recreate the efforts of his captors to try and understand their motives. He is obsessed with it, going as far as stealing abducted children's clothes, spattering them with pigs blood and claiming to have killed them. He buries child-manikins in his yard after bashing in their heads. He is a mixture of a victim with Stockholm syndrome, a child, and a copycat killer. He too, is a prisoner to his past, he even goes so far as to wear the same jacket as Ms. Leo does (more on that later).\n\nSo the Leo's have had a process that is now continued only by Ms. Leo since Mr. Leo is dead. By the end of the movie, we should be able to conclude that The Leo's had a son who died of cancer. They were religious prior to this and afterward, unable to reconcile the tragedy with their religion, they reject their religion and begin to \"wage war on god\" by abducting other people's children, creating \"demons\" aka the broken, parents of the abducted children. They do this alone at first and later by having Alex find and pick up children. The children are then delivered to the Leo's house where they are given Kool-Aid laced with ketamine and LCD and told that they can leave when they have solved a book fool of mazes. The catch is, the last maze, the same one that Mr. Leo wore around his neck, is unsolvable. Eventually the children are injected with snake venom and buried. This is exactly what happened to Joy and Anna but Joy was able to get away before she was injected. (Some might argue that there is a different order to it but this is the gist. All these things happen, it may be done in a different order depending on the kid)\n\nHow did Joy get away? The movie tells you but it is a bit difficult to piece it together. We see Joy's flash backs when she is in the hospital room and it shows a person wearing a jacket carrying Anna in the right arm and reaching for Joy (who is running away) with her left. It also shows two bottles of the laced Kool-Aid, one full and one half empty. We can deduce that it was Ms. Leo in the Jacket, and that Joy did not drink her Kool-Aid. This fits with what Ms. Leo said about having to move the girls inside after Detective Loki was snooping around the car outside. Thus when Ms. Leo was moving them inside, Joy ran away and was picked up by a passing motorist.\n\nAll this is pieced together when Keller visits Joy in the hospital and she says \"You were there. She put tape on our mouths!\" Keller thinks back and realizes the only place he has gone where there was a female suspect was the Leo's home. Joy must have heard his voice through the thin walls. He gains entry by half-heartedly pretending to offer assistance fixing up the house and ignores the obviously hidden weapon in her hand. This is the only part of the plot that made me cringe. We all knew she had a gun, and Keller should have too.\n\nSo he gets drugged, shot, and thrown in the pit- Loki finds Alex in Keller's old apartment building, in pretty bad shape assumingly. He is tasked with telling Ms. Leo they found Alex. Detective Loki lets himself in, finds Ms. Leo injecting Anna with venom and a firefight ensues, in which Loki gets grazed on the head and Ms. Leo gets gunned down. The scene where Loki drives Anna to the hospital was amazing. The lighting, the blurry eyes, the rain, the anxiety... MAN! PERFECT!\n\nThe end of the movie wraps up pretty neatly. Loki hears Keller blowing the whistle and we know that he finds Keller, and we know that Keller goes to Jail (based on previous comments made by Loki in the hospital).\n\nThis movie used the maze as a theme constantly. Think about how you would solve a maze on a piece of paper, following one trail until it dead ends and having to backtrack and pick a different branch, sometimes overlooking the right path until it is the only one left. That is how the plot played out, that is how each prisoner felt inside their prison. Beautiful.",

            "content": "\"Prisoners\" is totally messed up.  This shocking story of abduction, devastation, and brutal torture contains several mysteries that all tie together in the end.  Its content seems like it belongs in a late-summer thriller but it works well in this Oscar-caliber drama.  The script is well written, introducing important facts at all of the right times, making you think that you have it all figured out, and then keeping you (and all of the characters) guessing until the very end.  I found an internal battle forming within myself as I didn't want Paul Dano to be guilty but hoped that he was simply so that I wouldn't feel bad about him enduring all of that torture.  Dano is an underrated actor with impressive roles in \"Being Flynn,\" \"Little Miss Sunshine,\" and \"Ruby Sparks\" on his resume.  It may seem like he does not do much acting as Alex Jones but playing a role that communicates through body language instead of spoken dialogue requires a refined skill.  Hugh Jackman is good but sometimes it just felt like we needed a break from his overwhelming amount of anger.  The supporting roles are the most impressive as Maria Bello creates some nice emotional moments when the depression overwhelms her and she becomes dependant on pills to keep her numb.  Plus Terrence Howard and Viola Davis bring another dynamic to the torture scenes as they take on the \"good cop\" roles.  The real feature in this film is Melissa Leo, nearly unrecognizable as Holly Jones who progressively reveals layers of her life throughout the film.  You'll never see the end coming although you'll want to see the end of the torture arrive much earlier than it does.  There is something twisted about \"Prisons\" but that might be what makes the film so dreadfully attractive.",

            "content": "\u00a0There was a period in American filmmaking history where every movie looked great. All the shots were crisp and clear, the lighting was superb and every movie ,wether it was an idnie film or big blockbuster epic, looked high def. This was inbetween 2007-2011 and it was called The Deakins Period. \u00a0Roger Deakins is probably the most famous and influential cinematographer of our generation. Every single one of his movies are superbly photographed. Ever since No Country for Old Men he has created the most amazing looking movies of all time. From The Reader to True Grit to Skyfall all the way to the tiny indies like Doubt, Revolutionary Road and A Serious Man. If you just look at the trailers for these films then you'll understand the breathtaking shots this man produces.\u00a0\u00a0You could tell that after Deakins perfected the art of photography in No Country, every movie after that tried their best to look as good as a Deakins film. Some succeeded while others only touched the magic of this man's work. Soon enough every movie looked good enough to eat, but none of them could beat the beauty of a Deakins film. Every single shot of his is like a carefully crafted painting with strokes of lighting and camera movement perfection. Any director priviliged enough to work with him gets to have the best looking movie of that year. And that is exactly what Prisoners is. Yes, Prisoners of course looks amazing. All the shots were like big frames of candy for your brain to soak in. I could never take my eyes off the screen because of just how amazing every frame looked. It was so lush and clean. Hell, even a doorknob could reach the heights of the sexiest models on the planet. The dark shades and yellow hues made everything feel dark and gloomy, being exactly what\u00a0the film is. Prisoners is no fun family going film ride. Actually i suggest if you have kids then dont go at all because you will never want your little babies to be even a 10 foot radius away from you after experiencing this frightfully realistic motion picture.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0 Prisoners is about child abduction. Yes, that's what Prisoners is about. One of the worst subjects in society's history has a whole 2 and a half hour movie about it. It stars Hugh Jackman, Jake Gylenhall, Terence Winter, Paul Dano and Viola Davis. Prisoners chronicles the abduction of two regular middle class suburban little girls and how both the families cope with the situation and deal with it in their own way while a dedicated detective tries to find the girls before anything gets out of hand (And yes, trust me, things get out of hand very quickly). Prisoners is (almost) perfectly made. The mood of the films is meek and dreary, giving out a dreadful sense of worry the entire way through. It has moments of incredible suspense especially during the opening before the girls are kidnapped, A foreshadowing eeriness crawls through the first ten minutes or so and you're just waiting in horrible anticipation for the dreaded kidnapping moment to occur. As a hardcore drama thriller, Prisoner's tone keeps that definition the entire way through. It never veers into action or dark comedy because this subject matter is nothing to take lightly. It's completely serious \u00a0but not in a way where it's not entertaining. Its suspence keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting for what will happen next. The film never misses a beat and although the film drags on a bit, it keeps you anticipating for what will happen next, making the 150 minute runining time more bearable. This is all thanks to director Denis Villenueve's incredible skill in precisee camera work and setting up the correct mood.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0 Hugh Jackman deserved an Oscar nomination for Best Lead Actor because he just kills it in this movie. He plays a tough, fighting father who will do anything , I mean ANYTHING to find his kid. Jackman just takes over the film with his commanding presence. Jackman's brutally tough persona along with his rough figure shows that he's scary person in general even if he is a loving father. Jackman has quite a few emotional scenes throughout and he pulls off every single one of them with perfection and deep emotion. What makes Jackman's chracter so great is that we hate the things he does to people so he can find his kids, but we understand where he's coming from and sympathize with him even during his most immoral scenes. Thus making us question our own moral values and what we'd do in sitaution like this. Would we follow Jackman's harsh torterous \u00a0ways or would we follow Terrence Winter's character and do what's \"right\"instead of risking everything to find our kids. Terence Winter's performance \u00a0EXCEPTIONAL. He doesn't have a big role i n this film and that bothers me. We get ALOT of Jackman's POV during the entire film but we hardly get to see what Winter's chracter is thinking or what he does. We dont get his side of the story and what he experiences. There isn't an even ground between the two characters thus making a very one sided story. The rest of the film is about Detective Loki (hell yeah, LOKI) played by Jake Gylenhall. Detective Loki is the one that is actually doing the investigating into the two missing girls. He's very dedicated to his job making him determined to find these two girls. His character is extremely realistic in a sense that he's not finding all the answers very quickly. He finds clues and leads but most of them don't mean anything forcing him to start all over again. He becomes frustrated \u00a0and lost to where he almost starts a whole new investigation on a totally different suspect. But this also creates flaws in the story. Even I, as a viewer, knew who the kidnapper was and i fit the clues faster together than the characters in the story. That took me out of the film when i figured out that i was smarter than the detective himself which reminded me that this is a character not a real person that i should be invested in. Also, the film drags on in bits where it seems like they're just killing time so there can be more suspence. Yes, it builds itself up to an awesome climax but it seemed like it was deliberatley doing it and trying to force me to be in a suspenceful mood. If screenwriter Aaron Guzikowski \u00a0had just written a more faster paced film with substantially better character development and a less predictable story, then Prisoners might have been a perfect film. This is not an easywatch for anyone. There's torture, suicide and just a a bad mood oeverall. But these things add to the movie making it s bit more sharp and entertaining. Prisoners represents the immorality inside all of us. No one in the world is a perfectly good person, becuase the devil lurks in us all. Great acting, sharp direction and a amazing cinematography, Prisoners is a substantially great film.\u00a0\r\n\r\nRecomendation: Not an easy watch for anyone, Prisoners is a must see for people \u00a0with a tough heart but not necesarilly an intellegent mind.\u00a0",

However, I do have to commend Director Denis Villenueve's brilliant thriller about a desperate father's actions after his daughter is missing. Hugh Jackman delivers the best performance of his career as the Pennsylvania working-class father Keller Dover. On a Thanksgiving, Dover and his wife and two kids were celebrating the holiday at their best friends' home who are the Birches.; I guess those Sons of Birches could not just celebrate the holiday by themselves. Kidding! On that sad day, the Dovers' young daughter Anna and the Birches' young daughter Eve went missing; a mysterious RV parked in front of the Birches' home might have had something to do with it. When the driver of the RV named Alex Jones is arrested as a possible suspect, Kellen goes all \"cray cray\" in order for the police not to release him even though there is not suffice evidence to book Jones. Jake Gyllenhaal co-stars as Detective Loki, who is not the real \"loco\" in the picture, but does get obsessed to solve the case and find the missing girls. Villenueve's direction was superb and some might argue that he was sadly missing in the list of Oscar- nominated film directors for 2013. Aaron Guzilowski's screenplay was pure, even though \"Prisoners\" sometimes got locked up with some clich\u00e9s. It was great to see Jackman hide those big nails and singing voice, and transform himself into a character where he wore his emotions on his sleeve, and Hugh better believe that Jackman delivered the goods with his outstanding performance here. Gyllenhaal was also very good as Loki, as he continues his stellar acting career. Melissa Leo was stunning as the mysterious Aunt of Alex Jones; And speaking of Mr. Jones, Mr. Jones, Mr. Jones- Paul Dano delivered another effective cringe-worthy work as Alex Jones. Roger Deakins' cinematography of \"Prisoners\" was a scenic tour-de-force, even though I think that Deakins' \"arrested development\" of not getting the Oscars he deserves is a cinetragedy. OK, so I did write way too many pun-induced sentences for \"Prisoners\" after all; I guess that was a \"hard cell\" for you to believe I wouldn't. However, it is an easy sale for me to recommend the excellent \"Prisoners\". \n***** Excellent",

The man goes from zero to psychotic vigilante almost instantly, and boy does it hurt the film BAD. There is no chance to sympathize with him, no chance to understand his plight, no chance to connect with him. The difficult part is whether this is the script's fault or Jackman's. Jackman certainly doesn't help by going completely bonkers in the first 15 minutes and staying bonkers until the end. Then again, the script doesn't give much of a chance for a transition. He goes from pious guy to straight-up lunatic really rapidly.\n\nEveryone else is alright, though nobody really stands out. Still, better not drag it down than try to be a glory hog, I suppose. Deakins' cinematography, rightfully Oscar-nominated is astounding.\n\nThe film does overstay its welcome after a while, but it doesn't drag. It doesn't feel like a 2.5 hour film.",

The performances from Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal are the standouts as you'd expect, but everyone does a good job here. I enjoyed this movie not just for the strong narrative and characters, but the cinematography and attention to detail is amazing.

The mystery is very intruiging and kept me guessing into the end. You feel like you are watching a real situation unfold. The cinematography is perfect, the entire movie has a very dark tone with rain and snow everywhere. The shots are amazing, focusing on exactly what they should. It really is a masterpiece, even if it leaves you shocked. 90/100",

The movie itself looks great and builds tension very effectively. Ya you can figure out the bad guy pretty early on , but the movie is about more than just figuring out who took the girl.",

Terrance Howard was wasted whilst the ending unsurprising and poorly executed. There was some uncomfortable and carefully constructed moments which was great too watch.

One of the final scenes with Gyllenhaal(loki) racing to the hospital might be one of the most amazingly well-shot/directed scenes I've seen this millenia.

            "content": "Of all the films that have come out this year, Prisoners is by far one of the most underrated. It is one of the most unpleasant yet fascinating morality tale. It is not only one of the best films of the year, but one of the few films that went beyond my expectations. \r\n\r\nDuring one raining afternoon, two young girls are kidnapped, leaving the two families devastated. The two fathers, played by Hugh Jackman and Terrence Howard are dealing with the stress of their families when an seemingly obvious suspect, played by Paul Dano, seems to have gone missing. Though it turns out Jackman's character has kidnapped him in order to torture him for information. Meanwhile detective Loki, played by Jake Gyllenhaal, suspects there is much more to this case than meets the eye.\r\n\r\nLets start by talking about the best aspect of the film: the acting. This is by far one of the most well acted films of the year. Howard, Maria Bello, Viola Davis are all amazing and convincing in their roles, making the kidnapping scenario feel all the more real. Gyllenhaal is also pretty damn good playing the brilliant but flawed cop. But by the best performance in the entire film, that should have earned an Oscar nod, is Hugh Jackman. I've always been a fan of him, but this is one of his best roles. He always walks the fine line between sympathetic father and brutal extremist. It is much harder to find the balance between these two personalities, but Jackman is wonderful. \r\n\r\nWhile the story is a little straightforward and very reminiscent of Gone Baby Gone, I certainly loved the dark tone and moral and ethical questions raised in this film. How far would go to save your family? What if you're wrong? What if you killed an innocent man? These are some of the questions raised, but never fully answered, leaving it up to the audience to decide. That and how beautiful this movie is shot. For a film so dark, both thematically and visually, the cinematography is amazing. It was one of the few things the Academy got right this year by nominating it for Best Cinematography. \r\n\r\nIf I had one grip with the film, it is the twist. It is not bad by any means, and it is very shocking. But my problem is with the motivation of the villain. It feels a little cliched while the rest of the film was so realistic. That and some of the twists get a little too complicated. \r\n\r\nIt is still one of the best films of the year, though I would not recommend for everyone, especially for parents, given how dark and realistic it is. Still, the overall picture is worth a few flaws.\r\n\r\n***1/2 (out of 4)",

        {
            "content": "Produced by busy bee actor Mark Wahlberg and helmed by acclaimed Canadian director Denis Villeneuve, Prisoners is the type of vehicle that is perfect for fall movie going season. It was filmed in Georgia (which I believe, was made to look like a drab part of Pennsylvania), takes place during Thanksgiving, and harbors a non-stop sense of doom and gloom from its opening frame (I think the sun shined maybe once during the entire 2 and a half hour running time). Listen, I'm not going to sugarcoat it for you, this picture is long, feels long, and it really takes its time. Villeneuve uses old school filming techniques and doesn't project anything flashy at all. The story, when it's all said and done however, is somewhat conventional. Therefore, I think it was necessary for the events to be drawn out and dragged through the muck a little. Based on an initial viewing, I realized that Prisoners would have felt like a TV movie and/or a Law and Order episode if the running time was trimmed to say, an hour and a half. Thankfully, it comes off as an extended director's cut (I'm not the only critic that felt this way) and that to a fault, is what makes the flick work. Watching it, I was reminded of a David Fincher film (without Fincher's signature style though) and not just because it starred staggeringly disciplined actor Jake Gyllenhaal. Prisoners is basically a mild spawn of Fincher's Se7en and Zodiac. It's not quite as effectively creepy as those films, but it's definitely good enough to recommend.  \n\nPart kidnapping movie, part police detective character study, and part fatherly vigilante escapade, Prisoners tells the story of two families (neighbors from across the street) who get together on Thanksgiving day. The Birch's (Franklin Birch played by Terrence Howard and Nancy Birch played by Viola Davis who barely registers here) and the Dover's (Hugh Jackman and Maria Bello as Keller and Grace Dover) have a relaxing, calming holiday until their respective daughters wander off and go missing. This then gets the attention of a socially inept area detective (Mr. Loki played with vigor by Jake Gyllenhaal) who garners almost complete control over handling the missing person's case. As days go by and a potential suspect who might've taken the children gets bounced free, Jackman's angry, frustrated character eventually decides to take the law into his own hands. As the film slowly creeps toward its conclusion, you get small twists and turns (as well as slightly minimal character revelations). You also get to see how important drawing mazes are when it comes to character motivation (I've seen all kinds of thrillers and this plot point was a first for me). \n\nOn the acting front, one thing to notice when viewing Prisoners, is how it pushes aside the other performers in the main cast (Oscar nominees like Viola Davis and Terrence Howard) and puts its main focus on Jackman. Now I'm not saying that Hugh Jackman is a mediocre actor. I just don't think he has the fiery chops to take on such a serious, dramatic role. His fault lies in the extreme overacting and preening to the audience. He seems to be saying, \"hey look at me, I should be nominated for an Oscar!\" With all the focus on him, the other player's roles become seriously underdeveloped. It gets to the point where you hardly see them anymore. Using little of no background music, there are a lot of carefully set up scenes in Prisoners. To a fault, Jackman appears in almost all of them. Jake Gyllenhaal (Detective Loki), the only other actor receiving top billing, takes up almost as much of the shared time. The difference with Gyllenhaal is that he quietly out acts his co-star. His minutes on screen are underplayed but they feel more genuine, more studied (Gyllenhaal's character's facial ticks like eye blinking were a nice touch), and generally more effective. He seems born to play his role. Jackman on the other hand, has one persuasive agent (he probably needs to stick to his strengths which are the X-Men movies).  \n\nAs a fall release that feels as if it's a journey or a metaphoric expedition, Prisoners has a teaser of an ending that may leave viewers holding their hands in the air. The over length may also be a factor when it comes to their varied attention spans. I however, found this exercise mildly absorbing and it was able to keep me interested. You may find the opening ten minutes a little muddled and weak in terms of set up, but after that, this exercise will place you in its grip (not too tightly) and not let go. Like I said earlier, Prisoners makes its case for being serviceable because it rides the wave of other crime dramas filling the screen with gloomy, overcast, and rain-drenched sequences. While watching it, you can almost sense that it does hold back just a little. This film doesn't take too many risks and it may not haunt you like it should (Villeneuve's direction is overly careful). But hey, it still gets by though mainly because of said look and Gyllenhaal's icy magnitude. All in all, if you like crime thrillers that take their time and don't try to jerk you around with the camera, Prisoners might just set you \"free.\"",

The question, just how far is too far, and when does a bad choice for a good reason verge push an action over the edge of comprehension. Director Villeneuve utilizes a good cast (even if they might be overly categorized in their roles) to push these questions in to emotions for the viewer. And for most of the film it certainly works. It keeps pushing and pulling and twisting, and avoids taking any easy corners. The basic premise, the abduction of two daughters and the response of the families (with a particular focus on the fathers) is told in line with the detective who refuses to accept failure for an answer. The few gaps in the story are forgivable as the ride proves to be more than intense to keep you watching.",

But this movie went on for more than two hours and I didn't feel the time at all. The constant tension and the suspense makes it all seem very short. It was neither rushed nor prolonged. Just perfect. And of course, Jake Gyllenhaal and Hugh Jackman can't take all of the credit. Denis Villeneuve did such an astonishing job with the film. It's incredible.\nI give this movie a five.",

In the beginning minutes (which lead you into two and half hours) the story of raw emotion revealing a parent's worst nightmare: the disappearance of a child or in this case two families loss (neighbors.)  A strange camper parked earlier near the girls homes (they climb the vehicle's ladder and play around it until finally the older siblings remove them. So the RV and its occupant is quickly found as the driver crashes into a tree and escaping to elude arrest. This is where the film goes all wrong. What ensues is unspeakable violence by one of the parents after the \"suspect\" is released. The Father of one child (Hugh Jackman) jumps him in the police parking lot.  While Jackman is attacking the suspect he hears a disturbing statement which leads us down a very violent and tedious road. This film is horribly disturbing and violent, so much so you need to look away.  In the meantime the viewer is led in so many directions and twists (which seems intentional) that you feel as though you're witnessing a multi-car accident which the police are crippled to unravel.\n\nFrom a director that said he was \"surprised\" that the studio gave this film the green light is an indicator what you're in for and none of it is good. Three endings were shot and a test audience chose the worst. Jake Gyllenhaal is the detective who has never failed to solve an abduction crime and is sadly not convincing here. His age is veiled in tattoos and bad hair.\n\nWhere this ends of course will not be told here. This was like going to an amusement park with a huge anticipation of that great new ride and when you get off you walk away hugely disappointed wanting your money back.",

            "content": "Pray for the best, prepare for the worst. This is the philosophy by which Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman), a carpenter living in Pennsylvania, lives by. He tells his teenaged son that the most important lesson his father taught him was to be ready for anything, but nothing could have prepared him for what is about to happen.\n\nDover and his wife Grace (Maria Bello) are happily married with a teenaged son and a young daughter. The film opens with them going to eat Thanksgiving dinner at the home of their neighbors, Franklin and Nancy Birch (Terrence Howard and Viola Davis) and their two children of the same age as the Dover's kids. What starts out as a happy feast between the two families transforms into every parent's worst nightmare when the two young daughters ask if they can go to the Dovers' quickly. The children are allowed to leave, but they never return.\n\nAlex Jones (Paul Dano), who was driving an RV through the neighborhood around the same time the girls disappeared, is quickly apprehended and labeled the prime suspect. The problem is, Jones has the IQ of a ten-year-old, meaning there is no way he could successfully kidnap the girls and not leave a shred of evidence. So, he is released into the custody of his aunt (Melissa Leo) with orders to not leave the state. It doesn't come as a surprise that the parents, Keller in particular, are less than thrilled about this.\n\nHugh Jackman has delivered some good performances in the past, most notably as the superhero Wolverine, but this is by far the best performance of his career. As the film progresses, Keller slowly becomes the kind of demon that a religious man like him would condemn. Although he is a man that the audience should feel remorse for, his actions throughout the film make you consider losing faith in him, but they also make you think long and hard about what you would do if you were in the same situation as him.\n\nAt the opposite end of the spectrum is Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal), the lead detective on the case with a perfect arrest record and a determined look in his eyes. Unlike Keller, Loki doesn't have a personal life to speak of. Instead of celebrating Thanksgiving with family and friends, we see him eating his dinner in a diner and having a conversation with his waitress over the signs of the Chinese Zodiac on his placemat.\n\nThroughout the film, Keller and Loki butt heads every time they share the screen. Keller is determined to find his daughter by any means necessary. Loki is just as determined, but police scrutiny and his sound methods are leading the case in a direction that Keller doesn't agree with and there is nothing Loki can say or do that will convince him otherwise.\n\nThe performances in the film are all top notch. Jackman and Gyllenhaal both deliver the best performances of their careers, each worthy of award consideration. Bello, Howard, and Davis don't have as much screen time as you would expect considering they're the parents just as much as Keller is. Dano, who I never really have liked as an actor, gives a great performance, his character's clothing and just the general look on his face make him seem like a total creep. Leo also shines in a small, but pivotal role, and Wayne Duvall also does some fine work as the chief of police that is making Loki follow the evidence instead of his gut. The real stars here, however, are the people behind the camera. Canadian director Denis Villeneuve (Incendies) had not made an English language film prior to this, but his previous films have displayed his talents from behind the camera and they show again here. Screenwriter Aaron Guzikowski (Contraband) took a generic plot idea and turned it on its side with a script that keeps the audience guessing while incorporating some powerful religious-based overtones to the story. Icelandic composer J\u00f3hann J\u00f3hannsson's score is electrifying. And the cinematography is some of the best from the great Roger Deakins, who has ten Academy Award nominations dating back to 1991, it's that good.\n\nAs good a film as it is, Prisoners is not for everyone. Some of most pivotal scenes involve torture that might make you feel uneasy later on. The two-and-a-half hour running time and the slow pacing make the film drag on at certain points. With a little sharper editing, I think this film would have come out just as good, if not better, with a running time of about 20 minutes shorter, but the problem is that I can't think of any scene that would have been better of if left on the cutting room floor. That is my only issue with this movie, though. You will not forget Prisoners after you see it.\n\nFILM GRADE: A-",

Would you be willing to go against your morals? Many of these characters choose to do so, but Jackman seems to be the only one that doesn't feel much remorse. Speaking of him, Jackman and Gyllenhaal are outstanding, as is practically the entire ensemble cast, and the script lends itself well to the actors. The movie definitely had me guessing for a while, although I feel like most people in the audience will be able to figure out the culprit half an hour before the reveal. Still, Prisoners justifies its long running time with constant thrills and heartbreak, displaying a pedigree of film making that is very rare in most mysteries nowadays. It's bound to be buried under all the other Oscar contenders, but that doesn't change the fact that it's one of 2013's best films. And man, talk about a depressing ending.",

What starts off as a movie about a kidnapping then escalates into a maze of character development and wrong turns. This could have been HUGE flaw if it weren't for the actors. Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal do a tremendous job at keeping the film afloat. If they hadn't it would have made people sleepy and exhausted. The running time as well furthers the aggravation (which I guess is appropriate because it makes you feel for these two characters and the situation at hand). It's nearly 3 hours long and much of it is stretched over the character development of Jackman's character.\n\nKeller Dover is the type of man who is always ready for when a disaster is going to happen. He's one of those very cautious people who is already prepared for doomsday even before it happens. He's deeply religious too, married and has one son and one daughter. That is until one day on Thanksgiving, his daughter is suddenly taken from him. She and another daughter from a close friend of Keller's are kidnapped and this throws both families into emotional turmoil. Where are their children?\n\nDetective Loki is assigned to the case and his skepticism doesn't do both family any good. Loki, at first, isn't too concerned since he has no family of his own. So he can't exactly relate. What he is able to do is function as a detective in solving a crime. Even to the extreme. \n\nA suspect is found in Alex Jones who lives with Holly Jones (his aunt) for many years. Alex has the mental capacity of a 10 year old and it was his RV that was spotted outside Keller's home. Alex is the link to where the little girl's are and Keller knows this. When Alex is booked and questioned, evidence is immediately nowhere. A conviction isn't in the books and Alex is free to go. \n\nThis is where Keller goes from a good Christian family man into a man seeking answers in the name of vengeance.\n\nThis movie incorporates some brutal tactics. Torture is used as a device on Alex in getting him to talk and there's a level of pedophilia that is rampant in tone that adds to the dread. Director Denis Villeneuve does an amazing job with the atmosphere in this story. The fall/winter season, this film is set around, is captured perfectly and makes the film that much more interesting! Because if it were set in the Spring or Summer it wouldn't have been as interesting with all those sunny day shots in what is suppose to be a dreary story. These kinds of stories don't need the sun, they belong in the dark and cloudy.\n\nTwists and turns do generate a series of questions the viewer will have while watching it. That is unless you're clever enough to easily spot who it REALLY is.\n\nOverall, the performances and direction are the highlight in this overlong mystery.",

He always catches his man but this case is bigger than he thought and must find Dover daughter before the case goes cold. \n\nThis is one of the best movies of 2013. No other movie this year made me feel so nervous. This movie made me  have that same uneasy feeling I did the first time saw No Country for Old Men. The film reminded me of Seven a bit just because of the dark subject matter and the cold atmosphere surrounding it. It has that same nasty grit that Seven had. \n\nNow, let's talking about performances. Hugh Jackman brought so much to this movie. He shows so much emotion in this movie and I've never seen him better. There are scene in this where he just loses all fate that he will never find his daughter and scenes where is truly ferocious. As of right now, he WILL win an Oscar for his performance in this. \n\nJake Gyllenhaal also brings something new. He has never played a role like this where he has to show a lot of anger and control. I just can't stress enough how good everyone is in this movie.",

            "content": "One more Hollywood recruiter of foreign talents, Canadian Villeneuve (from INCENDIES 2010) submits his Tinseltown debut with a dark drama about a child abduction, congregated by a swathe of bankable thespians and a virtuoso DP Roger Deakins, it was a considerable success both in box office and among critics, although its Oscar prospect will not likely pan out. \n\nPRISONERS conventionally chronicles the appalling case with thorough stoicism to supply enormous stretches to the key performers, Jackson and Gyllenhaal are the two leading players, one is a dogged father believes in his own judgment and is pressured to take extreme measures to fish out information of his missing daughter; another is an idiosyncratic cop has to probe into a sordid scenario while his own backstory remains veiled. Through all these years Gyllenhaal has honed up his screen personality substantially and his quirky foibles (the compulsive blinking here) make him more human while Jackman is a tad over-the-top with a more straightforward character development. \n\nBello, as the flip side of Jackson, her post-trauma symptom is being fully destroyed, cannot function anymore, a devastating mother is a piece of cake for her; Howard and Davis pair stand for a more neutral ethnic line here, which one can relate to oneself under the context, but their shortcomings are as glaring as they are ubiquitous. Dano, who takes us aback with another ambivalent career-turn, his make-up in the torture scenes is too surreal for general viewers, theoretically we should feel sympathetic for him, but somehow he manages to diminish this feeling with his look of opaqueness, is he a real retarded victim or a lackey enjoys the gore? It is a moot point where lingers great aftertaste. We cannot leave Melissa Leo behind here since she is the hidden culprit, her reasons for killing aside, her performance does enhance the story's credibility, and although her downfall is ordained, her encounter with Jackson in the ultimate confrontation is gold and only she can emotionally overpower and cramp Wolverine into his redemption into the darkness. \n\nVilleneuve proves wonderfully he is a dab hand can handle challenging projects like this, the whole production team is top-notch, Deakins' camera irradiates specifically in the car sequences near the end, alongside the cutthroat editing, a subdued iridescence can never be more ravishing and what's more praiseworthy is that it thrusts the narrative into its ultimacy with utter urgency and dazzlement. \n\nPRISONERS sits comfily into my top 10 year-list, PICTURE, DIRECTOR, LEADING ACTOR (2 spots), SUPPORTING ACTOR and SUPPORTING ACTRESS, for my no-gut-no-glory Oscar prediction, I sincerely hope Deakins can sneak in, alas, even so, he is no chance of winning over GRAVITY (2013, 9/10).",

            "content": "In 2011, Canadian director Denis Villeneuve's \"Incendies\" received an Oscar nomination for Best Foreign Language film. For that, he depicted a family that ventured on a journey of discovery. In \"Prisoners\", Villeneuve turns his eye to another bleak family drama where 'discovery' is, once again, the driving force behind his characters' motivations.\n\nAfter a thanksgiving meal, two young girls go missing. The fathers of the girls, Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) and Franklin Birch (Terrence Howard) refuse to accept the procedure of the police in their investigation and take it upon themselves to be very active in the manhunt. When the main suspect (Paul Dano) is released from custody,  Keller takes extreme measures in finding the answers to his daughters whereabouts.\n\nSet in a cold, working class, Northwestern town, the look and feel for \"Prisoners\" is established from the off-set. It's harsh and bleak environment is reflective of the characters that inhabit it and Villeneuve wastes no time in depicting it's grim tale of child abduction. In it's early stages and premise, both of the lead actors reminded me very much of two Sean Penn films: Jackman's tortured father resembled that of Penn's character in \"Mystic River\" and Gyllenhaal's doggedly determined police officer echoed the work of Jack Nicholson in Penn's marvellous directorial outing \"The Pledge\". Like these aforementioned films, \"Prisoners\" benefits from being anchored by these powerful leads. I'm not normally a fan of Jackman but the man cannot be faulted here, in his ferocious turn as a protective father, stricken helpless and with no control over his situation or grief. His furious and emotional outbursts are entirely believable and Gyllenhaal's subtle ticks and repressed display of a very similar character compliments the work of Jackman. On the outskirts, an impressive supporting cast are assembled in Paul Dano; Oscar winner Melissa Leo and Nominees Viola Davis and Terrence Howard, although the very talented likes of Davis and Howard are somewhat wasted in thankless roles that don't utilise their talents to the full.\n\nIn capturing the stark environment, cinematographer Roger Deakins delivers some sublime work. In a time of recession, this small town has little or no future and it's grim reality and sense of desperation and paranoia oozes from every pore. Villeneuve also cleverly plays with time; the town has come to a standstill during the investigation and even though every day counts for the grief stricken families, time seems laborious and torturous. The twists and turns of events unfold at their own pace making this, for the most part, a very tight and involving thriller. However, at two and half hours, the film is a little overlong with the final 30 minutes consisting of some tenuous and cliched plot developments and a few too many red herrings but these only stand out because the film is so strong up until then.\n\nA solid and unrelenting thriller that has some uncomfortable moments and an ever shifting moral compass. \"Prisoners\" is the perfect title in describing the entrapment - in one way or another - of each of the characters but when it comes to the audience, director Villeneuve doesn't take any.\n\nMark Walker",

            "content": "Powerful and completely absorbing, Prisoners is an emotionally exhausting criminal thriller, whose dreadful tonality and ethical questions asked are at least to be called disturbing. A haunting story with mesmerizing performances this movie is a gritty and intensive piece of film-making which in spite of being a bit overlong, constitutes Jean Villeneuve as one of the very interesting Canadian director exports to Hollywood.\n\nThe movie delves deeper into one of the biggest fears of parents: kidnapping and possible death of their young, beloved children. In a very straight-forward manner, director Denis Villeneuve throws the audience into a complex story which with the time turns into an ethical exploration and bold film-making. Franklin Rich (Terrence Howard) and Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman)'s daughters are kidnapped on Thanksgiving and it is Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) who is appointed the task of discovering them. Quickly, Keller decides that he should take things in his hands and challenges Loki's detective methods. By trying to find his daughter, Keller challenges the audience throughout the whole movie with the question: how far could he go; how far is ethically, morally acceptable. All these questions are at moments strengthen or weakened by the police procedures, the religious and emotional complexity of the whole movie.\n\nIt is true that Prisoners is much longer than necessary and that the pacing is not an example for a breath-taking criminal thriller.It is also true that the very experienced fans of the genre, with an eye for details, would probably solve the mystery towards the middle of the movie. Still,thanks to the wonderful performances of Gyllenhaal and Jackman, combined with Villeneuve's ability to stretch the emotions and to upset the audience ,this movie turns into a 140 minute challenge, which is worth-investing in.  Then after, the final credits, just like in his previous masterpiece, Incendies, Villeneuve lets the viewers confused and challenged both emotionally and philosophically.\n\nDespite the early-Oscar buzz, Prisoners will most probably fall short of earning Oscar nods or awards. Nevertheless, this movie is a wonderful opening of the Awards season and a must see for all types of moviegoers: from fans of the genre, to casual blockbuster viewers.",

Unlike his previous films which focus on the heights people will rise to in desperate situations, Prisoners focuses on the depths they will sink to at their most desperate. It's not an easy film, but it explores some big questions about right and wrong. It also boasts some spectacular performances, particularly Viola Davis as the mother of Joy, one of the abducted girls. She is, for my money, the best actress currently working in Hollywood and once again manages to steal the screen every time she is on it. \n\nPrisoners biggest weakness is in its under use of many of its actors. I know that to give them all parts as big as Jackman's and Jake Gyllenhaal would create an overly bloated film, but overall there is a feeling of an attempt at an ensemble piece, that was high jacked by the leads. It's not that Jackman and Gyllenhaal are not up to the task that's been given to them, but that the supporting cast have risen above and beyond and therefore overshadow them a bit. In addition to Davis, Paul Dano is wonderful as the suspected abductor in another role with very little dialogue and Melissa Leo is pitch perfect as his guardian. I want to see these peoples perspectives in addition to that of Keller Dover. \n\nThere is also an issue with the ending, with the motives behind the girls abduction left murky and unclear. This is a small gripe however as that is not what the film is about. It would have been nice to have a slightly shorter running time as well as it starts to drag and degrade into a cheap thriller with too much exposition in the final moments. \n\nOverall Prisoners is an interesting character study and it is nice to see a film that doesn't treat life as a Disney film.",

I think the heart of the film both lies in Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal who give the finest performances Ive ever seen from them. Roger Deakins who shot the film deserves an Oscar for his work as the town has this blue murky tint to it that just makes it that much scarier. On a side note Paul Dano is creepy as shit as a suspect but the real scary one is another suspect who is played by the actor from TDK who is the paranoid schizophrenia Joker helper. He has this face that just doesnt look human. This film needs to be used in screenwriting classes on how to build tension through a 2.5 hour run time.

What a cast! Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Viola Davis, Maria Bello, Melissa Leo, and Paul Dano  - for me the weakest point was Terrence Howard, but even his acting was satisfactory enough not to criticize it too much. \r\n\r\nBuilding up the plot was so natural and easy going that the later part focusing on the actual abduction of two young girls in Pennsylvania and the resulting search to find them, was a logical follow up with enough twists and smart clues to keep us all glued to the seats. \r\nExcellently developed character of Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman), a deeply religious man who runs a struggling carpentry business, from the beginning when he attends a Thanksgiving dinner with his family at the house of their neighbours, the Birches, was carrying most of the story \"on his shoulders\" with the help of  detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal). I enjoyed every second watching these two actors showing us the real master actors at work! Very powerful performances which could not be ignored. \r\n\r\nThe emotional complexity will take you from the first few minutes and you will sense a sense of dread that makes for absorbing viewing which could disturb some viewers.

The \"whodunnit\" aspect is handled really well with plenty of twists and turns and wondering whether people are innocent victims or defiant perpetrators.The cast is pretty strong although there's little focus on the other three parents which is a shame. There's also a lot of \"why didn't they just do that\" scenarios where the case should/could have been solved but the film does show the police aren't that effective - although I'd have thought a specialised team would have been called out.

            "content": "3.5/4.0\n\n\"Prisoners\" is a dark and very effective tale of disappearance of two young girls on Thanksgiving and the ensuing search led by Police Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal). When the prime suspect, introverted teenager (Paul Dano), is released, one of the fathersm Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) decides to take matters into his own hands in very gruesome fashion.\n\nThis is definitely one of the year's best acting ensembles with the cast also including Maria Bello as Jackman's wife who falls into deep depression and Terrence Howard and Viola Davis as the two other parents who Jackman's character tries to involve in his plans. Howard and Davis's couple are the opposite of Jackman-Bello with Howard the more vulnerable and Davis attempting to showcase strength. But it is Jackman who excels  in delivering another career-best performance after his exceptional, Oscar-nominated work last year in \"Les Miserables\" as a very tough and aggressive man who lets his fatherly instincts get the best of him. Melissa Leo is also exceptional in a brief role as Dano's aunt who raised him. Dano is also very good as the psychologically disturbed character. The movie's weak spot is Gyllenhaal but his acting is not at fault with the script mostly to blame for his character's lack of development. He embodies the character's obsession with the case (plus the occasional twitches) but other than that we know nothing about this key character. \n\nThe movie works well as both the story of a father and as a mystery. There are so many elements to the plot and multiple characters are introduced that all come full circle by the film's end that is very difficult to predict (despite my best efforts). There is not a single scene that is redundant, which is a testament to the film's great writing (kudos to screenwriter's Aaron Guzikowski, who only has 2012's mediocre \"Contraband\" to his credit, for this original story). Canadian director Denis Villeneuvue (who helmed 2011's Oscar nominated \"Incendies\") does an excellent job here in creating a very grim atmosphere throughout. This is by no means an easy movie-going experience - you will be attentive and at the edge of your seat throughout its 2hr30min running time.",

Absolutely outstanding script and performances. The casting and acting are amazing, especially Jake Gyllenhaal who gave a wonderful performance as the detective. Hugh Jackman also did a great work as Keller Dover. Atmosphere in the movie was over-the-top, similar to 'Se7en' and 'Zodiac'. I read one good comment for Prisoners and I tend to fully agree: \"things were slow sometimes but it only adds to the beauty of the big picture.\". I love the way this movie is made.

It was a very intense experience. It is hard not to compare this film to Mystic River or Gone Baby Gone because those two movies set the landmark for modern thrillers dealing with abduction. Prisoners almost lives up to the standards that those two films set. Canadian director, Denis Villeneuve, follows up his Oscar nominated film, Incendies, with this intense thriller that manages to capture the audiences attention once again. Incendies was one of my favorite films of 2011, and despite Prisoners not living up to the perfection that film achieved, I still thought this film was highly entertaining and satisfying. There were a few minor plot points that didn't work for me, but that didn't take anything away from this great film. It is a more mainstream film, but it manages to follow a similar approach as Fincher reminding us of Se7en or Zodiac thanks to its dark and haunting atmosphere. I am a huge fan of this genre and really had a fun time trying to solve the mystery through the small clues that Villeneuve masterfully presented in the story. Prisoners was without a doubt one of the most gripping and intense experiences I had all year. Unfortunately it is a little too intense and at times I felt the film could have used some moments to release such tension. Anyways Prisoners is a highly recommended film and a must-see. \n\nKeller Dover (Hugh Jackman) is a family man who is always prepared for the worst. He is a survivalist with a basement full of provisions and is teaching his older son, Ralph (Dylan Minnette), how to hunt. He's married to Grace (Maria Bello) and they have a daughter named Anna (Erin Gerasimovich). One afternoon, Keller's worst nightmare comes true while they are hanging out with their friendly neighbors the Birches. Franklin (Terrence Howard) and Nancy Birch (Viola Davis) have two kids about the same age as Ralph and Grace, Eliza (Zoe Borde) and Joy (Kyla Drew Simmons). While the two families are having a lovely time together, Joy and Anna decide to go back to Anna's house, but when the Dover's come back home they are horrified to discover that the kids never made it back. Ralph remembers that they were playing next to a strange RV that was parked up front which is now gone. Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) is appointed as the lead investigator in the case and the first thing he does is locate the RV. The driver is a disturbed young man named Alex Jones (Paul Dano) who has the IQ of a 10 year old and with no evidence to incriminate him Detective Loki has to let him free. His Aunt (Melissa Leo) comes to pick him up and explains how naive and innocent he is. As hours pass, Keller begins to get more desperate and convinced that Alex was involved he decides to take matters into his own hands. From here on the tension begins to escalate as they try to solve the mystery.\n\nPrisoners succeeds as a neo-noir thriller building up a lot of tension with a very dark atmosphere which is perfectly captured by cinematographer Roger Deakins. It adds to the mysterious mood of the story which on its own is already pretty intense. The screenplay, written be Aaron Guzikowski (Contraband), is very well written with a very interesting premise and some great twists. My only complaint with this film has to do with the lack of a strong female character. With such a strong cast, I thought that Maria Bello or Viola Davis could have been given a stronger role, but the film focuses mostly on Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal. They both give very strong and convincing performances, and Gyllenhaal has surprised me over the last three years with very good films (Source Code, End of Watch, and now this one). I guess he has been choosing his roles very wisely lately because his next film also looks interesting (Enemy which is also directed by Denis Villeneuve). Paul Dano also gave a strong performance as his character's motivations were very hard to decipher. The strong cast and the interesting story make this a very entertaining film despite some minor flaws involving character motivations. It is one of the best recent thrillers coming out of Hollywood and I doubt you will be disappointed.",

Dover tries his best to keep his imprisonment of Alex a secret.\r Two cases attract Loki's attention as he looks for the girls. The connection between them and the main case becomes apparent as the plot advances. A man runs from him during a candlelight vigil for the girls. He has a sketch made and hunts for him earnestly.\r There are a few red herrings and then a few Chekhov's guns. There are a few clues for those who keep a watchful eye. By the time the movie ends you feel sorry for some characters you might have been hating until that point. Unfortunately, not much can be revealed about that without risking to spoil the whole experience for the viewer. Prisoners is the sort of film that forces you to think about it for a while after you're done watching. There were a few puzzles I was still mulling over in my head and had to discuss with people to get their take on it. But rest assured that everything that is worth including is included in the theatrical edition.\r The two investigations eventually end up at the same place, and the ending is bittersweet. I think it was well done, contrary to what everyone else has been saying about it.\r Roger Deakins lives up to his name. Every scene was exquisitely shot. The film was well edited. At a running time of two hours and twenty six minutes, Prisoners is a fast paced drama that never relents and constantly surprises and amazes at every turn. The characters were well drawn. Hugh Jackman depicts the anguish of a grieving father with poignant scenes. Jake Gyllenhaal portrays the detective as a distinct, somewhat eccentric, and extremely dedicated man married to his job. I couldn't find any weaknesses in the script. The plot only progressed after making sure that everything that could be done to find the girls had been done. There were no imbecile moves made by anyone that contributed to the advancement of the story, except perhaps for one scene near the end, where Dover turns his back on someone he had reason not to. The tension and the sense of thrill was retained through the majority of the length of the film.\r It was an intelligent film made for an intelligent and vigilant audience, but the way it was shot and edited it also held the attention of those who don't have an attention span to boast of, so the element of urgency is perhaps what may have intrigued them and kept them awake.",

On my usual strut out of the theater I am asked how I liked the movie, and I give my usual answer \"eh, pretty good\" until my review getsYou don't have to be a parent to experience the fright that comes from watching the new film Prisoners. On my usual strut out of the theater I am asked how I liked the movie, and I give my usual answer \"eh, pretty good\" until my review gets posted and that person sees what I really thought. With Prisoners, I came out of the theater a little shaken, and as most people probably did, made sure everything was alright every time they heard a noise in their house that night.\rThe film stars Hugh Jackman as Keller Dover, but the true star is Detective Loki, played by Jake Gyllenhaal. Prisoners is the story of Hugh Jackman's family, and Terrence Howard's family, having a fun thanksgiving dinner. The parents stupidly agree and let their children play outside, and that\u2019s where we get the title Prisoners. The trailer is a little deceptive on how this scene plays out but ultimately ends up with the same idea that the kids were kidnapped by someone in an RV.\rThey find that Alex Jones (Paul Dano) was the driver, and that he basically has the IQ of a ten year old who speaks in this really high pitched mutter. As stupid as they think he is, he manages to quietly drop hints to Jackman that he has his child. Loki, a young detective, is assigned to the case and works mainly with Jackman to uncover what happened.\rThe movie takes some serious turns that make you share the emotions of the characters. Some of the minor cast members instantly become huge, and new characters are introduced on screen and join the flow of the movie easily. This single film had the best acting so far in 2013 with a very strong cast. Hugh was the parent that is willing to do anything for their child, which for a lot of parents was very relatable to. It's funny though because if he cared so much about his daughter, than he wouldn't have let her essentially run around unattended, in a creepy neighborhood in the first place.\rDespite the almost two and a half hour duration, I was almost off my seat on the floor the entire time waiting to hear the dialogue from every character. I cringed many times during the disturbing scenes (there were many), and they even managed to add in a couple jump scares. This is definitely not a movie to expect to half watch and whisper with friends in; because you will miss way too many details that you realize tie in later.\rEven after thinking deeply about Prisoners, I was left with too many plot holes, which led to a lot of unanswered questions, especially with the ending. It felt a little bit like Director Denis Villeneuve thought that it wasn't worth adding even more time to the film length to fill in some details, but it might have made the movie worth its longer time.\rThough most of the events in the film will probably not happen when you think about it, you are convinced during the film. There would be an unrealistic scene followed by a disturbing one, and you would be more focused on the suspense and disturbance, then the actual facts.\rDespite the negatives, Prisoners will entertain you whether it's through the edge of your seat thrill, or the relation to your own family. The film has already won two awards and has only been out nine days, and I won't be surprised to see it earn many more in the future.",

However, it is not a film I could recommend easily to others.  It is brutal and violent, and certain scenes are very hard to endure.

You've got a truly great story, an all-star cast, and a world renowned Director, making his American debut. Prisoners was considered to be an Oscar caliber film before itPrisoners is a prime example of why I will never understand Hollywood. You've got a truly great story, an all-star cast, and a world renowned Director, making his American debut. Prisoners was considered to be an Oscar caliber film before it was even released, yet for some reason they had to make it nearly three hours long. If there was enough story for a three hour film, then I'd be all for it, but Prisoners has a good 45 minutes worth of repetitiveness, that does nothing to help the movie, in fact, it takes something away from the film. The story begins on Thanksgiving, when two little girls go outside to play and disappear. Feeling that the police aren't doing enough to find the kids, one father (Hugh Jackman) decides to take matters into his own hands. Hugh Jackman stars in a role I wouldn't have imagined him playing in a million years. Based on his other roles and what I know about the man, this doesn't even seem like the kind of role he'd be interested in, but he gives one of the strongest performances I've seen all year, I really didn't know he had that in him. Jackman is paired by Jake Gyllenhaal, another guy who I couldn't see playing a tough as nails police detective, but he too surprised, giving a very strong performance. The cast isn't the problem and the story isn't the problem, what bothered me about this film was how much of it was unnecessary. Did we really need dozens of scenes with Jackman and Dano or all the talk and sadness amongst the families? This was a great all-around movie, but it was so long, that by the end, I'd stopped caring about what was happening and just wanted it to be over. Don't get me wrong, I highly recommend this film for a unique twist on classic story, great performances from an unlikely cast, and the work of a Director who his known around the world for his signature style, but just a word of caution. Prisoners is a very long film, that at many points seems to go around in circles. When they eventually do get to the point, it's outstanding, but it takes a while to get there.",

Contrary to popular opinion, I thought Gyllenhall and Jackman both overacted a bit. But the great performance of this one is Melissa Leo, who should be nominated (again) for an Academy Award. Totally convincing in her role. The plot is convoluted (though it does make sense, if only on reflection) and the pace is glacial, especially at the beginning. But it is a measure of how well directed the movie is that by the end you realise the pace is exactly right for the tone and the nature of the investigation at hand. There are multiple perspectives and revelations, some extremely fleeting, and while the movie is long and quite oppressive, there is also wonderful economy in the direction and script. A triumph.

There is no denying that Hugh Jackman is very good here but he is playing a rather dislike able character, even given the circumstances. His frequent rants tend to dissolve into monotone. Jake Gyllenhaal is much better as the cop. With his constant eye tics and suspicious nature he is the true heart of what makes prisoners ultimately as good as it is.

The deeply moving characters and its emotions are the movie's plus point and of course the great performance by the great actors as well. It is refreshing to see Hugh Jackman in a role the father to a missing child.\r A similar kinda movie to 'The Lovely Bones' where two young girls are go missing and their parent's never ending search for them begins. With a single clue they begin to dig every detail to bring back their children along with the help of a young cop. As expected character diversion had an important hand in mystify and confuse the viewers without falling for anything to conclude their prediction before it reveal itself.\r Fine photography. It was pleasant to see cool frames where there's no sun glare but always cloudy, shadow and dark atmosphere something like the movie 'The Awakening'. It brought real close to us the real grief of a family that we can almost feel it. Good or bad ending, the way it ends is all matters. In this story they give us an opportunity to take it either way as you want. One thing I was not convinced is the motivation for the abduction. The reason seemed to me a silly but in reality everything can be possible and sometimes it won't need reasons at all. Finally, it is a must not miss movie from the 2013 film calender.",

A thrilling,dark film that deals with the subject of child kidnapping. The movie has an incredible atmosphere, and Roger Deakin's gorgeous cinematography helps set a haunting,bleak mood that permeates throughout the entire film. Rain is always falling, snow covers the ground, and darkness covers everything. The characters involved go through hell, and you as the viewer are engaged every step of the way. This is the best performance I've seen from Hugh Jackman,no doubt about that. I haven't seen him give a performance like this since Darren Aronofsky's 2006 film \"The Fountain\". Jackman immerses himself into the role of the father who will do whatever it takes to find his missing daughter. The other performances are great as well, but it's Jackman's that really stands out. Prisoners is one of the best movies of 2013, but it does have a few problems. The biggest one is that the script leaves a lot of plot-holes and the final act is rather unsatisfying.It's not a big gripe of mine, but the movie does fall apart a bit in it's final minutes.

When a family man\u2019s daughter and her friend go missing; he takes matters into his own hands while the police methodically pursue multiple leads. It\u2019s a rather conventional story that just happens to be very well told, and never short on legitimately tense and shocking moments. But it should be noted that this is not just gripping thriller, it\u2019s also a dense drama. It\u2019s a drama so dense, that it easily came across as being too self serious; no thanks to those slightly excessive performances and the staggering runtime. In short, the film felt a bit overly dramatic. Hugh Jackman stands out as a devout father who, through his desperation, acts on tense misguided emotions to search for his missing daughter. However, Jake Gyllenhaal, while good, doesn't benefit as much from the subtle excesses of his character. He portrays a tattoo laden, eye twitching, heroic figure (in contrast to Jackman\u2019s anti-heroic turn), who carefully leads the investigation for the missing girls. Director, Denis Villeneuve directs his actors consistently, and excels at constructing the tension that lingers throughout this chilly film. Atmosphere is key when it comes to bleak thrillers such as this; and who better than, cinematographer, Roger Deakins to set the dreadful tone. His lenses which captures the grey days and pitch black nights, offset by the clear rain and white snow, adds nuance and a great degree pedigree to something that could have easily been a pedestrian project. \u2018Prisoners\u2019 looked great, and through its faults came some rewards; as the performance heavy approach and the solidity of its crime story kept me invested in the characters and truly engaged with the movie on a whole.

The trailer seems to give away all the secrets of the film upfront; it portrays the film as lacking depth, but in reality, it\u2019s just the trailer that misleads. There isDenis Villeneuve\u2019s Prisoners is way better than it looks in the trailer. The trailer seems to give away all the secrets of the film upfront; it portrays the film as lacking depth, but in reality, it\u2019s just the trailer that misleads. There is much more to Prisoners than one may anticipate.\r The film star\u2019s Hugh Jackman (surprise, surprise) as Keller Dover. Jackman is having an over-exposure problem at this moment in his career. As the actor seems to appear in every other film released these days, this creates questions that shouldn\u2019t exist like, \u201cWhat is the Wolverine doing in this movie Prisoners?\u201d Nonetheless Jackman delivers a solid, if not dimensional performance. His energy keeps the movie constantly driving forward.\r The film opens with two working class families getting together to celebrate Thanksgiving. Festivities abound, but while the responsible adults of the film have their attentions focused elsewhere, their two little girls run outside to play, unchaperoned. By the time the girls\u2019 absence is noticed, it\u2019s too late. The girls are gone. They have been taken. The major conflict of the film then is how to get the girls back alive.\r This job falls on Detective Loki, (Jake Gyllenhaal) but when Loki fails to produce results quickly enough, Keller Dover decides to take the search for the girls, and for civil justice, into his own hands. Performance-wise, Gyllenhaal as Loki is the highlight of the film. He maintains a subtle, calm composure, which contrasts Keller\u2019s (Jackman\u2019s) constant flying-off-the-rails. Loki shows a certain vulnerability while still being able to pull off fast-pace action sequences in an authentic, belivable way. He is very enjoyable to watch.\r The actual visual experience of Villeneuve\u2019s films is very important. His 2010 film Incendies made full use of wide and vast cinematography applied in exotic landscapes. This visual imagery captivated, but all the technique was there to serve the story, the plot developments, the characters. Incendies is a masterfully crafted tragedy and Villeneuve\u2019s commanding technique is evident too throughout Prisoners.\r Like Incendies the filters and tones that are applied to the film, as in the actual visual images on screen, are gloomy and sepia-toned. There\u2019s not a single sunny sky, a warm day, an orderly room. Sets are designed to feel dark and empty, the best scenes use sets that play with space, showing both the abundance of vacant space for some characters, while still emphasizing the feeling of enclosure felt by others. The use of light and dark, order and disorder, space, all things that cradle the actors performances, are created by Villeneuve, expertly.\r The suspense of the film continues all the way to the very end as Keller Dover\u2019s untamed compulsion to find the missing girls leads to a perfectly executed, nail biter of an ending.",

            "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nThe film opens with Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) hunting with his son Ralph (Dylan Minnette). He utters a prayer as the deer wanders into the audience's vision. They say amen and Ralph shoots the deer. They drive home in heavy rain, while Keller gives his son a lecture about being prepared in life. They then return to home and the family goes to their neighbours for Thanksgiving dinner. He we are introduced to the very well written characters such as Franklin Birch (Terrence Howard) and his wife Nancy (Viola Davis). Both Keller and Terrence have young daughters around the same age, and they go outside to play. Keller's daughter Anna (Erin Gerasimovich) asks her parents if she can go with Eliza (Zoe Soul), Terrence's daughter, back to her house to find her red whistle. But the family finds later she never asked her brother to come with her. They don't hear from the girls, and panic sets on.\rThe girls are declared missing and it is Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) who is put on the case. He finds a man who was near girls last known location and brings him in. His name is Alex (Paul Dano) but unfortunately isn't able to tell them much else. Without evidence he is released, but Keller is certain Alex took his daughter, and he won't stop until he can find his daughter by any means necessary.\rThe movie may be slow for people, but it takes its time to develop strong characters and creates a sense of realism from the performances. Hugh Jackman's character is so well done I was reminded of the desperate man performances of the past like James Stewart in Vertigo (1958) or Clint Eastwood in Unforgiven (1992). It's a very enduring character that I believe will be remembered fondly in the years to come. Another interesting performance is by Jake Gyllenhaal as Detective Loki. He's a Detective who cares about the case but is open to all possibilities as film goes on. Even his image with the slicked back hair and tattoos are rather different from the strong moral sense he exhibits.\rBut aside from the performances the cinematography stands out. The director of photography, Roger Deakins, uses slow zooms and out focus backgrounds with great editing to create a unique visual experience. Visually it compares to Deakins' other work like Skyfall (2012) and No Country for Old Men (2007). In the end Prisoners work on multiple levels and is a great film to see in theatres.",

This is shown through faith,'Two wrongs don't make a right' is a common phrase but with Prisoners we may have found an argument against its meaning. It raises the question of what is right and wrong when you are fighting to save a life. This is shown through faith, torture and upbringing with each character's personality questioning these themes. What is right? Who is wrong? And is it right to do wrong?\r On Thanksgiving the Dover family enjoy dinner at their old friend's house, the Birches. The enjoyment levels are at an all time high, for the only time in the film, until the youngest daughter from each family disappears. The parents begin to search frantically as the cops find the chief suspect in the RV that was parked up the road. This suspect has an IQ of a ten year old and the police believe they should look elsewhere but Keller Dover thinks otherwise and instead chooses his own methods of getting truth from the suspect. Will they find the girls and who will first?\r Starring Hugh Jackman as Keller Dover, Prisoners raises these intriguing issues by pitting the doting father against his daughter's potential kidnapper. As a parent you'd do anything to get those answers and in Dover's case this resorts to torture, imprisonment and fear. In opposition to that we have Jake Gyllenhaal's Detective Loki, an officer who relies on hard police work. These two may be aiming for a shared goal but ultimately they are each other's antagonist as they hunt for truth in very different ways. As an audience member it is up to you to decide which one is right.\r Villeneuve's direction and Guzikowski's script squeeze the themes to tears by covering each angle and every scene in opposing morality questions. At times these are deep but at others they feel forced, such as a priest who has killed a child killer to prevent him from continuing. This is here to be bleak, depressing and full of moral issues and it doesn't let up from that. Its pace is slow, the music dreary, the cinematography grey and wet, all adding to the tone of Villeneuve's piece. The script at times may feel 'on-the-nose' but it does raise these questions through it. Is it right to kill in order to prevent a killer, even if you are a priest?\r Added to the bleak tone are exceptional performances from Jackman and Gyllenhaal. Jackman portrays the grieving father with power and emotion leaving you unsure whether to route for him when he tortures the mentally confused suspect played by Paul Dano. At times his character is empathetic but at others he is frightening. This may become a problem if he was the hero to route for but instead during these scenes we promote Gyllenhaal's Loki to the forefront and it is his desperate search for the truth that we believe in. Gyllenhall also provides a wonderful performance as the Detective who suspects everyone until they are proven innocent. Both of these men can be seen as our protagonist but in reality neither of them are and instead the shared goal is what we route for. You may have a character you believe in but that all depends on which side of the fence you come down on.\r All in all Prisoners is a powerful movie, oozing in contemporary and moral issues. They are all prisoners in some way or another, even those fighting to put things right. At times the script laces these issues to the max, causing a few overly uncomfortable and expositional scenes but the gorgeous cinematography, towering performances and the cold atmosphere will have you leaving the theatre questioning what your move would be if you were ever in this position. This is not for the faint hearted and if you fancy a light popcorn entertainment film than Prisoners certainly isn't it.\r Rating: 4.5  5\r Directing: Villeneuve keeps the story's pace slow and adds more power from doing so.\r Acting: Strong performances from all involved with a star turn from Jackman.\r Script: A taut script that is let down slightly by nailing the themes too neatly.\r Cinematography: Deakins keeps it grey putting a shiver continually down the audience's spine.\r Score: Adds to the tone and engages you fully.\r Editing: Seamless. The slow pace remains constant and works.\r Overall: A thought provoking story that keeps you gripped throughout.",

Everyone did well but he stood out to me. Would love it if the director and Jake Gyllenhaal revisited this character again and made another movie I would def see it. On the other side, I hated the kids parents, specifically Hugh Jackmans character, and was really rooting for them to get whats coming to them in the end. (I wont say if they do or not). The other plot twist at the end was awesome also! Not quite sure where the priest  fit in after watching the whole movie but maybe I just will have to watch it again! Again, would love it if Gyllenhaal revisited this character! He really has become a great actor probably doesnt get enough recognition. Sorry I didnt see this sooner as it looks like it had been out for nearly 2 years already!",

The community all gathered and helped the two families search for their daughters. As the scenes unravel, you begin to question the probability of a fairy tale ending.\rThis heart stopping, twisted crime drama appeals to the young adult and older audience because of its use of language and violent scene content. The cast consists of Jake Gyllenhaal who plays Detective Loki, Paul Dano who plays the mentally disabled suspect Alex, Terrence Howard who plays the father of the Birch family, Viola Davis who starred in the \u201cThe Help\u201d plays the wife of Franklin Birch, and Maria Bello is the wife of Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman). When the investigation doesn\u2019t seem to be moving quickly enough, Dover decides to take matters into his own hands. The scenes that follow make you ask yourself, \u201cJust how far would I go to find my child?\u201d This incredible cast takes you on a journey of emotions: from fear, to anger, to horror, and finally drops you off at guilt.\rThis 153 minute movie takes its time to build you up and make you think you know exactly what is happening. Then it throws you off a cliff and says \u201cGotcha!\u201d\rPrisoners is one of the best films of the year! Four stars go to this stomach-wrenching film that captures every parent\u2019s most dreaded nightmare of losing their child.",

Hugh Jackman felt like a strange pick considering how many people would only associate him with the endless **** comic book movies that are still spraying out of Hollywoods anus, extremely average action movies, and that one movie Australia that literally no-one gives a **** about. Hugh was good though, he played the emotionally tormented dad who would do anything for his daughter, but he takes it to the point where he goes so far that everyone in the audience disconnected from the character completely and he enters the \"too **** up to sympathise\" zone which is usually reserved for the bad guy so their torturous demise can be justified, but the movie continues like hes a protagonist and everyone just runs with it because **** yeah we want to know who took his daughter.\r Jake Gyllenhaal does a great job of the obsessed gifted detective and his scenes are what make the movie interesting, but he's downplayed somewhat by the amount of screentime he shares and gives up for Jackman who spends it torturing a retard who somehow withstands serious amounts of **** which I felt was unrealistic or at least poorly explained, he says just enough to provoke Jackmans character and acts like he's intentionally enduring the torture for mysterious reasons, which are never really explored. The final scene is somewhat of a tease where a dramatic 3-way of characters with extremely strong motivation could have clashed but instead sort of just wrapped up without too much of a fuss.\r Still a great thriller that might be a bit uncomfortable for your girlfriend, but she'll be squeezing your hand real tight the whole time, absolutely worth a view.",

It explores the most grim aspects ofPrisoners is one of the most brutal, dark, hard-to-watch films you will ever see--not because of over-the-top gore or anything like that, but simply because of its themes and the way it portrays them. It explores the most grim aspects of human nature, showcasing the fact that everyone, if they're pushed far enough, is capable of becoming a villain in their own right. (The Joker would be proud.) And this showcase is executed almost flawlessly.The brilliantly realistic script and lifelike performances blend together in perfectly bleak harmony and create not just characters, but people that experience and react to loss beyond ordinary comprehension. It's rare that a scene of dialogue is so engrossing that it feels just as exciting as an action sequence, but that's exactly what Prisoners accomplishes. There's so much emotion and genuine humanity engrained within each performance and spoken word that I, as a viewer, felt just as terrified and helpless as the characters on screen. It's like its contagious, and it takes some serious talent to make art have that sort of effect.The editing and cinematography further add to the authenticity of the atmosphere. The camera is always positioned in such a way that the audience is always shown exactly what they need to see to feel the perfect amount of tension. It's beyond impressive.I really wish I could say that this movie is perfect, but it isn't. Where it falls flat is in its storytelling, which starts to collapse in the third act. When the true antagonist and their motives are revealed, it's all a bit farfetched, to say the least, and it unfortunately tears a hole in the otherwise very lifelike narrative. There are also some minor plot points that are introduced toward the conclusion that don't seem to be elaborated upon nearly as much as they should have been. But the final scene of the film perfectly ties everything else together, creating a seamless arc from start to finish.Prisoners is so close to deserving a perfect score. It wastes none of its 153 minutes and builds incredible tension and drama that never lets up. But that one unbelievable twist serves as its Achilles' heel and it just took me out of the story too much to forget about it.Story: 6Acting: 10Script: 10Visuals/Sound: 10Entertainment Value: 10OVERALL SCORE: 9.2/10",
