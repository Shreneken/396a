            "content": "The Last Exorcism Part II (2013) BOMB (out of 4) Shortly after the events in the first film, survivor Nell (Ashley Bell) tries to put her life back together as well as she can but she soon realizes that whatever was wrong with her is still there and coming back for more. THE LAST EXORCISM PART II is without question one of the worst horror films I've seen theatrically in a very long time. Year after year bad horror films are released but this here is at the very bottom of the barrel. After a quick look at the events in the previous film, we're introduced to an incredibly unscary pre-credit sequence, which pretty much tells you we're in for a dud. There's not a single thing that happens in this film that is scary. The majority of the attempted scares come from soft music playing before there's a loud bang with loud noises. This clich\u00e9 is just so boring and so tiresome that you wish people would stop using it. Director Ed Gass-Donnelly deserves a lot of the blame because there's just nothing interesting here. The visuals are all rather boring and predictable. There's not a bit of atmosphere to be found anywhere. For a horror movie the lack of scares is a major disappointment but what makes them even worse is that they're all so poorly staged and delivered. The screenplay also deserves a lot of blame. As with the first film, this one here has a lot of character development early on. We see Nell struggling to get on with her life. We see her at work cleaning hotel rooms. We see her fall for a boy and we see her and her girlfriends going for walks. After a while you start to wonder if the filmmakers forgot they were making a horror film. I don't mind character development but none of the characters here are all that interesting and this includes Nell. Not for a second did I care what happened to her and I certainly didn't care to find out the secrets behind the first film. The performances aren't too bad but did you really come here for that? THE LAST EXORCISM PART II is a really horrid sequel to a decent movie. It's funny but the first movie came to a close with a horrid ending and then this film pretty much picked up that horrid and carried it to a new level. And don't even get me started on the ending here.",

Its unnecessary, it doesn't accomplish anything and it doesn't push the story forward. All this film was made for was to show you how Nell tries to recover after the events of the first film. THATS IT! The scares are few and far between the story is just downright dumb from the beginning and you never really feel for any of the characters from the get go. I wouldn't recommend seeing this film even for the fans of the first one. Besides a daring opening sequence, a few moments of suspense and interesting character moments this movie is a complete fluke. The Last Exorcism accomplished a sense of true horror and dread. You actually felt for the characters. Part II I see more of as a Dark Comedy. You can't even take this movie seriously at times. It seems the only reason this sequel was made was because the first film made 100 million at the box office. Thats it! 3 out of 10 stars. This movie was just bad. Simple as that!",

            "content": "Before I start I must say I love the first movie, great story and acting. Normally I dislike the amateur camera story telling, but the camera shots were well handled and was only distorted when the theme calls for it which fuse well with the dramatic ending.I really don't believe this movie (the sequel) deserves all the negative reviews and here is why.From a technical perspective, I thought the cinematography was superb, lots of beautiful artistic shots adding to the mood of the movie. The build up of hopelessness and dread, it lays solid foundation to the climatic ending. I was expecting something similar to the last movie but the change was quite refreshing.In terms of acting, Ashley Bell did a terrific job as a terrorized girl with no one to trust and no where to turn. Granted the story is simple on the surface and shot with many of the \"jump from behind\" scene to startle the viewer. It may seem like \"god\" has forsaken Nil as she was chased by the demon throughout the film and finally the ones who was suppose to help her tries to kill her as they realize they are no match for the demon's power (clearly no one is looking out for Nil). The ending is non-traditional where Evil wins over good, but is the \"good\" deserving? (Girls watching YouTube videos to makes fun of Nil, the Order whom tries to kill Nil when they are frightened by the demon's power, the care taker is perhaps the only one none deserving of his fate)This type of ending is more frequent in Japanese horror where the dark force cannot be conquered by man and shows how small we are in nature. Perhaps the slight to our all controlling north American ego and an attack on \"God\" failing to step up as the mighty protector is the reason behind all the negative comments placed on this film.In summary I give a 8/10 rating to this film and looking forward to a final installment in the completion of a trilogy.",

Now living in home for girls she tries to forget the horrific events she experienced only to find out that they are all too real.This is a good sequel to the first in which the demons true intentions are revealed. It uses classic horror tactics and stays away from the traditional exorcism films. The plot was well grounded and the acting specially from Ashley Bell was outstanding. This was not filmed in the found footage style which adds more depth to the story. The ending to this film was definitely my favorite part and I enjoyed this good old fashioned horror flick.I was rather skeptical at first due to the low ratings on IMDb but I keep forgetting that horror films are not for everyone but if you do enjoy them this is a must see!! 7/10.",

            "content": ". . . as this is sort of a contradiction in terms, and unlike 1930s horror, it nearly always denotes a half-hearted attempt to warm up leftover effects, characters, and plot points from earlier movies. The scariest thing about THE LAST EXORCISM PART 2 is that the producers have been making the rounds threatening to release a LE Part 3, etc. Make no mistake: this does NOT have the potential to be a SAW franchise, or even FINAL DESTINATION. This sequel is even more a lame imitation of the hundreds of previous possessed-by-the-devil flicks than was the original. At least the first movie had some credible conflict in the characters of the pastor and the film-maker. The sequel simply tries to trot some of the dead characters from the first movie into the second in a muddled attempt to blur the line between illusion and reality. This simply succeeds in confusing the majority of viewers. Since the movie is PG13, there is not the necessary level of sex and violence to sustain a modern horror flick. The only thing that could salvage such a bad situation would be an original plot and good acting, but THE LAST EXORCISM PART 2 is sorely lacking on both scores.",

            "review_title": "A Nutshell Review: The Last Exorcism Part II",
            "content": "This sequel will go down as one of those that have gone horribly off tangent to its source material and original, which is a pity because the first film had a solid finale which left it as a cliffhanger of sorts, but this direct follow up junked every good thing about the movie in no less than 5 minutes into the film, and had everything go downhill after that. For writer- director Ed Gass-Donnelly, I'm sorry to say that while you have had good intentions and decided to forward the story without the use of the found-footage gimmick, I wonder why you didn't choose to be less derivative from classics such as Carrie and Firestarter.The first film worked because of a couple of reasons. First and foremost, it was a compelling premise, where a jaded pastor-conman decided to spill the beans in his profession, and herein lies the actual reason that it was found-footage because of an embedded documentary crew that followed him around while he exposed the secrets in his shady trade. Then there's proper character building, where we empathized with Cotton Marcus (Patrick Fabian), and understood why he decided to make good the wrongs in his life, and this worked into a tale of faith. Then the antagonist, spearheaded by Ashley Bell's wonderful portrayal as Nell, contained all ingredients necessary that blended horror and mystery together, plus her ability to contort herself in all angles imaginable. And who can forget that goosebumps raising finale.Not a lot of people took to that film of course, but it worked well for me. Then came Gass- Donnelly and his idea of continuing directly where the first film left off, was quite brilliant. Naturally there isn't any reason to pursue this in found footage again, so the major decision was to come up with a straight narrative film, following Nell as she ends up in a girls' home, since she did not bear any memories on what had happened in the final few moments of the first film. And here is where everything turned south as far as the story went. We get introduced to characters who were as flimsy as they were cardboard, and a romance that was totally flat from the get go. Yes we know that Nell is given every opportunity to assimilate back to normal society, but this was boring as hell when translated for the big screen, because there wasn't much emotions involved, and made it look very artificial, with scenes included because they just should. There were attempts to spook the audience, but even this relied on the tried and tested techniques which didn't offer anything new, especially when threats were issued usually through scratchy voices that may have come from imagination. To add further insult, there wasn't much of a \"last\" exorcism here, so the title was nothing more than to remotely link this film to the previous one, which had every reason to be \"last\", because well, that's what had happened. Here, while the exorcism performed was of a different style, it was so small a portion of screen time that it was quite negligible, especially its outcome.What made it worthwhile was went Gass-Donnelly shifted gears to add a sense of urgency into the narrative in the final act, and things were really looking up especially when we had Nell confront her inner demons, and pick a side to root for. But then the brakes got applied again when you suddenly realize that the director had gone the direction of films such as Carrie and Firestarter, both written by Stephen King, and you wonder whether that's all that Gass-Donnelly can do, to become nothing more than a derivative of those two works. This film could have been labeled as \"Nell\" and perhaps it may win over some thought that it's about the misadventures of a possessed character, rather than the process to get her exorcised for good. Rewatching the first film will give you better value, and thrills.",

The Last Exorcism Part II is a complete waste of time. It is NOTHING like other Exorcism movies, nor is even come lose to being scary. About all you get out of this is a lot of deep looking facial expressions by Ashley Bel who plays Nell. I was so disappointed in that there was nothing really scary, some possessed people who just talk scary, yet the demon is never really there. The scenes were so disjointed, and after 30 minutes, I felt like OK, this has gone so slow up until now, something really scary is going to happen next... I was mistaken. After 45 minutes, I waited, after an hour, I waited, then figuring that this was going to be a great and scary ending.. I waited.. Then the credits roll! ARE you freaking kidding me? This has to be the G rated version of scary movies of all time. Like another review hit on, the only reason it seems that this movie was made was to pry money from those that saw the first movie and thinking this will be a continuation of that. Here is the fact of life, if you go see this movie thinking it is a scary or demonic movie, the Joke will be on you as the movie maker laughs all the way to the bank.",

            "content": "Somehow the found footage genre still seems to be churning out films even though most of them are just bad. The Last Exorcism was one that worked pretty well as it made sense to the story and the overall film was executed pretty well, despite the lame ending. To no one's surprise the success of that film spawned a sequel that intelligently decided to move away from the found footage style and make it a normal movie that looks to be pretty cool, despite it's somewhat silly name.The Last Exorcism II follows Nell as she tries to build a new life after escaping the events of the original film, but when things seem to be going well the evil that once possessed her returns to take back its host. Much like the Blair Witch Project, Exorcism decided to go this other route with its sequel, but unlike it tried to keep the story intact. The story is perfect for the direction to keep this story moving, but sadly the film doesn't offer all that much. If not for Ashley Bell, reprising her role, this film would have fallen apart fast. She is so great in this role delivering all the emotional torment and innocence needed to make this character work. Beyond here there is really little going on in this movie other than her wandering around Louisiana. We all know that the formula of the possession films is the slow build, but when we already have an established story and character there is no need for it to be this slow. The few moments of \"haunting\" that you do get work well enough, but nothing like the powerful imagery of the first film that made it stand out so much.This is one of those sequels that wasn't needed but welcomed in hopes to make up for what they did with the silly ending of its predecessor. Make no mistake this isn't a horrible movie, it is actually still pretty entertaining on some levels, just doesn't push the limits like it should have. The ending proved to be a bit of an interesting direction to continue the series, but was just a bit too little too late to pack the punch it needed.",

Afterall \"Evil Dead\" had a sequel because the first one was rubbish and thats one of the best movies out there.. This isn't your typical possession film where you watch your generic 19 year old girl speak in a monotone demonic voice and you don't really care what happens to her because you've seen it a hundred time before. The girl in this you will actually feel sorry for, she is being taunted by the demon though everything thats actually good in her life and it's a shame, coupled with the fact she is a really good actress makes it a decent film, it tries to inspire emotion through flashbacks which is a really nice touch too. It will also become clear why it's called \"The Last Exorcism\" too! These negative reviews obviously come from people who had the whole script written in their heads before they pressed play, and it's a shame that their disappointment may affect others that just want to watch a movie and be surprised!

            "content": "'THE LAST EXORCISM PART II': Three Stars (Out of Five)Sequel to the 2010 supernatural horror film about a minister being followed by a documentary crew while he performs his last exorcism. This film takes place directly after the original and focuses on Nell Sweetzer, who was the girl being exorcised in the first film (and one of it's sole survivors). This installment is not filmed in the found footage format though and centers around Nell now living in a home for girls, while still possessed. The film was once again produced by indie horror master Eli Roth but it was directed and co-written this time (with Damien Chazelle) by Ed Gass-Donnelly (another indie filmmaker). The film is not nearly as inventive or fun as the original but it is a decent sequel and not nearly as bad as a lot of the reviews it's been getting. After a series of flashes from the first film, reminding us what mostly took place, we find Nell (once again played by Ashley Bell) sneaking into a couple's home late at night in New Orleans. She's catatonic and animalistic when the couple turns her over to a local hospital. She's then placed in a home for girls ran by Frank Merle (Muse Watson). She makes friends with the other girls staying there, lead by the mischievous Gwen (Julia Garner), and even garners the attention of a young man named Chris (Spencer Treat Clark, who was the kid in 'UNBREAKABLE' and also appeared in 'GLADIATOR' and 'MYSTIC RIVER' at about the same age). She gets a job at a local motel as well and everything seems to finally be going good for her but those annoying demons just won't let her alone and continue to harass her throughout the rest of the film. The movie is cheesy of course but it's supposed to be; it's a B horror film! It's much better than a lot of other crap out there that gets much better reviews (I personally found it a lot more entertaining than the 'PARANORMAL ACTIVITY' films). It's a bad movie but it's amusing and it's the type of flick most horror fans would say is 'so bad it's good'. It of course doesn't live up to the original but that had it's haters as well (I personally loved the original film). Bell is very good in the lead role once again and the directing is decent for this sort of film. The script is about what you'd expect from a movie called 'THE LAST EXORCISM PART II' as well. I saw the movie as part of a double feature (I created, at Regal's $5 movie night) with the youth gone wild party film '21 & OVER'. This wasn't as good as the latter but it was nostalgic and a lot of fun to see two 80s style teen movies (a B horror film and a youth sex/party flick). If nothing else it's at least good for that.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sH2nsN_uuBI",

It may have been a 'found footage' film, but it was enjoyably creepy, despite being an overused genre about an overused subject matter.Therefore, based on the first movie alone, I decided to watch the sequel. I really wish I hadn't. It's a completely different type of film for a start, i.e. not 'found footage.' I guess the film-makers wanted not to just do a rehash of the first movie and try something different. What they came up with was simply one of the more boring films ever made.We follow the girl from the first story, now trying to lead a normal life. But she can't. The spirit she fought before wants to be in her again. Things bump around wherever she goes, therefore, in turn, making her jump. That's about it. She has a gaggle of female friends who do little more than giggle and make clich\u00e9d remarks. Plus there's a love interest for out main lead. It adds nothing to the plot, other than detracting yet further from anything vaguely scary.The Last Exorcism (part one) was nothing that special, but at least it was watchable enough to be enjoyable (if you like low budget horror flicks). Part II, on the other hand, is just dull with no redeeming features.Maybe I should have known better than to watch a sequel to a film with the word 'last' in the title. Dear film-makers, PLEASE make part II the absolute last this time. I won't be watching 'The Last Last Last Exorcism' if it ever sees the light of day.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",

The plot advances constantly, though never in an unexpected direction. The New Orleans setting adds some atmosphere, and the movie is suspenseful rather than scary - most of the scares are of the loud noise variety.Overall, I thought it was better than the inaccurately named The Last Exorcism (it wasn't the last one at all, there was another one in this film).",

            "content": "\"The Last Exorcism Part II\" continues the story of Nell and the demon who wants her-Abalam. With a new director but the same actress as the first film, Ashley Bell. \"Part II\" is straight up horror story telling in a classic format. There is no documentary style footage present save the internet shot of the footage from the first film so the opportunity to really utilize basic but brilliant gimmicks for shock and thrills are very well in hand for this film. Which I think the director managed to use quite well without being too obvious or any real \"fail\" issue for the most part. The story has Nell moved to New Orleans and on her way to rehabilitation for a new start with new friends. However Abalam is not done with the young girl and there will be no salvation for her in the city.As far as the film's ability to bring the scares I have to say that the film did it's job. There were moments that normally would not have been scary nor interesting in the film but because the director utilized the trick of closed in frame shots, in most of the scenes, random moments became thrilling. The story is more focused and open to the viewer with no real hidden plot, which allows for more imagery and dogma that surround the whole possession culture. It allows for a more mystical icon-ism to play a big part in staging the story. It is a true classic horror story in all ways. That normally would seem like a bad thing but thankfully this director knew how to shoot the film and set up the moments that needed to be scary or exaggerated enough to make the movie work. Until the ending of course. That I have issue with. I appreciated the twist that says not every one gets a Hallmark moment but for me it came off cheesy and that boiled down to the use of CGI when more organic FX would have came off better for what the director was going for. \"The Last Exorcism Part II\" is a better story and movie than the first film but the first film had a way better ending. There must be a third film in the works because there where some elements of the over all story that were only vaguely highlighted and need to be unveiled in this character's grander story.",

            "content": "The Last Exorcism Part II (2013) Shortly after the events in the first film, survivor Nell tries to put her life back together as well as she can but she soon realizes that whatever was wrong with her is still there and coming back for more. this film is without question one of the worst horror films I've seen in a very long time. Year after year bad horror films are released but this here is at the very bottom of the barrel. After a quick look at the events in the previous film, we're introduced to an incredibly unsecured pure-credit sequence, which pretty much tells you we're in for a dud. There's not a single thing that happens in this film that is scary. The majority of the attempted scares come from soft music playing before there's a loud bang with loud noises. This clich\u00e9 is just so boring and so tiresome that you wish people would stop using it. Director Ed Gass- Donnelly deserves a lot of the blame because there's just nothing interesting here. The visuals are all rather boring and predictable. There's not a bit of atmosphere to be found anywhere. For a horror movie the lack of scares is a major disappointment but what makes them even worse is that they're all so poorly staged and delivered. The screenplay also deserves a lot of blame. As with the first film, this one here has a lot of character development early on. We see Nell struggling to get on with her life. We see her at work cleaning hotel rooms. We see her fall for a boy and we see her and her girlfriends going for walks. After a while you start to wonder if the filmmakers forgot they were making a horror film. I don't mind character development but none of the characters here are all that interesting and this includes Nell. Not for a second did I care what happened to her and I certainly didn't care to find out the secrets behind the first film. The performances aren't too bad but did you really come here for that? the film is a really horrid sequel to a decent movie. It's funny but the first movie came to a close with a horrid ending and then this film pretty much picked up that horrid and carried it to a new level. And don't even get me started on the ending here.1/5 StarsBmorecrafty-Bmorebloger",

She is an innocent, and still haunted by the demon Abalam. She gets a hotel housekeeping job, and even a boyfriend Chris. But she can't escape Abalam, and mysterious Cecile may be able to exorcise the demon once and for all.The original had the benefit of an indie realism. That is to say that it pretends to be real like 'Blair Witch Project'. It also had Ashley Bell bending over backwards in a (is she?)/(isn't she?) story. This one is much more traditional. Ashley Bell is quite effective as the naive Nell. The movie has a slow moving gentle feel. But when the time comes to pump up the scares, they pull all the punches. The kills are happening off screen. The traditional camera moves just aren't there. If Ashley Bell wasn't there, I would definitely fail this movie.",

Funny with some creepiness and a burst of disturbing at its unexpected if slightly hammy conclusion. The no. 1 thing I loved about that film was Cotton the Reverend, the second thing Nell played by Ashley Bell in a physically daunting, creepfest performance. So when I heard they were developing a sequel I was game Because the first film had created characters that I liked. But as the release loomed closer I realized that Cotton wasn't going to be part of the mix which was a little bit of a let down. However even though the trailer looked a little silly, well a lot I wanted to give the film makers props for not going with the know annoying found footage routine and updating out main characters story to something more classically cinematic. The results are mixed but it's safe to say that there's enough to merit a soft recommendation. The film picks up the moments after the events of the original where Nell is found traumatized and brought into a girl's halfway house. Everything seems well enough at first as she begins to adjust to everyday activities. It's a little lifetimeish as she listens to her first ipod, wears some lipstick and has her first real kiss but we like the character and Bell keeps it engaging. But strange things begin to happen and we slowly but surely discovering that the demon from the original is still looking for her to fulfill a prophecy of horrific proportions. It all sounds a little generic but the way in which the material is approached is somewhat interesting because you see the demon has in fact fallen in love with her and is sort of courting her destroying the life around her. It's a n intriguing concept sadly not fully explored but hidden inside this is great one and had they had more a budget to hide this hokey effects (cartoon cgi fire ugh), A more in depth screenplay and a harder rating which would have allowed them to show more this could have been a real blast. There is potential that runs throughout the film populated by solid performances especially for the genre, some decent scares, a creepy indie atmosphere and some really nice cinematography (the shadow work is impressive). But in the end it fails to really deliver on any of its promises which is sad and with its dismal box office and a feisty finale which could have led to something pretty cool it doesn't look like we are going to see another entry. Maybe we'll get lucky and they will explore the concept further on a direct to DVD sequel. But regardless of the films faults of which there are many it's a lot better than most of the big studio crap they've been releasing like The Possession and The Apparition at least there's a story here an an intriguing one at that. 3/5",

This happens because the movie studios are only concerned with selling tickets instead of making a good film. I also want to make it clear that Ashley Bell is an amazingly talented actress. The way she portrays her innocence and confusion regarding what has happened to her is soul shaking. She really makes you feel every emotion that she is feeling. That being said, it is not her job to make the entire movie scary all by herself! The first movie was so good and solid, so creative\u0085 This movie is just lazy, unoriginal and disappointing. A huge let down to fans of the first and I can only describe it as being slightly better than a made for TV movie. The only thing I thought was entertaining about this movie was Ashley Bell's awesome acting skills. Other than that, the story had no substance and when you finally get to the end, they treat it with kid gloves when they could have gone seriously terrifying. Huge disappointment. The only reason I give it a half decent rating is because Bell was so good.Please like me on Facebook!

I didn't mind the movie ended but story didn't really end! Yet another movie that show 95% of movie in trailer, Just watch the trailer skip this movie One other good think I can say about this movie is that the acting was really good from the cast but shame about the rest of the bland movie. 3 out of 10",

            "content": "\"The Last Exorcism Part 2\" doesn't conjure up half as many chills as its polished predecessor. Mind you, nobody performs an exorcism in this predictable but eerie PG-13 rated follow-up. Nothing here will afflict you with nightmares. Some of the surprises may catch you off-guard. Basically, this CBS Films release proves just as immaculate in its depiction of blood and gore. The throat slitting scene exemplifies the approach of less is more. Similarly, it substitutes physical contortions for violent outbursts. Mild would best describe the discretion with which everything is orchestrated. As sequels go, 'The Last Exorcism Part 2\" remains faithful to the original but doesn't surpass it. The second film picks up the narrative thread from the first and makes a slick segue. Ashley Bell reprises her role as Nell, while Lewis Herthum encores as her father. Otherwise, aside from the demonic spirit Abalam, the entire cast consists of newcomers.\"Small Town Murder Songs\" director Ed Gass-Donnelly co-scripted this edgy, 87-minute, paranormal horror chiller with Damien Chazelle. Occasionally, genuinely scary stuff occurs as in the first half of the film. More often than not, however, he resorts to a yapping canine, jangling telephones, or decibel-heavy musical cues that generate goose bumps. Red herrings are almost as stimulating as the genuine jolts in a fright flick. Often, the false alarms amount to pranks. \"The Last Exorcism\" appropriated the 'found footage' approach for this reason. If you've seen neither the recent \"Paranormal Activity\" franchise or long before it the 1999 ground-breaking \"The Blair Witch Project,\" you're acquainted with the 'found footage' technique. Nevertheless, like \"Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2,\" \"The Last Exorcism Part 2\" shuns the 'found footage' format. The filmmakers take a straightforward, chronological approach to their material. Consequently, the level of irony that enhanced the thematic value of the original is as conspicuously absent as any sense of humor. The Reverend Manley and his wife served as comic relief in the first film. Donnelly relocates the action primarily to New Orleans, and the ambiance of the Crescent City lends itself atmospherically to the supernatural shenanigans.Since the hypocritical Reverend Cotton Marcus perished in \"The Last Exorcism,\" Nell Sweetzer has to carry the burden of the plot in \"The Last Exorcism Part 2.\" The premise this time around is that our heroine must pick up the pieces of her life and begin her recovery. Nell scares a couple when she breaks into their house and they find her in a catatonic state in their kitchen. Afterward, she undergoes a battery of psychological tests and then moves into the Deveroux Halfway House in New Orleans before she can re-enter the world on her own. When she isn't suffering from 'bad dreams' in this psychiatric outpatient clinic with other girls, she lands a job on the outside as a motel maid. Those of you who skipped \"The Last Exorcism\" should know that Nell was the sacrificial virgin in the original. She delivered Abalam during a satanic ritual performed in the sticks of Ivanwood, Georgia after sundown. Reverend Marcus and his crew forfeited their lives during that frightening scene. Predictably, the demon stalks Nell every foot of the way because he wants to dominate her. At one point, Abalam possesses Chris (Spencer Treat Clark of \"The Last House on the Left\") with fatal results. Not surprisingly, Nell wants nothing to do with the Devil. She struggles to live her life in the present rather than lingering on the past. Frank Merle (Muse Watson of \"Hollywood Vampyr\") supervises the girls in the half-way house and he tries with little success to convince Nell that nothing about her predicament is supernatural. Despite her ambitious plans, she finds that her notorious past has reared up to challenge her after found footage from the original surfaces on the Internet and propels her into the spotlight. Whereas the first film pitted Christians\u2014albeit it bogus Christians\u2014against the Devil, \"Part 2\" replaces the Christians with Voodoo witchdoctors. Unfortunately, despite some shocks and surprises, Nell doesn't emerge as a strong protagonist compared with Cotton Marcus from the original. She survives her encounters with mortality at the hands of the voodoo disciples. The happy ending is disconcertingly consoling when everything should be nerve racking. Ashley Bell manages to convey vulnerability and tenacity in a subtle performance, but her character is so one-dimensional that she lacks charisma. Ultimately, \"The Last Exorcism Part 2\" does bend over backward to horrify but little about it is spine-tingling.",

            "content": "Hoping to move on with her life, a young woman finds that the demonic possession that had previously plagued her has returned and threatened to destroy more than what happened last time around, forcing her into a battle for her soul.This was quite an enjoyable and really entertaining effort that has a lot going for it. One of it's better efforts is the fact that this one really manages to work the demon possession as something to be feared and dealt with in this, as the amount of time spent here is where this one really works out nicely. Not only is this something that torments her as she tries to go about her daily life, it also shows signs of doing this in her personal life as the new job and life among the rest of the girls in the halfway house are certainly enough for this one to get some chilling moments in by managing to infuse numerous amounts of demonic whispers and flash visions that interrupt her attempts to move on which are quite nice at building this atmosphere of her being tormented and targeted quite well throughout here. Likewise, the personal relationships including her boyfriend and those around her manage to come under attack with a slew of scenes including her being psychologically assaulted and levitating in the middle of the room which is where this all scores rather nicely by throwing these sections together to effectively showcase the intent of the possession throughout here. That leads into the film's biggest plus, which is the rather enjoyable exorcism scene here. Rather than relying on the traditional Christian methodologies that have been done dozens of times over here, the novel approach of a voodoo ceremony to accomplish the same thing makes this seem a lot more creative and unique than it would be without the tactic which also results in this one making for some exciting action as well to really go all-out in this one. There's not a lot to dislike here, though they are pretty heavy as this one really has a problem wandering around in the beginning without really getting anything accomplished. The film has a problem with variety as this resorts to continuous use of whispers and voices for its scares yet doesn't do much else to really utilize its' scares so this one really tends to drag on in the first half with a long wait time to really get interesting in terms of pacing since it does the slow-burn build-up instead of the rapid-fire pacing that makes for a lot more enjoyable tactic. As well, the finale is quite lame and doesn't really do much to restore faith in it's decision-making as the weak look and rushed feel definitely impact this overall. Still, it's got enough to make for a decent-enough watch.Rated PG-13: Violence and Language.",

She pulls off confused, afraid, isolated, innocent and then smoothly transitions into downright menacing in the final act.

The pleasure comes from a gentle, slow-burn directing style that focuses much more on creating an atmosphere of dread than on jump scares or gore. As a result, TLE 2 feels in some ways like a 70s horror that lost its way and found itself in the new millennium. I suspect that's why it's got such an unfairly low score on IMDb so far - because it really isn't made for the low attention span crowd.In a nutshell, an average script elevated into a more solid movie because of some thoughtful direction and a brilliant performance by the lead. 6/10.",

The Pacing is Slow and the Exorcism Itself is Anything but Exciting or Scary.The Ending is Sequel Friendly and it does Work to the Benefit of the Character's Demon Possessed Persona. The Movie is just too Laid-Back and Stiff, Managing to be Only Mildly Successful. But Most of all it is going to be Disappointing for Fans of the Original and Horror/Supernatural Buffs.

            "content": "This sequel to the 2010 film fore-goes the 'found footage' style in favour of a more polished, straight-forward manner of continuing the story. Happily, Ashley Bell returns as the previously possessed Nell, found skulking, glassy-eyed and terrified following her earlier ordeal. She is placed in a psychiatric hospital, which carefully helps her to adjust to 'real life' where she gets a job, tentatively begins a relationship with a boy and makes friends with the others who live in the home for girls where she has been placed. But bad dreams, sinister nurses, imaginary (or otherwise) happenings and dreams of an increasingly dark sexual nature are never far away.It's a slow moving picture, which may explain why it didn't eclipse the success of the original. And yet the time is taken to really allow us to know Nell as a person, and sympathise every time her delicate nature is fractured either by supernatural events, or the betrayal of her friends: in a clever development, the 'found footage' from the previous film has been loaded onto YouTube, and through that medium the other girls from the home become familiar with Nell's.Ashley Bell is excellent throughout. She conveys Nell's scripted unease with the world beyond her sheltered home-life with touches of surprise, curiosity and anger at the new strangeness around her, never quite sure of the apparitions she sees are part of 'normality', or fragments of her imagination \u0085As well as this notoriety, Nell has also been observed for some time by The Order of the Right Hand, a group who promise to help her. Calder (David Jensen) and Jeffrey (E. Roger Mitchell), who run the group, conduct an exorcism but the demon Abalam is too strong, and they inject Nell with a lethal morphine dose (cure or kill, it seems). The demon appears to her as she dies, in the forms of people she knows, beseeching her too take their hand. When she does, Abalam finally possesses her fully and she sets about killing all those who have let her down. To show Nell is truly irredeemable by this point, she becomes a fan of that (inexplicable) modern horror staple, heavy metal \u2013 because clearly, all horror fans also love hard rock music (we don't)! Despite that last detail, this film is a thoroughly enjoyable sequel and a good story in its own right. Even if it had been more successful (it still turned in a $10 million profit, so it didn't fair badly), it is difficult to imagine how Nell's story could possibly continue.",

The acting from the cast members really isn't very good, the lead has moments where her performance is believable, but overall I felt like her performance was very lacking. Her performance, while not that great, was at least better than the the rest of the cast, I'm not sure if the cast just didn't have a lot to work with material wise or if they're just bad actors, but either way, I was very disappointed. The writing is very basic, it seemed pretty bare minimum. It's like the screenwriters wrote just what they had to for it to pass as a movie and then just left it at that. The effects are so so, really there is nothing at all to marvel at in the special effects department. I really wasn't impressed at all by anything throughout the entire movie. There were a couple scenes where I was kind of interested and wanting to know what would happen next, but ultimately, that just lead to disappointment. In the one or two interesting scenes, the scenes immediately following are huge let downs. I was hoping they would do something interesting and really original at the interesting parts, but they just resorted to old tired bad horror movie clich\u00e9s that most movie goers are very sick of.

They dropped the hand held camera and opted for better effects.Nell is at a half way house via a medical ward.

The plot was rather mundane for demonic possession films. The acting could have been better, but was par for a sequel. The movie opens with a quick, distorted, ineffective flashback that does nothing to help anyone who hasn't seen it.On the plus side of the film was the scare factor. It was able to effectively use sound, shadow, screams, background noises, and disappear/ reappear to create suspense and tense moments that would make most kids in a dark room go nuts. I liked the film for this reason, although I was not gaga about it. They at least did their homework. Now to bring it home with an effective script would be the next step.

Here is missing a story, there is no real main plot and this is the biggest flaw of the movie. The film also fails to try to scare us with the jokes provoked by sound effects. It irritates more than it scares. Blame the unfortunate and shameful Ed Gass-Donnelly, director of this misery, or Damien Chazelle, who wrote the script, probably, on a kitchen notepad.

Apparently the demon possessing her gives her massive orgasms in her sleep while her body elevates and arches above her bed in a display that would leave pornographers in envy. Julia Garner plays the standard brat out to make Bell's halfway house experience more embarrassing. Spencer Treat Clark plays that standard guy out to possess Bell sexually. Tarra Riggs is laughable as this spiritual woman out to exorcize her. Muse Watson has the laughable role of landlord of sorts for a home for girls. Perhaps these girls were locked away so that they could not flee the set. This is all visually well made and directed but very bloody stupid. It is just a money grab with no other reason to exist. This film is so bad that the only good it can do is to be tossed in a garbage disposal and possess that for a few minutes.

There is the odd moment here and there where you think \"finally - it's going somewhere!\" only to see that it comes to a dead end once again.Ashley Bell, while doing a decent job as Nell, didn't really play the part as good as she did in the 1st. There were too many moments where she jumped at different situations and looked like a rabbit caught in the headlights.

He wants Nell for himself and will stop at nothing to re-take her soul.How I thought a follow-up with the ridiculous title \"The Last Exorcism Part II\" would undo any of the damage done by the first film's pedestrian conclusion remains to be seen. It's my own fault for having ANY expectations going into this completely unnecessary sequel. To say there's no reason for this to exist would be foolish, as the box office take proves otherwise. Good or bad, it paid for itself and made enough money to justify its existence financially.There are a couple positive aspects I can talk about in regards to \"The Last Exorcism Part II.\" Ashley Bell's performance as demon-oppressed Nell Sweetzer is so captivating and heartfelt that it gives the movie an emotional depth it doesn't deserve. She's been rightfully compared to Sissy Spacek in \"Carrie.\" Bell is destined to shine in much better films in the future.The second thing that makes this movie easier to stomach than the first is its lack of shaky-cam cinematography. What you see on screen might be mediocre and dull, but at least your eyes can focus on it. You'll have no need for an airplane barf bag when watching this.Everything else found in \"The Last Exorcism Part II\" is recycled filler at best. We're supposed to believe the demon is in love with Nell. This is displayed in an awkward scene where she is levitated off her bed \"Exorcist\" style and then sexually manhandled by the invisible Abalam. All this is happening right next to her sleeping roommate.The physical embodiment of Abalam is laughable at best. Basically, it's a person in regular street clothing and hoodie wearing a mask for a masquerade ball. This is the best idea Co-writer Damien Chazelle and Director / Co-writer Ed Gass-Donnelly could come up with?Although the rest of the movie is nothing to get excited over, the climax and ending of the film is where it completely falls apart. Once again, a horror movie about demon possession finds the \"good guys\" seeking out a solution to the problem through other avenues besides the obvious. It's convenient that in every one of these movies there's never a priest or pastor around who truly has strong enough faith to exorcise the demon from the victim.This time, a secret organization known as the Order of the Right Hand who use Haitian voodoo rituals and the conjuring of Baron Samedi is called upon to lure the demon out of Nell's body. Use the powers of a Haitian Voodoo spirit known for disruption, obscenity, debauchery, and his love of tobacco and rum to battle a demon intent on possessing a girl? If it doesn't sound like this strategy makes a lot of sense, it's because it DOESN'T!Extra features for the DVD release of \"The Last Exorcism Part II\" are more entertaining than the movie itself. A featurette entitled \"Hair Salon Scare\" shows people getting groomed in front of a two-way mirror. The image of a freaky girl resembling Nell appears through the glass and scares the customers. The \"Shooting in New Orleans\" featurette will interest anyone wanting to watch Producer Eli Roth make a fool of himself by admitting he had any part in the making of this dreadful film.\"The Last Exorcism Part II\" is as senseless story wise as its name. It's a string of redundant horror movie clich\u00e9s only held together by Ashley Bell's wonderfully plausible and overly qualified acting. Count yourself blessed if you haven't already wasted your time watching this mess.",

The characters and their acting range from bland to....a lighter bland. Before the last ten minutes, it was pretty straight forward that Nell is batsh-t insane, there ain't no demons, came on. This is pretty much the things people in the real experience, and claim to be some possession BS. I honestly couldn't tell if any of the characters were good, they were all just so strange, I was suspicious of everyone. Really, I juts can't focus my thoughts, this film was so jumbled. There are so many pointless moments, like that guy commanding some light tree thing, right after Nell was having her...sex...dream thing. Or that statue guy during the parade. I don't know, this movie was overly sexual, numerous times throughout the film Nell listens in on people doing it, she dreams about it constantly, she looks like she wants some Gwen, she at the end she even licks her face. It's just stupid, maybe it symbolizes the fact she has to be the Devils baby mama, it's just dumb. It's time to talk about clich\u00e9s. First on the list, birds flying into the windows, that's three horror films in 2013 alone that have that happen, my god. Second, the static T.v., that plays mysterious video of Nell. I'm surprised there is no levitation or contorted movements, oh wait, you'd at least have to put some scary scenes in the film to do that. Yeah that right, not one, and I am dead serious when I say not one, single second of this movie tried to be scary. People having seizures, not scary. Creppy guys on demonic phones, not scary. There isn't even any of that stupid jump scare music, or any loud noises for that matter. Even the lowest budget, quarter ass-ed, garbage on Netflix tried harder than this. And yes, Nell looks like she's at least 30 in this film, even though she is only 17, they did even try to hide her aged face.And lastly, the ending. Nell switches over to the dark side, she magically UN-restrains her self from the table, and takes the imaginary devils hand. She really just grasped at the air. Oh, yeah this had a 30 second exorcism scene, YEP, 30 seconds, wow. Then they just gave up and pumped some poison into her, which was clearly a mistake in such a time sensitive moment. They should have just bashed her head, but no, the film wants to set itself up for a continuation. It ends with Nell becoming some type of X-men/Carrie wannabe.Now I remember why I didn't go to the theatres to see this, well it's still better that The Conjuring, whoops.",

Although the reason for my 5/10 rating was down to the ending! Yes, the ending! I found it hard to grasp weather they were killing Nell or helping her! It didn't add up! Plus she excepts being evil? Come again? Didn't like that whatsoever! Then she kills them goes back to her home & kills frank & the girls. Goes into Frank's truck & drives around while crash catch fire & blow up? That ruined the film! Big time! Just didn't cut it for me!I'd say the ending was the biggest let down here the rest of the film was good! I was hoping that the ending would be a case of Nell getting cleared of the demon possessing her moving on with her life then the film ending on a positive note! But no!

Joining the ranks of movies like REC and Troll Hunter, The Last Exorcism was another example of the strengths of using the mockumentary/found footage style popular in horror today. These films dictate that less can be more when conveying scares. The Last Exorcism Part II, however, is an example of how building on those successes with a bigger budget and wider platform does not equal automatic quality. In fact, The Last Exorcism II is just terrible. The story continues the tale of Nell, the subject of the doomed documentary of the first Last Exorcism. We last saw Nell held captive at some kind of satanic ritual before the film ended in grim fashion. In the follow up, time has fast forwarded some and Nell has not only somehow survived the events of The Last Exorcism, but she has escaped to the big city and been placed in a halfway house for troubled women. At first it seems like she may be able to move beyond her troubled past, until of course \"creepy\" events transpire that show things clearly aren't getting better.There really is nothing redeeming here at all. As the plot develops, viewers are treated to run of the mill scare tactics that were played out the last ten times they were copied in equally abysmal films. Any semblance of creativity that was present in the original Last Exorcism has been replaced with economy rate, cookie cutter filmmaking. The end result is so yawn and eye roll inducing that it could easily make my most disappointing sequel list of all time.",

I can almost see them between takes just a slurppin' away on their sugar-infused \"hand grenades.\" I'm not an African American or an apologist for anyone, but this movie drove me up the wall with its predictable stereotypes of black southern culture. Take for instance the use of, \"Good Lord, Chile\"???\u2014wooow, thanks for that nugget of brilliant and original screen writing. Why not just add a: \"uh, yessa Massa, I'll get you a new quill pen right away\u0085\" Or maybe a:\"Hey Absalom, have you seen my mint julep anywhere?\" And despite what the liberals in Lalaland, CA obviously think, not everyone that is a janitor or a caretaker in Louisiana is an African-American wearing a hairnet like the lunch lady. And I thought I might get lucky, but nope\u2014apparently horror movies \"in da' bayou\" require at least one pseudo-Voodoo hair cutting scene replete with the fedora wearing, slide-guitar playing black man belting out redemption songs like we're still running the Underground Railroad up to the Promised Land.

            "content": "\"The Last Exorcism: Part 2\" follows literally every single horror movie clich\u00e9 in the proverbial book. Of course, the movie has a scene of an evil priest spewing awfully written, cryptic dialogue about how the demon will win. Of course, while our somehow plain but incredibly attractive protagonist sits in a church, birds smash against the windows, killing themselves. Of course, there is a scene where our lovely, gorgeous (I am single) protagonist sits around a kitchen table with some mystic who tries to reach out to the spirits for help, and it goes wrong. Of course, there is a scene where our beautiful, 10/10 protagonist gets upset and her anger causes the person she's upset at to convulse, collapse, and die. Of course, there are talks of a prophecy. Of course, there are scenes of masked men eyeing up our protagonist from afar (but can you blame them?). Of course, there are dream sequences, there are scenes where someone magically floats up in the air while they are sleeping, there are scenes were our protagonist thinks she's crazy and other people are telling her to relax and that the demons and devils are all in her head, someone is at the other end of the street and they suddenly disappear whenever a car passes them by, stop me if you've seen literally all of this before, perhaps in the 1960s when these things were actually clever.God damn it, I'm really an easily amused person, and I fu*king love movies. I own thousands of movies, I've spent thousands of dollars on DVDs, nothing, and I mean nothing, is off limits for me to watch. I'll watch something with low scores and enjoy the hell out of it because of the sheer entertainment value, I'll watch something with high scores and find it pretentious and boring, but I'll still revisit it a second, a third, even a fourth time in order to pick it apart and see what I missed. For example, I gave \"Blade Runner 2049\" a low score, but I still bought it and watched it again to see if my opinion changed (it didn't). The point is I. Love. Movies. They keep me going. I'll watch anything, but horror movies especially are important to me because of the sheer amount of variety that can be displayed in them. So believe me when I tell you that I have never seen a lazier attempt at a \"horror\" movie then this, and this is coming from someone who absolutely adores \"The Last Exorcism\" part 1.I've read the directors AMA on Reddit, and he seems proud of this film. Good for him, I mean it, because that guy is making movies and I'm not. But for the love of God, why, why, why did he choose to throw in absolutely nothing original and nothing creative? It's like instead of thinking up something himself, he instead recently watched \"The Omen\" and decided to copy direct scenes from that film, and every other horror film ever made.Because of that, this film is so God damn boring. I'm a patient man, but I couldn't watch this movie in one sitting, I couldn't do it. I watched an hour and then went to bed because of how excruciating it was to watch, and then I finished up the remaining 30 minutes the next day, first getting plastered from chocolate liquor and whiskey to prepare myself because I'd be damned if I was going to watch the rest of this mess sober.When it comes to the chocolate liquor, I'm a 22 year old man who still lives with his mother so I had to make use of what was stocked in the cabinets. My mom enjoys mixing chocolate liquor with chocolate vodka, but I decided to not even mix the 2 and just to take shots of both separately. The liquor smelled and tasted exactly like chocolate syrup, and if that sounds gross to take shots of then you'd be right. The vodka was somehow harder to stomach. While it did smell like chocolate, it burned my insides up real good. Literally, just a sip made my chest burn, almost as if I was the one getting possessed and not Nell. Either way, after 3 shots of each I was sufficiently drunk enough to sit down and finish watching \"The Last Exorcism: Part 2.\"0/10No I'm just kidding, the movie isn't that bad, even though it is a generic piece of studio produced trash. I have to admit that the actress who plays Nell, Ashley Bell, is undoubtedly good, playing her with enough nuance and emotion that in a better film she may have even been nominated for an Oscar. Julia Garner is also a ton of fun to watch on screen, and she has the nicest hair I've ever seen on anybody, I mean good God she rocks that hair, she flexes nuts. Now, I may or may not still be drunk while writing this but think about what I just said. Ashley Bell, and Julia Garner, are the only good things about this movie. Their level of dedication to this film is admirable, and their care for the material and acting ability really does shine in this. Those two women are the only enjoyment you'll get out of this movie, and is the only reason this film is worth watching. That being said, I would never recommend this film to anyone, under any circumstance, ever.\"The Last Exorcism: Part 2\" is a colossal disappointment, and it doesn't even star Anne Hathaway. If you want to watch this movie, don't. I should've taken the advice of every other critic ever, because this movie was a battle to sit through, a battle I felt like I lost because instead if giving up, I decided to watch the entire movie. If you watch this, you'll be bored out of your mind and you'll find yourself praying to Abalam for sweet, sweet release. Come to think of it, maybe that was the intention all along...2/10",

Nell does not really have enough of anything about her as a character to justify a whole movie based around her quite simply. The story is nonsensical devil-in-my-daughter pointlessness culminating in an ending which invites more stupid sequels which are seemingly now inevitable.Utter stupid idiocy which actually makes me pity the makers of the Scary Movie franchise, perhaps it isn't their fault those movies suck so badly.

A sequel always has more potential if it tells the next chapter in a story, rather than repeating the same story again. THE LAST EXORCISM II does that, following Nell Sweetzer on her journey from the farm to the big city, and how the demons still haunt her and want to possess her permanently.Make no mistake about it, this is an Ashley Bell movie. Her amazing physical dexterity shown in the first movie is used again in this movie, along with a greater range of emotions than just sweet and innocent turning into demonic rage. And the vehicle that the script uses to further the attempt at her possession is a sexual one, rather than a violent one. Fortunately, the movie chooses to be suggestive rather than gratuitous, and could have easily fallen off the slippery slope of being too overtly sexual. What didn't work in expanding Nell's character in this way is that she is supposed to be 17, yet she and the other girls living in the halfway house all look to be in their mid 20's, far past the time when schoolgirl crushes and giggly behavior look plausible.The title of this movie is a bit misleading, as only a small portion of it is dedicated to exorcising her demons, and that section is too quickly glossed over. And the man leading the exorcism transitions from supremely confident to frightened and incapable as if his character's placement in the movie was an afterthought.The ending shows Nell overtaken by her demon, paving the way for a third installment, rather than proclaiming some sort of victory or redemption. Kind of a letdown, but not nearly as much as the ending of the first movie.",

After 20 or 30 minutes or so I just kept fast forwarding this movie little by little until the horror began. But there's no horror at all. Just Drama. And then I ask my friend who already watch this movie and they agree with me. It's just Bad. The maker of this movie just ruin all the greatest horror movie from the first one.",

While the first The Last Exorcism did the part quite well, in making me sense the dread and the horror, the sequel is an abomination of horror genre. No effects, no creepy atmosphere, no jump-out-of-your-skin moments, a lot of gaps and mistakes, nonsense throughout the movie. It took me two nights to finish it. The first night I sat there bewildered of what was happening on screen and thought \"Am I actually seeing this? Were they serious when they made this?\" and I had to close it and chose something else. And because I never leave a film unfinished, especially when I'm the one who picked it, two nights later, here I was, on my post, trying to get some meaning and purpose to this ridiculous sequel. Even the title is nonsense. They should've called the first one The Last Exorcism Part I but they weren't prepared for a continuation and when it got 100 million in the box office, they decided to just do it, since they've already gotten the cow. And I'm thinking their decision went like this: \"Hey, everybody is doing a sequel, let's do one too, right?. Think of how much money we could make? We'll call it The Last Exorcism II\u0085 No, wait, that's an oxymoron, we'll call it The Last Exorcism Part II, implying that the first was part one of a series. Think about it. They love sequels after sequels after sequels.\". Oxymoron or no oxymoron, they're still morons. The entire movie is nonsense. Whenever I thought that something was going to happen, which I believed it would've made sense and would've been logical, the entire plot takes a drastic turn. I bet when they wrote the script, they thought the audience could guess a possible outcome to a particular situation, so they changed the outcome\u0085 radically. Now, I always applaud unpredictability. I like the shock that I'm not always right when it comes to a character or a story. I like to be surprised and I appreciate the mind games. But in The Last Exorcism Part II, the script was an utter absurdity. The demon was hilarious. Seriously, it felt like a parody of Little Nicky (which is kind of a parody on its own). And the girl, Nell, was incredibly stupid and annoying. I was offended on behalf of Supernatural. I know the practice of salt as a protection against an evil spirit/demon isn't originated from the depths of the Supernatural writers's minds. Not even the black eyed demons. But Supernatural is the only show that uses these two elements at the same time. And guess what, now crappy sequels use them too. The Last Exorcism Part II(and I can't emphasize enough how much it annoys me this \"part II\") gets a big NO-NO from me. 1/10http://moodyclappers.wordpress.com/",

            "content": "\"The Last Exorcism Part II\" continues the story of Nell and the demon who wants her-Abalam. With a new director but the same actress as the first film, Ashley Bell. \"Part II\" is straight up horror story telling in a classic format. There is no documentary style footage present save the internet shot of the footage from the first film so the opportunity to really utilize basic but brilliant gimmicks for shock and thrills are very well in hand for this film. Which I think the director managed to use quite well without being too obvious or any real \"fail\" issue for the most part. The story has Nell moved to New Orleans and on her way to rehabilitation for a new start with new friends. However Abalam is not done with the young girl and there will be no salvation for her in the city.\n\nAs far as the film's ability to bring the scares I have to say that the film did it's job. There were moments that normally would not have been scary nor interesting in the film but because the director utilized the trick of closed in frame shots, in most of the scenes, random moments became thrilling. The story is more focused and open to the viewer with no real hidden plot, which allows for more imagery and dogma that surround the whole possession culture. It allows for a more mystical icon-ism to play a big part in staging the story. It is a true classic horror story in all ways. That normally would seem like a bad thing but thankfully this director knew how to shoot the film and set up the moments that needed to be scary or exaggerated enough to make the movie work. Until the ending of course. That I have issue with. I appreciated the twist that says not every one gets a Hallmark moment but for me it came off cheesy and that boiled down to the use of CGI when more organic FX would have came off better for what the director was going for. \"The Last Exorcism Part II\" is a better story and movie than the first film but the first film had a way better ending. There must be a third film in the works because there where some elements of the over all story that were only vaguely highlighted and need to be unveiled in this character's grander story.",

For viewers she is a hook to the film and a reason to invest ourselves so personally in whatever fragmented plot this film tries to assemble. For the most part this film is extremely captivating. It seems more concise than its predecessor and shies away from the found footage angle, although making it less realistic than the original, it makes us more receptive to what the movie is trying to achieve, which is sadly not all that significant. Despite having several tension filled scenes, they don't really lead anywhere due to the film's employment of too many falsities. Flashbacks, dreams, and pre-action jump scares should be used as a foreboding for what is to come, instead of the movie's entire scare factor. The conclusion brought smiles, but such smiles were needed throughout the first hour as well. As far as demonic cinema goes you could probably do much worse, but you could definitely do better.

There's a couple of seriously great visuals. The opening sequence is quite a strong scene and setup (despite this though, it is promptly dropped all together). Ashley Bell in the leas role has proved herself a more than capable character actor, and the effects quality (while not great) has taken a step up since the previous instalment. \n\nAaaaand that's about every nice thing I can bring myself to say. Even before the mentions of salt lines and Croatoan I felt that it played out almost like an episode of Supernatural that's overly long and has intensely boring characters. Beyond links like this it still feels like an episode of a TV show. One that the events of which were initially meant to be crammed into the final five minutes of the penultimate episode for the season, but the show-runners realised that they were going to be an episode short for what they were commissioned to produce so the then had to stretch it out with fuller bullshit to make it into a full episode. Except that it's even worse, 'cause this isn't a twenty, thirty, forty or even fifty minute episode of something, it's a full hour and a half of crap, the previous \"episode\" of which we left behind three years ago.\n\nIt was offensive to devotees of the original (if any besides me exist, if not then at least to me). And it brought nothing off even remote interest to any potential newcomers. I can understand dropping the found footage format of the first film, that way lies Paranormal Activity, and avoiding any similarities with that stream of garbage is always a good plan. But beyond that, all change is bad change, and almost all events of the predecessor are unceremoniously cast aside.\n\nI kept looking at the time while watching this and thinking to myself, \"Wow it's a quarter of the way through and it's still just tension building\", then \"a third of the way through and it's still just tension building?\" then half, then two thirds, then so and so forth until I got to the stage where there was nine minutes left and I realised that it wasn't \"tension\" at all, it was just lazy disjointed events that Botko and Gurland seem to think constitutes an actual film. I am a huge fan of suspense. Huge. But this was not suspense I felt, it was boredom. The payoff for which was a couple of seconds of poorly shot but semi-cool lead up to a potential third film the series doesn't deserve.\n\nSo Part II? It was, truly awful. But it still in no way effects my opinion of the film this is a sequel to. The Last Exorcism, was, and remains a solid and original piece of cinema.\n\n22%\n\n-Gimly",

This sequel ditches the found footage style and takes on the conventional format and the results are hollow and disappointing. The atmosphere is sucked away like a vacuum as is character development, aside from Ashley Bell who is on fine form and her character Nell changes, and I like how she is integrated into society but there's no terror here at all. Shop worn shocks are all that this sequel has to offer, it's thoroughly generic. You know what to expect, weird phone-calls, people aren't acting themselves, people stare at Nell, it's all basic and predictable and it leads to boredom.

Let's start with the problems of this movie because there are so many it'll make you very angry if you ever get some minute interest of turning this movie on: Eli Roth, a somewhat well-known horror director (Hostel, Cabin Fever), drops the bomb like he was purposely trying to piss off any horror fan that exists. The opening scene, the BEST and only somewhat good part of the movie, continues on how the first left off with the camcorder.  AND THEN, the entire rest of the movie has zero to do with anything else from the first. It's like using the name of a known film and calling it a sequel (I've seen direct to DVD movies better then this) just to cash out because you want to make a quick buck although this movie made nothing. So, fail. Other then that, the movie is boring, boring, extremely boring, not scary in the slightest but the only part that kept me watching was Ashley Bell's acting and how funny it was to watch a movie trying to be scary!

Compared to its predecessor, it is not presented in a found footage format, and it is not as appealing to the audience, except the repeated excellent performance of Ashley Bell. The story doesn't help you get involved and most of the time raises more questions than it answers. Somehow, the ending was left open, and until then most of the movie was filled with horror clich\u00e9s with no motivation to go for real imaginative scares. \r\n\r\nSome parts were on the edge, but most of the time everything was familiar and there are no surprises - this part was not at all as ambitious as its predecetor.

            "content": "So ... The Last Exorcism wasn't really the LAST exorcism.  As of this film, it was actually the second-to-last exorcism; but I guess that wouldn't make for a very good title.  Part II is the actual last exorcism -- or so I am assuming -- because this sequel is so bad (like rancid, curdled milk bad) that I doubt this story is ever visited again.  It is a shame the makers of this decided to toy with the story and verite style of the original -- which was quite profitable a few years ago because of its micro-budget -- as the original had a few genuine chills and bits of terror as it recounted an exorcism-gone-bad of a young girl named Nell (Ashley Bell) who was possessed by a demonic spirit in rural Louisiana performed by a bumbling preacher in-over-his-head.  This story picks up immediately after the frightening final moments of the first -- it was rather Blair Witch-ish -- as Nell walks away unaware of who she is or what has just happened.  The girl is taken to a home for troubled girls in New Orleans where she hopes to get her life back on track.  A few of the fellow girls befriend her and she starts up a flirtation with a young boy (Spencer Treat Clark) whom she works with at a local motel.  Only ... Nell doesn't get to live peacefully or happily ever after because the demon wants to retake complete possession of her body.  The story becomes one jumbled mess of exorcism-horror-film clich\u00e9s complete with dive-bombing blackbirds, bodily contortions and voodoo mumbo-jumbo.  The acting here is atrocious and while Bell showed promise in the first film, her talents here are non-existent.  She actually made me want the girl to become possessed ... like faster.  If the film were going for comedy, I'd say this was mildly successful; but its intent is to be deadly serious and if flails.  As if the movie couldn't get much worse, we get the ending ... ugh ... real demonic possession is probably less sufferable.",

            "content": "Sony Pictures Home Entertainment has generously released \"The Last Exorcism Part II\" on Blu-ray and DVD for those smart enough to have avoided it in theaters, but brave (or stupid?) enough to give it a chance at home. I know it's too late for some. Hopefully, my review can still save thousands of others from making the same mistake I did.\n\nEli Roth's \"The Last Exorcism\" was a \"found footage\" movie I really wanted to like. Against my better judgment, I went to see it in the theater and weathered through the first 70 minutes fighting off motion sickness the entire time. I was pleased with it until it unraveled in the last 5 minutes into a disappointing blend of \"The Blair Witch Project\" and \"Rosemary's Baby.\"\n\n\"The Last Exorcism Part II\" picks up with Nell Sweetzer going to live in a girl's home after the tragic events of the first movie. Things seem to be going well as she settles in to her new life by making friends, getting a job, and experiencing her first romantic relationship. Unfortunately, the demon Abalam has followed her to New Orleans and is jealous of her newfound friends and love life. He wants Nell for himself and will stop at nothing to re-take her soul.\n\nHow I thought a follow-up with the ridiculous title \"The Last Exorcism Part II\" would undo any of the damage done by the first film's pedestrian conclusion remains to be seen. It's my own fault for having ANY expectations going into this completely unnecessary sequel. To say there's no reason for this to exist would be foolish, as the box office take proves otherwise. Good or bad, it paid for itself and made enough money to justify its existence financially.\n\nThere are a couple positive aspects I can talk about in regards to \"The Last Exorcism Part II.\" Ashley Bell's performance as demon-oppressed Nell Sweetzer is so captivating and heartfelt that it gives the movie an emotional depth it doesn't deserve. She's been rightfully compared to Sissy Spacek in \"Carrie.\" Bell is destined to shine in much better films in the future.\n\nThe second thing that makes this movie easier to stomach than the first is its lack of shaky-cam cinematography. What you see on screen might be mediocre and dull, but at least your eyes can focus on it. You'll have no need for an airplane barf bag when watching this.\n\nEverything else found in \"The Last Exorcism Part II\" is recycled filler at best. We're supposed to believe the demon is in love with Nell. This is displayed in an awkward scene where she is levitated off her bed \"Exorcist\" style and then sexually manhandled by the invisible Abalam. All this is happening right next to her sleeping roommate.\n\nThe physical embodiment of Abalam is laughable at best. Basically, it's a person in regular street clothing and hoodie wearing a mask for a masquerade ball. This is the best idea Co-writer Damien Chazelle and Director / Co-writer Ed Gass-Donnelly could come up with?\n\nAlthough the rest of the movie is nothing to get excited over, the climax and ending of the film is where it completely falls apart. Once again, a horror movie about demon possession finds the \"good guys\" seeking out a solution to the problem through other avenues besides the obvious. It's convenient that in every one of these movies there's never a priest or pastor around who truly has strong enough faith to exorcise the demon from the victim.\n\nThis time, a secret organization known as the Order of the Right Hand who use Haitian voodoo rituals and the conjuring of Baron Samedi is called upon to lure the demon out of Nell's body. Use the powers of a Haitian Voodoo spirit known for disruption, obscenity, debauchery, and his love of tobacco and rum to battle a demon intent on possessing a girl? If it doesn't sound like this strategy makes a lot of sense, it's because it DOESN'T!\n\nExtra features for the DVD release of \"The Last Exorcism Part II\" are more entertaining than the movie itself. A featurette entitled \"Hair Salon Scare\" shows people getting groomed in front of a two-way mirror. The image of a freaky girl resembling Nell appears through the glass and scares the customers. The \"Shooting in New Orleans\" featurette will interest anyone wanting to watch Producer Eli Roth make a fool of himself by admitting he had any part in the making of this dreadful film.\n\n\"The Last Exorcism Part II\" is as senseless story wise as its name. It's a string of redundant horror movie clich\u00e9s only held together by Ashley Bell's wonderfully plausible and overly qualified acting. Count yourself blessed if you haven't already wasted your time watching this mess. \n\nhttp://contributor.yahoo.com/user/849014/eric_shirey.html",

But things soon take a turn for the worst when demonic return to get her for reasos that are never really explained. \r\n\r\nAshley Bell proves that she has some talent, but the script and direction are so subpar that it's really hard to care about anyone in the film.

So this is about the same girl (Ashley Bell) who escapes the events from the first movie, only to have similar troubles when attempting to start a new life.  I will admit that I'm not a huge fan of 95% of the exorcism movies that I have seen; I'm still of the mindset that once you've seen one, you've pretty much seen them all, and I'm still waiting for a movie that convinces me otherwise.  The first movie was actually halfway decent, at least until they fumble the ball with the ending.  It was mildly interesting, as they attempted to tell the story through the medium of a found-footage film.  This movie drops that concept like a bad habit, and I can't continue this review without at least mentioning what an oxymoron the title of this movie is.  There are really only so many things you can do with an exorcism movie; there are all of those spikes in the score for things that aren't scary (there is a jump scare sequence in this movie involving a mime.  I'm not making this up), and because of it, you never really trust the movie.  Even the sinister things that happen here don't really have any repercussions; side characters remain unfazed by previous events come the next scene, and there aren't really any consequences until you get to the last 15 minutes.  It's not deplorable or anything, it's just everything you've already seen before.  The best thing I can really say is that it is not quite as terrible as The Devil Inside, which is the faintest of faint praise.",

Abandoning the found footage formula, Part II picks up where its predecessor left off, with Ashley Bell's Nell Sweetzer found acting batshit crazy in someone's kitchen. Soon she's in a mental hospital and soon after in a \"girl's home\" where she seems to be pulling it together. Just when things start to be getting better Nell starts seeing cheesy images and receiving not-so-creepy phone calls. Things escalate at a snails pace as we all wonder if these lame scares are the best we're going to get before Nell ultimately attempts to rid herself of the demon with another exorcism.\n\nSimply put, this is a bad, uninteresting movie with bland characters and blander scares. Ashley Bell actually gives a good performance in the main role but there isn't another one to be found in a film without a single other memorable character or moment. Everything is obvious and paint by numbers with a boring and unscary slow build ultimately arriving at an unsatisfying conclusion. Goofy and or stupid moments? Check. There's a sequence where they try to transfer the demon into a sacrificial chicken.\n\nMade because the micro budget original turned a big profit, this is a film with no reason to exist, and it shows. There simply isn't a story worth telling and the execution is lacking enough that what we're left with is a turd that looks and smells like a turd. There have been many better horror options recently (and I suspect there will continue to be) so there's no reason to check this out unless you're a horror completist.\n\n*1/4 out of 5",

Taking place directly after its predecessor, Nell is found by a young couple shaking and in a sort of trance.  When she finally snaps out of it, she's sent to a home for girls that have been treated poorly to get better and return to society as a better person. Soon, mysterious things begin to happen again and it's up to her to find out how to get rid of the demon once and for all. Now, I didn't think that The Last Exorcism was a bad film. It was a decent little found footage horror film that's well worth a rental. The ending was pretty bad, but overall the first was not bad. This sequel, on the other hand, was completely unnecessary. The woman who plays Nell still does a pretty good job, but even she can't save this train wreck. The script is extremely confusing to follow and left me with more questions than answers. The other actors besides Nell weren't that great, especially the guy who plays her love interest, Chris. His lines were beyond forced and painful to listen to. Usually, I can forgive things like this in a horror film IF they're a) enjoyable and/or b) scary. Sadly, The Last Exorcism Part II is neither of these. It tries way too hard with creepy imagery in order for it to be scary, but it just doesn't work and doesn't pay off in the end. There were parts that made me jump, but they were from misplaced jump scares that were just plain annoying. The film isn't enjoyable either because more than an hour is devoted to slow and poorly made character development. It's not fun to watch and will put anyone to sleep. If there was any redeeming quality to this film, it was the ending. I won't spoil it here, but I can tell you that it is pretty neat to watch. However, is it really worth sitting through the entire movie to get through? No, just fast forward to the last fifteen minutes and you'll leave sort of satisfied. In the end, The Last Exorcism Part II is not scary in the least bit with its slow pace and lack of actual tension. Skip this film at all costs. It's not the worst I've seen this year, but it's pretty damn close.",

I really wanted to enjoy this, but I felt that the film relied on recycled ideas to create its terror. The horror itself is never really terrifying, only a bit unnerving and the filmmakers really could have done something truly special here. Unfortunately the movie suffers from a dull script and performance that just aren't interesting. This sequel just fails at delivering genuine chills and you end up wanting more out of the film. As it is, this is yet another clich\u00e9d horror film that doesn't cover new ground. With that being said, if they were going to make a sequel to the Last Exorcism, they should have put more effort into it because the original was truly an interesting horror film. The Last Exorcism 2 is just a bland horror movie that doesn't shock the way it's supposed to. The film is predictable and we know when everything will happen. This is a poor attempt at cashing in on the original, and they really should have made something better. The Last Exorcism 2 is just another bad horror movie that has been released this year and one that isn't worth your time. Stick with the original, it is a far superior film than this film, and this follow-up relies on old ideas that we've seen many times before. As a genre film, it simply doesn't deliver anything worthwhile for fans of Exorcism films, and it is a failed attempt at crafting a movie that should have been much better than what it turned out to be.",

The editing was choppy in parts and a few extra scenes could have been used to fill in the gaps. The acting was pretty bad, except for a few of the minor characters. I probably wouldn't even give this movie one star but the ending was worth waiting for.

I get the feeling that someone had an idea for how they wanted the movie to end and then just threw together some low rate actors and pushed it straight for the finish. The plot is disjointed, the characters are not well-developed at all, and the story itself seems to plod along and never really get that scary. I'll give them this, aside from the really bad CGI, the ending was kind of fun. I liked that turn of events. But to spend an hour and a half getting there is a little hard to swallow.",

It really did ruin that movie, to the point I severely downgraded the rating I was gonna give it if it had a different and less stupid ending.  So you can understand my skepticism in a sequel to a movie that, even though it had a terrible ending, it was fairly conclusive to me.  And, unsurprisingly, this film isn't that good at all.  If there's one thing that I CAN say about this film is that the ending is considerably better.  Not better to the point it improves the score, but still better.  Another thing is that this film feels different from the first one rather than a rehash.  Unfortunately it also embraces more supernatural aspects and that sort of feels rather generic and tacked on to be honest.  For the most part, other than referencing some of the events of the first film, it pretends that the first flick didn't exist at all.  And it's largely unsuccessful when you rely mostly on what made the first movie fail in the first place.  And the scares are practically nonexistent with none of them really being that good or that effective.  I think the film is concerned with Nell as a character and seeing how she deals with the events of the first film and how she's traumatized and being pressured into 'joining the dark side' so to speak.  At least Ashley Bell is good, she's always been good really.  But her character's development isn't really that interesting.  Dull character development and lack of scares make this an uninteresting and fairly bad film to watch.  Problem is, at least near the end when *SPOILERS* Nell finally joins the 'dark side', there's some potential to do something great, or at the very least something decent, with that and instead of showing you her actions, they just cut away from it and don't show any of it.  And you'd think that in a movie full of terrible attempts at scaring you would give you a little something for your value...but no, they don't.  They take what could've been the best part of the film, as far as horror goes, and they just don't show it.  At least the ending with Nell driving around and causing destruction everywhere as she drives through makes for a really cool visual.  But of course, by this point it is late too salvage this movie, so this cool visual doesn't make up for the ineffectiveness of the rest of the flick.  I just think the movie is put together poorly with Ashley Bell really being the only thing keeping this film from getting a lower rating.  This is a pretty bad movie all things considered.",

The first film left many questions unanswered and you would have thought that the film would go out of its way to answer all of those questions, but instead, not only does it not answer these questions, but it leaves you with so many more.\n\nThe film falls so easily into the typical horror movie style of having clich\u00e9d jump scares that are so telegraphed and predictable, clearly demented characters who are all part of the demonic cult, dumb people who are oblivious to the weird and evil stuff that happens around them . . . the list continues.\n\nThe film obviously wants us to sympathize with Nell (by the way, the actress deserves a lot better than this movie) and whilst it kind of succeeds in that aspect, you lose any sort of investment in her character due to the lazy script that has forced this laughable script, telegraphed plot lines that you see a mile coming, an ending that will leave you face palming with how rock stupid this movie is and coupled with shocking bad special effects - worse than the ones in Mama - everything about this movie reeks of amateurish movie making.\n\nIf you were going to make a sequel, pick it back up from the end of the first movie and find out what happened to the reverend - all I could keep thinking throughout this movie was 'What happened to the reverend? I want to know what happened to him - because all I kept thinking was that this film did not need to be made.\n\nIt should have been left at the end of the first movie and leave us to fill in the pieces for ourselves and let us come up with our own conclusion.

For those who've seen the first movie this one follows a similar pattern in that it trundles along with a few cliche scares and then spontaneously turns awesome in the last 10 minutes. The notable lack of 'found footage' makes for a somewhat more polished ride, if you're interested in the occult or 'left hand path' this is certainly worth a look if you have nothing better to do.",

            "content": "Nell (Bell), the possessed girl seen in the first film, is admitted to a New Orleans home for troubled girls. Her life begins to get on track as she makes friends and takes a job as a chambermaid at a local motel. When she visits a parade in the city with her friends, however, Nell begins to have strange experiences, seemingly followed by a group of masked men and street mimes. Telephones begin to ring when they're not plugged in and voices attempt to speak to Nell through radio sets. It seems Nell may not have escaped her traumatic past.\nLast year, for the third installment of the 'Rec' series, the film-makers cast aside the found-footage aesthetic about a half hour into the film. For the sequel to 2010's 'The Last Exorcism', found-footage is discarded completely. It could be taken as a sign that the sub-genre is finally dead, although this Halloween we'll be treated to yet another shaky-cam episode of the 'Paranormal Activity' series. The 2010 film was strangely under-rated, possibly because it had the hated name of Eli Roth attached as producer. With that film, I recall thinking the found-footage format was no more than an unnecessary gimmick as it had a strong enough story to stand on its own. This sequel, however, could badly use a gimmick.\n\nMuch of the film revolves around a litany of tired horror cliches, all of which we've seen employed in far more effective ways in much more successful films. Even the New Orleans setting has become a default fallback for American horror films, thanks to the city's historic relationship with the practice of voodoo. Bell admittedly does her best with a Sissy Spacek type \"sympathetic yet creepy\" performance. Garner, one of America's best young actresses, is wasted in a support role, though it does add to her growing back catalog of movies regarding cults, having appeared in last year's 'Martha Marcy May Marlene' and 'Electrick Children'.\nThe main problem is that the threat to Nell is never really made concrete. A horror film's success often relies on its villain. 'The Last Exorcism Part II' ultimately collapses due to its lack of a clearly identified one.",

Bell is the only redeeming feature to these movies as she does offer a good projection of a messed up small town girl with haunting secrets.  This however is not matched by any sort of work going into a plot, script or support actors.  The film mainly runs some sequences of mundane sightings and body levitations.  This is a particularly short reviews as the film clocks in at ninety minutes(just) and very little happens and then it just closes with a huge anti-climax disappointingly leaving it open to being stretched into more installments.  If the are more to come I would suggest losing the word LAST from the title, maybe change it to next.",

Some liked the idea, I saw it as a huge waste of time and engagement (not to mention investment) I put into the previous hour. Then along comes The Last Exorcism Part 2 (lol title) that didn't excite me in any sense of the word, but had nothing better to watch that week so I hit it with two friends on a Monday night. We were the only three people in the theatre and I knew I was doomed right then. The Last Exorcism Part 2 sucked the big one. The synopsis was a good idea (the 'possessed' survivor trying to get on with her life; for those who care), but the movie's execution went about it entirely wrong from beginning to end. First off, it didn't want to focus on any themes that were brought up from the previous movie or expand on anything past the set-up of this one! The narrative, as a whole, felt completely disjointed in every way and it seemed like the film was just going from one 'scare' scene to the next without any flow behind it. What was the reason behind these satanists again? Who cares because this movie sure didn't. Without any logic as to their actions, the movie wound up making me laugh at the freaks rather than fear them. Speaking of fear; none of that to be found. Absolutely no momentum or suspense what-so-ever, instead opting for 'jump scares' every 5 freakin' minutes! Furthermore, there were ZERO elements of the horror genre to support this one's cause, no scary imagery (fake looking CG), no gore, no sex (unless you count some noises behind a wall), nothing. I can live with it if there's at least some suspense but it lacked on all fronts. And why were half of these side characters in this again? They just random ass disappeared without any follow-up as to why they existed in this. This is the first movie I've seen helmed by Ed Gass-Donnelly and it's not looking very promising. No creative shots, no suspense, no scares. NOTHING. Point and shoot. Bland as hell. Ashley Bell was the only redeeming quality this flick had. She carried an innocence and very believable show when her character was meant to be scared. Excellent performance wasted on a shitty flick. Julia Garner was very sexy and tried her best with an ambiguous performance. Again, great, but wasted. Spencer Treat Clark tried but had crap to work with. Muse Watson showed up in a small but stand-out role as the shrink. Love that guy! Whether you dug on the first flick or not, this is a huge waste of time. Doesn't respect the original and doesn't try to do anything on its own other than suck us dry of our time and money. Forget it.",

The Last Exorcism - Part II is a pretty bland horror sequel.  I enjoyed the first film, almost three years later, I'm still unsure if I'm fond of the ending.  Incase you missed the first go-round, there's quick flashbacks in the beginning but it's better to see the first, Last Exorcism before this for the full effect.  There are a slew of effective scare moments here that might cause you to jump, it seems like that was where the focus was.  There are quite a few lame sequences here, such as the evil men wearing Mardi Gras masks to the walking statue man.  There are some other moments that made me laugh unintentionally as well.  What hurts is that the creepiness factor I enjoyed from the first film is all but gone.  Outside of the jump moments, the story itself is pretty boring and becomes a generic exorcism movie.  The audience isn't clear what's actually going on and what's going on in the girl's head so it can be unnecessarily confusing.  Ashley Bell does a good job with being creeped out as Nell, the young possessed girl.  The rest of the cast are mostly unknowns including Julia Garner as Gwen, Nell's new friend, Spencer Treat Clark as Chris, a young man interested in Nell and Muse Watson as Frank, the head of the girl's home.  After it's eye rolling finish, I hope The Last Exorcism- Part II is the last of the series but chances are, we'll get a last, last, last exorcism.  \n\nWes' Rating: Suck It!\n\nYoutube: youtube.com/Wesida515\nfacebook: facebook.com/Westroopalist\nTwitter: @WesAlist",

This change in direction means that the film becomes another standard exorcism story. The music in the film is a clear 'jump' indicator, becoming predictable and losing a few scares. The film lacks in gore and terror, and seems to lose track of being a horror. \n\nThe ending allows for a possible Part III, not surprisingly as most modern horrors stretch an idea for all its (monies) worth. A genre in which squeals and trilogies has become the rule, not the exception. Part II loses the originality of Part I by opting for a change in filming technique. So this time don't expect so much back breaking yoga: that shock tactic has been done. Instead brace yourself for a quieter and less shaky camera instalment. \n\nAfter all there are only so many times you can watch a girl do 'the crab'......\n\nFull review at www.horrortrunk.com",

It's one of the more ridiculous sequel ideas Hollywood has come up with just to milk what they can out of horror fans like myself and unsurprisingly, the film is no good.  \n\nThe story continues right where the last film ended but this time, they ditched the fake documentary style and made the sequel a regular, old-fashioned narrative film. Ashley Bell, who made her acting debut in part one as a girl possessed (and is known, I guess, for her incredible contorting skills) again plays Nell, who manages to escape the evil cult that held her captive and somehow ends up in a group home in New Orleans where she tries to rebuild her life. But the demon that had possessed her returns with an even more horrific plan which ends up not being very horrific at all. \n\nAs a whole the film is rather dull and the scares are of the \"shadows walking by the camera and standing in the background\" variety. And that's pretty much it. You never get to see any of the actual good gore on screen - it's just implied. Just like the first film, the filmmakers lead the viewer on with teases that don't really pay off and all of the actual \"horror\" happens at the very end but that itself wasn't very good either. \n\nThe only thing that made this film entertaining was Ashley Bell's incredible, intentionally awkward and believable performance. If the film didn't have her in it, there wouldn't be much there at all. I was rather disappointed that they hardly took advantage of Bell's contorting as well. All of the other characters were incredibly bland and the acting was flat at best, which, coupled with my previous complaints doesn't make for much of a film. As I left the theatre all I kept wondering was \"What the hell was Eli Roth thinking?\" Don't waste your time or money.",

It's ludicrously ironic that buzzing flies often pester the actors in this steaming piece of digital. For every legitimate fright swept out of some dark new corners (thrills courtesy of a living statue street performer moving whenever the protagonist turns her head, an in-house massacre shot from an outdoor POV), there's a bevy of oldest spooks in the Book of Shadows (LOUD sound design, jump cuts) that makes this a devil of a dog.\n\nIn the PG-13-rated thriller sequel, newly exorcised Nell Sweetzer (Ashley Bell) tries to build a new life in a New Orleans home for troubled women, only the demon that once possessed her returns with a more horrific plan. \n\nAs possessed backwoods belle Sweetzer, Bell imbues the character with believable levels of both na\u00efvet\u00e9 and ferociousness. Likewise, director Ed Gass-Donnelly works the horror over with some appropriately scary touches. Still, for all of their hard work, the material needs to have the archetypical demonic moments exorcised. Moviegoers have seen possession portrayed on screen numerous times before (The Devil Inside) and seen it done much much better besides (The Exorcist). Losing the faux-documentary style of Part I certainly distances this deuce as far as look and feel, but audiences didn't need to see The Last Exorcism -no classic piece of horror itself - to despise this latest in a long grime of pea soup.\n\nBottom line: Speaking in Bungs.",

            "content": "I finally get to the movies after missing opportunities for two weeks, and what do I get? I get The Last Exorcism Part II, which is a con job beginning with its laughable title. Do none of the producers understand the meaning of the word \"LAST?\" I mean, Christ, Eli Roth's name was on this piece of garbage. How could someone like Eli Roth get behind this swill? This is the guy who made \"Cabin Fever,\" a sex-filled blood bath that sufficed as my guilty pleasure of 2003. Now he comes out with a sexless, bloodless, clich\u00e9 ridden attempt to get a few jumps out of the less sophisticated movie-goers. That's low. Furthermore, the movie itself is complete and utter trash on every level. For the entire first hour of the film, all the script does is cover up for the fact that it's a sequel. The longest bit of dialogue occurs between our main character, who's name is Nel or something- I never really caught it since everyone always whispers/and or speaks in pro-nouns, and her (friend who's a boy that she likes but he's not her boyfriend since she's like seventeen and she's never had one?). Now, here's what's so ridiculous about their conversation. It lacks even a shred of authenticity. It's all exposition- and it's not even sugar-coated!! So her friend-with-a-dick, Chris, pops out with the fact that he heard she's never had a boyfriend before- because that's a good thing to say to a girl when you want to get in her pants- and then, her response is what got an outright laugh from me. She says, and I quote, \"No, but I think I was pregnant once,\" which is blatant exposition that ties back to the first film, and, incredibly, turns out to be completely irrelevant to the sequel. Apart from that, would anyone in her situation logically say that? NO, that would NEVER happen. This movie is dumber than Lindsay Lohan with a head so far stuck in the clouds, it could make Rick Santorum seem like a rationalist. \n\nThe next problem I have with this filth-on-film is the overwrought, obnoxious Bernard Herman esque score. It doesn't build suspense- it's just annoying, not to mention it contributes to making the film even more predictable than it already is. Oh, the music is getting loud and thumpy so that must mean something bad is going to happen. Idiots! Silence is what builds tensions and elevates fear. Why? Solely because of its unpredictability! I didn't jump once during this movie, because though the producers thought they were staging jumps, they in fact weren't. To stage a jump, one must create an eerie silence, and have that silence last long enough to create a shock when it's suddenly broken. It might not be rocket science, but there is a science to it. \n\nPerhaps I'm so angry with this sour little film because it represents the degradation of horror films as a whole. There's an awful formula that's been established as the number one money-making horror trick the last few years. Step one, abandon all ideas of humor, sex, and take all the violence out to therefore earn a PG-13 rating and widen your audience. Step two, instead of a plot, create 90 minutes of waste, punctuated by two or three jump sequences and a predictable ending. Step 3, release your film, and repeat all three steps at least five times before your awful franchise is truly dead. This is why I was so grateful last year when Joss Whedon and Drew Goddard release the first horror masterpiece in years entitled ironically, \"The Cabin in the Woods.\" They poked fun at the genre while simultaneously transcending it. That in itself is brilliant, not to mention their film overflows with downright hilarity, gallons of blood, creatures from all walks of horror, and two perfectly-timed, ironically introduced Anna Hutchinson boobs. It was a truly perfect horror film. So there ya have it. Instead of paying nine dollars to see this piece of excrement on the big screen, stay in and rent \"The Cabin in the Woods.\" Cameron out.",

I just came home from SM Lipa today and I was so amazed when I watched this film and I never saw the first movie but I'm so interested to watch the first one since I bought it already after watching this film. Now the plot of this film takes place after the events of the first movie where Nell Sweetzer is found terrified alone in rural Louisiana. She gets to stay in New Orleans in some orphanage for girls but soon she discovers that the demon that was in her once is now coming back again and this time the demon has more plans to use her again. To be honest I love this movie and its not really a bad film at all. Its a surprising Horror film that has a lot of impressive ideas and genuine scares with an enormous amount of atmosphere thanks to a brilliant and well paced script and some stylish directing from director Ed Gass Donnelly. I totally love this movie and I have no problems with watching it at all the whole movie just gave me a big wow in the head. What's great about The Last Exorcism Part II is that the whole movie has a lot of genuine and surprising scares from start to finish. There are so many good jump scares within the whole movie. The opening scene was tense, thrilling and super scary at the same time. Scenes from the orphanage where Nell is haunted repeatedly is one of the most intense parts of the film and I love how the atmosphere was well used in that scene which makes it even scarier and scenes like the church scene is one of the creepiest moments in the whole movie and the finale of the film is one of the best and scariest endings in Horror history. I also enjoy a couple of scenes like Chris' death which is probably one of the most unexpected kills in the movie and even though most of the kills are not gory at least I enjoyed the suspense used in every kill scene in the film and every scene in the film just creeped me out a lot and some also made me jump which I totally enjoyed in the movie. One of the other good things about The Last Exorcism Part II is that the whole film has an enormous amount of atmosphere. There are lots of scenes where the lighting is well used and I just adore the ideas of the atmosphere in the whole film and overall this movie has delivered some of the best ideas ever. And the last things that I like about this movie is that the whole film changed its style because I heard the first film is done in a found footage style while this one remained as an ordinary Horror film instead of continuing the found footage technique that's now used in most Horror movies now a days and I was amazed overall with the film's style and technique. Ok I quite admit that the CGI in here is quite well used and there are some parts where the CGI is quite well used and some that are just bad but not horrid but I was ok with certain parts of the film overall. Now the acting is great all of the casts did a really good job with their work in the film so far and the actress who played Nell did a wonderful job with her work in the film and she's very pretty in certain parts of the film while the rest of the casts did a good job with their work in the movie overall. Director Ed Gass Donnelly did a very good job with his work on the film so far and I like how he worked on this movie a lot and I can't wait to see what's his next film. Overall The Last Exorcism Part II is a solid Horror sequel that delivers the goodies and suspense of most exorcism Horror movies and this is definitely one of 2013's most suspenceful Horror films ever made and I would give this movie a 10/10.",

In \"Part II\" of this hopefully two part saga, Nell returns from the events on the farm, a tormented and reclusive young girl. She's placed in a group home and attempts to return her life to some sort of normalcy. Obviously, we can assume this won't happen lightly, if at all. Along with Bell's impressive performance, including a vulnerability and naivety that could easily have been overdone by any other young actress, the scares help keep this film afloat, building tense moments with ease, starting from scene one in a stranger's bed. Made even more creepy by being placed on the streets of New Orleans, not only does \"The Last Exorcism Part II\" delve further than I possibly could have imaged, it actually does so in a somewhat refreshing and unique way. Had the ending been stronger and less of a throwaway, this could have been an above average film. Instead, it rises from its preconceptions and gains at least some sort of respectable stature.",

As she did in the first film, Bell portrays a young woman who is innocent enough, and has been brainwashed enough to buy into the existence of demons. Her performance in the more character-driven moments is what worked for me. We care about Nell, so when terrifying things begin to happen to her, we have an interest in what happens to her.\n\nSome of the downsides to the film occur in its adherence to the tropes of the genre. Most of the scares, meant to make you jump, don't work, because we can see them coming from a mile away. In defense of the film, although, I don't feel like this is where the film gets its creepy effect, but the director, or perhaps the studio, felt it necessary to throw these moments in there. Also, several members of the supporting cast feel stiff and pretty unbelievable, specifically Nell's roommate who has a second act change of personality that doesn't make any sense. And without spoiling anything, the ending is pretty ridiculous, and is just more evidence of the film's failure due to adherence to genre standards.\n\nPart II overcomes its flaws though by introducing a new element to the film towards the end of the second act. This element brings new and interesting characters into the mix that change up the pace, and allow Part II to feel coherent with the previous installment, which up to this point, due to style and mood, felt pretty different. The choice to get away from the found footage genre, that the first installment in the franchise was a part, was a brilliant choice. It allowed the film to feel like it had a purpose, and not have to be tied down to the constraints of having to be shot by one of the characters.\n\nIt's definitely not anything groundbreaking and there are valid complaints about the film, but The Last Exorcism Part II is a creepy and moody horror film that works on many levels.\n\nFor more movie reviews visit: www.reelfive.com",

            "content": "I re-watched 2010's The Last Exorcism just the other day as I planned on seeing the sequel this week. I remembered liking it much more than I expected but not for the reasons one expects when going to see a horror flick. No, I was never truly scared by what I saw on screen with the original film but more I was intrigued by the originality of it. Just when I thought I'd seen every kind of incarnation in which an exorcism could be presented on screen this found footage, documentary-like movie set a new standard for the exorcism film. The heart of that film, despite Ashley Bell's wonderfully innocent performance as sheltered yet possessed farm girl Nell Sweetzer, was Patrick Fabian as Reverand Cotton Marcus. Fabian created a charismatic character that was difficult to like, but at the same time able to create a sympathetic reasoning for his actions. He was a con man toying with peoples beliefs, but he was funny and to be fair he always had the best of intentions. The first film that needed no sequel, that called for no continuation of the story, or left anyone with a desire to see what happened to Nell (I think we all just assumed she died giving birth to a demon child!) was a brief hour and twenty-seven minutes long. The Last Exorcism Part II (which may be the most misleading title in the history of cinema) clocks in at only a minute longer, but feels like it goes on for days. It has an episodic feel to it that never picks up and never feels like a coherent work but instead a compilation of scenes that show our protagonist running from something, who we're never given a real reason as to why, and are expected to be frightened every time a loud sound interrupts the scene over and over again.\n\nread the whole review at www.reviewsfromabed.com",

The Last Exorcism was one that worked pretty well as it made sense to the story and the overall film was executed pretty well, despite the lame ending. To no one's surprise the success of that film spawned a sequel that intelligently decided to move away from the found footage style and make it a normal movie that looks to be pretty cool, despite it's somewhat silly name. \n\nThe Last Exorcism II follows Nell as she tries to build a new life after escaping the events of the original film, but when things seem to be going well the evil that once possessed her returns to take back its host. Much like the Blair Witch Project, Exorcism decided to go this other route with its sequel, but unlike it tried to keep the story intact. The story is perfect for the direction to keep this story moving, but sadly the film doesn't offer all that much. If not for Ashley Bell, reprising her role, this film would have fallen apart fast. She is so great in this role delivering all the emotional torment and innocence needed to make this character work. Beyond here there is really little going on in this movie other than her wandering around Louisiana. We all know that the formula of the possession films is the slow build, but when we already have an established story and character there is no need for it to be this slow. The few moments of \"haunting\" that you do get work well enough, but nothing like the powerful imagery of the first film that made it stand out so much. \n\nThis is one of those sequels that wasn't needed but welcomed in hopes to make up for what they did with the silly ending of its predecessor. Make no mistake this isn't a horrible movie, it is actually still pretty entertaining on some levels, just doesn't push the limits like it should have. The ending proved to be a bit of an interesting direction to continue the series, but was just a bit too little too late to pack the punch it needed. \n\nhttp://www.examiner.com/movie-in-dallas/bobby-blakey",

Like was the blonde hair girl bad or just visions Nell was having? Where did the boy go when she went out in the yard to meet him and why did he leave the movie with no explanation until his lame death scene?\n\nThe film is also pretty boring. Nothing really happens until the final ten minutes. It is well made and looks good, just a lot of talking.\n\nAnd the ending pretty much pisses on every second of both films up until that moment. It will piss you off if any part of you had been rooting for Nell and kindness.\n\nThis movie was such a stain on the original. Big Disappointment.\n\nPS...it's also very sexual.

            "content": "Directed by, Ed Gass-Donnelly, \"The Last Exorcism Part II,\" is the sequel to the fairly successful \"The Last Exorcism.\"  Unfortunately, unlike the first, the second is disappointing. So much so that even the most forgiving of horror fans will find it hard to really enjoy this poorly made film. \n\tThe movie picks up immediately following the first \"Last Exorcism,\" and to add to the confusion of having two last exorcisms, viewers will be expected to assume that somehow main character, Nell, played by Ashley Bell, survived the first. The movie begins with her entering a house down the road from where the movie left off; from there she is taken into a hospital in New Orleans. Then, Nell is taken to an all-female safe house.\n\tThe rest of the movie revolves around Nell trying to escape the demon that has come from back for her. And as exciting as one would think a demon chasing after someone would be; the movie is mediocrely tedious.  \n\tScene after scene is filled with flashbacks to the first movie, as well as random still shots of objects. The film also offers many, many random character entries that offer little depth and add absolutely nothing to the movie other than confusion. The main examples of these random entries are with Nell's new love interest, Chris, played by Spencer Treat Clark, and the entrance of psychic, Cecile, played by Tarra Riggs. In both cases, the characters seem unbelievably involved in Nell's life within a matter of seconds after meeting each other.\n\tThen to top this issue off, the acting within the movie comes with so many failures, both Tarra Riggs and Spencer Treat Clark's characters seem fake and pushed. This creates huge setbacks in the movie that make the film so unbelievable because both character's emotions are hardly passable as real.\n\tPerhaps one of the only good things about \"The Last Exorcism Part II\" is Ashley Bell. Where there are so many failures in the acting, she is a gem. Unlike the others everything she does sounds and feels real. Bell is convincingly crazy and plays the role of a possessed psycho almost too well.\n\tLastly, one other entertaining factor within the movie is the buildup of suspense.  The film offers many suspenseful moments, and while this is entertaining to follow, viewers will be disappointed as each scene ends with emptiness and poor excuses for scares. In fact, the movie's scariest moments are actually within the flashbacks to the first \"Last Exorcism.\"\n\tIn all actuality, \"The Last Exorcism Part II,\" could probably have passed as an average to mediocre horror film, but once the final scene begins, all hope for the movie is lost with an extremely inauthentic and cheesy ending filled with special effects of random props lighting on fire. The movie will most definitely let even the genre's biggest fans down. It is a snooze fest filled with disappointing suspense, poor acting, and cheap effects;  all built off of still shot scenes of random objects and flashbacks.\n\nhttp://rileysopinion.blogspot.com/",

The trailer is as good as it gets! As much as I love Ashley Bell and think she is an incredible actress, the movie was awful, predictable and the finale was 10 minutes on a table with nothing happening. No bending in obscene angels like advertised on the poster never happens. I'm really disappointed with Eli Roth, normally I love his movies! (Hostel, Hostel 2, Cabin Fever) and looking forward to his new movie coming out called \"Aftershock\". I can say if it wasn't for Ashley Bell's acting the movie would be a total write off, but not even she can save a terrible movie! I have to finish by saying Nell is no Carrie....LOL Leave the random fires to her when she's on a rampage! LOL If they do make a Part 3 I can guarantee you in will go straight to DVD, I don't think this movie is going to do well at the box office :-(",

Near the end where I was waiting for the actual encounter with the Demond I was sadly let down with a few more jump scares and more of there crappy cgi I just can't stand cheep cop outs like this so no do not see this plz save an hour of your life and see something good this is not worth it AT ALL !!!!!!!",

            "content": "Another Modern Day Classic\nBy: Dennis Campbell\n\nThrough the slew of terrible movies in this early season a beacon of light has appeared. It is not an overblown drama, nor was it a depressing love story; although the ending is by far one of the saddest I have seen in quite some time. Forgive me for being vague however I feel this movie deserves all the credit that can be mustered out of a small review. For not only has it saved what is usually the worse quarter of the year in terms of movies, it has also given new life to a genre which has been on life support since Freddy Kruger stopped murdering people in their sleep. The film in question is The Last Exorcism Part II. The film picks up shortly after the first one ends, there is a pan over the woods which Nell was dragged through and tortured in. On the ground is the video camera used in the first film, seeing it lie alone without an owner starts a steady buildup of Hitchcock like frights that culminate in a terrifying sequence that not even Wes Craven could have imagined. From the woods we are taken to a small house where a couple is laying in bed, the woman gets up to use the restroom, and taking her place is Nell. Ashley Bell, the actress who practically made The Last Exorcism returns in a demonic state. After attacking the male she scurries beside a refrigerator, and as the camera focuses in on her red eyes we know that Abalam has returned.  \n\nFrom there Nell goes to be evaluated by a list of doctors, and just like any good horror film there is a moment of peace. The clouds part and sunlight shines down upon the life of Nell. Whatever happened to her in the woods was only a fantasy, and although she does not know what lies ahead in her heart she knows it will be good. She meets a boy named Chris (Spencer Treat Clark), and they begin somewhat of a romance together. And for about thirty minuets of the movie all is well, that is until the phone rings. \n\nNell answers a phone call and hears the sound of a baby crying on the other end. This however is just the beginning, from there visions of her late father begin to haunt her, pleading with her to resist evil. At every turn Nell's innocence is in danger and she becomes what so many characters in horror films are not, she becomes relatable. Her soft presence and insecurity tugs at the hearts of the viewers and it aches every time she is in pain. A fabulous example of how she wins the hearts of the audience over is very early on in the film when she utters the line,\n\n\"Nice boots.\"\n\nOf course you will have to see the first part to understand the significance of this line. But it captures so much emotion that it becomes a signature line in the movie. Then of course her friends begin to turn on her, or at least she believes so. The brilliance of the first part of this series is not so much the acting involved, but how open the storyline is to the possibility the Nell is simply schizophrenic. Although this idea is partially discredited early on in the film, the question of that never leaves until the very end. If anything makes this movie worth watching it is the ever present uncertainty of whether we are watching a possessed woman, or just a schizophrenic.   \n\nBut it is not just Ashley Bell who performs well in this movie; there is the flawless acting performance of Spencer Treat Clark. His childish image is a great match for Nell's insecurity, there is a scene where the two are at a zoo and Nell asks why he likes her so much. Although Chris has no real reason, the connection is clearly there. The only thing sadder than the ending is seeing the boy we have come to like commit suicide. And even worse perhaps, he was possessed by Abalam. Shortly after his death the phone rings again, and it is Chris on the other line.\n\nIn one act of defiance and strength Nell swears vengeance upon Abalam, and so beings the heartbreaking ending.\n\nLocked inside an enchanted room Nell is being prepared for yet another exorcism, and as it begins Abalam appears before her, unseen to the other four participants. As Nell screams in agony Abalam inches closer, he is wearing a mask. As the air is sucked out of the theater he reveals who he truly is, Abalam is not a he, but Nell herself. It is revealed that it is her destiny to become Abalam, to rule over the world and bring forth the End Times. As this revelation is made between the two Nell's, the Priest conducting the exorcism injects Nell with a deadly dosage of morphine. While her strength fades, she is presented with a choice. Take Abalam's hand and accept who she truly is, or die without fulfilling her destiny. \n\nJust before she can make a decision her heart monitor goes flat and she dies, but some of her subconscious still lingers behind those eyes of hers. While the remainder of the group cries Nell jolts up, and takes Abalam's hand.   \n\nAfter murdering those who tried to save her, Nell returns to her boarding house and faces her guardian. \n\n\"Nell?\" He asks \n\nShe shakes her head no. \n\nThen, in a flash his body is bashed against the door and the house is set on fire. One of the last images that we see of Nell is her wearing the boots she spoke of early on in the film. It is then we know the transformation is complete; there remains nothing of Nell the sweet girl who cherished all things. All that remains is Abalam, and as the film ends he drives down the street setting everything ablaze. \n\nWhile the film may not be as well thought out as the first one, The Last Exorcism Part II is every bit as terrifying and bone chilling. Although this film may not receive the best reviews I urge all those who read this to go in with an open mind. And once the credits roll make up your own mind, and say a prayer for Nell.",

Regardless , the movie does enough in its opening minutes to lead you into the sequel. If only anything mattered...\n\nIf the fact that that the title is The Last Exorcism : Part 2 didn't tip you off that the movie is probably a cash-grab and most likely a terrible film I'll briefly explain why this film is pure trash. Nell has apparently developed amnesia of the events of the first film but nevertheless is trying to live a normal life again. We meet some new characters , we see \"spooky\" stuff for an hour with heaps of people dying off camera or having seizures , we have an exorcism , and roll credits.\n\nThe rest of this review applies to every other exorcism movie out there so accurately I may just copy and paste it into future reviews. The Exorcist was an absolutely harrowing film because it was grounded in reality and boasted effects for its time that have stayed with people even to this day. To this day it also has phenomenal writing and directing. You cannot tell a compelling exorcism tale through shock value , jump scares, terrible acting, horrific dialogue , and half-assed scenarios conjured up on a toilet and put to a piece of paper. To anyone attempting to make an exorcism movie ; please watch The Exorcist and understand why it's regarded as the greatest horror film of all time.\n\nIf these movies continue to get made, all I ask is that we get one that is decent. I'm not going into these movies expecting for a classic to be shattered but how I approach every movie. I want to be entertained based on the merits of the film. It is absolutely pathetic that a comedy as terrible as Marlon Wayans' A Haunted House is somehow a respectable parody of the garbage that is The Last Exorcism: Part 2.",

Although all the other actors/actresses are just mediocre and have nothing but motto toned looks and stupid dialogue. This movie has some scares but also to many jump scares. The movie is not a suspence builder like the first one was instead it is a face paced jump scare movie. There are some freaky parts that have suspence here and there but as a overall you feel let down and don't know when it is going to end.

While the film takes place in New Orleans they take a good shot at using the environment to the story. The ending did disappoint me a bit. I thought that it would be an epic confrontation. It wasn't but it wad pretty cool. I thought that the acting really shined especially from ashelu bell who looks like Judy Garlend.\n\nTo sum this up it has small scares, great performances, weak middle, strong beggining and end. Yet unoriginal and sort of predictable. Still better then \"Mama.\" Which made me happy. I'm giving this movie a decent review because it was a bit better then my original expectation.\n\nSCORE: 6 out of 10\nCBS films, Rated PG-13, 88 min.",

Did you really thing your movie was going to be good when it's called The LAST Exorcism PART 2??!! I'll start off with the only two good things this movie had. The directing and Ashley Bell. The directing in this was pretty solid and not a bad job. I liked how the director worked with the camera and where he positioned it and how he captured all the things around. And Ashley Bell. She wasn't bad. She was the only decently acted part in this whole movie. She tried her best and ill giver he props for it. Now, everything else in this pile of crap is AWFUL. Everything. The other actors in this are pure crap. They all suck. The script in this is beyond stupid and dumb and doesn't make an ounce of sense. The \"visuals and CGI\" in here was so fake and poorly done. And not one thing in this is scary. its so unscary its laughable. And the ending. Dear god was that awful. I won't spoil anything but just know that it is as worse as the ending from The Devil Inside. It is that shitty. The Last Exorcism Part 2 is beyond stupid, awful, unscary, dumb, shitty, corny and just plain bad. The acting sucks except for Ashley Bell and everything else is just plain terrible. It may seem like I'm crapping on this movie hard, which I kind of am, but I'm just warning you how awful this is. Do not ever see this, stay far away from it as possible. Already a contender for worst movie of 2013 so far.",

            "content": "The Last Exorcism: Part II is that classic timeless example that Hollywood horror sequels never work and are just a waste of time and money.  When I went to see the original film I enjoyed its found footage method and the way it handled its tension and characters, and although it wasn't great I still thought it was an effective horror film.  But this film loses almost complete track of what made the first film interesting and clever, and this ends up being nothing but crap.  The beginning of every year is filled with a bunch of crappy horror films that nobody wants to see, and that is precisely why they put it at the start of the year.  There is a small piece of footage from the original film in this movie, and I promise you that is going to be the scariest part of this film.  I mean I can't remember seeing a horror film that was actually as non-scary as this one.  I was never frightened, or shaking, or even closing my eyes, I just sat there and looked at the time to see when I could leave.  It's hard to fully explain how unoriginal and predictable a film like this is, and if you watch the end of the film you know they are preparing another sequel and this scares me.  I don't want to pay more of my money to see another bad and uninteresting sequel with no reason to exist, because this film has already accomplished that.  Ashley Bell is probably one of the most awkward and uninteresting actresses of her generation, and I sincerely hope she doesn't continue her career in the horror genre.  If you are looking to spend money on a scary time, I suggest you turn around and run away as fast as you can.\n\n  The story follows Nell (Ashley Bell) as she is returned to a normal life after the events of the first movie, away from her brother and father. But she is brought back into her old life when supernatural things start occurring around her and her friends.\n\n  The plot is so pointless, predictable, boring, deficient, nonsensical, laughable, and overall just plain bad that I hate having to write a review for it.  I didn't care about any of the characters, and most of them spend time just being clich\u00e9s that I could've cared less what happened to them.  This is a concept that hundreds of horror films have done before, but the producers must believe because it's a sequel to a moderate box-office success that somehow it will make for good filmmaking, but they were wrong.  But I think what made me mostly angry about this ludicrous story is the same problems most horror movies have, and that is the fact that it's just not scary.  When I pay my money to be scared, I expect the movie to actually be slightly scary, but sadly this film depends all on cheap and pathetic jump scares that wouldn't scare a 2-year old.  Some people believe that I give horror films a hard time because I am not a fan of horror films, but on the contrary I love horror films but only if I feel that I have been scared.  I enjoy old school horror films such as \"The Shining\" or \"The Exorcist,\" and sadly I haven't seen a horror film in years that could even come close to classics like those films.  This film feels like it wants to become some big franchise like \"Saw\" or \"Paranormal Activity\" but if you ask me it couldn't survive becoming a series.  Characters that are boring and one-dimensional, a story that completely depends on the original film, and a concept that has been used many times before by many better films.  I hated the script, and I think the money grubbing filmmakers could've cared less. \n\n  The cast mainly consists of Bell's boring and talentless performance, and it disappoints me because she actually gave the original film a spark of hope.  Ashley Bell gave a mysterious, dangerous, and even creepy performance in this films predecessor, but that was mainly because she was a supporting character.  Now the writers decided it would be smart to make her the star of the film and carry the weight of the entire cast, which might've been the dumbest move I have seen in a long time.  She just seems sick the entire film, and I realize this is the point of her character, but it just doesn't work with my taste.  She just sees a lot of danger but she rarely is actually under any danger, and I think we see her yell and scream more than just talking.  She hasn't become a popular actress or even well known, and so I don't know why they believed it would be smart to make her star in this film.  There is a small number of supporting actors in the film that I will not even bother mentioning, because my guess is that this is the highest any of their careers are going to get.  Overall Bell's awkward and senseless performance can't carry any of the weight of the films witless story.\n\n  The Last Exorcism: Part II bored me to death and destroyed any chance of this becoming a franchise.  Director Ed Gass-Donnelly had high hopes when I saw his film \"Small Town Murder Songs\" which was a well-directed and written film, but now I believe he has shattered the progress he made with that previous film and has given us a sloppy and laughable horror flick.  He gives this horror film no soul or edge to make us actually care about what is going on, and it feels like they made this as quickly as possible so he could just take his money and go home.  This film reminds of when I was told they were making a sequel to \"The Human Centipede,\" a film that some people enjoyed and some people just couldn't swallow.  Some people were very disappointed also with \"The Last Exorcism\" so why on earth would they decide to make sequels for these two films?  Sometimes I wonder what could be going on in a filmmakers head, and I just miss the days when horror films actually used to be fun and scary.  This film tries nothing new and has nothing to show us other than a few flashy jump scares that, as I said before, couldn't scare a baby.  I think most people will have a good sense and realize what a piece of trash this is, and I hope most people will have some common sense and just stay home and save their money for a better film.",

One of the main things that surprised me about the film was how great the camerawork was. This surprisingly had some great shots. (not another found footage film) The plot was also very nicely put-together. Things I really hated about it: The script was horrible; there is this one scene (boy and girl date scene) where screenwriting could have been written better by my 9 year old sister. Another thing I really hated were the scares, It relied on Jump Scares. Not only did they go on for like 20 seconds; but it happens consistently throughout and right behind each other. Some of them are sadly displayed and Some are just like.....really? The scares aren't too impressive because it's in the beginning of the film and so instead of you sitting there for 45 mins bored as hell and you begging for some stuff for happen, they throw in some shitty jump scares and there's where your ten dollars went. One of my biggest thing with this film: The Ending. It's another shitty ending and as you can kinda examine from the title; It doesn't end here. The Ending was done so awkwardly and just out-of-place, It could have been SO MUCH BETTER. It lefted you in just this awkward feel like.....ahh...Ok..cool. Overall, Better than the first, but not much better. This could be a decently well trilogy if the third one gets good.",

Funny with some creepiness and a burst of disturbing at its unexpected if slightly hammy conclusion. The no. 1 thing I loved about that film was Cotton the Reverend, the second thing Nell played by Ashley Bell in a physically daunting, creepfest performance. So when I heard they were developing a sequel I was game Because the first film had created characters that I liked. But as the release loomed closer I realized that Cotton wasn't going to be part of the mix which was a little bit of a let down. However even though the trailer looked a little silly, well a lot I wanted to give the film makers props for not going with the know annoying found footage routine and updating out main characters story to something more classically cinematic. The results are mixed but it's safe to say that there's enough to merit a soft recommendation. The film picks up the moments after the events of the original where Nell is found traumatized and brought into a girl's halfway house. Everything seems well enough at first as she begins to adjust to everyday activities. It's a little lifetimeish as she listens to her first ipod, wears some lipstick and has her first real kiss but we like the character and Bell keeps it engaging. But strange things begin to happen and we slowly but surely discovering that the demon from the original is still looking for her to fulfill a prophecy of horrific proportions. It all sounds a little generic but the way in which the material is approached is somewhat interesting because you see the demon has in fact fallen in love with her and is sort of courting her destroying the life around her. It's a n intriguing concept sadly not fully explored but hidden inside this is great one and had they had more a budget to hide this hokey effects (cartoon cgi fire ugh), A more in depth screenplay and a harder rating which would have allowed them to show more this could have been a real blast. There is potential that runs throughout the film populated by solid performances especially for the genre, some decent scares, a creepy indie atmosphere and some really nice cinematography (the shadow work is impressive). But in the end it fails to really deliver on any of its promises which is sad and with its dismal box office and a feisty finale which could have led to something pretty cool it doesn't look like we are going to see another entry. Maybe we'll get lucky and they will explore the concept further on a direct to DVD sequel. But regardless of the films faults of which there are many it's a lot better than most of the big studio crap they've been releasing like The Possession and The Apparition at least there's a story here an an intriguing one at that. 3/5",

It has some suspense and the girl is acting really good. The ending was a bit of strange and the plot had many gaps and it left you some questions about this movie. It was a good sequel though I expected to see Nael's brother who was in that kind of sorority in the end of the first one. However, it is entertaining despite the fact some things will not be easily understood or actually explained. Maybe the producers should have read again the script. I didn't understand the ending. she destroys the world or something like that? Not sure. HOWEVER, is is an enjoyable horror film and much better than the first one. It will scare you at some moments and make you stand up from your chair. Not a must-see but a good horror film just for fun if you want to be scared ",

Like, there is a scene when the girl is sleeping with the other girls and she gets a late night visit from Abalam. Well, just ignore everyone else...and just touch her? It felt like I was watching a censored or blocked version of the movie. Some of the acting was decent, but the supposded boyfriend was not very convincing to me. He at first was a random guy, and then turns out to be a stalker and then gets possessed? The sound effects and visual effects are solid for this movie, but these are the things that make horror movies the best. Unfortunately, this movie failed to get me have the feeling of being scared, either build up horror or sudden horror. Some characters were also a waste and not much story around them. Overall, a decent movie. But fell short on delivering the scary moments when it needed to. And too many boring, wasted scenes and characters.",

There is\"The Last Exorcism Part II\" continues the story of Nell and the demon who wants her-Abalam. With a new director but the same actress as the first film, Ashley Bell. \"Part II\" is straight up horror story telling in a classic format. There is no documentary style footage present save the internet shot of the footage from the first film so the opportunity to really utilize basic but brilliant gimmicks for shock and thrills are very well in hand for this film. Which I think the director managed to use quite well without being too obvious or any real \"fail\" issue for the most part.\r As far as the film's ability to bring the scares, I have to say that the film did it's job. There were moments that normally would not have been scary nor interesting in the film but because the director utilized the trick of closed in frame shots in most of the scenes random moments became thrilling. The story is more focused and open to the viewer with no real hidden plot which allows for more imagery and dogma that surround the whole possession culture and mystical icon-ism to play a big part in staging the story. It is a true classic horror story in all ways. That normally would seem like a bad thing but thankfully this director knew how to shoot the film and set up the moments that needed to be scary or exaggerated enough to make the movie work. Until the ending of course. That I have issue with. I appreciated the twist that says not every one gets a Hallmark moment but for me it came off cheesy and that boiled down to the use of CGI when more organic FX would have came off better for what the director was going for. \"The Last Exorcism Part II\" is a better story and movie than the first film but the first film had a way better ending.",
