            "review_title": "An Honest and Emotionally Devastating Film about Life, Love and Sexuality",
            "content": "I just want to start off by saying this is an amazing film about young love that is actually honest with its audience. There are countless of films about people falling in love, but when you see \"Blue is the Warmest Colour\". You realize just how rare films are that make a sincere attempt to catch what it really is like to fall for someone, without sentimentality, forced cuteness or cheap emotional manipulation. This is the rare love story that has real emotional truth about it. The fact that it is about two women who fall for each other is almost secondary to the way the film catches the universality of what it is like to fall in love and maintain the relationship. \"Blue is the Warmest Colour is a naturalistic and touching film, whether you're gay, straight, bisexual, or whatever orientation. This is a film that can give you relationship advice and life guidance no matter what your orientation may be. It isn't an indulgent film bringing only a unique gay relationship to light and nothing more, and it isn't an ode to \"coming out\" and stockpiled clich\u00e9s of \"being different.\" It shows how an interaction with a person can have a truly provocative impact on you as a person.The struggles between the two lovers is depicted in breathtaking detail. The director masterfully captures all of the turmoil and hardship going on between Adele's and Emma's relationship. The movie's long running time does not effect the film at all because you are so immersed into their characters. The sexual realization of Adele is perfectly shown in the movie. She is confused and doesn't know what she wants, it is a typical teenage problem. This movie is ultimately about Adele and her struggles to find her true self. The transformation that she experiences is utterly engrossing to watch. The film's nearly three hour running time is devoted to showing the growth of her character and it is absolutely amazing to watch it unfold right in front of your eyes.The intimate scene's between Adele and Emma are nothing short of miraculous in their depth and their honesty. The conversations are heartfelt, and the pain is evident and shared. It's realism of the world we live in is honest and raw.The movie owes so much of it's emotional power to its two fantastic actresses. They really bring it their all in this. I've never had doubts of these two performances, the characters felt like real people and you felt so much for their relationship. Their emotional hardships feel completely real. The character's flaws and insecurities feel so authentic because you actually believe them as real human beings. We never lose sight of their chemistry and devotion to one another, even in the most difficult of times. The two of them are like fireworks, waiting to explode out. I cannot recommend this film enough to those of you out there who are interested in seeing this. This is one of the wisest and least condescending films I've seen this year. I congratulate the director, Abdellatif Kechiche and the two actresses, Adele Exarchopoulos and Lea Seydoux for an emotional and spiritual journey that had me compelled to the screen for 179 glorious minutes.",

            "review_title": "The life of Adele",
            "content": "This year's Palm d'Or winner is a coming of age story about a teenage girl, Adele (the literal title in French is The Life of Adele), who discovers her homosexuality and begins a relationship with Emma, a college student. For a while, I was thinking this was a good but fairly unremarkable entry into the queer cinema canon, but, over the film's three hours, well, you see why the long running time was necessary. It is just a very detailed picture of a life. It feels more real than most films - it feels like more time has past and that we've just felt Adele's growth. Frankly, I didn't feel the length of it at all - I wanted it to be longer. It really helps that the actresses are so perfect. Adele Exarchopoulos is simply fantastic - this is the performance of the year, really. Her face is so expressive. The film takes place over several years, and you really do see her grow from a child to an adult. Lea Seydoux plays Emma. Her role is less demanding, but she's still great in it. Now, the biggest story of this film has probably been the graphic sex scenes. My opinion on them: I actually do think they're a bit too graphic, gratuitous and almost pornographic. I try to justify them artistically in my mind, and I'm afraid I can't. There's a plot point near the end where you kind of have to know that the girls' sex life was fantastic, but I'm not sure we had to see it in anywhere near as much detail as we did. They're without a doubt awkward to sit through, but they don't ruin the film either.",

            "content": "Though Blue is the Warmest Color, winner of the Palme d'Or at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival, contains graphic depictions of sex, it is not a voyeuristic exercise but a complex, deeply intense film that elevates one young woman's personal struggle into a drama of universal relevance. Adapted by Kechiche and Ghalia Lacroix from the novel by Julie Maroh, Tunisian born French director Abdellatif Kechiche's fifth feature looks with piercing eyes into the coming-of-age years of Ad\u00e8le (Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos), and her relationship with the more mature Emma (Lea Seydoux), a relationship that does not fit anyone's pictures. First seen as a 15-year-old teenager, Ad\u00e8le's growing pains are magnified by her attraction to women and she is forced to defend herself against the bullying accusations of her high-school classmates, even though she is confused and uncertain about her identity. Ad\u00e8le's face radiates an attractive childlike innocence and openness that is appealing to both sexes and she does not want for friends, but her first relationship with fellow student Thomas (Jeremie Laheurte) does not get off the ground. Her feelings about Thomas seem to answer the question asked by a teacher lecturing on Pierre de Marivaux's novel La Vie de Marianne, \"How do you understand that the heart is missing something?\" After being attracted to a striking looking woman with blue-tinged hair passing by on the street, Ad\u00e8le meets Emma at a gay bar, learning that she is an aspiring artist and an individual of uncommon intellectual tastes. The chance encounter leads to a relationship and the depiction of an explicit sex scene that is notable for its believability and the raw emotions that are expressed but has, unfortunately, become a source of finger pointing in some quarters. Although the chemistry between the two lovers is unmistakable, Kechiche makes sure that we notice how different their backgrounds are, displaying contrasting scenes at the home of both parents. Their relationship is openly accepted by Emma's bohemian parents who persuade Ad\u00e8le to eat oysters and drink white wine, though seafood is the one type of food she had said she dislikes. In contrast, the nature of their liaison is never brought up at Ad\u00e8le's more working-class home where they eat spaghetti and drink red wine. The passage of time is seamless and we have to catch up to the fact that three years have gone by. Ad\u00e8le, now 18, has moved in with Emma and has fulfilled her ambition to teach young children, while both families seem to have disappeared into the woodwork.After the first blush of sexual ecstasy has run its course, however, their incompatibility surfaces and is painfully present at a dinner party of Emma's friends when Ad\u00e8le has to play the role of servant and gets an uncomfortable feeling about Emma's attraction to another woman. Eventually, their social and cultural differences get in the way and jealousy and feelings of betrayal begin to replace mutual satisfaction. Blue is the Warmest Color is unique in its openness and honesty about same-sex relationships although we never really experience the outsider status in society and emotional toll that such relationships normally bring. The performances, however, are so perfect that we are never conscious of anything except the beauty of two human beings discovering the joys of authentic intimacy and a connection that can keep providing enough emotional richness to last a lifetime.",

            "review_title": "A stunning film",
            "content": "While watching 'La Vie d'Ad\u00e8le', I regularly thought about 'Entre les Murs', the winner of the Palme d'Or in Cannes five years ago. Not only because in both films many scenes take place in classrooms, but also because they both have an ultra-authentic feeling. Many of the scenes in this film look so real that it's almost hard to believe they are acted at all. Take for instance one scene in the beginning of the film. Five schoolgirls are chatting about a boy who is standing a few meters away, and who is clearly interested in one of the girls. The conversation, and the way the girls behave is so natural, it's almost impossible to script this. And in fact, many scenes are hardly scripted. Much is improvisation, and the actors were encouraged to do whatever they felt like doing, whatever came natural to them. Director Kechiche apparently shot for several months and came up with 800 hours of footage. The result is stunning. This is a movie that is not only reminiscent of 'Entre les Murs', but also of the films made by the Belgian brothers Dardenne. These are films showing the real lives of real people, without make-up, without scripted lines and without any cinematographic glamour. There are so many scenes that make you feel like you're peeping into other people's lives. Take for example the scene of Ad\u00e8le eating spaghetti with her parents, while watching television. Hardly a word is said, but this little scene tells more about Ad\u00e8le's life than fifty lines of dialogue. The best thing about the movie, apart from the directing, is actress Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos. Her performance is an extraordinary accomplishment. She shows every possible emotion: indifference, astonishment, grief, anger, joy, sadness, and yes, sexual excitement, without once giving the impression that the emotion is not real, that she is just acting. In Cannes, both she and L\u00e9a Seydoux were awarded the Palme d'Or, but is is Exarchopoulos who steals the show. The film is a classic coming-of-age drama. Ad\u00e8le is a high school girl who falls in love with art student Emma. They have a passionate relationship, but it is doomed because working class girl Ad\u00e8le doesn't fit in with Emma's snobby friends. The two girls really don't have very much in common. Ad\u00e8le gets a job as a nursery teacher and is passionate about her work, but this doesn't resonate with Emma who thinks she should develop a more creative passion, like writing. The best scene about the difference between the two girls (again without words) is when Ad\u00e8le is washing the dishes after a party, while Emma is in bed reading a book about the painter Egon Schiele. The fact that the lovers are both female is in fact irrelevant for the film. Their being lesbian is hardly an issue. Much has been said about how 'lesbian' the movie really is. The answer is: it is not. Some viewers have complained that the sex scenes are unrealistic and shown from a male perspective. This might be true, and it is completely understandable, given that this film is not meant as a statement about lesbianism. In fact, one of the sex scenes shows Ad\u00e8le with a boy, and is filmed in much the same way. There is in fact a lot of very explicit sex in the film. This serves the story, but the length of the scenes and the way they are filmed suggest that director Kechiche secretly hoped for a bit of controversy. The film is almost three hours long, but doesn't feel that way at all. Many scenes are long, but they are such a joy to watch you almost regret that they are not even longer. Many reviewers and watchers have said that, after watching the movie, they feel that they really have got to know Ad\u00e8le and the way she feels. I can only agree.",

            "content": "This widely acclaimed, almost three hour movie about adolescent lesbian love in a high school in France is nothing special in my opinion. Tunisian born director Abdelatif Kechiche has shown some sensibility in previous movies (for instance Games of Love and Chance) but this Cannes festival winner feels quite exploitative (his previous movie, Black Venus, was also nasty, disappointing and sensationalistic). The young actresses who play the lead (Lea Seydoux and Adele Exarchopoulos), who are not porn actresses, appear in very explicit, apparently non simulated sex scenes (including masturbation, oral sex, fingering and doing the sex position popularly known as the 69). It would be interesting to wonder if a lesbian director (instead of a male director) would have filmed this story differently, perhaps less explicitly and more subtly. Interestingly, both actresses have complained after the film was released that they felt exploited during the filming and will not work with the director again. Based on a graphic novel.",

            "content": "Forget, for a moment, that \"Blue is the Warmest Colour\" is the story about two women in love. Here is a movie so universal in its themes and so broad in its emotions that it could really be about people of any gender, race or sexual orientation. While Hollywood films simply prattle on about love while merely copying sitcom nonsense, here is a French film that will mean something to anyone who has ever had the pleasure and the pain of being in love.\"Blue is the Warmest Colour\" was the winner of Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival last May, and has been the center of media attention due to a pair of scenes depicting the two female lovers engaged in graphic sex that has \u2013 how does one put this nicely? \u2013 a very French sensibility. It is true. We see the lovers naked, laid bare with little to hide, particularly during the first of two encounters, an eye-opening seven-minute scene of raw sexuality in which the bodies twist this way and that in a manner that might make some viewers uncomfortable. Yet, while those scenes are striking, it is the film that surrounds these two women that captures our imagination. For all the news of scenes of sweaty sexual fumblings, the most tantalizing organ on display is the human heart.Based on a graphic novel by Julie Morah, \"Blue is the Warmest Colour\" tells the story of Ad\u00e8le and Emma, two intelligent and heartfelt people who, through simple cosmic fate, fall desperately in love. The movie sees their relationship over the course of a decade, mostly through the eyes of Ad\u00e8le, a pretty 17 year-old high school girl with pouty lips and an expression that suggests a great deal of unhappiness. She's that very rare teenager who always seems to be waiting for something. Her classmates live in the moment, but Ad\u00e8le seems to be searching for some kind of meaning in her life. As the film opens, her eyes suggest that she is lost in the world. When the movie is over she will have the same look in her eyes, but for a completely different reason.At school, she has a circle of friends but they seem distant somehow. She tries to touch the social strata but nothing really engages her. She begins dating a nice guy named Samir. They talk and before long she shares his bed. Something in her eyes in their post-sexual encounter seems sad. The parts are there but, in her mind, there seems to be a sexual component that is missing here. The relationship doesn't last long and she breaks his heart.Then something happens. While walking with her friends one day, she passes a blue-haired girl on the street walking the other way. It is only a passing glance but, for Ad\u00e8le, it leaves a startling impression. This parting glance stays on her mind for days and days until one night, while out with friends, she makes an unexpected left turn into a gay bar hoping the find the girl. She does, and they begin to talk. The girl is Emma, a pretty college student who is studying art. Emma and Ad\u00e8le talk a lot. They talk about art, about music, about philosophy, about themselves. They talk about their dreams. Ad\u00e8le reveals that she wants to be an elementary school teacher; Emma wants to be an artist. Days later, on a park bench, they pause in their conversation and share a kiss. They go home and have sex. Afterwards they talk some more. Ad\u00e8le finds her life turned around, especially by her former friends who cruelly interrogate her for hanging around with a lesbian \u2013 a reminder that even as open as we are about homosexuality, a social stigma still exists.What is happening between Emma and Ad\u00e8le is a building relationship that will last for several years. The miraculous thing is that the story is constructed in such a realistic way that we never know where it is going. Director Abdellatif Kechiche shoots the film in a way that makes us feel as if we are standing in the room with the characters. There are no glossy, pretty images. When they sit at dinner, we are sitting at the table with them. Kechine gets in close, and allows us to get to know the characters intimately. He is an expert at photographing the landscape of the human face in close-up so that every emotional tic is on display. We come to care about the fate of these two girls and it pays off in the film's climax, a heart-rending moment that will break your heart as the lovers realize what their fate must be. The weight of that moment stands for the fate of all lovers in crisis. What they do with that moment determines the destinies for both.To understand what a remarkable achievement this film is, you have to see it in relation to most other movie love stories. Other films want to throw problems at the characters that are there to be solved. The problems for Ad\u00e8le and Emma are borne out of their personalities. Not one moment in this film feels phony or contrived. It moves with the rhythms of real life and ends on a welcomed, life-goes-on note that leaves us with something to talk about afterwards. This is one of the best films of the year.**** (of four)",

But love is eternal while it lasts. \"La vie d'Ad\u00e8le - Chapitres 1 et 2\" is a movie of lesbian exploitation disguised in art. The love story between Ad\u00e8le and Emma is too graphic and there is no art in watching two women sucking, licking and caressing each other many times for a long period in excessive sex scenes. The camera work is awful, with close up most of the time. The screenplay forgets Ad\u00e8le's parents and should be shorter and shorter. The lead actresses have good performances and the story of lesbian love and rejection is not bad. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): \"Azul \u00e9 a Cor Mais Quente\" (\"Blue is the Hottest Color\")",

I am watching movies since the latest 30 years and I have to say ; This movie is special !! After 30 years of seeing all kind of movies I have narrowed my scope of movies to see. They have to be special, show me something different, give me ideas to think about or to evaluate in my own life. So, movies like World war Z is not directly my style. This movie although is one of the best love stories I have seen. No unnecessary emotional or cuteness parts, each part of the story is real and genius. It is the soft moments of a love story, the hard moments bringing to the screen. The movie is made in away you are in the skin of Adele and Emma ( can't remember the actress names ). They take you with them in their love story, their feelings. That is also the reason that the 3 hours of the movie is not too long at all. I was surprised it took 3 hours when the film ended. The movie handles the passion between them, a passion that many of us forget over the years in a relation. That passion is also expressed in about 3 sex scenes, 3 scenes which are quiet honest and direct. Some people will find these scenes too long ( one of them could take 10 minutes ), but I find it necessary to establish your follow up of the passion they have between each other, so that when things goes worse you also are one with the situation.This movie, natural, honest about love, life and sexuality could be attended by children of 12 and more, if they are explained things of life ( they also can see all kind of war movies \u0085 ). Many will say \"Oh, lesbian movie, what the hell you are\". This is a movie for all of us, independent of your orientation being gay, hetero, bisexual, \u0085 It is a Love story.Each feeling, being angry / disappointment / sad / etc \u0085, can be seen on the faces of Adele and Emma and by this I have to say that these actresses are just superb, in fact I don't know another word to say extraordinary acting. It has certainly been very difficult for them to make this film. The director : Bravo to him.There are some scenes which are just fantastic : The first meeting between them, the encounter between them in the lesbian bar in which Adele is in a strange world as adolescent. The tree scene, where they actually get in love both of them. The level of a good love story with all it's feelings and situations has been raised to a higher one. Who can ever do this better.And the last remark. The film treats the love story, it's personal problems, the passion, but does not handle the problems which can have their family or friends, not in detail.And now, go and watch it !",

I'm just an ordinary movie-goer but if you gave me the scissors I'm asking for I could make either a decent movie about sexual identity or some artistic pornography.

            "content": "Blue is the Warmest Color (2013) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Controversial French film about a teenage Adele (Adele Exarchopoulos) whose life begins to change when she starts a relationship with Emma (Lea Seydoux). There's really no point in going into great details about the plot. Let's just say that we see Adele's life from her high school days and through a period of years where her thoughts on life and relationships certainly change. This here is a pretty good drama at best but I'm going to admit that there's really nothing here in the story that we haven't seen several times before. Yes, it's hard to make an original story these days but I think the drama of life, relationships and families that's on display here, while entertaining, really aren't anything that new. With that said, the two lead performances are among the best that you're ever going to see and by the time the movie was over I was simply in love with both actresses. Exarchopoulos does a masterful job in the role of Adele and what was so amazing to me is how complex and wide the performance is. She's given a lot of different emotions that she has to display and it was rather remarkable watching here because it almost felt like you were watching a documentary on a real person. She has to play a naive teenager, a confused adult and various other things and she's simply flawless. Seydoux also deserves a lot of credit as she's equally impressive with the more worldly character. The two together are just so raw and passionate that it's certainly one of the most memorable couples in recent times. As for the controversy, the sex scenes are certainly quite graphic, loud, in your face and erotic. I must say that while the scenes were quite memorable, at the same time I couldn't help but think they really took away from the rest of the film and especially once you get to the third or fourth graphic scene. It almost seems like they were in the picture just to give people something to talk about so that the film could gain more attention. The sex scenes are certainly what got people into the theater and I guess we can be thankful because they're going to get to see two masterful performances. BLUE IS THE WARMEST COLOR isn't going to appeal to many due to its graphic nature but those willing to sit through it will certainly be rewarded.",

I read a review of the film that said something along the lines of, \"the trouble with this film being 3 hours is that you want to watch it for several more.\" I couldn't agree more with that statement. The story, along with its characters, moves the film along to the point where it didn't feel like 3 hours. This film was probably the most emotionally intense and powerful movie I've seen in a very long time. You believed everything you were seeing and it forced you to feel it along with the characters. As much that has been written about this film, the acting can not be overstated. These two actresses are a revelation in this movie. It seems that whenever the topic of homosexuality is covered by a film it usually contains some sort of hate crime or bias against homosexuality somewhere in the story that the film's characters have to face and overcome. What's refreshing about this film is that there is a dash of that but its in the beginning of the film and never becomes the focus of the conflict with the characters. The film acknowledges that bias is there but brushes it aside to say that there is something bigger and more important at play with the characters. Really nice to see that in a film.This movie ranks as one of the best films I've seen this year and am so happy I had a chance to see it.",

And they certainly wouldn't be comfortable with Adele's emerging lesbianism.Enter Emma, a blue-haired artist, a few years older than Adele, who develops a passionate relationship with the younger girl and exposes her to a bohemian life of gallery openings attended by the intelligentsia. Adele is slavishly devoted to Emma, even as we begin to notice Emma becoming a bit too critical of Adele's philistinism and drops comments here and there about how Adele could improve herself. Finally, an event occurs which Emma uses as an excuse to break things off with Adele, crushing the younger woman and introducing her to her first taste of heartbreak.Over the course of three hours, \"Blue Is the Warmest Color\" explores the dynamics of this relationship in meticulous detail, and it's something to behold. It dives into the intensity of human emotions with an unflinching camera reminiscent of a John Cassavetes movie. It's a bit exhausting (like Cassavettes) and also a bit frustrating, mainly because Adele, who's practically in every scene, is frustrating herself. But she's frustrating in a way people are in real life. Do you know that person who's loving and kind but just never seems happy and doesn't seem to know what it is that would make her happier? That's Adele. You want to see good things happen to her, but after a while you kind of just want to be away from her because her discomfort with herself begins to rub off like a stain.Typically, debate about this movie has centered around the graphic sex scenes between Adele and Emma, which reduces the movie to a titillating mainstream porno when it's anything but. It explores the ways in which people impact each other, for both good and bad, and not just sexually. It's an excellent film, and the ending implies that there will be a follow up to it continuing Adele's story.Grade: A",

If you don't want him, I'll take him Adele!). I thought this was very firmly established, so then why is she supposedly hooking up with a guy later on because she feels \"lonely\"? I thought being with men didn't fulfill anything in her? But she's with a man later on because she feels lonely? I wouldn't have a problem with this had the first act not contradicted this.

            "content": "To put it in as simple terms as possible, Blue Is The Warmest Colour is a story about Ad\u00e8le, a high school student who finds herself confused and troubled with her sexual identity. After passing a blue-haired girl on the street who catches her eye and an even more confusing, spontaneous and upsetting encounter with a classmate she finds it all to curious and enticing when a close, male friend takes her to a gay bar, she follows some girls to another bar nearby where she sees the blue- haired girl again. A short conversation sparks a relationship that carries us through the rest of the film.Well, where to start?To start with, this film is exhaustingly long. 3 hours is too much for so much useless, meandering exposition. It serves nothing other than to keep us away from a plot that is so thin you could go make yourself a cup of tea and come back 20 minutes later and nothing would've happened to push the story along. I'm sure there is an excellent 90 minute film in there somewhere if the editors had been more ruthless in their cutting and the director wasn't so preposterously self indulgent.The sex scenes are unavoidable, exploitative and sickening within the context of the films creation. The major sex scene that everyone talks about took a gruelling 10 days to shoot and was only the actors 2nd shot on-set together, they literally didn't know each other and were suddenly put together to perform these scenes for an imposing, frustrated director.L\u00e9a Seydoux and Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos have both stated that the 3 hour film doesn't really show how much they shot, that the director would do hundreds of takes of even the most simple scenes, extend scenes and shoot for extremely long periods of time and would become enraged if they laughed even once out of one hundred takes.Knowing how the actors felt about it (thankfully they have been vocal in interviews about how horrible and unpleasant the experience was) how uncomfortable they were with unchoreographed sex scenes; sex scenes are almost always choreographed, shots and various angles kept to minimal length so that actors are more comfortable and that the experience is as desexualised as possible. They have spoken about how they felt powerless to say anything about it because \"The director has all the power. When you're an actor on a film in France and you sign the contract, you have to give yourself, and in a way you're trapped.\"\u0085\"In America, we'd all be in jail.\" \u2013 L\u00e9a SeydouxThis is perversion and abuse of power in the truest sense. The fact that Kechiche wrote the adaptation, produced and directed the film, apparently even financed some of it himself tells me all I need to know about his intentions. Even Manohla Dargis of The New York Times has written that it \"feels far more about Mr. Kechiche's desires than anything else\".I feel awful for L\u00e9a Seydoux and Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos for having to endure this \"horrible\" 6 month shoot and for having to work with this director, of whom they have said they would never work with again. They deserved better than this because their performances are incredible given the situation that they had to work in.And finally, I also feel bad for the characters Ad\u00e8le and Emma, their story deserved so much better than this.",

            "content": "Adele is a schoolgirl (I think). She does what French schoolgirls do. Take literature classes, eat spaghetti dinners with the family, sleep, talk with her friends about boys. One of them is interested in her. One day they end up sitting next to each other and talk. They go out on a date one day. As she goes to meet him she walks by a lesbian couple, one of them has her hair blue. Adele is captivated by this rather unattractive girl to such an extend that she almost gets run over.She ends up eating with the guy, seeing a movie, making out. Her friends tease her the next day that she had sex. On the next date they have sex. Next time she sees him she ignores him and they break up. While she sitting outside smoking, a girl sits next to her, tells her she's pretty and they kiss. Next day Adele can't wait to make out with the girl again but when she tries she is rejected. The other girls tells her she misunderstood. A male gay friend takes her to a male gay bar where everybody does nothing but make out. She feels alone and leaves to a female gay bar looking for blue haired girl. Of course she's there, they talk, exchange phone numbers. Next, Emma (that's blue) picks her up at school, that gets comments from Adele's group of friends, they go to the park, to a museum. At some point they start having sex. Next day Adele is bullied by her friends for being a potential lesbian, in a bizarre and unreal scene.Adele and Emma meet each others' parents. Time goes by. Adele moves in with Emma and meets her sophisticated friends. She feels out of place. Emma is a painter and her friends are actors and well-read folks. Emma's ex is also there. As Emma is getting ready to do an exhibition of her work she has no time for Adele, who starts feeling lonely and goes out to dance and make out with a guy. After a couple of these adventures she gets kicked out by Emma.Time goes by. Adele is now a teacher's aide or something of the sort and works with children. She still hasn't gotten over Emma for some reason. She invites her to dinner. They make out, but Emma is happy with her new/ex girlfriend and her children. Emma invites Adele to an exhibition of her work where there are nude paintings of Adele.Blue Is the Warmest Color is one pompous title that makes you think you're going to see one hell of a deep French movie. The actual title The Life of Adele is more true. All you do is witness an unspecified number of years of a girl. It's an empty three hour movie, empty like an open container though to be filled with whatever you make of it. Are you then left with fascinating characters? No. Adele is insecure, desperately needy--in need of physical affection, quiet, not very articulate nor interesting. I like characters like that. And make no mistake, despite the bizarre billing, the star here is Adele Exarchopoulos. The camera is on her for nearly the entire 3 hours. Whatever she got paid it wasn't enough for what she had to do, especially if it's true that the director was abusive on top of that. So it's downright indignant to see the other actress get top billing.What you are left with is seeing Exarchopoulos. And this movie is to be treated more like a painting of her. And she's gorgeous to see. The director and camera guy know it. Her wild hair is stunning, her lips are beautiful, her body perfect. Despite the reviews and rating, the sex scene aren't all that graphic. Sure, the poses are, and for Adele's first sex scene with a girl, she sure knows some wicked positions. But it looks like the bodies of two mannequins having sex. Even though supposedly prosthetic vaginas (vulvas?) were used you would think that prosthetic vaginas look like...vaginas. Instead, one gets the impression that body parts were digitally removed even. Unfortunately they didn't remove the erect male genitalia. But if aesthetics were the main concern of this movie they really should have hired a more attractive actress than L\u00e9a Seydoux.Without taking out a minute of the sex scenes, this movie could have been edited down to 2 hours or so easily. There is no musical score thankfully, but there are some bits of varied music- Arab, Latin, electronic, and I've never been more thankful to hear music in a movie--it's so refreshing here. And in another brilliant move by the director, we get several scenes of Adele dancing, and it looks great. At least then she does let her lovely hair down. Now those scenes should have been longer and better filmed. In fact, there should have been scenes of Adele dancing with another girl.The whole lesbian angle of this movie is a bit forced. Not to take anything away from Exarchopoulos' performance but she does have most of the time a bored and tired look on her. Rarely do you see her happy or with a genuine smile on her face, not even when she's with Emma. One can't help but think that a movie like this wins awards for political reasons. It could have been a good movie had it explored more in depth the source of Adele's loneliness and neediness. Hard to believe a girl as lovely as Adele would ever be lonely. Why doesn't she come to life or to her own once she's with Emma? Blue Is the Warmest Color doesn't have much to offer in terms of questions or answers.",

A deep diving into puberty, into the raw desires of youth, above the thunderous victory of human need. Adele is the personification of youth, just in time when it begins to grown. That exact moment when the juices of love are instantly aggressive and the human body seems like a fruit with the heart as a kernel. When you are in the midst of immortality, gaining the illusion of eternity, just before the fruit is eaten, shortly before the kernel sits at your neck with the bitter taste of rejection, while you greedily swallow life, which seems so inexhaustible.

Yes we get to know the characters more and more as the film progresses but is the story going anywhere? In my opinion - not really.The acting though was good.

The scenes in the park and the interplay of sentiments and nuances between the two lovers are very emotional and engaging. The difference of characters is very well presented.The other good point is the sometimes humoristic way in which the down to earth and pragmatic family and social environment of Adele is juxtaposed with the artistic, intellectual and avant guard family and friends of Emma. I think this is the best part of the movie when one compares the realism of Adele with the artistic license of Emma. The scenes where both eat with each others family and the ensuing dialogues are a treat.And now what you are all waiting for: the sex scenes. They are long, hot and explicit. I can not pronounce with conviction whether they served the artistic purposes of the movie or not. If someone wanted to watch the full bloom of a lesbian love story, the scenes may be considered indispensable, if you just wanted to watch a human love story between two people that happen also to have the same sex without caring for so much carnal detail, the scenes could be shorter and more circumspect. The point nevertheless is that those scenes caused a sensation and created a furore and debate from which the movie profited in terms of advertisement. People may now blame or praise it for the wrong reasons.Both actresses where very good in playing their roles. The portrayal by Exarchopoulos of Adele as a teacher in a kinder-garden reading to the children didactic stories with animals or of her abilities as a cook and her insistence that Emma should eat something while Emma is consumed by a telephone call in which she raves about her artistic personality, integrity and vision ignoring Adele and the immediate environment are superb. She is also an actress which made feel empathy for her character. Seydoux is also very credible as the pretentious modernistic and ultimately self-centered Emma.

The film offers several basic and well used premises: the Eliza Doolittle/Henry Higgins: why won't you let me educate you thing, a dichotomy between big city and small city ideas and ideals and the well trotted out first love idea. However, the way this film is presented is entirely original. Kechiche sets it in Lille, a town in Northern France, full of provincial living and entirely captures how it is in general in this town - when the characters walk around you feel that he understands what he is talking about.The film is about desire, desire to eat, desire to sleep with someone, desire to dance and it is portrayed within a first relationship between two women. The two women are fantastic and the plot has amusing little french jokes interspersed between the very emotionally demanding relationship that has you gasping at points. However the story is largely about one of them, Adele - and you feel over the three hours, that you get to know her, what she is about, what she finds attractive, what she wants (or what she thinks she wants). The actress playing her has a wonderfully expressive face and she needs it for the amount that happens. When she cries, when she eats, when she sleeps you believe her.Much has been said about the sex scenes, which are very graphic, however these are entirely relevant to the plot and the furore seems to be about the actors criticising the director for pushing them too far, however, without this pushing this film wouldn't be nearly as good. When it finished, and I realised that it had been three hours I couldn't believe it.It was a revelation.",

            "content": "I am hard pressed to fault Blue Is the Warmest Color. My appreciation of it crescendoed in a way that had me question the essentiality of the entire 45 minutes or so before Ad\u00e8le and Emma meet. I nonetheless have come to appreciate it as the deliberate development of the Ad\u00e8le character and her circumstances. The walk-by and subsequent autoerotic scene are integral to the story.I also questioned whether the protracted graphic sexual content was of an artistically neutral value, given how lust can otherwise be implied. Not that filmmakers should necessarily make a habit of it, but with so little left to the imagination, the right emotional responses were more readily evoked in other scenes. Ultimately, the film's unfailing naturalism demanded such sexual representations. It would not have made sense for the director to have been shy about the kind of film he was making.Ad\u00e8le is an understandably flawed character. Her sex life is dictated more by convenience than principle. This selfishness is at variance with her love for Emma and desire to benefit others as a teacher. Emma is more mature in age and mind. She is a truly likable character. Loving her so deeply is a credit to Ad\u00e8le. One of the more thought provoking relationships ever put to the screen; I would need a horrendous case of dementia to forget it.What a breakup scene! Not surprisingly the most difficult; it best exemplifies this tour de force of acting for the two leads. I could rack my brains to no end and not recall to mind a more effective scene. Ad\u00e8le receives her comeuppance with heartrending disbelief and desperation. Emma's Sartrean resolution can be debated on its merits.The taboo nature of their relationship is something of an eye-opener. France only legalized same-sex marriage in 2013, despite nationwide opposition. So, the depiction of homophobia is all too true, evidently. There is something wrong in the world we live in when a realistic treatment of the subject would have been essentially the same decades earlier.This glowing review of mine had me call into question my own rating. It had been a 9/10, mainly because the film by necessity (as I now understand) has an unusually slow build up. I had intended for this to be a mixed review, but the more I meditate on Blue Is the Warmest Color, the more I appreciate it. The perceived negatives fell flat under the light of scrutiny. The supporting characters are well established, with Samir, the Arabic speaking actor as the standout. The music is good throughout. The anti-Hollywood, though somewhat open-ended ending is just right.All in all, a brilliant, intense, and wonderfully unique film.",

Almost every emotion the face can show is expressed by the leading actress: longing, satisfaction, shame, allure, hunger, anger, grief, boredom, suspicion. I was worried after the opening scenes that the film was one of stark realism despite its whimsical title. However, after a short time, it took on its poetical style, and in the street, just before Adele sees Emma, we hear the first sound of music. From then on the film is an exercise in cinematic eloquence. In one particular scene, Adele wanders into a lesbian club still under the impression of the blue-haired woman she had seen days or weeks before. The club is small and packed and she can't seem to find her bearings. Adele makes it to the back of the club which resembles a dark abyss. She has the look of someone at once desperately searching and giving up the search. Then, behind her, the top of Emma's head appears from somewhere out of the shadows as a looming orb of dark blue. You don't see where Emma comes from; you don't see her face or body, just a color. When Emma sits down at the bar with Adele their first exchange is instantly dynamic and absorbing. If you compare this conversation with the talk Adele engages in with her classmates at the beginning , it's easy to admit that Adele is far more mature, thoughtful, and intellectually eager than her peers. To appreciate the subtleties of this scene we have to recall one of the first moments in the film when Adele's teacher asked her class if love at first sight feels like the gaining of something or the losing of something. Is it possible that the director is also trying to answer this question? The sex scenes will doubtlessly make some uncomfortable; such authenticity is something rarely seen on screen, but they are neither gratuitous nor pornographic. There's nothing more gratuitous than the old lie that's been told throughout cinematic history of woman as a passive sexual being, and the women in this film are anything but passive. Contrary to other reviews, no single sex scene in Blue is 10 minutes long. There are three sex scenes and together they add up to 10 minutes, but the scene everyone is talking about is at most five minutes, unless the film they showed at Cannes if different from the one making the film festival circuit.",

It begins with a high school teenager (or as they're now called in the US \"young adult\"). This is Ad\u00e8le (Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos, who was probably 18 when the movie was filmed). She's shy and confused about sex and love. In her literature class there's a discussion on first love and the possibility of instant love, or love at first sight. It turns out these insights are prescient for her although she doesn't know it at the time. She's kind of interested in boys and her HS female chums are urging her on to have sex with a guy. But a chance encounter with a female classmate on the school steps sparks a curiosity in her that she just possibly wants a relationship with a woman.By chance she catches sight of Emma (L\u00e9a Seydoux, who was probably 26 when the movie was filmed). Emma's an art student with dyed-blue hair. At the beginning of the movie, Ad\u00e8le acts like a typical teenager, gauche, insecure, unsure of who she is sexually. A gay male classmate takes her to a gay male bar and she soon locates a gay lesbian bar and finds Emma, or rather, lets Emma find her. Their relationship has the intensity, fire, and poignancy of first love, and for Ad\u00e8le Emma's the love of her life.But Emma has other needs, and takes up with a pregnant woman, Lise. Ad\u00e8le feels deserted by Emma and begins sleeping with a male colleague out of loneliness and abandonment. There's a blowout fight between Ad\u00e8le and Emma, with Emma throwing Ad\u00e8le out. She's devastated. The rest of the movie follows Ad\u00e8le as she tries to get over Emma. They meet in a small restaurant where Ad\u00e8le tearfully tells Emma that she (Ad\u00e8le) still loves her. And as the movie ends it's obvious Ad\u00e8le still remains deeply in love with Emma but has reconciled herself to simply be friends with her.I take issue with several of the reviewers on this site who left reviews that the sexual lovemaking in this movie is slutty disgusting pornographic trash. I strongly disagree. The portrayal of the sexual lovemaking is very intense and realistic (some reviewers on this site thought otherwise regarding the realism but I disagree). To me it accurately portrays two human beings, both young, in passionate love. The sex of the two human beings is irrelevant. After almost fifty years many people still have significant issues with explicit sexual scenes. I did not find the sexual lovemaking in this movie to be in any way pornographic. If scenes of frank sexual intimacy and lovemaking are offensive to a person, then they shouldn't see this movie.The acting was well done and convincing. However, I would have retained the original title of the movie--The Life of Ad\u00e8le--because that's exactly what it is: the story of Ad\u00e8le and her first true love.",

The three hours will simply fly by as you follow the life of Adele who falls in love with an arty student . The lead actress is stunning in both looks and believability , and you are swept along with her on her journey . This is acting on the edge...powerful and dramatic...worthy of many awards . The story rattles along at pace , and hardly has time to fully explore all the issues that are on show . Adeles family and friends for example simply disappear after a while , which was odd , as they were an important part of the anti-lesbian feeling present early on in the film . Nonetheless , its almost impossible to find fault . I didn't shed a tear at any stage (but came close a few times ) . The now infamous sex scenes were in my opinion incredibly moving and central to the plot (however they were rather long...men will be used more to a \"Wham Bam 30 seconds approach \" ! ) You should all go to see this ...male and female alike...though perhaps don't take your Mother !",

At the Q&A afterward with Kechiche, Seydoux and Exarchopoulos, I learned that they shot some of the takes 100 times!His methods are unconventional. Because of this you are able to experience cinema in a whole new light. The acting was so real, so moving; these actresses gave everything they had, I'm just blown away with what I viewed. My hat is off to Exarchopoulos and Seydoux as actresses. No matter how painful and difficult the process must of been to make this movie in the end I think that they would have to agree it was worth it.

            "review_title": "A Palm D'Or?",
            "content": "I will begin with the positives:I appreciate that this film deals with sexuality and presents an exploration of love, the self and and understanding of one's own identity through the character of Adele. - I appreciate the strong female roles, and female leads both played by strong female actresses.What didn't work: - All the references to Sartre, Egon Schiele, Klimt, French Literature, Kubrick, Scorcese, Buena Vista Social Club poster on Adele's bedroom wall, there were way too many cultural references in the script that were a bit pretentious and too \"on the nose\" and that felt like the Screenwriters/Directors thoughts and beliefs vs. those that help push the story forward in a way that is creative and/or innovative.the Editing was terrible. The film is 3hrs long. And let me tell you this is NO Spartakus and no Lawrence of Arabia and no Gone with the Wind, so by an 1hr45 people in the theater were already getting antsy and some even getting up and leaving. This same exact story could have easily been told in under 2hrs. A 3hr movie only shows the inexperience of the Editor or the self indulgence of the Director. The editing was so sloppy that in a classroom scene where Adele is dictating sentences to the first graders we see a shot of the back of her brown dress and for a good 5 seconds we see a microphone strapped to the back of her dress. Another scene that needed editing was the first sex scene between Adele and Emma; i don't mind that it was graphic and borderline porn, that's fine, it was just so long that by the time it transitioned into the next scene you forgot you were watching something other than lesbian porn at a mainstream movie theater. Another sign that this scene should have been shorter was when people in the audience started laughing after a while, it was beautiful and graphic but after 5 minutes of two women having sex it stops being interesting (another example of the Director's self-indulgence, or inability to cut). the overuse of the color blue. Corny. And...it's been done. In Alfonso Cuaron's 1998 film Great Expectations he utilizes the color Green for the entire set, costumes, except for those of Lustig (played by Robert De Niro). Like in Cuaron's film, in Blue is the Warmest Color, Abdellatif Kechiche has the main character wear the color blue almost throughout the entire film. But while all of her bedroom furniture is blue, and she is attracted to the girl with the \"blue\" hair, it's more gimmecky than it is powerful in terms of story-telling.the sets/Production Design was unbelievable and cheap. Adele's bedroom, other than just being painted blue (what a surprise), had barely any decorations, other than a few postcards on the walls and a poster of Buena Vista Social Club. The Cafe where Adele and Emma meet near the end looks like a set rather than an actual bar or coffee shop. the music also felt ill-fitting and out of place for the story. Though Adele says (in the dialogue) that she listens to all kinds of music \"everything except heavy rock/metal\", but yet, we get mostly salsa and Cuban Timba. I am Cuban and I love Cuban music, but i also love film, and in order for a film to be good, the audience has to \"buy the choices that the characters make\" otherwise it isn't believable, having only Cuban music was a choice that felt forced, as if there was an outside voice imposing this music onto the character, rather than the character choosing it for herself. I didn't buy it.Also in the Cafe scene near the end when Adele comes on to Emma. As desperate as she is in that moment, I also didn't buy it. Something that intimate would happen in the bathroom, or outside near an ally, by a car, not in a crowded bar/cafe. It too felt like a forced moment and it took me out of the \"reality\" of the story. I am very surprised it won the Palm D'Or for 2013. I saw the list of Runner Ups, and while I have not seen all of them, this one is not better than most, in fact, it's less than mediocre when compared to some of the sloppier \"Sundance-y\" movies made this year.",

            "content": "\"La vie d'Ad\u00e8le\" or \"Blue Is the Warmest Color\" manages something that most films do not manage. It runs for roughly 3 hours, but there is hardly any moment when you feel that the film begins to drag. I cannot think of a single scene I would cut. The Cannes jury probably felt the same and thus awarded the two protagonists. Especially Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos, not a complete newcomer to acting but she had her great breakthrough here, had me glued to the screen and she would have deserved the Academy Award nomination that she probably was not too far away from. Using her real name for the film title and the character also shows that it has become a very personal movie for her. If Ad\u00e8le was not a fictional character, this film was certainly in the race for best biopic of 2013.I won't say too much about the struggles and conflicts between the two actresses and the director as I am not sure how credible both accounts were and to which extent they just used the headlines to further promote the movie. In any case the final output, namely the movie, has become a piece of art, great character development and the sex scenes are very artistic. You never feel like watching porn. One of my favorite scenes was watching Ad\u00e8le's struggles with Emma's life and how she just did not fit in with her friends etc. Failure seems unavoidable. The scenes at the school were also very well done when we witness how Ad\u00e8le slowly discovers her true sexuality and all the obstacles (including a fellow student who just wants to try out stuff) she runs into during the process, the denying, the lying etc.Other than that, you could always keep the English title in mind while watching this film. Keep an eye on all the different ways the color blue is used. It is far more than Emma's hair. One scene worth mentioning would be the final meeting of the two. It is kinda sad to see how Ad\u00e8le still clings to Emma and her relationship and the passion and emotion they had, while from Emma's side all the fire was gone. In the past they argued as strongly as they loved each other. Not anymore. Emma still hasn't found it again either with her new woman, but she chooses the path of stability and congruence over what her heart possibly tells her. Of course the blue hair is a significant standout in the film too. Already during their first meeting, when they both turn their heads, it stays in mind and it's one of the most defining factors in Ad\u00e8le's first fantasy about Emma.For me, personally I would say that I hoped they would get together, but I am nonetheless glad the director was not going for a forced happy end just to satisfy the audience. The ending he chose was probably more realistic and I applaud Kechiche for that. If there was anything that I did not like about the film it may have been Ad\u00e8le's cheating on Emma. Even if she felt neglected, their relationship still seemed very intense and I thought it just did not fit, especially not with a male at that point of having developed her sexual orientation.Finishing this review by saying that these were some of most delicious spaghetti I have ever seen on screen. Oh and the music was great too, but that is almost a given with French films these days. Congrats to everybody involved. Great movie.",

            "review_title": "Excellent dissection of ill-fated romance between two young women still needs paring down",
            "content": "Okay I'm generalizing, but in so many cases, If you're looking for an intense film about relationships, French films trump American ones, because the French just seem inherently to be the experts when it comes to love and passion. French-Tunisian director Abdellatif Kechiche's intimate dissection of a romance between two young women is no exception. His film won the Palme d'Or, the top award at the Cannes Film Festival. This was the first time a director and two actresses collectively received the award\u2014by a panel led by such film industry luminaries as Steven Spielberg, Nicole Kidman and director Ang Lee. The film features a smashing performance by Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos who has the same first name as the film's protagonist. When we first meet Ad\u00e8le, she's a high school student confused about her sexual identity. She sees a young blue haired woman on the streets and has dreams about her. Prodded by her gossipy classmates, she has a brief, unsatisfactory relationship with a boy, but soon breaks up with him after an encounter with a female classmate, who first kisses her on the steps outside of the school. The female classmate tells her that she wasn't serious about the encounter but Ad\u00e8le is taken to a gay bar by a male gay friend but she soon wanders off to a lesbian bar, where she meets the blue-haired woman she had seen out on the streets earlier.The young blue-haired woman is Emma (played by an equally intense L\u00e9a Seydoux), an older art graduate student. They begin a steamy affair, culminating in a series of explicit sex scenes which has garnered quite a bit of publicity for the film. The second Act occurs after a passage of time\u2014now Emma is trying to break into the art world as a professional artist and Ad\u00e8le has begun a job as a kindergarten teacher. Director Kechiche pulls out all the stops in depicting the burgeoning romance between the two women. The problem with much of it is that it's just too drawn out. That not only includes the sex scenes but other scenes such as when the each women meets one another's parents (Emma's upper middle class parents know that she's gay and are immediately accepting of Ad\u00e8le; but Ad\u00e8le's lower middle-class parents are left in the dark as to the nature of their relationship). Mr. Kechiche can't resist closeups of each character discussing how much they enjoy the pasta they're eating. Another earlier scene, where Emma and Ad\u00e8le engage in a long intellectual discussion about Sartre and other sundry topics on a park bench, also seems to go on and on.But I was grudgingly willing to put up with the incredibly drawn out spectacle to see what the final outcome of the relationship was between the two lovers. Before the final blowup, cracks in the facade of the relationship, begin to emerge. Ad\u00e8le, working much more simply with children, begins to feel out of place in Emma's more sophisticated world of art professionals. Finally, with Emma spending more time in the art world, Ad\u00e8le has a brief fling with a guy, a fellow male co- worker from her job at the school. . Emma finally figures out that Ad\u00e8le has been cheating on her and she flips out. She throws Ad\u00e8le out of her house and tells she never wants to see her again. I like how Emma was depicted in the scene where she dumps Ad\u00e8le, as her lack of flexibility and unwillingness to forgive the vulnerable Ad\u00e8le, showed her to be cold and overly controlling. In other words, there's a multi-dimensionality to the character.The rest of the film I would say is anti-climactic. Some years pass and Ad\u00e8le spends a good deal of time by herself, trying to get over her relationship with Emma, but not quite doing so. She finally meets with Emma after quite a bit of time has gone by, who ostensibly has forgiven her. Ad\u00e8le attempts to force herself on Emma in a restaurant but Emma is now committed to another woman and rejects her. Flash forward again\u2014 Emma invites Ad\u00e8le to her art exhibition, where Ad\u00e8le finally accepts the fact that Emma has moved on. Her run in with the actor (who's now a real estate agent) doesn't seem to go anywhere.'Blue' is a three hour movie but it probably could have been more effective with 45 minutes of less footage. I wonder if the sex scenes were pared down, the film would have garnered as much publicity as it did. The end of filming was not the end to the controversy. Not only did union members complain about director Kechiche over working them but Exarchopoulos and Seydoux indicated that they never wanted to work with Kechiche again as they indicated that he treated them roughly while shooting the film.. Seydoux went as far as saying that she felt like a \"prostitute\" during the film shoot. Kechiche was offended by his actors' comments and at one point was quoted as saying that he hoped the film would not be released. There was also talk that Kechiche was going to sue Seydoux for her comments.Probably both parties overreacted. Exarchopoulos and Seydoux knew what kind of film they were getting into, when they signed the contract to act in it and they probably should have known Kechiche was a perfectionist. On the other hand, Kechiche perhaps should have taken into account his actors' sensibilities and directed them a little more gently.All in all, 'Blue is the warmest color', is a well-made film which captures the intensity of the intense relationship between two young women, who ultimately were not right for each other. The film needed to flow better and the editing was just not there. If you're willing to put up with the film's overall length, you will still be rewarded with some phenomenal acting and intense dissection of a relationship that ran its course.",

            "content": "Maybe it's the hype. Hype always builds up your expectations. And the more you allow your expectations to build up, they're likely to be disappointed. But in the case of 'La vie d'Ad\u00e8le', I'm pretty sure that this is not all to it, since I watched it with a Lesbian friend. And while it left me - a gay man in his 40s - totally indifferent, she hated it. This was supposed to be my 'save-the-best-for-last' movie of the year. Now it's pretty much my stinker of the year. Sure, I've watched far worse movies in 2013. I just haven't watched anything which disappointed me to such an extent.We spent a couple of hours after the film discussing just what we didn't like about it. For her, the answer was easy because she owns the graphic novel by Julie Maroh on which it's based. I've read it meanwhile and understand her reservations. The book follows Ad\u00e8le's diary and is therefore more introspective and emotional than the film. The reader gets a better idea how much time passes. The characters are drawn as normal women, decidedly less pretty than the actresses. The ending is completely different, much more tragical and hard-hitting - it's a mystery to me why Kechiche decided to change the story to such an extent.And the sex in the book is - lyrical, that being what infuriated my friend most about the film. According to her, all that humping and moaning is just what she expected a straight male director to come up with - a fantasy of what Lesbian sex is like. Only women would get it right, like Donna Deitch in the classic 'Desert Hearts', or Lisa Cholodenko in 'High Art', or Kimberly Peirce in 'Boys don't cry'. The author Julie Maroh expressed a similar criticism, describing the sex scene as ridiculous.I understand these frustrations since what I halfway expected to be a Lesbian 'Weekend', i.e. a film that takes the sensationalism out of gay sex and focuses on love, highlights the sex to push for controversy / interest with straight audiences. That's the only explanation I find for giving both female leads the best actress award at Cannes, even though Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos has about three times as much screen time. People think it's courageous to show gay sex, so nobody cares if that depiction is actually accurate. Saying that the film expresses how natural gay sex is doesn't really help when you're gay - since we know that already, thank you very much.Then again, the film won the Palme d'Or clearly for political reasons, since at the time there was a highly embarrassing campaign against gay marriage in France. So maybe homosexuals still have to welcome the lesser of two evils, condescending sympathy over pseudo-religious ignorance or downright hatred - but oh what a depressing thought that is. When such a thing happens to me - hearing 'watching that and that film made me totally understand that being gay is normal' - I'd like to respond 'that's like telling a black person you've seen '12 Years a Slave' and now understand what it means to be black'. But I don't because people who get this wouldn't make such remarks in the first place. They'd already understand that film is always an interpretation of reality, never reality itself.However, my indifference to the film is more based on liking Kechiche's previous film 'Black Venus' a whole lot more. It showed all the ugliness of typical European racism (the 'scientific' kind), being about a Herero woman in the 19th century who is at first turned into a circus attraction, then an object of study, and finally - inevitably - a prostitute. What made this film so great was that it wasn't as much about a black woman stoically suffering her fate, but us Europeans with our ongoing tendency to categorize and thereby control all things foreign - the exact opposite of this film, where the spectator sees everything through Ad\u00e8le's eyes, so if you don't buy into her views, you lose the movie (or the movie loses you). All of this doesn't make 'La vie d'Ad\u00e8le' a bad film, it's still a strong love story owing to the source material, but I can't help but wonder what so many people see in it. The performances may be intense, but they're not convincing if you've been in its character's shoes - and according to the actresses' statements it would seem that their intensity owes a lot to the director's erratic on-set behavior. Maybe if you don't watch many European films, or have never seen a Lesbian-themed film before, you can end up being taken so aback by the sex scenes - which, credit where credit is due, are carefully embedded in the story - that you'll go 'wow'. But if you're a cineast, if you know French film, if you know the LGBT film canon, or if you're just plain gay, then you can't help but wonder what all the fuss is about - and if the wonderful graphic novel wouldn't have turned out far more impressive, had it been adapted by a woman instead.",

The coloring book mini plots to fill in any old context to shoot another frustrated porn scene of high school girl scissoring (what a straight man might imagine girls having sex do). And apparently the actresses said the director was horrible to work with and he threatened to sue the young actresses. Is that 10 lines yet?",

I blame the camera being in extreme close-up of faces all the time. The actors' every facial reaction marked, and yet I'm still not at all convinced by the romance. A film about a high school girl, so fifteen or sixteen then, who is sexually confused. Her friends have a go at her, like high school angst isn't boring enough.

There are not too many lesbian films where no one dies, goes back to men, or goes insane at the end. We WANTED to add this to the tiny list of films that we enjoy that depict relationships that look like ours. And we can't. I hate this film because it betrayed my expectations. I wish I hadn't built up my hopes so much. But enough of my dashed dreams, on to the problems.Problems: 1) Adele goes back to a man, cause her girlfriend isn't blah blah blah blah. Congratulations, we have stereotype number one! All men assume that lesbians go back to men! Can I start assuming that all men go back to men after they date a horrible woman? 2) What the hell was with the obsession with Spaghetti? I admit, I stopped watching after hour one. I did the dishes, I wandered around the house, I closed my eyes for a cat nap, but EVERY time I looked at the screen someone was shoveling spaghetti in their mouths. I wish the director would just address his deep, dark desire to film tentacle porn and stop pussyfooting with the spaghetti. 3) What do you want to know after Adele gets thrown out of the house for cheating? Do you, as a vaguely interested party, want to see how her family reacts? They've been pretty blas\u00e9 about the whole lesbian thing so far. Don't you want to know how her family supports her, if they support her, if they say, \"So how about that guy you screwed? Is he relationship material?\" All these questions will be IGNORED by the film so that you can watch Adele wander around her kindergarten room moping. Because watching this girl mope for the last two hours hasn't been enough! This is not the only incident where the director made a clear and conscious decision to ignore the interesting parts of a human drama to focus on moping, but I simply cannot dredge through my memory to think of all the others.4) Of course we were ready for some amazing sex cause everybody was talking about it! Halfway through the interminable scene, I put on the the YouTube reaction video of a Cuban grandma watching the sex scene. She was more genuine. 5) Obsession 2: Butts! Statue butts, girls' butts. Everyone else noticed this. I'm not going to dwell. 6) No lesbians do not attempt to f*ck each other in restaurants. Sure, just like heterosexual couples, there may be some bathroom sex here and there, but for god's sake! WHO attempts to finger bang their girlfriend in a restaurant??? That was so awful. 7) Lesbians react to Blue is the Warmest Color Sex Scenes said it best: there's nothing new about guys paying straight women to f*ck each other. Good points: I'm sorry, I just can't think of any.",

Once we painfully get through the beginning of the film, things finally pick up a little. Unfortunately after watching the slow relationship build, and take place, the movie then crumbles into a depressing ending. The move does not make you feel good at the end. If anything it feels exhausting to watch the main character suffer through everything to just end up where she ends up.I did hear that one of the major appeals to the film was the graphic lesbian sex, but honestly, I've seen better. It feels very staged and its missing emotion. There's lots of sex in the movie, which is nice, and might appeal to a man's eyes. But watching the movie as a woman, there needs to be more emotion in it.I think too, because the movie is a forign french film, it does get exhausting reading subtitles throughout the entire movie.",

I went to see a 90 minute feature of Abdelatif Kechiche. In my mind it certainly was going to be a 90 minute feature. When I went out of the theater I noticed missed calls on my mobile phone. It was 3 hours and I have missed an appointment. But it's well worth it.There is a change, a drastic change in what the director has done. It moves from wider frames to a tight style. Yet the wide screen is well filled and never had the feeling of empty space. The colors are sublime. The time frame is artsy marked. Yet something is missing. Reading after the fact about the movie I see he employed professional and known actors. And this is another departure from his movies. He moves from his work with European minorities to a story about the white majority. Sure, it's about a sexual minority, but the people are still well integrated into their society, they do have a place to go when things to out of hand.Than Mr. Kechiche moves from a social and personal drama of his personages to an intimate drama. And the violence is very convincing, but intimacy is somehow distant. There is nudity, quite a lot, but eroticism lacks. For someone who is used to main steam puritan American sexy movie, two young female bodies rubbing against each other can be even disturbing. For me it looks mechanical. Maybe that was all he could get from his two rather hostile stars. I assume a rather orthodox upbringing, so the director's sexual norms interfere with the story. As with Nuri Ceylan, the women are wonderfully drawn. Yet the males are usually boys and only sketchy. That can't be considered a minus in this precise story until you get that Adele is, in fact, bisexual so the boys should have more substance. The fact they are only in passage, compared with her love and passion for Emma, should point out her preference.I'd go as far as saying it's the worst Kechiche movie. Because late that night I was certain he was desperately looking for something. I don't know what that something is. But there is a very short, almost home made, scene with Adele watched voyeurish from outside her home, as the scenes with her returning to her parents' home. But that does not fit very well with the close, tight frame from the rest. Also, this movie made me thing about Akira Kurosawa saying eating on screen is disgusting. Adele is pictured as a pig. Why? A dislike for sexual young women? For the life in the well fed suburbs? I am so clich\u00e9 when thinking of that. Of framing Abdelatif Kechiche in the deep Parisian ghetto. I am sorry for that. But also lost.Still, it's an excellent movie. Probably the best seen this year, and I don't usually watch new movies the year they come out.Contact me with Questions, Comments or Suggestions ryitfork @ bitmail.ch",

I have been a lesbian my whole life (I am 47 now) and have had my share of sex... never once have I been in the positions they show in this movie. Women do not generally have sex with other women from behind especially in their first sexual encounter! It seems to me that SEX was the star and point of this movie.. maybe from a mans perspective? Women do not go at it like these two in the fragile beginnings of a relationship if ever. Why would a woman have oral sex from behind another woman when it is physically awkward as well as much more difficult? Women lie beside one another, on top of each other, caress, hug, touch, etc... women are usually on their back (the one receiving). Only a man would put a woman's face up in another woman's ass to perform oral sex. The whole practice of using fingers was also lost on this. Scissoring is also uncommon and most lesbians only engage in this (if ever) just for the sake of trying it after being in a long term relationship. The time line of this movie was horrible to follow! We see in the beginning that Emma was already in a relationship with another woman when she first meets Adele but we never know what happens with that. Also the last relationship with the pregnant woman is confusing. At the art exhibit we see that Emma has paintings of the pregnant women while she was still pregnant which hints that she was intimate with her while she was with Adele. So, twice it appears as though Emma has cheated yet, she ends the relationship with Adele for cheating, calling her a slut, etc? Also, I didn't understand why there weren't any issues with regard to Adele's friend 'Valentin' who brought her to the gay bar and was also gay (or bi) himself. All the classmates harassed Adele but not him? Hard to believe and makes no sense... too many inconsistencies. This movie was way too long and missed the mark for me.. unless your looking for a mans (fantasy?) perspective on lesbian relationships this movie is nothing but a waste of time... 3 hrs I'll never get back",

This is most unusual.More seriously, though, this film explores class divisions, subtly injects communism, and brings out the fluidity of sexuality. The film has been both praised and criticized for its sex scenes, which are among the most explicit ever put in film (far surpassing \"The Brown Bunny\"). But more interesting than its portrayal of sex is its portrayal of sexuality, refusing to commit to any firm homosexual or heterosexual boundaries.We also have the color blue as a running theme, being both the symbol of sadness, but also the signifier of love and passion.

I mean 3 hours for that plot - Lawrence of Arabia took only 30 minutes more and Gone With The Wind is just one hour longer... Well, I guess I'm too old to fall for a story about teenage-angst, the discovering of one's own sexuality, first love and so on and on. At least the sex scenes are well shot, which means they are no porn or look in any way cheap.

I guess \"Blue\" gets mostly all the praise because it's p.c., and there is always a great audience available cuz there are always a lot of teenagers eager to watch a movie about teenage-angst and coming of age. But the real ground-shaking stuff for me are all the scenes in the schoolroom - a full blast of realism here! All the pictures and memories hitting me straight!

It's marketed as realistic, wrenching love story about two women; I was hopeful that such a movie would be somewhat female centric in it's point of view. I was wrong. This is a movie for men by men. It is replete with beautiful young women who are (surprise surprise) extremely sexual. There are many shots of the main character's backside (in jeans, in pants, in a dress) as she walks away from the camera which feel highly objectifying and gratuitous. The sex scenes (featuring one party masturbation as well as two party lovemaking) are terribly unrealistic and likely represent the director's fantasy of what a woman's sexuality is like.I want to talk about the main character for a bit. Adele is frankly not believable as a lesbian. I know people are going to take issue with my saying this (how exactly does one \"appear\" like a lesbian...) but movies are made with some consideration of casting in mind. Characters have to look like the part that they are playing. Adele resembles a male fantasy; traditionally feminine. The contrast between Adele and other, more believable, lesbians is apparent when she ventures into a lesbian bar for the first time. In addition, I kept wondering if Adele was suffering some sort of delay in her intellectual functioning or traumatic brain injury. She eats like a five year old, cries like a 3 year old; she is sexual in public places; she is constantly putting things in her mouth (the scene in the caf\u00e9 close to the end of the movie is laughable); her mouth is perpetually open and her eyes have an unfocused dumb quality. I suppose this is charming coming from a beautiful young woman and may contribute (sadly) to her being seen as sexually arousing to men; however, if we were to imagine an older person conducting themselves this way, one would have to consider the diagnosis of dementia.Despite all the talk of female sexuality in this film, there is little that has to do with women or love. I look back on all of the positive reviews and recall that they were mostly written by men. Put two very attractive, very young women in a movie, include many close-up shots of them, and all of a sudden, this is passed off as a wondrous artistic feat, rather than a lazy effort to cater to the lowest common denominator. The fact that the two leading actresses were awarded the Palme d'Or is preposterous. Even more so because the only other female to win the Palme d'Or is Jane Campion, a film-maker of a totally different caliber. Women could go see this movie to be reminded of how men think. Or they could simply stay home and Google \"two women\" or watch a robin thicke music video. I should end this review by disclosing that I am female.",

Someone else has said there's a total of 30 minutes of sex scenes; well, if that's correct its about 20 minutes too much. The sex scenes are gratuitous and become an over indulgence. For large parts of the film nothing happens, for example, there are a number of scenes where Adele is teaching - these add nothing to the plot. Prior to this we see her go on student marches, nothing of significance happens. Her male friend is gay - a tired clich\u00e9! The whole of the last scene is made redundant by the scene before. Irritatingly one of the significant moments of the film is cut short - the cause of Adele having a fling with a male colleague is skipped over even though this has dire consequences.

She meets a blue-haired woman (Lea Sideaux) and they have a relationship. It has its ups and downs, and the downs are painful to watch. But the tenderness is palpable and high and as real as any modern film about frank, honest sex and companionship.The great scenes and moments are among the finest of 2013 and in modern French cinema. These actors feel natural, Adele could have a future for sure even as she seems like an ing\u00e9nue, and the direction and writing is honest in this relationship in both its erotic highs and sad, bitter lows. When it works it really works, and it doesn't put on airs for drama. If only it weren't SO long, at 187 minutes some of this could be cut down and be really great, and it mostly drags in the last hour - even the first big sex scene, not for the explicit content, God bless em all, just *feels* long here and there in the pacing. B But between this and Spectacular Now, I think there is hope for romance stories between the young at the movies, without insulting it's audience (unless a three hour movie about French lesbians turns you off right away).",

The timeline makes it a bit epic in scope, as we see her go from unassured high school student to young professional. The story is about the part this romance plays in her development. This movie is a little different in that it lets scenes go on longer than you would expect a movie to do. It has its own sense of pacing. I thought it was really sad, but moving. I really wanted things to work out for the characters. I thought it did a good job making me care about them and believing in their feelings for each other.",

            "content": "I am totally floored, flabbergasted, and struck beyond belief as to why this lesbian porno won the much coveted Palme D'Or! Either the jury was all made up of lesbians or the French LGBT took the jury to an orgy where they smoked the best pot on the planet and convinced them to vote while still high. I can't explain otherwise why this clich\u00e9 lesbian coming of age story about a woman exploring her sexuality and emotions can win the prestigious award. This film is so slow, so boring, so predictable, so has-been-done-before that it boggles the mind that someone actually thought it out, wrote it down in script format, and then convinced someone else that it was a good idea to make it into a movie, then convinced an investor to sink his money into this utterly pointless exercise in futility, a very mundane lesbian story with no redeeming qualities whatsoever.And someone should have told the director, Mr. Kechiche, that there was something called \"editing\" where you actually cut out the scenes that don't add anything to the story, like people sitting down to eat dinner every 10 minutes, and talking about stuff that is completely irrelevant to the story. Or that scenes of dancing were so tediously long, or that the love scenes are so boring and emotionless, and that I could watch much better sex on redtube. And here is a question, why did Abdellatif Kechiche make a movie about lesbians again? Is he gay or does he enjoy watching two women go at it so much that he decided to turn his fantasy into cinema? Over the past twenty years there has been a deluge of lesbian themed movies all pretty much preaching the same stuff... girl confused about her emotions, girl tries boys, girl doesn't like boys, girl tries girls, girl loves girls, girl is torn, confused, falls in love, cheats, etc, etc. The theme of this film has been done to death, and I have watched much better lesbian movies than this one that were never even shown in theaters let alone won the Palme D'Or. You just have to check Netflix or any DVD store, or Amazon for lesbian themed movies and you will see a plethora or them, many much better than this French bore that has more scene of people eating and dancing than anything else. And four hours long? I completely understood why Lawrence of Arabia and Intolerance were four hours long, but this lesbian porno? Excusez moi, c'est vraiment too much! My advice, your life would be better off skipping this film in theaters. Wait until it comes to Netflix, or to a DVD store near you. And when it does, skip it and watch something else.P.S. Don't be fooled by the 8 stars this film has received, they're probably all from the gay and lesbian community.",

            "review_title": "Disillusionment",
            "content": "I liked here the first chapter with exploratory Adele. I liked this girl above all, a revelation. Her guarded grace, her aloof interest, her reluctant fearlessness of not being afraid to face she really liked being kissed by a girl or step out on her own in a lesbian bar, she anchors these opposites so well, within them is her story of not being sure if it's a romance film or not.So I was invested, in a journey where it seemed we wouldn't let artificial constructs keep us from finding out about things but wouldn't do it at any cost either, it promised bold sensitivity. The sex scenes I suppose where the filmmaker's way of having this balance, but it's there that a creeping sense enters the picture.The filmmaker sets all this up so we can have in the second chapter disillusionment, desire and emptiness, all that seems to plague us. That's all part of life, disillusionment a part of growing, right? There are some poignant scenes, but an opaque weariness takes over. It ends with ambiguous reconciliation and a chance miss of potential romance.The problem for me is that philosophy has completely broken down in the West. It suffuses the mind with complexities, but has no tools to sever them, to address the vital things. A complex web surrounds why, in short, the main question since the Greeks has been what to do with the transcendent stuff, soul, ideas, beauty, just where to put them. In medieval times the discussion became about ways to know god and limits of that knowing. Science said let's stick to things we can measure, throwing out transcendent conjecture. Modern philosophy thought to take all that stuff thrown out by science and see if they can't be modeled anyway. That's what the French were trying to do en route to WWII by placing being at the center\u2014the self for whom life poses a dilemma\u2014, model a more direct life. The film is plainly about such a self. The French motto is even mentioned that 'existence precedes essence' which says that I first inhabit a life and then know all the other stuff. In the film, opaque existence is contrasted with abstractions of all sorts: classroom talk of time and eternity, Sartre, the gf's paintings of the girl that freeze in the sketch something that was first known as touch.The limitation for me, evident in the film here, is the underlying mechanistic assumption in the effort to reflect. There's actually a specific difference that can be traced I think to models of consciousness, but too technical to go on here. Broadly said, if life is a field in nature, they will go on about how the field appears to me, empty. But the only way a garden can appear in the landscape is for someone to first envision a garden there.So Adele's failure to find fulfillment is in the end no more than the filmmaker's failure (a reluctance? a lack of faith in the possibility?) to envision transcendent meaning. This is not anywhere in itself, you have to cultivate it, all of us have to in life. Our best makers give it their all, I was recently wowed by a film called Stellet Licht about just this. The only thing the film reflects in the end is this inability to cultivate, the dryness as material truth. Not in my house.",

Nothing interesting ever happens. Unless you find shots of an expressionless face interesting. God... just add drool coming out of her mouth, and it would be perfect. And then, when eventually, Adele has a burst of blubbering crying, she still manages to do THAT with a flat affect. So I guess that means I'm supposed to care about her. I didn't. And during the sex scenes I kept saying to myself \"this movie is basically an excuse for soft porn isn't it.\" Oh and for some reason there's a lot of scenes of people eating what appears to be the same recipe of spaghetti, over and over. Stupid. Stupid, boring movie. Unless you like staring at a girl's face that does nothing but sit there motionless. Like I said just add some drool.And I suppose it's custom in France for people to talk while shoving food in their mouths? Exposing everything that's stuck to their tongues and teeth, in between words, because that's what happens, when they eat. They talk. And we definitely get to \"SEE FOOD\" if you remember the old joke where you ask someone if they want \"SEA food\" and you stick your tongue out with food on it so they \"SEE food.\"I had to force myself to watch this highly recommended, award winning piece of crap til the end. It's mostly just the main character that does it for me. I can't get over how dopey she is. I really grew sick of her pretty quick and didn't give a crap about anything she might be going through. This entire movie is mostly shots of her dumb flat dull dopey face being boring. What a total piece of crap. Lesbians being boring lesbians. And I guess I'm supposed to care.",

            "content": "BLUE IS THE WARMEST COLOR is a quite extraordinary movie. From the first minutes director Abdellatif Kechiche fixes his camera on the protagonist Adele (Adele Exarchopoulos), and never lets us take our eyes off her as she embarks on a voyage of discovery, both personal and sexual. The movie thus becomes extremely claustrophobic; we see Adele's reactions to each and every situation, and share her pain as she discovers her sexuality. Set in small-town France, the film explores how Adele and her girlfriend Emma (L\u00e9a Seydoux) try to continue their passionate relationship in a world where same-sex affairs are still stigmatized. That knowledge inevitably affects the way in which Adele and Emma react to one another. Emma comes across as unsympathetic, more interested in herself, her life and her career rather than her loved ones; but we can understand why she behaves in this way in a context where success depends mostly on career achievement. Adele has not got to that stage yet, but painful experiences - both at school and out of school - teach her to become more hardhearted, even if that feeling can only be expressed through a noncommittal expression direct to camera. The film has explicit sex scenes, but they seem somehow remote, almost as if Adele and Emma are trying their best to achieve personal fulfillment through physical means. The fact that they cannot achieve it only emphasizes the difficulties of their relationship. Beautifully photographed with an eye for telling detail, BLUE IS THE WARMEST COLOR is one the starkest depictions of love I've seen for a long time.",

            "content": "My discovery of this movie came from it being listed amongst 12 Years a Slave as movies to watch out for after the Toronto International Film Festival. Outside of that though, I wasn't familiar with anyone involved. All I saw was a beautiful love story, which just so happened to feature two female leads. Of course though, like many, I also heard about the scenes which if cut, or edited, would easily turn this NC-17 movie into a light R.Characters & Story The story focuses on a young, doe-eyed, 17 year old, girl named Adele (played by Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos) who has the type of look and persona which makes her seem like someone whose life is often defined by others. Alongside her is Emma (played by L\u00e9a Seydoux) who is her opposite. Emma is a take charge young woman who expresses her wants and desires, let's herself be the odd one in the crowd, and to me has the type of social qualities most would want for a partner, but also the passion you would want in an ideal lover.Their love affair, naturally, is the focus of the film, as well as the establishing of Adele as a person, and even the movie establishing French culture. Thus making it so that over the course of 3 hours you get a love story worth envy, but one which also shows human flaws. Or perhaps, better said, human vulnerability.PraisePerhaps the best bit of praise I can give for this film is that despite being 3 hours, you only feel it in your tail-bone for sitting so long. You see, those 3 hours are truly utilized so that the romance doesn't feel rushed, but something which naturally progressed from two curious strangers meeting eyes, to casual conversation, and then a build toward a relationship. And the main reason I like that the build is slow is because it allows everyone to be properly established. Adele gets to have a foundation made for her, which makes it so when Emma comes in, she does have something outside of their romance. For example, in the film we see Adele protest French austerity measures and talk French literature. Then, after Emma is introduced, the topics expand to French art, the topic of pleasure/sex, and each conversation strangely feels natural and not even a hint pretentious, like in The Counselor. But perhaps one of the best things about the film is the two aforementioned actresses' performance. Now, when it comes to the two girls, Exarchopulos gives the type of performance where you can see why she was cast, but at the same time she is outmatched by Seydoux. In the film, while Exarchopulos is clearly established as the lead, Seydoux's Emma quickly gets you for she shows more personality than Adele. In fact, I would consider Emma to be a 3-dimensional character who is sweet, aggressive, emotionally vulnerable, and everything you expect from a performance which is supposed to be an actual human. In comparison, Exarchopulos works Adele's inability to define herself to create a character which isn't lesser, but not as bold. Unfortunately though, it makes it so as the story goes on Emma gets more of your attention and empathy than Adele, to the point Adele seems more fit to be in the supporting role.Criticism Which is perhaps one of the biggest issues with the film, as well as small issues with story consistency. To me, Adele slowly begins to lose the authority you expect in a lead once Emma is introduced, then the movie unfortunately does a time jump, of 6 years, which rids her of the foundation made by us watching her interactions with family and friends. For, and here comes the issue with consistency, they are cleanly cut from the film and never mentioned again. With that being done, Adele pretty much relies on Emma's character like a crutch to maintain interest, or relevance, and it makes it so where you can see 20+ minutes of Adele scenes which can be cut without and real visible consequence.The last thing to critique is the infamous sex scenes. Truly, this film blurs the lines between what can be considered art and what is pornographic, and admittedly I say this because while the sex scenes are complex in terms of them trying to show you how these two women are passionately in love, it is hard not to simply sexualize it and take away the romance. Which I solely blame on myself for this film makes you realize how American media makes violence something of the norm, but people having sexual relations, especially two women, something which perhaps can't surpass your libido. Yet, I must say the length and aspect of watching these sex scenes is a slight bit uncomfortable. For one, the \"detail,\" for a lack of a better word, is so intimate you feel like a voyeur, and then to make it worse you share this experience with other people in the theater. Thus making it where you get that pornographic feel like you are doing something indecent as if you all are at a XXX movie theater.Overall: Worth Seeing Truly, the only issue I had with the movie overall was that post time- jump, and story inconsistency. Outside of that, it is hard to find major issues. After all, this film goes for a raw romance that doesn't do the usual drivel where they meet, get into some stupid fight, reconcile and happily ever after. This film tries to show a woman who is exploring her sexuality, falling in love, and somewhere between playing an expected role and trying to figure out if this role is comfortable enough to be her true self. That is why I, despite this being 3 hours and having a minor consistency issues, I don't see why this isn't worth seeing.",

            "content": "Abdellatif Kechiche's Blue is the Warmest Color (La Vie d'Ad\u00e8le \u2013 Chapitres 1 & 2) couldn't be a more alienating film for American audiences if it tried. It's a French film concerning a young lesbian couple with explicit scenes of sex, bearing an NC-17 rating, and is ten minutes shy of being three hours long. Of course, it's predominately alienating to the close-minded and those who would rather stick to safer works than dare explore something more provocative and daring. For the brave, Blue is the Warmest Color is a damn fine gem; a moody, sophisticated, and entirely fearless film combining lingering shots of facial expressions, intimate and extremely graphic sex scenes, and scenes that are eerie in their emotional honest to create one of the most unique dramas about love in years to come.With the stride and prominence \"queer cinema\" has reached in recent years, I would not be surprised if one day I see Blue is the Warmest Color's subversiveness as something of a clich\u00e9 later on. While gay and lesbian cinema has become one of the fasting rising niches in cinema, with overwhelming American support for tolerance and LGBT acceptance and extreme disgust and opposition to intolerance and homophobia, writers and directors have churned out films exploring sexuality at light speeds, with little time to admire all of the film's own unique elements due to the niche now being overblown. Blue is the Warmest Color will either have a collectively different future or go on to be the Breathless of queer cinema. We will have to wait and see.The film stars Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos and L\u00e9a Seydoux, two stars destined for great things being so young. Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos plays Ad\u00e8le, a teenager who goes to a high school where boys seem to be all her friends gossip about, completely disregarding schoolwork, personal issues, celebrities, music, etc - boys are their sole concern in life. In a fit of confusion and possessing a constant desire for acceptance, Ad\u00e8le goes out with a random, attractive guy at her school, but becomes increasingly fascinated with a blue-haired girl that she sees around town. When she finally ups the courage to talk to her, she realizes the girl (named Emma and played by L\u00e9a Seydoux) is full of life, unique insights, and sexual curiosity, much like herself.Meanwhile, Ad\u00e8le begins to heavily question her sexuality. She has always assumed she was straight, but Emma brings to light how she experimented with both sexes and always felt more comfortable with females. With that, Ad\u00e8le and Emma begin to have sex - explicit sex, which Kechiche refuses to sugarcoat or shadow. Everything from cunnilingus to sixty-nining to even more raunchy sex acts are performed, all captured through a tender camera lens.These scenes will provoke all sorts of reactions among people, some praising it as daring and others condemning it as exploitative and \"gross.\" I fall in the first category. Lesbian sex scenes have long been used to generate arousal and be the subject for male masturbatory pleasure in film. Here, while occasionally arousing and very often exciting, they provoke a certain tenderness by showing their characters at their most vulnerable. The characters do it to stimulate each other and find ways to please each other in ways they could never have foreseen. In other words, these sex scenes perfectly define what sex really is.Furthermore, the film uses lengthy, lingering shots of facial expressions, mostly that of Ad\u00e8le's but also frequently showing Emma's in addition. These provide for a beautiful showcase of humanity in its characters, by showing the subconscious things they do. So rare is a film this careful and explorative with its character subtleties, but so rewarding it is.The film's use of symbolism and its thematic relevance should also not be shortchanged in light of its explicit depictions of sex. Two key scenes detail the film's themes of how class and family play a role in how we see human sexuality; they're both set at dinner tables, one at Emma's parents' home and the other at Ad\u00e8le's parents' home. Right off the bat, we see how artistic and unique Emma's family is, clearly aware of their daughter's lesbian relationship with another girl and are happy so long as she appears safe and happy. On the other hand, despite obvious nods of affection and care for each other, Ad\u00e8le's parents are clearly not aware of their relationship during dinner, viewing it as nothing other than a very close female friendship.The underlying method to Blue is the Warmest Color's madness is how it shows how big of a role social class plays a part in contemporary relationships. Emma's parents seem more open-minded, artistically-literate, and liberal, whereas Ad\u00e8le's seem to represent the more traditionalist, conservative mindset of the world, one where relationships are simple and not that complex, especially when its subjects are so young.As if trying to detail a young, unconventional, and complex lesbian relationship wasn't tough enough, Kechiche fills the film with these heavy themes along with color symbolism (blue representing daring actions, passion, and love, with subtle hues of red indicating calamity, disruption, and conflict later in the film). The only thing working against Blue is the Warmest Color is its runtime, which gets winded by the two hour mark. Many romances are hard to invest in for a long period of time, but in this particular case, the film hits somewhat dry patches around this mark, which lead it to a somewhat watery third act. Nonetheless, there is some true cinematic magic here, between the themes it poses, the relationship it depicts, the facial expressions it lingers on, the sex it bravely shows, and the symbolism it subtly evokes. It's the kind of film that makes you value your already possessed relationships and makes you hunger for future ones.Starring: Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos and L\u00e9a Seydoux.

It's the kind of movie that can stick with you after watching it, and it's a heart breaker in its own right. The film follows Adele, a high school girl who makes a boyfriend and has sex, and finds that does nothing for her. She realizes she's more into girls, and winds up with Emma, the blue-haired art student, despite Emma being older. Revelations of lesbianism boil over into conflict on high school grounds, but the movie doesn't dwell on that much. Adele has her sexual awakening, but ultimately this turns into a story of loss.This film drew some attention for explicit lesbian, straight sex and masturbation scenes, and these are well-done and successfully erotic, conveying passion though not necessarily realism. Blue Is the Warmest Colour isn't porn, however, and is dominated by drama. Some of that drama involves the stigma of lesbianism, other drama centres on the relationship crumbling after the shocking revelation Adele has had an affair with a boy. One feels sorry for her when Emma furiously throws her out, but as a coming-of-age story, she attempts to move on. Love stories aren't typically my thing unless there's some kind of twist, but I'd say this is one of the best handling of lesbianism in the movies that I've seen. It is aided by passion, a motif of the colour blue, the female form and believable drama. Blue Is the Warmest Colour is now one of my favourite films of French cinema.",

Long story short: it's an okay art piece that hit all the right buttons for people new to LGBT films, but those buttons are overly pushed and obnoxious with nothing gained nor lost in terms of originality.

There were too many scenes that did not fit, long love scenes that looked like porn, long irrelevant scenes from parties and fragments from the character's professional life that were completely disconnected from the rest of the plot.A lot of superficiality and irrelevance. If the movie would be two hours and a half shorter, it would be much better. I am amazed that this movie is so well reviewed. It's a movie about love that didn't leave me with any kind of new insight. Maybe if I was a teenager, it would have had some value. There were some good parts though, but after two hours of a faulty story it's hard to connect and enjoy it.",

            "content": "Blue is the Warmest Color, was a painful to watch movie, and not for the right reasons. This movie was completely lukewarm, and really did not have anything to justify it being made into a movie. It was pretty well just a base, non creative love story with the only things changed being its now about some lesbians, with gratuitous nudity thrown in and conversations about art throughout the film.I think the major problem with this film was not the actresses or the premise, it was the lacklustre hack of a director, who is clearly just some straight guy making a movie on what is mainly accepted to be a love story and trying to be edgy. There really is no food for thought in this film, and the storyline is almost bordering on one that would be equal to a porn movie.There was no *true* conflict or struggle in the film. The movies \"Brokeback Mountain\" and \"Boys Don't Cry\" are far superior to this movie, and deal with similar story lines.Now what did provide food for thought was Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos's role in all of this. While the movie storyline was utterly forgettable, what did somewhat hold my attention was wondering what kind of effect the making of this movie had on this young, innocent girl. I hope she gets recognized, as she did a great job, and has shown to be willing and quite malleable, unfortunately she was caught up in a lacklustre storyline, with a b-movie script. The director is someone who is just trying to imitate actual artistic and deep movies, while throwing in nudity to try and wriggle his way into being noticed. The reason I am coming down so hard is because I was expecting at least a good movie, but within the last hour and half (of a 3 hour film) the movie consistently got worse and worse. The movie fully consists of teaching in a classroom, talking about art, and sex/kissing.If you want an edgy, nonrated/nc-17 movie then watch \"Nymphomaniac,\" or \"Enter the Void,\" of which the latter, interestingly enough, is playing in this movie during the theatre scene.Worse movie I have seen in a long time...",

            "content": "Blue is the Warmest Colour has become one of the most controversial films of the past year on the basis of its frank depiction of lesbian sexuality alone, but the film is so much more than that. The sex is merely a device used to accelerate the plot and enrich the realism of the film. The film presents a very beautiful and ultimately devastating love story that far transcends the hyped bedroom proclivities of the two main characters.Its central character is Adele, played by Adele Exarchopoulos in a fearless, breathtaking performance. Ever word she utters, ever expression on her face, it all felt so sincere. She is the heart and soul of this film. We get to know her insecurities about her appearance, her experimentation, confusion and ultimate realisations/awakenings with sexuality and her development from girl to woman. Her relationships, with the break ups and make ups, her plans for her life all become the focus of the 187 minute run time. Honourable mention goes to Lea Seydoux, who provides an enchanting performance as the free spirited, artistic Emma. She provides an interesting contrast to the indecisive and sometimes confused Adele in that she knows exactly what she wants in life - what pleases her and what doesn't.The film is quite heavy on symbolism with the colour blue. It is very prevalent in the film, appearing most obviously in Emma's hair, in the club Adele visits, in the fare she uses at the rally, in the classroom she teaches, in the dress Adele wears during her last encounter with Emma. The cinematography itself is beautiful and rich, full of earth tones and exquisite colour, giving the film a dreamy haze. The rather long run time may detract you, but don't let it. There is never a dull moment and the movie progresses like a breeze, every single scene is crucial and well constructed. Do not miss this, it could arguably one of the best film's of 2013 and certainly one of the most honest depictions of a relationship between two people in cinema in recent memory.",

Sado- masochistic, almost. She's asking a question she knows the answer to and the answer will torture her).It's an emotional voyage, the sex scenes are not that important, there's more lascivious eating than sex, the leads are absolutely incredible.

Feel the agony and ecstasy of first love. There is a wistfulness about young adulthood that I find deeply moving, on screen and in literature. And the actors did a great job here.Having said that, this movie was about as deep as a teacup saucer. Who is Adele, our main character? We are told, in throwaway lines, that she likes all music except metal, and that she enjoys American cinema: \"All the directors. Scorcese, Kubrick...\" This information is not relevant to the story, and is never referenced again. She wants to be a teacher, and her parents are very square. This is also irrelevant: she does not display any teacher-esque character traits, and her parents are never mentioned again after the one dinner scene. Adele likes literature. A laughably predictable plot device: she likes to read tragic love stories. She is mostly silent throughout the movie. To the point that her lover tries to emotionally manipulate her into being more interesting.Speaking of her lover, what do we know about Emma? She likes Gustav Klimt, and snipes at anyone who calls him decorative. She is a cliche of an art student on film: overconfident, quotes famous philosophers, while painting very mediocre works inspired by whichever lover she has at the time. She is also inexplicably successful. She is also living an inexplicably wholesome suburban lifestyle.It doesn't matter who they are as people, though. Why their conversation is so stinted. Or why they are so irresistibly attracted to each other. It doesn't matter that the sex they're having is wildly unrealistic. While being shot so clinically.What matters is that Adele is taking a shower and the camera slides all along her arched back and butt. That Adele is walking to the bus and the camera slides all along her butt. Adele is dancing and the camera is followin her hips. Adele is washing dishes and the camera slides along her butt. Adele is swimming, eating spaghetti, looking at her lover, teaching, reading in school, and contributing nothing in conversation, all with the same look of wistful vacancy and parted full lips.",

The story of two Lesbians is a vehicle for some extremely (I would underline that and put it in all caps) gratuitous sex scenes, filmed by a director who is, to my knowledge, straight.Now, I shall grant the few readers of this that, in most circumstances, that is not a good ground to dismiss something as exploitation, but in light of the two actresses claims of harassment during the shooting and the nearly pornographic content of the film (no, seriously, don't show this to your parents), I make my case there.The film graphic content of this film also has the, I assume, unintended consequence of completely alienating me, personally, from this supposed \"intimate and heartfelt\" relationship. It's hard to think of intimacy and closeness when a ten minute scene of the two actresses performing various lesbian sex acts is thrown in your face.Performance-wise, I preferred L\u00e9a Seydoux's performance, as she at least gave an expressive performance. Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos might as well have been wearing a mask, because the only time I noticed her emoting was when tears were coming out of her eyes.The editing at points seemed rather dissonant, with a couple of these sex scenes being accompanied with music that would signify something romantic \u00e0 la most Hollywood movies. It has a strange disconnect for me in these scenes, again, mostly because of their graphic content.In terms of script-writing it was alright. It stuck pretty closely to the Hollywood three-act structure, so it would have been pretty hard to mess that up, but, while I can't say I was bored, I am still perplexed as to why this movie was three hours long.And that's about all I want to say about this film.Exploitative, kinda hypocritical, alright screenplay, some decent acting.",

If you aren't fascinated with Adele, you probably wouldn't like this film. Personally, I think I could have watched her on screen for another hour or so were I allowed.Abdellatif Kechiche's work reminds me of the work of Eric Rohmer in that realism, in periphery, is captured but through the eyes of someone who ismagical. It seems quite fitting ironically that his characters discuss Sartre regarding existence preceding essence, for in this film, the essence of the main character drives the existence of the narrative.Also, I would like to add that in certain frames of the movie, Adele Exarchopoulous is the spitting image of a young Sandrine Bonnaire, who also exploded onto the scene with A NOS AMOURS and VAGABOND some 30 years ago.

Tight and close shots give the feeling of being in the moment with the characters and feeling the same emotions that they feel. The acting was superb and extremely well-done, proving evidence that the directing was near flawless. Being one of the rare films where I feel captivated throughout the entirety of the film I will gladly put this one on my 'watch again' list. I desire to speak about two exceptional qualities that stood out to me during the film. The first quality that I would like to discuss was the incredible acting job by Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos. Rather than mutely following direct orders from the director she was instructed to make her character her own and improvise her lines in order to make the experience more real. In so doing we are delivered a breathtaking view on a character that seems real and tangible. Ad\u00e8le made the character her own and I would like to say 'Job well done' to her for such an incredible performance!The second quality that needs to be discussed is the overlying theme of love and its significance to Ad\u00e8le. The film begins by discussing love at first sight and the deep meaning of that unique feeling we get in our bosoms on such occasions. We then continue on into the convoluted love life of Ad\u00e8le, where her friends tempt her and push her to do what she feels uncomfortable to do. It is after an unsettling experience that Ad\u00e8le becomes aware of new desires kindling within her. She meets Emma, a provocative and beautiful woman with blue hair. It is in this moment that Ad\u00e8le becomes aware of what she was missing and realizes her capability of love.It is in this blossoming romance that so many viewers find controversy and disgust in the film. Instead of claiming that the film was full of 'controversy' and that there was too much 'sex' and 'nudity' I would like to point out that those intimate moments expressed visually on screen were mere looking glasses into our own private lives and emotions. Leave the immaturity behind and accept the beautiful representation of love for what it is. After all, are we not all human and are we not all capable of love?",

I don't know how old everyone who wrote all the glowing reviews here was, but I'm a 38 year old woman and.even though I realized one of the main actresses is actually only a couple of years younger than me, when the movie was made both of them looked very, very young. The actress who played Adele looked way too young, her face was very child-like, like 15 or 16 in this movie. Watching these two very, very young looking actresses engage in very long, very explicit sex scenes was uncomfortable and felt very wrong to me, almost like watching a child engage in sexual acts with another child, it felt so violating even to me as a viewer. Two hours was all I could take, I did not finish the movie. I would think the reason this movie was rated so highly is because it appeals to the straight male demographic and the under 25 lesbians and gays. As for the rest of us lesbians over the age of 25, we know better. This is why I rarely want to watch lesbian movies, because they are usually made in the perspective of straight men for mainly straight men. The 3 star rating is only for the actress who played Emma, who I think was very natural, and very believable as a lesbian (even though she's not one in real life).

Her emerging same-sex desires lead her into a relationship with Emma (L\u00e9a Seydoux), a fine arts university student.At three hours long, a love story like this has great challenges. Luckily, it meets these challenges mainly due to the powerful performances of the two actresses, especially Exarchopoulos. Ironically, despite the great length, there were holes in the script such as whether Ad\u00e8le is honest about her relationship with Emma toward her parents as well has what happens to Emma's previous lover before she meets Ad\u00e8le.Much commentary has been made on the explicit sex scenes. While they are certainly erotic, the principle \"less is more\" might have been applicable here as the length of the scenes, their frequency and close-ups diminish the impact overall. It almost seems that it was deliberately made to be pornographic in order to stimulate a certain mindset that doesn't necessarily regard such scenes as \"art\". This was also a criticism by Julie Maroh who wrote the book on which the film was based.Some scenes explore the conflicting mindset between the artistic class vs. those who believe one must set one's career prospects toward something that presumably guarantees employment. This was welcome though it could have been more explored.The two greatest scenes are between Exarchopoulos and Seydoux near the end. One is a serious fight; the other is a truce. The latter is so real, it makes one dig into one's past and cry with the performers. These scenes and the two great actresses behind them are the true strength of \"Blue is the Warmest Colour",

I saw it yesterday, and today I feel mentally absolutely devastated. I'm a middle-aged guy with a wife and two kids, a tight muscular type, very short hair (I am getting bald, I'm afraid), and actually look a bit like a biker. So earlier today, down at the pub, where I sat alone in a corner, I had to stand up immediately and leave, when I realized that tears was running down my rugged face and dripping into my beer. What has happened is that seeing this movie has made me remember my own youth. I did remember the facts already, but I had forgotten the emotion. Now I'm engulfed in that emotion again - and it's terrible. Hopeless love is a terrible thing. \"Love will tear us apart again\" as Ian Curtis so accurately put it. I too crashed and burned in love - as most of us do across the ages - and now I realize that I'll never forget it. It makes it even harder since now, as a mature adult, I know that love is an illusion. It's a weird mental construction built by the brain as a reaction to a hormonal abnormality. I can understand that our species will benefit from us desiring one another in a sexual manner, but why, oh why do we need to fall in love like that? Love is insanity, and hopeless love like that depicted so spot on in this movie is pure natures torment.And now a bit about the movie: Just as the special effects in \"Gravity\" transcends the concept of \"special effects\" and becomes actual reality, so the acting - by both the female leads - in this movie transcends acting and becomes actual reality. I experienced the movie as a sequence of scenes from actual life. I didn't perceive it as acting, but thought for 3 hours that I was an angel viewing actual events as they occurred. It was realism in a very different manner than I have ever seen before. The only thing that comes close is \"Fucking \u00c5m\u00e5l\" by Lukas Moodysson - another must see if you enjoyed this one.But I didn't enjoy it.

The story is told through raw and graphic scenes, but also interesting dialog that leads you towards every aspect of Ad\u00e8le's life and her maturing process, as she learns from her mistakes and grows not only as a person, but more importantly as a woman. The acting is superb, as both Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos and L\u00e9a Seydoux shine in their roles. You feel the chemistry in their interaction in every scene, and despite all the controversy, their sex scenes are very believable and convey to the audience all the feelings that they are experiencing. Kudos to Abdellatif Kechiche for directing such a bold movie. All the details shown to us are justified, and the director makes sure that the public understands and feels what the people in the movie go through. It is in fact a long movie, but although I felt it wasn't necessary, the running time didn't deter me and I would recommend it to anyone who is interested watching a film that talks about growing up and exploring sexuality without prejudice and moral dilemmas.Rating: 8,5",

This film is of course in my own personal opinion NOT..NOT! an 8.1 film. I'm not saying it's a bad story at all. I am however going to point out that this is nothing unlike what we've seen before. The story suffers from a severe chronic case of epic streamlinization. I's the same old story about a young girl who has trouble finding out who she is... A teenage girl and her troubles...wow..as if we haven't heard that before. The story unfolds as she finds out more about her sexuality which is where I'm getting really annoyed because as it appears that's most likely what people are basing their insanely high rating on! TIMELINE PEOPLE!! Through out the story she's basically partying, dining, walking around, having sex, partying, having sex, more partying, walking around, spilling her guts, opening up, more partying, having sex, and...hmmm...yea...thats pretty much it. Same old story ALL OVER AGAIN but this time we have soft-core porn implemented I KID YOU NOT! Being able to take your clothes off DOES NOT FREAKING MAKE YOU A GOOD ACTOR !! QUITE THE CONTRARY IF YOU FEEL YOU HAVE TO TAKE YOUR CLOTHES OFF IT TYPICALLY MEANS THAT YOU HAVE NOTHING WORTHWHILE TO SAY! so...let the body do all the talking...Yea.... This director is an idiot and the screenplay writer should be sued for blatantly copying and creating another damn film about youth and identity. Its getting so freaking old and the considering the fact that these scenes of intimacy....actually scratch that...these soft-core porn scenes are the only thing that distinguishes the film from the MILLION OTHERS HAVING PRACTICALLY THE EXACT SAME STORY what really keeps this film alive is magnified as hell! I 'believe' it was Emilia Clarke from Games of Thrones that confronted the directors and said that she wanted to be known for her acting and not her breasts. Now that is a REAL ACTRESS!!! THAT IS A REAL FREAKING ACTRESS RIGHT THERE! Let the story be driven by psychological aspects, conflicts and so on etc. Good acting and dedication to the role you're playing like Angelina Jolie... she is without question a prime example of what it means to embed yourself within or becoming one with the character you've been tasked to portray.God almighty! 8.1..absolutely not!! Hell No! That is so dishonest and utterly laughable actually. This film superseding the likes of Avatar... Bram Stokers Dracula... Lord of the rings films and almost the Hunger Games 2 with the fantastic Jennifer Lawrence!

More or less... Had that been the case I couldn't case less. Hell I can even agree on that. But the fact that it got a 8.1...now that makes me really really angry! To dare compare this to some of the finest and most awesome films ever made is simply unacceptable and utterly ridiculous!This film is without all this sexual content WHICH DOES NOT...NOT! bring out the 'professional' side of these 'actors' More like amateur porn stars actually. This film is a 4 out of 10. I'm basing my rating not only on the content which is more like a 5 - 6 but also the circumstances of its creation. The fact that its absolutely nothing new and far too much time has been put into the sexual aspect. Dialog has been superseded ENORMOUSLY HERE!!!!!!!!!!!! I would've ranked it higher but honestly..the story is old news. The structure is so freaking identical so almost every single other teen movie. There are moments in the movie that are utterly superfluous such as several party moments which is also where this rather annoying music plays non-stop. It is a 173 minute long copy pasted drama combined with soft-core porn which is practically the only thing that keeps it alive. Everybody is just waiting with utter anticipation for the next girl to take her cloths off and let the girl on girl action commence. Yea....that pretty much sums it up aside from the whining about identity and relationship quarrels. Character development is a joke as well because this 'director' has put like zero innovation into making our lead characters credible! There is so much more to say but honestly I'm done. Conclusion here is that if you wanna watch another teenage drama that turns into your average adult quarrelsome love story combined with a rather extensive touch of nudity and intimacy then this is the the film for you. If not then I strongly suggest you save your money and watch something else. There is NOTHING ground breaking about this film whatsoever. It's the same old, streamlined as hell, dramatic, way longer than it deserves to be, drama/love story and the director and the screenplay knew that wasn't gonna cut it so what did they do... They hired 'actors' with 'experience in certain fields of expertise' most likely. How else could they keep this clonish piece of garbage alive. How ladies and gentlemen? Like your average salesman would say: Sex sells! SEX SELLS! That's it.",

            "content": "Watching this movie was like watching a highly believable and very realistic scenarios involving two lesbian, actually one bi and one les. With Emma being the lesbian and Ad\u00e8le being the bisexual. And the characteristics of these two characters are very different. Adele reminded me of a hamster or a gerbil and Emma is like a mix between a fox and a wolf. The movie starts off pretty enticing and intriguing for at least the first half, than I personally thought it started to drag. Mainly the first half is full of flames and it started to die out, like most relationships. But that just adds to the realism, but it still did feel like the movie was dragging from time to time. With dialogues that are very realistic but didn't really have a point or direction. The thing about this movie is that just about everything flows so realistically and naturally. Even the two protagonists looked like they were born to play these roles. Because it did not seem like they were acting at all, but just being themselves. From the beginning to the transition face for the characters, especially Emma, just didn't seem like it was acting. Which is one of the biggest compliments you can give an actress. I didn't think this was a amazing masterpiece of a film, but I did appreciate it for what it is. Which is a raw and realistic romance between two female lovers and the obstacles they face. However I still have to take in the fact that besides the lesbian aspect of this film, nothing much really stands out when it comes to the romance between the two characters.6.3/10",

Romance and crying ensues. Typical french crap, the director thinks there's something deep and profound in all the mundane every day stuff the main character does, forces you to be there for all of it while the plot hardly moves. Many scenes are boring, unnecessarily long and there for no good reason. The idea behind making you experience the main character's everyday life must have been to make you more personally acquainted with her, to connect with her in a deeper way. It didn't work.Why would I want to see the main character stuff spaghetti into her face like a barbarian with no effort to light the scene in a flattering way. Does this director understand what pleases the eye and what doesn't? The idea must have been to show what a real family is like at the dinner table without sugarcoating it, in an effort to have you connect with the main character in a more real way but honestly I don't think it added anything.If it wasn't for the gay aspect, no one would watch this junk. The unnecessarily graphic and long sex scenes don't save the film. Male and female genitals everywhere, there were moments when I wasn't quite sure if I was watching a porn movie or not. Some of the drama was portrayed in a very up close and personal way so if you like a lot of closeups of sobbing and crying then I suppose you can get something out of this. I skipped through some of it because it was getting a bit ridiculous at some point. I caught myself bursting out in laughter a few times.She acts like a slut, makes dumb decisions, takes the fall for it and proceeds to sob, sob, sob some more and you're supposed to feel sorry for her. Then she stops being a slut and you're supposed to admire that as a magnificent feat of personal growth. Whatever...",

Crucially, this is not a coming out story, but a film about how in every culture, every society, every group there is prejudice towards those who cannot fit in, even in a group such as the lesbian community, who are themselves discriminated. But even more, the film is about two people who love each other so much, they can also hurt other greatly, reminding us of how vulnerable we are when we give our hearts fully to someone else.\nThe film is famous for its explicit love making scenes, but these scenes really are the same as every other scene in the movie: emotionally in your face. We constantly follow all the characters in deep close ups, which means you will feel all the emotions - from anger to love to being horny or panicking - as if they are your own. It's an incredible way of filming with actors and actresses performing at the absolute top level.\nThe film left me reeling and reminded me of my own love life, regardless of the fact that I'm straight, and all its successes and failures.\nWhat a film.",

I cannot speak for Lesbians, but I think it is meant simply to arouse erections in straight men. The first sex scene does in fact show an erection and as some man said about this film, here on the reviewing site, the sex scene between the two women takes 15 minutes. I did not count the minutes but it certainly must have given a few thrills to sections of the audience who got turned on by it. As for the story; yes it is a love story and for that I give it a 2 but I wondered if ever there would be a male on male epic of 3hours that could tell the same sort of story with the same draw on the public, and get the top prize at Cannes ? I do not think that would happen because all the straight men who are thrilled by this would be disgusted by the explicit sex between men. Sadly Lesbian sex sells and I believe it does no favours for Lesbians. Male sex sells to a niche market. In this country this film was brought out by a prestigious company who produce the ' best ' in world cinema .Male homosexual films are in the main a marginal market ( with the rare exception ) and this site alone proves my point. ' Blue ' gets 332 reviews here, while a male masterpieces like ' Theo and Hugo ' and ' Sauvage get less. The latter film gets 20 reviews!!! A film applauded as a masterpiece when it came out in 2018 by the French press. The revulsion by so many toward sex between men is obvious and only hypocrites would deny that. That in my opinion is the source of almost all male/male homophobia, This film adds nothing in my opinion as a film and for the length of it give me ' La Maman et la Putain ' anytime. I also give it a 2 for its sense of detail, but then again nothing I have not seen before and in better films. I believe Lesbians were divided on this film, but I mention that more as a question than an answer. As a homosexual film, and sorry for those who do not like me putting it into that category, it does not work for me.",

Nearly every scene dragged on for about twice as long as it needed to, and there were several scenes that had no purpose - they didn't move the plot forward nor teach us anything about the characters.

I loved Moonlight, Brokeback Mountain, Call me by your name and even the San Junipero episode from Black Mirror. Although I try to enjoy a movie simply for what it is, I was massively underwhelmed.First off, there is no chemistry. Adele throughout has only one expression on her face - such is an absolute grump that needs to wipe her nose occasionally. I was watching this thinking \"does she even like her girlfriend? Does she want to be in this relationship?\" A few sex scenes and tears at the end doesn't change that when you watching this movie for a god awful 3 hours and there is not a single thing engaging about the characters. Emma was only slightly more likable and quirky, someone for sure the adolescent me would want to be friends with.The sex scenes were really drawn out. Really, really, drawn out for seemingly no reason. I have no problem watching any kind of sex scene but the erotica in this movie seems to overpower anything of substance from even happening. There was no point to it and they go on forever. Erotic movies with sex scenes themselves don't even go on for this long.Sure a large focal point of this movie is about growing up and understanding how relationships cannot always be what you expect, how being young and falling in love can change you, but there was no development from Adele. She looks and behaves exactly the same from start to end, oh, other than getting rid of the messy ponytail. I can't imagine anyone falling in love with such a zombie that the scenes between them crying and arguing were just comical, the constant kissing and touching in the cafe was plain stupid. Like anyone would behave like that in a public place.The only good thing I would say about the movie was it was fun keeping a lookout on everything that was blue otherise it doesnt even deserve 1 star. The style is great. Besides that, I took nothing else away from this movie that was moving, raw, powerful no romantic. Do not waste your time.",

The powerful love experience between Adele and Emma is certainly a central focus. In my view the magnificent acting by Adele Exarchopoulos as Adele totally dominates the film and I tend to think that this is really a slice of life drama, told in brilliant detail, of the life of Adele from 17 until about mid-20's. Adele has one of the most expressive faces ever to grace the screen and is totally natural and convincing. It's no wonder that her performance has garnered so many awards.Adele's performance is perfectly complemented by that of Emma, her lover.The direction is interesting. A close up of Adele's sleeping face always signals a jump in time and perhaps space. Time is treated loosely but effectively; it is impossible to tell the year but the story flows smoothly. Characters drop out without explanation, for example Adele's parents, but with no harm to the flow.The sex scenes are brilliantly done and absolutely necessary to the plot and gaining in-depth character development. I found them to be beautiful and tasteful.The closing credits have a parenthetical subtitle to the main title. It states, in French, the Life of Adele, Chapters 1 and 2. I wish there was a Chapter 3 in work as I felt that the end, with Adele just walking away, was unfulfilling and left me wanting more.All in all a GREAT film that must be seen.I just watched it for the 4th time ... truly a 10.

            "review_title": "Adele Exarchopolous is extraordinary",
            "content": "This is a difficult movie in many ways. It is a small, intimate look at the maturation of high school junior Adele (Adele Exarchopoulous) into a young adult. This young lady's growth is seen primarily through her relationships with first a young man one grade higher than her, and then into a year's long, deeply passionate relationship with the older Emma (L\u00e9a Seydoux). Set in France, but feeling very universal, there are scenes here of amazing power; you are looking in on two people with deep passions and emotions, and you feel like an eavesdropper. Their conversations and their lovemaking are very real (and explicit). The characters talk over each other (like people do), they aren't always terribly articulate about their feelings (especially young Adele, which is very believable), and honestly, it often feels like the viewer has been given a glimpse of true moments in a real relationship. It's vaguely uncomfortable but often thrilling. Very little about the film feels glossy or calculated; and yet it most certainly is calculated. There are many close-ups, which help us see into the minds of the characters when their words don't suffice. The scenes often go on MUCH longer than any \"Hollywood\" film would tolerate.The primary reason to see the film is the incredibly work by Exarchopoulos. This actor won the top award at the Canne film festival, and I don't even need to know what the other possible contenders might have been to know she deserved it. She shared the award with Seydoux, who is also good, but I was always aware she is an actress. Exarchopoulos was something beyond that. The actress herself was not much older than her character (at the beginning), and her youth and unfinished face helped her. But this introverted character says so much with her eyes (and her hair), and the camera roams over her constantly. Amazing.The film has a reputation for its explicit sex scenes, in particular, one very long scene between the two young ladies. It is indeed quite explicit, and the two actresses were quite brave, I'd say. (I know about some of the controversy afterwards; but still trying to take the film as presented.) But I felt the scene went on too long; it actually became boring. It said what it needed to, and then just kept saying it. There are a few scenes like this in this 3 hour film (Yep, a small, intimate coming-of-age film that's 3 hours long!). In fact, while I appreciated the languid pace of the film overall, the director needed a better grasp on when this length was revelatory and when it was lazy and boring. Late in the film, we see a lot of scenes of Adele teaching class to young children. These scenes are charming, show us how competent Adele is becoming, and frankly, give the film some much needed tiny doses of humor. Yet, there's too much of it.The best scene in the film comes early on, when Adele is being confronted by her friends about whether she is a lesbian. One of the young ladies, in particular, is very angry. The verbal and then physical battle that ensue were alarming and gripping and felt very raw indeed. I gasped during the scene and at the end, felt wrung out. Other scenes throughout the film have similar heft (Adele debasing herself in her desire for forgiveness), but this one sticks with me.This film is absolutely worth seeing. While not addressing strictly unique themes nor stylistically ground-breaking, the raw emotion and strong acting are an experience. A journey worth going on.",

            "review_title": "A Beautiful, Emotionally Absorbing & Heart-Shattering Experience",
            "content": "Winner of the prestigious Palme d'Or at 2013 Cannes Film Festival, Blue Is the Warmest Color garnered universal acclaim from critics & viewers around the world for its raw & powerful portrayal of a human story but what really provided this coming-of-age drama a worldwide attention is the substantial amount of controversy it generated from its steamy lesbian sex scenes, which are no doubt graphic in nature.And since every major award winner comes burdened with heavy expectations, this film is no different. It will spellbind some viewers while disappointing others, might be called an exquisite work of art by many while only the explicit content will be worth talking about for the rest. As for me, Blue Is the Warmest Color isn't just one of its year's most potent & emotionally charged films but also one of the most honest & purest depictions of love ever illustrated on film canvas.Loosely based on the French graphic novel of the same name, Blue Is the Warmest Color tells the story of Ad\u00e8le & covers her life as we see her growing, seeking herself, finding herself, losing herself, ultimately coming to terms with everything & moving on with her life. It's neither a social commentary about homosexuals nor even tries to be, and is simply a heartfelt tale of two women who fall madly in love with each other & tries to depict their journey in the most natural manner possible.I don't remember the last time when any filmmaker devoted this much space to its characters in order to let them breathe freely & evolve at their own pace. The direction by Abdellatif Kechiche (who also co-wrote the script & produced the project) is very elegant, composed & pure mastery despite a few inconsistencies, and presents him in complete control of the story from the very beginning to the very end while its screenplay feels heavily improvised & is outstandingly narrated.Cinematography captures the romance of its two lead characters as beautifully as it captures the vividness of France, makes excellent use of raw photography wherever possible & also succeeds in finding a sustained stillness in the close-up shots. Thanks to its brilliant editing, there isn't a single dull moment in the entire film throughout its 3 hours of runtime as time simply flies by once the main plot surfaces for the entire story is wonderfully balanced & streamlined, down to the last frame.Yet it's the two lead performances that are the film's biggest highlight. At just 19 years of age, Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos delivers a marvellously breakthrough performance as Ad\u00e8le and the sheer intensity with which she captured her character's stuffed up emotions & expressions presents an astonishing level of maturity in this young, beautiful & talented actress. And supporting her with another stupefying performance is L\u00e9a Seydoux who plays Ad\u00e8le's love interest Emma, and their on-screen chemistry is impeccable.Finally coming to the controversial sex scenes that have kind of defined this movie ever since it had its first premiere, Blue Is the Warmest Color features one of the most erotic, graphic, explicit & explosive girl-on-girl action in cinema history but this one part is so overly exaggerated & blown out of proportion that it's plainly insulting to the whole film & what it's really about. These scenes add up for a mere 7-10 minutes of screen-time in what is a 3-hour long journey & isn't even the most memorable moment in the film.For a cinema that captures different stages of an intimate relationship in such a painfully honest manner, it's difficult to pick a favourite moment when it boasts so many. Still if I've to choose, I'll go with the one that takes place near the end when Ad\u00e8le & Emma meet after years of separation as this sequence exhibits how their love & affinity for each other hasn't diminished even one bit over the years & how visibly incomplete they are without each other. It's a truly heart-shattering moment but also the most significant & evocative, in my opinion.On an overall scale, Blue Is the Warmest Color is a vibrantly directed, timely scripted, richly photographed, patiently edited, steadily narrated & magnificently performed cinema that not only triumphs as a sensibly crafted coming-of-age drama but also as an endearing & truly heartbreaking story of love. Due to its graphic nature & 179 minutes of runtime, it might not be a picture that every viewer is going to enjoy but as a romance drama, it certainly is one of the purest & finest depictions of love that world cinema has offered us in the last decade.For an emotionally captivating masterpiece that provided me with such an intense, intimate & emotionally-shattering experience, I'll forever have infinite tenderness for Blue Is the Warmest Color.

Anyway the story is not about two women or a lesbian film. yes it happened that for once are not two people of different sex or two men. Perfetto, congrats to the writers, comic and screenplay.But I have to say that despite the too many frames of her mouth, especially at the beginning of the film, the actress Adele E. is superlative, ott, bravissima!",

            "content": "This may be the shortest 3 hour long film I have ever seen. There are countless scenes that capture Ad\u00e8le's life at its absolute mundane; we see her shower, we see her get into bed again and again, watch how she walks and walks and walks. Kechiche shoots everything and then some, and this invalidates the arguments that state the sex scenes are overly long and gratuitous and boring; they are drawn out like any aspect of Ad\u00e8le's life. Watch how a party stands still while a bourgeois-type male artist drones on and on about the ideals of female pleasure, unaware of the discomfort he is causing. Miles of small-talk end in an unsatisfying heterosexual encounter. The shooting style is hand- held, a little jerky, the edits unobtrusive, and there are no swells of a soundtrack to designate periods of change, which can be sometimes problematic. The film covers a long period and this is not always evident (I'm not entirely sure how she is teaching within 2 years of finishing high school) - we have to piece together the progress of their relationship, and when she seeks solace in a male colleague, it is somewhat unconvincing given how little we have been given to work with. Another little bit I particularly disliked was the other male chasing after Ad\u00e8le in the close, a tinge of potential hope that seems inappropriate in a scene doused with melancholy and regret. Kechiche shows us a lot about their lives, and we decipher little details that emphasise just how different the pair are, how incompatible in any aspect apart from physical. Watch how Ad\u00e8le devours spaghetti (similarly to how she devours Emma), an everyday sort of comfort food, with no pretence of grace, but isn't so comfortable with trying oysters. In social situations, observe the camera rack focus again and again when they are separated, always keeping each other in sight, glancing over their shoulders and sneaking glances. But none of them have the sort of emotional impact as that 'love at first sight' moment at the beginning. Emma is clearly comfortable with the pregnant Lise, and eventually ends up with her. Ad\u00e8le is clearly out of her element in the high-class art culture parties, and this is magnified with the numerous teaching scenes, which are completely bare and ordinary. Their respective parents create a wedge between the taboo nature of lesbianism, but this is unfortunately a storyline that is established but never triggered, the potential conflict avoided. The emotional aspects remain. The sex scenes are not gratuitous, they simply are what they are. The first one, more than 7 minutes long, shows the initial raw physical attraction in intimate close-ups of intense desire (of course, not the same sort of coverage of a PG13 sex scene, where the female's bra stays on, where they grind into each other's stomachs, where the close-ups are so extreme it is undecipherable, and the post-coital sheets are very unrevealing). The next, subdued and restrained, as they try to avoid being heard by Ad\u00e8le's parents. The third time Ad\u00e8le begs for it, but Emma is on her period and refuses, and though this seems normal, we see the sexual frustration etched in the youthful and inexperienced face. But the raw physical attraction and carnal lust is most apparent in a scene without any nudity at all - they reconcile in a cosy caf\u00e9 (very covert too), and Ad\u00e8le tries to recapture that connection after some shallow small talk. They fumble and grasps at each other tightly; clearly Emma feels too what they once had, but cannot commit the same act that hurt her so much before. The heartbreak on Exarchopoulos's face when she finds out that they Emma is now with someone else is incredible; you can almost hear the world around her collapse, a feeling that many dread to know the acquaintance of.L\u00e9a Seydoux and Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos were both awarded with the Palme d'Or, an unprecedented honour, but one they truly deserve. The best scene of the film comes from the pair - the confrontation of the affair and the shouting match which leads to their breakup. Kechiche cleverly avoids depicting the mentioned affair in its entirety; we see them dancing, innocently enough, and kissing, less innocent, but none of the sex, so it hits as as brutally as it does to Emma. And surely they would have nowhere near the impact of the lesbian sex scenes. There's additional subtext apart from the issue of being unfaithful - the venom in Seydoux's words indicate just how heartbreaking it is to be confronted with a partner who has taken sexual solace in the opposite sex, as if hiding their relationship was not enough (in a another movie, this would be the sole deal-breaker). Colour, as the title designates, guides us through their journey. Early on during a protest march, Ad\u00e8le lights a flare, and it consumes the screen with the most shockingly vivid blue colour. The same blue pops out amongst the crowd in Emma's hair and is pervasive in every single scene, in clothing, in furniture, in flowers, in the haze of the gay bar, and their love blossoms. Later, as they lie in bed, the camera mirrors Ad\u00e8le's lustful gaze, hovering almost voyeuristically over Emma's bare shoulder, but it is less focused on other things, mainly the brown roots that have outgrown the blue and signify the waning romance. The final shot is a heartbroken and lost Ad\u00e8le, wearing a strikingly blue dress, but that is about the only thing that pops out. The world is once again grey. This was love, in its most potent and destructive form.",

It's really a coming of age story of self discovery as one learns their own desires and intimate passion comes out of the closet. It being a French film it's no surprise that the film is romantic and sexy with unexpected twist and drama when it comes to love. It follows and centers around the life of a French girl an up and coming student named Adele(Adele Exarchopoulos)who will later teach, anyway this is a young lady who thinks she likes having sex with guys. Only later when she meets a girl named Emma(Lea Seydoux)she finds and makes a discovery that her sexual ways are different! Emma has blue hair by the way and blue is by far the warmest color to Adele! The sex and passion between the two ladies is hot and strong the scenes really push the limit for a big screen picture even for an NC-17 film. Thru it all it proves that life, love, relationships, sexual choice and passion is all complex and uncertain. Watch and see \"Blue is the Warmest Color\" is a strong film of passion and raw sexual discovery proving that gratification is different but fun and enjoyable with love being possible for anyone.",

            "content": "Blue is the Warmest Colour is a masterful film; it is emotionally connecting, transcendent, powerful, thoughtful and provocative. Abdellatif Kechiche, the director, imbues the film with an evocative and visceral pathos and genuineness that is lost within many other film's melodrama - it enriches the film with a timelessness, as well as a pertinence. Its long run time in inconsequential, rather intrinsic to the film in fact; by the end Ad\u00e8le and her life has become ingrained in the audiences mind and hearts. The lead actresses are staggering, Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos and L\u00e9a Seydoux embody their characters, only reinforcing the mesmerizingly beautiful, humanistic, yet nihilistic presence Abdellatif Kechiche carefully constructs. Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos in particular does a brilliant job, her character is real because of her, so real that after the film's 3 hour run-time you don't want to say goodbye - it is heartbreaking and emotional in almost metafictional way, it is sentimental in a way that is so forgiving because of its poetry, authenticity, and truth. The film has little theatrical score, so there is little to talk of there, but visually it is intrinsically artful - yet pragmatic. The film is emotionally and artistically sounding and resonant in almost the same way that The Passion of Joan of Arc is; this is likely because, just like Carl Theodor Dreyer's masterpiece, it is primarily close-ups of faces, making it an unaboundedly intimate and (when painful) painful experience. I find it interesting to note the use of the colour blue throughout the film, not because it is used in any kind of innovative way but because the director, Abdellatif Kechiche, has made a staple of it; the original French title of the film is La vie d'Ad\u00e8le or \"The Life of Ad\u00e8le\" but either before the film was produced or the course of production he chose the English title to be \"Blue is the Warmest Colour\", not only acknowledging and legitimising the interesting use of the colour throughout the film, but also making it a title feature - I am not entirely certain of the consequences of this action, but I find that it makes the film so much more subtle in it exploration of Ad\u00e8le's character, ultimately the film's greatest triumph. There are flaws here and there, I was in the party that found the extended sex scenes unnecessary, it is rose-tinted and overly-optimistic of people's tolerance, it is overly-romantic of people's artistic intelligence, and perhaps the film doesn't address prejudice and hetronormativity in the same way that Weekend does, for example, but it remains a remarkably human experience; an experience so grand yet intimate and genuine that Blue is the Warmest Colour is likely one of the great modern visions of love and longing, as well as a true modern LGBT masterpiece.",

            "content": "Each year it seems, several films are selected for hype and often - like Atonement, The English Patient and others of that ilk - you wonder what all the fuss is about. When this occurs with French movies however - Amelie, Les Choristes, right back, in fact, to Les Diaboliques and Le Salaire de la puer - there is a far greater chance of encountering real substance and less shadow. Blue Is The Warmest Colour was one of the flavours-of-the-month in 2013 when, for one reason or another, I failed to get around to watching it. Now, at last, I came across the DVD in the library at the French Institute and decided to give it a whirl. According to the people who monitor and publish such trivia a large percentage of straight men are turned on by lesbian couplings, presumably one reason for porn filmmakers to market such films. As a heterosexual male I have never been attracted to lesbian movies whether graphic or otherwise but I am attracted to GREAT acting and Blue Is The Warmest Colour has great acting in abundance, mainly, of course, from the two leading ladies both of whose acting is beyond praise and not just because they are fearless but because, perhaps just a tad more so in the case of Adele, they inhabit the roles totally. Finding the actress slightly familiar I finally recalled that I had seen her some years ago as one of the children who behaved so badly that all the adults left them to it and abandoned the village, leaving the children to their own devices for what was meant to be only a few hours but then found themselves unable to return. Although the graphic novel on which Blue is based is shares a title with the English translation, the director's choice of title was The Life of Adele, Parts 1 and 2, and in the light of what we get on the screen that is far more accurate. In short this remarkable film deserves every accolade that has come or possibly may still come its way.",

We follow a young woman (a high school girl) as she discovers she might be gay.What I mean by this (not be lesbian) is there are lots of scenes that drag out the personal encounters\u2014in parks, in bars\u2014where the leading woman deals with her new feelings. It's slow. Unless you get absorbed because you relate in particular. I suppose this says something about me, but I'm trying to make it more universal about how movies deal with certain subects that require an empathy from the viewer.After awhile you realize it's filled with really explicit and long sex scenes. That's cool if you are into it and I bet a lot of guys as well as lesbians are. But it's the sex that becomes the plot for long sections, and it isn't what I was into seeing. (It bores me, what can I say?) And it disrupts whatever the larger and deeper elements are here that I think are compelling\u2014searching for love, for identity, and yes for sex that feels true and rewarding. So it could have worked with a much better script and tighter editing. But it needed a different hand as director, too, to make the inner workings click and take on meaning. Because I think this movie is after meaning above all.See it if this sounds at all intriguing. It's a somewhat different film, overall, and has intentions for something better than this.",

First; There is some explicit sex scenes but the movie is not porn. There is a very long sex scene (and a couple brief ones) but perfectly justified in the context and even more on the second viewing of the whole movie. Second, the movie is slow with very long takes; it is true but without you noticing you are inside the movie; feeling everything that happens to each character. For example when Adele and Emma fight; you feel terrible about itThird too many close-ups; it gives a sense of intimacy but the technique was a little abused so I only give it 9 instead of 10.Fourth, things are not very explained Happily is also true; the goal is to experience the live of Adele and her discoveries and fears.

It's lead actress has a face that's a masterpiece of beauty, you never forget it. She's fifteen, and we know that age, those hormones, those sexual motors running. She meets a guy at school who has the hots for her. They have intercourse, only her mind is on one other person. Surprise, she's a slightly older girl, a lesbian with sky blue hair, much more street smart, and sexually advanced, where first looks for our much innocent cutie, take affect like they do a drug. She's hooked. A few days, weeks pass, and they cross paths again, thanks to the avid, adventurous search, of our hottie who has blossomed into a very mature teen, something I must admit, I really liked about this character. The attraction is uncanny, and truthfully at first I couldn't buy it, how a girl as hot as our lead, falls for a girl with average looks, like her, where the blue hair, may'be was the real attraction, but you have to look deeper, where as their friendship progresses, which becomes a love that intensifies, this is where it really made sense, where we really get under the skin of these two, who perform with such seasoned professionalism, they totally sold themselves as these real characters. I guarantee you, you won't forget this girl's face. The lesbian sex scenes, full frontal, and explicit, are probably the hottest I've ever seen, considering their age too. The other sex scene earlier with her and that short lived boyfriend, she blew off, was hot too, but that seemed only minor league. The tragedy within the film is the cheating of the younger party, where the mutual trust bonded between the two, is broken, and can't be rectified. So wanting her back, it's painful and heartbreaking to watch our young one, who has built such a sexual love, want and dependance on her, plead for her forgiveness, where for the other, the point is mute. Her initial maliciousness was ugly, her unforgiveness was scary, an inability to nip it in the bud. After it's sudden ending, it leads us to painfully accept, like her, that this rift can't be repaired, the last twenty minutes of this film, the strongest, that reuniting scene, in that cafe, that becomes choking with sexual energy, beautifully arousing and erotic, the pinnacle of that duration, in what is a near three hour running movie, that passes quicker than you think, the sign of a very engrossing and enjoyable film. BITWC is a warm surprise of a movie, and one of the best movies about real love (and I haven't watched that many) that I've seen, equal to Breaking The Waves, where love sets no bounds. A love immeasurable and unforgettable, this one more so. It is a beautiful, poetic and DARN SEXY film, our lead, definitely someone we can warm up to, and I know we haven't seen the last of this rising star. One of those thoroughly enjoyable films, that stays with ya. Spaghetti lovers beware: the spaghetti eating shots, are cruelly appetizing.",

The interactions are grounded in an insane amount of reality, and it fits perfectly within the documentary esk way the film is presented.The editing was also really good, you may not notice this on a first watch, but there are some great uses of 180 degree cuts, and the Kuleshov effect, it's nothing Oscar worthy, but it does enhance some of the scenes throughout the film.However, although the main story is brilliant, the side cast isn't ever really explained or brought to the foreground. The parents of both Adele and Amanda aren't ever really given any characterisation other than typical stereotype characters, and they barely have any screen time. The \"Friends\" the bully Adele because they assume she's Gay where never mentioned again after the half point of the film, so no real development in their narrative was made either.The film also drags on for stupidly long periods of time during the s3x scenes, I understand that this builds their relationship up in the eyes of the viewer, however this could have been done with the editing and/or using experimental cinematography rather than just plain s3x scenes, it just felt like not much effort was put into it, other than from the actors, and it's unlike me to tell a film to get rid of a s3x scene, but in this case, it just didn't fit.Another aspect that I need to bash this film for is the Cinematography, it is terrible. 90% of the shots are close ups, so the editor can't play around with the shots much to draw attention to certain moments, and the wide shots we do get feels jarring after seeing 5 scenes in a row shot on a 75mm lens on super 35. The films grading is terrible as well with clear brightness masks that are tracked poorly, exposure clipping in every other shot, and many many focus misses. For the exposure, they could have just racked iris and exposed properly, I genuinely don't understand why this films cinematography is so poor. The lack of tripod shots also adds insult to injury, and there's no distinction from dramatic scenes within the cinematography, I think some of the shake was also added in post within shots that where overwise shot static.The edit, although great for the most part, did also seem to struggle with the lack of focal coverage, though I won't rank it down, as I believe this is solely the DoP's fault.Overall I liked this film, and although the narrative struggles to lead anywhere with any characters other than the main leads, the story is compelling due to the brilliant acting that takes a relationship to screen.

At three hours this is no cakewalk to watch, but it was worth every minute of it. The story follows Adele from high school, as she begins to discover what love is and falls into it, into her adult life as she falls out of it and learns more about who she is as a person. There is stellar acting from all involved, but none more so than the two leads Adele and Emma, played by Adele Exarchopoulos and Lea Seydoux, respectively. They put their all into these performances, and the chemistry is palpable on screen. The only negatives I can really come up with involve the much talked-about sex scene which comes at about the midpoint of the film. For one, it lasted too long and because of that it becomes somewhat gratuitous. For the most part the camera doesn't linger too long on \"sexy\" shots, but the sexual content could have been trimmed somewhat. I got the point. Other interesting things I noticed were several classroom scenes and discussions of literature and philosophy which touch on themes that I believe the director was trying to get across in a subtle way. A couple of these take place in the first half of the film, and involve a novel called \"Life of Marianne\" and a Greek play, Antigone. That first one I believe was intentional because the way it was described seems to place it as the literary inspiration and analogue for this film, as the original title LA VIE D'ADELE translates to \"The Life of Adele.\" All of these discussion/references serve as a kind of meta-commentary which I found very intriguing. Finally, I'll touch on the structure of the film. The film is divided into two parts, roughly equal in length. The first half deals with Adele's high school years, and the second half with her adult life. The transition between these two parts is non-existent, but not too jarring either. The structure also works dramatically, so I don't really have a complaint about it. Overall this is a definite must-see, especially for fans of foreign/French dramas.",

            "content": "'BLUE IS THE WARMEST COLOR': Four Stars (Out of Five) A critically acclaimed (and award-winning) French film about a young high schooler who comes of age, by learning about life and love, when she falls for another (older) woman. The film was written, produced, and directed by Abdellatif Kechiche and stars Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos and L\u00e9a Seydoux. It's based on the French graphic novel (of the same name) by Julie Maroh. The movie is a very sexually explicit love story that received an NC-17 rating. It's also 3 hour long! Despite it's overlong running length I found the film to be pretty involving as well as entertaining. It's definitely a well made movie and a fascinating film going experience.Exarchopoulos stars as Adele, a high schooler who's pressured into exploring sex (for the first time) by other students. Her first experience, with a young man she meets at school, doesn't' go well and makes her realize she might not be into men. Then she meets Emma (Seydoux), at a gay bar she goes to with a friend from school, and the two immediately hit it off. Emma (being older and more sexually experienced) is able to teach Adele a lot about sex, love and life in general. Adele moves in with Emma and also explores a career in teaching, when she finishes school herself. She continues to learn a lot through Emma, over several years, as life (of course) continues to have many ups and downs.The film is a beautiful love story about life, love, sex and growing up and finding one's self. The explicit sex scenes didn't bother me at all and I thought they were done in a tasteful way (that wasn't gratuitous at all). Three hours seems like an over-long running length for a movie like this but it flies by. For me the film felt a lot faster paced than a 'HOBBIT' or 'LORD OF THE RINGS' movie (or just about any film with a comparable running length). That says a lot about how well it's written and directed. There has been some controversy about how much the director pushed the actors and crew but (as far as the quality of the film is concerned) it seems to have paid off. The performances are all great (especially the two leads) and the overall movie is a satisfying and unique film going experience; one that shouldn't be missed!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x-FDEJ5nhQ",

            "content": "I must admit that this lesbian movie was quite impressive than any gay theme movie ever I saw. It gave equal preferences to elements in the story. I mean it did not lean on the only sexual side, but emerged to explore on the emotional side as well. It briefs how hard a life as a gay and within that relationship problems like regular ones.The director used some of the outstanding tricks to capture many great scenes for the movie. Looked everything was realistic and natural including sleeping, fighting and street walking scenes and of course sexual intercourse. Yeah, it had too strong sex scenes like Steve McQueen's 'Shame' and I was shocked for its rawness. It shows how todays director's are fearless to show what they really wanted in their films.Like the original French title say 'La Vie D'ad\u00e8le: Chapters 1 and 2' this movie divides its story telling into two parts. The first one reveals the journey of character Ad\u00e8le to find what really she is and another spills the seriousness of its reality. Sometime we won't understand the reason for path we're choosing to travel in life. Once we're into it the after effects will teach more about the truth. This movie was rendered in such concept.Ad\u00e8le was the center of the attraction. It was her real name as well the screen name. Every youngster will fall for her incredible innocent performance and for her wild beauty, especially for her rabbit teeth. There are many reasons why it was called Blue, As many of us believed because of blue hair of character Emma. But Emma comes somewhere middle of the story and later on she vanishes till the beginning of the ending. I thought maybe because of Ad\u00e8le who wore a blue dress at the end, which warms her (life) after the disastrous previous years.The aggressive sex scenes from the movie drawn the barrier from the Oscar. Otherwise, this movie would have done great in 2014 Academy Awards. It is not fair to let it go because of the plot it deals, there's many things in it like life and relationship. If you are successful you will get the movie's message at the end with your sympathy and tenderness.",

When \"Saw\" first came out, all I remember knowing about that film was that a guy had to cut his leg off at the end. I still haven't seen \"Basic Instinct\", but I know it's famous for the scene where Sharon Stone crosses her leg. This film, in much the same way, is famous for its gratuitous and graphic lesbian sex scenes, and I wont lie to you: the sex scenes are graphic, they are lengthy, and I'm sure had I watched this with anyone else, it might've made viewing this film a little uncomfortable. But while sex is a prominent topic in this movie, it is not the only thing this movie speaks to; it's also about self-discovery and self-love, finding yourself and growing up through making mistakes and just taking chances. This is a movie that fully embraces the messiness of love and it understands the difficulties of learning how to accept who you are as a person.Yes, there are some very lengthy sex scenes; yes, they are quite explicit; but, yes, they also serve a purpose. If you take issue with sexual content in films, then don't watch this film; you wont enjoy it. But if you can look past the nudity to see that what the director is trying to portray is not pornographic, but a raw and real look at a very passionate and powerful relationship. The sex doesn't glorify lust; it exudes love with every brush of skin and sharp gasp for air.",

It has the longest and most explicit sex scene that I have seen in some 50 years of viewing movies.The story is one of love found and love lost between a teenage schoolgirl Ad\u00e8le (Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos) and a little older art student blue-haired Emma (L\u00e9a Seydoux) as directed by Franco-Tunisian Abdellatif Kechiche. The relationship between the actors and director has been complex and controversial: script and scenes evolved fluidly as the production proceeded, shooting was prolonged and repetitive (that sex sequence took 10 days), and both women have publicly complained over the tyrannical approach of Kechiche. Then Julie Maroh, who wrote the original graphic novel that inspired the movie, has dismissed this adaptation as a straight person's fantasy of gay love.So this is a controversial film at several levels. But the result of all this creative tension is a powerful and compelling work with superb acting by Seydoux and a truly stunning performance from 18 year old Exarchopoulos. The whole film has a naturalistic feel about it, whether the leads are conversing or coupling, and the ambiguous ending seems so right.",

It was a depiction of the ultimate love story, the Titanic and Brokeback Mountain involving two girls love story.When I watched the movie however, it was a total let down. Even if you hadn't read the novel and distanced yourself from it, on it's own, a lot of things didn't make any sense. For example, Ad\u00e8le never seems to really figure out what she really wants. She is roaming around, looking for love, having sex with a guy and then finding out that she likes women, notably Emma, the blue haired girl. She may have figured that she is bisexual, but she's not sure.As for the relationship between Ad\u00e8le and Emma, love seems to be completely absent, and is replaced with aggressive lust, desperate co-dependence and un-fulfillment.Another problem I had with the movie was the extremely long shots. A lot of scenes could have been cut short, especially the sex scene. Unlike in the novel, where they are both upset and declare their love for each other crying and have passionate sex, in the film they are under a tree and share a little kiss and then in the next scene they are both naked and holding each other. Thus begins the painfully long and pornographic sex positions between the two girls. It looked very much like it was made for the male gaze. For me, as an out lesbian woman, with everything else in the film trying to be as real as possible, the scenes just looked too far fetched for me.The only scenes that felt real were the fight scenes and the break up scene, which was very emotional and powerful. In conclusion, a lot of it felt quite dull, but ultimately very well shot and acted.",

I watch a few clips of the film on YouTube. I decided that I had to see this film.What I loved about this film was how real it seemed. Adele Exarchopoulos, who played Adele, was splendid. I felt her actions, either verbally or non-verbal, were all on point. For instance, when she was first kissed by a girl at school, her actions after the kiss, looking away/looking stunned, were all natural reactions. Her crying was so well timed as well. It so convincing and I have a lot of respect for her performance in this film.There were four scenes in this film that really caught my attention. Two of them, when Adele and Emma first meet at the bar and their break-up scene, were great. The two best scenes were when Adele was ostracized by her high school friends and the other was the house party scene with Emma's friends all coming over. The first scene I just mentioned, Adele being ostracized, was full of emotion. These girls were really going at it and it felt as real as any fight you see in your lifetime that isn't portrayed on a projector. I was caught up in that scene and I attributed the great acting in that scene.The other scene that I co-loved the best was the party that Adele and Emma had with Emma's friends and paintings. It is a painful/emotional scene to watch. It is funny typing this, because it seemed like a joyous time in the film, but Adele was clearly uncomfortable being around Emma's friends. It wasn't like Emma's friends were mean to Adele, she just didn't have anything in common with Emma's friends. With the artsy conversations, the setting, the mood, this scene was Fellini-esque.I have to say the sex scenes were over the top. I didn't know that this film had scenes like this, so I was surprised. The amount and length was too much. That is subjective because I'm just not in to that type of stuff when it comes to watching a movie.There so much more I would like to describe, but I will end by saying that my descriptions probably will only harm the film. It is a beautiful movie and worth watching.",

At over three hours, it is as tedious as that line might sound to more cynical ears. The hype about this being a politically correct, right-on approach to female homosexuality is exactly that: just hype. The way it is shot is a smooth revamp of what feminists used to call 'the male gaze'. Nothing innovative about it: same old 'girls on film' that Bertolucci might have shot in the 1970s, complete with lots of close-ups of mouths slurping pasta. In an age when 'lesbian sex' is probably one of the most popular search terms on Google, the whole thing struck me as trendy posturing about sexuality as a pretext to show naked women writhing and stroking. And, the girls are both lovely (as well as great actresses, by the way). As soft porn goes, it is not bad - right up there with Courbet and David Hamilton, which is why I give it a 6, and not a lesser score. Now, what REALLY annoyed me is the long-long-winded lengths to which the director goes to disguise his sexploitation tactics with edgy, jerky, quasi-documentary depictions of daily existence in urban France (sanitized into a racial paradise, where every scene contains Africans and Arabs living in perfect harmony with their white countrymen), which aesthetic he clearly ripped off from films by the Dardenne brothers and/or Ursula Meier's \"L'enfant d'en haut\" (a brilliant film, which also features actress L\u00e9a Seydoux).

I hate everything about them, particularly the fact that so many people associate this film predominantly with them. They are completely unnecessary, totally gratuitous and uncomfortably long. The tension and attraction between Adele and Emma is so intense that there is no need for any sex scenes. And certainly not like this. It is cheap, indulgent and, for many, abusive.It is particularly maddening that Abdellatif Kechiche would insult us with this misplaced because the rest of the film is absolutely flawless.

I am a much more cynical person now. The film is a three hour character study of this teen aged girl called Adele (Adele Exarchopoulos). It covers her awakening sexuality, her first two relationships and subsequent breakups. Adele's performance is exceptional. But the director does so many close ups of her, her endearing pout becomes irritating and she comes across as a slut after a certain point. All the performances including Lea Seydoux were exceptional.The film does beat its breasts about the discriminations faced by the protagonists. Adele gets into a street fight with a classmate/friend who is rather rude to her about her new relationship. A bit hard to believe that this would happen in a liberal nation like France (I could be wrong of course). But the scene was quite contrived. That angry girl who confronted Adele came out of nowhere. And her outrage seemed completely fake.The sex scenes were intense. I wonder if they were real. But I have seen better in pornographic films. The sex scenes and the breakup scene were extremely well acted. Once again, exceptional acting by both the leads.The interactions between the various characters were realistic. The dialogues were like real people would talk, they are devoid of sharpness or punctuation. I found this to be quite boring especially since this is a 3 hour film. Just 3 hours of a teenager who aspires to become a teacher talking realistically to people. Yeah the sex scenes were there.I found the scenes with Adele attending a protest to be a bit immature (though maybe that was the point). Though I was quite fascinated by the liberal French culture which Adele enjoyed.I have not read the books discussed in the film - like Life of Marianne and the ones by Sartre.Best Regards, Pimpin.(5/10)",

Not even a single time.There is no apprehension as to why Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos & Lea Seydoux shared the Golden Palm at Cannes. The former, so boldly carries the character that I feel no other person could do it as realistically as she did. Her relation with her hair, her locks, her feelings, her dance moves, her sexual orientation is all so finely reproduced that I sat nonplussed as to how can someone so young get into a character so deeply. And the single dimple on her cheek is the icing on the cake. Coming to Lea, girl, what a portrayal. Of a mature tomboy understanding each & every aspect of the things life puts in front of her. Her eyes talk more than her mouth and I love that hairdo, really. The chemistry between these two is perfectly shot with brilliant cinematography & photography.How the camera shifts to the part of scene it actually wants us to see is terrific. Not giving out the plot as it is, but asking us to dive deep into the conversations is why the film stands out this awards season. Yet it is so real & relatable, you will gasp for tediousness, that is if you are exposed to typical Hollywood stereotypes.No. This one shuns all the electrotypes there is regarding the explosive subject. It is an impeccable epitome for people having questions about their orientation and how they could move \"out and on.\" The love factor has never been so durably flexed out. How teens feel about relationships is also a thing it throws light on. It will help you realize. I am proud of the direction as he's come out of the shell to deliver. The music & soundtrack is so in line with the happenings and Lykke Li's I Follow Rivers is the best song of the lot. LGBT rallies, total (doggone) nudity, explicit references, bold art, artists and profound sampling of themes form the base of this film which has everything warm about it. The climax may not be everyone's essay topic, but it does refer to some closure. Although, the real sense should be oozed out \"off\" the body of this femme fatale of a movie.BOTTOM LINE: Blue Is The Warmest Color is one of my favorite films this year that speaks volumes.

Perhaps it did, for as I left, I often turned around to see the young girl I left behind without knowing I did so for her. Her heart was missing something.\nWhen you exchange glances, when you cross paths and you both exchange glances spontaneously, like with love at first sight, is there something less or more.

The confusion of our early awakening sexuality, our search for identity and place in the world, the shock of discovery of true passion, losing oneself in another, young love and then deep love. Our identity entwined with another's, the building of balance and union, partnership and security, and endless days of joy.And from this grows a curiosity about limits, about life, about other possibilities. And then the surprise of carelessness, mistake, and tragedy. The profound pain, the agony that goes on, and never really ends. Longing and wishing and regret, which slowly dulls and is covered by busy-ness and life.And always, all your life, you remember and ache as you re-live those days, first true love, held inside, honoured but faded.And I am very lucky, for in this movie I re-lived all of this, all those memories awakened, those feelings and passions and joys, in this masterpiece of acting and writing and camera and direction.

            "content": "This film is recommended.Abdellatif Kechiche directed and co-wrote this graphic and lengthy treatise about young love and all of its emotional intensities. Starring Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos and L\u00e9a Seydoux as the two female lovers, Ad\u00e8le and Emma, the film comes off as well-done soft porn with a higher degree of sophistication due to a literate screenplay and the uninhibited central performances of the two leads.The film uses the theme of predestination and love at first sight in telling the story of Adele's coming out. The minimal plot serves as a mere outline for this love story between a teenage girl who becomes enamored with an older woman. Young Adele sees Emma, a blue haired beauty, and instantly is attracted to this spirited object of desire. So begins the courtship and commitment of these two lesbian women as they consummate their love affair, from their first kiss to their parting embrace.As we watch the beginnings of her relationship with Emma unfold, we see Adele mature from a 17 year-old girl to a young adult and become more accepting her own sexual orientation. The earlier portion of the film is more successful as the director expertly captures the life of a modern day teenager with his subtle observations of youthful exuberance, moments of unbridled curiosity and passion, frustration and sexual confusion, and judgmental peer pressure. As the years pass, Blue is the Warmest Color becomes more episodic. We see these two women coming together and growing apart. The film tends to over-intellectualize as the film progresses and become too philosophical for its own good. It also allows the explicit sexual encounters to go on far too long. Less would have been more effective.Blue is the Warmest Color is a detailed character study about a young girl's fancy with a fancy young girl. The sexual scenes are explicit and the nudity, while not gratuitous, is more often unashamedly candid in its treatment, presenting an accurate and honest modern day depiction of gay life. Both Ms. Exarchopoulos and Ms. Seydoux won the Palme de'Or award at the Cannes Film Festival and deliver bold and unflinching performances as the lovers in a free-fall relationship. The young Ms. Exarchopoulos is particularly riveting as Ad\u00e8le.However, the film truly needs more concise editing as it tends ramble and overstate their passion while losing some impact as the film reaches its foregone conclusion. At three hours, Blue is the Warmest Color starts to become a tad lukewarm. The film reiterates the troubles of their conflicting personalities within their promising relationship once too often, dissipating the overall effect.Blue is the Warmest Color is a bold voyeuristic journey for any moviegoer but only the most liberal-minded viewer will able to fully enjoy the final NC-17 results. Others might be put off by the subject and the film's excessive length, but I found Blue is the Warmest Color to be provocative and insightful, boasting two of the strongest performances by any actress this year.

            "content": "\"Blue is the Warmest Color\" deliberately swims in unsafe waters to emerge above the usual movies about homosexuality, but the artistic licenses of competent (and straight) director AbdellatifKechiche prevented a good story from drawing a larger and diverse audience. I don't mind graphic sexuality and one pour of raw emotion can never hurt a movie but talk about overplaying it. There's so much sex that the line between a fascinating life immersion and a sordid fixation on female anatomic details is crossed, and more than once. Ironically, there's something so honest and bold in the performances of Adele Exarchopoulos (Adele) and Lea Seydoux (Emma) that they almost unveiled the calculating nerve of a director who knew the film would need a little extra kick to be more than a lesbian romance, as if the romance wasn't enough. His sex scenes venture so much in the realm of pornography it's hard not to imagine someone licking his upper lip behind the camera. I'm not even accusing Kechiche, his actresses did, denouncing a climate of pressure that confined to harassment. Kechiche became the villain, to the point he wished the film wasn't released. And today's context of harassment' accusations spreading all over Hollywood gives a whole new perspective.It's only fair to use the context. The film was released after the legalization in France of same-sex marriage and the Golden Palm Award played like an official stance. During the promotional days, the two lead actresses were asked to comment on some statement from Christine Boutin, a French politician notoriously opposed to gay marriage, their answers can be found of Youtube, it was one of the reasons I didn't watch the film. Adjani would have spoken, these girls spontaneously raised their middle finger and it didn't really encourage me to watch the film. Still, the middle finger was a honest representation of Hollywood liberals' answer to \"conservative bigots\". But can't also this film serve as an illustration of actresses' needless over-sexualization, especially coming from a straight director?If you're telling me that there were 800 hours of footage, I wonder what the proportion of the sexual material was. Many questions are to be raised on that matter, would have Kechiche been as artistically zealous about men? I can't speak for him, but being a straight male, I would have probably skipped any love scenes with my remote control, I felt guilty I was actually aroused by the sex scenes. The film is in fact good, and sex is integral to its quality, but there's \"sex scene\" and \"sex scene\", and less would have been more. In the end of the first intercourse, there's a brief moment where the two young girls lie in bed in a position that reminded of a beautiful moment in \"Five Easy Pieces\", it allowed Adele to be staring at Emma's body and there was something fascinating in the way she looked at her sex and how she gently caressed her leg, like an intimate realization, that moment alone spoke more than any licking or humping.And just when you thought the movie would dig deeper into their relationships, it returned to sex, over and over again... while there was so much more to appreciate, Kechiche's insistence on sex stole the thunder of one of the most powerful and realistic romances of recent times. I felt really empathetic toward the insecurities of Adele and the way she eluded any attempt to admit she had more than a fling on Emma, the character of Emma and how she never took crap in the name of love, the differences between the two girls and how it affected their social and professional life, one as a teacher, one as a wannabe artist, how it affected their relationships with friends and family.In fact, the realism of the film is so striking that it's only when you realize there's nothing 'special' about it that you find out this is what makes it exceptional, but its own enemy was Kechiche who deliberately wanted to make something exceptionally graphic as if he didn't trust his material enough. And that's a shame because the film didn't need that; it is overly long while it could have better had it trimmed at least fifteen minutes of erotica.There's that Howard Hawks' quote I often mention in my reviews: a good film is three great scenes and no bad scenes, there are three magnificent scenes in the film, one where Adele is verbally harassed by a group of friends, pushed to admit that she's lesbian, implicating a response of hostility forcing her to deny it as a defense mechanism, Adele is a nice person who finds herself entrapped in her desire to a keep a low profile and her personal impulses.There's the beautiful park scene where there's no body language is enough to show the growing love between the two women, and finally, there's the argument near the end and it felt so real that for one moment I didn't know whom to root for, it was time for Adele to grow up and stop relying of victimization and defensiveness. The film is never as good a romance as it's a wonderful coming of age story and character studies, especially the titular Adele.Now, there's no bad scene but so overly long sexual scenes that they confine to voyeurism and can affect the film in a negative way. A film about heterosexual people wouldn't have needed so much sex, this one should have subdued it. \"Milk\" and \"Carol\" suggested the intimacy and weren't less powerful. And the problem with \"Blue\" is that sex occupies so much space it contaminates every review and distract from the beautiful relationship it deals with and makes the critics look like homophobic bigots while the overuse of sex was also criticized by gay people. The film was just, needlessly polarizing.",

It is an incredibly crafted epic with remarkable performances by two beautiful young women, Adele Exarchopoulos and Lea Seydoux. The two play opposites who attract one another and begin a lengthy, passionate affair. Their love wears thin when the passion outweighs the emotional and psychological connection between the two and we, as a viewer, begin to realise that their sexual appetite for one another is the only thing their coupling thrives on. Any type of marriage of equals has been put on the back burner. A relationship cannot survive on sex alone, there needs to be a connection on psychological level. Whether there ever was is up to the viewer. The inevitable results and the two go their separate ways, Adele becomes heartbroken and plunges into a depression. Blue is the Warmest Colour was, and seemingly still is, engulfed in a wave of largely unnecessary controversy. Most of the controversy lies within the sex scenes. Many have labeled them exploitive, pornographic, and voyeuristic. None of these apply to any scenes of a sexual nature in this film. Instead, they are realistic and full of passion. We have become too accustomed to \"clean\" and \"comfortable\" sexuality on screen, frustratingly perpetuated by mainstream American cinema. Sex is NOT a clean act in essence, it involves all sorts of bodily functions and fluids. This film does not present sex in a family friendly matter (nor do they make up an excessive portion of the film) and that's why these scenes aren't problematic for me. The girls don't make love with their clothes or undergarments on. Their love making is real, beautiful, fervent, unguarded and natural. Just like the film itself. 10/10.",

I find it quite hard to say what it is about without the summary sounding banal. Adele is a confused girl, unfulfilled in her life, trying to figure out what she desires. Then, girl meets girl, girl likes girl, girl falls for girl, and girl's relationship with girl follows its destined course. In the meantime, girl comes to grips with her desire, sexuality and identity. But it is poignant, sweet, sad, unflinching,The more naive and inexperienced of the two is Adele, played by Adele Exarchopoulos. She does a wonderful job of being both unsure and youthfully headstrong. I enjoyed her character being so blase about pretenses and frivolity in the superficial. She is hilarious to watch eat food, Adele ravenously devours meals as if her appetite for sustenance is insatiable. Emma, played by Lea Seydoux, is the slightly older college student who Adele befriends, at first as a confidante and mild mentor, but soon that friendship evolves. Emma is free-spirited and confident without being pretentious or judgmental and Seydoux's character warrants Adele's infatuation.The film is raw, the sex scenes enthralling without being gratuitous and what you get essentially from Blue is the Warmest Color is a coming of age lesbian love story.More reviews at our website :)",

            "content": "In French this film was simply entitled \"La Vie d'Ad\u00e8le \u2013 Chapitres 1 & 2\" (\"The Life of Adele \u2013 Chapters 1 & 2\"), but this was changed to something more oblique in English. I wondered if this change was made so that cinema-goers did not wander in thinking that they were going to see a biopic of the British singer, but in fact \"Blue Is the Warmest Colour\" was the name of the graphic novel on which it is based.Ad\u00e8le is a 17-year-old French schoolgirl who becomes involved in a lesbian relationship with a blue-haired art student named Emma. As the French title might suggest, the film falls into two parts. The first is a standard coming-of-age drama in which Ad\u00e8le discovers her sexuality after meeting, befriending and falling in love with Emma; the two eventually enter into a relationship. The second part takes place several years later. (We see nothing of the characters' lives during the intervening period). Ad\u00e8le is now herself a school teacher. At the beginning of Part 2 Ad\u00e8le and Emma (now an aspiring painter and no longer blue-haired) are still together, but it is clear that tensions are starting to arise in their relationship. Eventually, Emma throws Ad\u00e8le out of their apartment after discovering that Ad\u00e8le (who is bisexual rather than exclusively gay) has slept with a man. The film then explores what happens to them following their break-up.The film was controversial when released in 2013 because of the lengthy sex scenes between its two heroines. (Some America commentators have also tried to generate controversy based on the fact that Ad\u00e8le is under eighteen when she first sleeps with Emma, but little has been made of this aspect in France where the age of consent is lower). These scenes are certainly highly explicit, but I think that they can be justified on the basis of what they reveal about Emma and Ad\u00e8le. Theirs is a relationship based around a powerful mutual erotic attraction, not simply around an affectionate friendship. It is the fact that their relationship is so strongly centred on sex which explains why it is so difficult for them to maintain it after they discover that they have little in common. It also explains, however, why the temptation persists to revive that relationship after they have ended it, and even after Emma has found a new partner.Another theme explored in the film is that of social class and social outlook. Two important scenes are those in which Ad\u00e8le and Emma invite one another to have dinner with their respective families. Emma can be quite open with her unconventional, Bohemian middle-class family about the nature of her relationship with Ad\u00e8le, whereas Ad\u00e8le feels unable to be so frank about her sexuality with her more socially conservative working-class parents, and passes Emma off as one of her teachers, claiming that the two are just friends. These inherited differences in outlook persist throughout their time together and are a factor in their break-up. Emma is always the more intellectual of the two, wishing her lover were something more glamorous than a teacher and trying to persuade Ad\u00e8le to take up a career as a writer. Ad\u00e8le in turn feels out of place in the artistic circles in which Emma moves.What most surprised me about the film was its length, weighing in at just a minute short of three hours, considerably longer than your average coming-of-age movie and of a length I would more normally associate with grand epics, action films and musicals than with something as intimate as this. I felt that it was excessively long, that the pace tended to drag at times and that director Abdellatif Kechiche could easily have shortened it considerably without sacrificing too much.Nevertheless, what redeems the film is the intensity and passion which its two lead actresses, Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos and future Bond Girl L\u00e9a Seydoux, bring to their roles. Despite the explicit love scenes, it would be wrong to see \"Blue Is the Warmest Colour\" as disguised soft-core erotica. It is film about two very believable characters whom we can identify with and an exploration of the joys and pains of love, as relevant to a heterosexual audience as to a lesbian one. 7/10 A goof. At one point Ad\u00e8le states that her name derives from the Arabic for \"Justice\". In fact the name Ad\u00e8le, cognate with the English Ethel, is derived from the German for \"noble\".",

It takes a subject that many people would unfortunately be uncomfortable with and depicts it in an honest and loving manner, wanting to show that love knows no boundaries.The film follows Adele, a French teen who becomes attracted to another woman after having an unsuccessful relationship with a boy. Adele meets the blue-haired woman, named Emma, at a lesbian bar and the two quickly become friends. Soon they begin a loving and passionate relationship that lasts several years in which they live with each other and frequently make love. The sex scenes in this film are actually quite crucial to the development of the relationship between Adele and Emma. Though they are quite graphic, they never actually feel pornographic or exploitative. There is a genuine sense of love and passion within those moments that adds to the film's overall theme of love as a powerful unbiased force.Another theme within this film is the dynamic of relationships and personalities. At one point in the film, Adele has a brief affair with a male that destroys her relationship with Emma. She had been in a relationship with a male before meeting Emma, but ended it due to her dissatisfaction with the relationship. Later on, Adele tries to reconnect with Emma, but they remain separated because Emma no longer feels passion between them. We as an audience are never given a complete definition of Adele's sexuality and it is uncertain if the two will ever see or speak to each other again.Blue Is the Warmest Color is a strong, honest, and emotionally devastating film that does not hold back in its message of love and equality. It is a powerful film, and I highly recommend it to anyone who would like to learn about the ways of love and passion in both same-sex and heterosexual relationships.",

            "content": "Based on a graphic novel, \"Blue\" compresses (if that's the right word for a film that lasts three hours) eight or so years in the life of Ad\u00e8le, a grade-school teacher in Lille, in northern France, into a series of richly textured episodes. She meets her long-term partner, Emma, while she's still in high school. Ad\u00e8le is sensitive, emotional\u2014maybe to a fault\u2014and eager for love. Emma's an art student, older, savvier, already on the fast track to a career as a painter. Their affair is passionate\u2014the strenuous-looking sex scenes may have gotten too much attention\u2014but the contrasts in their backgrounds and temperaments begin to push them apart... Maybe it's my prejudice, but I found it interesting that Emma, despite her blue hair and her sexual orientation, comes off as a careerist and a bit of a hipster conformist whereas Ad\u00e8le seems self-invented and original. Ad\u00e8le gives a heartfelt speech early on about a novel she's reading in school; Emma's paintings are skillful but facile and trendy, and the first time they talk in a bar, she gives Ad\u00e8le a little canned lecture on Sartre that seems straight out of Wikipedia. Interesting how Ad\u00e8le settles into the old-fashioned role of artist's muse and mistress\u2014when Emma gets her diploma and they throw a big party, it's Ad\u00e8le that ladles out the pasta while Emma talks smack about Klimt and Schiele with her art-school cronies. This is a subtle and compelling movie; we thought we'd watch it in two installments, at least, but the three-hour running time was not a problem. We'll probably watch it again before too long. Made me wish I understood French better (\"Tu bois de la Goudale; c'est la bi\u00e8re des goudos\"\u2014say what?). Btw, I'd like to propose a moratorium on reviews containing phrases like \"I want the last *insert running time of film in hours or minutes* of my life back,\" or is that too radical a notion?",

The production tried to clock in on the success of Spectre (2015) were L\u00e9a Seydoux is playing Dr. Madeleine Swann. In La Vie D'Adele she's playing a lesbian teenager. So far so good wasn't it for the fact that the sex scene's between the two teenage lesbians are rather explicit. But before you perverts go out to see this flick be advised that it did remind me a bit of the films from Larry Clarck. There's a lot of talking going on and just like in Clarck's flicks when teenagers are going fr sex it becomes a bit weird for some because it's explicit and done by teens or girls in their twenties. But on the other hand those flicks aren't easy to watch, this one here clocks in at almost 3 hours. It goes deep into the characterisation of Adele. Starting of at the age of 18 when she's falling in love with a guy and again, having sex with him (explicit) she do discover that guys aren't her thing. So slowly she becomes friends with Emma, a lesbian which she falls in love with. Of course at school she does get it the hard way being a lesbian and she do knows that it won't be accepted by her parents so it's off she goes living together with Emma. But as it goes with puberty, she do discover her sexuality and falls in love again with a guy. The duration doesn't makes it an easy flick to watch and the lesbian scene's can be shocking for some to watch and I can understand why it was taken out of theaters as quickly as possible. Of course a nice promotion by doing so...Gore 0/5 Nudity 5/5 Effect 0/5 Story 4/5 Comedy 0/5",

            "content": "Last year's Palme d'or winner, the much-hyped French lesbian drama directed by Abdellatif Kechiche, about a high-schooler, Ad\u00e8le (Exarchopoulos)'s discovery of her sexuality through a heartfelt relationship with Emma (Seydoux), an art college student, it is a visceral rite-of- passage eloquently elaborated in 179 minutes, details a thoroughly poignant metamorphosis of Ad\u00e8le, from green adolescence to womanhood, and under the parameter of Kechiche's truth- capture tack, unyielding close-ups and hand-held cameras faithfully records the normality of Ad\u00e8le's daily life. It is a mundane love story but is told with utter finery from sterling performances of the two leads (much hyped by their explicit and elongated sex activities) to the sensational evocation to one's own crazy first love, revels in a spur-of-the-moment passion, explores all the possibilities for pleasure, falls for another unconditionally, dwells in a nothing-to-lose pipe dream and suffers the ugly consequences, it is a luxury which unfortunately not everyone has the chance to experience, moreover, a more essential lesson is to find who you are, a phase everyone has to undergo through, but the sooner the better, at the very least in the coda, Ad\u00e8le has her youth and many opportunities await. The most controversial talking point of the film is its graphic depiction of lesbian sex, personally it is a quite eye-dropping introduction for me, and it is a daring commitment for the two actresses, but narratively speaking, it cannot be entirely dismissed as a cunning stratagem to attract at least a vast heterosexual male demography for the sake of truth-revealing authenticity, as far as I know, there could be more male-repellent sex actions between lesbians which Kechiche purposefully dodges to show on screen, at least on the sex-appeal, it is tacitly (straight) male-friendly. Yet being a man inherently cannot be distracted by girl-on-girl sex, the film still works for me mostly owing to Exarchopoulos and Seydoux's intrepid output on screen, Seydoux impersonates an androgynous tomboy with a glamorous lure coherently justifies Ad\u00e8le's disadvantaged position it this relationship, Emma is older and more worldly, their breakup is not a passion act, indeed, Emma is wise enough to realise that as an aspiring artist, she cannot garner instant success with a girlfriend only being a nursery teacher, the void gap on their common ground about art is partially detrimental too, so she is slyly waiting for a chance to dump Ad\u00e8le, that's why she overacts and completely changes into another person in the falling-out scenes, because she cannot miss this golden opportunity and shovel the blame to Ad\u00e8le for being a slut, anyone can sense the nuance when her trademark blue hair dyed in blonde, the shift is in the offing. As she admits several years later in the cafeteria, she does't love her anymore, the sexual libido still resides between them but by then it cannot sustain a relationship by that alone. Ad\u00e8le learns her lesson in a hard way, but it is crucial and beneficial for her blossoming into an adult, Exarchopoulos radiates throughout in the once-in-a-lifetime role and is particularly excellent when conveying her transition during the time-span of the film, as if three-hours is not enough for audience to witness her growth in front of our eyes simply because we project too much compassion thanks to her indomitable presence, it is a blessing for her since first love is immensely valuable because it doesn't last forever, and we all live and learn by that. It is a giant stepping stone for Exarchopoulos' booming acting career, one do hope she will not be a flash in the pan. In any rate, this film is an exuberant dissection of a girl's self-reliant saga of growing up, visually expressive and sincerely thought-provoking, Kechiche is definitely on my radar after this.",

            "content": "I didn't get as much out of this film as some although I think it does some things very well.But the main thing this work made me think about was the degree to which I was qualified to judge it. It's a meditation by Abdellatif Kechiche, a male (and, I'm guessing, heterosexual) writer-director on the differences in the ways men and women experience love and sex. It follows several years in the lives of two lesbian lovers, Adele and Emma, who meet when the former is in her teens and the latter in her early twenties. I can't say the relationship struck me particularly realistic or believable, but who am I to evaluate such a depiction as I am male and have thus never loved as a woman, have never had a homosexual relationship, and, to be a bit confessional, did not have any serious heterosexual relationships until I was older than Adele is (early to mid twenties) even by the end of the film? Yet, the auteur has no experience of at least the first, and it seems to me, most significant of these experiences and I questioned several times Kechiche's qualifications to depict this relationship. Can any depiction of lesbian love by a male artist be genuine, especially one this sexually charged? Here's what I think is impressive about the film. At first, the storytelling struck me as very straightforward, even unimaginative. But then I picked up on its uniquely subtle way of conveying the passage of time. Years pass within the narrative with straight cuts and no direct way of knowing that any substantial time has passed from the last scene, less how much time. The viewer is clued into the nature of its narrative time only through the behavior of the two central characters, or really, I would say, the film's sole central character, Adele (more on that later). This forces us to focus on the film's central theme: the way the relationships we choose shape our other decisions and gradually mold who we become (or don't become) over the course of time. None of this would be successfully conveyed if not for the extraordinary performance of Adele Exarchopoulos who fleshes out Adele's transition from adolescent to adult with exceptional subtlety and complexity. Watching the film, I was convinced Exarchopoulos had to be in her late twenties and doing a brilliant job of playing a teenager in the film's early scenes. The revelation that she is in fact a teenager playing a grown woman in the film's later scenes makes the performance all the more remarkable.Now we come to what I liked about the film that makes me scrutinize myself. Much has been written about the extremely graphic nature of the film's sex scenes, most of them between Adele and Emma. Watching them, I felt that for such graphic cinematic depictions of sex they were unique in not feeling \"pornographic\", and let me explain exactly what I mean by that. Even an \"artistic\" film of great sexual graphicness, such as \"In the Realm of the Senses,\" feels somewhat pornographic in the sense that it is going to great lengths to hold up sex-as-spectacle. The sex in \"Blue is the Warmest Color\" seemed to me, as I viewed it, an essential part of trying to understand the particular relationship that develops between Adele and Emma which is, they both make clear in words as well as deeds, hinged first and foremost on their sexual chemistry. (Here just a quick note: the longest sex scene depicts Adele's and Emma's first time together. I found it romanticized and unrealistic that a first time between any two partners, particularly when one is as young and inexperienced as Adele, could be THAT mind-blowing, but then maybe I am prejudiced by the limitations of my own experiences...)But here, too, I feel the need to interrogate myself. As a hetero-male viewer I greatly, ummm, enjoyed these scenes, and I probably feel the need to tell myself my pleasure was mainly \"cultural.\" I couldn't help but wonder if Kechiche hadn't, ummm, enjoyed directing those scenes. I don't mean that to sound accusatory (even if the two actresses' accusations about Kechiche's behavior on the set are disturbing). I think that Kechiche's motivations at least could have been quite brave- an attempt to affirmatively depict a kind of love he can never know. But did he question his motivations for directing these scenes? I couldn't be sure. And how could he not question the motivations of his audience (uh, like me) for watching them? Now for the aspects of the film that just plain disappointed me: The fact that Adele emerges as such a fully-drawn character is all the more remarkable because she exists, she transforms, in relation to Emma, who barely deserves to be called a character. I am surprised and disappointed that more critics haven't pointed this out. It is no fault of Lea Seydoux, the actress who plays Emma. Seydoux does a fine job with a terribly written part. But Emma is not just a clich\u00e9- a Sartre quoting French \"intellectual\"- but a clich\u00e9 that transforms at the convenience and whimsy of the narrative. She is whatever the writers need her to be to bring Adele where they want her to go.The other thing that disturbed me about the film in relation to the degree of its accolades is that it seemed terribly dated. Again, its theme is the way human responsibility must be acknowledged despite the random nature of the happening of life, and the unknowable nature of (the many forms of) the Other. Sartre is invoked repeatedly in the dialogue, and somehow I don't think Sartre is what's hot with contemporary French intellectuals. The film at times addresses these themes quite touchingly, but these are themes that were treated to death by French literature and cinema in the '40s and '50s, having, I thought, become pass\u00e9 even by the inauguration of the New Wave.",

Following a short-lived romance with handsome classmate Thomas (Jeremie Laheurte), Adele soon finds herself she has more feelings for women especially after she meets a blue-haired fine arts student named Emma (Lea Seydoux) at a lesbian bar. Both of them eventually become lovers. At the beginning, their relationship is fulfilling but as years goes by with Adele becoming a kindergarten teacher, everything starts to feel different than they used to be.THE GOOD STUFFDirector Abdellatif Kechiche's penchant for relentless close-ups, as well as his attention to detail is visually captivating. The story -- adapted from Julie Maroh's Le Bleu est une couleur chaude comic book -- is equally stunning where Kechiche embraces the lesbian theme with the utmost passionate and heartfelt manner.But the movie, of course, is best remembered for its few graphic sex scenes where Kechiche is daring enough to push the boundaries of the NC-17 rating. Equally remarkable as well are the two central performances from Adele Exarchopoulos and Lea Seydoux. Exarchopoulos, in particular, is tour de force especially the way she conveys her varied emotion beneath her shy-looking exterior.MOST MEMORABLE MOMENT(S)The first sexual encounter between Adele and Emma -- one of the most explicit and passionate sex scenes ever put into film.THE BAD STUFFAt three hours long, the movie can be a test of patience to watch this in one sitting. Not surprisingly, most of the scenes feel unnecessarily overlong. It is understandable that Abdellatif Kechiche wants to unfold his movie as naturalistic as possible, but it would be more appreciated if he practices a sense of restraint with a little cinematic term called \"editing\".FINAL WORDSWhile BLUE IS THE WARMEST COLOR isn't exactly a masterpiece at all, this French lesbian drama remains one of the best movies of the year.",

Symbolically it addresses acceptance both in sexuality and self. Adele feels socially isolated until she gets involved in a brief failed relationship with a male. Feeling dissatisfied a friend takes her to a gay bar and this eventually leads to an encounter with Emma whom enchants her. Adele soon graduates and becomes a kindergarten teacher. Emma graduates fine arts and concentrates on painting. Director Abdellatif Kechiche creates a controversial film with a detailed screenplay focusing on one's wrestling with sexuality. There are a few sex scenes between the two leads that is graphic to the point of being pornographic with arms, legs, torsos, and mouths upon every inch that can be located on a body. This will turn off certain viewers but the screenplay merges ahead allowing themes to develop beyond peepshow potential. Adele Exarchopoulos gives a vulnerable performance as a woman struggling with sexual identity. Lea Seydoux is equally strong as the bold and outgoing Emma whose confidence carries Adele. It is her self confidence that influences but she also has a talent for art as well. There are numerous strong supporting characters but all exist in and around the two leads. This is a daring and sometimes explicit film about our comfort zone and whether the warmest colour can maintain its passion. Score: 9 / 10",

            "content": "Blue is the Warmest Colour arrived at a time of intense political discussion around the subject of same-sex marriage in France. So you could say it couldn't have debuted at a better time, with the heated debate so rife making the film that much more poignant and relevant. But when you watch the film, you'll realise that same-sex liberation and equality is really not the purpose nor the drive of this film; Blue is the Warmest Colour is not even remotely militant in its stance aside from an incredibly shot, electrifying gay pride march between the two central characters. What the film focuses on more is the relationship between a shy, confused adolescent from the provincial French city of Lille and an older, wiser and more seasoned art student with blue hair. From the moment the denim vest wearing, punkish Emma meets reserved high schooler Adele, it's literally love (or lust) at first sight. It's not long before Adele's questioning her sexuality, breaking up with her boyfriend (who she is clearly dissatisfied with), and losing touch with her homophobic, scornful best friends.The two women, drawn together like a moth to a flame, are essentially polar opposites. Emma is self-assured and non conformist, while Adele is quiet and more of an observer of her surroundings than Emma, who is more socially and artistically active - as a result, Emma is more in tune with her sexuality and who she is/what she wants, and teaches Adele to assert herself in the same way. Adele was initially in denial about her sexual feelings in the face of unsupported and cliquey girlfriends, but with Emma she's free to comfortably show her true colours - the two walk hand in hand in a gay pride scene, surrounded by other liberated individuals and the freedom of this scene is just radiating.The most remarkable aspect of Blue is the Warmest Color is not the story itself but the transcendent and epic way its depicted. The first love between Emma and Adele is intoxicating and so honestly depicted. I haven't seen a relationship depicted this naturally in an American film for years. The realism and the abundance of free-flowing conversation (a lot of the scenes were improvised) recall the mastery of Bergman. At 173 minutes, the film never feels a minute too long. It's rich and full of life with engaging performances by Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos and L\u00e9a Seydoux. The story will resonate regardless of time and location because it's something we can all connect to. We've all had that first love that becomes the centre of your world, only to be heartbroken and disillusioned when it comes to an end, as it so inevitably does. The endlessly discussed sex scenes only take up about about 10 minutes of what is a three hour film, so I'll refrain from giving them any attention. If the film was just scene after scene of mindless sex, it would be worthy of contention. But the scenes, which are few and far in between, really just accelerate the story - they depict the dizzying passion of the two women, the absolute fever pitch of a relationship between two young women on the cusp of adulthood. The sexual scenes were of such great length because they were so liberating for Adele, they were a defining point in her life (after all, the French title literally translates to \"The Life of Ad\u00e8le\"). She had finally found love that felt right and it was exquisite, cathartic, freeing...An unforgettable film.",

L\u00e9a Seydoux was beautiful and believable too, and the pair make quite a formidable team.

Perhaps the directors cut would resolve some of the only flaws which I noticed - Emma's girlfriend, Sabine, isn't mentioned once Ad\u00e8le and Emma begin their relationship. Which is odd, as it just seems as if she vanishes, rather than the more realistic consequences of what actually happened. Ad\u00e8le never seems to reveal the truth about Emma to her parents, either, which also seems missing from the story.

            "content": "Abdellatif Kechiche's \"Blue is the Warmest Color\" is often a study of facial landscapes. Specifically, that of Adele Exarchopoulos, whose performance is one of great ambiguity. She's the subject of countless close-ups, raw and real, without makeup, which would add a layer of contrivance to the performance.Her character, also named Adele, is confused and lost at the beginning of the film, and still confused and lost when the credits roll three hours later, several years later in narrative time. Such is life. Adele only experiences clarity and certainty while in the throes of passion with her lover, Emma (Lea Seydoux). They devour each other body and soul during drawn-out lovemaking sequences that are, shall we say, rather European in aesthetic. Although some might find them excessive, they aren't purposeless \u2013 the point is to show how moments of ecstasy and grief are inextricably tied to deep, intimate relationships. Kechiche's message? Love is extreme.However, the most striking image in my memory isn't the graphic sex, but a close-up two-shot of the couple's faces, where Emma's crystal- blue eyes are a burst of laser colour against a backdrop of pallid skin and white sheets. As the title suggests, blue is a visual motif throughout the film, and it has classically symbolised both tranquillity and sadness \u2013 more ambiguity. The first time Adele feels homosexual attraction is when she sees the openly gay Emma and her dyed-blue hair, in passing, on the street. The first girl to kiss Adele has chipped blue nail polish. At the end of the movie, Adele wears a blue dress. (Notably, the French title of the film is \"La Vie d'Adele,\" \"The Life of Adele,\" but the English-language title feels like the median between that and the source material, Julie Maroh's graphic novel \"Blue Angel.\")Kechiche reportedly filmed Exarchopoulos in her daily life, while eating, sleeping, taking the train. It's an extreme measure to take in the quest for naturalism, but it works. It has a hint of voyeurism, making the dramatic and mundane moments broodingly real. The consistency of Exarchopoulos' performance makes her characterisation all the more astonishing. She's extraordinary.The story begins when Adele is 17, in high school. She meets a sweet classmate named Samir (Salim Kechiouche), and sleeps with him. But post-coitus, she has an empty look on her face, of dissatisfaction and fear. She hurts him, as she must. Adele finds some clarity when the blue-nail-polish girl kisses her. Her closest confidant is Valentin (Sandor Funtek), who takes her to a gay bar, where she catches Emma's eye. He also rescues her from a cruel inquisition by a gallery of her peers. In such moments, \"Blue is the Warmest Color\" finds great dramatic focus, and we feel intense heartbreak as Adele's crisis of sexual identity is made public.Kechiche veers wildly from the suggestive and evocative to the explicit, which isn't limited to bedroom entanglements. He eavesdrops on Adele's lit-class lectures, and contrives to offer profound angles on her situation \u2013 big-picture lessons on love, tragedy, sin. The film is best when he ties visual detail into the development of Adele's character. Emma, a budding artist, draws Adele, and the scratchy, indefinite lines of the sketch show a woman in the process of finding herself. Later, Adele poses nude for one of Emma's paintings, and the picture is fuller, bolder, but still enigmatic in identity.The film follows their relationship over several years. They move in together, and establish careers, Emma as an artist, Adele as a preschool teacher. Emma's parents introduce Adele to the joys of eating oysters. Adele prefers to keep her homosexuality hidden from her parents, and the couple concocts a ruse to keep them in the dark. Their story is episodic and indulgent, yet compelling. It moves quickly. Its most consistent element is Kechiche's fascination with Exarchopoulos' face, so subtly expressive, it's Art... in Motion.",

The film imposes itself as a raw slice of Adele's life.Do not get discouraged with the staggering three hour long runtime, Blue is the Warmest Colour is a pleasing reality-based, hard-hitting depiction of our young generation's internal thought process in dealing with love. Unflinching with unequivocal passion, Blue may be one of the most reminiscent film-to-reality love stories.French-Tunisian director Abdellatif Kechiche strategically floods the film with aesthetic close ups to allow audience members to make the connection between the uncomfortable reaction of gazes which he observes in the film (most specifically those towards Adele), to the conversation of gazes in gay, straight, beautiful and grotesque members of society. Blue is the Warmest Colour is a film with many colours, some of them darker, and some of them brighter than others.The film follows Adele; a beautifully luscious, confidently curvaceous, knocked-kneed high school student through her escapades from youth to confused adulthood. We first see our lead in high school, flipping the pages of La Vie de Marianne, an unfinished novel by Pierre de Marivaux, which explicitly acts as a parallel to Blue. Peer-pressured by her obnoxious and immature schoolmates into beginning a relationship with a senior, Adele gives in to her friends and to the conventional. Exploring areas of her emotions, sexuality and physical limitations, Adele is left unmoved with her experiences with the boy. With almost no time in-between, Adele is lured into the unknown homosexual world of female attraction by a confusing and undefined friend at school, which thrusts Adele into the underworld of gay bars and lesbian hang-outs. In search of the unknown stranger crossing the street who floods her dreams and sexual tendencies, Adele is hopeful in her path to discovery. When Adele slips into a small bar and runs into Emma, the blue-haired fine arts student who has been the longing affection of her eye, they enrich one-another with an intense series of stares and dialogue-free looks that speak anthologies. As the sun sets and dusk begins to fill the air, Blue thwarts us to a salivating, engrossing and infamous sex scene complete with trembling bodies, unedited oral sex and a whole lot of slapping and smacking. As contrary to popular beliefs, the film is not solely about sex, especially this scene in particular.If I am being completely honest, as I exited the theatre, the film did not impact me in the way that I thought it would. My fondness of the film did not really take hold until I began writing this review and, it wasn't until then, that I explored the ways in which the film spread its infectious charm into my heart. As a whole, the film is a mysterious art piece. Surrounded by controversy between the predatory directing style of the filmmaker to the treatment of the actresses, to the glorified girl-on-girl sex scenes, to the unconventional filming techniques (no hair and make-up artists were on set, ad-libbed dialogue, elongated shooting schedules etc), the film is a miraculous testament to the power of its simple yet enduring storytelling. Whether or not the controversy of the film is what lured you to it (or the promise of outer-world lesbian sex scenes), the film will surely put to rest those loud accusations and replace them with an imminent pursuit of deep buried, personal demons.Based on a graphic novel by Julie Maroh, the film is an emotionally authentic journey of a woman in search of a sexuality that will inevitably bring her happiness. All the while, the film makes deliberate jabs and quips on the quickly crumbling European economy and stark symbols of the French class system. Constantly graphic and emotionally exhausting, Emma and Adele begin a journey that is the foundation of their sexual expectations. But don't get caught up with the longevity of the sex scenes or the graphic nature of the two sprawling bodies on the beds, Adele's and Emma's positions in the bedroom are reminiscent of the emotions that they portray in the film, visually appealing yet logically illogical. As Adele and Emma constantly engage in elongated instances of cunnilingus, eventually, we as the audience becomes desensitized to the unfamiliar images on screen. Instead we begin to pay more attention to the passion and allure of these two women and are attracted more to the chemistry of Adele and Emma. This in turn allows us to examine our own relationship traits and experiences.One of the more unnerving pressures of writing this review, as a young and enriched film critic, to those professional reviews I am sure you will read on Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic, is the factor of how closely I am able to follow and relate to the situations and scenarios in which Emma and Adele find themselves in. Leering with instances of infinite tenderness and ravishing displays of sexual ecstasy, the film serves as a self-reflexive examination of the possibilities of my own relationships for the future and my experiences with partners in the past. Blue is the Warmest Colour is a current, fresh and unapologetic depiction of the young people's screwed up decision-making.Check out the rest of the review at www.nightfilmreviews.com",

            "content": "I saw this movie at the Chennai International Film Festival and what a film it was! I can't take Adele from my thoughts for the past 2 days. I see her faces everywhere. She carries the entire weight of this movie on her shoulders. I did not even imagine that 2 girls can love so passionately in real life. The expressions on Adele face whether sleeping or enjoying a meal or desires fulfilled in sex scenes. She is brilliant! No doubt that she lived the life of Adele. I think the film is great because the director focuses on Adele and her life. He is never out of focus (pun intended) from Adele. He captures her every mood in every frame. There are close-ups of her face in the big screen and camera revolves around her everywhere! I first felt it was kind of annoying to allow camera walk with her, dance with her but now I get it. The director doesn't want us to leave Adele, we must feel her and we feel her. No doubt about it! Its a love story! Go watch it and you will not regret it.",

            "content": "This is one of those movies you should never watch with your parents because it will be awkward and you don't want them to question you about it.The story to Blue is the warmest Color is about a young lesbian couple from inception all the way through to one possible end.Wow this took me a while to get around to watch this movie I mean originally I was going to watch this back in 2013 but at the time I was busy and after a while I forgot about the movie, until this year I finally watched it and wow let my just tell you that this movie is brilliant and I'm not just saying that because of the sex scenes, I really do think this is a real and honest look at young age sexuality.Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos and L\u00e9a Seydoux both give Oscar worthy performance in this movie that's how good they were. Now one of the actress Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos that I never seen before in anything until this and I got to say that she is a actress I would like to see in more roles showing off her talent. I have seen L\u00e9a Seydoux before in movies like Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol, Midnight in Paris, The Grand Budapest Hotel and Inglorious Bastards, and just like I said about Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos I would like to see L\u00e9a Seydoux in more movie and well she is going to be in Spectre so there's that.The director of the movie Abdellatif Kechiche directs this movie so incredibly well and so magnificent that he understood teenagers today how they really act. It wasn't like Hollywood movies that normally get it totally wrong and have no clue on what teenagers are like today because Hollywood are just a studio with their heads up their own ass and have no clue on reality, then comes this movie that's not from a big Hollywood studio but from a different country and a different director who actually have touch of reality on it's characters and how young people discovering their sexuality, and that's why Abdellatif Kechiche pretty much made this movie work.Now I hear a lot of people saying that this movie is basically porn with the two lesbian and them having...you know what I'm talking about. Now here's the thing porn is basically not real and what I mean is that the actors are getting paid to do they business and the whole meaning of porn is to watch these people who probably don't know each other or don't really like each that much but they have sex anyway and after the video is done they get paid and off they go. Blue is the Warmest Color dose have sex scenes that you would find on PornHub if I have to be honest but it's more than just, the movie brilliantly shows a relationship, a break up, how much they love each other or do they love each other. It's things like this that isn't rocket science to work out and some people are making false arguments over pointless things in movies, some people are so stupid sometimes.The writing was realistic and brilliant, the movie is 3 hours long and it flew by me just like that. Now for problems: I haven't got that much to say when it comes to problems but if I have to really think of the things that I didn't like is that there are some scenes that I felt didn't really belong there and felt a bit fill, and that's it for problems, you see how small my problem was.Blue is the Warmest Color may not be a easy watch for some people but it shows a realistic look on sexuality and young people today that I think is what makes this movie great from start till the very end.",

It took enough time as needed to really let her experiences be revealed to us so that we understood her best through them.Honesty as there was no compromise to the presentation. Adele especially was presented as blubbering, nervous and awkward, shy and bumbling, and ultimately, this made the character more human and beautiful.Respect for the characters, their conflicts, complexities, and intelligence, which shows the same for the audience.A very good film.",

            "content": "Romance movies, be they comedy or drama (or those awful Judd Apatow fusions), rarely show the full spectrum of tenderness and horror that love can do to a person (and when they do it's usually sugar-coated and 'Hollywood', such as most things adapted from the book by Nicholas Sparks). With love comes happiness and security but when it is suddenly taken away from you there is only hollowness and despair.Adele is a high school senior pressured into having sex with boys to appease her nasty \"friends\". She enjoys it, but still feels that it is wrong. A split-second encounter in the street with blue-haired artist Emma leads to love at first sight and Adele can't get her out of her mind, fantasizing about her in bed at night. Lesbian urges grow inside her and she finally builds the courage to find Emma and falls head-over-heels in love with her.Adele's sexuality (and, by extension, Emma's too) causes problems with her school friends, her family (a scene in which she was disowned was unwisely cut from the final movie), and Emma's own circle. Her jealousy eventually leads to critical trust issues. It's a sin that everybody is guilty of at some point.Abdellatif Kechiche fills the movie with very long, following takes which highlight the mundane existence of Adele as she longs for love. The sex scenes are passionate and believable, punctuated with moans and gasps rather than music and are shot in realistic light which is not too unflattering. None of the actresses wear make-up, allowing their full range of facial expressions to show their true emotions, including messy, greasy hair. The sex scenes are nothing to get offended about, they are tasteful and honest and only a prude would object. Anyone taking the film seriously will find it hard to not be emotionally affected by them. But they are not pornographic.However I did find the \"food mouth\" close-up shots at the beginning to be a major turn-off.Blue is the Warmest Color is most certainly a film that will linger in your mind for a long time and will resonate, or maybe open old wounds, of people who have loved and lost. It's a very hard watch and not really a movie you can enjoy, but I'd sooner have this over anything starring Jennifer Aniston or Goldie Hawn's daughter.",

            "content": "\"Blue is the Warmest Colour\" is a film of many faces. It's a story about the education of an uncomplicated young woman trying to find happiness as she moves from adolescence to adulthood. It's a story about two lives that are initially bound together by an irrepressible passion but eventually come apart as differing needs set in over time. And finally, it's a story about the vagaries of love, and the way that one person can irrevocably alter the course of your life even after they are no longer a part of it. It is an extraordinary film, unapologetically frank in its depiction of the titular character's sexual awakening and emotional growth over the course of several years, but still acutely affecting in the way that it fully immerses the viewer into the primal, dismantling experience of falling in love. Adele Exarchopoulos carries the entire weight of this story on her shoulders, and delivers one of the best performances of the year. To say that she is \"acting\" would be a disservice. She all but becomes Adele, and through the simplest expressions that flicker across her cherubic yet oddly sensuous face is able to communicate a wealth of emotion stirring underneath. Within the span of three hours, Exarchopoulos vibrantly fleshes out the the most formative years of this young woman's life, showing her transition from curious high-school student to semi-domesticated schoolteacher with remarkable, bracing ease. Lea Seydoux is almost equally as fantastic as the object of Adele's cataclysmic obsession. The actress does subtle wonders dramatizing Emma's own personal arc, and at delineating the negative space that expands between her and Adele as their respective vocational interests and lifestyle philosophies diverge. Director Abdellatif Kechiche is an observer above all else, and the drawback of this is that he probably lingers on some scenes for a bit too long. The intimacy with which he chronicles Adele as she meanders through all of her experiences--big, small, and everything in between--is ultimately what gives the film its distinctive verve, but some of the scenes felt extraneous and could have easily been trimmed. That being said, the director is more than a bit successful in achieving his primary goal: to chart the dizzying emotional trajectory of an all-consuming love, and the crushing aftermath of its demise. You leave the film having felt every inch of Adele's craving for what once was but will never be again, but amidst the uncompromising hurt also lies the hope of something more on the other side of the experience. Kechiche ends the film on a wonderfully ambiguous note, and in doing so remains faithful to the story's overarching message about the elusive, untidy, ineffable nature of a happiness that is linked to another person, and about the lessons that only a first love can teach us...especially after it's gone.",

            "content": "At the time of its release \"La vie d'Ad\u00e8le\" got a lot of publicity and attention, not in the least because of the explicit sex scenes.To be honest the publicity was not an incentive for me to see the film. Earlier I had seen \"Fucking Amal\" (1998, Lukas Moodysson) about a beginning lesbian relationship and that film is brilliant. Compared to \"Fucking Amal\" I thought that \"La vie d'Ad\u00e8le\" could only be a disappointment.Ultimately I did see the film, and with respect to the sex scenes I was right. Most of the film tells the story from the point of view of Ad\u00e8le (Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos), one of the two lovers. The sex scenes however are from the point of view of a third party, and this third party definitely has \"a male gaze\". On top of that the scenes are far too long and contribute little to the story.A couple of years after \"La vie d'Ad\u00e8le\" I saw \"Portrait de la jeune fille en feu\" (2019, C\u00e9line Sciamma). Of these three films about a lesbian relation the main characters are the youngest in \"Fucking Amal\" and the oldest in \"Portrait de la jeune fille en feu\". La vie d'Ad\u00e8le\" is in between with respect to age. As a film about a lesbian relation it is however the weakest of the three.The above is not intended to disregard \"La vie d' Ad\u00e8le\" altogether. The film has is its weaknesses as a film about a lesbian relationship, it has some strong scenes regarding relationships in general.To begin with the scenes in which the lovers introduce one another to their respective families and friends. In these scenes an element of class difference creeps into the movie, because Emma (Lea Seydoux), the other lover, is clearly of a better descent than Ad\u00e8le. So Ad\u00e8le has to face the challenge of eating oysters when she visits the parents of Emma for the first time (always a tense moment in an early relationship although seldom shown in a movie). When Emma visits the parens of Ad\u00e8le the open mindedness with which she is welcomed surprises, until it becomes clear that the parents take Emma for just a girl friend of their daughter and not her lover.When Emma introduces Ad\u00e8le to her friends, she seems to be very aware of the class difference. After the party she compliments Ad\u00e8le that she has done very well. Apperently she doubted in advance if Ad\u00e8le would be equal company for her friends. A rather derogatory fearAlso interesting is the break up scene. Emma accuses Ad\u00e8le that she (a) is ashamed of her and (b) is cheating on her.With respect to the accusation ad a there are clues that it is rather the other way round (she also above).Also the accusation ad b is quite unlikely. Emma is clearly the sexual more experienced one. It looks like Emma imposes stricter requirements on the monogamy of Ad\u00e8le than on her own monogamy, a habit I always thought characteristically of men.",

Unsure of her life, her emotions and her sexual identity does Ad\u00e8le begin to go look for that vision with blue hair. The ever present magnetism does its work and these two young women start a passionate and deeply intimate love affair which tests their own emotional depths and even reality itself.By all accounts, Abdel Kechiche's adaption of \"Le Bleu est Une Couleur Chaude\" is too long. It has a number of scenes, including the very explicit sex scenes, who manage to convey a level of intimacy that is one of the rarest things in cinema these days, but they loose some of their power because the camera lingers on for too long.This important critique aside, \"La vie d'Ad\u00e8le\" is an engrossing, breathtakingly acted love story that removes any kind of gender questions and presents the unfiltered beating heart of young love.It elevates those moments of pure joy and profound emotional understanding to a universal level, that makes this experience at times too much to bear. Not because of what is shown but how familiar all these emotions are to so many people on this planet.\"La vie d'Ad\u00e8le\" gives to the lucky few the assurance that if your life is sparred by the heart-break of your first truly idealistic love and you manage to take said love into the world of everyday relationship or marriage you have one of the rarest gifts in life. To the many, who had to concede their first true love to the higher forces that life presents, Kechiche and his two lead actresses provide a very touching mirror into those moments where reality tips to the side of momentary bliss only to pull the rug right out from under us.And as it is with the exquisite pain of a broken heart, you don't forget a movie like this.",

Some think it's great and some say it's awful, and I heard even stated that the actresses felt ashamed afterwards.The film is almost three hours long, but considering the length it was quite enjoyable and not as boring as it could have been. The dvd case states the film consists of two parts but to me it seemed like just one long movie, and the story basically has three sections like most dramas.I liked the first third best, when the characters are introduced and the main couple get to know each other. It has an innocent and uncertain feel of teen romance which has a warm feel.Then, in the middle part there is a lot of sex, and the way it's portrayed is a bit...vulgar, in lack of better word, considering it's a drama film. This is maybe the thing this movie is most known for? At first it seems exciting that there is something sexy, but the very graphic love-making goes on too long and it's also shot pretty much like a porno film which seems quite off. It's quite hot, yes, but it feels tasteless considering how tasteful the movie started. Well, it's a French film, so I guess this may explain something. That country has a long tradition of sensual and erotic imagery, and that aesthetic might sometimes be confusing for foreigners. But I just thought the actual story in the movie would work better without the sex scenes, or they should be more subtle in style.Then, towards the end there is more conflict with the characters, them trying to figure out what to do with their lives, and it's set in a time a couple of years later. I didn't really care about the ending that much. I felt like the story had a great start but it didn't ultimately go anywhere.If you want a romance drama that is also a sex film, then go for it. But overall I don't think this film deserves all the attention it gets. Skip it unless you are really curious.",

This has the effect of making you believe you are watching reality, rather than a tightly scripted film. However some scenes are so long that you shift in your seat and you again notice you are in a cinema. The realism is therefore lost. This particularly applies to the first sex scene which could have made its point in half the time. There are also gaps in the time-scale that are quite disorienting. The film skips on months and even years without any hint for a while that this has happened. I suppose it is like a memory. Some things are vivid and you can re-live them, while large chunks of life fly past un-memorably. Consequently things happen off-film of which you become aware later. It means that sometimes you miss some of Ad\u00e8le's motives and experiences and you have to guess, which may be the point. We saw Emma's relaxed parents but not Ad\u00e8le's clearly less relaxed parents. This aspect is covered in the original graphic novel. Perhaps with the gaps filled in, we could have been able to understand why she was so alone. Was her longing to deal with children driving Ad\u00e8le's relationship with men? We can only speculate. Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos certainly gives a superb performance and so you feel for her character throughout. This aspect alone makes it worth watching. All in all, it is a good, thought-provoking film, but not one to knock your socks off.",

The cast is pretty brilliant, especially the focus character played by Exarchopoulos, giving a truthful, dedicated performance to every scene, as the direction and writing blends together making a very believable whole. At about 3 hours long the run time is far too excessive for any love story (I've never seen so much pasta eating before), as ten minutes will pass every so often and very little, or indeed anything will really happen, but certain parts are truly gut- wrenchingly painful owing to the fact that the relationship from the very beginning is utterly credible, which is something not many movies ever really pull off, or even get close. For a select, patient audience this is worth 3 hours of time, but frankly it's pushing it, and I very much doubt I'll watch it again any time soon.

Basically shy fifteen year old teenager and high school student Ad\u00e8le (Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos) hears classmates gossipping about boys constantly, then one day while crossing the street she passes a blue haired woman and feels instant attraction, she does date and have sex with a boy from school, but feeling dissatisfied she breaks off the relationship. Ad\u00e8le has vivid fantasies about the woman she saw and one of her female friends flirting with her, she becomes troubled about her sexual identity, her openly gay friend Valentin (Sandor Funtek) understands her confusion, he takes her to a gay dance bar, she wanders into a lesbian bar and experiences many women approaching her. In the lesbian bar the blue haired woman appears and intervenes with other women asserting advances, the woman is graduating art student Emma (L\u00e9a Seydoux), they become good friends and spend a lot of time together, but Ad\u00e8le's friends ostracise her at school suspecting she is a lesbian, this brings her and Emma closer together, to the point when they share a kiss during a picnic. Ad\u00e8le and Emma later have sex and begin a passionate relationship, Emma opens up about the relationship to her artsy family and they are very welcoming to the couple, but Ad\u00e8le's father (Aur\u00e9lien Recoing) and mother (Catherine Sal\u00e9e) are conservative and working-class, she is not able to open up and tells that Emma is her philosophy class tutor. In the years that follow the couple and lovers start living with each other, Ad\u00e8le finishes her education and becomes a local elementary school teacher, Emma tries moving forward with a painting career, Ad\u00e8le feels ill at ease among Emma's intellectual friends, and Emma thinks Ad\u00e8le should leave teaching a become a writer. Ad\u00e8le enjoys playing the stereotypical feminine role in the relationship, but Emma becomes distant physically and emotionally, with their age difference perhaps being a main factor they gradually realise they do not have much in common, the relationship manifests emotional complexities, and feeling lonely and confused Ad\u00e8le sleeps with male colleague Samir (Salim Kechiouche), Emma finds out about Ad\u00e8le's brief fling, Ad\u00e8le begs for forgiveness, pleading that it was a mistake, but Emma and kicks her out of their apartment, Ad\u00e8le is left heartbroken and alone. Ad\u00e8le finds satisfaction working as a kindergarten teacher, but time has passed and she is overwhelmed with indescribable sadness, she and Emma do eventually meet up again in a restaurant, Ad\u00e8le is still deeply in love and there is an undoubtedly powerful connection between them, but Emma cannot allow herself to reignite a relationship, and she is already committed in a partnership with Lise (Mona Walravens), previously pregnant at a party, now with a young daughter, Emma and Lise has perhaps known each other for years and became reacquainted at the party. Ad\u00e8le is devastated, but holds it in, Emma admits not feeling sexually fulfilled, and reassures Ad\u00e8le that their relationship was special, and the film concludes with Ad\u00e8le attending Emma's new art exhibition, Emma does acknowledge her, but her attention is primarily on other gallery guests and Lise, Ad\u00e8le congratulates Emma on her success, and has a brief conversation with Samir, she leaves and he chases after her, Ad\u00e8le walks away into an ambiguous future. Also starring Benjamin Siksou as Antoine and Alma Jodorowsky as Beatrice. Exarchopoulos gives a good innocent performance as the sexually confused young woman, and Seydoux is good as the older young woman she falls for with blue hair, they make a believable difficult couple, the sexual scenes between them are fantastically explicit, and it is an easy to follow lesbian relationship story, full of emotional complications, it is definitely a film that deserves the attention it got, a most watchable romantic drama. It was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film not in the English Language, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film. Good!",

            "content": "An absolute masterpiece, one of the greatest films of this century.Film is one of the most raw and encompassing of art forms. It shows us the realities of our existence and at the same time allows us to dream of another life. Few films hold this delicate balance as credibly and as well as 'Blue Is The Warmest Colour'.Quite simply, the film is about an adolescent girl, Adele, and shows her journey as a school girl in a fairly conservative environment. She goes about her business with a minimum amount of fuss but we immediately sense that she is not whole in her life. She begins dating a fellow schoolmate (a boy!) who is nice to her and is a decent person, but she ends the relationship. She doesn't really know why. She thinks back to going to meet her ex-boyfriend on their first date and a chance encounter with a blue-haired girl (Emma) who immediately captures her imagination and Adele realises she hasn't got over this encounter. She meets Emma and they begin a relationship together.Now, I could go on mundanely retelling the rest of the story, but this would be doing the film a disservice. Films as poignant and powerful as this are about the finer details. The use of food as a symbol for class, the use of water and art throughout the film, the intense close-ups throughout the film and often the lack of soundtrack at key points make the film powerful and memorable. But above all it is the two leading performances that are both electric and haunting and are the main reason to watch this film.This also isn't just a great film about LGBTQ+ rights but also about all of us who feel detached in some way. Whether it is like in this film, serving 'Spag Bol' to intellectual 'snobs' to try to genuinely assimilate or having to lie to your parents that your partner is really your friend because you are afraid to fit in a certain circle, we all experience this dissociation that Adele goes through.I think this is a film that can be appreciated by everyone (as long as you are over 18 of course) as it's themes our universal and the performances are so realistic and watchable.",

            "content": "Faces in close-up, a chance meeting in a crowded square, eyes meet, hang on for a second, part again. Except from Ad\u00e8le's: she turns around, tries to make the moment linger, cannot move on. Before this, at the start of the film, we have watched Ad\u00e8le's class read from Marivaux's La Vie de Marianne, the passage about love at first sight, about being stricken with someone like never before. And so La Vie d'Ad\u00e8le begins. In Marivaux's novel, the love will not survive, defeated by differences in class. Something similar will happen here, but what happens along the way and how it happens, is one of film's greatest miracles in recent years.For three hours, director Abdellatif Kechiche follows Ad\u00e8le as she moves from teenager to young adult, as she meets, falls in love, lives with and is left by Emma, a blue-haired artist a few years older. La Vie d'Ad\u00e8le takes its time, the first scene in which students read from a book lasts for minutes, the lovers' first sex is seven minutes long. The film consists of episodes, laconically following each other, sometimes there are minutes between them, at others several years. There is an over ten minute spell in the middle \u2013 marking the blossoming of their love \u2013 in which not a word is spoken, several drawn out and very explicit sex scenes. As slow as its pace is, as long the periods in which nothing much happens, La Vie d'Ad\u00e8le is never boring, not for a moment, and it isn't a second too long.Instead, it develops its own rhythm, like a long, drawn out poem, it creates its own time in which years are seconds and seconds years. Scene follows scene, one after the other, point after point. There is no artificial flow creation \u2013 it happens naturally as we go along. Because, if this is a poem with a lyrical rhythm of its own, it is the poem of life and love, its pace that in which life happens \u2013 or doesn't. La Vie d'Ad\u00e8le is the story of a girl becoming a young woman, yet it is far from being a coming of age tale. Also, this is not about a young Lesbian, just a young woman trying to find herself. The film does not shun the subject of homosexuality and society's acceptance of it, but it is not a topical film. It is part of life and here, life writes the script.First and foremost, this is film of faces. Almost the entire film is done in close-ups. Occasionally it leaves the face, goes to hands, breasts, thighs, moves along with the protagonist's glance only to return. La Vie d'Ad\u00e8le comes as close as it gets \u2013 to its characters' bodies, to their innermost selves, to us. The explicit sex is just part of this deal, it holds back nothing and yet it leaves so much to the viewer. For nothing is spelt out, all is in those bodies and faces, mostly Ad\u00e8le's. Ad\u00e8le Exarchopulos plays this open-mouthed and wide-eyed average girl with all the openness and closeness of youth. Her face reveals and conceals at the same time. As she tries the conventional sex with boys lifestyle, gets confronted by her friends, gives in to love, clings to it and wanders aimlessly to a life missing its meaning, we watch her. Everything: the fear and love, the insecurity and confidence, the happiness and desperation happens right there. The same is true for L\u00e9a Seydoux who plays Emma, a more confident, outgoing but equally vulnerable counterpart.Everything is subtle. The falling in love just happens and so does its end. When it does there is no run-up to it, it comes right at the moment with a devastating force that hurts. Yet, life goes on while it doesn't. Ad\u00e8le's face becomes aimless, questioning, wondering. The growing conflicts are hinted at and all in the faces that drift apart, the looks that meet each other less and less, that grow asymmetrical \u2013 when one looks longingly, the other is occupied by something else. The girl who wants to be a teacher and the ambitious artist, one from a family whose signature dish is Spaghetti Bolognese, the other used to eating oysters, they fit and don't fit, they complement each other but remain worlds apart. Attraction and distance are again conveyed in ways of looking, in facial expressions, positions of bodies towards each other.La Vie d'Ad\u00e8le is a miracle. A long poem with a pace and rhythm and visual language all its own, a story written in and by faces and bodies and looks. It moves along effortlessly, in a matter of fact way that needs no dramatization, no elaborate editing, no music or track shots. As we watch its characters look at each other, themselves, life, it also just looks. and in that look, the look of life, of love maybe, is the story of a girl's search for herself, of finding and losing, of growing up without even trying. A search that might not be entirely successful and one that certainly doesn't end. The story of life. Nothing more.http://stagescreen.wordpress.com/",

            "content": "Three-hour movie, French film, plain plot, biographical AND coming-of-age genre. All the things I do not enjoy when watching movies, but this one was different.Okay, first, I cannot concentrate when the story seems elongated, meaning if there is no tension and continuity in the story, it's not worth watching. Biographical gerne especially adds humdrum because movies narrate in chronological order and in very linear course. 'Blue Is the Warmest Colour' also follows the life of Ad\u00e8le for three years in the order of time and lasts three hours, but time passes without even noticing it. I think it comes from Ad\u00e8le's acting. Because it is detailed, realistic, and subtle, it keeps audience focused for three hours till the ending even though the story lacks some energy and dynamics. I finally found actual crying scenes that an actor does not pretend to be prettier or sadder. Break-up scenes are ugly as it is in real life.Second, I like that 'Blue Is the Warmest Colour' does not try too hard to look pretty, artistic, or quirky. French cinema tends to overdo cinematography over actual storyline. Some French directors are obsessed with one way of camera work, one color theme, one CGI technique, or just any one thing. On the other hand, color theme in this film is very subtle in elegant way but gives out powerful message and ambiance. However, there are too many close-up scenes, making the movie look stuffed and narrow. Small weakness.",

            "content": "First of all, this is the film for open minded and honest viewers. It does not require \"educated\" or \"well informed\" viewers, but only honest to themselves. For this reason, there are a lot of middle class, small minded intellectual ( lesbian) critics who will attack this film for not being \"truthful\" to the\"real\" nature of woman to woman love, and being seen through a male gaze. However, this is actually a film about woman to woman love, and woman to woman attraction, sex, union, betrayal, break up, and closure. It is also a film about first real love, and first (and possibly only) real sexual connection with another person. The fact that the director is a man does not mean so much: two lead actresses performed that relationship on the screen with an attitude, apparently firmly believing in what they were doing, much more than big names in dozed and \"psychologically framed\", \"decent\" other lesbian themed movies. This is a story about emotions and psychological development of a young woman told in a way which is different than usual: she feels the things with her body, with her skin, with her lips, and thats how she learns stuff and makes mistakes. She is not well read and well educated and she does not have anyone to talk to, so she cannot rationalize what is happening to her. She takes the stuff as they are, and thats why everything looks somehow raw, illogical and stupidly done, because thats how the life is. The film does have certain slippages in the narrative. The Emma story part is a bit underdeveloped, and requires a bit of viewers' reading into the story. For instance, in the end, after the break up, it might seem that Emma is happy with the new partner; however, it is also suggested that actually its not about being happy: she just made her new life settled and bearable. She is able to function as a person and artist with a new partner, to have a family, while with Adele she was painfully aware that it cannot last, and that this intensity cannot be functional. Too much love and obsession can kill the love, so Emma lets it happen, rather than to sacrifice other stuff for love. She wants Adele to change, and become more socially accommodated for her, and when it does not happen, Emma lets their love fade, preoccupied with her career. One mistake, Adele's meaningless affair with a guy, was enough for Emma to take her revenge and end their love. This part is a bit unclear: was she really hurt that much, or was she already aware, even before that, how impossible their love was? It seems the latter is at stake. It also seems that she got over Adele, but that is just her high class training on how to handle something potentially painful. In the end, lets just say, dear lesbians, dont pretend that lesbian sex is not that lustful. It is, just it does not happen with that intensity with everyone. That line, between authentic sex and vanilla sex, is very well drawn in the last scene, when Emma admits that sex with her new(old) partner is \"different\" than with Adele. Love is a heavy thing, and when it really happens, it leaves a deep trace, not only in one's mind, but also on every part of one's body. Also, real love and attraction cannot survive in the life full of trivialities and other frustrations. Love without calculations never lasts. Unlike Adele, who has had it for the first time, Emma, who is older, knows it, and thats why she ends it without looking back, thats why she is a cruel one. This is the part which could have been more underlined in words and dialogues, but than the film would have been a bit intellectualized, and the director apparently wanted to avoid it. If you are open minded, don't miss this movie, because even your children will talk about it.",

            "review_title": "the dull bits, the oyster",
            "content": "This will probably be remembered as an extreme example of 'realistic' cinema (as opposed to stylized). The difference being that the former shows what \"it is\" and the later an abstraction of what it is. This is of course a fallacy, because cinema (and any form of storytelling) is an abstraction of reality. So there isn't for me realistic cinema, only different forms of presentation, different cinematic stances. Different abstractions. The abstraction here is to present a story to which you can or will relate (whether or not it mirrors bits of your own life) and than extend its context as much as possible, in time and context, to make you a part of the fabric, in the thing.So they take a story and make you relate to it as good as possible. Simple urges , a girl finding sexuality, social and personal relations at stake, prejudice and society are the antagonists. The first chapter is a recognizable coming of age drama. The second a normal drama. All the dynamics at work, social or private, have already been explored an infinite number of times in a number of films. I think the reason why they chose to make it that simple is to make audiences smoothly get into a familiar world and let the cinematic device kick in. And that's where the writers throw their aces. Hitchcock had a famous saying about how drama is life with the dull bits cut out. Here they invert the equation. You get to see it all. The argument and the whole crying after. The sex, with preliminaries and orgasm but also changing postures, caressing, the touching, the building up, the afterwards. Every sensation, every feeling, every change of mood is exhaustively shown, sometimes painfully, with every detail. Where many writers, upon re-reading the script, would cut and think about pace, rhythm and engagement; these guys let it be, extend it, let you soak in it. The drama IS the dull bits. The usual high points of a normal drama are here the mere validation of the interstices that you usually don't see. Nothing stays off-screen, nothing is suggested, everything that Ad\u00e8le lives is shown.The only normal cinematic trick, which is remarkably well pulled off, is right at the end: Adele goes and sees the exhibition of her former lover and sees the paintings of her new lover while pregnant, and with it learns that Emma was already detached while they both were together, that she was already moving away. Finding Adele's affair was for Emma not so much painful, as it was an excuse, a way out. Adele is at the end a broken soul. She never did write her own story, she only had the illusion of that. There is a self- referential hint to that: she declines writing, she admits she is unable to create story lines. She only wrote a diary, things gone by, not the fiction of her future.This works and has a certain power. I don't live my life in films eager to get things like this, i map my dreams to other kinds of abstraction, but this sure is worth exploring. The actress is strong, and the director understands that she's all about face, or he cast someone to fit his will to shoot in close-up. The relation between the camera and Adele's face is perfect for the first chapter. The stuff Bergman/Nykvist used to do. But i expected that in such a tight construction, so anchored on the character, the visual depiction of Adele would follow her evolution as a person. I would expect a different camera stance for the grown up Adele. Different hair style and different clothing doesn't quite do it.What also takes me completely out of the cinematic trance so competently built, is the new wave influenced crippled intellectualism to which so many directors seem to succumb... That preachy Sartre bits about how existence precedes essence. Kind of a touristic guide to the film, the text explaining the painting on an exhibition. Lame, pedantic and unworthy of the subtle construction that oversees the life of Ad\u00e8le. Godard should be blamed for this.This is the second film that i see in a week, which uses Oysters as tokens for sex. Food, film and sex can be a powerful mixture. The other film is Tampopo, which adds blood to the equation and its oyster is profoundly more erotic than any sex on this film.",

            "content": "There is much commonality in most love stories on film, with interest coming mainly from how they are told. I found the telling of this tale of two young women who fall in love to be engaging from several perspectives. First of all I was taken with Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos, the actress who plays Ad\u00e8le, the protagonist. If you do not respond to her physically or emotionally, then your experience of this movie is likely to be quite different from mine. L\u00e9a Seydoux, who plays Emma, Ad\u00e8le's love interest, was less appealing to me, but was well cast nonetheless.Ad\u00e8le's first encounter with Emma was an exchange of casual glances as they walked past each other. I liked that scene, since it was subtly done yet you knew from that first eye contact that these two were destined to be involved in some way. It may not have been love at first sight, but that usually just means sexual attraction at first sight and Ad\u00e8le and Emma had that.Director Kechiche had to have been fascinated with Exarchopoulos, given the many ways he filmed her to accentuate her appeal, it's like he couldn't get enough of her. He used her infectious smile to great advantage. A good part of the movie is taken up with closeups of Exarchopoulos and Seydoux. I liked the way that Ad\u00e8le did not anguish too much over her sexual identity, a theme that is prominent in a lot of gay themed movies. After some initial experimentation involving men and an attempted contact with a woman, once Emma was on board Ad\u00e8le knew that she wanted Emma and she never seemed to doubt herself in spite of getting flack from her mates.Early in their relationship Ad\u00e8le and Emma are seen engaging in explicitly sexual acts. These scenes have created a lot of buzz, but I think they are essential to the movie, since sexual attraction is what has brought these two women together and, as we get to know them, it is seen that the sexual attraction is going to have to be strong enough to bridge some cultural gaps. Emma comes from a family with liberal parents, a family that delights in eating oysters and drinking fine wine, while Ad\u00e8le's family is more into table wine and spaghetti with Bolognese sauce. Emma associates with artists, philosophers, actors, and other elites. Emma is so much more experienced and sophisticated than Ad\u00e8le that I did wonder how this relationship was going to work out, absent the sex. But it was Emma who broke it off, or was she just looking for an excuse to do so? To Ad\u00e8le's credit she recognized the cultural differences but, in spite of some small intimidation, she felt no need to pretend artistic inclinations. She likes children and, as the movie develops, we see that Ad\u00e8le does have a natural talent in the classroom in front of small children. There is a scene where Ad\u00e8le is involved in a group interaction with her class that has the kids so rapt that it reminded me of that fantastic scene in \"The 400 Blows\" that has the kids attending a Paris puppet show.The sex scenes are filmed with an appreciation of sculpture. In some scenes I could not quite figure how the women got themselves into the positions they were in. I had the feeling that maybe it was good that these women were lesbian, since finding a man who could satisfy them would be a challenge. It is not a stretch to see how this movie could be played as a love story between heterosexuals, but trying to see how it would work with gay men is more difficult to imagine. At the least male sex scenes would probably not make it past the censors. Apparently neither Exarchopoulos nor Seydoux is a lesbian, so the fact they could get themselves to do the sex scenes amazes me.This kept my attention for the full three hours.",

It is through our favorite colors that we manage to associate ourselves to other people and things around us. Bearing this fact in mind, it would only be in due course of time that viewers would learn whether the title of Abdellatif Kechiche's Plame D'Or winning film \"Blue Is the Warmest Color\" is a clever marketing gimmick or a cultural ploy. This is the first thought which might have come to many minds when viewers sought to watch \"La Vie D'Ad\u00e8le Chapitres 1 et 2\".There is no doubt that there would not be much curiosity for a film whose title speaks about two chapters in the life of an ordinary girl. Whatever one might say, it needs to be said that Abdellatif Kechiche has made an intellectual film whose dialogs consist of numerous references to the world of art (Egon Schiele,Gustav Klimt) and western philosophy (Existentialism and Jean Paul Sartre). Contrary to what one might say,'Blue is the warmest color' is not entirely a film about lesbianism as it focuses more on the world of teenagers in France where sexuality plays an important role. Although sex scenes are an integral part of this film, film director Kechiche succeeds in maintaining a neutral attitude towards all forms of sexuality including lesbianism. Even though he doesn't celebrate lesbianism in any form in his film, it appears that prudes do not share his vision as they continue to walk out of cinemas.This is hardly surprising for a film whose portrayal of parents is not something which would make any French student proud. Lastly, year 2013 ended on a good note for LGBT themed films with worldwide success of two films : Blue is the warmest color and L'Inconnu Du Lac.All genuine admirers of \"World Cinema\" should watch these two films.",

Her ever-changing environment constantly brutalizes her with social/chronological duties: first boyfriend, first heartbreaks, first important dinners, first professional projects, first passion, first colleagues, and so on.Thankfully, inside all of this torment, Kechiche confided in the narrative some ingenuous viewpoints to upraise the sensitivity of the stage of life : the actors were the master of the scene, right in the foreground. Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos is an excellent actress, her sincerity was more than touching, the emotion stayed and grew limpid throughout the movie. And well, I am not exaggerating when I say that I cried to EACH ONE of the facial expressions she made.Then there was L\u00e9a Seydoux, with her piercing blue and her vampirizing pallor. As she melted into her character, Emma melted into her, and the character just played as the backbone of the movie. She was Ad\u00e8le's greatest lover, her only companion until she found another muse's love+body to keep under her spell, under her paintress's hand.In each of her sequences, Emma led the story, through her paintings she expatiated Ad\u00e8le's life, from her teen age (now that's weird lol) to her debut in adulthood.In fact, she might have been the author-narrator of this coming-of-age story all along. Or at least it was what her role have opened up in prospects in the intrigue, like in those -very extended- sex scenes (that I often fast-forwarded tbh because they were too much, just intrusive and useless; some articles on the internet that explains the preeminence of sex in this movie -dealing with misconceptions on lesbian love- should be read for more understanding I think).Emma's narrative aspect also appeared in her paintings (like it was analyzed at Emma's second exposition). Her paintings, that had once captured Ad\u00e8le's \"youth\", in body and feelings, finally escapes Ad\u00e8le who couldn't find her place near her in any way anymore. With her blue hair, she just encapsulated time and was actually the one conveying Adele's feelings somehow. Like the arousal of lesbian feelings or the obsolescence of a strong amorous connection.In all, the scenario was superb and it perfectly matched the actors, more than efficiently. Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos and L\u00e9a Seydoux brought a profuse amount of vivacity and a lot of puissance to this beautiful, yet simple, initiation story. \"La vie d'Ad\u00e8le\" was 3 emotional hours that I didn't expect to be this poignant, and lasting after. Bravo!",

            "content": "This was a great movie , a proud gem of 2013.Its so real , you feel like you're there , hidden and silent , observing what unfolds. Both actresses did a great job , this was very demanding acting from the director , that the actresses delivered. The more the movie went on , the more sexy i thought of Adele.Someone said this movie is about desires , and i find that quite true. There are plenty of scenes of rawness of wanting and getting. We see them eating , especially Adele , munching with an open mouth spaghetti with salsa. At first it got on my nerves that the surrounding area of their mouths got that dirty from the food , and i said to myself \" this is forced , in reality we don't get that dirty when we eat pasta \" . But then i reconsidered , or maybe i give in , the second or third time i saw the munching and the dirtiness. Despite all this , the movie did get me hungry , for food and for sex.The direction is pretty seamless , to my ignorant eyes at least ,i see no fault in the pictures viewed. The thing is though , that i find myself clapping for the director's skill , not because of his good pictures , camera angles and such , but much more because of what he must have told to the actresses , the communication between them , and in general the cast , i think he managed in astonishing ways , to stretch the actor's abilities to their limits. Not that we see the actors struggling to reach that level , in contrast , the acting seems effortless , but you also realize that what you see is very hard , who are we kidding , there is explicit scenes of 7 minutes or 10 minutes , i was watching this movie by myself and got \"embarassed \" at times , imagine what the actors must have felt. I cant picture that , its insane. Plotwise , basically we see the 2 young women in their gay surroundings in a nice northern little French town. While the movie went on , i realized i was viewing something intense , something original , despite being good or bad , i think very objectively all people can give it the originality . But i found it also to be a good film. It sure is though a very specific kind of film , but any good film is like that . Ir lures you in its little world , there are no money issues in this film , no politics and no great social awareness messages in it. So it strikes me odd that it got no Oscar nominations considering this.",

            "content": "Much love to L\u00e9a Seydoux and Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos, for they are the driving force of this movie - not Abdellatif Kechiche's direction, not the screenplay he penned with Ghalia Lacroix, nor any other facet. Seydoux and Exarchopoulos slip so naturally into their characters that one could be forgiven for confusing actor and role; in every scene of dialogue, and of characters simply Being and going about their lives, there's an ease and fluidity to their performances that scarcely even feels like acting. This jives perfectly with the tone of the picture as a \"slice of life,\" or \"a day in the life,\" as the narrative traces the comings and goings of the characters and the growth of protagonist Ad\u00e8le, in particular, as a person. After all, in as much as 'Blue is the warmest colour' is a romance, it's also emphatically a coming of age story. With that slant, of course some scenes become decidedly awkward, uncomfortable, or kitschy; moreover, an ugliness rears its head with any suggestions of homophobia, even when so simple as when Ad\u00e8le or Emma is compelled or feels the need to hide their relationship or preferences. (Thankfully the latter aspect is the least of anything herein.) Even when those feelings are most evident, the true warm heart of the feature is in those moments when the stars are able to inhabit their parts and explore them freely with little more than a general vibe for the scene to inform their portrayals as the narrative progresses.It's to Kechiche's credit that 'Blue is the warmest colour' is mostly defined by such quiet, organic thoughtfulness and ultimately explosive character (relationship) drama. It's no wonder why this has achieved such broad acclaim, especially for Seydoux and Exarchopoulos - it's very much worth watching on its own merits, and it should be noted as well that three hours go by surprisingly quickly. (As a minor point of comparison, in my experience only Sion Sono's four-hour magnum opus 'Love exposure' has accomplished an even greater feat of pacing.) I will also say, however, that I think this distinctly falls short of perfect, and it does so in one specific way above all: the sex scenes between Seydoux and Exarchopoulos are astonishingly bad. I welcome, and demand, lesbian representation in cinema; by all means, that is the lion's share of what 'Blue is the warmest colour' offers. Sex scenes can be an important part of the narrative in a movie. Here, for all the electricity the leads bear between them in general, and the dynamics between the characters, their sex scenes are flat and dull, not to mention artless; I couldn't suppress mocking laughter of disbelief, least of all during the first, longest, and most explicit such instance. I think Kechiche is to blame for this in his direction more than Seydoux and Exarchopoulos in their partnership, for there's also no getting around some tasteless and unnecessary examples of the male gaze elsewhere in the runtime. But there it is all the same. I'm at least grateful that sex is accentuated in the film only for a discrete portion of the length.I hardly intend to minimize the contributions of everyone else involved; in so many other ways this is wonderfully well made. The rest of the cast perform admirably, and the picture is well made from a technical standpoint. And I must concretely reiterate that I love the screenplay: Kechiche and Lacroix give us living, breathing characters of real depth and complexity, dialogue as lovely as it can be harsh, and scene and narrative writing that's tremendously absorbing and compelling. In examining Ad\u00e8le's development as a person generally, and her relationship with Emma specifically, 'Blue is the warmest colour' is brilliant, rich, and marvelously rewarding. When all is said and done, I quite agree with all the praise, and there's no doubt in my mind that this was fully deserving of all its accolades. I would only wish that the sex scenes were reduced even further as they present, not because they have no place in the feature, but because the ones we get here are done so poorly as to detract from the viewing experience at large. Still, the strengths far outweigh the weaknesses, and though I repeat myself it's Seydoux and Exarchopoulos who carry the day more than anything else. Noting the obvious content warnings, otherwise this is so fabulously strong and satisfying that I'd be remiss not to make a blanket recommendation - for as famous as it already is, 'Blue is the warmest colour' should have still wider recognition and be seen by more people. However it is one must go about watching, it's well worth carving three hours out of your day to see: shy of perfect, but darned near close enough.",

That is confirmation to me of stellar performances by the actors and director.I believe that Adele's journey into womanhood and her conflict over her sexual identity was \"spot on\". The movie was beautifully filmed and while some of the sex(love) scenes were intense, they purposely reinforced the special bond Adele had with Emma and how even the strongest bond is only as strong as the weakest link.

            "content": "Abdellatif Kechiche adapts from a graphic novel, telling of the passionate first love affair of young teenage student Ad\u00e8le for another woman. While this film has generated much interest for being a lesbian drama with some extremely frank and sustained sex scenes, it is rather, a supremely universal tale of that intense, uncontrollable first true love that will be achingly familiar to many.When critics talk about a \"brave\" performance in relation to a female role, what they usually really mean is that the actress spends a lot of time naked. Yet, in a film featuring some of the most honest sex scenes in mainstream cinema (by which I mean, sweaty, grindy, lengthy, noisy sex that doesn't come with an orchestral soundtrack and a degree in Eisenstein montage theory), relative newcomer Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos really delivers on the meaning of the word. For almost the entire (substantial) running time, Ad\u00e8le has the camera thrust about three inches from her face, searching her for every slightest flinch, every furtive glance, every strained muscle, as the young actress has to conjure a lifetime of an emotional journey. It's a stunning and utterly compelling performance that forms the true narrative heart of the movie, and that powers forward this otherwise occasionally meandering tale.What I can't let pass without comment though is the absolutely gratuitous, endless and utterly explicit scenes of... smoking. Whether eating, drinking, laughing, crying, fighting, shagging, or reclining on a chaise longue whilst being sketched by Jack, sorry, Emma; Ad\u00e8le is seemingly never without a fag hanging out of the corner of her mouth. I enjoyed this movie in the company of two good friends who also happen to be a lesbian couple. When the credits began to roll I glanced over to find, not that they were making all gooey-eyed at each other, but that they were both frantically constructing roll-ups for the dash outside to light up.

More seriously, the film really practices \"show not tell\", allowing us to get a real feel for its characters' lives and the subtlety of the dynamic of their interaction. Oddly, this is not (to me) a \"gay\" movie, in that it's a film about two people who find each other attractive, and to inexperienced Adele, it's a very particular wonder, which I liked - not everyone feels that \"gay\" or \"straight\" is a category by which they care to be identified, that you necessarily have something in common with those whose sexual orientation you share. Likewise, the relationship ends for very particular reasons, due to differences in need and social class (in this case, between the middle middle class and a certain affluent pseudo-Bohemia). Finally, the sex scenes are beautifully lit and acted.But - it is a lengthy drama. The repeated scenes where we see Adele teaching tell us about the passage of time, and her current state of ambition and mind - but sometimes the viewer is left wondering if the director couldn't have found a trick, to convey this information in a more compact way. The sex scenes aren't just porn - they offer great insight into the characters - but again they're very long. And perhaps my sympathy for this indulgence of the protagonists was lessened by the fact that they seem to both have plenty of advantages - in good looks, in family background, in a talent for what they do. We see how Adele is shattered by the break-up; but it's hard to believe she won't get over it. Ultimately, however, these are quibbles compared with what the film does well.

Her acting, the interesting methodically developed transformation of her sexual identity, her ignition of passion towards the feminine of her choice, the love affair and the eventualities of how the love affair plays out. Reality created true to life nuanced passionate love story. True lived in character became profoundly interesting as the youthful passion became inflamed. Creation of passion was well done by the actresses and director capturing the subtleties and slowness of the developing love, the pause during the eye contract. Her awakening into a sexuality orientation and leap into her identity took dramatic alteration from who she thought she was and it seemed at the end of the movie her transformation is still somewhat being discovered. Sequels can fully explore her sexual identity whether lesbian or perhaps someone who loves the person despite their sex. Sexuality was utilized to explain and showcase the passions she felt and contrast them to her other love affairs especially the one with the male. Not everything in film needs to be imagined sometimes stark portrayals can truly take the audience into whats going on. We get to be completely immersed into the passions seeing some of the sexuality between the characters. We can therefore not only understand but feel more the character's spiritual love, her painful anguish, her desirous passions since we were allowed to voyeuristically step into the bedroom and take a peak. The relationship was unpredictable and you did not know what would happen next. The movie could have exploited this sexuality giving more of a thrill yet it remained controlled by holding back and focusing on the relationship and the psychoanalysis of love. This created more interesting characters.A world that delights in the delectable sensuality of life. Not only regarding sex but food takes on a symbol of pleasure. You see side characters not so much indulging as taking real genuine sensual satisfying pleasure in eating. The exquisite, philosophical, thought provoking, literary referenced, writing coupled with unbelievably believable acting portrayals made this possibly the best made film this year. Philosophical conversations not related to the thrust of the story but its themes such as the comparison of male vs female pleasure, gave the film another level of substance. It was very long at 3 hours and you were left with wanting to literally follow the main protagonist and find out what would happen next in her life. A sequel was suggested at end credits and it would be wonderful to see more well made explorations of these subject matters following this amazing actress.

Kechiche and co-scenarist Ghalia Lacroix have developed absorbing characters (the film is based on a graphic novel by Julie Maroh) but it's their interpretation by leads Exarchopoulos and Lea Seydoux that gives the film its unique appeal. Exarchopoulos, in particular, is fascinating: her character seeks fulfillment, yet consistently seems restless and unsure, especially as she begins to realize that her idea of happiness--domestication--doesn't appear to be acceptable to the lesbian community she has entered through her relationship with Seydoux. Much has been made of the explicit sex scenes between Exarchopoulos and Seydoux (and for those interested in that sort of thing, they are doozies--Catherine Breillat, take note) but they serve as the crux of the film: the passion and commitment the leads bring to their love is consummating and convincing. It would have been nice if Kechiche had explored some of the political subtexts more fully (with a three-hour run time, there seems to have been ample time to elaborate on Exarchopoulos' expulsion from her high school social circle, yet the end result is discarded from the final product) but it's ultimately a film about a life and, in its simplicity, a satisfyingly effective one.",

I suspect a similar \"ordeal\" was endured by Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman in filming \"Eyes Wide Shut\".The film is about the relationship between two women, Adele and Emma. It is a first love for Adele and a passionate relationship for both. Those who have experienced such passion in a relationship can relate to their desire for each other. The story takes the two through the beginning, middle and end of the relationship with a realism that is compelling.However, I found the middle section to be slow. Also, though I thought the director's depiction of the relationship was honest, I wondered if that was enough to maintain the story for three hours. I cannot say the director communicated a point of view; it felt more documentary-like.I also did not particularly like the jarring transitions between sections of the story.

Then these girls break up and Emma's hair colour changes into golden brown. I think the producers should've kept the blue hair on Lea Seydoux throughout the film because it would really stuck to the name better. Not that I haven't anything against this and the actress but it just would look right having the character Emma just keep the colour in the film. I think its really disappointing that it didn't appeal to me. Anyways on the positive now, the acting was really well done including the music :)",

What takes the BLUE IS THE WARMEST COLOR people twice as long to say as it took the CARRIE crowd is that 1)high school is a tough place, and 2)some people won't find happiness (even if they have special skills such as telekinesis or wizardry at being G.I.B.). I went to this flick mostly to see if the Oklahoma State Police would arrest the managers of any Sooner theater showing it (as was the case a few years back, when they busted video store clerks on child pornography charges for renting the German import, THE TIN DRUM; no wonder Blockbuster went belly up in such a country, with so many U.S. sex police on the prowl!). To conclude, I'm certain BLUE IS THE WARMEST COLOR will NEVER grace a movie screen in Oklahoma.",

And even though it wasn't as I thought it would be, it still manage to kept my attention throughout and to get involve in Ad\u00e8le's life. The acting was excellent, it had many ups and downs and a lot of emotion. I can only imagine how hard and dark it had to be for the actresses. Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos was just perfect in the role of Ad\u00e8le, and just how she managed to play her and be her in every possible way. It's one of those performances that feel so natural and raw. While L\u00e9a Seydoux, who was more intriguing and daring was excellent too, mostly in the break-up scene were you can see all that rawness and mixture of emotions on her. The direction was also very good, and also very natural. Because the acting and the characters are the ones that make you not look away and just concentrate on them all the time. And even though most of the scenes were longer than they would necessarily be, most of the time they felt very natural and necessary because of the type of story it was telling. Because you want to get involve with these characters in every possible way, and spend every second of their life learning their experiences and tragedies. It's one of the most heart-warming and breaking movies I've seen this year, but also one of the best ones and possibly one that will become a favorite of mine. I wouldn't mind watching it again, and get lost in the characters once more. And although it had some very intense love scenes, they were just an expression of the true love and rawness the characters were expressing. Overall, excellent movie about love and life in the most passionate and natural ways.",

            "content": "This film is breathtaking and sticks in your mind for days. Its is 3 hours long, but there is not a dull moment. The film is in french and the English is subtitled. I am not usually keen on this type of film, but a found after only a small bit of time you forget it is subtitled and become more engrossed in the film, due to the fact that you have to read the subtitles, a swell as listen and watch.  It is a lesbian love story and highlights problems that teenagers might experience whilst growing up and learning about who you are. Adele is the main character, and dates men and finds that there is something missing,and being with men doesn't please her sexually. She then kisses one of her female friends, but is then rejected. She meets Emma and feels something she has never experienced before. She is then rejected by her friends because of her sexuality, and is devastated by this, but the film shows Adele growing up and eventually comes to terms with who she is. The acting throughout the film is amazing. I had never seen a film with the two main actresses in because they are french. Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos and L\u00e9a Seydoux acting is superb all the way though. They make the story so believable and real. They have great chemistry in the film, and due to the fact that I was so impressed with the film, I have watch them both being interview about blue is the warmest color, and it is evident that they have a lot of chemistry off screen also. The sex scenes in the film are a bit hard to watch considering they are slightly over the top, but overall they are amazing. They are so real and the actresses preform them so well. When I first watched the sex scenes I thought that they were having sex for real due to the fact that the actresses were completely naked, and you could see everything, but obviously wasn't the case and the actresses private areas were artificial. The end of the film was a bit sad, but I suppose it was realistic. It highlights what could happen in real life, and that Love stories do not always have an a happy ending.Overall brilliant film, with the best acting I have ever seen.",

Kechiche (whose previous films had left me indifferent) has made an over-long picture that might easily have been a 30-minute TV story. The lack of substance means that the spectator is left treading water through all the scenes of Ad\u00e8le's school life, lasting about an hour, followed by the scenes with Emma which also run on terribly. Kechiche has never learned the value of concise story-telling; he could have learned much from studying Truffaut's Antoine Doinel films.I found that Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos plays the heroine very well; she's got to be young, passionate, stubborn, secretive and many other things too and manages to bring it off. L\u00e9a Seydoux has an engaging grin which she relies on too much. The script doesn't develop her character much; we don't learn anything important about her development as a painter. Both actresses excel in a slam-bang fight scene about two hours into the story. I wish there had been much more emotional intensity throughout.",

            "content": "Passion and obligation collided behind and in front of the camera of Blue is the Warmest Colour (La vie d'Adele), a riveting coming of age story that should have universal applicability. After the director Abdellatif Kechiche was awarded the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, it was exposed that the film's crew were unhappy with the terrible conditions they had to work under. A film shoot that was meant to take only two months of filming was stretched out to five. Both of the film's female stars Lea Seydoux and Adele Exarchopoulos, who play a young lesbian couple, have vowed never to work with the director again after he made them perform up to one hundred takes of the same scene.Filmmaking can be an extremely deceptive business when it manages to mask these onset feuds from the public. It's remarkable that the film is as compelling as it is for the first two of its three hours in spite of the disruptions and the anger. It is testament to how believable both actresses are but also the realism of the situations they are placed in and how a relatively simple story became layered with philosophy relating to personal existence. Knowing the troubled relationship between the director and the actresses inflicts further irony because the film itself asks when commitment and genuine feelings of love and instinct are countered by social expectations. The source of the film is the French graphic novel \"Le Bleu est une couleur chaude\" by Julie Maroh, a simply illustrated story of a high school student who for the first time enters a gay relationship with an older girl. In the film, Adele is played by Exarchopoulos, who is shy and quiet and uncertain about her sexual feelings. She dates a guy but feels nothing for him. One of her female friends is also forward but unreliable. Through chance she meets Emma (Seydoux), who is older and a lesbian. Despite resistance from her own friends, Adele continues to see her. Adele's parents are also conservative. They don't believe art is a real profession and the girls' relationship is kept secret from them. Emma's parents are more liberal and have accepted their daughter's orientation. The relationship is tracked over a number of years, forwarding to when Adele is a school teacher and when Emma is working as a painter and an artist. The beauty of the story is just how uncluttered the early parts of Adele's life are told. There's an ease to the way the early scenes unfold that enhances the realism and authenticity of the scenes and their emotions. In the graphic novel the story is told through a diary framing structure, which has wisely been dropped. Some of the same situations and dialogue are lifted directly from the comic and to retain the simplicity of the source material, Kechiche plants the camera predominantly on Exarchopoulos' face. In the same way that the panels of the comic are deliberately sad and grey, her performance is remarkable in how she encapsulates and expresses feelings of loneliness and uncertainty. Her desire for a sense of belonging, as shown through intercuts of social rallies, makes her both innocent and sometimes tragic. She's a gentler contrast to Seydoux, who nails the grittier, life hardened aesthetic and mannerisms of her character. Realising the leanness of the graphic novel's story, the director and his co-writer Ghalia Lacroix, infuse philosophical ideas and culture references seamlessly into the script so that it has it the exterior of an intimate story but with much grander ideas. The classroom scenes, where texts like \"La Vie de Marianne\" are being read, very effectively foreshadow the film with ideas relating to destiny and fate and the way that actions define our existence. The film's coda is that people are drawn together through chance but their passion dissolves when faced by compulsive social realities. In their adult lives, Adele becomes a teacher because it's what she's always wanted to do, while Emma sells paintings of Adele in a gallery because it's her living, as opposed to when she instinctively drew her partner. The storytelling only falters when undercutting its own simplicity. Though they were included in the source material and provide a turning point in the relationship, the graphic sex scenes are one example of a needlessly long and extremely confronting sequence that could be have been drastically abbreviated. The adult years of Adele's life, which aren't in the novel, show subtle changes in her behaviour and growing self-confidence but these scenes also don't have the same tangible reality of the early sequences. There are some huge verbal fireworks but some plot points fall into domestic clich\u00e9 or are miswritten like a belated and awkward cafe scene.Though the film is flawed in that final hour and some will argue perverse with its lingering camera, there is still a reality to this film that people of any orientation or gender should find relatable and sympathetic. It is a film about self-discovery and it articulates very clearly that coming of age is inseparable from painful experiences that are perpetually tragic but also learning curves that define us. Both actions and mistakes build character for both the student and master. Similarly, Exarchopoulos and Seydoux will never work with Kechiche again but like Adele they've all be drawn closer to knowing the difficulties of intertwining passion and obligation.",

I didn't like it that much at first, but loved it more and more as it progressed and was aware, by its end, that I was watching something quite exceptional.The film as single-watch experience was magnificent. I adored Adele - feminine yet very confused about her sexuality, and Emma, who played an outright, resolute lesbian in looks and in action. Funnily enough, Emma the person who I most despised from the viewpoint of a heterosexual male, was in fact the person which I most admired by the end - a true, confident/competent, faithful person, whereas Adele was a confused and utterly lost mess. She still made the film her own however due to her vulnerability, beauty and emotions expressed on film. I felt strongly passionate about her.There's the controversial aspect to the sex scenes - raved about in post-release criticisms as being far too strong and far too frequent, and admittedly, they did have an influence in my reasons for watching the film. But in reality, forget about preconceived ideas of mild pornographic art-noire, which is what I had it labelled as, because it's much more than that. These girls really did have to f**k get those sort of performances in, it was that realistic. There is explicit nudity in some scenes - even a glimpse of an erect penis in one - but this is not the core, heart or soul of the film.It's a really good film with superbly emotional acting, just tarnished by negative public opinion on nudity, sex and lesbianism, begging the question, why does controversial material always bring down the rating on such great films?Three hours viewing time was very long, but not nearly sufficient. And do I care about French subtitles, not understanding the actual words? Does it impact on the quality of the acting performances? Not at all. I loved it.",

I initially assumed it would just be another \"lesbian\" film, but at the end of the film I was simply flabbergasted by the performances of the cast...especially Adele. The movie contains some of the most realistic, subtle, honest and mind blowing performances I've seen in ages.The movie showcases the journey of a young, teenaged girl Adele trying to determine her sexual identity. Adele is confused, dates men but realizes she is faking it, is kissed by a girl from her class but is later rejected by her saying it happened in the spur of the moment, dates another woman and passionately loves her, but after feeling ignored by her gets confused and dates a man but still loves her woman, then breaks up, is lost, is alone, she cries, she discovers life, she copes up with life.Every moment in the film is pure, honest, subtle and sincerely engrossing. There are many fantastic scenes which simply draws you into Adele's life, like the one where she walks by Emma for the first time on the street, the scene where she goes to the gay club and Emma \"rescues her\", when she kisses Emma for the first time, when she is crying alone, the breaking up scene, the restaurant scene where she meets Emma after a few years. But there is one scene which simply blew me away. When Adele is confused about her sexual identity, a girl from her class gets intimate with her. Thats when Adele realizes that she likes women more than men. But when Adele tries to get to kiss her the next day, she is rejected. The frustration that Adele went through at this moment and her expressiveness was one of the best I've seen.Emma was equally good, but Adele steals the show. The scenes where Emma just stares and admires Adele are fabulous. I have to say that the sex scenes are brutally honest and raw, and pulls you deeper into the film. It was definitely needed for a film like this.The restaurant scene at the end simply puts Oscar winners in Hollywood to shame. I've always considered European actors to be brutally raw, perfect, sincere and much better actors than their counterparts from other countries. But I must admit, Adele's is the best I've seen in ages. You think of an emotion known to man, and you will see in Adele's face at some point nor the other in the film.People who think same sex relationship based films are only a sexual showcase will have a different opinion after seeing this film. As a human being, I felt it was my duty to write this review. Even if one person on this planet sees this movie after reading my comment, I will consider my duty accomplished.And oh, the movie is 3 hours long...but at the end of the movie, you will feel that only 30 minutes have passed by.This movies goes into my hard disk.

            "content": "\"La vie d'Adele\" or \"Blue is the warmest Color\" it's an adorable film. It follows the life of that girl named Adele through a part of her life, and what happens to her since her school days. It's a very interesting film. It shows how the protagonist, in this case, Adele, it shows how she changes and start to affirm herself and her values. It's so beautiful, because following a character's metamorphosis is something that I most consider in any literally work, not matters if it's a film's script or a book. I always seek to be as connected with the character, normally the protagonist, as possible. And this film offers that. In these almost 180 minutes running time you know absolutely everything about her, and the aforementioned 'beautiful' part of all of this is that you live with her that transformation. You know why she starts to behave in a certain way, and sure understand her, even if she does terrible and dull things, you understand her, and knows the motivations of these 'errors'.What I also liked in the film was the symbolism, I mean, the blue color obviously, has a meaning, but the food as well, the jobs of the characters, all of that has a particular meaning. It may look like simple things, but I really do appreciate films which explore not only the story, but also the picture element, after all, cinema started in that way.Anyways, I loved that film. I like the way how it's different. You mostly don't see in films a so well-worked character development like the one presented in this film. We have films with good characters, in fact, some films nowadays have the capacities of doing a good development, but in that film, it's just something out of this world. The acting sure works very well, though I didn't consider Adele Exarchopolous (Ad\u00e8le) to be that great, I mean, she sure had good moments, and she incorporates the character, and for someone of her age, she really sets a high standard, and she made very difficult scenes look easy and etc. but Lea Seidoux(Emma) in my opinion, was better. Emotion wise, I mean, she had more facilities to show her character's emotions, not counting the fact that she as well disappears in the role (if that makes any sense). But both were great, for sure. I don't know so many actresses that would put that effort in a film.The film is entirely about Ad\u00e8le's life, and it looked like the director wanted to put some kind of documentary approach in the film. The scenes were mostly made with a digital and portable camera, a technique used mostly in films that want to make a more intimate, and a documentary- like approach. It worked well, despite me being not the 'biggest' fan of that resource, in that film I admit; was good and also very well made. The editing also was pretty good, there are lots of cuts in almost every scene of the film, but after 10 minutes in the film you really don't bother, because it's done in a way that really don't draws much attention, believe it or not. Very well done work in the editing. I have problems though, with the overly graphic sex-scenes. I mean, I do believe they were necessary, okay, but they needed to be like that? There are moments in this film that you mostly find in porn films. In that aspect, I do admit that I was shocked. That film may not be for everyone, but if you don't bother with that erotic scene, you certainly will experience a great film, one of my favorites this year. 9.7/10",

I loved the close up shots done at the strangest times of the day, it made her so realistic.The plot was amazingly well done, though I did not like one time jump they did. I expected a coming out to her parents but that was nowhere to be found. Quite a few social topics where touched so not adding a coming out really was a plot hole for me. The time jumps itself where a bit unexpected at first but added to the plot.There where quite a few sex scenes and normally they don't add a lot to the plot but in this film I think it was one of the key points to show the passion that Adele and Emma had for each other.I hardly noticed the score (I'm actually not sure if it was there at all) but most dance scenes where really well done.So much detail went into the ending of the film which I thought was a great touch.I think I was 16 the last time I fell in love with an actress on-screen, but the stellar performance and amazing beauty of Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos was just to much to handle! Not to mention that there where no make-up artists or stylists on set and most of the scenes where shot without makeup.This film was 3 hours long but it only felt like 30 minutes had passed after it was done, the only rating I can give it is a 9/10.",

Blue is the Warmest Color doesn't match Laurent Cantent's near-perfect film, but it's still a worthy winner. The central performances (particularly Adele Exarchopoulos as Adele) are outstanding - hence the decision to share the prize between the writer-director Abdellatif Kechiche and his lead actors. It's the emotional nakedness that stays with you. The highest praise I can give is that there are moments when it seems that the actors aren't aware there's a camera running. Sometimes the drama unfolding on screen is so raw it feels like one is prying. I think Steven Spielberg and his jury selected this movie for the top prize because of its brutal, loving honesty.The plot is simple: A coming-of-age story about a college student falling in love for the first time. Gravitating around this relationship are numerous complex themes of class, family, peer pressure and prejudice. These themes come and go throughout the generous three-hour running time, but the one that remains constant is the sense of Adele's isolation. She begins isolated by her indifference to stock heterosexuality; she is given brief respite in the intense relationship with Emma (Lea Seydoux); but then she is alienated by a hip artistic elite, her love story lost amidst a \"luvvie\" story. Heartbreakingly, Adele's growing ambivalence \u2013 drawn back and forth between selflessness and introspection \u2013 makes her doubt her own vocation, dare I say her passion, as a teacher of infants.A \"controversy\" (that is, a self-perpetuated media phenomenon) refers to the scenes of graphic sex, but it's the scenes of graphic emotion that are most affecting. The intensity of the physical relationship is deliberately juxtaposed against the drifting lack of connectedness that shadows the rest of Adele's existence. We see all of Adele yet we never really know her, and perhaps this is the point. Perhaps, in all those close-ups of her exquisite face, we never really get to know the mind behind it. But over time we do learn the depth of her feeling, and we receive the definite sense that she will never feel this wonderful, terrible feeling again.",

            "content": "We are told in Blue is the Warmest Color that tragedy is necessity of life. A profusion of blue symbolism is fittingly used in Blue is the Warmest Color. Blue, a color usually used to signify sadness and sorrow, represents the relationship between Adele and Emma, something Adele mistakes for something wonderful and comfortable. The symbolism gets twisted and the relationship that used to be Adele's life is now her life's demon, blue is now the tragedy of her life.Blue is the Warmest Color is an unexpected delights of the year, even if it is not profound, it thoroughly explores the emotional dynamics of a relationship. The direction is strangely focused for a three hour film, meaning Abdellatif Kechiche knows what important in the thick script and zeros in on it as he tells the story. Kechiche says \"Bring on the pornographic love scenes!\" Thankfully the explicit nudity and sexual content is there for a reason. As long as it advances character development, which it fully does, there should be no complaints about it.Adele Exarchopoulos is the newfound \"gem\" of the year and delivers a powerful, emotionally constant and fueled piece of acting that deserves to be in the company of Cate Blanchett's Blue Jasmine in the Lead Actress Oscar line-up. Lea Seydoux begins timid and unimpressive, then slowly evolves to charming, then explodes with acting chops you are not prepared for. The scene that ends Act Two and the centerpiece scene of Act Three are held up by the sturdy, uncompromising stance by the two actresses reveling in each other's talent.Though the film deals some hate for homosexuality, it stays away from being \"one of those films.\" With jump cuts and light-bouncing cinematography, Blue is the Warmest Color becomes a delicate flower of a film. Its worst flaw is that at times the plot becomes redundant, but even at that, three hours never feels like three hours especially when in the company of Adele Exarchopulos' acting.Grade: ARating: 8.5",

A story of an intense lover affair between a 20-something woman and a high school girl (the emphasis isn't on the age difference) and the unraveling of same is riveting and compelling. The acting by the two leads, especially Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos, is Oscar-worthy. The break-up scene alone, during which Exarchopoulos breaks down into a crying, blubbering, panic-stricken mess is amazing.Just a great film all around. The direction, the cinematography, the acting, the storyline, everything is near perfection.I've been visiting IMDb for about 20 years, and this is the first time I was so moved by a movie that I felt compelled to write a review.

            "content": "Homosexuality in movies was never new, it had been tried and tested. From Salo to Brokeback Mountain, filmmakers had always tried to bring it to light. Lesbian themes, as well, had been handled before in movies and had edged closed to being both subtle and over the top. Even though I have watched my fair share, I was never a huge fan of Foreign language films. Blue is The Warmest Color had been raking up good reviews and I was obviously intrigued to check what the big fuss was about. As I said lesbian romance or sex ain't anything new in movies and so was the story, which from the synopsis didn't seem like it was breaking any new grounds. The controversies made it more interesting, getting it a large audience and myself being one among them.Blue is The Warmest Color introduces us to Ad\u00e8le, a high school student who, just like any other 15 year old, goes to school, is quite well in her studies, hangs out with friends and like any curious adolescent, wants to have a satiable sexual life. Things start to go awry when she does try it out with guys and realizes that she is clearly confused about her sexual orientation\u0085until she lays upon this blue haired girl, Emma. Under the layer of Ad\u00e8le's issues lies a spellbinding story which expands onto being a powerful drama about relationships, sex, breakups and all things love.I have seen plenty of romance dramas but this one does stand out. Blue is The Warmest Color goes a notch above it all, thanks to Ad\u00e8le's resplendent performance. From the very beginning you could feel the ominously prophetic Ad\u00e8le. She was able to capture the initial nuances of not being able to express her feelings to the vulnerability she faces towards the end. Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos is barely 20 years old and she was able to make you feel a cornucopia of emotions: love, passion, vulnerability, dread, a performance that truly deserves a standing ovation.Lea Seydoux was instantly familiar as Emma, (even with the blue hair), as she left a mark playing the vicious Sabine Moreau in Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol. Lea sported an uncanny charm as the tomboyish Emma which Adele was instantly drawn into and it was no surprise as even I was drawn into her performance.An absence of a prominent score or ambiance actually did wonders for the narrative. Your focus could be invested on the leads' performances and their dialogues. You hear them talk, gasp, breathe and it added a different sense of sound to the movie. The visuals all had a distinct flair to it, be it the close-ups of the leads or the calm subtle locales, this movie was able to sync perfectly with the characters' emotions.Often romance in movies are depicted too mainstream just for the sake of entertainment and we all have been conditioned to accept it as it is. With Blue is The Warmest Color, director Abdellatif Kechiche does a good job of showing the raw side of things, the romance felt grippingly authentic, it was never cheesy, and it was intense and convincing. And on that note I'd like to quote about the controversial sex scenes in the movie. Rated NC 17, the lovemaking scenes were long and explicitly graphic as well, but despite its thin veil of obvious titillation, the scenes felt aesthetic and quintessential for the narrative. I'd like people to see and accredit Blue is The Warmest Color for its absorbing drama than its intense sex scenes",

The shot is way too close. The camera gets in way to far to truly see faces and expressions. (mouths, chins, eyebrows, foreheads,) people in general are cut from the very tight camera shot. 2. This movie could have been shorten by 30 minutes MINIMUM. seriously, the child care shots, some of the club scenes. ( I would like to do my own edit of this movie, and I might sometime.) 3. The story lacks a decent flow. It jumps around to much in the beginning and you have trouble keeping up with what is going on. (bad editing again)If you want to see the same story but told MUCH better, I would recommend Kissing Jessica Stein or Better and Chocolate. 2 far superior movies than this one.

I recently saw The Page Turner on TV which I found very interesting and compelling. I do find the French's perspective on life quite interesting (I lived in Lille for a year as a teenager).This film has some basically hardcore lesbian sex scenes which personally I am not a fan of and they seemed over gratuitous and labored. However this is a French movie and they are not as hung up about this sort of thing as many other countries.The story is about how the lesbian relationship between the two leads develops over an indiscriminate time period. Which is a little discombobulating as they do not appear to age, at one point I was asking myself how a teenage girl managed to become a primary school teacher over night (would some subtitles saying 2 years later have been too much to ask?). Also the inevitable breakdown of the relationship was quite predictable (this is a French drama after all) and the fact that the character Adele was obviously bisexual and this was clearly going to create problems in the relationship.These minor factors aside it is a compelling movie and the lead actress who played Adele was fantastic. If she is not Lesbian or Bisexual this part must have been excruciatingly difficult for her. She is also very pretty which was another niggle for me as the character Emma (not the actress) was quite ugly and I kept thinking why doesn't Adele get a better looking girlfriend or boyfriend? Overall a great French drama (although a little too explicit) not as compelling as The Page Turner but a refreshing change from the usual stuff I watch.",

Then every once in a while we are gifted with something special a movie capable of showing true human emotion and the connection we have with others. True artistry separating the average everyday movies from the life altering experiences. This isn't a movie to watch with your friends. It's not even a movie I would recommend it's something that you have to come across yourself.I can tell you now the average movie goer is not going to like this, there is no basic narrative structure, no beginning middle and end. Nothing is explained or shown how times pass because it doesn't need to. You can tell that just by following the script and what's happening on screen. The sex scenes are extremely provocative and may be seen as too long. But I believe it's that way for a reason, it's trying to reinforce a point. The ending is as you would expect in a movie lacking a basic plot, abrupt and unexplained.This as well as every other NC-17 was completely over looked at the academy awards and is a real shame because on a technical standpoint this movie flows incredibly. Interesting and eye catching cinematography, amazing performances, solid direction and a realistic and relatable script all make for a intrinsic experience.As I said, i'm not going to recommend this and say the clich\u00e9 \"You're missing out if you don't watch this movie\".

With a director of Arab origin and a protagonist of Greek origin, it was in every film fans conversation in town. A film with shocking sex scenes, devoted to homosexual love among women. Very many critics pro and against, the petite bourgeois morality at red alarm. So I knew quite well what I was expecting to see.But I was wrong. Although homosexuality was the most evident issue of the movie, I believe this was not the story the filmmaker wanted to tell us. Apart from their mutual physical attraction, the protagonists belong to two completely different worlds. To make it simple, one is rich and the other, Adele, is poor, coming from the suburbs. Living together proves to be impossible, not just because of fidelity matters but of being incapable of understanding each other. Adele feels uncomfortable into the artistic environment of her girlfriend, as she is just a poor teacher who only writes a diary from time to time. Her companion's surroundings wonder how somebody may not have any creative impulses, but is contained in cooking. Their cohabitation is getting every day paler as Emma runs after her artistic dreams, funded by her parents, while Adele tries to make a living in a job she finds everyday duller. When Emma literally throws her out of her house, she is devastated, even more by the fact that she is quickly replaced by another member of Emma's social class. She realizes that sexual identity even diverge, is not enough to bridge social differences and the bourgeois end up mating among them. Her deep love for Emma comes in second place.",

It won the Cannes film festival, but when disconcerting news broke of the director's near abusive methods everyone looked concerned. Is this going to be a film stricken by its production? Fortunately, it isn't and acclaim is due where its due. Adele Exarchapoulous' natural performance is utterly effortless. Probably mostly because the film uses B-roll footage of her, but it doesn't lessen the moments when she is clearly in the moment in scenes of conflict with real blushing, tears and fits of anger. It's a really brave and committed performance. However, her primary supporting character played by Lea Seydoux outdoes her. But in her relative brevity, she has more opportunity to be incredible.The film's narrative itself is very simple, it seems to live in a world where it bounces between dancing, flirting, bickering and art. It features conversations about pop culture, books, films, music. Dialogue that would be unnecessarily long and indulgent if not for the conviction of the actors. But it's a very conflicting narrative as it's difficult to sympathise with Adele after cheating. I can empathise with the characters and really feel for them at times, but I rarely relate. It's a film with reliable aesthetics too. Great intimate cinematography with a lovely rich grade on it, crisp sound and a really engaging soundtrack. It really creates a moving and engaging experience. Blue Is The Warmest Colour is an exceptionally well-made and well-acted picture, but it certainly has no business being 3 hours long, especially as its biggest problem is a sense of time.8/10",

Quite the most amazing acting performance I've ever had the pleasure to see.How can any actor/actress produce a performance of such incredible emotional depth, with the ability to make the audience feel the emotional turmoil that she is feeling? Ms Exarchopoulos was quite remarkable and incredibly talented. Her ability to convey complex emotions for the cinema really has to be seen to be truly understood. It is incredibly rare and a real privilege to see such a performance. I have not seen her in any movies since this one but I look forward to seeing her again.This is a long movie at very close to three hours but it is rewarding and incredibly involving emotionally if you give it the time it deserves.I have nothing but the highest praise for the movie as a whole and for Ms Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos in particular.

For Adele in particular, the movie demands a lot from her role. It explores the sexual identity confusion at the beginning, to the moment when true love appears, the joys and challenges to maintain that relationship, and what comes after that. Adele manages to nail every scene by bringing out a whole spectrum of emotions.Whether it is a lesbian story or not, in the realm of movies dealing with romance I can easily rank this one as high as the likes of 500 Days of Summer, for the level of depth and honesty. It is definitely far more genuine than the pretentious \"The Kids are All Right\". La vie d'Ad\u00e8le's strength is in the raw emotions so it does not need to rely on philosophical/ intelligent points which may work in some other movies of the same genre, even though the director did raise some food-for-thought, verbally, in certain scenes that were not-so-obvious. The only thing that drags this movie below perfection is I feel there is still a lack of involvement from the side characters (parents, friends circle, ex-lovers) given that it is a 3-hour movie. There is some, but not enough. In a coming-of-age story, influence form the people around the main characters could be important factors to how relationship changes.As the Palm d'Or winner, I would be happy if it to win the foreign Oscar, but this failed to top Le Passe (A follow-up of the brilliant A Separation) in my view",

Why Abdellatif Kechiche's movie succeeds so much is because it takes a simple story and explores it in such honesty and depth that you're no longer watching a movie. Instead, you're taken to 21st century Paris, to witness the emotions experienced when a teenage girl like Adele falls in love for the first time. The film's biggest triumph, in my opinion, is Adele Exarchopoulos, the film's lead actress. She plays Adele's part with such honesty and vulnerability, she gives so much of herself to this character that you can't help but feel that it is truly her experiencing these emotions. It is the exact representation of method acting, from details like breathlessness while sobbing and panting, to the twitching and muscle spasm of her jaw when she gets tense and overwhelmed. Adele and Lea Seydoux create characters that are incredibly refreshing to watch. Nothing about this movie feels forced or fabricated. It is how you know this film could never have been the product of a Hollywood movie, as none of the movie-magic, the glam and the charm of Hollywood film making is present here. What you find instead is a passionate love story that ends in an anti-climactic and non-romanticised way \u2013 our characters do not reach closure at the end of the movie \u2013 and to me this ending is more magical and moving than any other happily ever after ending, because it hits home. It makes you think of your previous intense relationship you never really got closure on, and just like Adele, were left with just one option, to leave it all behind and march on. This film explores what it feels like to be 100% dependent on someone emotionally, how one person can rock your whole world and how as impossible as it may seem at the time, you will still continue breathing when they no longer choose to be a part of your life. And it does so in the most honest and beautiful of ways.",

            "review_title": "An honest story about love that isn't afraid not to care too much about gender",
            "content": "Abdellatif Kechiche's exploration of love, released in some territories under the title Blue is the Warmest Color, packs quite a powerful punch in terms of both emotional and controversial contents. This microcosmic three-hour epic follows the young Ad\u00e8le (relative newcomer Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos) during the evolution of her first love and sexual awakening, divided into two distinct chapters. In the first, the teenage girl is struggling with societal expectations and personal preferences. Though she physically experiments with boys, she quickly grows confused and disappointed as it doesn't seem to be able to stimulate her as she has been brought up to believe it should. A circumstantial kiss with a girl leads her to suspect she is looking for love in all the wrong places, a hypothesis soon tested out in a gay bar. When she meets the free-spirited Emma (L\u00e9a Seydoux), who has a habit of dyeing her hair blue, the two connect almost instantly, which leads them to start the road down a genuine romantic relationship, which includes many a scene of passionate same-sex intercourse. In the second chapter, we find the pair some years down the road, after Ad\u00e8le has graduated and is aspiring to become a elementary school teacher, while Emma is starting to come into her own as an artist. Despite their love continuing to flourish, the element of novelty has worn of and Ad\u00e8le considers she might have jumped to conclusions about her sexual nature as she finds herself interested in male partners after all, which causes her to be unfaithful to Emma and attempting to lie about it afterwards to no avail. Emma uncovers her infidelity and in a fit of rage kicks her out of the house. Ad\u00e8le must come to terms with the sad fact she has lost her first love due to her own faux pas, but it will take her quite some time to recover from this emotional trauma.La Vie d'Ad\u00e8le must surely have been an extraordinary ordeal for the two young actresses carrying the piece in terms of filming. Kechiche tells Ad\u00e8le's story relying on close-ups for most of the film, their every facial nuance laid bare, which makes us feel like we're right on top of them continuously. Correspondingly, the two women also spend a lot of time on top of each other, in a number of quite explicit lesbian sex scenes that leave next to nothing to the imagination, covering the entire range of physical positions you can think of where two women are involved. Though this apparent excess of groping, fingering and tribbing appears titillating at first, these scenes carry on for far longer than feels comfortable for the audience. However, they are yet another natural part of the everyday love life of these girls in the director's mind and as such ought not be censored for the sake of the audience's own inhibitions, nor are they meant to arouse. Accusations of blatant pornography cannot be wholly dismissed, but clearly are not Kechiche's sole intentions, whatever the levels of controversy and thus publicity these scenes might spark. In that regard, he also holds little interest in the homosexual nature of the mutual love he examines. Though at first the concept of a girl falling in love with a girl and the views thereof in society, i.e., Ad\u00e8le's high school and home environment, relate the usual notions of otherness and awkwardness, the story quickly evolves to the point where that fact simply matters not. Though the two women don't openly flaunt their love for each other at every turn, the gay side of their relation is quite apparent yet never the subject of open criticism: these are just two people in love, it's as simple as that for Kechiche. Whether it is intended as such or not, it's quite a statement to make in contemporary France, where homosexuality is still a matter of heated debate and even violent confrontations. Kechiche doesn't seem to care about current day politics. Realism, and realism only, is key, as he illustrates by making effective use of improvisation throughout the film, the script only used sparingly to help the actresses establish their own natural rhythm of conversing and interacting, instead of merely adhering to the lines written down. It's a monumental task for any actor/actress, no matter how experienced, but both of them succeed to completely convincingly results: Exarchopoulos in particular is to be applauded for the achievement of portraying the inexperienced Ad\u00e8le to such compelling success, considering her own lack of experience in terms of acting. La Vie d'Ad\u00e8le deconstructs the theme of love entirely, from its inception to its brutal ending, its joys and its horrors exposed, fully justifying its running time of 187 minutes despite the risk it carries of discouraging the audience. Kechiche is not afraid to end the movie on a note of ambiguity in regard to Ad\u00e8le's own understanding and weathering of the concept, as she is confronted by the mark it has left on her. Sometimes love is a blessing, but an equal amount of time it's a curse, the director remarks.",

Initially, she is in denial about her homosexuality; friends suspect so but she vehemently denies it. Upon joining a gay friend on a night out, she seeks this young woman and the first encounter occurs.This follows a series of dialogues and sketching before the two women embark on an affair. The intensity, tenderness is incredible and both parties are consumed by it. All good things must come to an end, and Adele by breaching fidelity pays the ultimate price.This film is a story about Adele. Adele though occasionally comes across as a simpleton (she often finds herself saying: I don't know about this or that') she has a magnetic quality about her so that those who will encounter her, fall for her. She loves intensely. She gives herself completely, but naively she does not realise that mistakes carry consequences.This is the finest LGBT film of recent times. Beautiful portrayals, some almost poetic dialogues, and a sexual intensity that depicts the passion that ought to exist in such relationships.Unmissable!!!",

In regards to the explicit scenes, they do not stick out of the rest of the film. Admittedly, it was understandable why it was NC-17. At a runtime of 3 hours, it seemed like certain scenes ran too long. For example, the characters eating spaghetti, and focusing on Adele who does not have the best eating manners seemed unnecessary.

Blue Is the Warmest Colour) does a great deal to fill the void, and sets a benchmark that all future films in this area will struggle to live up to.The French films' strength is in its actors, and especially lead actresses Adele Exarchopoulos and Lea Seydoux. The film leans on their talents heavily, with numerous long, tight-focus close-ups of their faces throughout, as well as several long, intense sex scenes, but they carry the burden and come through with flying colours.There are reports that director Abdellatif Kechiche was intimidating, even exploitative, towards the cast and crew. I do not know if this is so, but if it is, it only makes me respect them - and especially the teenage Exarchopoulos - all the more for going through this ordeal and emerging from it with a piece of work that any of the finest actresses working today would be proud of.For my full review, go to my independent film review blog on Blogspot, Cinema Inferno: http://cinemainferno-blog.blogspot.co.uk",

            "content": "I'm often deterred from watching films when they're as long as this one, saying \"I'll watch it when I've got time\", but in this case I thought I'd give it a go. What a fantastic decision, I was hooked from start to finish. Blue is the Warmest Colour is a Bildungsroman which follows a girl named Ad\u00e9le from the age of 17 to her late twenties, a time during which she finds herself through sex, friendships, and a beautiful romance with a girl named Emma. I don't think I fully appreciated how drawn in I was by this film until it was over. As the credits began to roll I was suddenly overwhelmed by an emptiness knowing that I would no longer experience Ad\u00e9le's life with her; and that you do. I'm not sure how, but somehow this film transfers its protagonist's emotions and experiences onto the viewer perfectly. You don't just watch Ad\u00e9le, for the duration of the film, you are her. This was particularly true of the sadder moments in the story; when Ad\u00e9le was hopeless and desperate, I too was hopeless and desperate. This ability, in my opinion, is the film's greatest virtue, and allows it to masterfully fulfil its requirements as a Bildungsroman. The film has gathered some controversy regarding its sexual explicitness. Certainly it is the most sexually graphic film I have ever seen - even more so than 'Enter The Void', which is given a nod in the cinema scene early on. The first sex scene between Ad\u00e9le and Emma lasts at least ten minutes, and nothing is left to the imagination. However, these scenes are in no way gratuitous, they are in fact excellent. The display of passion in these scenes is so vivid it inspires awe. In a way I found this also so effectively smashes any taboos that may exist about on-screen sex, particularly homosexual sex, that the 'shock factor' is correctly diminished, which makes the sex incredibly natural, as it should be. It also has the effect of displaying the significance of love in sex, and the importance of love over sex. Love is portrayed equally vividly to sex, which is a fine achievement on the part of the actors and director.Finally, the acting is phenomenal. It is the acting of the two protagonists that really makes the film the masterpiece that it is. There isn't much more that needs to be said about it, it is simply wonderful. To conclude, this is a drama that envelops the viewer in a turbulent sea of agony and ecstasy with masterful skill, well worth its 3 hour run time. Watch it immediately.",

The film follows Adele, a junior in highschool who is struggling with depression, anxiety and her sexuality. The movie is about her journey of meeting Emma, a girl with blue hair who is comfortable with her sexuality. Adele learns through Emma to love and how it feels to be love, she discovers what she wants to do in life and how it is ok to be open and honest with yourself. It also explores how not every romance is perfect, the film is acted brilliantly, the roles are cast well. Adele looks a tad too old to be a junior, but she still looks highschoolish age. She plays the part of a nervous girl very well. I really enjoyed how most (Keyword MOST) of the sex scenes in this movie signify something, the first one is Adele alone, the second one with a man, and then many others with Emma. I really enjoyed how this movie moves along. Maybe it's because I broke it up into 3 parts but I found it was in this weird place where the story never really picks up, but it also never really stalls either. The only scene that I felt went on a tad too long was the last 10 minutes of it. This movie has a few loose ends that are never really tied up, but I also think that's ok in a film like this, The film shows how some people can do what they want easily, and others have to settle into something they like. I would strongly recommend that you break up the movie a bit like I did, since it really allowed me to digest everything that was happening. I think it also helps if you have a small understanding of French. (I don't know a lot, but some of the small words and phrases aren't subtitled so being able to follow can get tricky at times) Overall, I really enjoyed this film, and I hope to see more dramas like this that can actually hold my attention. 8/10",

            "content": "It is mainly Ad\u00e8le (Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos)'s story of growing up: falling in and out of love and finally finding herself. But it is so tragic that as we follow her path, we naturally ache and cry with her. The film starts with Ad\u00e8le the insecure teenager feeling out of place in high school. All her classmates talk about are boys and sex. She is lonely and longed to be loved and accepted but young Ad\u00e8le is confused and insecure. Her family is nice but she cannot talk freely with her conservative parents. Ad\u00e8le is not shy about sex but cannot seem to find the right person until she meets Emma (L\u00e9a Seydoux), an art student with blue hair who is also interested in philosophy. Emma's free spirit fascinates Ad\u00e8le and soon they become inseparable. Emma has everything Ad\u00e8le is yearning for: independence, confidence, artistic talent, and inspiration. With Emma, Ad\u00e8le can express herself freely without being judged. Naturally they become very intimate. Very graphic and passionate sex scenes here showing their lack of inhibition and mutual respect. But the irony is that exactly because Emma is so free-spirited, it is hard to tie her down. Exactly because of Ad\u00e8le's longing for love and care, she easily feels lonely when Emma is not around. This relationship is doomed to failure. Isn't it familiar to all of us that we are attracted to somebody because of X and this precise X eventually and inevitably becomes the reason we break up? It could happen to any couple but it just happens to Ad\u00e8le and Emma, a same sex couple. Their sex could be awesome but once the trust is broken, there is no turning back.The acting is excellent. Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos is so naturally pretty and expressive in portraying Ad\u00e8le. We can feel the pain and regret in her. But Ad\u00e8le has every right to be angry too because Emma was not there when she needed her.The romantic, sweet and graphic first half of the film has, after this point, gradually evolved to be sad, painful, and devastating. The director pays tribute to reading and literature teachers and the readings in the classroom serve as excellent narration of the movie: there is no need to understand everything; it is an unavoidable tragedy although it is love at first sight; when you part, part of you is lost.\" I was glad that in the end Ad\u00e8le gulped some champagne and stormed out of the gallery. She has finally grown up and makes her own decision. It is a film about love and how much one is willing to give herself up for someone she loves. But it is also on how destiny fools us: since Ad\u00e8le is more mature than her peers, Ad\u00e8le finds revelation in Emma. But because Emma is more mature, Ad\u00e8le will have to catch up forever and it is doomed to end in disasters. Excellent story though sad. A tragic romance, but to move on, one can choose to hang on to the fond memories.",

            "content": "For anyone with any tolerance for very typical French cinema, BITWC starts out well. As well as the immediate presence in every frame of something blue (more on that later!), there's some foreshadowing of events to come in the subtext of a long opening scene as students read passages on 'being a woman' and 'love at first sight' etc in a literature class.This is where we first meet our heroine, Adele. Now, this is not a rom-com (by any stretch of the imagination) so if you need to 'like' your protagonist, this may be a tough watch. Adele is not the most endearing of leading ladies. She's in turns reticent and chatty, though has an annoying habit of eating with her mouth open and talking with her mouth full. Pedantic? It's far from aesthetic, let me tell you! Furthermore, for all the fuss about the sex and nudity in this film (more on that later too!), there's far more time (and that's a lot!) spent watching people eating (mostly spaghetti - is there a visual euphemism there?). Eating and dancing. There's a lot of that in here. OK, the food thing is a conceit - there's a heavy handed metaphor equating eating with sex/love, appetites and tastes etc, even to the extent of eating oysters being compared to eating 'you know what' - which they then do. So the pouting adolescent girl that doesn't like oysters meets the annoying self righteous blue haired lesbian artist (who loves oysters), and before long Adele gets to eat some of those metaphorical shellfish in a seriously long grunt and arse slapping filled sex scene that really could have been half the length, if not less.That said, after all the fuss about the long intimate scenes in the film, this was the only one that felt too long in the context of the piece. I say in the context of the piece, which bear in mind is three hours long, and DOES NOT NEED TO BE! Everything in this film is drawn out beyond reason. Overlong scenes of people dancing. Long shots of Adele sleeping or smoking or eating. Always eating, but then she does admit to her love of eating.I tell you what, thank goodness for subtitles - saves trying to understand what people are saying when they're too busy stuffing their gobs to say their lines cleanly! Of course, the relationship inevitably goes pear shaped (since oranges are not the only fruit) and in some ways that's when the real drama begins. Both leads nailed the neuroses of young love turned rotten, and I would have rather seen more of this and less of the explicit sex, which can only serve so much narrative purpose before it becomes stagnant and something teenage boys will put on in isolation. OK, don't get me wrong. BITWC is wonderfully performed. The two leads deserve the praise heaped upon them. The film is well shot and very watchable. It is typically French in a lot of ways, which I love as well as find frustrating.It would be easy to say that it should be an hour or more shorter, and that the editing is sloppy and undisciplined, but no - that's the film the filmmaker wanted to make. That aside, it's actually far more televisual than cinematic. It's almost exclusively told in medium close-ups of people, with wide shots few and far between, which makes it feel intimate and tells you it's about 'people'. That's great, and it does indeed draw you in so that you feel 'inside' this sometimes clandestine relationship, but is it great cinema? I was yearning for some wider shots and something more visually evocative, some respite from the characters even. There is something 'blue' in almost every frame of the film, be it a blurry poster in the background, a front door, or a bus station - this began to seriously irritate me after about the first half hour, as it became apparent it was either just unimaginative production design or the title of the film is wrong.It sounds like a damning condemnation, but if this was a three part TV drama, it would have been perfect. As a single helping, three hour opus about something as familiar and straightforward as someone coming of age, it's just too long, too ponderous, and too everyday. And hey, I love Betty Blue! For all that, the performances alone are more than enough to keep you in the story, and I'd personally far rather watch three hours of this than nearly the same of some convoluted, badly plotted and full of inane action like The Dark Knight Rises.That's hardly high praise, I know! In all, when a film picks up plaudits as this one has, it's hard not to go in with high expectations and ultimately be disappointed. Is it a good film? Yes, of course it is. Is it special? Only for the commitment of the two leads to two wonderful performances. Is it a 'great' film? No, not in the slightest. Still better than most",

Watching High school movies and seeing the generic clich\u00e9s over and over, this one really stands out. Nothing is put in to sugarcoat life. Its stripped down to the naked truth (litterally). Also, I like to warn about the nudity, porn scenes in this movie. Something that wasn't made clear in the summary.Young Adele is also not as young, and that shows, especially in the physical aspect. But the actress portraits every emotion with grace. Something that makes the movie worth while. You get involved with her life and choices, you see her for who she is. I can say that all actors, even though they are supposed to be young students, feels very real. And that is perhaps why this movie is so intriguing.",

            "content": "This year's Palme d'Or winner (which usually means nothing) \"Blue Is the Warmest Color (or \"La vie d'Adele\") is a perfect example of a film of two halves. The first half (on its own) is one of the two or three best movies of 2013, in its social importance, technical excellence and fresh commentary on the journey of adolescent sexuality. Unfortunately, the second half (the final hour and a half) veers down a fairly generic \"trouble in paradise\" path, that (despite the heavy nudity) will cause many to check their watches.Synopsis: When Adele, a teenage plain-Jane, can't figure out why she isn't into the other boys, even though many seem infatuated by her, she meets a rebellious girl with blue hair named Emma, who ignites a desire in Adele that she never knew she possessed.When people use the term \"coming of age\" to entice me into watching a movie, I usually cringe. But in the case of \"Blue Is the Warmest Color\", the coming of age aspect (the first 90 minutes) is the only part of this movie which really blew me away.As far as the direction goes, the use of colors (mainly the color blue) is undoubtedly as impressive as anything director Abdellatif Kechiche brought to the table. Suffice to say, this is shot beautifully. Undoubtedly one the most gorgeous looking films I've seen all year.The Sex Scenes: Lea Seydoux (whose performance was literally one of the only positive takeaways from \"Farewell, My Queen\") is tremendous here playing Emma, the lesbian who falls in love with Adele. And so is Adele Exarchopoulos, who plays the blossoming flower, Adele. But with a rating of NC-17, what this movie will more than likely be remembered for is the extremely graphic, seemingly unsimulated and awkwardly long lesbian sex sequences, during the halfway mark of this movie. While these sequences do serve to show Adele and Emma in their most exposed states (physically and emotionally) and are undeniably visually erotic, after about a minute or two, it is my firm belief that they don't really serve to push the story forward. If anything, at around minute six or seven of one of the sex scenes, Kechiche's only intent seems to be to make every audience member over the age of 60, walk out of the theater.Final Thought: This film is predicated on the hypothesis that the times when characters are not speaking are more important than any dialogue spoken. Hence, what you get here is a lot of lingering gazes and moments where you think someone is going to talk\u0085and then they don't. Not to say that these scenes aren't emotional, just know what you're getting into. While many may be totally immersed in the highly emotional sequences of this beautiful love story between the two women, others may be done with this very slowly paced film after about two hours and become more enamored by the numerous shots of Adele's runny nose every times she cries (if you've seen the film, you know what I'm talking about). Anyway, even though \"Blue Is the Warmest Color\" will not garner a Best Foreign Film nomination at the Oscars on a technicality and even though I can't fully recommend this to everyone (mostly because of the runtime (again, IT'S THREE HOURS LONG!) and predictability during the latter half) this is worth seeing for the first 90 minutes alone.",

            "content": "Adele, (Adele Exarchopoulos), has her mouth hanging open a lot. When she is eating, she talks with her mouth full, her hair in the most incalculable mess I've ever seen. She is in high school, but she could also be a third grader in the park, looking at all the strange people around, sometimes catching her hair with a bit of her peanut butter sandwich. Everything about her exudes youth, inexperience, and curiosity. So a dissonant moment occurs when we first see her exploring herself on her own sexually. But instead of imagining the boy she's just made out with for the first time, she thinks of the girl with blue hair she saw walking around with another girl. She knows she is missing something, and when she catches a glance of the girl again, she decides to not let her go this time. An inevitable meeting occurs. And this is where I fall in love with Emma, (Lea Seydoux).She is cool, confident, experienced, artistic, sensitive, and is drawn toward Adele, drawing her in and listening. She wants to guide her, protect her, answer her questions. What is it that she is attracted to in Adele? It is hard for me to buy it at first, but Adele seems to represent purity, innocence, she is different from all the people that normally swarm around Emma. It is also interesting to take into account the fact that Emma is an artist. She's hungry for success, she wants attention and respect, and here she has an inquisitive and sincerely interested follower. This is attractive.Adele discovers satisfaction and happiness, but even as her relationship with Emma grows we watch her float shyly through this new reality she's broken in to. She doesn't feel comfortable outside the protection of Emma's embrace and we see it get increasingly hard for her. Adele feels insecure as she struggles to fit in to the art world about which she knows nothing, while watching Emma's friendly and beautiful friends carry on as they've done for years. The thing I love here is that despite her discomfort Adele continues to fight and try her best. She does everything she can to hide her feelings and put on a brave face for Emma's circle. But it soon makes her feel isolated, to be an onlooker and to pretend; the very things she'd run away from in the beginning of the film with her first brief relationship. And her reaction to this feeling shows us that she is still learning about consequences, the most valuable and difficult ones still to come.In one of Emma and Adele's first conversations, they discuss Sartre and his writing about how \"existence precedes essence\" and how it is the choices we make and the actions we take that define who we are. We are not born with the values we learn to cherish, we construct them from the experience of living, based on what we embrace and what we reject. Adele is young and impulsive, she follows her desire and is unwilling to settle for something that does not satisfy her. But she ultimately fails to see the value in investment, in understanding that what may be attractive in the moment is not enough to sustain her for life. She was lucky enough to find someone who could potentially sustain her for life, but because she needed a band-aid she let her sexual desires take control, releasing her mind from responsibility. We watch the experience of that pain wash over her as she is kicked out of Emma's place, her face and hair a complete mess. The camera's dedication to close-up shots of faces keeps us constantly in tune to the ebb and flow of emotions.Adele struggles to get through her daily life and her job teaching young kids. She eventually gets to meet Emma at a restaurant and once again we see the emotional loss coming to the surface as she does everything she can to try and get Emma back. But Emma is such an amazing character to me. She works as a foil for Adele's character, a distinct contrast as an adult who deeply cares for Adele, but can not wait around for Adele to mature into the partner she needs. She was betrayed and this, despite the sexual attraction she still has for Adele, is something she can concretely process in her mind and refuse to excuse as someone who respects both herself and Adele. She is so strong, and tender at the same time. She knows what she wants in her life, and has constructed herself into the person she wants to be, just like their Sartre conversation, her essence is defined by her life as an artist, as a lover, but also as someone who uses her mind and power of reasoning to avoid the same mistakes that have led to Adele's pain, and may happen again and again before Adele finishes her own transformation.",

My heart was broken by the end of this movie and it left me in tears thinking so much about everything. I praise Abdellatif Kechiche's artistic genius and his ability to leave me wanting more even after 3 hours. Through the whole film I feel as though I can really see the characters, it's an intimate feeling because everything that is captured is so real, from the way they eat to the way they express emotions on their face, it's INCREDIBLE. To be able to pull this film off, one would need fearless actresses who give everything they have into the work. Ad\u00e8le and L\u00e9a were PHENOMENAL.

Starring Adele Exarchopoulos and Lea Seydoux, this outstanding drama runs the emotional gamut and features terrific performances from both female leads, Exarchopoulos in particular, who is truly mesmeric. The essence of Blue is the Warmest Colour concerns themes of self-discovery, but this is a rich text, and one that also portrays the results of discrimination, bullying and peer pressure -- whilst understanding that divisions are present in life. At 2 hours and 59 minutes, this is also a lengthy film, and one that moves at a stately pace. Scenes play out far beyond what may be considered a normal, or cinematic, resolution. Instead, seeking to delve deeper in the psyche of the characters, especially Exarchopoulos' Adele. The sex scenes are also lengthy, unflinching and absorbing in their intimacy. This may be voyeurism writ large, but the graphic nature of the girls' physical love is key to understanding their desires, motivations and a want to be part of something real. Adele's relationship with food shouldn't go unnoticed, either. Her voracious appetite for nutritional nourishment matches her sexual appetite, but draws a correlation in her initial lack of grace, to a change in tastes and feeling a sense of belonging through food and through sex. This is a remarkable film, one of 2013's finest, and I don't say that lightly. It's daring, provocative, but has an emotional undercurrent that's pure electric.",

Both actress are wonderful and perfect for the characters but Adele's actress (Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos)is something out of this world.The director of this movie will spend most of the times making close ups of her facial expression. And i am glad he did so. She is so expressible with her face that, most of the times, she does not even need to talk. The mix of cute \"girl next door\" innocence and honesty in her looks will take you over and make you literally feel everything that she is feeling.She was a revelation.Now, the plot behind it all is not something new. There a e a number of movies talking about the teenage confusion with the discovery of their sexuality. But this one is directed in such a way that will actually make you care and understand.As i said, most of it, in my opinion, is about Adele's phenomenal expressibility. Also i really like that they took their time with the movie. Almost 3 hours is a rare thing nowadays and some don't appreciate it. In my opinion so many movies could have been masterpieces if not chunked into a 90 minute standard that don't allow the history to settle and feelings towards the characters to be developed by the viewers.This movie is also very honest. The dialogues between the teenagers are genuine. The reactions, slang and values they have are spot on (i know, i grew up in France). This unlike Hollywood movies where, depending of the movie genre, teenagers look to stupid and immature or overly deep for their age.The sex scenes are almost explicit. At some moments i was unsure about them. Were they faked or real? I couldn't tell. But this is not really important. They are a vital part of the history and the ferocity applied on them are essential to understand the relief and satisfaction that Adele finally found.The whole film would be worth watching only because of Exarchopoulos cuteness and innocence masterfully used to reveal the essence of the plot. But then we have many more layers that make this history special.I left the theatre feeling things i didn't felt since i was a teenager. This little pinch in your hearth that you have after a special moment with the correct person, the excitation of a probable love, or the painfully, sometimes tragically pleasant sensation of let-down and nostalgia with whom life strikes you down times to times.I felt all that watching this movie and i even staid inebriated with it a couple of days afterwards.This is a French masterpiece with 2 spectacular actresses and 1 face for the ages. Gay, Lesbian or Straight, it does not matter. Watch it. As a Straight man who sometime feel that 2 beautiful lesbians together is a waist (it's my envious side taking over), i ended up rooting for Adele and Emma.I still am!",

An extraordinary performance from Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos is the outstanding feature of this film.

L\u00e9a Seydoux as Emma has more hard edges. She is as difficult to read as Ad\u00e8le is easy. The performances save the film from poor choices that reveal indulgent directing and editing. Ad\u00e8le's appetite for sex, dance and food is shown in over-long takes that, in their length, add nothing to characterisation or narrative. Typical bourgeois conversations about art and philosophy reveal their banality an interminable two or three minutes before we ever cut away from them. The fact is, had this been a heterosexual love story, it would not have received half the attention. Unfortunately, the camera puts a male gaze onto the lesbian lovers and as such fetishizes them. Around 90-120 minutes would have been sufficient to tell this story, and give it more power. A good film, but one that, regrettably, scuppers its own chances to be a great one.",

The film's themes are the sexual awakening and sexual identity construction in adolescence, the tearing force of desire, the bliss of its fulfilment, and the hollowness and meaninglessness resulting from loss.Is it a film with a gay theme? No and yes.No, it is not, not in the sense in which we are accustomed by other gay-themed films. The classical themes of gay films, the clash with and rejection by the society are lacking, the society's intrusion into and wrecking of the life of the gay person is absent. There is only one scene where this is briefly touched upon and the gay bashers are rash minors, hardly society's representatives. The theme of the disappointed parent is also absent. On the contrary, in one case, accepting and open parents are shown. Nevertheless, in another case, the discretion and hiding of the sexual orientation from one's parents is present but not prominent. The focus is on Adele and Emma and not on their relation with society. It is an intimate drama and not a socially conscious film.And yet it is a gay-themed film simply because a part of its value is drawn from concentrating on a story of homosexual love and desire. Had it depicted a heterosexual relationship it would have been completely banal. The long, carnal, earthly sex scenes shout at us that we're watching a depiction of desire, for the other, for sexual possession, for plenitude, for fulfilment in intimacy and union with the desired person. Had the pain of separation and the consequent life on auto-pilot, hollowness and drifting resulted from the break-up of a heterosexual couple, it would have been d\u00e9j\u00e0-vu. Somehow the need to highlight in a homosexual context the feelings spectrum that come with the birth and death of a relationship makes \"Blue Is the Warmest Colour\" a gay-themed film.So \"Blue Is the Warmest Colour\" is a love story. But in this lies its greatest weakness: While our first big love in our adolescence is something magical when we live it, unique, it is also something that we see with a certain detachment later on. The conscious strife for universality, for the big themes in art sometimes falls flat and dangerously approaches the trivial, the boring. The narrowness of the focus does not succeed in lending depth to the film. The outcome is a long heavyish atmosphere of a film taking itself too seriously and leaving the viewer indifferent.On a brighter note, larger compositions that include many constantly moving characters in the same frame, such as the party scene at Emma's or the celebration at the end of the school year in Ad\u00e8le's primary school, bring a much needed lighter air and are crafted with evident talent.A note on the title: The original French title is literally translated \"The Life of Ad\u00e8le\". While less poetic it is more appropriate as it faithfully fits the film's subject.",

It is probably possible to view this as a lesbian exploitation flick, but I suggest it is much more than this. Although the director is not French-born, he makes you feel that you are living in a provincial French town, living at home, attending high school - and entering the world of sex. Masterful direction, photography, and acting. He captures a remarkable and incredible performance from the younger woman playing one of the two leading roles. If you look up the word 'naturalistic' in the dictionary, you'll see her photograph. Makes all other actresses look 'actress-y'...Someone told me that the reason they might read a book or see a movie is because they want to experience another world. This is that other world.",

At over 3 hours, you will begin to wonder why certain scenes focusing on minute aspects of the story did not hit the cutting room floor, just for the sake of keeping one's interest in the heart of the story alive. (If you watch this, you'll see what I mean and yes, I'm fully aware that I make that statement as an American movie watcher who is used to condensed everything). That said, this was a truly sweet and heartbreaking romance film that I'm very glad I watched.

It's not a lesbian film judging from the outer part it is but if you go to the core it's not . Sometimes we love but they love us even more we feel we are not enough we leave . Sometimes we love then we stick into it. Sometimes we love even though we hide it that doesn't change anything because it's pure love . To be honest I really hate gay films because I grew up studying in a Christian School and we all know about the Leviticus blah blah blah .

In fact the film could have benefitted from an strong independent editor who should have cut about 90% of the sex scenes and around 60 mins over all.\nHowever I am not a fan of 3 films with a few notable exceptions, this isn't one.I am not quite sure who the editor was as it seems 5 names are listed, a case of too many cooks spoil the spaghetti metaphor maybe?

Opposites are attracted, though differences in music, food, culture, education, and sexuality (gender and presentation). It's art but it doesn't talk down.Instead it takes us by the hand, and the spirit, into worlds we'd only explore if we had a guide to make us feel safe. It's voyeuristic but by invitation; it's argumentative, but by social democracy. If I strip away the the gloss of the art exhibitionism and the wrappers of the artists who hide behind their true characters, I'm left with bare naked humanity.It may well be Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos' mesmeric and almost unreal beauty which allowed me to last three hours, but there were sub-titles to read as well.This is a film about taking your clothes off, losing your inhibitions and being a free human.",

When she meets Emma her world is turned upside down. The film shows her life and her struggles as she grows alongside Emma. Although the ending was sad, it led to the thought of new hopes and new beginnings. The acting was amazing. Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos was phenomenal. She was very expressive and she played the part extremely well. I really liked all the actors chosen for the film. This movie taught me to hold onto the best things you have and don't make stupid mistakes. It is all too easy to lose your true love. The movie was very realistic and it had a certain rawness to it that made you crave more and more. I was never bored throughout the 3 hour film and I would definitely say that the film moved me as a person.The part with Ad\u00e8le and her friends calling her lesbian was very realistic and also ironic since one of them is gay. I thought that that portrayed high school life well. I also really enjoyed how you could see all of Ad\u00e8le's life and her growth. From her as a young girl who dreams of loving Emma and then to her life as an adult and as she has to move on. This movie is also not afraid to hide anything. I really liked that because it showed Ad\u00e8le's whole life, and it didn't hold out sad scenes, sex scenes, etc. One of my favorite parts of the movie was when Emma and Ad\u00e8le meet for dinner after not having seen each other for a long time. Although they can no longer be together Emma says : \"But I have infinite tenderness for you. I always will. All my life long.\" Another quote I loved was when Ad\u00e8le said : \"I miss you. I miss not touching each other. Not seeing each other, not breathing in each other. I want you. All the time. No one else.\" These words were so beautiful to me and something I will remember. The infinite tenderness quote I think is very true. When you break up with someone you once loved, I believe that you will always have an infinite tenderness for them. Something I would've wished to see in the movie was Ad\u00e8le come out to her parents and maybe have more of an acceptance for herself. Also maybe more with disabled kids at school. Another thing would be Emma breaking up with Sabine because that is not really covered. Lastly, of course I wish Emma and Ad\u00e8le would have ended up together and she wouldn't have cheated, but not everything can turn out right. Something else is really liked in the film is the symbolic meaning of the color blue. With Emma's blue hair, blue is \"the warmest color\" because of the warmth and happiness Ad\u00e8le feels around Emma. Also later on in the movie after they break up, Ad\u00e8le floats in the blue ocean, and I feel like that was symbolic because the blue water may have been a way to remind her of Emma and to feel the warmth of her somehow. Towards the end of the movie, Ad\u00e8le goes to Emma's art show and wears a blue dress. A friend of Emma's comments on it and the color is seen as how it relates to Emma. One last thing I would like to talk about in this movie was the sex. With the long sex scenes in this movie you can really see the love and passion these girls have for one another. I thought these scenes were very real and well represented. Also they show little touches, such as when the Ad\u00e8le and Emma are laying naked. It is so beautiful and as Ad\u00e8le slowly touches Emma's leg, you can really feel their love for one another. Something so simple, made the scene really stand out to me. In the end this film was phenomenal,and I highly recommend it to all 17 and older.",

Some of the languid, sweaty, scenes of tribadism, which are unencumbered by the leer of the sensualist, offer cinematically rare insight as to what Sapphic cuddling is about.

            "content": "The 2013 Palme D'Or winner from Cannes Film Festival, La Vie d'Ad\u00e8le - Blue Is the Warmest Color, is indeed a complex movie to review... Director Abdellatif Kechiche brings to the audience the portrait of the early adult day by day life of a young girl, Ad\u00e9le, with a stunning performance by 19 year old actress Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos, and in particular her love relationship with another woman, Emma, through a very unique visual style and approach. This a good movie, no doubt about that, but there are certain aspects that can be questioned. First, the length. The movie lasts for 3 hours and don't get me wrong, it is no pain at all, but there are so, so, so many scenes that should be cut out in the editing room that it feels we are watching just too much pointless scenes throughout the movie. Yes, it is a unique style to show the day by day, thoughts and expressions of Ad\u00e8le, but was it necessary? Is it conclusive? I don't believe so. On the other hand, there are so many plot points that really should be addressed due to the nature and approach of the movie, but are instead ruled out with no explanation at all: themes that are introduced and then put aside like Ad\u00e8le's parents reaction to her homosexuality, or a relationship that unravels later in the movie. The movie is unbalanced in form and subject: if all those day by day pointless scenes are excused due to this being a movie about Ad\u00e8le's whole life (in her young adult years), then why does it keep coming back to the \"relationship\" theme, then gets out of it, then presents another plot point that, when it starts being developed, just leaves it and goes back to the \"relationship\"? Why does it keep presenting the same scenes? Blue Is The Warmest Color is a good movie, with great performances, a good European feel and a eye catching unique directing style, that unfortunately just feels unbalanced in structure.

Adele is a high school girl who cares too much about what her friends think and isn't honest with herself or her parents about who she is. This is pretty typical for the average adolescent. Emma is a pretentious college student who looks down on everyone that doesn't live and believe exactly as she does. Also sounds pretty familiar right? These women represent the most vulnerable and most annoying phases of life. They think everything that the do and feel is so important and earth shattering. Nothing like this has ever happened to anyone else. No one will ever understand them. This is annoying in the way that most movies about young people are. They are at the age where most of what they do is annoying. Adele is so sure that Emma is her soul mate. Their relationship is shallow. Their lives don't intersect. Their love is like a summer camp love that exists outside of the real world. Emma is annoyed that Adele isn't like her but also attracted to her innocence and newness. It is very difficult to like either of them. They are both overly emotional. This is a young adult angst movie with love and loss whose central figures just happen to be a lesbian couple. It is a refreshing movie that would never be made in America but it is not the best movie you've ever seen.",

However, the performances of the two leads draws you in and makes the whole tale compelling.There are a couple of lengthy explicit sex scenes and I can understand some will consider them porn masquerading as art. They definitely aren't for the prudish but as the relationship plays out it is a necessary part of understanding the deep emotional impact Adele and Emma have on each other. Every aspect of an ultimately doomed relationship is played out in front of you, time is taken to show how these feelings develop. There is only one minor criticism where Adele and Emma are shown as having moved in together without any scenes where it shown how that came about and it is as though an important scene has been cut from the middle.The performances of the two leads are outstanding. I was getting more emotionally invested in the characters as though they were real to the point that for the first time I can remember a film made me cry.I recommend this with the caveat that if you are prudish fast forward through the sex scenes.",

This film is so special first of all because it is so real. Nothing is hidden. When the characters eat, sleep, laugh, cry, have sex, everything feels totally real. This film represents everything a typical Hollywood film is not.It seldom happens that there seems to be a sense of perfection in a movie which combines all the elements that make the movie an amazing work of art and this film has them all. It starts with the screenplay which is intelligent, moving, honest, touching. The cinematography is magnificent. It consists of a lot of close ups but not only. It is the kind of cinematography which corresponds with the story perfectly. The editing right on the mark. Kechiche is in no rush to go anywhere. He takes his time but when he cuts he knows exactly when to do it and how to do it. And above all the acting. Exarchopoulos and seydoux are absolutely brilliant in every aspect. This are the best performances I have ever seen. And I saw almost all of mike liegh's and lars von trier's work. This acting topes them all. Adele and emma are real people. You get to know who they are step by step up to the point you forget this is fiction. Their passions, desires, ambitions, conflicts. They are naked in every aspect not only the physical one. you feel them. You laugh with them. Cry with them. It is the strongest, touching and close you can ever get to fictional characters on a movie screen.And such magic could never have been accomplished if there wasn't a cinematic mastermind behind all that. Abdellatif kechiche is a true genius. I recommend this movie to every human being with a heart. go see it. This film is something really special.",

It is not easy, it's full of emotions, bad and good,The film is strange at times, I was often wondering where it goes from certain point, but it always delivered.Great film, will recommend!P.s.

            "content": "This is an epic coming of age story, coming in at 3 hours I genuinely wanted more. Director Abdellatif Kechiche gets so up close and personal it almost feels like a documentary. He shows incredible balance (it could have felt voyeuristic but it doesn't), nothing feels forced. The events unfold as if unscripted. He's just opening a vivid window into Adele's life and we will simply experience whatever comes to pass.\nHe tells the story of Adele (Adele Exarchopoulos) a school girl struggling with her sexuality, her identity and seeking purpose in life. She meets the older Emma (Lea Seydoux) who has blue hair (it warrants a mention), confidence and is totally swept away by her. We witness the story of their life and love and loss over (maybe?) seven years.\nAdele is mesmerising. Natural, compelling, her travails seem genuine and affecting. Her love burns like phosphorus, her pain is excruciating. She visibly grows in front of you. Going from timid school girl, to someone empowering but all the while vulnerable. It is a simply outstanding display of acting and she gives everything of herself.\nEmma (Lea) though on screen 70% of the time, feels more of a foil and though very good can't help but be blasted off the screen by Adele. The remaining ensemble are top drawer. Each carving out a chunk of screen time so as they appear and reappear you innately remember them.\nThe are two obvious talking points for me. One is the intimate sex scenes between Adele and Emma. It must be acknowledged that European cinema is more risqu\u00e9, albeit comfortable in this environment. For me it's all justified if distracting (critically). It's the intensity in their passion that is a defining character of their relationship. It's an explosion of love. It's vital to the selling of the characters. The fact that they're numerous and lengthy is balanced by the duration of the movie and wouldn't creep above a \"screen time percentage\" of any other such expos\u00e9.\nThe other point is the obvious disparity of ages of the characters. In real life Lea is 8 years older than Adele. I am not as au fait with the French education system, so talk of school and college year didn't clarify things as much as it might. Emma does elude to Adele being \"underage\". We witness an 18th birthday for Adele but how long has passed in the story? There is an obvious \"what if...\" question but even in this case I still felt a bit uncomfortable about the nature of their relationship at indeterminate respective ages.\nIt remains an easily recommendable movie whether you want to view it under the LGBTQ banner or not. What makes it essential though is the performance of Adele Exarchopoulos. EIGHT",

But the film is so much more. Adele is an introvert teenager who finds love in Emma. The ups and downs of her subsequent life are the essence of the plot. What I liked most about the film is that the queer angle does not overshadow the feel of the film. It is essentially a love story; that the lovers are queer is very natural, maybe even incidental, to the plot. That the story does not beat its breasts on the discriminations faced by the protagonists lends it an exceptional gravity. Both the lead characters are written with nuanced detail. Adele Exarchopoulos turns out an exceptional performance. The way she eats, cries with a dribbling nose and sleeps with an open mouth makes her so irresistible to me. Lea Seydoux is also a knockout as her fiery, dominant lover. There is not much to the plot, so the film primarily depends on the performances of the lead, and they don't disappoint. The three hour length is a bit of a drag, especially in the second half, but Adele is so beautiful that I wouldn't mind looking at her even for a lifetime. The cinematographer makes extensive use of close ups to make the viewer fall in love with both the characters. The sex scenes are not only boner inducing, they are vital to capturing the passion of the romantic relationship. Effective use of lighting and colors is also a highlight of the cinematography. The screenplay is notable because Adele appears in every scene (reminded me of Polanski's Chinatown) Overall, it is an endearing love story which deserves a relaxed watch.",

            "content": "Such a beautiful work of art. The colour, performances all enlighten this film into a modern classic status and excellent anyone starting in french cinema.There is so much to praise about this feature. Running at 179 minutes, it is no small motion picture, yet dotted throughout are near perfect moments of dramatic cinema. At the heart of this film lay its two greatest anchors, the screenplay and leading performances.Adele, played by Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos is the first that we are introduced to, the young and slightly reserved student who will have the romance of a lifetime. Her performance I believe is a tiny bit stronger than her counterparts but there is truly very little difference in quality between them. Though her career has been short and this being her first major endeavour in film, this may be what defines her in the decades to come. Truly this is one of the greatest performances of the decade. She delivers the bewilderment and fear while infusing the want for adventure, for something new. The film explores the characters wants and desires, even if she is jittery at first. She played this conflict superbly, and then her constant want and need for Emma. Then in post break-up they are in animosity, and the heartbreak and onset once again of fear is beautifully delivered. Once upon their meeting anew, she portrays the emotionally bruised, numbed and now more flat Ad\u00e8le with such prowess and pure talent. Truly this is one of the best performances I have ever seen in a motion picture.On the other side lay Emma, portrayed by L\u00e9a Seydoux. Her performance is almost on par with Exarchopoulos, but has slightly less of the gravitas, but is still truly an outstanding performance in its own hard earned right. The performances strengths lay in the rawness of the emotions, for Emma is less reserved, more loud and adventurous than Ad\u00e8le. Emma is the one who leads Ad\u00e8le, and Seydoux portrays this perfectly to every note. The audience feels great empathy for both characters throughout the film, and some are even left ambivalent about who to root for in the later acts of this film. For both are so superb, and have strengths in different places, and this sparring between them that is present in almost every scene they are in truly rises the film into its most magnificent moments and cinematic achievements.One must comment on this films cinematography and how this works side by side with the costume design, make up & hairstyling and direction. The films title is 'Blue Is The Warmest Colour', and the colour blue is present in almost all scenes, and many of the individual shots. From Emma's hair, to the coats, shirts, wall papers, water, sky, cafe's and so many more that I failed to catch. This stylistic choice is extremely clever, albeit common, but is executed in a thoughtful and artistically pleasing manner. The cinematography has graded the films shots to compliment the emotion of the film, in particular as it follows Ad\u00e8le. Scenes of anger feel raw, focused and sharp; love is deep, rich and layered; happiness is also rich, multicoloured, and extreme closeups. The angles all compliment the emotion and tone of the scenes they employ, this is an achievement that a lessing amount of films employ in the modern era, and to see a film use it so extensively and successfully is truly worthy of great recognition.Put into companionship with the cinematography, the set design is made ever more effective by the colouration. Displaying the difference in setting most effectively, for instance the difference in architecture and design between a house and educational institution. The costumes all complimented the characters, no silly promotional or reference shirts that I could notice, it allows the audience to focus entirely on the character and delivered wonderful suspension of disbelief.The screenplay is one of the great assets of this feature. How it depicts the love, in particular this Lesbian relationship, having to keep it somewhat quiet, the societal conflict that lingers within Ad\u00e8le all are truly well delivered. The intensity of some scenes, both loud and quiet is extremely well crafted, in both inter character fights and the wonderment of this entirely new world and life that Ad\u00e8le is exploring. The film sustains these themes for the entirely of its run time, without using cliche or breaking it unnecessarily. Every scene feels like it contributes (almost) to the overall narrative. Its as if it (almost) is a very tight ship, no leaks, it all flows so naturally (almost).Despite this, some moments of this film are on the weaker side. I felt that it was maybe a little too long, some scenes felt a little unnecessary and I felt that the art gallery scene wasn't as well executed as could have been. In addition to this, the music felt a little bit forgettable, however this could have simply been as I am relatively new to non-english language cinema and wasn't taking in the sound as well as I do in my native tongue. (And not the 'Almost's become relevant): But now, I must mention the graphic lesbianism in this film: I felt that it was professionally performed and the camera angles were revealing and the colours were very ambient of the 'loving' atmosphere present in those moment. But over fifteen minutes of (dis)continuous sex across the film is a bit excessive. As Chris Stuckmann said: 'Some consider it high class French porn' - I cannot say that those people are wrong but I wouldn't go that far other than to say it was a bit excessive and overly graphic in places, but I do understand what Abdellatif Kechiche was trying to achieve, to display the intense love between the two characters, it was just 'overly done'.At last, I must overall say that this is truly a wonderful film. It may not be for all, I can understand that the runtime and graphic sex may put some off, it nearly put me off, but this truly worth seeing for its masterful direction and performances with outstanding technical aspects. It keeps the suspension of disbelief on more successfully than almost all other films, it is truly an immersive experience. And a great starting point (Like the film Am\u00e9lie) for anyone looking into foreign or specifically french cinema, and one of the best films of the decade. 4/5.",

Emotionally it has so strong load thanks to all: directing, superb acting, precise and very attentive camera work, and of course still so delicate homosexuality theme.

There's the obvious similarities - both are about lesbians, and both not about lesbians, both coming of age dramas, scenes such as the teasing from classmates - there are also technical similarities, close ups of faces looking lost, that brutal realism (Dogme?). And like Moodysson, this is sometimes hard to watch because it's just so close and intrusive.Anyway there's so much this movie gets right that doesn't even occur to you as you watch - casting, acting, lighting, music and so on.. one thing that stood out a bit (so a bad thing) was so much of the film consists of faces in the same close up wobbly style. Fortunate then that Adele is enough of an actress, and be honest, has an attractive and interesting enough face to sustain it. (There's a weird blurring of reality here with the use of out of character shots and name). It's the sort of performance that could be hard to ever top.The sex scenes are already famously erotic and for once they're (sort of) both justified and sexy. one criticism that they come across as a male fantasy, long, and indulgent. so you could argue they aren't necessary, but then none of it is necessary. it's effective though.The beginning of the story is surprisingly fast paced. The middle 2 hours is a phenomenally focused and carefully constructed drama, innocent to sad. I found the ending a bit anticlimactic, but that could just be that i was sad it did end - you're going to have to come up for air some time.All the philosophy and art discussion doesn't really add anything for me either, perhaps works better if you can follow in French without subtitles. When you start to analyse it, there's lots that isn't subtle here - the oysters, the classroom discussions on love.. but it doesn't matter, because the acting and directing has you.So yes, it's a flawed movie, but a passionate one, in every sense. A great reminder of how what film can do, and what most films, for whatever reason, don't do. I'll be looking out for the director's other work!",

            "content": "Sometimes it is impossible to draw the line between pornography and artistic requirement in a movie. \"Blue is the Warmest Colour\"'s non-sexual content is enough to make this an outstanding film, what with the languorous yet mordant microscope with which director Abdullatif Kechiche looks at the life of an adolescent girl. Adele (Adele Exarchpoulos in a once-in-a-lifetime role) - the central character who courses through this movie like a sensuous reflective breeze- is a remarkable high-school girl to begin with: she's intelligent, spunky and attractive, with intellectual chops to boot. She's presented to us with such a sense of balance and honesty that I could never label her fake or labored. The hitch in the craw erupts for her when she discovers her lesbian tendencies.That's where the boyish-looking Emma (a well-calibrated Lea Seydoux) enters the scene -her blue hair grades into her natural blonde later in the film and that change becomes confluent with the changing tide of this magnificent 170 minute picture. And then there are the graphic sex scenes: flat-out shameless and so devoid of artifice that it knocks out any remaining curtain of modesty. It is this blend of physical boldness and emotional wallop that makes \"Blue is the Warmest Colour\" a very rare picture. No wonder it won the Cannes Palme d'Or 2013.I thought Adele by herself was a nice mix of Jack and Ennis of Brokeback Mountain (a greater film and one which has no graphic scenes) Her answer to \"What's your favorite subject?\" is a gem, comparable in simple but perfect wisdom to what Marji of 'Persepolis' says when asked \"Is sex really what it is made up to be?\" Kechiche also takes a running kick at the classes of abstract literature that Adele attends. The female-female dynamic plays in wonderful off-key notes compared to a typical male-female relationship.The assiduous mostly hand-held camera only rarely calls attention to itself, and when it does it is praiseworthy -from hectic tracking shots to sharp whip-and-focus.Few movies have watched a girl as intently as this one does. Short of showing her in the toilet, the director lets us witness all other facets of her life - even the day to day putatively banal scenes that several other film-makers would have ignored -but it is always interesting, in fact it is a privilege to watch this acutely followed record of her life. Adele writes a diary which she shows to no one, but we are able to to continuously see the real life that dictates that diary's contents. That is a pleasure which is beyond voyeurism.For full review and other cinema analysis, you may visit www.upnworld.com",

So overall the movie is predictable and doesn't have a lot of substance, but it's also not bad; it's just average.I am conviced then, that this film would hardly have been noticed without the sex scene. For better or worse that scene and the controversy it sparked is the reason this film is know at all. So was the sex good at least? Well, no. The scene looks exactly like two actors going through the motions. As commonly is the mistake, as soon as clothes come off, all characterization is thrown out of the window.

This story would most definitely not be my normal fare.\nA Sapphic friend of mine had recorded it from national television and persuaded me to watch it with her. Not wishing to view it alone.I subsequently learned Exarchopoulos is the youngest ever actress to receive Palme d'Or award in Cannes. And it was for the part she played in this film.\nI will make a direct with the late great Lauren Bacall. She was the same age as Exarchopoulos when she appeared in To Have And Have Not\nIn her role. She exhibited such poise, professionalism and confidence. She almost acted the seasoned Humphrey Bogart ' of the screen '\nExarchopoulos on the other hand. Appeared like a rabbit which has been frightened by a reptile for much of the film. Not helped by a peculiar tick. Exhibited even when she is feigning sleep. Of keeping her lips apart and revealing to prominent upper teeth.\nHer wavering and indecisiveness even appeared at times. To distract Seydoux. Her co-star\nthroughout the film.Something which was NOT her fault for much of the film. Was her hair which appeared to have a mind of its own. I tend to be oblivious to female physical attributes. Including hair. So for me to notice it had to have been bad.\nDo film studios no longer employ wardrobe and makeup artists of late ?These professionals used to be fastidious in checking their actresses and actors before they appeared before camera. In the traditional period of Holywood. Stars looked immaculate even in action sequences set in hostile environment. A great shame this little detail is no longer preserved.These observations aside. My friend was of the opinion. That as a romantic ' chick flick '\nThe story worked.\nDespite my personal view. The sheer volume of nudity and salacious deviant behaviour\nWas gratuitous and excessive. That is why I am being generous in my review of the film.\nWhich clearly met its mark despite a lamentable performance by its star.\nTo those who enjoy Sapphic intrigues. I do commend it.",

However, there are generally only two outcomes of gutsy film-making: brilliant or outrageously terrible. This movie has certainly hit the mark of brilliance.Many moments in this film I found myself digging deeper and deeper into my seat out of shear embarrassment; and moments later leaning forward into the screen out of intrigue. It ignites a roller-coaster of emotions because the movie takes it's clothes off and leaves itself bare to the viewer, which can be uncomfortable. To that Art would say, 'Mission Accomplished'.There are many praises I could give this movie. But, I will leave that to the countless awards and nominations they have received for this controversial film. A warning to the viewers though, if you are easily offended and are of a conservative nature, this movie does push boundaries for the sake of art that may make you uncomfortable. Another great movie by Abdellatif Kechiche.",

We don't just see it grow, we feel it. Time is spent showing how Adele slowly accepts her feelings of longing for another woman, and in creating the bond that forms between she and Emma. In doing so, the film earns every emotion. This union feels authentic, because enough care was taken to make it honest and real. Both actresses work jointly to create something identifiable to audiences, no matter whether they're straight or gay. It's some truly beautiful work.Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos's performance as Ad\u00e8le is exceptional as she deals with family, peer jealousy, education and her volcanic sexuality with Emma (L\u00e9a Seydoux) all at the same time.",

The first time around I let the explicit nature of the love making scenes get to me, which was the point looking back. I didn't even finish the film. If I did finish the film, I would've seen why the scenes were so explicit. Though I still think they're over the top. I do think I have a better understanding on why maybe the director that it was a good idea. Still a complaint of mine though.Okay. Adele. I related to her so much this watch. I really put myself in her shoes. This film is an emotional rollercoaster. If your like me and your in school, you've probably had a crush. Do you ever have a crush so big you feel like you'd never like someone as much as you like this one person? That's how Blue Is The Warmest Color feels. We see in the end Adele only wants Emma; but she can't have Emma. Adele is left hopeless and has to cope with the fact that she can't have Emma back. Adele is one of my favorite film characters of all time. She is so far from perfect it's sad, but so am I. So are you! If you think your wrong 'cause your not.I think I love this movie with almost every fiber, but I can't give it that five stars because I've heard the actresses \"felt like wh***s\" on set...\" I don't like that. I know I'm running around in circles, but this time around I really saw myself in Adele and felt every emotion possible. I cried at parts the director definitely didn't expect a guy to cry at.",

            "content": "Finally watched the movie last night after letting it sit months in my Netflix streaming cue (the three hour length put me off) and almost a day later I'm still touched by it. Based on a French graphic novel by Julie Maroh, the story focuses on Ad\u00e8le, an introverted teenager from a working class background trying to find her place in life like most teenagers. She has well meaning but practical parents, her high school clique of gossipy girlfriends and eventually a boyfriend, but there is something in her eyes and expression that says she wants more. She finds it in Emma, a self assured middle class lesbian art student. Ad\u00e8le and Emma exchange a passing glance in a park one day that changes both their lives forever. They eventually meet and begin an intense, passionate love affair. Anybody who has felt the euphoria of first real love and the prolonged, messy agony that love can become will empathize with the leads in this movie. L\u00e9a Seydoux's Emma is a powerhouse of strength and secret vulnerability, while Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos' face throughout the movie reads like a map of depression and sadness that not even love can totally brighten. She seems overwhelmed by life and the charisma and force of Emma's personality. The sex scenes are very explicit and what everyone is talking about but if you get into the story, they feel more intimate than exploitative; after all, that is what people in relationships do. One of the most beautiful, touching, and heartbreaking films I have seen in a long time.",

            "content": "Kechiche has achieved what Sofia Coppola has been trying to pull off her entire career: A movie that doesn't feel like it was written. Don't worry, I still love Sofia. But lets not compare 'Blue is the Warmest Color' to her; lets compare it to 'Blue Valentine.' Both narratives follow a romantic endeavor from conception through gradual decay. But 'Warmest Color' is more effective because it features in chronological order - making the break-up scene much more jarring. Both films maximize the full potential of method acting. However, Kechiche one-ups every other director by filming the actors eat while they're actually hungry. Like 'Valentine,' 'Warmest Color' gets its point across through undercurrent and subtext. Adele and Emma are characters that exist in their own right (albeit fictionally) rather than as plot vessels. The filmmakers took a massive risk by replicating reality rather than adhering to story structure: And it paid off!A common complaint about 'Warmest Color' is that it's too long and yes, I do agree that the editing could use tightening up. But this flaw is forgivable because the film has migrated as far away as one can from cinematic convention while still being entertaining. On a personal level, I had a bit of trouble appreciating the story because the director's signature greatly overshadows every other aspect of the film. It's hard not to appreciate his refrain from using dolly and crane shots; the absence of makeup; and the shallow focal depth of the his lens which so delicately depicts Adele's solitude.Few films linger in one's mind long after initial viewing: Fewer films convey discomfort without alienating the viewer. With that said; 'Blue is the Warmest Color' is a masterclass on low-budget production value. I give it 9/10.On a side note: Lea Seydoux looks fabulous as a butch with short blonde hair.",

But in doing so, I felt very drawn into her thought process, which made the story of her romance to Emma that much more powerful, despite the language barrier and the relationship's keen specificities. Being so drawn in proved very helpful during the breakup scene. On it's own, you see a woman scorned and the sad stupidity of her unfaithful lover fighting a lost cause. But because we know so much about that unfaithful lover, I felt worse, because I know what led her to this place and was sad she couldn't articulate it in the moment. It added to what I think is the film's major achievement -- showing how an ecstatic love like Emma's and Adele's can end up feeling so isolating. Highly recommended.",

In the movie we saw a lot of sexual romantism.\nAlthough most viewers are uncomfortable with this, my personal idea is that these scenes has no bad influence on filming.\nWhen Emma and Adele leave each other, we see that Emma moves on, establishes a new affair and continues her work but when we\nlook at Adele, it cannot be said that she is un-accustomed with this situation because she couldn't find someone another to re-gain her sexual satisfaction.\nI think Emma's goal for benefit and Adele's search for emotional satisfaction shows these two classes of society very well: Luxury ones and normals.\nIf I talk about lesbianism: I think society should break the prejudices against homosexuals, if we do not break this in the coming years,\nwe won't have any difference from Adele's school friends.",

This gives her a confidence but also a self absorbed aspect to her character. Whereas Adele has been taught by her family to think about her future, get a practical job and to contribute to society. Giving her a sense of caring for the wider community but also making her feel insecure in the light of the creative and artistic world that Emma lives in. The film shows how these differences can subtly grow and can create loneliness.

This film is not pornographic or sex-centric: not only shows nothing very explicitly, but hot scenes occupy no more than 20 minutes divided into segments, compared to the other two and a half hoursHowever, \"La vie d'Ad\u00e8le\" does not become an explosion in the brain as you expected. While the sex scenes are the best (shows many things but with thin strokes. Titanic work of the director and the actresses are insured), the little problem with miss Adele is: much more conventional than our expectations. This is a story that has been in an infinite number of tapes in the format of heterosexuality, about the turbulent relationship of two people to end up as good friends (eg \"Annie Hall\"). But in this film the things works with a different twist: they are lesbians. This happens a chronology of the sexual life of the protagonist that names the title, but it is seen trivially, as parts of the person: She impresses arbitrarily with the blue-haired girl on the street (\u00e0 la \"Desperately Seeking Susan\" where Arquette obsessed with Madonna), discovers that she is not interested in sex with men, frequents gay clubs, she tries to save appearances with her parents, kissing with a partner, etc\u0085 They are very good moments, but there is no insight, and homosexuality does not get the discussion that shouldThere are some warps aimed to touch the discomfort society of this type of sexuality. The first is the shame of Adele with a friend at school by discovering her lesbianism. Here many students the school maintain a diverse but stupid position: some look askance at homosexuality, others does not condemn it, but any of the positions are buried by the juvenile folly and lack of perspective that age to build something useful and helpful neighbor (eg one of the men make gay jokes) . The second is with parents: when Adele tries to maintain appearances with them to introduce to her \"friend\" and not to reveal her sexual identity. But the good moments are not reflections, and the parents of Adele in the last hour of footage are buried, disappear of the screenshot(Danger: Spoilers in this paragraph) Because the plot seems to be trivialized, some flaws that undermine the common sense because the film is about lesbians: there is infidelity by one of the girls, but this deception is with the other sex, indicating that they can change so quickly, as if sexuality were a revolving door. It is true that homosexuality is primarily a disorder for the individual by the confusion that must feel and taboos, eg tell to your parents (or suppress it, hide it), so interruptions of the common sense regarding the \"sides\" with what you want to stay, are continuous. But in the present case, the sexuality was already sharp enough for that failure logic of the scriptThis review continues on my personal Tumblr, which has no commercial purpose nowhttp://reviewsandthecity.tumblr.com/post/70707492998/blue-is-the- warmest-color-film-review",

This film hit me really f*cking hard!It was perfect in every way it came out. From the beginning to the ending you feel a deep connection with Ad\u00e8le, I've never seen an actor give such an emotional and powerful performance in a roll ever. The 2 girls really blow my mind away. During the whole film I never thought \"wow, those are really good actresses.\" It was like you're in the film together with them, jut looking from a far.It just like what Steven Spielberg said: \"It's a privilege to be a fly on the wall, and to see the story about what Ad\u00e8le & Emma make trough.\" And you really do! Somehow you can relate to the story, because everybody has been trough such emotional pain (i think?), certainly with something such as love. It can be beautiful, but it also can really hurt. The film really needs more recognition. I think it was a really powerful masterpiece, together with the astonishing performances of both the actresses, Abdellatif Kechiche really made one hell of a film. The guy sets the bar really high with this. I don't think I'll get the same feeling soon from another film, that I had with this one.I hope you will enjoy it, as much as I did.",

            "content": "It's not very often that when you watch a movie you feel like not watching a movie. The first instinct was why is it taking too long for something to happen. Come on! this is supposed to be a movie, then as we go on we slowly start realizing that it's not the kind of films that we see often, at least I can speak for myself. It has a different pace. The movie as it slowly unraveled I felt like reading a novel, just that it is being simultaneously pictured. It could be also because of subtitles. The story follows young Adele who is about to turn eighteen she has a fling with a boy, which doesn't come off well or she doesn't feel it to be special. Time will pass by so does the boy. She ends up being kissed by her girl classmate, which turns out nothing but just a kiss. Later on she wanders into a lesbian bar where she would meet Emma, a graphic artist/ painter. Rest assured that they fall in love.One thing that struck me and will remain with me long after the movie gets over, is the fact that it's as close to real life as possible. There are long stretches of Adele coming home, going out, eating, sitting, hanging out which all together make the movie almost three hours. But that's not all just like daily life it too has interesting moments and not so interesting times too. Soon we follow Emma and Adele who has moved together. Adele becomes a nursery teacher and Emma working to make it big. But we see Adele realizing that she feels out of place with Emma and her artist friends. Slowly their relationship wears out. Adele is seen dropped off by her male coworker. Upon confrontation by Emma, Adele reveals that she slept with him. In this scene Adele impresses us when she begs for sorry only to be left out. As life goes on we are shown that parts of Adele's life that are brighter like the one where she dances in a school function with the children or when she plays with them in the beach, she cannot enjoy the moment. It would take time for the wounds to heal. Then finally Emma and Adele meet up in a restaurant. One of those moments when you realize that other person will not love you anymore. Not that she hates you, just that it's over and still what you shared will remain special forever. In these scenes both the actors have excelled. This film is about Adele's life, the good times, the bad times, her first love, break up. It's not just the story; it is more about the characters Adele and Emma equally matched by the actors. Film is not over and life will take its course. Emma has her first art show. Adele attends it. A moment where one realizes that you just don't belong to a place and probably will never, Adele leaves...walks onto the street, off course she was wearing a blue top!",

They were slow and didn't really add anything to the story; they didn't seem to have any point in them, except showing a family dinner. Though is has gotten much hype cause of the graphic love scenes between the two women, It didn't feel like its take the focus away from the main story. (Though, it probably made great PR for the movie.) Some of the lesbians scenes though I felt moved to fast. One scene she dumps's her than newly acquired boyfriend because she's insecure about what she wants. This is normal for some teenagers I guess. Than next we get to learn that one of her closer friends are either a lesbians or at least bi, by way of a kissing scene in a girls bathroom, but when Adele try to hit on her, she get turned down with a line that it was only for fun, Next thing we know Adele is hitting the male gay bars with a gay friend Than suddenly the group of friends isn't all that close friends anymore, when they suspect that Adele is gay or at least bisexual To me that was a bit incoherent and made no sense Also she goes from being insecure and shy to real open about it really fast .I would assume there are a few steps they go through, though it is probably individual. I interpret it, as way to show that some time had past by since the last scene. But I could be wrong, I just found it confusing. I found it really fascinating & refreshing that you almost never see any cell phones or computers in the movie at all. There is also hardly any background music which kind of made you feel you were there living in the moment There was no people sitting with their face buried in the computer or talking on their Smartphone The scene where she was caught cheating was a bit to American and to typical American movies (dunno who stole what from who) If you gonna cheat on you lover, why would you let the person drive you to the very building you live in, than sit in the car and make out for another 5 minute, knowing very well that you can be spotted by your partner, from the apartment window. At the end, when they have the heart to heart talk at the caf\u00e9, I got the impression that Emma Admitted to have screwed the pregnant lady, while she was with Adele (Am I the only one who got that impression?) which means they both had been cheating on each other, at the time when they were together. This again made Emma a hypocrite Some of the kindergarten stuff was a bit strange, but all in all I liked the movie surprisingly, but in a way it kind of reminded me of the movie Lost and Delirious only in French, but it was good I think both actresses performed really great",

L\u00e9a Seydoux and Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos were both amazing at capturing the rawness of their characters. I love the scenes of daily life happening throughout the film, like when Ad\u00e8le is walking to school and she happens upon Emma quite briefly, and through a chance encounter she meets her again when she happens to go to a gay bar with her friend. Their conversation seems very intimate from the start and blossoms as the film progresses. Emma opens a whole new world for Ad\u00e8le and at the same time Ad\u00e8le becomes the muse for all of Emma's works. It shows that honeymoon phase of relationships and then the phenomena known as \"lesbian bed death.\" Emma is engrossed in her work, is working with someone she has more in common with in regards to art, and Ad\u00e8le feeling lonely and neglected seeks attention from a male colleague. She gets caught and it starts a train reaction of drama, crying, and yelling, and snot dripping down Ad\u00e8le's face. One would think from the start of the film, it would have a happy ending, but alas it does not. Emma moves on whilst Ad\u00e8le is left alone and still not over her. It shows us that love is brutally painful, and maybe just maybe cheating isn't such a good idea. I thought this film was brilliant. It wasn't a cheesy lesbian film, but it had depth and substance. The sex scenes I thought were rather intense and surprised me as The L-Word set the precedence for racy love scenes, but the scene in this topped it. It was rather lengthy for an intimate scene and made me think how uncomfortable I would have felt as one of the actresses if I had to portray such realism by being natural despite all the lights and cameras. This film is one f the reasons why I'm a big fan of French cinema.",

I am telling you that this film will make you feel love, lust and loss. An intense combination which is executed perfectly, also thanks to two BRILLIANT performance's by Adele and Lea. If you want an easy going standard romance, this one is not for you. If you want a film which makes you feel the emotions I noted before, then watch this! You will not forget this movie and it will have a lasting (emotional) impact on you. My only PERSONAL critique is that it leaves you high and dry. If this wasn't the case it would be a 10/10 for me.

            "content": "It is hardly surprising that \"Blue is the warmest colour\" has been tagged as the most controversial film since Antichrist or maybe 9 Songs; two films that premiered in Cannes and shocked audiences around the world due its controversial content. But unlike Lars Von Trier or Michael Winterbottom, Abdellatif's story about two homosexuals is one of the finest pieces of art I have seen in quite sometime. The film is a study on French culture, food, art and music as much as it is about love and relationships \u2013 both spiritual and physical. The story revolves around Adele, an introvert high school girl, exploring her sexuality and trying to cope up with the realization that her inner self relates to women rather than men. She meets Emma, a fine arts student who is more matured in character and older to her by age, a relationship largely portrayed through a series of intense sexual encounters. The film explains how Adele opens up her personality to be close to someone she truly loves and cares about. The intimate scenes form a very important part of the film, and the story will definitely be incomplete without the raw emotions it takes us through. Yes, they are quite explicit and can make you uncomfortable; but they are also shot artistically (although many critics have argued that it was simply mainstream pornography). What I enjoyed the most here is how well the director has portrayed the female body for all its perfection. You can't help but admire how beautiful the two protagonists were, all bare. However, the film's highlight is undoubtedly Adele Exarchopoulos, who plays the title character Adele. She puts up an incredible performance as Adele, an adorable youngster, who displays an array of emotions throughout the movie \u2013 the standouts being the scenes with her red cheeks when she is teary eyed and her beautiful smile. You almost feel like living her life and falling in love with her \u2013 her emotions are very deep and raw. Lea Seydoux, who plays the role of her partner Emma, also puts a very credible performance. Their chemistry is undoubtedly what keeps us afloat in a movie that stretches to almost three hours. With no background score (except for sounds captured from the surroundings), no make-up, no lead male actors, and a controversial content, this may not be everyone's favorite film; although, I am very certain that this film will find many devoted fans in Mr.Skins.com \u2013 which is indeed a shame. I would recommend this important film mainly for its two main contributions to mainstream cinema \u2013 an exceptional talent in Adele, and a beautiful love story. Go for it. You will be happy you met Adele.",

            "content": "At first I was a little bit sceptical about watching this film, having heard others say that it lost the sense of the graphic novel and that the sex scenes were ridiculous or too much. However, I think that although it is not a pure film version of the novel, it has its own different merits.First of all, I liked the way in which the relationship was shown. It was not the typical homosexual relationship film which focuses on the angst rather than the actual love itself. In this film the relationship is shown in a way that is much more similar to most relationships in films, which is a refreshing change for LGBT cinema. Although, it can also be said that there were moments in which the problems of a lesbian relationship can be seen, such as the homophobic comments from Ad\u00e8le's friends when they saw Emma the first time.The other thing that I felt was executed well was the timing of the film. The film is along one, no doubt about that, however it kept me captivated for the whole length. It didn't feel excessively long and there were very few unnecessary scenes, which were mostly sex or people smoking. This in itself is an achievement worth noting.Probably the most spoken about matter in this film is the sex scenes, their ample number and their explicit nature. It is true, they are long, and after the first couple of minutes the longest one between Ad\u00e8le and Emma did seem to drag. After a while I did feel as though the sex scenes were not really adding anything to the film. But, saying that, they did not really detract from it either. It's also probably worth mentioning that, as everyone has already said, these scenes are very explicit. However, once you get over that and just watch it, it's not that bad and they don't seem totally pornographic.My only main criticism of this film is the characterisation of Emma, although this will most likely only be applicable to those who have read the graphic novel. I did not like the way that Emma is shown to be so much colder towards Ad\u00e8le in the film than she is in the novel. She just seems a little bland until the final argument between the two. The film is so focused on Ad\u00e8le and her feelings it has lost a whole dimension of emotion from Emma. Although, with the ending of the film it is much more understandable, but I feel as though Emma's character was lost a little and made Ad\u00e8le seem like a clingy child.But, slightly awkward sex scenes and Emma being bland aside, this film is definitely worth watching. It is an excellent way to see a whole relationship from start to end. Exarchopoulos' performance is absolutely wonderful, as a watcher you can almost feel what she is feeling. This film will perhaps break your heart, especially because of the way that the watcher gets to see the relationship grow and then fall apart. The way that we see life afterwards for Ad\u00e8le also adds a certain depth to the story, and makes the ending so much more painful. The look on a lesbian relationship is so refreshing as it's not all about the misery of being gay, it is purely about the trials that normal people face in a relationship. I think that it will be a great way for people to start viewing gay relationships just like any other.",

That is the reason why I choose this movie to add my watchlist. However, I did not learn a lots from this three hours movie, because it focus too much on the erotic content. Maybe it is the real reflection of Europe lesbian life, but I still do not feel the connection to express the homosexual love. Comparing to Carol, Blue is the Warmest Color tends to miss a lot of emotional connection between the two main actresses. It focus more on the teenager rash and lust, instead of the inner affection to each other and struggle to face the world. Just like other teenager love, Adele and Emma eventually end up into different paths of their life, and what Adele truly learns is the identity of herself. When she says \"I do not love you anymore.\" to Emma, she grows up to a real women. At that time, Emma becomes more a mentor than a girlfriend to Adele. The highlight of this movie is the experience of growing up being a lesbian and how to move on.",

It's absolutely not that I am a prude and disapproved of the scene, it is purely having to watch such an explicit scene in the company of others. After the scene was over I had an over whelming desire to announce the uncomfortable nature of the group viewing just to ease the tension in the room. That said the film is OK, I would have given it half a mark less if I was able to but thought I'd be over generous, rather than over critical. Some things bothered me about the film, overly long lingering shots of the main characters lips (facial feature here, although fair enough if you thought otherwise!) and lots of chobbling of food, not a thing I enjoy seeing or hearing. I feel that the film could have been more enjoyable if it were about 45 minutes shorter, same points could have been made. That said, the time drifted by without me constantly time checking and I felt suitably entertained when I left the cinema. Quite a nice story, nicely shot, acted and told.",

Adele proves to be a persuadable girl of dubious sexuality up to that point in life and after reading a passage in a book about love at first sight, she convinces herself she has that feeling when she comes across a blue hair girl on her way to a first date. Honestly I don't think Adele is Essentially a lesbian but as mentioned above she is moved by fixed ideas she's just set on her mind and ACTS in consequence but later we'll find out why Emma falls out with her. It's also of importance the quick, clear portrait of Adele's family we get into the dinner scene from where we should ask ourselves: Is Adele following her real lifelong passion or is she ,again, influenced by familiar paradigms when she chooses teaching.(a stable job) Is she being truthful to her own feelings or partially bogus? On the other hand we have Emma, with a way more \"straight\" character, in the sense she acts what she is, there's no half measures with her, What she DOES is what she IS. She feels no shame in admitting her homosexuality and her relationships towards parents is sincere and smooth, different to that of Emma. Her essence is set forth so unmistakably that, I think she lives a happier life than many sham people-.",

The story is a basic coming of age tale about a young girl named Adele who falls in love with an older woman named Emma. Both characters are very interesting to watch and are expertly played by both their actresses. The film is shot very well and the entirely French dialogue adds to the beauty. Many people's complaints with this film is that the lesbian love scenes go on for two long and they do. Although everything in this movie goes on for too long. Now don't get me wrong, I love a three hour movie when there is enough story to fit that run time. This film just doesn't have the story to fill out all 179 minutes so many of its scenes go on WAY too long and are filled with too much mundane dialogue. Maybe that was an intentional artistic choice but I didn't really do much for me. All that being said, it's defiantly worth a watch if you can get past the subtitles which I know is a problem for some people and also the homosexual themes which could make some people uncomfortable. Even with its flaws, Blue Is the Warmest Color is a touching, beautifully shot story of love, heart break and acceptance that manages to hold up even with it's story being too stretched out.",

But, everything just fit together right, the acting made it all work (I believe this may be down to the filming style of the director) the characters seemed genuine, the acting was so brilliant from the main leads that at times it felt like more than just a movie. Yes, the development of characters is flawed IMO but this is down to it's presentation style. The sex seemed intense, very awkward for the viewer IMO (very voyeuristic), but important for the development of the relationship. I will be honest, I felt like I hyper-analysed every scene but I was gripped from beginning to end. This movie has fascinated me ever since I first heard of it's competing at Cannes '13 and I didn't manage to see it but I will admit I am now glad as it is definitely a movie which requires a high level of maturity which I didn't have at the time, waiting until now allowed me to embrace the true nature of the film. Overall, not perfect but every scene had meaning and purpose towards the story, it was a brilliant experience.

I love the way that it was shot, small details like the sunlight framing a kiss or focus to small natural movements. Everything from a technical perspective in this film felt real. I saw myself in the characters.On a more emotional level, I found that 'Blue is the Warmest Colour' created a whole world of connections and feelings that were raw. The film catches the way people actually do things, now i'm not talking here about the sex scenes (which I found quite tasteful and fluid in line with the other scenes), I am talking about the way teenagers bully, teachers have lives and people grow up, the whole way different people adjust to the world, comparing paintings and discussing travel. It does remind me of a lot of people I've met in life who are always searching for something more, something to complete them, something to fulfil them. Adele and Emma are vivid and believable characters, who have different perspectives on personal fulfilment and ambition that is subtly challenged and coaxed by other preliminary characters to reveal a diversity of lives. Overall, a film that comes across as realism but leaves you dreaming of all the things you could have done or will do.",

It had flaws (the friend ehowho sure that Adele is attracted to her was unconvincing, why are they fine with her friend who is gay but have a problem with her being gay?) But I feel like those can be ignored. The way that Adele's attempt to find out how she leans sexually is interesting and I think the actress did a great job. \nHowever, from the sex scene with Emma onwards it kind of seems that the movie lost its focus. The beginning started as this interesting look into Adele's character and her exploration for her sexual self. The way it's presented, especially the fact that Emma and her don't just do sexual things but have deeper dialogue adds to it. The fear with movies like this is that it's gonna just turn into an excuse for making a film filled with lesbian sex scenes to attract straight men audience. I think that the first hour overcame that pretty well. Their relationship is not protraid as two actresses being sexual with one another but rather two characters in a relationship. I think that sex scene just ruined that. It's not that there is a problem with having a sex scene in this movie but rather how long it went on. At a certain point it just makes you lose whatever connection you had to these characters. It's not even only the sex scenes on their own, but rather the way that they are used. Movies CAN have a lot of sex scenes and still be great movies. A great example is John Cameron Mitchell's Shortbus. The movie had multiple sex scenes. But they weren't just that. The movie uses them in a very unique way; as a tool to explore the characters. It introduces us, the audience to this very personal side of the characters in the beginning. In my opinion a movie like that uses sex as part of who we are, whereas I felt that Blue Is the Warmest Color made it so distant from the personality of the characters. It spits in the face of any prevopre character development. Overall I think that the movie has potential and the first hour on its own would make a great film but the way sex is used simply seems to pander to strights men audience with lesbian sex scenes rather than being an actual movie.",

The crippled narrative is not relieved by always resorting to clumsily-filmed dancing to distract from the lack of pace, and while I'm seldom on the same page as radical feminist criticism, I may have to agree with their objections to the attempts to do an entire Lesbian Kama Sutra.

Almost every emotion the face can show is expressed by the leading actress: longing, satisfaction, shame, allure, hunger, anger, grief, boredom, suspicion. I was worried after the opening scenes that the film was one of stark realism despite its whimsical title. However, after a short time, it took on its poetical style, and in the street, just before Adele sees Emma, we hear the first sound of music. From then on the film is an exercise in cinematic eloquence.\n\nIn one particular scene, Adele wanders into a lesbian club still under the impression of the blue-haired woman she had seen days or weeks before. The club is small and packed and she can't seem to find her bearings. Adele makes it to the back of the club which resembles a dark abyss. She has the look of someone at once desperately searching and giving up the search. Then, behind her, the top of Emma's head appears from somewhere out of the shadows as a looming orb of dark blue. You don't see where Emma comes from; you don't see her face or body, just a color. When Emma sits down at the bar with Adele their first exchange is instantly dynamic and absorbing. If you compare this conversation with the talk Adele engages in with her classmates at the beginning , it's easy to admit that Adele is far more mature, thoughtful, and intellectually eager than her peers.\n\nTo appreciate the subtleties of this scene we have to recall one of the first moments in the film when Adele's teacher asked her class if love at first sight feels like the gaining of something or the losing of something. Is it possible that the director is also trying to answer this question?\n\nThe sex scenes will doubtlessly make some uncomfortable; such authenticity is something rarely seen on screen, but they are neither gratuitous nor pornographic. There's nothing more gratuitous than the old lie that's been told throughout cinematic history of woman as a passive sexual being, and the women in this film are anything but passive.\n\nContrary to other reviews, no single sex scene in Blue is 10 minutes long. There are three sex scenes and together they add up to 10 minutes, but the scene everyone is talking about is at most five minutes, unless the film they showed at Cannes if different from the one making the film festival circuit.",

But the strangest component of this film is the sex; it's apparently received detailed criticism from lesbian audience members for being an inaccurate and almost silly interpretation, but worse than that is how frequently it is used compared to how little it adds to the story. They just seem randomly sprinkled in, as if to make sure that the audience doesn't fall asleep during the film's considerable three hour runtime. \n\nThe structure is there and the performances are solid, but I have little to no idea about some of the creative decisions in this film beyond continuously reinforce that this is an A-list cinematic treatment of a lesbian romance, drowning in self-importance. I didn't stick around to watch the end of the credits, but I can imagine director Abdellatif Kechiche just walking out once the screen goes black, his hand outstretched waiting for someone to put an award in it.

            "content": "Blue is the Warmest Color is a profoundly complex film that follows French teen Ad\u00e8le (Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos) on her path to self-discovery. In it, we witness the kindling of an intensely erotic and emotional relationship between Adele and an older art student, Emma (L\u00e9a Seydoux), and the challenges she encounters in their relationship. First off, this film is fabulously written and directed, and while at first it'll feel a little slow and gratuitous, once you finish the film and think about the themes a little you'll soon realize that every shot and offhand remark in the film actually mattered. Despite that however, the first hour of the movie is just tough to get through, and when rewatching it I always have to resist the urge to skip ahead to interesting bits, and that definitely takes away from the enjoyability of the film. What you will be able to appreciate the whole way through are the fantastic performances by Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos (christ that's a long name) and L\u00e9a Seydoux. This is the first time I've seen Exarchopoulos (let's just call her Ex) on screen, and I have to say I'm immensely impressed at how able she is at portraying such a finely tuned character, and it shows that she's got a lot of emotional range and dedication to her craft. What surprised me even more is that this might be my favourite portrayal of L\u00e9a Seydoux yet, Emma is both energetic and charismatic, capable of passion and regret and so many more emotions than the stone-cold-monotone-chick she regrettably gets typecast as in Hollywood movies. Seeing Seydoux perform in a role like this absolutely reaffirms my beliefs in her abilities as an actress with amazing potential. I do have to note that there are some quite serious controversies about appalling working conditions and a douchebag director, but there is no doubt that these excellent performances helped carry this movie throughout it's lengthy runtime. Yes, this movie is admittedly 3 hours long, but I promise you if you have some patience you will be rewarded for it. If you haven't watched this movie yet, you should definitely make some time for it; Watch it in 90 minute halves if you have to, but I'd recommend a second, and even third viewing of this absolutely masterful film (in writing, direction and performance) to fully embrace it's brilliance.",

It's not because I feel as if sex between women in film is always fetishy, hell, as a lesbian I think shying away from the sexual relationships between women is harmful in its own right. But while I was watching these seemingly out of nowhere scenes, I immediately felt so disappointed. The movie follows Ad\u00e8le, a teenager at the beginning of the film, to which her age stays quite ambiguous at the start of her romantic and sexual relationship with adult Emma, but I digress. Their relationship was interesting to me, as Ad\u00e8le meets Emma at a lesbian bar and sparks start to fill the room. It struck me as destined for failure yet captivating, like a car crash, you just can't look away at the damage that might've not happened, but alas it is too late. The second I felt their relationship start to become merely a sexual fantasy by a straight man, was at that first sex scene. I didn't feel as if the characters were living and breathing that moment, but as if they were doing it to preform. It ruined the illusion of these characters for me. As they are having sex with each other for the first time, they seem to know exactly what to do, which is very unrealistic, and clearly pandering to a specific audience. A sex scene at the very least should say something about the story or the characters. These sex scenes said nothing of value, unless \"getting the audience off\" is valuable, in which case, great that's the only purpose they serve. If the only problem with the movie was that the sex scenes felt staged, I wouldn't have given it such a low rating. The reason why this movie just fell so flat for me, was that after that initial sex scene the characters started to feel like puppets for a lesbian sex fantasy. No growth from the characters at all, Ad\u00e8le felt like a submissive teenager for Emma to be dominant to for the entire film, despite the fact that Ad\u00e8le is actively growing up in this story. This should be a point in her life where she is experiencing the most growth as she matures into an adult and finds what she wants from life. But all she seemingly wants from life is an orgasm, as I just didn't feel her as a person anymore. Same with Emma, as I found myself no longer invested in their lives and was just waiting for the end of the film. My point here is not that straight men can't create/direct stories about women who feel attracted to other women, but that a majority of the time, the women in these stories feel less like actual people, with actual wants, needs, and struggles, and more like sexual objects, whose only want or need or struggle is how fast their going to get laid. That's my rant on this film and if you are reading this and you did enjoy the movie, please don't let me ruin it for you. There were merits to this film, such as the discussion on casual homophobia and the way it dealt with the grief of leaving relationships. Just the way it handled female sexuality, specifically sexuality involving two women, completely left me with disgust.",

Nonetheless, this is an expertly told story that made me virtually every emotion a movie can incite and feels more grounded in reality than other movies in the romance genre. Most people who watch or discuss this movie tend to bring up the film's graphic content. While admittedly I can see these sequences being far too overwhelming for the mainstream audience, I think those sequences add to the realistic nature of the story.

Also, blue is used to symbolize the enlightenment of Adele but then to show her isolation from the world. The movie does an excellent job of explaining the problem of finding one's identity and how you can be isolated from others if you do not embrace it. The lack of a soundtrack is another plus to this movie since the audience can focus on the emotions being unraveled by the characters in the scenes. The only problem with the movie was how they skipped two important plots concerning Adele. First, the storyline of Adele confronting her high school peers about her being in a relationship with Emma. Second, the storyline of Adele coming out to her parents. Those two time periods should not have been glossed over since they were probably influential in shaping Adele's character in the future.",

And the ending is horribly, beautifully unsatisfactory.\n\nI hesitated about giving this five stars before I thought about this review and realised we are probably dealing with a modern masterpiece here.

Ad\u00e8le played by who else, Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos, is interested in falling in love with the collage boy but then finds herself with a blue-haired woman called Emma played by L\u00e9a Seydoux. So those two fall in love, go to the gay bar and have sex. So the whole movie is in French and good thing it has subtitles just so I can know what they're saying otherwise I'll get confused and won't know was going on, so I'll have to look at the subtitles while watching and all is done. Considering the fact that it's three hours long, it is completely worth it. The story is really well written, the actors and actresses who are from France have acted fantastically including L\u00e9a Seydoux and Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos who have great chemistry on screen. And blue is my favourite colour and it is the warmest color. I have never seen in independent film with foreign language is as fantastic as I've ever seen. I gotta say my mum had no idea. I told her that people have to learn different language someday and she says that how can I order a coffee in different language. People! What do you do with them?

Shots go on too long; sex scenes are prurient rather than revealing, showing no more emotional depth than a clever editor could have shown in a quarter of the time.  Scenes of dialogue establish characters over and over on the same territory without deepening our understanding of them.  References to literature border on the pretentious: well-read people will know why the books and writers get mentioned, but it's a little too arch for my taste to name drop Sartre in the middle of a movie, like an intellectual product-placement.\n\nMost importantly, it dabbles in the social politics of lesbianism just enough to raise the question of whether it intends to grapple with those politics.  (It doesn't, conspicuously or originally.)\n\nAgainst all that must be set the lead actresses, both of whom find unexpected nuance and truth in their performances.  They are not presented as \"lesbian types,\" and this saves the film from being boringly polemical.  It's primarily a love story whose protagonists happen to check the \"L\" box.  It seems them as people with complex and interesting selves, not merely complex and interesting sexuality.   This makes it worth watching.",

But it does remind me of one of those good old seventies films that gently unfolds rather than is overtly directed - how they were before films went all corporate. It's a snapshot of the life of Ad\u00e9le, during that fertive period of graduating and starting a career; gradually discovering who she is and what her place in the world, her supple young mind getting to grips with ideas of art, literature,philosophy and, indeed, politics - and there are some inspirational  gems presented here in a charmingly understated fashion, that makes the easy, natural conversation the film contains quite fascinating. Midst it all she is discovering who her real friends are, what her own values and how to cut free and follow them, and her own sexuality. She learns one of life's hardest lessons - she gets her heart broke.\n\nNow, she didn't become the youngest person ever to win the Cannes Film Festival 'Palme d'Or' award (and 37 other nominations) purely for her willingness to bare everything - and I do mean EVERYTHING!- but the break up scene with her lesbian lover is gut-wrenching, raw, intense stuff. You feel her pain. An incredible performance, it's like it's happening for real right before your eyes, a lightning bolt caught on camera.\n\nThree hours is normally a tad long for me, and if they had cut the sex scenes it would have been a more normal length film - that's how much bare-ass, steamy, getting it on there is in this film! It's French after all. But it all does set the scene for just how deeply Ad\u00e8le falls for this, her first, love. That's my excuse anyway. She's also fit as. Just sayin.\n\nNo CGI, no intricate plot, no panoramic camera work, but a story that feels real and a performance of unbridled raw emotion. Can't recommend this film enough.",

Much like The Spectacular Now, released a year later, it doesn't fill itself with platitudes or clobber you over the head with overbearing introspection, it just tells a love story. The characters meet, become attracted, face difficulties and discover things about love they would never have known before. The 2 leads are incredible. Newcomer Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos lights up the screen with her smile and dampens it with her tears, and L\u00e9a Seydoux exudes a level of confident energy that makes it easy to see what our heroine sees in her. It might run a bit long, and would benefit from having 20-30 minutes cut from it, but almost all of what's on screen is golden. It's one of the most passionate love stories ever told, and while the sex scenes might be considered excessive and exploitative, they're driven by sheer animalistic desire and both actresses give it their all. They do an effortless job of convincing us that their characters are deeply in love, and the journey they take keeps us engaged all the way. The truth is the characters are fairly simple, it's the emotions they experience which make it so interesting, and it's what drives the intrigue and conflict. Symbolism is ever-present, especially the appearance of the colour blue, and it's easy to see what themes or emotions they're helping to reinforce. It could be shorter, it could be more concise, but in story telling terms it's a beautiful picture, aesthetically and spiritually, and the love the women share will stay with you long after the credits have rolled.",

Despite the controversies with the director, who was seemingly very hard to work with, the final product was fine, although it could have been shorter, that's for sure. L\u00e9a Seydoux and Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos could have been nominated for an Oscar, but unfortunately there were problems with release dates.

It doesn't rely on typical movie drama or events to drive itself forward, but instead has us see everything through its protagonist's eyes, and lets us feel how she feels and want what she wants. The performances are the most real I've seen, probably ever. And the lack of a musical score was a clever and ultimately beneficial choice. The sex scenes are very long and very plentiful, and I don't like the film any less because of them, but there came (pun intended x2) a point where I don't think anything was being gained from them, in terms of story or emotion. Seeing a lack of filter or censor added to the realism at first, but eventually it more or less felt like it was being naughty for the sake of being naughty. \"Blue is the Warmest Color\" is a film I really do want to watch again, and there's something uniquely special about it. I know there was quite a bit of drama behind-the-scenes, as it's been mentioned in almost every media report I've read about the film. And while I feel bad that this is the case, I do think a great movie came out of the relentless perfectionism the director is said to have had.",

The story of a coming-of-age teenager finding and failing her first love (because of the difference in the social rank, life experience, artistic taste, or whatever weak reason the movie comes up with) is all but too old as a piece of stale cheese. Were it not for the lesbian twist, the story by itself stands no higher than any typical romantic ANIME that Japanese cranks out dozens of times every year. I would even consider You've Got Mails, Serendipity, and many other Hollywood style love dramas, blockbuster or not, way more entertaining.\n\nThe movie could've spent more time on developing the emotional and social struggle the main character goes through with her love journey, and in the process makes her character more relatable to common viewers. Yet the director or the scriptwriter or whoever has their libido unchecked decided to waste the precious time in a film in unnecessary nudity to almost porn-like details. \n\nI get why nudity is important to some love stories, because it's the rawest, most basic yet most powerful expression of love and desire human beings can convey, but an artistic depiction of sex scenes have to serve a purpose integral to the story, not just some eye-candy, or worse, marketing tools, to boost the movie sales by appealing to the audience's crotch. Yet I fail to see any necessity of the nude scenes in this film, except that it makes the motive of the main character more erotic than emotional, another fatal blow to an already weak story.\n\nPlease stop giving this movie high commendation because of your desire to be politically correct. Tagging a movie with sensitive or controversial social elements doesn't guarantee it to be a masterpiece. Quite the opposite, it often conveys the laziness of the movie-makers and lack of creativity. A true proponent of homosexual romance should voice their support through genuine stories of the complicated struggles gays and lesbians face in their life, not riding on the hype of homosexuality in the superficial hope of winning a golden statue. Otherwise, you are not supporting homosexuality, you are simply abusing it for personal gain.",

Namely, that a heterosexual man filmed two heterosexual women for the 10 minutes of screen-time, but basing some scenes off a homosexual woman's graphic novel. While there is no definitive answer of who's gender and who's orientation intersects to create this controversy, I think it's worthwhile remaining inquisitive of why those that hold power continue to tell the stories of marginalised peoples. \nDespite that, some scenes that resonated with me most were in the first half of the film - of teenagers pressuring teenagers to conform to their socially accepted gender roles, and being pressured to understand complex sexual identities, while struggling to fit in through a whole lot of confusion. As always, LGBT films continue to remain on the sidelines of mainstream cinema.

So its only fitting that Something like Blue is the warmest color take place there. One of the most extensive, honest, real romance stories one can see in this decade of the 2010's. Lea Seydoux, and Adele excharpolous bring to life two women who teach each other about love, life and happiness. Director abdellatif Kechiche gives viewers one incredible story.\n\tThe movie begins with Adele as a young teenager who does well in school but doesn't quite know who she truly is. At the same time her sexual desires are flaring at an alarming rate. She tries out a relationship with a guy which doesn't work out but then one day she meets a blue haired girl named emma who changes her life. The movie explores their relationship and all the trials and tribulations that come with it as they both come of age.\n\tKechiche brings to life this story that is raw but done in an honest fashion. Through his writing in this script and his directing, he shows every bit of what makes desire, freedom, love and passion, and heartbreak so important in everyone's lives. he even sprinkles in some philosophy and extensionalism in here to show that's a bit more than just a lesbian romance film. There are so many motifs in here such as Blue, Food, music, and of course sexuality and all its forms.\nadele exharplous performance is incredible! she has this incredibly genuine look of curiosity that she nails everytime. She showcases a true coming of age with her character and takes us on a slow but meaningful journey into the teenage angst and later full grown woman-hood. she is a young French beauty looking to define herself in some kind of way and it was breath taking to see. lea seydoux is outstanding! her acting was subtle but their purpose behind every facial experession the tone of voice and how she provided a unique and colorful aura of mystery to this woman. Blue is an alluring color and she is the embodiment of that here. Like adele she also is looking to have a fulfilling life. The breakup scene is the standout for her here. this is without a doubt seydoux best role of her career so far. \nFor me it was a beautiful display of French culture and why its one of the most romantic places in the world. The film is sexy, and intoxicating at times to watch. despite its 3 hour time limit the director hooks you with excellently timed moments that are crucial to the plot. it remded me of boyhood a bit as we see these ladies go from being girls to women in a methodically paced story. \nits very artsy too especially with all the closeup shots. The scene were adele and emma are together and looking at each other you can paint a distinct picture and can use over a thousand words to describe what they are feeling and iminating towards each other.\nThis ladies and gentlemen is a really solid French picture, one of the best I've ever seen from the country.",

Apparently I'm not alone as Even Spielberg and the jury of Cannes 2013 thought so as well. \n\nThe sex scenes (which were not as \"graphic\" as I thought they'd be based on other reviewers) were necessary in my opinion.  When you give yourself so completely to another, the way Adele gave herself to Emma, and at such a young age, it's no wonder her whole freaking life was wrecked afterward. She was literally ruined for anyone else. This is sometimes the heartbreak of life and love. \n\nI give only 4.5 stars because of the length of the movie.....wow it was way too long with some unnecessary scenes that should have been cut. However, I've heard they had close to 900 hours of footage in the end so three is doing pretty good I suppose. \n\nOverall, as a filmmaker, this movie inspired me immensely.

            "content": "I never write movie reviews, however, I could not just sit idly by while this movie gets so many praises. As a disclaimer, in general, I mostly agree with RT reviews when it comes to movies, especially, when movies actually ARE good (The Godfather, Once Upon A Time in the West, Edge of Tomorrow, Die Hard, Rear Window, etc to name a few from various genres). So I'm not writing this for sake of going against the flow. \n\nThe movie has no real story or plot. Just a movie following the lives of two individuals, mainly Adele the primary character, who becomes attracted to another girl and explores her sexuality. If you're a moviegoer expecting an engrossing compelling story with intense drama, this is not the movie for you. The movie really drags on for 3 hours, and a lot of  scenes really serve no purpose, or at least not in an interesting way. It feels more like a soap opera/documentary in movie format, with some explicit sex scenes. If that is your cup of tea, and a soap opera lover (apparently is the case for all the positive critics on here), then by all means, enjoy this movie.\n\nA lot of reviewers praise the acting, but what acting? The actors/actresses, no offense and safe to say, are practically playing themselves or a version of themselves. The characters are one dimensional, not interesting, and are just your typical everyday teenager/young adult from France. GOOD acting, is method acting (see Marlon Brando, Gary Oldman, Al Pacino, Meryl Streep, Viggo Mortensen, Vincent Cassel (french), hell even most young recent British and American talent in drama movies) and playing characters that are different and outside your comfort zone while doing so convincingly. You're not really acting when all you're doing is playing  yourself. \n\nLast thing, a lot of reviewers praise how beautiful this movie is shot. If by beautiful,you mean shooting the movie in glorious 1080p  with the most up to date camera technology (movie is from 2013), extreme closeups, etc. then sure, it's beautiful. Want beautiful cinematography? See any movie from Sergio Leone (50s-60s era), Stanley Kubrick, Francis Ford Coppola, Alfonso Cuaron. TV shows like House of Cards have beautiful cinematography (with better acting and story to boot) that rival or improve on this movie in every aspect.\n\nSorry if this review comes off negative nancyish. However, the movie was just not enjoyable and quite frankly boring. It was hard to sit through the second half of the movie, when it was: more of the same, but for another hour and a half.\nMy 2 cents.",

I was nervous about watching it and my best friend was surprised that I was even going to do this. So when I first watched it, I actually loved it and was quite something that was different to me. I actually would've typed the review for it, but I was nervous about it and just wussed out. After watching My Summer of Love and typed that out, I started to man up and try to watch the film again whenever I get the time for it as it had been a while, and review it. Even if I didn't finish it, I'll still get enough information to make a review. So after all that, Blue is the Warmest Color is a fantastic romance that is definitely the way to make a good romance that is drama. Lea Seydoux and Adele Exarchopoulos are excellent and their chemistry is very realistic and interesting. When I first saw that it was 3 hours long, o was surprised and was worried that the movie could've stretched it too much, but it went by fast as the movie got me invested and I wouldn't think that it was long. The writing is very well done, and there are some moments that were unexpected, which made me learn more about it. The characters are very three-dimensional and are also memorable. Blue is the Warmest Color is a clever film that doesn't run out of strings and goes in the realistic approach.",

Going into this movie I was a little intimidated by the fact that it was three hours long, let alone the fact that it is in French! However, I quickly got past that.\nIt is a beautiful story. There may be too much sex for my taste, but I can't complain when the story was so beautifully portrayed. It was heartbreaking to say the least. I think one of the things I enjoyed the most though was the length. Yes, the three hours was intimidating at first, and it did move slowly, but I enjoyed that. All the shots seemed to linger too long or not long enough. Yet the whole movie ran slow enough for you to feel like you were living life alongside Adele and Emma and not just watching it. The length of the movie was necessary to keep up the natural progression.\nAlso that ending was so heartbreaking. The last half hour alone was a roller coaster, but the last two minutes specifically left me almost angry there wasn't more. Of all the places to end the movie... Anyway, I wouldn't recommend this movie if you are under 18, but otherwise I'd recommend anyone to give it a watch. It is raw, but beautiful. And don't let the length or language hold you back. Ten minutes in and you are already used to reading subtitles.",

            "content": "I have yet to see a movie as honest in its romance as \"Blue Is The Warmest Color,\" a modern-day arthouse masterpiece likely to change the way the unruly cinematic landscape looks decades after its release.  The winner of 2013's Palme d'Or, it is the kind of film that lands not with a thud but with a bang, a controversial tour-de-force likely to be considered a \"great\" in future generations, like the way we look at \"Day for Night\" or \"That Obscure Object of Desire\" now.  Here is a coming-of-age film that depicts every scar on the mind and the body of its leading actress - an \"event\" doesn't designate her transition from childhood to adulthood but the existence of a long lasting first love, a first serious relationship. \n\tHer name is Ad\u00e8le (Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos, giving one of the greatest performances of the 2010s), who, as the film opens, is a fifteen-year-old desperate for love but also in the painful throes of questioning her sexuality.  Her friends, gossipy and immature, talk about boys as if they're the only conversational topic to exist; Ad\u00e8le cannot help but daydream through their monotonous tell-alls.  While part of her carries a passion for the opposite sex, something in her budding carnality suggests otherwise.  She has a brief fling with an affectionate schoolmate, but after passing an ethereally beautiful blue-haired young woman (L\u00e9a Seydoux) on the street, she realizes that her desires are targeted in the direction of the female gender.\n\tAfter much contemplation, she decides to make her curiosities a reality by visiting a lesbian bar, where the very same azure-maned woman, Emma, is coincidentally also attending.  Seeing her alone and looking hopelessly lost, the latter gently begins conversation, which, in turn, spirals into a torrid affair that acts as Ad\u00e8le's very first real relationship.  The union lasts years, and, as \"Blue Is The Warmest Color\" is three-hours in length, we see every aspect of their romance, warts, euphorias, and all.\n\tAnd when I say we see everything, I mean everything.  The biggest conversation point regarding the film has to do with its graphic, lengthy sex scenes, which are extremely provocative and, depending on who you ask, extremely exploitative.  \"Blue Is The Warmest Color\" is one of my favorite cinematic experiences of the past year, but I cannot give Abdellatif Kechiche a hall pass, despite his mostly brilliant direction - he gets much too carried away, as if he realized just how much control he had over these two breathtaking actresses and figured that making a quasi-porno for himself would be a crime easy to get away with.  \n\tBut as \"Blue Is The Warmest Color\" is epic in length, the sex scenes, a combination of wildly uncomfortable and wildly titillating, do not much hinder the overall experience of the film: voyeuristic and all too real.  We feel as though we're experiencing first love ourselves, deliriously happy during its best moments and embarrassingly pressed to shed tears during its worst.  Kechiche's excellent decision to photograph the film mostly in close-ups only adds to the intimacy we feel toward Ad\u00e8le and Emma; we experience \"Blue Is The Warmest Color\" through them.  It is one of the few films where we feel as though the actresses are controlling its success, not the director.\n\tExarchopoulos and Seydoux give two of the finest performances of the past ten years.  Never have I seen a relationship portrayed with such passion, such rawness - their initial meet-cute, as well as their climactic, sensationally acted break-up, are more convincing than anything I've ever witnessed in film.  We feel the love Ad\u00e8le has for Emma, and vice versa, both thoroughly different yet three-dimensionally portrayed.  They are actresses that only come along every once in a while, blowing our minds away as they remain magnetic in a Monica Vitti sort of way.  The fact that this is the first leading film role for the overwhelmingly talented Exarchopoulos is astonishing - at 20, she bears more nuance than actresses double her age.\n\tBy the film's end, \"Blue Is The Warmest Color\" will leave you emotionally stunted, so severely knocked off your feet that it wouldn't be much of a surprise if you find your feet in a theater fifty miles away.  Films as wonderful as this come but once in a lifetime - it is a game-changer, an earth-shatterer.",

            "content": "Forget, for a moment, that \"Blue is the Warmest Colour\" is the story about two women in love.  Here is a movie so universal in its themes and so broad in its emotions that it could really be about people of any gender, race or sexual orientation.  While Hollywood films simply prattle on about love while merely copying sitcom nonsense, here is a French film that will mean something to anyone who has ever had the pleasure and the pain of being in love.\n\n\"Blue is the Warmest Colour\" was the winner of Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival last May, and has been the center of media attention due to a pair of scenes depicting the two female lovers engaged in graphic sex that has - how does one put this nicely? - a very French sensibility.  It is true.  We see the lovers naked, laid bare with little to hide, particularly during the first of two encounters, an eye-opening seven-minute scene of raw sexuality in which the bodies twist this way and that in a manner that might make some viewers uncomfortable.  Yet, while those scenes are striking, it is the film that surrounds these two women that captures our imagination.  For all the news of scenes of sweaty sexual fumblings, the most tantalizing organ on display is the human heart.\n\nBased on a graphic novel by Julie Morah, \"Blue is the Warmest Colour\" tells the story of Ad\u00e8le and Emma, two intelligent and heartfelt people who, through simple cosmic fate, fall desperately in love.  The movie sees their relationship over the course of a decade, mostly through the eyes of Ad\u00e8le, a pretty 17 year-old high school girl with pouty lips and an expression that suggests a great deal of unhappiness.  She's that very rare teenager who always seems to be waiting for something.  Her classmates live in the moment, but Ad\u00e8le seems to be searching for some kind of meaning in her life.  As the film opens, her eyes suggest that she is lost in the world.  When the movie is over she will have the same look in her eyes, but for a completely different reason.\n\nAt school, she has a circle of friends but they seem distant somehow.  She tries to touch the social strata but nothing really engages her.  She begins dating a nice guy named Samir.  They talk and before long she shares his bed.  Something in her eyes in their post-sexual encounter seems sad.  The parts are there but, in her mind, there seems to be a sexual component that is missing here.  The relationship doesn't last long and she breaks his heart.\n\nThen something happens.  While walking with her friends one day, she passes a blue-haired girl on the street walking the other way.  It is only a passing glance but, for Ad\u00e8le, it leaves a startling impression.  This parting glace stays on her mind for days and days until one night, while out with friends, she makes an unexpected left turn into a gay bar hoping the find the girl.  She does, and they begin to talk.  The girl is Emma, a pretty college student who is studying art.  Emma and Ad\u00e8le talk a lot.  They talk about art, about music, about philosophy, about themselves.  They talk about their dreams.  Ad\u00e8le reveals that she wants to be an elementary school teacher; Emma wants to be an artist.  Days later, on a park bench, they pause in their conversation and share a kiss.  They go home and have sex.  Afterwards they talk some more.  Ad\u00e8le finds her life turned around, especially by her former friends who cruelly interrogate her for hanging around with a lesbian - a reminder that even as open as we are about homosexuality, a social stigma still exists.\n\nWhat is happening between Emma and Ad\u00e8le is a building relationship that will last for several years.  The miraculous thing is that the story is constructed in such a realistic way that we never know where it is going.  Director Abdellatif Kechiche shoots the film in a way that makes us feel as if we are standing in the room with the characters.  There are no glossy, pretty images.  When they sit at dinner, we are sitting at the table with them.  Kechine gets in close, and allows us to get to know the characters intimately.  He is an expert at photographing the landscape of the human face in close-up so that every emotional tic is on display.  We come to care about the fate of these two girls and it pays off in the film's climax, a heart-rending moment that will break your heart as the lovers realize what their fate must be.  The weight of that moment stands for the fate of all lovers in crisis.  What they do with that moment determines the destinies for both.\n\nTo understand what a remarkable achievement this film is, you have to see it in relation to most other movie love stories.  Other films want to throw problems at the characters that are there to be solved.  The problems for Ad\u00e8le and Emma are borne out of their personalities.  Not one moment in this film feels phony or contrived.  It moves with the rhythms of real life and ends on a welcomed, life-goes-on note that leaves us with something to talk about afterwards.  This is one of the best films of the year.",

It is the kind of movie only the French know how to make - real, raw, unapologetic without any gimmicks or manipulation and so brilliantly acted, I really want to know where these actors get their training.\n\nBoth female leads are phenomenal, but Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos is a revelation. I have never seen an actor, male or female, being able to express so much with so few words. The girl is brilliant. I want to find everything she's been in and binge-watch her act.\n\nI was reminded today why I so revere French cinema. No one makes better films about virtually nothing more than the characters' experiences and their innermost thoughts and turmoil. I can go on all night about the merits of this beautiful, heartbreaking film. \n\nJust an FYI if anyone decides they want to see it - the film has several rather lengthy and thoroughly explicit lesbian sex scenes (I've seen my fair share of European films, but never anything like it).

She can't create normal hetero-relationship with Thomas, then develops homosexual feelings with Emma. Emma as an artist, is a free-thinker and open-minded person only for one mistake rejects her. May be, Kechiche that's why chose the name 'Adele' (means \"justice\" in arabic).\nAdele is having sexual fluctuations, her Kinsey scale changes continuously and no one understands her, even Emma threw her away. Emma's behaviour turns out in cafe scene with Adele which I consider great scene of the movie, because we know that Emma also yearns for, but is now having relationship with other woman and can't do anything towards this barrier.\nAdele says that everything settled between her and Emma, that they're in peace. But Adele's destiny is unclouded and even at the end she still alone and 'lousy' (as hopeless), which it is Emma as being 'lousy' (being bad) actually.",

But work it does.\n\nAdele is just entering adulthood when she meets the green-haired proud dyke, Emma. This is a beautiful, bold and highly erotic study of sexuality and love. \n\nThe sexuality goes well past the restrictions of the American R-Rating. But it is essential that the sex and sensuality be graphically depicted. At it's core this is a story of obsession, passion and love which is almost too closely attached to sex. As the two young women grow into full adulthood, each wants more and different things. It is not even entirely clear if Adele is \"lesbian\" as we seem to want to apply it. She loves Emma and all of the pleasure she gives her. But despite her protestations, it seems that something is missing for both women. \n\nBeautifully shot and exceptionally well acted. The film is about realistic as any film can hope to be. Nothing happens beyond the realm of the banal. \n\nThe two lovers come to a point in their relationship that all of us have experienced in our 20's -- straight or gay. Sometimes what we think is \"love\" is something altogether different. Or is it? \n\nThe film offers a restraint romanticism. It is tinged with bittersweet nostalgia and humanity. \n\nSince the film's release both actors have expressed concerns that  Abdel Kechiche manipulated and exploited them. I suppose this is possible, but it smells more like fear of taking ownership of full-on sexual performances. Nothing ever \"feels\" uncomfortable or exploitive. \n\nThis is a beautiful film about human need and the changes that come with growing into our individual selves.",

L\u00e9a Seydoux was 26 years old and Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos was 18 years old respectively when the movie was shot. Ad\u00e8le's performance competes to performance of the French big star L\u00e9a Seydoux.\nDirector Abdel Kechiche repeats hundreds of takes searching for reality. The two actresses are allowed to read the script only once and they were expected to improvise. No makeup artist was available and they played almost without makeup. They told that they could produce reality by being pushed hard and struggling in their performance. The accumulated shooting time was as much as 800 hours and took 5 month, three months more than the planned two months.\nDetailed depiction is apparent in Ad\u00e8le's fight scenes with classmates and her girl friend. Length of these scenes are more than twice of the common movies and they are spectacular with heated performances.\nAd\u00e8le Exarchopoulos looks like a naive girl in the beginning but audiences are soon surprised at her bold performance of sex. However it is not right to see the movie as a pornography by movie stars but it portrays a growing girl vividly. Director Abdel Kechiche found Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos has habits, like playing with her hair, which are observed in growing girls or incomplete women and introduced them into the main character.\nIn addition, Ad\u00e8le's eating and sleeping scenes between shooting intervals are aggressively used so that name of main charter was changed from Cl\u00e9mentine to Ad\u00e8le, the actress's name which also became a part of the movie title.There are many scenes in which Ad\u00e8le eats something including she eats while crying. These scenes are important as Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos tells she got the role because of her way of eating. These scenes gives strong impressions of vitality which the 18-year-old girl has.\nShe eats even while crying. She jumps into homosexual love as soon as she found she loves her girl friend. She fights against classmates who discriminate. She attends demonstrations. She cries and resist when breakup with her girl friend. All of these are outburst of her vitality which competes to one-year-long characterization of L\u00e9a Seydoux with Director Abdel Kechiche.\nI see the real strength of the French movies. I also look forward to \nAd\u00e8le Exarchopoulos's future as an actress though she was lucky to be directed nicely.",

Now one of the actress Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos that I never seen before in anything until this and I got to say that she is a actress I would like to see in more roles showing off her talent. I have seen L\u00e9a Seydoux before in movies like Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol, Midnight in Paris, The Grand Budapest Hotel and Inglorious Bastards, and just like I said about Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos I would like to see L\u00e9a Seydoux in more movie and well she is going to be in Spectre so there's that.\n\nThe director of the movie Abdellatif Kechiche directs this movie so incredibly well and so magnificent that he understood teenagers today how they really act. It wasn't like Hollywood movies that normally get it totally wrong and have no clue on what teenagers are like today because Hollywood are just a studio with their heads up their own ass and have no clue on reality, then comes this movie that's not from a big Hollywood studio but from a different country and a different director who actually have touch of reality on it's characters and how young people discovering their sexuality, and that's why Abdellatif Kechiche pretty much made this movie work.\n\nNow I hear a lot of people saying that this movie is basically porn with the two lesbian and them having...you know what I'm talking about. Now here's the thing porn is basically not real and what I mean is that the actors are getting paid to do they business and the whole meaning of porn is to watch these people who probably don't know each other or don't really like each that much but they have sex anyway and after the video is done they get paid and off they go. Blue is the Warmest Color dose have sex scenes that you would find on PornHub if I have to be honest but it's more than just, the movie brilliantly shows a relationship, a break up, how much they love each other or do they love each other. It's things like this that isn't rocket science to work out and some people are making false arguments over pointless things in movies, some people are so stupid sometimes.\n\nThe writing was realistic and brilliant, the movie is 3 hours long and it flew by me just like that.\n\nNow for problems: I haven't got that much to say when it comes to problems but if I have to really think of the things that I didn't like is that there are some scenes that I felt didn't really belong there and felt a bit fill, and that's it for problems, you see how small my problem was.\n\nBlue is the Warmest Color may not be a easy watch for some people but it shows a realistic look on sexuality and young people today that I think is what makes this movie great from start till the very end.",

At times I felt as though Emma was using Adele, callously hurting her while turning a blind eye - not really the close loving relationship that I was hoping to find.\n\nBesides the unappealing nature of the relationship (in my opinion), the movie was also waaaay too long and just kept plodding on with unnecessarily drawn-out, unedited scenes. I felt like half the movie took place inside a classroom, a dance club or a domestic location (inside a living room or bed room) with us the viewers just blankly observing since nothing much is ever happening. It was also one of the quietest movies I've ever watched, with NO music, no sound effects and hardly any dialogue that reaches above a mild conversational tone.\n\nStill, it was an insightful look into a unique kind of relationship, and I enjoyed it in many respects. Some of the relationship scenes were among the most powerful and believable I've seen in a movie, and the movie certainly left a deep impression upon my emotional memory.\n\nBottom line: If they'd made the two characters a bit more likeable and cut out about half the movie (come on, it's over 3 hours! There are a whole smattering of love scenes lasting probably more than five minutes apiece... That's ridiculous.), this would've been a great movie. As it is, it is good but leaves something to be desired.",

I mean, I respect that the director shows a lesbian sex scene after seeing hundreds of heterosexual sex scenes in movies history but come on that just looked like a porno.

She does a wonderful job of being both unsure and youthfully headstrong.  I enjoyed her character being so blase about pretenses and frivolity in the superficial. She is hilarious to watch eat food, Adele ravenously devours meals as if her appetite for sustenance is insatiable. Emma, played by Lea Seydoux, is the slightly older college student who Adele befriends, at first as a confidante and mild mentor, but soon that friendship evolves. Emma is free-spirited and confident without being pretentious or judgmental and Seydoux's character warrants Adele's infatuation.\n\nThe film is raw, the sex scenes enthralling without being gratuitous and what you get essentially from Blue is the Warmest Color is a coming of age lesbian love story.",

But we are not given much insight into their emotions towards each other, other than than long, unrealistic, and over-the-top sex scenes. The sex scenes themselves add to the shock factor and \"controversy\" to the film giving it an edginess that most viewers enjoy. There is no deeper meaning in the plot. It is just the boring story of a couple. There are many side-plots that were introduced, but abandoned leaving me unfulfilled and confused.

Compared to other long movies, Blue holds the length fairly well, but it's easy to look back and see lots of things that could be snipped without impacting anything.\n\nThe movie spans a number of years. The actual timeframe covered is only coyly hinted at, making it hard to truly grasp the  emotional impact.\n\nBut perhaps time doesn't matter. After all, we can plainly see on the screen how the relationship is unfolding and the direction its heading. \n\nHowever, all that aside, the real beauty within Blue is how the director manages to capture the awkward moments in life. There is almost a reverence to the way these snippets are filmed, whether it is Adele's father asking her girlfriend \"if she has a boyfriend\" or the way spaghetti is in no way an elegant food to eat. Or the absurd--yet intimate--way two people grapple at each other while in bed. Maybe the blinks of exhaustion while standing in front of a classroom of kids who aren't writing their lines.\n\nFor someone who is slightly uncomfortable with life, a bit shy, who feels out of sorts with the verbose nature of society, Adele's face acts as a mirror. She reflects those things we feel; the uncertainty of whether that girl likes us, or whether our opinion is being laughed at, or whether what we feel is valid. It's a delightfully nuanced performance and she captivates the screen from the first shot.",

The film is too long at three hours and even though it gives you much more time to get behind the characters, I don't feel every minute of it was needed. The sex scenes are also extremely graphic and I really commend the actresses for being brave enough to participate. The Adele character is super sweet and has a smile that will light up a room, while the exotic Emma acts as a forbidden fruit and the passion flows freely between them. There is a lull in the 2nd act where it becomes a typical relationship-style film with the couple arguing, etc, but it really is a unique piece and I highly stress this is for mature audiences only!",

While at it's narrative best rather entertaining and fundamentally sound at it's worst comes across as a high production adult film. With its pornographic scenes so explicit that it feels more like a Hustler production Blue is the Warmest Color is oddly appealing when the story is taken from the bedroom and set in the streets of France. While I am not a advocate of the homosexual lifestyle Blue is the Warmest Color is the one film dealing with the subject that I didn't feel completely uncomfortable viewing perhaps due to the superb acting and strong narrative voice that focuses more on the human relationship rather than the gay rights movement. However even as good as it was at times it drug and timing in at three hours is something I really only enjoy in an epic action movie like Gladiator or Braveheart.",

The cast is pretty brilliant, especially the focus character played by Exarchopoulos, giving a truthful, dedicated performance to every scene, as the direction and writing blends together making a very believable whole. At about 3 hours long the run time is far too excessive for any love story (I've never seen so much pasta eating before), as ten minutes will pass every so often and very little, or indeed anything will really happen, but certain parts are truly gut-wrenchingly painful owing to the fact that the relationship from the very beginning is utterly credible, which is something not many movies ever really pull off, or even get close. For a select, patient audience this is worth 3 hours of time, but frankly it's pushing it, and I very much doubt I'll watch it again any time soon. Lastly I noticed this got a NC-17 rating in the US for \"explicit sexual content\", while movies featuring rape, torture, brutal violence etc can get away with an R. Utter madness.",

The actresses did just fine, but the problem was in its direction. The first half of the movie seemed relevant. I liked the premise of an adolescent girl struggling with her sexuality and finding herself. The second half, however, was just post-break up melodrama that ran on and on and then ended, leaving me with nothing. And I know I'm not the only one who believes the sex scenes were WAAAAYYYYYY too long, unnecessary, and abundant. If you want to have a single long sequence sex scene to establish a first-time passionate connection, then okay, maybe. But each subsequent sex scene served to basically remind us that they're lesbians who like sex. It's redundant and cheap. There is nothing about a tender human connection that you will establish with a softcore porn scene that an implied foreplay-fade into next morning scene won't. They were hot and all, but decide what you want the film to be and get back to me.",

So I pirated it from a wonderful website called PornHub.com. I was unimpressed. Unlike one of my favorite genre films, Back Door Butt Fuck Sluts Gone Nuts Vol. XXVII, it did not deliver on the \"all anal action,\" \"freaky lesbians playing with their toys,\" and \"hours of eleven-inch strap-on pelvic thrusts,\" like it was advertised to have. In fact, very little of this film featured the \"erotic girl-on-girl action\" that my colleagues stated it did. \n\nAlthough I do like my porn to have a story to it, this porno takes far too long to get around to the actual sex. And when it does, the performers are clearly amateurs. I mean, they don't even use a real vagina! It's a prosthetic! Do I look stupid? I have been watching and reviewing films of this genre ever since I hit puberty, so don't act like I can't tell the difference between a rubber vagina and a real one. Ridiculous. These girls need to get down and dirty if they expect me to pay attention. \n\nThis film is fine overall, but pales in comparison to such classics of the genre as Dyke Hard, When Harry Ate Sally, and Call of Booty: Modern Whorefare. Unlike those masterpieces, this film contains very little graphic strap-on penetration, scissoring, fisting, and hardcore sex of any kind. What a disappointment. Also, what kind of a name is \"Blue is the Warmest Color?\" It should have had a far more inventive title than that. Saturday Night Beaver? Cumming to America? The Lord of the Anal Beads? You guys seriously passed all of these up? \n\nOverall, I give Blue is the Warmest Color 4 out of 10 stars. It's not that bad once you get past how tame it all is, but there's still far too much talking and nearly none of the hardcore sex that films of this genre should have. Prudish movies like this might have been okay for the 1950s, but nowadays, we should expect more.",

But the movie was a fascinating tale of love (lesbian love, but I personally could care less what kind of love).  Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos was every bit as beautiful as I expected and her acting was wonderful.\nFor me, the major negatives were the believability of some parts of the story line.  For example, Adele is attacked by one of her high school class mates after they find out she went to a gay bar and apparently met someone, but the attack occurs in the presence of her openly gay friend and his boyfriend.  \nThe story though, clearly is the story of young love and as another reviewer put it so perfectly, \"love can be exhilarating and devastating\" and in my view, it so often is both.",

Is this their goal, I think so...but it doesn't work, it is painful to watch at times, especially for a 3 hour run time.  The story is deep, touching and too long with a flat ending.  In some ways, this is the best porn I've ever seen, but I didn't really want that.  The story telling is solid, the acting is great and her transformation is clear and believable.  So why don't I like it?  Because i don't relate to the characters, I don't understand why they feel the way they do.  Why does she choose women?  Why does she cheat?  I never have had these feelings and the film doesn't help me find out what these feelings are.  I feel it fails me, or I fail it...",

She has a consistent face of boredom that is unable to bring a spark to the character (although I think Lea Seydoux is wonderfully alive and real). The other part of the blame I put on the director. I am not at all offended by the sexual content of the film, but I do believe he films the sexual desires in a way that does not influence the emotions of the film, primarily becomes he seems obsessed with butt shots.

            "content": "Blue is the Warmest Colour was explained to me by a friend as a 3 hour film featuring a 10 minute lesbian sex scene and one of the women from Inglorious Basterds. As she is a talented actress, that was the selling point for me.\n\nThere is a lot to say about a film like Blue is the Warmest Colour because it's a hell of an experience. I will admit that its length bothered me a bit because especially within the last hour I found that the length had caught up with me. And the effect of the final hour was mostly about coming to terms with things and it went on at a rather more slow pace than the rest of the film, so Blue is the Warmest Colour indeed is a bit of a stretch. But still, it was an exceptional film.\nTo be Frank, Blue is the Warmest Colour is unforgettable because it is raw and honest. It isn't in the slightest bit afraid to tackle real relationships as they transition from experimenting to healthy adult love without skimping on the sexual nature of them. And thanks to the directional skill of Abdellatif Keniche, it goes through its complex story piece by piece without skipping over anything important. It allows viewers to analyse all the elements of its protagonist Adele's life and how they contribute to the making of her as a person and a woman. It explores the complicated theme of identity crisis and love without ever falling into formulaic, predictable or melodramatic territory and in the process manages to educate viewers and truly stimulate thoughts within them. Blue is the Warmest Colour has a big story to tell and respects its viewers enough to tell it without lying about the truth in its relationships and the importance of the sexual nature of them. I learned a lot about love from Blue is the Warmest Colour, more than I could learn from most romantic films. I learned so much that it was nearly overwhelming to take in. I walked away from Blue is the Warmest Colour mesmerised by all the love within the film and put into making it, and it reminds us just what real films are all about.\nBlue is the Warmest Colour is a visually striking film. It's cinematography and scenery is beautiful, but most importantly it captures the true beauty of the human form. The camera is constantly focused on the faces of the actors, when they are thinking and when they are eating. Every movement of the actors is artistic, and director Abdellatif Keniche knows this and plays it to the film's benefit. The cinematography is always either still or panning along nicely, and when it pans actors the bodies of its two lead actresses we pick up on every beautiful quality of them. Their smiles, their eyes, their skin. Blue is the Warmest Colour features the cinematography usually reserved for an erotic film, and it is used so perfectly that it elevates the style of the film above simple erotic cinema or pornography. The visual style of Blue is the Warmest Colour is unforgettable.\nSome of the finest scenes are the ones involving sexual activity. They capture the true face of pleasure on both actors involved, and they skin across the beauty of the form if each person. Most of the time, both figures are women. And in the style of the artwork within the film which is largely focused on the beauty of the female form within the movie, Blue is the Warmest Colour conveys why females are considered to be figures of such beauty without objectifying them by putting excessive emphasis on them it genitals as a pornography would. The beauty of the female human form has never been captured as perfectly on film as it is in Blue is the Warmest Colour, and the work of cinematography master Sofian El Fani is unforgettable.\nThe symbolism is also excellent. The title of the film gave me an inkling too keep an eye out for the colour blue, and in actuality the colour has never been more vibrant on the cinematic screen than in was in Blue is the Warmest Colour. It was so energetic everywhere, and while blue was around everything felt, as the title would suggest, warm. The colour begins to decrease in the second half of the film as the dramatic aspects become more and more negative, and the film ends on a note of only one frame of blue in sight. The atmosphere of the film is determined by many things, but one things that surprisingly perfects it with symbolism is through its use of the colour blue. The symbolism in Blue is the Warmest colour is exceptional and very surprising, and it makes the film more of a visual treat than it already was.\nBlue is the Warmest Colour is packed to the brim with unforgettable imagery, and that is one of the things that makes it beautiful. But it is also unforgettable due to the skill of the cast.\n\nQuite frankly, the lead performance of Adele Exarchopulos is one of the most ambitious female performances I have ever seen in my life. Adele Exarchopulos proves herself to be an absolutely fearless actress and gives one of the best female performances I have ever seen in the history of cinema. As the lead actress who has to carry the film through 179 minutes, she is the source of the importance in the story as it revolves all around her. But by establishing herself as one of this generation's next great actresses she carries it all the way to the end, not afraid to let loose her emotions from within or show off her body. Adele Exatchopulos gives a performance so real and so open that she hides nothing, and that creates a feeling that suggests Blue is the Warmest Colour isn't even a film. She makes it perfectly real with the brutal honesty of her lead performance which audiences are likely to find themselves so connected to that they are empathising for her and feeling what she is. She makes Blue is the Warmest Colour a great three hour experience, and she is a thoroughly beautiful and talented actress. Her performance and appearance is like a mix of Lauren Ambrose in Six Feet Under and Mary Elizabeth Winstead in Scott Pilgrim vs. The World. By that I mean that her character Adele has a youthful energy which is also burdened by her own uncertainties and insecurities. There is a lot to learn from Blue is the Warmest Colour, and Adele Exarchopulos teaches us most of it without even saying much. A lot of the time it is just her alone and yet her emotions are expressed visually perfectly.\nHer performance is followed closely by the immense talents of Lea Seydoux whose performance is one where she holds nothing back. It is easy to tell that Emma is a character with a lot of love in her, and as the story grows more and more, so does she. You can see the dramatic aspects of her character gradually becoming more and more predominant as the story develops until the dramatic climax of the film takes place, and the whole time she has a grip over audiences. Lea Seydoux is an excellent lead alongside Adele Exatchopulos and she is both very sexy and very sweet, and audiences are likely to fall in love with her the same way Adele does. Lea Seydoux is another powerful cast member in Blue is the Warmest Colour, and her chemistry with Adele Exartchopulos is packed with a lot of genuine emotion which is essentially a shock to see because of how powerfully honest it is. The love they share has got to be real to some extent in real life, because it is actually that good.\n\nSo Blue is the Warmest Colour is long and somewhat slow, but it is a beautiful romantic film which is full of amazing acting and an unforgettable visual style which is likely to leave viewers amazed and educated on the true nature of love and adult relationships, as well as the complications of the female psyche when facing identity crisis.",

As far as the controversy that surrounds the film goes, it really doesn't matter. We're at such a point, where you'd think sexual material, no matter how graphic is no big deal. Obviously there's a lot of people who feel differently, but oh well. This is probably the best film I've ever seen, when it comes down to showing honest emotion, both joy and sadness. A lot of that has to do with the remarkable performance from Adele Exarchopoulos.\u00a0\n\nBlue Is the Warmest Color follows Adele, a bright and beautiful high school student. Her friends are pressuring her to lose her virginity to a senior who has his eyes on her. On her way to a date with him, she sees a blue haired girl and it's love at first sight, only she doesn't really know it yet. The blue haired girl ends up making an appearance in her dreams that night though. She continues to see the boy and does lose her virginity to him, but that only makes her realize that she hasn't truly found what she needs. She ends up running into the blue haired girl again, at a lesbian bar, and learns that her name is Emma. They hit it off and soon start a passionate love affair. From there, it follows their relationship for about the next decade.\n\nThis is a long movie, around three hours, but it sure doesn't feel it. The dialogue is beautiful, as is the camera work, and the movie as a whole. It's about connection, love, and finding ones sexual identity. The beauty of the film is in the relationship between Adele and Emma, and both actresses give phenomenal, honest, and emotional performances. Lea Seydoux, who plays Emma, is tremendous, but like I said before this movie really belongs to Adele.\u00a0\n\nBlue Is the Warmest Color certainly isn't a movie for the close minded or for moviegoers that are turned off by graphic sexual scenes and dialogue. For anyone who can put that aside and look at the movie for what it truly is, a masterpiece and one of the best films about love ever; it's quite the experience. It's a movie that won't leave me. Simply amazing.",

            "content": "\"Blue is the warmest color that you'll ever do...\" Oh hey, that actually fits into a decent rhyme scheme, so you definitely know that I wasn't going to pass up an opportunity to make that reference, as surely as this film doesn't pass up any opportunities to get all artistically audacious and defiant of those pesky censors. Man, you know that there is some creep out there who is getting pumped up about the idea of three explicit hours of teenaged French girls getting together, and I'm going to tell you right now that the creep in question must not watch a whole lot of French cinema. Yeah, for me, this seems to be something else for the Europeans to somehow make boring, and you should know what you're getting into once you see that this film is three hours long and unanimously won the Palme d'Or at Cannes. Well, jeez, this actually sounds like a masterpiece or something, and last year's winner, \"Amour\", stood to be more tedious, with the preceding year's winner, \"The Tree of Life\" actually being pretty good. Huh, well, I suppose Cannes isn't going to just up and give one of the film industry's more prestigious awards to any given \"Holy Motors\" that French snobs excrete, which is good, because if an art film is three hours long, for the lesbians, it better be good. Well, it isn't quite there, but as sure as blue is actually a pretty cold color... or col[u]u[/u]r (Europeans, qu'allez-vous faire?), this film isn't exactly three hours wasted, but boy, it's something of a challenge, for a number of reasons.\r\n\r\nArt dramas of this nature always work to get off the traditional beat and path with storytelling, and at this point, the unconventionality has itself become formulaic, so as if this film's storytelling style isn't bland enough by it's own right, it's yet more of the same-old-same-old, progressing the usual way as an interpretation of a story concept that, for that matter, isn't even all that refreshing, or, well, meaty. In a lot of ways, storytelling tries to be as grounded as it can get, and it tends to succeed a little too thoroughly, even in concept, as the idea behind this arguably overly realist character meditation isn't quite juicy enough to either justify a sprawling length or compensate for other questionable storytelling attributes, presenting grounded characters who and conflicts that it doesn't even spend all that much time fleshing out, until it aggravates you further upon failing to keep consistent even with its ambitious attention to realism. The film stands to go much more over the top with its drama, or at least feels like it does when many of the histrionics go filtered through naturalist storytelling, but make no mistake, histrionics do stand, and are hard to ignore when they break the aforementioned consistencies in realism and shake some of the believability that this film seems to thrive on in so many ways, all for the sake of more flavorful dramatics that don't go as sold as they probably should be by questionable directorial storytelling. Again, what most characterizes this drama is the same thing that characterizes many other very European drama of its type: a naturalist storytelling style, which is effective at times, when not betrayed by the near-distancing familiarity and believability lapses, yet all too often simply bland, discarding musicality and heavily utilizing a sobering atmosphere to try and immerse, only to dull down momentum, which this film cannot afford to lose too much of. Clocking in at just about three hours, this minimalist, either realistic or melodramatic meditative piece is, of course, way too blasted long, and sure, I was pleasantly surprised by how well this film keeps things going throughout its overwhelming length, but, as you can imagine, when filler and material drag, they meander seemingly to no end, bloating a should-be relatively simple script with repetitious excess, made all the more aimless-seeming by the aforementioned lack of momentum to storytelling. Join all of these pacing problems with all of the familiarity and dramatic inconsistencies, and you end up with yet another overblown European art effort, many of which have fallen seriously flat in the past, due to their lacking certain subtle strengths that save this particular effort, yet by no means fulfill full potential. The film ultimately falls as underwhelming, and considering that it asks so much that it's not able to fully prove worthy of, it could have fallen deeper, yet when it's all said and done, decency is maintained in the telling of a story that, to be honest, has more promise than I might lead you to believe.\r\n\r\nDriven by themes of finding yourself as you come of age through a modern, yet thankfully not heavy-handedly presented story of homosexual romance, this film's narrative is intriguing, not simply in its relevance, but in its audacity, conceptually taking a generally realistic approach to compelling subject matter on a minimalist level that limits a potential for juicy scope, but carries a potential for depth whose execution can make or break a film of this type. Abdellatif Kechiche, even as a writer joined by Ghalia Lacroix, carries a lot of pressure on his shoulders when it comes to doing a promising story concept justice, and neither he nor Lacroix can manage all of that weight with the formulaic storytelling, melodramatic bits and, of course, aggressively overdrawn structuring, yet they do what they can with fairly sharp dialogue, in addition to characterization that, despite certain immediate developmental limitations, is rich and tightly handled enough to help in getting you through a hefty runtime, and with only so much flare to its own execution. Minimalist and naturalist, despite a sprawling length, this film does not so much aim to be as stylistically striking as many other European opuses of its nature, but really focuses on storytelling to drive it, and without aesthetic compensation, it runs a tremendous risk of collapsing as misguided and overblown, yet when it's all said and done, the script, while not all that outstanding, is strong enough to play an instrumental role in establishing a certain consistent intrigue that secures the final product shy of mediocrity, yet not without the help of a directorial execution that is perhaps just as inspired, and perhaps just as flawed. Well, perhaps Kechiche's efforts as director aren't so much thoroughly flawed, as much as their thoroughly questionable, intentionally making the classic move of naturalizing its atmosphere, not so much to an ethereal point, but certainly to a chilled point, which dulls momentum down something fierce upon seeing lapses in material that of course, lapses often, and yet, when something actually opens in this minimalist, yet still lengthy drama, Kechiche's naturalism feels genuinely thoughtful, subtly, but surely drawing through all of the dramatic setbacks and drawing in the narrative's core juice with enough realization to compel, even without all of the atmospheric polish of striking visuals and effective score work.There's just enough intrigue to Kechiche's steady storytelling to keep you going, maybe even entertained to some degree or another, and decidedly moved at times, which is good, because outside of that, this film really doesn't have all that much going for it as a minimalist art drama that's even too minimalist to present all that much rich dramatic material, of which there is still enough to be well-handled by the storytellers and, of course, the performers. Perhaps the performances are so much more consistent in their decency than the storytelling because there's so little material for the performers to fumble with, yet if more material was there, I've no doubt that it wouldn't be placed into outstanding performances, at least by leads Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos and L\u00e9a Seydoux, who stand out only on occasion, but never lose their electric and layered chemistry while they, as individuals, convince enough to sell much of this character stud's humanity, particularly when emotional range comes into play. Range isn't exactly a key term to frequently use is descriptions of this film, as it is just way too minimalist and, at the same time, overblown for its own good, but in a film where decency is sensitive, subtle strengths go a long way, and while the final product can never be anything more than merely decent, it has enough conviction to endear, if you're willing to take the challenges it presents as a flawed art drama.\r\n\r\nOnce the color has faded, the natural shortcomings of this minimalist draw go too firmly stressed by formulaic, occasionally melodramatic, consistently dry and exhaustingly overdrawn storytelling for decency to be all that firmly secured, but through genuine conceptual intrigue that is done justice by smart writing, directorial highlights and a pair of worthy lead performances by Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos and L\u00e9a Seydoux, decency is maintained, making \"Blue is the Warmest Col[u]u[/u]r\" (Europeans, que faites-vous encore?) a fairly intriguing, if overblown study on modern love.\r\n\r\n2.5/5 - Fair",

Lea Seydoux killed it in such a great role, but what Adele Exarchopoulos did here is nothing short of spectacular. Adele's journey is so powerful, and this extremely talented actress acted out her every scene brilliantly \u2013 uncomfortable feelings, sadness, infatuation, confusion, shame, heartbreak, regret and so on and so forth. She did it all, and delivered what is truly the performance of the decade. The film is highly emotional in its third act and thematically rich, but unfortunately Abdellatif Kechiche ruined the film and prevented it from reaching true greatness. He directed it through excessive male gaze which resulted in unnecessarily, uncomfortably long sex scenes and a frustratingly apparent objectification of his stars throughout.

In the first 1.5 hour director Abdel Kechiche throws balls to the wall depicting so vividly the intimate moments between two persons in love. I noticed this film had limited release (probably due to its NC-17 rating) and some may find it offensive or uncomfortable to watch due to the explicit intimacy moments which clearly shows not only the chemistry between both stars but their acting was superb! This is a coming of age story, and as one critic pointed out something must be said for a three hour long film that remains consistently engaging. Initially the three hour notice seemed a red flag to me and I really thought it was going to be a bore but I was blown away by the profoundness, honesty, and beauty of this film. Even the nature scenes, the birds singing their lovely melodies, the children in the playground, everything was perfectly executed.  At the 2013 Cannes Film Festival, the film unanimously won the Palme d'Or from the official jury and the FIPRESCI Prize. It is the first film to have the Palme d'Or awarded to both the director and the lead actresses, with Seydoux and Exarchopoulos becoming the only women apart from director Jane Campion to have ever won the award. That speaks volumes about this amazing project written, produced and directed by Kechiche. I agree with ALL the critics lauding this one and ditto to what Tom Clift from Moviedex said: \"\"A tender, at times devastating portrayal of the lifespan of a relationship, one that's as convincing and intimate as any you've ever seen on screen.\" After reading what some of the cast members had to endure while filming this project, I am more in awe and I wish continued success to the cast members!

But at the same time I can say more bad things about it than good (although make no mistake quality beats quantity here, no matter how hard that may be to believe).\n\nFirstly, there's a huge deviation from the theme's in Julie Maroh's graphic novel, which I'm not usually against (I mean hey the Waschowskis did it well enough in V for Vendetta), but it results in some very key moments being cut (readers of the novel will know what I'm talking about). Speaking of getting cut, I'd like to speak on this films length. It's 3 hours long and doesn't need to be. There are entire scenes, entire conversations that can be cut shorter and you will still get the same  product. There's simply too much filler to give me enough of a reason to gleefully sit through a film of this length with NO INTERMISSION. Which would've been nice in the middle (especially given this film's French title denoting chapters).\n\nSpeaking of the middle, the sex scenes. Oh, the sex scenes. I'm usually one to defend scenes like this and to be fair, they're not without their justification, insofar as they are a very explicit metaphor for the couple's passion between each other. But here's the thing. The criticism says they're shot like porn. But I can't even call them porn. Pornography has a serious obsession with the anatomy of the act, and it's intensity. It makes sex look like a dirty sport more than anything else. And yeah these scenes do look like Skinemax at 3 in the morning, but at the same time, the leads (not to insult them, as they are two very beautiful women) aren't exactly Playboy bunnies. It's too real to be called porn and too explicit to be called anything else.\n\nBut at the end of the day, it's still a beautiful film. The acting put me on the edge of tears, the soundtrack (consisting of reggae and what I assume is EDM, although I'm not familiar enough with electronic music to be sure) is impeccable and despite some eurocentricity it's very moving and conveys the action very accurately, and the subtle aesthetic choices of the director really bring this thing together. It's a film that to me is ever so close to being great.",

This is a great film that is honest about relationships and how they are portrayed.  The film is well acted and by that, i mean that this couple really takes over the screen.  L\u00e9a Seydoux and Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos really deserve Oscar nominations for this and they probably would have gotten them if it weren't for this film's controversial lesbian sex scenes.  These scenes work well with the film's raw style of filmmaking, but then they tend keep going on and on which becomes distracting. One of these scenes in particular went on for nearly 10 minutes and it was the only time in the movie that I was checking my watch. This and the run time are the only knit picks I have with the movie.  Even though 3 hours is a long time, especially for a coming of age lesbian romance drama, this movie is an original, raw, well executed, and emotionally satisfying film.",

The story spans the journey of a young 17 year old girl (Adele) as she falls in love with a slightly older woman, their deeply committed relationship, and the agony of the loss of that relationship. It's a deep and powerful coming of age narrative that had me riveted for the three hours of its running time.\n\nThe movie has quite a bit of controversy surrounding it. Firstly, the sex scenes are very explicit and high impact with some questioning whether it needed to go as far as it did. Secondly, the conditions under which the actors were required to work because of the director's approach and demands have raised questions about whether the two young actors were exploited. And, finally, some of the gay community have criticised the film because the actors were not homosexual, suggesting that the movie is little more than a heterosexual's biased vision of what they would like a lesbian relationship to be like.\n\nI saw the movie without knowing about any of these criticisms. In my opinion it's an extraordinary film. The acting, particularly by Adele Exarchopoulos, is incredible. It is a deeply moving exploration, as Robbie Collin puts it, of \"pleasure, sadness, anger, lust and hope.\" A truly remarkable achievement.",

I love the genuine emotions the actresses portray, how natural they were, I could not imagine how hard it must've been to shoot for 5 months, no make-up, no stylist just true, natural emotions. I was amazed considering the fact that most of the time the camera was focused on their face. I was captivated by the story and how believable Adele Exarchopoulos and Lea Seydoux's chemistry worked! Also, I am a new fan of French-Tunisian director Abdellatif Kechiche, the first work of him that I saw was 'Black Venus' (Venus Noir), kudos to him and his amazing actresses, just wow!

            "content": "Holy cow, this was good.  This was possibly the best love story I've ever seen.  It felt totally real and without any pretense - just a frank portrayal of Ad\u00e8le's life, with the most realistic-feeling acting performances I've ever seen.  Apparently the realism came from director Abdellatif Kechiche's brutal directing style, according to this now-infamous Daily Beast interview: http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/09/01/the-stars-of-blue-is-the-warmest-color-on-the-riveting-lesbian-love-sory-and-graphic-sex-scenes.html\n\nWhen I was watching this movie, I felt totally immersed in Ad\u00e8le's life. (The original French title, La Vie d'Ad\u00e8le - Chapitres 1 & 2, translates to \"The Life of Ad\u00e8le - Chapters 1 & 2\", which is a more accurate, if less creative, title.) It was like I, as an audience member, was going through all the motions and experiences Ad\u00e8le was going through as she navigated her coming of age.  During the bar scene (one of the best scenes in the movie), I felt Ad\u00e8le's apprehension when she saw Emma sitting across the room, and then her nervous excitement as she spoke with her for the first time.  During the scene with the first kiss, I could feel the palpable tension and excitement, and I could read the invisible gears churning in Ad\u00e8le's head as she contemplated kissing Emma.  During the sex scenes, I felt like I was the one there getting my brains fucked out (more on that later, since it's such a fun subject to talk about).  During the breakup scene, I felt like I was the one heartbroken, on the floor crying, and feeling like my life was over.\n\nThis love story's beauty comes from it being precisely the opposite of the typical sappy and clich\u00e9-driven love story.  It's honest, realistic, at parts joyous and brutal, and, in the end, tragic.  Many of the classic tragic love stories derive their tragedies from the deaths of one or both partners, but to me breakups are worse than deaths, because with death there's a clean finality, but with breakups both partners are still there and linger, so depressingly bittersweet and tantalizingly out of reach, as we see in Ad\u00e8le's post-Emma life and her awkward relationship with Emma after their time together comes to an end.\n\nAs for the same-sex nature of Ad\u00e8le and Emma's relationship, that element is largely downplayed (aside from a defensive scuffle Ad\u00e8le gets in with her high school friends and her hiding her relationship from her parents).  The movie wisely avoided any real political or cultural statements about homosexuality, and focused instead on the romance and emotions, and that approach paid off by making the story feel amazingly universal.  To me, this movie didn't even feel like a \"gay movie\", just a love story that happened to be about two women.\n\nYeah, it's long, and I could tell that it was almost three hours long while watching it, but for most of the movie, it's not exactly slow; it's just thorough.  It really covers Ad\u00e8le's life from the middle of high school to a number of years (5? 6?) later, and it takes time to build up and fully flesh out her character.  And I appreciate the sort of craftsmanship that went into developing her character, as well as Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos's performance that brought that character to life (I really think she should have at least gotten an Academy Award Best Actress nomination).\n\nThe movie did feel like it was losing momentum around the three-quarters mark, when Emma shed her blue hair coloring - and her warmth and affectionate charm along with it, apparently.  The movie also dragged on anticlimactically after the breakup.\n\nI do agree with other critics that the movie left a lot of loose ends hanging with respect to the other people in Ad\u00e8le's and Emma's lives.  We never see what happened with Emma's previous girlfriend, Sabine, and we don't find out when precisely Emma and Sabine's relationship ended, which is actually somewhat important in light of Ad\u00e8le's later infidelity.\n\nI didn't really like how almost every scene was a close-up of a character's face.  I understand that the director was trying to put the audience in Ad\u00e8le's world by basically shoving us right up into her face, but I personally like being able to see more of what's going on.  It works for some parts of the movie, especially the more emotionally intense scenes, but for other parts it would've been nice to at least have the character's entire head in the shot.\n\nThe first, longest, and most infamous sex scene between Ad\u00e8le and Emma was well-done; it was impulsive, raw and emotional.  I did think it was too abrupt, as the movie jumps from their first kiss right to the sex, but maybe that was the point, that their built-up passion was being torrentially unleashed.  The subsequent sex scenes were weird because they always abruptly followed interesting discussions about Ad\u00e8le's career.  One minute Ad\u00e8le would be talking about how she was going to be a teacher, and then before I knew it she was having passionate sex with Emma, and I would be thinking, \"wait!  I want to keep hearing about your career plans...\"\n\nIn terms of acting, Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos's and L\u00e9a Seydoux's performances were so powerful that they've completely changed my conception of the limits of acting and how indistinguishably realistic a performance can be.  I'm not even sure if I can go back to watching other people's performances now, because the acting in this film was the most realistic and authentic I've ever seen, and everything else will now seem like dramatic fluff in comparison.  These performances were such that I could barely tell they were actually acting; it was almost like I was watching a documentary or a reality show - the most authentic-to-life reality show ever.\n\nI don't think I ever connected to an on-screen couple the way I did with Ad\u00e8le and Emma.  You know how fans will often become stupidly attached to fictional couples - write fanfiction stories about them, post fan videos of them on YouTube, etc.?  I always thought that was lame, until I saw Blue is the Warmest Color.  I don't think I'm a bonafide \"fan\" of Ad\u00e8le and Emma, but if there was ever a cinematic couple I met, became attached to, grew alongside, and rooted for, it was them.\n\nMuch like Spring Breakers, another 2013 movie I really liked, this movie stays with you.  It was on my mind for days afterward.  My life actually feels richer for having seen and experienced this, in no small part because I can personally relate to most of it, especially the rise and fall of a long-term relationship.  But this movie has more to offer beyond its love story centerpiece; it details every aspect of a young woman's professional and personal lives, and infuses her story with the full range of universal human emotions - curiosity, anxiety, excitement, disappointment, joy, sadness, passion, heartbreak, acceptance.  Blue is the Warmest Color might be the most honest and true-to-life on-screen portrayal of not just love, but of human life.",

            "content": "Excellent dissection of ill-fated romance between two young women still needs paring down\n\n*** This review may contain spoilers ***\n\nRating: 3.5 out of 5.0\n\nOkay I'm generalizing, but in so many cases, If you're looking for an intense film about relationships, French films trump American ones, because the French just seem inherently to be the experts when it comes to love and passion. French-Tunisian director Abdellatif Kechiche's intimate dissection of a romance between two young women is no exception. His film won the Palme d'Or, the top award at the Cannes Film Festival. This was the first time a director and two actresses collectively received the award-by a panel led by such film industry luminaries as Steven Spielberg, Nicole Kidman and director Ang Lee. \n\nThe film features a smashing performance by Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos who has the same first name as the film's protagonist. When we first meet Ad\u00e8le, she's a high school student confused about her sexual identity. She sees a young blue haired woman on the streets and has dreams about her. Prodded by her gossipy classmates, she has a brief, unsatisfactory relationship with a boy, but soon breaks up with him after an encounter with a female classmate, who kisses her in the school bathroom. The female classmate tells her that she wasn't serious about the encounter but Ad\u00e8le is taken to a gay bar by a male gay friend but she soon wanders off to a lesbian bar, where she meets the blue-haired woman she had seen out on the streets earlier.\n\nThe young blue-haired woman is Emma (played by an equally intense L\u00e9a Seydoux), an older art graduate student. They begin a steamy affair, culminating in a series of explicit sex scenes which has garnered quite a bit of publicity for the film. The second Act occurs after a passage of time-now Emma is trying to break into the art world as a professional artist and Ad\u00e8le has begun a job as a kindergarten teacher. Director Kechiche pulls out all the stops in depicting the burgeoning romance between the two women. \n\nThe problem with much of it is that it's just too drawn out. That not only includes the sex scenes but other scenes such as when the each women meets one another's parents (Emma's upper middle class parents know that she's gay and are immediately accepting of Ad\u00e8le; but Ad\u00e8le's lower middle-class parents are left in the dark as to the nature of their relationship). Mr. Kechiche can't resist closeups of each character discussing how much they enjoy the pasta they're eating. Another earlier scene, where Emma and Ad\u00e8le engage in a long intellectual discussion about Sartre and other sundry topics on a park bench, also seems to go on and on.\n\nBut I was grudgingly willing to put up with the incredibly drawn out spectacle to see what the final outcome of the relationship was between the two lovers. Before the final blowup, cracks in the facade of the relationship, begin to emerge. Ad\u00e8le, working much more simply with children, begins to feel out of place in Emma's more sophisticated world of art professionals. Finally, with Emma spending more time in the art world, Ad\u00e8le has a brief fling with a guy, an actor in American action movies. Emma finally figures out that Ad\u00e8le has been cheating on her and she flips out. She throws Ad\u00e8le out of her house and tells she never wants to see her again. I like how Emma was depicted in the scene where she dumps Ad\u00e8le, as her lack of flexibility and unwillingness to forgive the vulnerable Ad\u00e8le, showed her to be cold and overly controlling. In other words, there's a multi-dimensionality to the character.\n\nThe rest of the film I would say is anti-climactic. Some years pass and Ad\u00e8le spends a good deal of time by herself, trying to get over her relationship with Emma, but not quite doing so. She finally meets with Emma after quite a bit of time has gone by, who ostensibly has forgiven her. Ad\u00e8le attempts to force herself on Emma in a restaurant but Emma is now committed to another woman and rejects her. Flash forward again- Emma invites Ad\u00e8le to her art exhibition, where Ad\u00e8le finally accepts the fact that Emma has moved on. Her run in with the actor (who's now a real estate agent) doesn't seem to go anywhere.\n\n'Blue' is a three hour movie but it probably could have been more effective with 45 minutes of less footage. I wonder if the sex scenes were pared down, the film would have garnered as much publicity as it did. The end of filming was not the end to the controversy. Not only did union members complain about director Kechiche over working them but Exarchopoulos and Seydoux indicated that they never wanted to work with Kechiche again as they indicated that he treated them roughly while shooting the film.. Seydoux went as far as saying that she felt like a \"prostitute\" during the film shoot. Kechiche was offended by his actors' comments and at one point was quoted as saying that he hoped the film would not be released. There was also talk that Kechiche was going to sue Seydoux for her comments.\n\nProbably both parties overreacted. Exarchopoulos and Seydoux knew what kind of film they were getting into, when they signed the contract to act in it and they probably should have known Kechiche was a perfectionist. On the other hand, Kechiche perhaps should have taken into account his actors' youth and directed them a little more gently.\n\nAll in all, 'Blue is the warmest color', is a well-made film which captures the intensity of the intense relationship between two young women, who ultimately were not right for each other. The film needed to flow better and the editing was just not there. If you're willing to put up with the film's overall length, you will still be rewarded with some phenomenal acting and intense dissection of a relationship that ran its course.",

The cinematography is beautiful, the script good and the score is nice. The direction (which I hear was torturous) brings such a naturalistic approach (apart from said glamourised scenes) that it doesn't feel like your watching a movie but are instead watch a portion of someone's life.

            "content": "I never thought in my wildest dreams that this movie would get so graphic. Ad\u00e8le is in high school, studying literature. After a day of studying a portion of a French novel dealing with love and women and having love pass you by in an instant, Ad\u00e8le passes a couple on the street. One of the pair is a woman with blue hair. The moment strikes Ad\u00e8le immediately. They exchange glances, but she cannot get that blue haired woman out of her thoughts. Ad\u00e8le's exploration into her sexuality and who she is begins that night, when she's taken aback by her dream of that woman. Thoughts start reeling in Ad\u00e8le's mind about who she is. She takes chances with a classmate, trying to steal a kiss in the bathroom, only to have it backfire on her. Ad\u00e8le is lost accompanying one of her friends out to a male gay bar, she follows a group of girls to a lesbian bar. Searching and searching for this woman who will not leave her mind, Ad\u00e8le spots her. Her name is Emma, and she is in college for painting. A friendship eventually develops that becomes so much more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are so many coming of age films out there, but Blue Is The Warmest Color has to be one of the only relatively mainstream ones about a girl finding love in a lesbian relationship. The film is really honest and raw. When Emma shows up at Ad\u00e8le's school and they walk away together, it stirs up some hate towards Ad\u00e8le for hanging out with a quote on quote \"dyke\" and the name calling and threats begin. Ad\u00e8le being who she is, it rolls off her back, and does not deter her from falling in love, Ad\u00e8le is enraptured with Emma, almost to the point of obsession. She lives and breathes Emma with an unhealthy dependence on attention from her. It almost becomes dangerous. Jealousy fuels the fire, leading to some unwise and childish behaviors from Ad\u00e8le. The film has a run time of three hours, but it certainly did not feel like it. While every scene is not necessary for the main story line, each fleshes out the character of Ad\u00e8le fully. We know her insecurities, her dislikes, her dreams, and her goals. Both L\u00e9a Seydoux and Ad\u00e8le are phenomenal. She is mesmerizing, her eyes, her lips, and especially her hair captivated me personally. It takes a lot as an actress to give everything you have to a character, and I believe that both actresses did just that. It is on their faces and they wear they hearts on their sleeves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOkay no review of this film would be complete without mentioning the sex scenes. Blue Is The Warmest Color is rated NC-17 for a reason. These are graphic, long sex scenes, especially the first one. They leave nothing to the imagination, the actresses go for it entirely. I read that they used prosthetic genitalia, and if so, those are really good prostheses. I would recommend not seeing this with your parents or with a conservative friend. I guarantee you that there were a couple of walk outs in the theater. Those scenes are very long (like ten or fifteen minutes long), and I wonder what the motive was???. It certainly does not make the viewers think the characters are more in love. Abdellatif Kechiche may have wanted to push the boundaries o the maximum limit, but it was unnecessary even though I really didn't mind. Even if this were a straight couple having graphic sex for a long period of time, I would still question the director's motives. Aside from the sex scenes, Blue Is The Warmest Color is a complete love story with a beginning, middle, and end. It is also about self-discovery, growing up, and regret. It is a creative take on the love story that takes risks and aims to be a topic of conversation after you have viewed the film.",

So I pirated it from a wonderful website called PornHub.com. I was unimpressed. Unlike one of my favorite genre films, Back Door Butt Fuck Sluts Gone Nuts Vol. XXVII, it did not deliver on the \"all anal action,\" \"freaky lesbians playing with their toys,\" and \"hours of eleven-inch strap-on pelvic thrusts,\" like it was advertised to have. In fact, very little of this film featured the \"erotic girl-on-girl action\" that my colleagues stated it did.\r\n\r\nAlthough I do like my porn to have a story to it, this porno takes far too long to get around to the actual sex. And when it does, the performers are clearly amateurs. I mean, they don't even use a real vagina! It's a prosthetic! Do I look stupid? I have been watching and reviewing films of this genre ever since I hit puberty, so don't act like I can't tell the difference between a rubber vagina and a real one. Ridiculous. These girls need to get down and dirty if they expect me to pay attention.\r\n\r\nThis film is fine overall, but pales in comparison to such classics of the genre as Dyke Hard, When Harry Ate Sally, and Call of Booty: Modern Whorefare. Unlike those masterpieces, this film contains very little graphic strap-on penetration, scissoring, fisting, and hardcore sex of any kind. What a disappointment. Also, what kind of a name is \"Blue is the Warmest Color?\" It should have had a far more inventive title than that. Saturday Night Beaver? Cumming to America? The Lord of the Anal Beads? You guys seriously passed all of these up?\r\n\r\nOverall, I give Blue is the Warmest Color 4 out of 10 stars. It's not that bad once you get past how tame it all is, but there's still far too much talking and nearly none of the hardcore sex that films of this genre should have. Prudish movies like this might have been okay for the 1950s, but nowadays, we should expect more.",

            "content": "Blue is the Warmest Color is one of the most honest relationship movies I have come across in a long time.  Abdel Kechiche gives us a bare to the bone look (literally) of Emma and Adele over three hours of footage.  There's no surprise it already won top prize at Cannes, but aside from the accolades, Blue allows us to feel with the characters through the superb acting of newcomer Exarchopoulos and seasoned unheralded vet Seydoux.  \n\nCertainly, Kechiche takes questionable material with gay/lesbian relationships that are so infrequent in cinema and puts it on the front burner.  However, I'd argue the real story lies in a young girl's uncertainty with herself sexually and emotionally more so than being a label.  \n\nA few minor ticks...the movie was split into two apparent chapters.  The second was significantly better than the first and carried more of the weight emotionally of the film than the first.  The acting was more apparent and demanding in the second chapter, also.  Sexuality was a big part of this story, but a few of the scenes dragged a bit.  There could have been quicker edits with the same material to give more explosion to the feeling of the scene.  No doubt both women are beauties of our time.  \n\nI was also a little unsure of how much time had passed as the story progressed.  There weren't enough easily noticeable cues to help guide me on the timeline of when the story aged from Adele being 15 to 18 to however old she is toward the end.\n\nThis is not a romantic comedy.  It is not a comedy in the slightest.  It's a vivid rolling image of a young girl's life.  A love story.  Exarchopoulos shows incredible promise by warping the emotions of the audience through a simple facial expression or word.  I took a class in college that talked about how relationships move along a path and how most movies get the true sequence wrong.  What Kechiche and these women are able to do is make real life resemble this art of a film.  It won't be for most movie-goers.  In fact, a small fragment of my age group would even be tempted to watch this French subtitled film, but if you have any opportunity to immerse yourself in a flick about realistic propositions, take the time to see this one.",

            "content": "This could be summed up as a light porno with a beautiful story of love, forgiveness, and strength.\n\nThis film is a French coming of age film about a young girl, Adele, in her late teens who meets another girl, Emma, who defines the phrase \"love at first sight\" to her.\n\nThey first made an innocent glance at each other and later met and talked at a lesbian bar.\n\nEmma has blue hair, she is an artist, but she is not the main character of this film, Adele is.\n\nAdele is an aspiring teacher who meets Emma and after they meet and hang out at multiple times, they eventually become insuperable and decide to live together. They make love constantly (I will talk about this more later in the review).\n\nLater in the film, as Emma is getting more involved with her passion for painting and drawing, Adele begins to feel alone and she makes the huge mistake she eventually regrets later of sleeping with another person, this making Emma crazy mad. Emma kicks Adele out of the house and forces her out of her life.\n\nAdele is heartbroken and feels saddened by the whole situation as well as her mistake. Even though she lives with the guilt and cannot stop crying, she continues to work hard at job as a teacher.\n\nThree years pass and Emma agrees to meet with Adele at a restaurant. They talk, share how their lives are going, and they even tread delicate territory; enough to make them pounce on each other, making out. But they stop themselves and with Emma having a family at last, she insists that there could never be anything between them again. But Emma does admit that she will always feel tenderness towards Adele.\n\nThis film is a simple beauty, full of great acting, real looking sex scenes, and beautiful imagery.\n\nAdele Exarchopoulos does an amazing job with her character of Adele. I can tell that she truly taps into the emotion that Adele feels. She also has a very pretty face.\n\nThe sex scenes are something else, not to gross you out. I believe there are about three or four sex scenes between Emma and Adele and they get so close to each other that they might as well be having sex. I never actually saw one girls tongue or lips on or near another girl's vagina in the film, but they might as well have been there. For example, Emma's face was deep into Adele's crotch and I couldn't even see anything but her hair. It was intense as well.\n\nFor the imagery, one scene stood out the most.\n\nWhen Emma was hosting a gathering dinner for her art, there was a dancing scene. Adele was dancing with a guy while Emma was smiling and talking with another girl, which Adele could clearly see. At the same time, an old black and white movie was playing on a big screen at the back of the party behind Adele.\n\nAs Adele could see Emma having a good time with the other girl, the audience could see Adele's jealous yet saddened face. At the same time, the camera would focus first on Adele's face, then switch the focus to the movie being played in the background, bringing focus to the movie's female character and her saddened face. The camera would switch the focus back and forth between Adele and the woman in the movie and her multiple emotion-filled faces that matched Adele's emotions at times while looking at Emma.\n\nThis film is gorgeous and a great love story for today's growing acceptance of gay people.\n\nBlue is the Warmest Color, I give you a 100%.",

For Adele in particular, the movie demands a lot from her role. It explores the sexual identity confusion at the beginning, to the moment when true love appears, the joys and challenges to maintain that relationship, and what comes after that. Adele manages to nail every scene by bringing out a whole spectrum of emotions.\n\nWhether it is a lesbian story or not, in the realm of movies dealing with romance I can easily rank this one as high as the likes of 500 Days of Summer, for the level of depth and honesty. It is definitely far more genuine than the pretentious \"The Kids are All Right\". La vie d'Ad\u00e8le's strength is in the raw emotions so it does not need to rely on philosophical/ intelligent points which may work in some other movies of the same genre, even though the director did raise some food-for-thought, verbally, in certain scenes that were not-so-obvious. The only thing that drags this movie below perfection is I feel there is still a lack of involvement from the side characters (parents, friends circle, ex-lovers) given that it is a 3-hour movie. There is some, but not enough. In a coming-of-age story, influence form the people around the main characters could be important factors to how relationship changes.\n\nAs the Palm d'Or winner, I would be happy if it to win the foreign Oscar, but this failed to top Le Passe (A follow-up of the brilliant A Separation) in my view",

            "content": "Every once in a while, a film will come along that sparks controversy. A LOT of it. And although other films this year, such as The Wolf of Wall Street and 12 Years a Slave have caused some because of their graphic depictions of sex, drug use, slavery, and violence, they represent the smallest fraction of visual insanity that is featured in Blue is the Warmest Color. I have been watching movies semi-professionally for three years now, and over the course of this time I've watched over 700 films. But I can safely say that I've never seen anything quite like this one. Do not let the reviewers fool you-- They aren't prudes, there really is a FUCKLOAD of sex in this movie. But I'm going to try and judge it purely based on its dialogue, use of metaphors, acting, story, and camerawork... and try to ignore the fact that PEOPLE HAVE SEX EVERY FIVE MINUTES-- Okay. I'm calm. I will be as straightforward as I can with this, and attempt not to go totally off the rails over the insanity of what I just saw.\r\n\r\nBlue is the Warmest Color is adapted from a graphic (AND I MEAN GRAPHIC) novel of the same name. This film is French, and given its subject matter, I am already inclined to give it a higher score. France, as you may know, has had some trouble recently regarding gay rights. There have been protests in the street by homophobes who get all butthurt (or as the French say, \"la douleur de la crosse\") over laws allowing gays and lesbians the same rights as straight couples. So this is definitely an important film to see, especially if you are a bigoted fuckhead with the mental capacity of an overripe turnip. Sadly, I doubt that the film will make a big impact on the bigoted fuckheads here in the United States (after all, it's got subtitles, and it's not like bigots can read very well), but it's still an important step forward for France.\r\n\r\nThe film stars Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos as a young girl who, after a chance meeting, falls madly in love with an older lesbian named Emma (L\u00e9a Seydoux) with blue hair. It's never quite clear if Emma makes her realize that she's been a lesbian all along, or if she was so charismatic that she made her \"switch teams,\" so to speak. But either way, she leaves quite an impression on both Ad\u00e8le and the audience. The dialogue between the two feels real to the point where you forget that you are actually watching a movie, which is a very rare thing in ANY kind of movie these days, especially romances. I didn't stop believing what was happening for a second, although during the SEX SCENES, I started to wonder just what it was like to film this thing. According to the two leads, the director of this movie had horrible on-set manners, which probably made these difficult scenes ever harder to film. But even so, it's hard to tell this from the movie, as everything runs very smoothly throughout it.\r\n\r\nBITWC is definitely going to go down in history (unfortunately) as That One NC-17 Lesbian Movie With All the Sex. But it honestly disgusts me that this movie got such a rating. Sure, there is a lot of graphic nudity in this film, but it's not like it was vapid and pointless like the sex in some movies. These two characters were actually in love, so what kind of world do we live in where the natural act of physical love is frowned upon like this, while utterly idiotic movies that are jam-packed with blood and gore squeeze by with a PG-13 rating? God, it sickens me to the core. Yes, this movie was an all-out assault on good taste, and yes, I couldn't lift my jaw back up to my mouth for a good half-hour after seeing it, but nothing in this is going to leave some kind of lasting impression on me that will scar me for life. The ratings system is a form of censorship, and although it's definitely more agreeable than the Motion Picture Production Code, it's still a higher power telling us what we can and can't see. There are no actual written laws about what you can put in a movie today, but movie theaters still turn teenagers away from R-rated film, and many theaters still refuse to play NC-17 films. I hate to give so much attention to the controversy of this film, because it certainly has other merits, but I respect it immensely for not cowtowing to \"good taste\" and right-wing Christian values crap like that. This is an important film to see.\r\n\r\nAlthough there's a lot of people doin' the nasty in this movie (perhaps too much), it should not be categorized this way. No, male reviewers don't only like it for this reason-- It is powerfully acted and visually arresting. The undertones of true love and soul mates are present throughout, and there is a lot of symbolism throughout, ranging from the obvious (when the main characters eat oysters... yeesh) to the more obscure (when Ad\u00e8le swims in the sea, which of course is blue). Looking for these metaphors can take time, but you don't really have to, because the dialogue is just as strong as the visual grandeur of the film. Even the small talk between the characters is absolutely spellbinding. You just don't get great drama like this very much nowadays, and even though it was ridiculously ambitious, it had my attention from beginning to end. Not many three-hour movies have had me totally riveted from the get-go-- In fact, I can think of only two others, Lawrence of Arabia and The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly-- But this had perfect pacing and likable characters, leading to one of the most enjoyable movie experiences of the year. \r\n\r\nFinal Score for Blue is the Warmest Color: 8/10 stars. My problems with this movie are few, but when they are present, they are pretty significant. Although the sex definitely had a \"wow\" factor, it honestly did not need to happen so often. Not being a prude, just saying... repetitious grunting and moaning does not further the plot or provide character development. As it is with any film, I fully support scenes of nudity the same way I support scenes of spontaneous decapitation. But if you're going to put a lot of it in your movie, you should have some reasoning behind it to back it up. And even if there's a lot of it in this, the reasoning is sound. This film is about love and loss, and what people are willing to go through in the name of true love. The main character is likable, the dialogue is fantastic, and the cinematography is utterly spectacular. Minor flaws aside, this is one of the best films of 2013. But would it have killed them to use the song \"Crystal Blue Persuasion\" in it? Damn... missed opportunity.",

What follows is the story of Adele's relationship and life with the blue haired Emma. A torrid and passionate affair filled with tears, drama and some rather extensive sex. The story spans a decade in Adele's life, though the 3 hour runtime never drags. The two female leads are exemplary as Adele and Emma. Adele Exarchopoulos is particularly excellent as Adele. The camera is on her face for most of the film and her aching vulnerability is there for the world to see and empathise with.\nWho knew lesbian drama could be interesting!?",

This is one of the saddest, yet sweetest love stories ever told, and I cannot remember the last time two actors reverberated such an intensely realistic passion for one another.  Everything is believable, and I'm stretched to comprehend how in the hell the actors did it.  This film is a testimony to the real magic of performance, the subtle illusions an actor can create for his/her audience.  As beautifully shot as it is, the actors carry this film the entire three hours.  The on-screen chemistry between Adele Exarchopoulos and Lea Seydoux is elegantly realized and realistically rendered; I couldn't help but sympathize with them both. I wanted to reach out and hug Adele, adopt her as a daughter and take care of her.  Sounds weird, but my heart just went out to this character.  At times the movie is extremely sexual, but these scenes never quite feel gratuitous, but instead serve to illuminate the film's particular ethos: that every moment is a microcosm of meaning and beauty, and while love may not last forever, it's still worth pursuing.",

Those scenes aside, the controversy and a brouhaha surrounding it often makes people overlook the fact that this is a wonderful, beautiful bittersweet story about young love/first love. It's simple enough: A teenage girl's sexuality is awakened as she falls for an older woman. The audience is taken to the journey of their relationship. As I was watching this, I almost forget the fact that it's about two women and I was just taken by a beautifully and intelligently told love story. At almost three hours, is it a bit too long?

It is the first film to have the Palme d'Or awarded to both the director and the lead actresses, with L\u00e9a Seydoux and Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos becoming the only women apart from director Jane Campion to have ever won the award. Some better informed critics were suspecting that this award is just a result of politically organized campaign to legalize same-sex marriage in France regardless the January and March 2013 massive protests against that move which made news worldwide. On May 26, with thousands of people calling for the withdrawal of the now approved law, this movie won the Palme d'Or at the 66th Cannes Festival. I stopped believing in coincidences long time ago!\r\n\r\nThe story of Ad\u00e8le (Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos), a high-school student whose female friends  encourage to go out with a boy who is attracted to her, but soon finds out that one day instantly falls in love with a passing-by woman with blue hair (L\u00e9a Seydoux), was different. Especially because of the very long and dragging sex-scenes which were like from a lesbian soft porn movie manual (if there was such a thing). I cannot say that the director Abdellatif Kechiche didn't do it tastefully as much as possible, but it was still what it is - soft porn! The artistic value of the movie was not positively affected by these scenes at all. Maybe there were there to shock, but they could do that only with the tenth of the length. The underdeveloped characters gave us some interesting situations where we have a young lady who reads a lot but doesn't know what Fine Arts are... or who was Gustav Klimt! I don't want to even mention the bad table manners... The soap opera \"tricks of the trade\" were very well hidden behind the \"shocks of the trade\", and that shows that Abdellatif Kechiche knew what was he doing and managed to fool most of the fans! I am not saying that I am the \"smart one\", but I could not forget the feeling that I am becoming like my mom if I start watching this and enjoying it. But I have to mention that Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos as Ad\u00e8le was worth watching - I didn't care at the end if it's a soap opera or serious drama - she was outstanding young actress which was so believable that you could get the feel that could be a simple documentary. Exarchopoulos described how her auditions with Kechiche over the course of two months consisted improvisation of scenarios, discussions and also of them both sitting in a cafe, without talking, while he quietly observed her. It was later, a day before the New Year, that Kechiche decided to offer Exarchopoulos the leading role in the film, as he said in an interview, \"I chose Ad\u00e8le the minute I saw her. I had taken her for lunch at a brasserie. She ordered lemon tart and when I saw the way she ate it I thought, \"It's her!\"\" The two main actresses, L\u00e9a Seydoux and Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos, didn't think so highly of the director - they both complained about Kechiche's behaviour during the shooting. They described the experience as \"horrible\", and said they would not work with him again.\r\n\r\nIf you want to see some outstanding acting - this should be a good choice... for everything else, your standard daily TV soap opera or \"pornhub\" will do.",

            "content": "On January and March 2013, massive protests against same-sex marriage took the streets of Paris and made news worldwide. On May 18, same-sex marriage was legalized in France, what lead to another big manifestation, on May 26, with thousands of people calling for the withdrawal of the approved law. On that same day, a lesbian film won the Palme d'Or at the 66th Cannes Festival.\n\nThere's no doubt that Blue is the warmest color (La Vie d'Ad\u00e8le - Chapitres 1 et 2) was controversial even before its premi\u00e8re. If at that time I already thought that the Palme d'Or was a political choice - Cannes Jury President Steven Spielberg denies it, of course - after watching Abdellatif Kechiche's film, no doubts are left. The award was followed and celebrated mainly on social networks, with the film being praised by thousands of people who came to watch it only months later. Groupthink, something common within the public, has become also a constant feature within the critic, pretty much unanimous in their praise. It's known that film festivals are not parameter of quality anymore, but it's still expected that a film will be acclaimed for something else besides ideological and political views and long shots of graphic sex and nudity, which, by the way, reminds me of Shame, although Steve McQueen's film has a more interesting background. We must also mention Stranger by the Lake - winner of Cannes 2013's Queer Palm Award and Un Certain Regard (Best Director)-, a film really worthy of polemics, however, innovative and thought-provoking.\n\nBased on Julie Maroh's comic book Le Bleu Est Une Couleur Chaud (Blue is a warm color), that covers the (around) fourteen years since Cl\u00e9mentine (Ad\u00e8le) and Emma meet until the melodramatic final shot, Blue is the warmest color is more like a cheap soap opera praised as masterpiece. While Maroh's comic book focus on coming out, prejudice, doubts and fears, Kechiche insists that he had nothing militant to say about it and was only telling the story of a couple. Maroh actually echoes him saying that none of them had a militantly activist intent, but if you make a book hoping to no longer be insulted, rejected, beaten up, raped and murdered for being gay, you do have a militantly activist intent. Perhaps that was not the film's aim, however, if an absurd but turning point scene from the book was not included, Ad\u00e8le's friends' homophobic reaction, the gay pride scene and the \"lesbian sex for Dummies\" could've also been removed. If such scenes were kept is because homosexuality, albeit quite in vogue, is obviously still not widely accepted, with no place, therefore, to the simplistic speech of \"a couple like any other.\" Or maybe, and I bet all my chips there, given the media coverage received by the film, it's just one more \"lesbian chic product\", because if homosexuality is portrayed in a natural way somehow, the sex scenes are so laughable that one is sure Kechiche made his homework: lots and lots of lesbian porn and corny romance (there were even candles in the room. candles!). It's true that Maroh narrates Cl\u00e9mentine and Emma's first time in five pages, and that's her fault if Kechiche's \"imagination\" goes too far - \"I want to do everything with you. Everything that is possible to be done in a life time\", says Cl\u00e9mentine to Emma - but if in the comic book the scenes are exciting, in the film is the opposite.\n\n\"You don't find it a pain a director explaining it all? When a director makes me over-analyze a scene or a character, showing everything, it closes off my imagination. I don't like it\".\n\nSometimes tender (Donna Deitch's Desert Hearts), sometimes hot (Zero Chou's Spider Lilies), sometimes \"explicit\" (Chantal Akerman's Je tu il elle), cinema's history is filled with beautiful scenes of love and sex between two women. We could claim that a woman understand it better, but let's not forget the terrible The Kids Are All Right, directed by Lisa Cholodenko, and the delicate 80 egunean, written and directed by Jos\u00e9 Mari Goenaga and Jon Gara\u00f1o, not to mention Lukas Moodysson's Fucking \u00c5m\u00e5l, one of the best lesbian coming-of-age films, Lianna, Egym\u00e1sra n\u00e9zve, Bound and so many other lesbian films directed by men. Much has been said about Kechiche's fetishism as something exclusively male, but if today Blue is the Warmest Color is the apple of the eyes and the enfant terrible of the time, three years ago was The Kids Are All Right the one raising warm (for) and exalted (against) criticism. Apparently so distant - a lesbian and a straight director - what brings these two films together is, indeed, the male gaze: a heterosexual and sexist view of the feminine. This discussion, by the way, reminds me of John Cassavetes's explanation for the lack of sex scenes in his work, which films can be considered rather sexist by some people:\n\n\"I'm concerned about the depiction of women on the screen. It has gotten worse than ever. It's related to their being either high- or low-class concubines, and the only question is when or where they will go to bed and with whom and how many. (...) As for showing the sexual act in film, I think that's a lot of balls, phony, exploitative and commercial. It's cheap voyeurism and I think there's too damned much of it now anyway. (...) Playboy magazine, tit films and cocktail-party diatribes have not only affected our society but have shaped it with such discontent regarding men and women that sex is no longer in itself sufficient without violence, death or neurosis as stimulants. I don't think there's aznything morally wrong with seeing a nude body on the screen, but it offends me to watch people kiss without genuine love or passion. Sex on the screen bores me.\"\n\nIt's known that Maroh and so many other lesbians didn't like Kechiche's \"aesthetic approaches\", but for me, not only the \"so-called lesbian sex\" was \"brutal and surgical display, exuberant and cold which turned into porn\", but the whole picture. It's not Ad\u00e8le that is voracious, Kechiche is; voracious, methodical and perfectionist. I can even imagine him shouting: \"Ad\u00e8le, lift that ass up!\" Or, who knows, maybe measuring the lens'angle of view (i.e. Kechiche's thing for rear ends). As perfectly said by sociologist and gay activist Marie-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Bourcier, the girl number of straight porn movies, where two girls go down on each other while waiting for a man to join them, is almost more honest, once the device is clear: a true voyeur shoots for guys. In Kechiche's case, she says , even if his thing is not wide open pussy (very pornovulgus), but nasal mucus and Ad\u00e8le's gaping mouth, the voyeur device is present through its \"cock camera\" eager to close-ups. Indeed, his (oni) presence is so palpable that sometimes we have the impression of watching a m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois not only sexual but also \"intellectual\", with Kechiche always standing out and offering the real pleasure: there are many artistic and literary references - Sartre , Francis Ponge , Choderlos de Laclos and Marivaux , whose novel La Vie de Marianne is a reference to the film's French title - however, Ad\u00e8le's has a shallow depth (deeply shallow would be the right expression, but the photography technique shallow depth of field that consists in isolating \"part of the shot which is nicely in focus while throwing elements in the background - and sometimes the foreground - out of focus and into a lovely blur\" is exactly what Kechiche does in his film).\n\nAlthough Maroh is ok with the fact that Kechiche's heroin has a personality far from hers and thinks that what \"he developed is coherent, justified and fluid\", I think that turning Cl\u00e9mentine into a dull, monosyllabic and vulgar (bad table manners and so on) Ad\u00e8le was his most brutal move. The world is full of bestsellers, alright, but Ad\u00e8le loves to read, likes Kubrick and Scorsese, and doesn't know what Fine Arts are? Not to mention that Gustav Klimt and Egon Schiele are not Picasso, but they are still quite known. Her bad manners, along with her lack of culture, far from representing certain voracity, show an exaggerated picture of the (simplistic, but good) working class in opposition to the (liberal, but \"mean\") intellectual/ high class, a point of view that is already quite clear in the selection of the leading actresses: L\u00e9a Seydoux, granddaughter of the Chairman of Path\u00e9, \"comes from an extremely wealthy, bourgeois, very comfortable milieu\", while Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos \"comes from something that is definitely much more modest\". Just by seeing some photos of the cast and watching the trailer, I knew that Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos and Kechiche's Ad\u00e8le were the same person. It's not a surprise to read that he chose her for the role after seeing her eating a lemon tarte, or to see, in interviews, that she speaks and behaves just like her character does. Kechiche opts for naturalism/realism, but more interesting and challenging would be to put the actresses in the opposite roles. One of the strongest points of the film, this social discourse could bring up an interesting discussion if not build on so many clich\u00e9s. Nonetheless, like Boris says in Woody Allen's \"Whatever Works\", \"sometimes a clich\u00e9 is finally the best way to make one's point\" and Kechiche sure does it showing how sexism is part of the gay community as well: Ad\u00e8le, that has a \"minor\" job and a poor intellect is the good and helpful (house) wife; Lise, a cultured painter, but a mom and a femme, probably \"cooks for Emma when she gets home at night and gives her flowers in the morning\". The butch-femme relationship, an undeniable mirror of heterosexual relationships, usually perpetuates the so discussed stereotypes of male/female's roles.\n\nPerhaps I am becoming too much demanding or too much bitter, but although L\u00e9a Seydoux is very convincing as a lesbian, I didn't see anything fantastic about the performances. If the ending is painful, it is not because of Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos's good acting, but because one can relate to such heartbreak. Loving is painful, growing old is hard, and we all know about it.\n\n\n- You don't love me anymore.\n\n- (no)... But I have infinite tenderness for you. I always will.\n\n\n\n\n* The burden of first love and Ad\u00e8le's inability to move on slightly reminds me of Mia Hansen-L\u00f8ve's film \"Goodbye First Love\".",

The unbridled and seamless character development t allows one to lose themselves  in this  non-action 3 hour film.  Perhaps, once in a decade a film like this appears, that grabs you beyond belief, but all too believable.  It is impossible not to fall in love with the actors, and their true to life credibility.  Adele Exachopoulous as Adele, is so beautiful to watch, and the Lea Seydoux, as Emma, as the relatively older woman  compliments the unfolding passion of Adele.  The explicit sex scenes lets us see erotic passion close up, and you really see how it is impossible for the characters not to fall in love after watching the first love scene between them.  I have heard the director got lot;'s of heat from both cast and crew, but the results is that rare description, that fits the bill for  the story, the acting, and direction- tour de force!",

The filmmaking is just perfect, you can't make more realistic. Kechiche shoots passion between Emma and Ad\u00e8le (which are both played by wonderful actresses : L\u00e9a Seydoux and Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos), emotional et sexual (without voyeurism or porn).
