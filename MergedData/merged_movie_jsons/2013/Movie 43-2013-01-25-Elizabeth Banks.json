The jokes, as intended, has its dark filthy, vulgar humor that would facilitate weak stomachs to throw up with anxiety quiet quickly if you did not already choose to dismiss the film. I loved it plain and simple. And no, I don't know the filmmakers nor was I paid to say this.. I may as just well have a filthy mind just like them... kudos to the filmmaker for taking cinema where most won't. a real breath of fresh air unless you are smelling something rotting in the trash, yet trashy as it may be, for those who choose to go against the current, as this film does, leave you brain at the door and just take it all in... If you are looking for an art film, or a \"Licoln\" or a light sweet romantic comedy or any spiritually stimulating film like that to engage in some sort of intellectual conversation over coffee after seeing this, the reviews here should give you a clue. You may want to dismiss this film altogether... it was obviously not made for you. Otherwise, if you are into gutter humor... you will cry till you gut hurts or until your anxiety of feeling guilty for laughing at such vulgar silliness sets in.",

            "content": "Movie 43 is a collection of twelve short films starring twenty-five big name celebrities and not containing even a fraction of the laughs in its ninety-seven minute runtime. Connected in a disjointed manner and baiting the audience by a filled cast, this is one of the most unpleasant times at the movies one could have. Not since Garry Marshall's Valentine's Day have we seen so many shining actors succumb to such joylessly impotent material. Only this time, the material is not only impotent, but crass and well over the line of reprehensibility to the point where one shakes their head and assures their inner-self to walk out of the theater, walk to the nearest video store and rent as many foreign films as they can carry.Before I go into any of the shorts, let's have a small and formal discussion about offensiveness. At no point was I ever personally offended by anything Movie 43 had to offer, mainly because its attitude to offend in every way possible was distracting and artificial. When looking at the past films I've seen that were deemed \"offensive\" by some, say, Team America: World Police, there was not only fun in its premise, but satire in its writing.The outlying story concerns Dennis Quaid, a desperate man who is pitching a film idea to Greg Kinnear, a filmmaker looking to strike a deal. Quaid will be the one introducing all the setups to Kinnear, and we'll return to the two men after every short to watch Kinnear's contrived reaction and Quaid's facile justification. Let's begin.In the first short, how funny is it to see Kate Winslet and Hugh Jackman go on a date, with everyone being oblivious to the large scrotum attached to his neck except for Winslet? How funny is it when Jackman accidentally gets pubic hair in his soup, and puts his neck-scrotum on a baby's forehead? The next short shows Shameless's Jeremy Allen White as a homeschooled teenager being tormented and manipulated by his parents who are trying to recreate the dangers and turmoils of high school. When the poor kid's mother tries to instigate incestuous sex with her son I wanted to leave the theater and never turn back. But such a thing didn't happen.We then watch Chris Pratt and Anna Faris, who are both married in real life, as a young couple on a romantic date when Faris pops the question; \"will you poop on me?\" she asks her boyfriend. I refuse to comment on where this goes. We are then given the awkward short of a supermarket employee (Kieran Culkin) confessing all the dirty and depraved details of his relationship to his ex-girlfriend (Emma Stone) while accidentally leaving the PA system on, as a crowd of anxious shoppers forms to watch this travesty unfold. Next comes Richard Gere as the boss of a corporation called \"iBabe,\" which is a music player that is a lifelike naked woman, drumming up heaps of controversy. Then a speed dating event involving Batman and Robin (Jason Sudeikis and Justin Long) and Kristen Bell's \"Supergirl,\" who is ostracized for having an unusually large vagina.But probably the most heartless, offensive short of them all involves poor little Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz, who is hanging out with her boyfriend at his home when she experiences her first period. As she is dripping blood as if she has just been stabbed, her boyfriend's older brother (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) helplessly runs around the house screaming and searching for things to clog her uterus (frozen peas and a sponge, anyone?). What follows is a dopey Leprechaun predicament involving Seann William Scott and Johnny Knoxville, a basketball game where Coach Terrence Howard tells his team that because they are facing a white team and they are all black they will win the game, and we end on a shallow and empty-headed note as we expected.The only short I neglected to mention is called \"Truth or Dare,\" starring Halle Berry on a blind date where she initiates a game of truth or dare, which goes on to become a disgusting and repetitive affair. Berry crushes guacamole with her breast (a prosthetic, I assure you) and inserts extra-hot hot sauce into herself with a turkey baster.I can't fathom the thought that I'm explaining this as elaborately as I am. Did the seventeen writers and twelve directors (among them, Peter Farrelly, Elizabeth Banks, Brett Ratner, and Bob Odenkirk) have an ounce of self-awareness to the humor that made their past films work? How did they manage to allow their cast of champions to succumb to demeaning, scatological, desperately unfunny filth? Before you claim the actors did the job for the money, I must inform you that Movie 43 is reported in only costing $6 million to make (excluding marketing costs which I'm willing to bet are ten times more), so that argument is almost wholly invalid. Were they genuinely smitten by the idea and the script of it all, or did they just feel that they all played their careers safe and decided to challenge their comfort zones and the harmless audiences' by attempting to push boundaries? I left the multiplex knowing three things today I had not previously grasped; number one, the spoof/skit genre is uniformly dead, and can not even be revived by a large group of directors, writers, and actors, all reliable and capable. Number two, to not get high hopes for a comedy with large names being released in the month of January. Number three, that in no way, shape, form, or instance is a woman's menstrual cycle funny and to victimize a fifteen year old actress is a simple act of cruelty.On a final note, why is Movie 43 called \"Movie 43?\" Who knows, who cares?",

            "review_title": "A Nutshell Review: Movie 43",
            "content": "If you're up for some short stories in the comedy genre, then this film is for you, if you don't mind jokes that are offensive and appealing to the lowest common denominator, with a star studded lineup to sweeten the deal. Touted as a film with the most stars, it's quite like the many ensemble effort that Hollywood has been churning out of late like Valentine's Day and New Year's Eve, although this consists of no less than 13 separate shorts that for sure had tickled my funny bone.It would be insane to review each and every short film contained within, which were held together and presented as a screwball screenwriter wannabe (Dennis Quaid) whose ideas for a feature film are getting pitched to a studio executive (Greg Kinnear), which allows for a variety of content to be laid out for the purpose of cramming plenty of recognizable faces into lead roles in the respective shorts. Having different directors helm each segment also brought about different styles in presentation, and it couldn't be more over the top crazy when a peek in the credits list see Peter Farelly and Seth MacFarlane having producer credits, the latter seeing his stock rise in recent months.Some highlights of the film that I had enjoyed somehow centered around speed or blind dating - Kate Winslet and Hugh Jackman on a blind date with the latter playing an eligible bachelor which the former will find out why, speed dating amongst a group of superheroes played by Justin Long, Kristen Bell, Jason Sudeikis and Bobby Cannavale, and Halle Berry and Stephen Merchant playing truth or dare during their first blind date with insane results. Others include the segments that poked pun at people's penchant for doing the impossible with technology in iBabe with Richard Gere playing an executive, and Terrence Howard playing a coach in the 50s giving that motivational talk to his basketball team before their all- star match up. There were duds too, such as Emma Stone and Kieren Culkin playing an unlikely couple giving each other sexual innuedos over a supermarket check out counter, or Johnny Knoxville and Seann Wiliam Scott playing the best of friends who get to celebrate the latter's birthday with a leprechaun, that somehow tried too hard and didn't hit its intended highs. Thankfully though these misses were kept to a minimum, and while the others were passable, they benefited from having a scene or two that were outrageously offensive and funny.This is probably Paris Je T'aime and New York I Love You in cruder, and grosser terms. where toilet humour is never out of place, and political incorrectness gets embraced with open arms. A definite must for those who haven't smiled in a while, and need the simplest of reasons to laugh out loud.",

Yet, there was apparently no logic to the episodic nature of the production.This is possibly the worst film I have seen since Plan 9 from Outer Space...but at least that was amusing.

            "content": "Movie 43 (2013) ** 1/2 (out of 4)The trailer to this thing promises that once you've seen it you'll never forget it and that's certainly true. In case you haven't heard, MOVIE 43 is a bunch of small skits with A-list talent that tries to shock and gross you out. This includes a story about a man with testicles on his neck, a mom and dad who make out with their son, a dirty game of truth or dare and countless more idiotic ones. There's no doubt that this film is in very bad taste but it tells you that before you buy your ticket. I know many absolutely hate this movie but I must admit that it made me laugh quite a bit. As with most movies that tell separate stories, this here is incredibly uneven and a lot of this is due to different directors doing stories but it also happens because the stories themselves are quite different in terms of how good they actually are. There are some (the girl's period) that just flame out before they get started but there are others that are just simply funny because you can't believe they went there. Plus, you get Hugh Jackman and Kate Winslet kicking things off in a story you just wouldn't expect to see them doing. That there is rather funny. You can check out the cast listing to see how many big names they were able to get for this thing and it's rather incredible considering what the film is. Still, there's no way around the fact that only about 50% of the jokes actually work, which is why I can't give the film a higher rating. With that said, I think if you like really dark comedy that crosses the lines of taste then you're at least going to laugh some here. The film certainly isn't perfect but I think it offers enough to make it worth viewing.",

            "content": "\"Movie 43\" qualifies as the kind of movie that scrapes the underside of the bottom of the barrel. Mind you, I love tasteless trash like the \"Scary Movie\" franchise and \"The Groove Tube.\" Lowest common denominator, gross-out garbage accurately describes this offal. This scatologically slanted stuff consists of a series of non-connected vignettes with major Hollywood stars lending their talent. The 'who's who' cast includes Halle Berry, Sean William Scott, Johnny Knoxville, Gerard Butler, Common, Emma Stone, Hugh Jackman, Kate Winslet, Greg Kinnear, Liev Schreiber, Dennis Quaid, Anna Faris, Richard Gere, Naomi Watts, and Seth MacFarlane. These prestigious players must have done this movie for scale because few appear in more than one episode. Basically, a man who has never written a screenplay holds a producer at gunpoint and pulls a version of \"The Player\" with a variety of pitches for various movies. Occasionally, a commodity is featured in a faux commercial. The running gag here is an iBabe, a life-size version of an iPhone, only the iBabe is a gorgeous looking lass without a stitch on and you see everything she has. You plug into her and listen to your favorite tunes. The corporation that makes the iBabe encounters a sticky problem. Apparently, horny juveniles have been inserting their penis into the air-vent slot located in the fake vagina where a fan that keeps the product cool. As a result, these misguided perverts have had their dicks mutilated. Nothing about this movie is imaginative, subtle, entertaining, and/or hilarious. The first scene sets the tone for everything that ensues. A woman (Kate Winslet of \"Titanic\") goes out on a blind date with a famous man (Hugh Jackman of \"The Wolverine\") and discovers to her horror that he has a pair of testicles dangling from his throat like pedants. Later, a couple of well-meaning parents apply tough love to their son as they home-school him and make his life total hell. They constantly berate and humiliate him. In another episode, Ana Faris is cast as a single gal who wants her guy to 'poop' on her because she thinks they are soul mates. Nothing about this bowel humor is remotely funny, especially if you've seen \"Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle.\" Jason Sudeikis plays Batman in a segment entitled \"Super Hero Speed Dating.\" He crouches under a caf\u00e9 table at a restaurant while Justin Long as Robin tries to get dates with Lois Lane (Uma Thurman) and Supergirl (Kristen Bell of \"Forgetting Sarah Marshall\") with Wonder Woman (Leslie Bibb of \"Iron Man\") in the background. Just when you thought things couldn't get worse, Elizabeth Banks of \"The Hunger Games\" and Josh Duhamel of \"Transformers\" appear in an animated segment called \"Beezel.\" Beezel is a perverted animated cat who adores his master enough to run over Banks with an SUV. You know you're watching something unusual when Beezel behaves like a voyeur. He hides in the closet while the lovers are at play and watches them with a plush toy underneath him and a brush with which he strokes his anus.As amusing as all this sounds, \"Movie 43\" doesn't have a single, legitimate laugh. Okay, just because Hollywood will try anything once to make a buck doesn't mean you have to watch it. Frankly, \"Movie 43\" doesn't deserve one star, but IMDb doesn't have a zero star rating so I am grudgingly going with one star",

            "review_title": "Still not as bad as \"That's My Boy\"",
            "content": "With a title that doesn't seem to have anything to do with the movie itself, \"Movie 43\" is essentially a bunch of individual comedy sketches that are not so much offensively vulgar (as promised) as they are offensively unfunny; and sloppily put together at that. Directed by a slew of different directors (but mostly by Peter Ferrely) and starring Kate Winslet, Liev Schreiber, Anna Faris, Naomi Watts, Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry and the list goes on (but you've surely seen the trailers by now) \"Movie 43\" is the newest movie hoping to push the boundaries of the raunchy American comedy. So, does it succeed? My consensus has to be\u0085ehhhhhhh.Yes, this is all very sophomoric, but that's not to say that there are not laughs to be found. In saying that, while I don't share quite the same loathsome regard for this film as many of my fellow critics do, those who come out of \"Movie 43\" proclaiming it a laugh riot, are probably the same people who classify Adam Sandler as a comedian or amuse themselves by watching syndicated episodes of America's Funniest Home Videos. Even with its star power and the potential comedic material each sketch promises, \"Movie 43\" isn't really a film worth watching. In fact, I will go so far as to make the early prediction that this is one film which seems destined to make it onto more than a few peoples \"worst of 2013\" lists.Aside from the first two sketches (which are admittedly pretty damn funny) a final sketch which works primarily because of Terrance Howard (the African American basketball skit from the trailer) and a post final credit segment concerning a woman played by Elizabeth Banks, who is jealous of her boyfriend's pet cat (animated cat) that is somewhat funny, \"Movie 43\" is simply not nearly as funny as it promotes itself to be. In fact, about an hour and fifteen minutes of this movie is so unfunny, that it rivals anything seen in the \"Scary Movie\" franchise. And to top it all off, it's not like I haven't seen comedies which are more vulgar than this; and done better. So even to say that one should see \"Movie 43\" because it is the most vulgar movie of all time is in fact a misnomer; but one which will undoubtedly result in garnering more ticket sales.Side Note: This is the type of sketch comedy movie that seems as if the actors had more fun making it than anybody could have watching it. So, no doubt there will be many critical reviews comparing this film to a bad episode of Saturday Night Live, in a tired attempt at comedy. But creating comedic parallels between \"Movie 43\" and SNL may be a misconception, when sadly most of this film is motivated by uninventive poo poo and pee pee jokes, more so the likes of the defunked MADTV, than any other sketch comedy show.Final Thought: Even though it's the cocktail of wishful thinking that maybe the next bit is going to be better than the last boring bit, or the morbid curiosity that comes from wanting to see who will be the next big name actor/actress to make an appearance that does give this film it's momentum, \"Movie 43\" is severely hindered by the fact that it contains a runtime longer than 15 minutes. So, here's my advice: The first sketch in this movie centers around a woman played by Kate Winslet going out on a blind date, only to discover that it is with a man played by Hugh Jackman. Delighted by her good fortune, she prepares to accompany him for dinner. But when Jackman takes off his scarf, it is discovered that he has been hiding a mortifyingly hilarious secret. Now, I have just outlined the funniest sketch of the entire film. So, if you sit through this one, and don't laugh once, what I want you to do is, get up, make your way to the theater's box office and ask for your money back, because for you, it will only get worse from here.Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I.

This is truly the citizen cane of bad movies. Girls gone dead used to be the worst film I have ever seen until I watched this, in the same freaking day, one of the worst days ever. This is the toilet bowl where bad films do their business. So here we go.First things first, it's not funny, it didn't even get a small chuckle out of me. It proclaims it's offencive, but I call bull-SH-t, it's disgusting and immature. The humour is something kindergarten students would make up, hell, kindergarten students aren't even this immature. The only time I'll agree with that little brat Chloe Grace MORETZ is when she said \"I want to kill myself\". I mean F****CK!, I'm mad as hell. Balls on babies faces and pooping on each other is what this film has to offer. It had me rolling my eyes and sighing left and right. It's just sick and degrading of the mind, it doesn't even try to be funny, I spent more time watching the time go by than I did watching the film. Batman the as-hole was the only time it even came close to having something to work with. The IBABE was just pointless graphic nudity, I feel sorry for those two actresses. Denis Quaid seemed to be the only one who even tried. And the 17 minute long credits with the cat jerking off, screw you for torturing me, film.Please, for the love of GOD, stay away from this film. I'd rather watch baby geniuses, or garbage pale kids, or Santa Claus and the ice-cream bunny, anything but this abomination. This film must suffer the tortures of the damned. It must never harm anyone else, this film is the pure essence of evil. It must be destroyed in the fires of mount doom. It SUCKS SOOOO BAD, I can't take it.

Quit fooling yourselves into thinking you're better than the film. It is nothing more than what it is: tasteless, raunchy, gut-wrenching laughable humor. Yes, in fact I did say gut-wrenching laughter. I laughed my ass off through most of the movie. Why? Because it was funny.Yes, it was funny. Don't you all remember the days of Monty Python and Airplane! and There's Something About Mary and Scary Movie? Whatever happened to the light-hearted movies of decades ago, where it was more important to make light of life and just about everything in it rather than pander to some sort of artistic elite? Screw them! I still love Benny Hill! Hollywood has been full of itself for far, far too long. We are tired of every movie under the sun that we see having to be so serious and making some kind of a \"social statement\" or having some sort of modern-style realism. Enough. We want to laugh. We want to have fun. We want to find ourselves engrossed in the basest of the human experience because, well, that's something we all share in common with one another. The animal experience of human nature is just as important as our intellectual and psychological experience. Don't ever forget that.Every movie doesn't need to be over-analyzed with 50 paragraphs of explanation on how much you hate it. Has America become so sexually repressed that even the mere mention of sex, or seeing a nude body on the big screen, makes everyone automatically challenge the context of the sexuality? Some things are just as they seem -- indulgences which make us proud to be adults and experience adult humor. If you want to laugh at pompous violence and style, go see Tarantino's latest flick. If you want to laugh at something unfunny, try any of the latest Ren\u00e9e Zellweger or Meryl Streep borefest. Perhaps you all give Sasha Cohen a pass because at least his raunchy stories are \"coherent\"? Who cares? A movie is not bad simply because it does not conform to the Hollywood norm, nor is it bad simply because you don't think it was deep enough. I thought almost everybody in the picture (many talented actors and actresses) did a fine job making us laugh. I was on the floor for half of the movie, and my wife enjoyed it just as much as I did. Have you all forgotten how to just let go and enjoy the moment? Wake up, guys. There are plenty of genuinely bad movies out there. This is not one of them.",

I saw a review that made a comparison to \"Kentucky Fried Movie\" but I would have to say that although \"Kentucky Fried Movie\" definitely had quite a few skits that fell flat, in \"Movie 43\" they pretty much ALL fall flat. What's the reason? Well, either the skits had plots that simply COULDN'T be funny (such as a lady begging her boyfriend to defecate on her as well as the guy with testicles growing on his neck) or they were funny ideas but were handled so horribly that they fell totally flat. A great example are the parents who want to make home schooling like real schooling (complete with lots of trauma)...a funny concept but taken way, way, way too far...and lacked subtlety and seemed as if it was made by someone who knows NOTHING about comedic timing.\nI think the most amazing thing about this movie is that it does have quite a few famous stars in it...such as Hugh Jackman, Dennis Quaid, Chris Pratt, Emma Stone, Kate Winslet and many others. How were they able to get real stars to act in this film? Could it be that they never read the scripts?! Could it be that the filmmakers held members of the stars' families hostage and forced them to be in this terrible movie?!

It does go from story to story, the whole movie basically you just keep asking yourself what will they come up with next. Each story is crazier than the other and more twisted, but that is exactly what makes it so frigging funny. The cast is also pretty amazing, have to admit, to my surprise, because of the offensive humor in this.

Ultimately the title represents ideas even if they should remain so. The film is vulgar to the highest degree but credit must be given to the unpredictable buildup of some of the jokes. We have Kate Winslet on a blind date where she discovers a pair of testicles dangling from her date's throat. We have a kid home schooled by parents who give their son glimpses of harsh school realities including Naomi Watts as his mother giving him his first kiss. Halle Berry is involved in an Internet dating situation that involves graphic variations of Truth Or Dare. Anna Faris confesses to her fianc\u00e9 her desire to be pooped on, which concludes with a collision that no car wash could solve. Elizabeth Banks is schemed upon by her boyfriend's animated cat, which results in her being drenched in gooey urine. Greg Kinnear ends up being the poor sap listening to these crazy ideas from Quaid and eventually being driven to support it all. We have themes of puberty, Leprechaun captures, Superhero Speed Dating that goes horribly wrong for Robin, and the I-Babe, a naked female I-Pod with a penis mutilating side effect. Tasteless, vulgar and offensive but also a great play on the warped minds of ideas and their screen translation. Score: 8 / 10",

            "content": "To say that \"Movie 43\" is tasteless and likely to offend merely restates the claims of its own publicity - it actually seems proud of the fact. It is all of that and more. The one thing that was omitted from the blurb is that the movie isn't particularly funny.The film is a series of episodes that play out as Dennis Quaid's character pitches them to a producer. There are over a dozen episodes each with a different director, although I didn't bother to count them. Some of the sequences feature high profile stars.The first episode is actually mildly amusing in a \"Monty Python\" sort of way. Beth (Kate Winslet) and Davis (Hugh Jackman) are on a blind date when she notices that he has a pair of testicles growing out of his throat. All the humour is derived from her attempts to ignore the obvious, unnatural impediment.That sequence is actually the high point, it's downhill after that, with very few real laughs to follow. There is an unfortunate emphasis on excrement in a number of the episodes and you know how it is with that substance - it's all in the timing. And that is one of the most alarming things about this movie; very few of the thirteen or so directors show much comedic timing at all. Either that or they just couldn't wring much out of the rather juvenile script.I also think some of the stars who appeared in this have been ill served by their agents. Of course, as Hollywood history shows, actors famously don't always make the best choices, but surely, somewhere along the way, Hugh Jackman's agent or Halle Berry's should have said, \"Hey, you don't need to do this one, I'll find you something better\". The only reason that would explain why good stars would get caught up in a misfire like \"Movie 43\", other than being paid a lot of money for a small amount of work, which apparently they weren't, is that maybe they only ever saw their segment and were unaware of the content of the others - maybe? With some of the more tasteless episodes in \"Movie 43\", I remembered a line in the far funnier \"God Bless America\", when Joel Murray's character, Frank Murdoch, makes a telling observation, \"This is the, 'Oh no! You didn't say that' generation\". I think that just about sums up the inspiration behind the making of this movie.Anyway, why talk about \"Movie 43\" anymore? After the first couple of episodes, the whole thing is pretty obvious - nasty, but obvious. Enough said - it's \"Movie 00\" as far as I'm concerned.",

            "content": "'MOVIE 43': Four Stars (Out of Five)Already one of the most notorious films in movie history (at least with critics) this indie anthology sketch comedy film contains one of the biggest cast of stars (of any film in cinema history) and was written and directed by a variety of pretty talented and famous filmmakers. The movie is a series of comedy short films (each made by a different director and featuring different cast members) that are all connected through another intersecting short, which ties them all together (there's two different versions of the film with two different intersecting short films as their story arch). It was produced by the usual comedy team of Peter Farrelly and Charles B. Wessler as well as Ryan Kavanaugh and John Penotti. The list of directors includes Farrelly (who directed two of the shorts), James Gunn and Brett Ratner as well as actors turned directors Griffine Dunne and Elizabeth Banks (to name a few). The cast includes the likes of Hugh Jackman, Kate Winslet, Halle Berry, Naomi Watts, Liev Schreiber, Kristen Bell, Kate Bosworth, Jason Sudeikis, Justin Long, Emma Stone, Gerard Butler, Johnny Knoxville, Sean William Scott, Terrence Howard, Richard Gere, Uma Thurman, Elizabeth Banks, Josh Duhamel, Chloe Grace Moretz, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Seth MacFarlane, Greg Kinnear, Dennis Quaid and many many more. I thought the movie was hilarious at times, parts of it were too over-the-top and disgusting but it was also extremely funny more often than not. Some of it doesn't work at all but at least it takes a lot of chances (which is more than you can say for most films).The main plot line involves Quaid as an insane director trying to pitch a bunch of bad movie ideas to a film executive, played by Kinnear (in one version). The other version of the film has a group of teenagers (Mark L. Young, Adam Cagley and Devin Eash) searching for the world's most banned movie on the internet (this version played in theaters in other countries). Some of the highlights of the film include shorts revolving around blind dates. One involves Jackman playing a man with testicles on his neck going out with a businesswoman played by Kate Winslet. Another tells the story of a woman and a man on a date at a Mexican restaurant (played by Berry and Stephen Merchant) who keep challenging each other to more and more extreme dares (in a game of truth or dare). Yet another blind date short focuses on superheroes (Sudeikis, Long and Bell) speed dating in Gotham City. Some other really funny segments include a couple (real life couple Watts and Schreiber) trying to copy the true experiences of high school for their son (Jeremy Allen White) while home-schooling him. Another short revolves around a couple where a woman (Anna Faris) exposes herself as a corophiliac who wants her boyfriend (Chris Pratt) to romantically defecate on her (probably the most disgusting segment but also extremely funny). The movie is a lot like 'SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE' 'The Movie' for me; just more vulgar and extreme (as well as more funny). It's almost exactly like watching 'SNL' actually; you've got big stars doing outrageous things in different sketch shorts. Some are really funny and some miss the mark but I always admired the effort. This movie has a lot more skits that work, than you're average 'SNL' episode, so I'd say it's at least similar to a 'best of' compilation show but I think it's more like what the classic comedy variety show would be if it were made in to a theatrical movie. The filmmakers say that they were trying to emulate the classic anthology comedy film 'THE KENTUCKY FRIED MOVIE' but that film was basically like an 'SNL' flick as well. Some will hate this movie (especially uptight critics) and some will be disgusted and offended by it (but that's what it's supposed to do). Some might not find it funny at all (either) but I'm betting most would if they gave it a chance.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUymXeqlea0",

The marketing team must have had a hell of a time trying to sell \"Movie 43\" to the general public because it's a comedy that really isn't about anything. It's a series of skits strung together by a barely cohesive narrative. Of course, there have been many skit films before \"Movie 43,\" but this is the first film to be backed by a major studio and to have a litany of A-list actors, actresses, and filmmakers involved. The film is centers on an unkempt \"screenwriter\" (played by Dennis Quaid), who is trying to pitch his movie to a Hollywood executive (played by Greg Kinnear). Much like the rest of the movie, their situation begins to spiral into absurdity, and in between we are treated to a series of mock ads and strange scenarios that increasingly build on their gags until they just eventually sort of end. \"Movie 43\" fares best in its first half, as the film's opening half hour boasts a number of amusing shorts - including a bit of silliness featuring Naomi Watts and Liev Schreiber as parents who take the home-schooling concept to very dark places. However, the film begins to lose steam somewhere around the midway point, inundated with sketches that are completely pointless and desperately unfunny. The second half of the film is loaded with skits that are either disastrously overlong or problematic; quickly losing any appeal that might be left. If the sketches have any unifying style, it's that they go for shock value over genuine laughs most of the time. \"Movie 43\" is best suited for in the home-entertainment market, where these short story dilemmas can be hashed out between bong rips and consuming large amounts of alcohol.",

I understand people not liking the film. It is an *intense* blue comedy and more than a fair share of gags crossover into the gross instead of funny territory. But for my money more than enough gags land to be worthwhile. Several of the sections-the batman parody, the opening date sequence, animated cat-are quite funny and in the case of the opening date sort of clever behind the blue comedy. There is an twilight zone edge Winslet slowly losing her mind because no one else seems to notice the gag. A few are serviceable as well.Now it is true several sections are quite bad. iBabe was pretty useless along with the one with Emma Stone. But the worse offender was the Proposition. It is easily the grossest short in the anthology and it is largely not funny. More to the point it is placed too soon in context and undermines the framing device. It is hard to top that one for blue comedy content and the film never quite recovers. I feel so bad for Pratt. It should have been removed entirely or placed much later in the movie.The framing device is a quasi-successful satire of the vapidness of mainstream film making, especially the disposable comedies al Tag that come out ever summer. This attempt to ground the shorts in a larger statement sets the movie apart for me. It is not a success-it does not work in the end-but the film is more engaging than a lot of other films that have come out.The film is not good but it *is* different.

Honestly, I couldn't even make it past the 1-hour mark before I had to stop watching, and I rarely get so tired of a movie that I have to stop. To tell you the truth, if I could rate it a 0/10 on here I would, it's that bad. The movie essentially centers around Dennis Quaid's character trying to get his movie purchased from a studio, by any means necessary. Well this \"movie\" is less of a movie and more of a bunch of skits, horrible skits, that feature endless stupidity and minimal, if any, laughter. Honestly, I feel like they should've paid me to watch this movie and I watched it for free. I truly feel sorry for anyone who watched this in theaters. They should steal awards from any actor who appeared in this film. Just pathetic.",

The only sketch I thought was funny, was the one with Emma Stone and Kieran Culkin, cause they both seem to put in effort into it, cause Emma Stone can be funny without trying.

They both focus on the gross and screwball comedy, which, of course, is one of the main features of this movie and do not quite appreciate the \"second level\", the bitter satire on what western society is becoming. Thus, I am going to examine every single episode one by one: 1)A modern version of Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale \"The emperor's new clothes\": Nobody seems to notice the monstrosity of Hugh Jackman's character because he's rich and handsome. 2)A satire on the stupidity of the average American parent in educating kids. 3)A potshot thrown at western rituals of courtship. 4)Harold Pinter (theatre of the absurd) in a porn version. It could be the beginning of a new genre. 5)A satire on tech corporations and a respectful parody of Cronenemberg movies such as \"Existenz\". 6)I despise nerds ,most kind of comics and films related to comics, so it was a terrific experience for me to watch this one. 7)A potshot at the stupidity of the average western male of all ages. 8)The only zany episode, although I really enjoyed the Irish dwarfs and Stiffler. 9)Another satire on courtship, this time focused on on-line dating. 10)A parody on all epic sport movies related to political or racial issues, like \"Invictus\"e.g.,which mainly have two problems: 10.1)The unbearable amount of empty rhetoric throughout the whole movie. 10.2)The actors are not pro, so the agonistic level is utterly ridiculous. 11)A potshot at branded products of stupid cartoons for children (they could not use \"Hello Kitty\" for copyright issues but that was the target). To sum up, like I said in the summary this movie succeeds in conveying the message, while \"Idiocracy\" failed.",

As stated above, the previews for this title that featured many of our most beloved Hollywood icons grabbed my attention immediately. I was led to believe that this would be a fun-loving laugh-a-thon with clever jokes and convincing gags. Before too long, it was apparent that this was a multi-segmented movie with a different crew behind each sketch and by the end of the second segment, I was already let down. Regardless, I decided not to leave mid-feature for I paid good money at the box office for premium seating. I endured the remainder of the movie having only bellowed a chuckle or two. I was actually surprised to realize that the majority of the comical content, portrayed by a plethora of well-respected performers, was eighth-grade, toilet bowl humor which I only found amusing during my adolescent years.

This and had it not been for finding out one of my all time favourite films 'Freddie got fingered' had only received 4-5 stars by IMDb reviewers. The previous film mentioned is an acquired taste granted but, i'm British. I grew up on some of the most bizarre comedy you could imagine. Anyone who's seen 'Benny Hill', 'Monty Python', 'The Kenny Everett show' and other shows that in them days were breaking new ground for comedy but, still bizarre in their own right will understand. So armed with my self- belief that 'Brits know best', i gave this a go. It is pretty pathetic and the writers need to buy a dictionary and find the definition of 'comedy'. I just don't get it!!! The idea of this is that someone suggested they/we make an outrageous comedy with a star studded line up. Great idea in principal if you have a simple-even if unbelievable-story line with a nice pace to back it up with things that could be defined as funny. I find the vulgar elements in shows like Little Britain and South Park hilarious. South Park is my favourite show on TV. Its vulgar, crass, racist, anti-semitic, etc, but, there is always a point to the satire. I truly am struggling to find something to praise this with. This film has picked all those vulgar things that make kids giggle at the back of the class-which is hilarious given the market it is aimed at-and come up with this disjointed unfunny mess. Granted there a few moments that raised a grin but, its not enough to budge over 1 star for this. Really, really poor effort and a poor reflection on the Ego's of the people who scripted this.

            "content": "Comedy- A work intended to be humorous and/or to bring about laughter from the observer/audience.In the dictionary, \"Movie 43\" should be an example of an antonym for comedy.\"Movie 43\" is one of those special kinds of bad movies. One of those rarities that doesn't just fail... it fails so spectacularly on such a grand scale that it actually sort-of makes you angry as an audience member. It gives you the same sort-of sinking feeling and rage that you used to feel when the schoolyard bully would make fun of you and then beat you up on the playground. And the same sort-of embarrassment you'd feel afterwords, when you realized that everyone saw it happening.Except here, the rage and sinking feeling isn't from a bully, it's from your intelligence being insulted. And the embarrassment isn't for you... it's the embarrassment you feel for the actors on-screen.Produced by Peter Farrelly and directed by a fairly large group of filmmakers (each handling a specific scene or scenes), \"Movie 43\" is a failed attempt at making a sort-of classic \"sketch/anthology comedy movie\" along the same lines of \"Kentucky Fried Movie\" or \"The Groove Tube.\" It puts a primary focus on scatological, crude and sexual comedy . Which can be done well and humorously in some cases, but here, it falls flat and feels uneven, undeveloped and contrived.Encompassing around a dozen-or-so sketches, we are \"treated\" to some ghastly stories, inexplicably starring some of Hollywood's biggest names, including Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, Elizabeth Banks, Justin Long and Kate Winslet. Sketches range in focus from a man who unfortunately has a piece of male anatomy growing from his chin, to a woman with a Coprophilia fetish (don't google that, please), to a man capturing a leprechaun, to tampons. And while I will admit one or two of the more tasteful sketches do supply the occasional and very demented chuckle, on the whole, it's a completely humorless and frustrating experience. (Those occasional chuckles are few and far between... maybe three instances during the entire 90 or so minutes)The thing with comedy is that the joke needs to make some semblance of sense, and needs to actually make an effort to have development and pay- off. Here, the filmmakers (including Steven Brill, Brett Ratner and James Gunn among many others) are so eager to prove that they can make over-the-top gross-out gags, that there's no real attention paid to the actual comedic set-up or timing. Each scene feels like a punch-line with no set-up, robbing them of their impact. And the overall adult-oriented crude humor combines with this to make the film just feel overly exploitative and aggressively unfunny. Simply seeing Hugh Jackman with male genitalia on his chin on its own is not a joke. Simply seeing human feces on its own is not a joke. Etc. Yet this film treats these sort-of scenarios as though they are fully developed gags, even though they clearly aren't. And that's where the film delves into the angering and embarrassment that I mentioned earlier.At one point in my viewing experience, I paused the film to contemplate whether or not this film was actually a cleverly disguised example of \"Anti-Humor\"- a concept in which the jokes are purposely so unfunny, that they become funny as a result in a very ironic way. (Almost like \"So bad, it's good\", but on purpose) However, upon resuming the film and really paying attention, it becomes clear that this isn't an attempt at \"Anti-Humor.\" These performers, directors and writers are honestly trying to tell good jokes. And to be blunt, I don't think they would be clever enough in these circumstances to even attempt purposeful \"Anti- Humor.\"\"Movie 43\" is one of those bad films that you won't soon forget. It's painful to watch and even frustrating. And it really is something I believe everyone involved will leave off of their r\u00e9sum\u00e9 in the future. I know if I was making a movie, I wouldn't hire anyone who listed this film in the credits.\"Movie 43\" is easily a 1 out of 10. One of the worst comedies of the decade.",

What amuses me is something that doesn't take place in any of the skits. I'm wondering how much this all star cast was bribed, cajoled, and paid to star in this BS? I'd love to be a fly on the wall with those discussions. I'll break down the various shorts for you\"The Pitch\"This stars Dennis Quaid & Greg Kinnear. This occurs off and on throughout the film and it bookends each skit. It's not very funny to say the least, but Kinnear is solid\"The Catch\"Hugh Jackman & Kate Winslet are in this one. Winslet goes on a blind date with Hugh Jackman, and all seems to be fine, but Jackman has a certain deformity on his neck. It turns out that a ball sack his hanging from his neck and Winslet can't get around it. Plenty of ball gags ensue, but none of them are remotely funny, and it comes across as just plain weird\"Homeschooled\"This one fares a bit better and is at least tolerable. It stars Naomi Watts & Liev Schreiber. They decide to Homeschool their kid and have him experience all the hi-jinks and the terrifying things about high school right in their home. He gets bullied throughout the segment in all kinds of ways. I didn't exactly laugh, but it was interesting to say the least\u0085\"The Proposition\" Anna Farris & Chris Pratt (Real life couple) star in this one. This is another unfunny skit. Pratt wants to pop the question, but Farris has a question she needs to pop on her own. She has a bizarre fetish and asks him to poop on her face\u0085 (No\u0085 I'm not making this up!) Pratt poops on her face\u0085 what follows is some of the weirdest things you'll ever see\u0085 Words can't do it justice\"Veronica\" Another real life couple; Emma Stone & Kieran Culkin star in this one; They are a split up couple and talk dirty to one another at a supermarket\u0085 f***@k all happens and Culkin decides to chase after her. Easily the most pointless of the bunch\"Superhero Speed Dating\"This one wasn't very good either, but better than the previous two. Jason Sudekis plays Batman; Justin Long plays Robin (Batman's sidekick) Sam Rockwell, and Uma Thurman (As Lois Lane) Kristen Bell (As Supergirl. Still cute as a button) and Leslie Bibb as Wonder Woman; If plenty of vagina jokes are your thing, dig in\u0085\"Ibabe\"This stars Richard Gere & Kate Bosworth. This is extremely stale stuff that has been done before. Next!\"Middle School Date\"This stars Hollywood's new \"It\" girl Chloe Moretz & and that McLovin' due from Superbad. Puddy, aka Patrick Warburton also shows up. Moretz has her first period and nobody knows how to react to it. You guessed it! Not very funny\"Happy Birthday\" This stars Gerald Butler as a Leprechaun. Sean William Scott & Johnny Knoxville are in this as well. Knoxville tries to make amends for sleeping with Scott's girlfriend, so he gets him a leprechaun. Butler swears a lot in unfunny ways, and violence ensues\"Truth Or Dare\"Halle Berry and Stephen Merchant star in this one. Berry is bored of blind dates, so they decide to play truth or dare. The highlight of this one is probably Halle dipping her new giant (fake) breast implants into guacamole dump.\"Victory's Glory\"This one stars Terrance Howard. Before their face racially integrated game, Howard gives a pep talk. It fails and they get their asses kicked. That's all there is to it\"BEEZEL\"This one stars the gorgeous Elizabeth Banks & Josh Duhammel. This one is actually slightly amusing. The only one in the movie! It's about an animated cat that is highly attracted to Duhammel, but dislikes Banks with a passion, and does everything it can to break them up. The problem is Duhammel won't believe Banks. Highlight is the cat giving himself pleasure to Josh Duhammel in a picture of a swimsuitFinal Thoughts: You have no idea how hard this was to get through. Every single one of the skits was unfunny, except for Beezel. This is a train wreck of epic proportions. Let me tell you something.

There is no vision or creativity here, its literally just a bunch of unrelated 5-minute skits. I could at least give this movie some credit if the skits were funny at all, but they're not. They're all disgusting and repulsive. As I sat through the first skit, I was like \"well that sucked, maybe the next one will be better\". After the next four, I was like \"well maybe one of them will make me laugh\". I was wrong. The rest was just a vapid, soulless, agonizing experience. I didn't laugh, chuckle, or even involuntarily smile during this whole movie. The whole product just feels cynically slapped together with no respect for its audience and for the sole purpose of making money. Many of the celebrities they got were either bribed or guilt tripped into being in their skits. This isn't even a real movie; its like a bunch of unfunny YouTube videos mashed together. Think of the 15 worst Smosh videos you've seen, and watch them back to back. That's basically this movie but with more depraved sexually graphic content and random celebrities. You'd have a lot more fun watching YouTube videos for 90 minutes than watching Movie 43. Normally I have no problem with gross and inappropriate content, but only if there's a point. This movie represents everything wrong with Hollywood. Slimy film business practices typically only happen occasionally behind the scenes of most mainstream films. Every decision involved in the making of this movie started with the thought \"We could exploit the Hollywood system by...\". Movies like this are the reason IMDb should allow a 0- star rating. This movie is nothing. This movie deserves nothing. Therefore, I shall give it nothing.0/10",

I laughed once or twice at the trailer and I always try to remain an optimist even though the RT score was just terrible. 15 minutes in, I knew I was in trouble. Halfway through, there were points my inner monologue was screaming at just how unfunny this was. When the end credits rolled, I was in disbelief at what I had seen. How could this many talented people come together to make one of the worst pieces of *#!^ I had ever seen? Even if you just love watching crappy movies, this is still something that shouldn't be watched under any circumstances.This is an anthology movie so we have a central thread where Charlie (Dennis Quaid) is holding a film executive Griffin (Greg Kinnear) at gun point and he's going through all his ideas for new movies. The rest of the movie is comprised of skits featuring A and B list actors/actresses. It was inspired by classic anthologies like Kentucky Fried Movie and was brought to life by Charlie Wessler and Peter Farrelly. The talent in front of the camera is astounding. Listing even some of the actors: Hugh Jackman, Kate Winslet, Liev Schreiber, Naomie Watts, Chris Pratt, Anna Faris, Emma Stone etc. This is a director's dream (there's a different director for almost every skit) and yet the end result is horrifyingly bad. The plot really is secondary, the separate skits are all based on some gross-out gag (incest, testicles, periods, crapping on your significant other to give you a couple of examples) and I would normally criticize the creative team for running things into the ground but you have to be funny in the first place.The skits range from at best being mediocre (Veronica wasn't funny but it wasn't offensively bad), to bad (iBabe, The Catch), to the downright awful (Beezel took the cake and it was regrettably directed by James Gunn). There isn't anything humorous or even redeemable about this movie.Watching another terrible movie (Branded) brought me back to thinking about this. This holds the distinction of being maybe one of five movies I've ever scored lower than a 3. If you show up with a camera, some actors and a script, I'll spot you 3 points. You have to do something to make me angry or offend me to go lower. This is an especially bad movie that deserves every bit of venom that was launched at it. Don't watch this movie.",

I don't know why anybody would pan this film, except that maybe they saw the cast, and thought it was a good idea to take their kids to an R-rated movie. And if you are one of THOSE people, you are beyond help. It was funny to see Wolverine with chin testicles. It was funny to see a naked woman that plays music (if that was a real product, and it was priced to compete with an iPod, I would run, not walk to my local electronics store to buy an iBabe). It's a funny movie, it's not supposed to be taken seriously, and it doesn't have any kind of deep meaning. Just because a film isn't deep doesn't mean it can't be entertaining.

In fact, I like a lot of such films that critics tend to pan - films with a core market of manic teenage boys living in a dysfunctional family situation. This film was obviously targeted to such an audience. But, that's not the problem.The film itself looks like it was designed by committee. It moved from one disgusting vignette to another with nothing shown that might tie them all together - other than kids farting around on computers. It was kind of like throwing paint balls at a bare canvas - then, afterward, cutting out all the paint blotches to sew them together into some sort of cohesive whole. Well, it just didn't work.But I did give the film 1 star for \"educational\" value. There may be a few people out there who still believe that acting is a noble profession. But largely, acting is simply a business to most actors. If you pay most actors a certain amount of money - even actors whose names are associated with more worthwhile projects - the content of what they act in is non sequitur.

Despite this, the film still managed to fall flat on its face, leaving me with a bad feeling, much as I'm sure Alex DeLarge felt in A Clockwork Orange. The premise of the movie is extremely basic: A would-be producer is pitching various ideas for movies and advertisements to a Hollywood executive, and each is shown as it would look if filmed. This back to back barrage of random skits is much like the \"Scary Movie\" and \"Epic Movie\" films. Typically, I find most entertainment media with this style to be anywhere from bland to awful, and Movie 43 is no exception.The most prevalent problem with Movie 43 is that it is simply not funny, for the most part. I shall admit that a particular skit about a home schooled boy and his parents desperation to recreate high school at home got me laughing a few times, but none of the others matched it. Not only are the skits really not all that funny, they're unbelievably ridiculous. The setups feel incredible forced and uninspired, and makes me wonder if this is really the best they could come up with. I do realize that it's humorous for a producer to be proposing these ideas in all seriousness, but this would be something that would work better for just one or two skits, not an entire movie based on the same running gag. If you're interested in seeing this movie because of it's star studded cast, do not bother. Most of your favorites will get a few minutes of screen time at best, and trust me when I say they are not used to their full potential. I found myself shaking my head at every skit and thinking \"Come one, *insert star name here*, you really agreed to this?\" Movie 43 is a perfect example of quality vs quantity. Although this type of movie relies on multiple short stories, I feel it would have been wiser to make fewer, longer skits with more effort put into each, rather than just skit after skit with not much thought in any of them. I only recommend this movie if you truly have nothing better to do with your time or money.",

Kentucky Fried Movie springs to mind, and Amazon Women On The Moon featured a lot of stars, so the presence of high profile talent in such films is well established - and Movie 43, as can be seen, is no exception (incidentally, USA viewers may be puzzled by the title as they have a different framing sequence). However, earlier films did not make a point of pursuing outrageous tastelessness quite as single-mindedly as this movie - even those sections which don't sound outrageous are pretty outrageous, mostly (but not exclusively) sexually.Tastelessness per se is not a problem for me, but I do like it to be matched up with humour. And, to be fair, I did laugh from time to time. But the problem is that outrageousness is at the top of this film's list, and humour is relatively low down. Yes, there is something inherently amusing about Man Of The Moment Hugh Jackman sporting a prominent scrotum at the front of his neck, and Oscar winner Kate Winslet being the only one who sees anything peculiar about it. But that's the joke - yes, I got it, now you need to do something with it. And none of these skits - all mercifully brief, but none brief enough - actually goes anywhere very much other than as far as they can up the Outrageousness Tree.You may enjoy it - I chuckled from time to time. You may get something out of the high profile performers slumming it and going really lowest common denominator.But I think it's just as likely that you may not",

The humor attempts to be \"offending\", but it instead sounds like something an 8th grader finds humorous. In fact, even an 8th grader would tire of the pathetic nonsense that is Movie 43.The plot centers around two teenagers that make up an outrageous picture. However, I've heard it's different for other parts of the world. I'm currently in the UK, so the kids wraparound is what I saw. Their little brother looks for it on the world wide web and ends up finding lots of clips that we get the displeasure of seeing. There's one called \"The Catch\" where Kate Winslet goes on a blind date with Hugh Jackman. However, get this: Hugh Jackman has penises where penises aren't supposed to be! Just hear the crickets sing. I can hear the screenwriter just laughing and laughing as he adds more unfunny jokes about poop and semen.Also, the hilarious basketball sketch where they comment on the fact that basketball players are mostly black! Wow! It's so funny! Naked women and iPads! It's funny too!In short, Movie 43 is a disjointed mess, full of lousy jokes, terrible writing, and actors that no doubt deserve to be in something else. Now, I'm going to rally up Best Actor/Actresses winners to be in my new screenplay, \"Boners of Fire\". Just kidding, of course. I'm not THAT evil.",

Due to the wide range of talent in acting, directing, writing, etc., you really had to work at it to make a movie that was actually worse than \"Plan 9\"....\nWell, it has been done.... not only within the American movie tradition, but with well known and respected Directors and Actors, some of whom have won Academy Awards for their work.... This movie, with all the talent available to it, made in Hollywood, the home of great and glorious movie making, is actually worse than Plan 9 From Outer Space. To many that may sound like heresy, but it is absolutely true.\nI refuse to recall a single scene in it, but let me just say that after Hugh Jackman and Kate Winslet, it all went down hill..... scene after scene of dreck that is SO BAD, that you want to laugh out loud, (and probably would laugh out loud if it wasn't so bad,) but are forced into a sense of extreme horror at seeing some of your favorite actors and actresses debase and humiliate themselves....\nYes, ladies and gentlemen, for Hollywood standards, this is the absolute worst movie ever made....",

The advertising campaign for this film was pretty much just showing everyone all the famous faces that are in it. It was quite clever actually\u0085 pity none of this intelligence came out in the film.The humour in this film is very basic, very childish, very disturbing and very un-funny. Some segments had potential and were funny to start with but then they took it too far. Examples of this are the sketch with Liev Screiber and Naomi Watts and also the segment with Halle Berry and Stephen Merchant. There's toilet humour, jokes about incest (I'm not kidding), jokes about racism and about sex. It's just ghastly. The cinema I was in at the time was fairly busy but people kept leaving throughout the film so by the end about half had gone. It's not a funny film; it's advertised for adults but has the same level of intellect as a goldfish. A lot of actors will have disappointed a lot of their fans here; Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, Liev Schreiber, Kate Winslet, Emma Stone \u2013 they were all respected actors! Why would they do this? Even Johnny Knoxville was too high-brow for this! Apparently a lot of actors tried their best to get out of the project \u2013 Colin Farrell succeeded and was replaced by Gerard Butler. He isn't a terrible let down here as he says yes to any script anyway and has pretty much already sold his soul to Hollywood.Overall, very few people will find this funny; even less will find it really funny. Its toilet humour without the humour\u0085 which makes it just toilet, I guess.",

            "content": "Well, I thought I was prepared for this going in. I had heard about the awfulness of this film prior to watching it, but no amount of negative reviews could prepare me for the sheer terribleness of this cinematic atrocity. I'll admit I'm foolish for letting my morbid curiosity get the better of me, but still, this film is absolutely beyond terrible, no matter which way you'll look at it. I'm sorry to say this, as I know humour is very subjective, but if you come up to me and tell me you absolutely loved this movie, I may just have problems with that. If you get a few desperate chuckles out of it, fine, but if you found yourself laughing constantly throughout then honestly that's worrying. I could name endless comedies that are better than this because I'm struggling to think of any comedies I've seen that are worse than this.This is a film without any sense of structure or coherency. Many will say that's forgivable given that it's a sketch movie comprised of an assortment of different \"stories\" that each represent one step of a gradual decline into comedy hell- where funny things go to die. My main problem with the lack of structure though has to do with the way most of the individual skits are structured- none of them are set up sufficiently. Almost none are well-paced, almost all contain only one joke, and hardly any of them actually conclude. I'm not asking for complex story-telling here, I'm just asking that each skit feels at least somewhat \"complete.\" Look at your average College Humour sketch- they may be a little hit and miss, but at least most of their sketches make sense as far as structure is concerned. Each sketch may only have a couple of jokes, but the start will introduce the joke, then the joke will be built and extended, and then there'll be a final punchline to top things off. I'm not saying that College Humor represent the epitome of comedy, but they know what they're doing, and often their videos are good for at least a chuckle. You're far better off just going through their sketch videos, or hell, almost any Youtube sketch-maker's videos for 90 minutes rather than try to sit through this torturous piece of cinema.Due to the disconnected nature of this pile of excrement, it's hard to talk about this movie as a complete whole; that almost can't be done. There's a \"story-line\" that tries to string together the skits that involves teens apparently discovering these \"outrageous\" videos online, before bringing about the end of the world by bringing them to the public's attention, but it's an abysmal attempt at trying to justify the existence of these god-awful sketches. The stuff in-between the sketches is just as unfunny as the sketches themselves, with the icing on this s***-cake being that the teens don't even react to these videos, which makes this side story feel completely disconnected from the already disconnected and messy skits. This vague attempt at story therefore fails on all levels, and it's really not worth talking about in further detail.Don't let your curiosity get the better of you- this is not a \"so bad it's good movie;\" it doesn't have the entertainment value of something like The Room, Birdemic, or Plan 9 From Outer Space. It's dull, unfunny, crude for the sake of being crude, and soul-crushing. I wasn't ever offended by this material- the movie did shock me, but that was because of the shockingly awful and unfunny nature of its apparent \"comedy.\" How can such immature, pointless humour really offend anyone anyway?This is not \"so bad it's good.\" It's \"so bad it's completely tragic.\" If you see a copy of this movie anywhere, burn it. If you see a downloadable, pirated copy on the internet, burn it onto a disc, and then burn the disc in an act of protest- \"look, I pirated your stupid movie and then I destroyed it!\" If your friend suggests you watch this move, burn him/ her. You'll be doing the world a favour.Shame on all the famous actors that blindly went into this movie without making sure first that it didn't suck. Let's hope they learnt their lesson, and hope that in the future, no other crapfest of this magnitude will ever see the life of day.",

And even though the humor is crass, a lot of it is done in a clever way like the parents homeschooling their child, but also bullying him to give him a full school experience. Or the reason for the ballchin skit being \"a metaphor for the flaws that people create in others so they don't have to take a chance on life and on love\". It's nonstop satirical hilarity.I will say that this movie is for more open minded people. If you like your raunchy comedy in one realm and your Oscar winning actors in another, then you probably won't like this movie.

I didn't have any expectations for this movie, but I didn't know it was going to be this bad. I'm not even going to tell you what this movie is about, because it's just not worth your time. Sometimes a movie is bad, but it's actually fun and entertaining to watch. This isn't one of them. It tries to be funny, and it seems all the budget went to the 'high profile big cast'. This isn't the way to go if you want to make a movie. Either, spend more time and energy in better writing and better jokes. I don't care if the cast isn't high profile actors. Shame on you 'VIRGIN PRODUCTIONS'. Whatever that is. I don't care actually.High profile cast vs bad writing = still a bad movie.The story is a pile of p**p that's too big to flush. They tried to create this frame story that starts with some teenagers. Which eventually leads to a collection of stupid 'shorts' with high profile actors. And it's really a big waste of these actors talents to be in such a movie without any taste in humor. It's like the people from Virgin Productions (seriously who are these guys?) relied too much on this 'cameo surprise' tactic to make a good movie. Well they failed big time. I don't care if you cast the queen of England, President Obama or James Brown back from the dead. At the end of the day, a really bad movie stays a really bad movie whether you have a high profile cast or not. Hopefully this will be a lesson to other movie creators to not spill money and budget to a big cast and just take more time to write a movie worth making.The jokes in this movie: If you are a teenager with a certain taste in p**p, urine, genital related jokes than you just might find this entertaining. But even in this genre of jokes, it's still really, really bad. I actually can enjoy these kind of jokes because I am a perverted old guy who can laugh at a fart or two, but Movie 43 relies too much on the same p**p over and over again.

Unless as it seems you are one of the few who actually enjoyed watching this. I congratulate you and not because you are in the minority, but because you could have fun with a movie like this. Not an easy \"task\".I was warned before watching this, by a few people. I still dismissed their advice and wanted to see for myself. And I actually can say, that I'm stunned on how bad and especially unfunny this is. This has nothing to do with PC or anything. A movie is a movie and if it has some good jokes in it that are offending, I'm all for it. Unfortunately a few rules of good comedy get dismissed here. One of them being, that everyone has to play it straight (and not as comedy). You always do have people in every segment who act differently.It makes all the difference, even though the jokes don't hit home (or anything else for that matter). I can only warn you too, of course, if you haven't already watched this, but beware. This makes \"18-year old Virgin\" look like the Citizen Kane of comedies!I have to put a side note into this: There are two different versions of the \"story\" that holds together the other mini movies. I only have seen the European version of it. From the looks of it, the American version might be better (with Dennis Quaid and others in it). Doesn't mean it is actually better (only saw still frames and a description), but it could be!",

The rest of the movie is a bunch of sketches focusing on testicles, feces, boobs and other stuff that can be funny if done well, but unfortunately it isn't done well here.This movie isn't funny, yeah, I guess you can call that the biggest crime for this supposed comedy. I laughed twice, once at a line by Emma Stone and once during the final skit, everything else either made me gag, or got no reaction from me at all. Speaking of which, the movie is just disgusting, in two ways. One it's jokes rely on bodily functions and human body parts, and half the time I was just looking away groaning. It's also disgusting in how it portrays certain people. Asians, African Americans, People with disabilities, women, hell, even white men will be offended. The acting isn't that great, which surprises me since the cast is filled with a lot of talent. It's mean and overly violent just for the sake of it and makes the film feel less like a comedy. And it doesn't even look that good. I know that the film is supposed to be made of skits that were made by normal people, but everything looks so cheap.Now, like I said I did laugh a couple of times, and some skits do manage to get a smile at points, but they are quickly diminished. And I will give the movie credit that I had no idea where it was going. And I can't really say I was bored, although near the end I was wondering how much time was left.Movie 43 is so bad I didn't even watch the credits with the bloopers and all that. It's offensive, not funny, incredibly mean spirited, and isn't even good on a filmmaking stand point. If you want to watch it to see how bad it is, go ahead, but head this warning, don't eat beforehand.1.5/10",

This is not an artistic attempt to brake taboos but simple desire to capitalize on being controversial even if the controversy rises from the fact that the film is obnoxiously bad. Nothing new in trying to exploit shocking and vulgar subjects on screen and there are many films which would shock you more but Movie 43 is bad not because the vulgar subjects it brings up but because of its tasteless execution.

            "content": "Movie 43 is a comedic disaster in every way shape and form. Even its occasional laughs can best be described as sprinkling powdered sugar on a pile of dead fish. The plot involves\u0085 well there barely is a plot. Basically a crazy writer (played by Dennis Quaid) tries to convince a producer (played by Greg Kinnear in his most embarrassing role since The Last Song) to buy his script involving several \"comedic\" segments. So it comes across as a satire of the movie industry, but it ends up being just as successful as \"An Alan Smithee Film: Burn Hollywood Burn.\"In order to fully express how painfully stupid this movie is, I will now list the worst moments in the film as they pretty much speak for themselves.1. Kate Winslet (playing herself) goes on a blind date with a man (played by Academy Award Nominee Hugh Jackman) who just happens to have a set of testicles hanging from his neck. Pubic hair falls into his soup as he eats it, they get put on a baby's head, and they get dipped in butter. It's like some kind of surreal nightmare. Even if that's what they were going for, it still has no purpose of even existing; it's not even funny.2. A woman (played by Anna Farris) asks her husband (played by Chris Pratt) to defecate on her to show how much he loves her. The movie shows him eating tons of Mexican food and drinking a bottle of laxative (\"poop Viagra\" as the movie so charmingly calls it.) He then has trouble restraining his bowels as his wife begs for foreplay. He makes his wife mad and she storms out into the street. When he follows her, he is hit by a car and defecates all over the street and the windshield. His wife then marvels at how much he defecated, saying it's \"the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.\"3. A man (played by Liev Schreiber) wants to give his homeschooled son a full high school experience. This involves tying his son to a flagpole after writing an insult on his chest with feces. This crossed the boundary between funny and cruel and ended up in the latter by a long shot.4. A woman (played by an attractive Halle Berry) plays a game of truth or dare with a man (played by Stephen Merchant) that involves making guacamole with her bare breast, squirting hot salsa up her vagina, and getting truly awful plastic surgery.5. Josh Duhamel decimates his credibility in a sketch involving a jealous cartoon cat trying to kill his girlfriend (played by Elizabeth Banks) after she catches him masturbating to photos of her boyfriend. The cat pees all over her and Josh Duhamel's character kisses her a little while later as she's covered in urine. And to top it all off at the end, Josh Duhamel's character makes out with the cat in a fantasy sequence. After seeing this, I was actually looking forward to Duhamel's next film: \"Safe Haven.\" Did I mention that when Elizabeth Bank's character tries to fight back against the cat's attacks on her, kids at a birthday party see her attacking the cat and stab her to death? Wonderful\u0085To be fair, three moments gave me a brief laugh.1. Emma Stone's convincing performance in a segment involving dirty- talking at a grocery store.2. The first half of a segment involving a 7th grade girl (played by Chloe-Grace Mortez) having her period and her imbecilic male friend freaking out.3. The second-to-last segment involving Terrence Howard parodying inspirational sports movies like Remember the Titans.That's pretty much it. These on and off moments of humor are far from enough to salvage the film. Not to mention that the main plot of Dennis Quaid's character pitching this movie never really goes anywhere and fizzles out by the end. The whole thing feels so disjointed, and it's attempt to bridge the segments only makes this problem worse.I can't really blame the actors and actresses who were in this; according to several interviews with the lead director himself (Peter Farrely of \"Dumb and Dumber\" and \"The Three Stooges\"), the cast wanted out at sever points during this thing's three year production, but Farrely guilt-tripped them into staying. All in all, this is a crime against comedy and makes me long for the relatively comedic genius of \"Vampires Suck\" and \"A Thousand Words.\"",

            "content": "'Movie 43' is a string of slightly humorous vignettes starring mostly familiar actors from other movies. It reminded me of 'The Kentucky Fried Movie' back in '77. This film feels like an experiment gone wrong, though, and I more than likely will never see any of it ever again. It's a black comedy, but it shoves the gross-out humor to a level where it starts to be very unfunny and particularly mundane and monotonous. There were a few moments of redemption for the audience, but for the most part, it was just awful.To start off, the movie is patchworked into 14 separate segments (not really even short stories) written by relatively unknown writers and a handful of familiar directors. Peter Farrelly is probably the most well-known of the directors, and his trademark physical-makeup work is prevalent in the opening scene with Hugh Jackman and Kate Winslet. I like Bob Odenkirk's as an actor and comedian, but I didn't see any comedy in his directing of his segments with the kids looking for the most banned film in the world. Also actress Elizabeth Banks directed the \"Middleschool Date\" segment, which tries to invoke the comedy behind getting your first period but turns into a confusing car-wreck by the end. I think if they stuck to one or two directors for the whole project, it might've made more sense to have the same vision throughout.The music and camera-work was typical comedic fare, except for (in my opinion, the funniest segment, which was) \"Machine Kids,\" which was shot like a serious PSA in black and white with kids put in disparaging situations, which made me laugh at how sad and screwed-up it was. That segment was an excellent example of how black comedy is supposed to be made. So other than that segment, Halle Berry's \"Truth Or Dare\" segment (really good), and the look on the face of the Riddler during the \"Superhero Speed Dating\" segment, the movie is lacking in any real laughs.'Movie 43' is still better than most of these spoof movies being written by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer ('Date Movie,' 'Meet the Spartans,' 'Disaster Movie'), but it's not worth your time away from sites like FunnyOrDie(dot)com to go see in a theater...or even on DVD. It was made for the comedy historybooks, not for human consumption.",

The skit were these parents are home schooling their son and they tell their new neighbors how they want to 'give their son a real high school experience', is were I lost it. This is insulting to those who choose to home school and degrades the parents role of protecting their children from harm. What happens in the skit is two adults abusing their biological son. They humiliate him on a American flag pole and write dung on his body. They sexually abuse him by forcing him to kiss his mother and sex is hinted to happen next('Do you want to go all the way?' 'Do you have a condom?'). They son becomes so disturbed, he tearfully introduces to the new neighbors his mop girlfriend that has a picture of his mother, as her face, at the end of the skit. They green-lit this scenario? Naomi Wyatt, who plays the mother, should be ashamed of herself. The directors and the people who supported this film (financially or otherwise) should be ashamed too.

The idea of Emma Stone, Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry etc. all in one film had him drooling at the mouth apparently. The all star cast intrigued me, so I quickly looked up some reviews on Rotten Tomatoes. I was promptly told \"RUN\" by these reviews, so I refused to watch the film. However, after persistent nagging, I caved in, having nothing better to do. I knew the flick would be near unbearable, seeing as this friend of mine is a lover of such classics as \"Meet the Spartans\" and \"Disaster Movie\" (Which literally was a disaster by the way), so I smuggled a bottle of vodka into the theater to get me through with less confrontation. And by god, was the movie terrible. Maybe crude humour isn't for me, or maybe this movie just straight up blows. I can't pass a straight judgement seeing as I never get along with these kind of films anyway, and by the end I was a little out of it (I had unintentionally finished the bottle), but I walked out of the cinema with a wretched taste in my mouth. (Once again, that may have been the vodka, not the film) Every scene was redundant and unfunny, and the jokes were made early in the sketches, and then drawn out until they were painfully unfunny. The way they roped so many a-list actors into this utter tragedy is downright appalling. It tried to be offensive from start to finish, and believe it or not, being offensive does not equate to being funny. Although If you told the director this, I'd expect he'd collapse in paralytic shock. Actually this should be \"directors\" because each section was directed by a different person, which makes this even more shameful, seeing as 28 writers and 13 directors couldn't see how redundant and unfunny this thing is. Avoid with your life.I then stumbled home and vomited my guts out.The End.",

No it was never meant to be that. Just to make you laugh and it was funny. If you did not find it funny then I'm guessing you are somebody who still thinks SNL is funny. It's gross out humor. Cmon people the home schooled segment was great. My god relax and take this movie for what it is. Again just different segments that really don't have a point beyond creating humor.

Did none of these fine actors read the script - or at least have agents to do it for them and thus warn them off the project? As it is, I suspect most of these performers will be working overtime trying to expunge this jaw-droppingly awful cinematic turkey from their resumes. I can only imagine that a goodly number of people in Hollywood must have lost careers and jobs over this one.The movie is really just a series of blackout sketches (a la \"Saturday Night Live\"), all written and directed by different artists, held together by the flimsiest of narrative devices: Dennis Quaid plays a gun-wielding, mentally unbalanced screenwriter who invades the office of a studio exec (Greg Kinnear) and proceeds to pitch an idea for a movie that he's convinced will be a bona fide box office bonanza. The labored segments cover such topics as genitalia, scatology, incest - you name it, it's in there. Look, I like dirty jokes and gross-out humor as much as the next fella', but when each attempt lands with a resounding thud, all that's left is the gross-out and the dirty - and you'll probably feel the need for a shower after it's over.

Check out A Haunted House or The Legend Of Hercules. If you still don't believe me, check this out (Or rather, don't). Just when we thought modern comedy couldn't get any worse, we get this: An excruciatingly unfunny, depressing, talent wasting, atrociously executed and tasteless cinematic abomination that's more harrowing than funny. Movie 43 is a collection of the worst and most unfunny skits ever committed to film which happens to be filled with loads of talented actors whose reasons for participating we'll never know. The film is a seemingly endless series of skits involving Hugh Jackman with balls hanging from his chin, incest, toilet humour, sexual jokes, I-pods in the shape of naked women, superheroes turning up in parodies so bad they make Friedberg and Seltzer look like The Naked Gun, periods, swearing leprechauns, a game of truth or dare more disturbing than any horror film, racism and finally a bizarre cartoon cat. Funny right? No! Movie 43 is an almost surreal experience. The film is less funny than Schindler's List, and the awful jokes are introduced, stretched to breaking point, and then they carry on. All 13 of the directors direct the film abysmally, and I've seen better directing from 7 year olds (True story). What's most shocking is that all of the actors, including Kate Winslet, give awful performances. Only Terrence Howard comes away with his dignity intact, in what is easily the best skit of the film. As for the worst, either Hugh Jackman sitting in a restaurant on a blind date with Kate Winslet (Yes, that Kate Winslet) with balls hanging from his chin, or Chloe Grace Moretz (Who has never given a bad performance before) being humiliated in a repugnant periods joke. What is Movie 43? the tagline asks. Is it an experiment to see how we react to watching our favourite actors getting humiliated? Is it a perfect cinematic representation of a dog turd? Is it many bits of hell jumbled up into a vile whole? Or is it actually Peter Farelly's idea of a comedy, despite the fact that it makes Die Hard 5 look like Citizen Kane, it's devoid of laughs, it has the charisma and likability of a sucking black hole and it's a trip down the cinematic toilet bowl that could genuinely made someone throw up. One thing's absolutely sure. It's the worst movie I've ever seen. And I've seen Disaster Movie.0/10",

I have to wonder if this is all some big giant gag because I cannot understand why most of these stars would affiliate themselves with the worst trash I have ever laid eyes on.

I went in because on the good cast and living the history of seeing theatre \"the worst movie of the year\".Basically, if it's not your type, it sucks. In a sketch, they give you one joke, then slaps you with one more of the same tone, then one more, then one more. If you don't get one, you'll hate the rest. And basically saying, most of their jokes sucks. The only reason I gave it a 2 stars is because I liked blue humor, and the basketball it a 5 minutes job of it pretty well. Then again, I paid to see an hour and a half, and got only 5 minutes of goodness, which is pretty dumb. I didn't walk out because of that, and if I have had torrented it, I probably delete it in the first 5 minutes of the movie.To summarized, it sucks; if their jokes don't hit, the movie doesn't, and most of them don't.",

In the morning, a knock on his door reveals Mactaggart, offering a firm handshake and saying, \"They shan't be botherin' ya again Patty.\" The moral of the story is, Hugh, and only Hugh, can prevent florist friars.I tell you this joke because it is infinitely funnier than the entirety of Movie 43.",

Some reviews I read believe the reason people reject it is for the ribald humour. Audiences are willing to be offended if it is funny. There are some good premises, such as Hugh Jackman having a scrotum for a chin. But the joke was drawn out too long, and otherwise the sketch had little else to it. Kind of like a one joke SNL sketch that unfortunately doesn't know when enough is enough. Each sketch suffered from the same lack of depth or follow through. Each sketch also showed lack of professional production, direction, editing, etc. Nevertheless, I HAD to watch this curiosity because of the number of recognisable movie stars it featured. I was quite aghast at the willingness of these worldwide celebrities with an image to protect appearing in infantile crude sketches. See Halle Barry bare her oversized breasts! See Kate Winslet act her way through an embarrassing elongated sketch featuring men's genitalia! Richard Gere objectifies naked women! Each sketch seems to deliberately find something vulgar and then not try at all to expand on the idea. Like the offensive gag is enough to hold the film. Sadly no. This film is so bad but surprising it could qualify as camp/cult. I normally don't give high regard to films that TRY to be camp/cult, because they are too self aware and look for gimmicks they believe will earn cult status. A real cult film believes in itself and only the adoring fans can claim it as such. As for the jaw dropping parade of actors ruining their reputation, one wonders if there was some fine print in their contract that they had to appear in this dreck.",

As it goes on it gets worse and finally at the end it's revealed the entire thing was being filmed as a kind of movie within a movie. End credits. This makes no sense.But there's an alternate version of it. I don't mean it's like an unrated cut and the sketches are all the same and in the same order but this one actually has a narrative that makes sense given what we actually see. It starts off with two guys who want to be internet famous so they film themselves having a load of Jackass type stunts and are getting huge views. Thinking they have it made it's revealed all to be a joke by the younger brother of one of the guys. There is no website, the views are fake, they're not internet famous. So, to get back at him they ask him to find a banned movie only known as \"Movie 43\". As he's doing this they load up his laptop with a bunch of viruses by going to a lot of free porn sites. Although if the younger brother is that smart to create a fake Youtube type website for them, he's smart enough to know how to get rid of viruses. And it's being done on an apple laptop. You know, the ones that are harder to get viruses on?Anyway he finds a bunch of sketches he says are part of this movie and that's what we see. That's the movie. It's not any better as the sketches are all sophomoric crap but it makes sense. Plus the ads we see playing during the movie now make sense I mean when was the last time you watched a motion picture, in a theater or on a DVD and there was an ad in the middle of it? You do see that on Youtube however.This movie is not good. It's really bad. The sketches tend to be really simple with one joke that is then beaten over and over until it's dead. Like the first one. Hugh Jackman is the most eligible bachelor in the city but can't find the right woman. Why? He has balls coming out of his neck. That's the joke. Something that South Park did years ago and this movie stole from them as their first joke. Are you laughing yet? How about the one where Anna Farris and Chris Pratt are a couple and we think they're getting ready to propose to each other. Except Anna wants Chris to poop on her. That's the joke. Are you laughing now? No? Didn't think so. How about the couple that home schools their son but to give him the \"true high school experience\" bully him in the process? If that wasn't bad enough his mother comes onto him. Are you laughing yet? You better not be because that's not funny. It's disturbing.Also the IMDB really needs to work on a way to get rid of fake reviews. Ones that call this a masterpiece and give it 10/10 because they think they're being clever are not helping. Luckily the weighted average seems to show a more accurate rating even though it should be lower.Do not watch this. There is no reason to watch it.",

Things picked up from there, with some monstrous laughs. Each short segment has absolutely nothing to do with the next, and that's what makes it work.Now, that being said, a couple of the segments are stupid, unfunny, gross, and boring. But most of them are a hoot. Talk about random, silly, impossible, hilarious situations. What I will never understand is why people go into a movie like this expecting perfection. This movie does not try in the least bit to be intelligent. It just tries to be funny and entertaining, and for the most part, it succeeds. (With a few exceptions.)Another thing I enjoyed was the use of many talented cast members. It's fun to see these people in a movie that isn't to be taken seriously. I'm sure they filmed their parts in less than a day, and got a laugh out of it. A lot of reviews will tell you it was a waste of talent. In my opinion, everyone needs to goof off and do something silly once in a while.I know my review cites mostly good things about this movie, but my 5/10 star rating is with good reason. While there are many gut-busting hilarious parts to it, the bad parts are so bad, they offset much of the good, and somewhat ruin what could have been an 8 star movie.While Movie 43 will not even come close to winning an Oscar, it deserves more credit than most people give it.",

It looks like they just tried to string together a group of shorts which were originally filmed as a joke. It is just plain stupid. The lack of plot is balanced by a remarkable cast of big name stars. They must have had a huge budget to get all of the big name actors, but this movie drops my opinion of every one of the actors.

Now before I start talking(spoiling) the segments, I must say I didn't pay for this \"film\". There's a segment called \"The Pitch\" and has Dennis Quaid in it and I didn't watch this one. I had an alternate version with a different sketch instead of \"The Pitch\" That's all, now let's dive into this minefield . . .\"The Thread\" - This was the sketch instead of \"The Pitch\" and was the one I got a chuckle at. I don't remember what line it was, but i chuckled. Now this segment is about 3 teenagers who try to find \"Movie 43\" online because it's the most banned film in the world. They piece together the following segments trying to find it. It ends with \"Movie 43\" leading into world destruction. Only one laugh, so yeah. Rating- 0.5/10\"The Catch\" - This one's about Kate Winslet going on a blind date with Hugh Jackman. He's a great and nice guy, but there's a catch - he has a scrotum on his neck. He has a scrotum on his neck and Kate Winslet is shocked and seems to be the only one to see it. That is the whole segment. Kate Winslet being shocked by what Hugh Jackman does with his neck. No laughs, just pain. Rating- 0/10\"Homeschooled\" - Easily one of the most offensive ones. This one's about Leiv Schrieber and Naomi Watts homeschooling there son by humiliating them and also having Naomi Watts give her son his first kiss. Eventually the son becomes a psycho and has a doll who is his only friend. Isn't that HILARIOUS? No, it's offensive and unfunny. Rating- 0/10\"The Proposition\" - Easily the most offensive and disgusting one. Anna Farris wants Chris Pratt to defecate on her. Eventually, he gets hit by a car and his feces go all over the road. Hilarious. Rating- 0/10\"Veronica\" - Kieran Culkin is a convenience store when his ex(Emma Stone) walks in and they talk dirty while the intercom microphone is on. That's it. Stupid. Although, Emma Stone is gorgeous, but didn't deliver anything. Rating- 0/10\"iBabe\" - Richard Gere plays a boss for an Apple rip-off when he finds out that his \"iBabe\" which is an iPod in the shape of a naked woman is destroying male genitalia because the males try to make love with the iBabe. Richard, and his team put barb wire on the iBabe so males won't try to do anything with it, but listen to music. Stupid and unfunny. Rating- 0/10\"Superhero Speed-Dating\" - Justin Long goes speed-dating as Robin from Batman. While speed-dating with women like Lois Land(Uma Thurman) and Supergirl(Kristen Bell) Jason Sudeikis is Batman and keeps messing with Robin's dates. It turns out the Penguin is there and will blow up the place, but they stop him and Robin kisses Supergirl. Offensive to superhero films and comic book fans. Rating- 0/10\"Machine Kids\" - A fake commercial saying that people shouldn't beat machines because there are children in them. Stupid and wasted potential because it's an alright idea. Rating- 0/10\"Middleschool Date\" - This teenager home alone with his brother(Christopher Mintz-Plasse) is on a date with Chloe Grace-Moretz and Chloe gets her first period. The teenager and the brother plus the Chloe's father and the teenager's father(Patrick Warburton) all freak out and don't know what to do, but they do make offensive period jokes. Hilarious and clever? NO! Rating- 0/10\"Tampax\" - Another fake commercial having two women being eaten by a shark and the commercial is for Tampax. So stupid and not clever. Rating- 0/10\"Happy Birthday\" - Seann William Scott is mad at Johnny Knoxville for sleeping with his girlfriend. Knoxville apologizes and captures a leprechaun as a gift for Seann's birthday so they can take it's gold. The leprechaun's brother comes in and tries to rescue him, but Knoxville and Seann kill them. They take the leprechauns' gold and also have a fairy who provides sex. Boring and unfunny. Rating- 0/10\"Truth Or Dare\" - Halle Berry and Stephen Merchant are on a blind date and decide to play a bizarre game of truth or dare. Eventually, they dare each other to get plastic surgery so Berry has a fish face and Merchant becomes Asian. This could have been funny, but it's so stupid and disgusting that it's not funny. Rating- 0/10\"Victory's Glory\" - Set in 1959, Terrence Howard plays a basketball coach for a black team. The team is scared because the other team is white and that's who the audience is rooting for. Howard tells them because they're black, they will win. They lose. Offensive black jokes and just boring and unfunny. Rating- 0/10\"Beezel\" - In the middle of the credits, this segment shows up. Elizabeth Banks is dating Josh Duhamel. Josh has an animated cat who fantasizes about him and Josh together. However, Beezel hates Banks and pees on her and also tries to kill her. The segment ends with Banks trying to kill Beezel, but fails and a bunch of kids stab her with forks. But don't worry, Beezel and Josh are still together. This could have been funny. If the whole segment was animated, it would have been hilarious. The fact that it's real life with this animated cat in it just makes it look like they were too cheap to animate the segment and make it funny. Wasted potential. Rating- 0/10.Overall Thoughts: To end this review, this \"movie\" is awful and deserves no money at all. It's the worst movie I have EVER seen and it's disgusting just to think about this \"movie\". Overall Rating- 0.5/10.",

Had I paid for this movie myself, I would have probably stormed the box office, and demanded my money back.That being said, I appreciated one joke from the whole ninety minute (and thank whatever deity you worship that it's not any longer) run time. It occurred during the Superhero segment, and is so subtle that I was the only one in the theater who laughed at it, and then had to turn and explain it to those I was with as they looked at me weird. That should be an indication.The cast SHOULD be the saving grace of the movie, but instead, you just wonder why they agreed to do something of this caliber. Hugh Jackman is just coming off of a Golden Globe win and is preparing to clinch the win off of his Oscar nomination. He shouldn't need to cash a paycheck that badly that he is willing to don the vulgar prosthetics that he does for the segment. The movie (for film is far too charitable of a designation for this) features a whole myriad of extremely respectable actors and actresses that should not be slumming. The entire budget, I'm sure, was spent on hiring quality talent to mask the complete lack of quality in the movie. It is cinematically boring, and quite awfully written. Anyone who found this movie humorous should be tested to see if they even have an IQ. The jokes come in onslaughts so brutal you would think you were under heavy fire, and it's about as pleasant as that scenario. You will most likely be physically uncomfortable watching it. The level of sexually explicit material and unsavory language is through the roof, and even if you like raunchy, the amount is simply too much. It is unbelievable, some of the things they make light of, and the situations they depict. None of it is witty, or subtly metaphorical, or smart. The worst part is that just when you think it's over, you're wrong. If you have any smidgen of self-respect, please run screaming from the room if you are ever asked to watch it. I would easily say it was the worst movie I have ever had the displeasure to view, and that by the end of it, I was questioning if I was sane enough not to begin clawing my own eyes out. Needless to say, my best friend had his movie-choosing privileges revoked until further notice, as punishment for his decision. Please take my advice, I beg you. Do not watch.",

The ball-chin guy gag was pointless and although it looked funny, I was as confused as Kate Winslet as nobody else ever alluded to it. You might as well just have a photograph of a guy with balls on his neck as nothing ever came of it. It was very childish toilet humour gags which have all been done in some form or other on various cartoons in the past. The central story line was rubbish and boring and a flimsy excuse to tie all these short films together. The guy at the end discovering he had been jacking off to his mother, would have probably jacked off to his mother all his life if his mother was as sexy as that. Poorly done, cheap jokes, and I personally think the big names in this film (apart from Emma Stone and Anna Faris who do every single movie they are offered) were just jumping on the Family Guy band wagon because shock toilet humour dick and fart jokes are \"in\" at the moment.",

Movie 43 is a load of 5 minute sketches in a random order thrown together to make what some people call a movie. I don't call it a movie I call it an abomination. Someone obviously thought this up while drunk or on drugs... (It doesn't matter. Why? because it's a s**t film that's why)! ... and had good enough celebrities in there contacts list to make a film. There are worse movies than this which I have had the misfortune of seeing. But this is the most painful movie I have ever had to watch, i didn't have to watch it I just heard that some people who can be quite funny sometimes were in it. disregarded the extremely bad reviews ( for example this has a 4% on Rotten Tomatoes) and searched Movie 43 Full Movie Online. About 90 minutes later I wished I had watched Jack and Jill instead. Out of the-something like 12 sketches, I don't know how many there are. (Why? Because it's a s**t film that's why)! Out of the 12 sketches i properly laughed at 1! And only because Christopher Mintz Plasse who's Red Mist from Kick Ass was in it. I mean he is a seriously funny guy. And in this one sketch Chloe Grace Moretz is there too, who is Hit Girl in Kick Ass! I'm a huge Kick Ass fan so I hated how they were only in a sketch together to cash in on Kick Ass's success. Another reason why this is a bad film is because it's not funny, all of the jokes are about feces, farts, vomit, urine, sex and even more farts. Well not all of them, there's probably about 5 which are proper non Adam Sandler jokes and aren't totally disgusting. (When I say 5 that's not a definite I didn't stop to count. Why? Because it's a s**t film that's why)! When you use a scatological joke in a movie it's alright if there are other actual jokes to back them up. Like in Superbad they balance toilet humour and clever jokes perfectly so it remains funny. But in this, there are so many stupid (written by 5 year olds) jokes that it's not even the slightest bit amusing. Maybe if you live in a mental asylum and you find stupid jokes absolutely hilarious. Then I strongly recommend this to you, but if you live in the real world with me and the 96% of critics who didn't like this on Rotten Tomatoes then you will hate it.I'll start off at 10 and minus 5 points for all the jokes being stupid and unfunny. Then minus 3 points for Hugh Jackman having balls on his chin. But plus 1 point for Chris Mintz Plasse and Chloe Grace Moretz appearing in the movie. So I give MOVIE 43 (lets just nickname it pile of crap) I give this pile of crap 3/10 and 1.5 stars. Do not watch this unless you enjoyed Jack and Jill and (not or) was hit round the head very hard as a baby. Luke Dobson",

First, I would like to start by mentioning how the movie trailer is very misleading and provides people with false hope and expectations. From public defecation, to having one's testicles on one's neck, and even incestuous relationships are only a few of the many examples of the dark and rather disgusting sense of humor that along with the imagery of the movie create a rather repellent and false portrayal of sex and other universal themes. Additionally, Movie 43 consists of several unrelated scenes that do nothing in terms of both the plot and characters' development of the movie. This movie is so bad that it has the ability to infect one's nerve cells with both aids and cancer, creating a new type of nerve cells that reproduce at an exponential rate and possess the ability of causing one's IQ level to drop dramatically. If you don't want to waste your precious time and intelligence, then listen to what I and many others have to say about this movie and simply don't waste your time watching it. Every user that claims that this movie is nothing else but absolute rubbish is telling nothing else but the honest truth. There is this saying that seems very appropriate given the main message that I am trying to convey; \"Curiosity killed the cat\". This saying serves as a warning declaiming to not let your curiosity get the best of you! A great number of people, myself included have fallen prey into this very trap and have made the very mistake of disregarding many of the wise reviews proclaiming that this movies is complete balderdash as it lacks plot development and many more elements crucial to a movie's reputation and watch-ability. Just like Plato, a well known Greek Philosopher said: \"A wise person learns from his mistakes! A wiser one learns from others' mistakes!\" I hope this review came in handy and opened your eyes to the harsh reality that is Movie 43. I wish each and every one of you the best of luck!!!

Apparently Hollywood was having a \"Bring Your Kids to Work\" day, and they let the munchkins write their own little scripts and let 'em run wild with the cameras.

The skits are VERY vivid dramatizations of the kinds of dirty jokes teens and old guys tell each other. The other difference is that all of the skits feature big-name stars.It is gross-out humor.

            "content": "I have a weakness for movies like The Kentucky Fried Movie and Amazon Women on the Moon. Big huge paens to MAD Magazine stupidity, they're the cinematic equivalent of Fiddle Faddle to me.Then there's Movie 43, a movie that took a decade-long odyssey to get made, as most studios rejected the script. The end result was shot over a several year period and included some actors who refused to appear and others, like Richard Gere, who worked hard to escape the project.Movie 43 was the brainchild of Charles B. Wessler, whose career goes from starting way down here as a production assistant on the film Can I Do It... 'Til I Need Glasses? - suddenly this is all making sense - and ends up all the way up here by producing Green Book.Wessler then recruited three pairs of directors - South Park's Trey Parker and Matt Stone, Something About Mary's Peter and Bobby Farrelly, and Airplane!'s David and Jerry Zucker - to make a third of the movie each. Yet weeks before shooting, writers Parker, Stone and the Zuckers backed out. The film ended up with thirteen directors and nineteen writers.That said - the movie did make money. $32.4 million on a $6 million dollar budget, yet you have to consider that every single actor was working for scale. Therefore, we can't even comprehend the true budget of this film.What we can calculate is the vitriol and hatred that critics heaped on the film, crowned by it winning worst director, worst picture and worst screenplay at the 34th Golden Raspberry Awards.Peter Farrelly directed the wrap=around story - as seen in the U.S. cut of the film - called The Pitch. Here, a writer not so subtly named Charlie Wessler (Dennis Quaid, and no, I'm not saying \"who deserves better\" because honestly, everyone involved in this movie deserves better and willingly made this movie) pitches his movie to producer Griffin Schraeder (Greg Kinnear). Somewhere in all of this, Common, Charlie Saxton, Will Sasso and the gigantic dome of Seth MacFarlane all appear.Movie 43 feels like MAD TV the movie. You remember that show? It was the original home of Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele. And all I remember is that the audience would be reacting to the show as if Jesus himself had walked out on set, yet nothing funny ever really seemed to happen. Seeing Sasso in these segments - he was also on the show before he turned his John Madden impression into an industry - reminds me of just how grating those shows were.In the U.K. and the Netherlands, another wrap-around called The Thread posits a world where Movie 43 is the most dangerous film ever made and its discovery destroys civilization. We should all be so lucky. Fischer Stevens shows up, thankfully not as a culturally inappropriate character such as the one he played in Short Circuit, but then again, with bad taste being thrown at you for this movie's entire running time, why they didn't go this route is beyond me.Next is The Catch, which was the scene that was filmed to convince other actors to be in the film. There's one joke: Hugh Jackman has balls on his chin. Somehow, Kate Winslet is in this as well, getting paid around $800 for a role that by all rights would have decimated careers in the past.In Homeschooled, Liev Schirber and Naomi Watts homeschool their child but take it too far. I wish I could tell you there was another joke, but nope. That's the joke.Steve Carr, who fostered such cinematic turds as Dr. Dolittle 2 and Paul Blart: Mall Cop onto screens everywhere as if they were commodes, brings the fecal-obsessed story The Proposition, in which Chris Pratt and Anna Ferris (who were a couple at the time) basically take a dump upon one another.Some day, I'm going to have a chat with Griffin Dunne about making Practical Magic, a movie that I have suffered through numerous times. I'm also going to discuss Veronica, the next segment, whereupon Kieran Culkin and Emma Stone graphically discuss their sex life in a rundown grocery store.Steven Brill, who was the hatchet man called in to reshoot the movie Fanboys by Harvey Weinstein, directed the next sequence called iBabe. Yes, the force that made Little Nicky is here to do an overly long sketch about a robot girl (Kate Bosworth) whose internal fans cut off penises. This is probably the most embarrassing thing Richard Gere has ever done, I said, ignorant of the veracity of that urban legend.Superhero Speed Dating has Justin Long and Jason Sudekis as Batman and Robin, trying to woo Kristen Bell as Supergirl, Uma Thurman as Lois Lane and Leslie Bibb as Wonder Woman. It's a marvel of restraint and timing compared to the rest of the movie.Machine Kids is a throwaway about kids who get stuck inside machines.Elizabeth Banks directed the next part, Middleschool Date, which is a period piece. No, really, it's a drawn-out tale of menstruation starring Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Chloe Grace Moretz and people who only two names like Jimmy Bennett, Patrick Warburton and Matt Walsh.Have you ever wanted to watch Johnny Knoxville and Seann William Scott beat up a leprechaun played by Gerard Butler? Then you must be Brett Ratner and you made the next story, Happy Birthday.Truth or Dare involves, well, truth or dare between Halle Berry and Stephen Merchant. You know, this week of failures has two Halle Berry movies in it. This one somehow beats out Catwoman, which speaks so, so much about this movie.Victory's Glory is directed by Rusty Cundieff, who turns in a cute tale of an all black basketball team against a team of all white guys. Terrence Howard makes it work.Elizabeth Banks and Josh Duhamel are in love, except Josh's cat won't have her in the house in the final story, Beezel. It's animated and James Gunn directed it, but somehow didn't even get to edit the movie.There were some scenes cut, like Bob Odenkirk's Find Our Daughter, which has Tony Shaloub and Julianne Moore as the stars and The Apprentice, a movie in which a mortician has sex with a corpse and brings her back to life. Anton Yelchin, who died before his career could go past the Star Trek films, was in this segment.Comedy is a touchy subject. Not every joke lands. But man, never have so few jokes landed so never, as they don't say. I saw this in the theater and while I laughed at some of the incredulous moments, it soon turned into a clock watching affair. Then again, it was a forced fun team bonding work experience, which never lends toward enjoyment. Subsequently, viewings have only made me dislike this movie so much more.",

            "content": "The first question that comes to mind is \"Why was this movie made?\" Perhaps the obvious answer is \"Money\", but there's maybe 10 minutes of worthwhile viewing in the almost 90 minutes of running time. I found this one at my local public library, I usually see whatever they buy, but I would never recommend this to any of my friends. With stars like Dennis Quaid, Greg Kinnear, Hugh Jackman, Kate Winslet, and many others, you would expect it to be at least a good movie, if not great. But no, it is just one dirty scene after another, some of it sexy dirty, some of it body function dirty. Would a girlfriend really want you to \"poop on her\" to validate your love? Quaid is a desperate wanna-be movie maker and he is pitching ideas to producer Kinnear. We see the pitches acted out in a series of \"shorts.\" The first is a blind date (Winslet and Jackman) that seems ideal, but as they arrive at their restaurant table and he takes the scarf off his neck, it is revealed that he has a full-size scrotum hanging, in plain view, right below his chin. Everyone knows him, it seems to be no big deal, but his date has a hard time processing what she is witnessing. Very inventive and funny.The other funny scene was \"Superhero Speed Dating\" where Robin and Lois Lane are meeting up, but Batman shows up to spoil everything, especially when he phones Superman, who shows up in the blink of an eye. Supergirl shows up later. That one was also inventive and funny. As were the fake commercials showing that machines, like ATMs, cola vending machines, and office copiers actually have small children inside to dispense whatever comes out of the machine. But so much of it was just \"dirty\" for the sake of being dirty and that spoiled most of the scenes.",

The segments are stories being pitched by Dennis Quaid to producer Greg Kinnear.The first main segment has Hugh Jackman with his scrotum hanging off his neck. HA HA HA! You're suppose to laugh at this sight gag from Peter Farrelly. Why? I'm not sure.The second segment has Liev Schreiber and Naomi Watts homeschooling Jeremy Allen White.The third one has Anna Faris asking boyfriend Chris Pratt to poop on her. At least in this one, it is interesting to see some husband and wife chemistry from the usually funny actors.The fourth has Emma Stone battling verbally with grocery store clerk Kieran Culkin. It's curious for about 2 minutes and then the mannerisms get tiring.There are segments of iBabe about music players that look like naked models. It is about the least funny use of hot girls.Super Hero Speed Dating has Justin Long as Robin trying to do speed dating and encounter various other comic book characters. This is probably the one with the most potential. The direction just needs to be better. This was almost good.Then there is the fake PSA where kids are in everyday machines doing the work. Not funny and boring.Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz is making out with Jimmy Bennett only to be interrupted by his brother Christopher Mintz-Plasse. Then she starts to have her period. Like so many other segments, this is an one joke premise being stretched way too thin. It could be a funny joke in a better movie. Here it is a cute moment that the actors flail around to try to keep the moment going.Happy Birthday has Johnny Knoxville has captured leprechaun Gerard Butler for Seann William Scott's birthday gift. I think this would be better as a Tale from the Crypt.Halle Berry and Stephen Merchant are on a blind date and they start playing truth or dare. It has a charming rom-com feel to the beginning but turns into tired ridiculous territories.Victory's Glory is a 1959 segment of an all bad basketball team playing an all white team. Terrence Howard plays coach Jackson. It's very repetitive.Then there is a final segment with an animated cat called Beezel. The movie has nothing left and this is just beating a dead cat.The disjointed nature of the movie takes away any way to built any relationships or discover the characters' nature. This is simply shock humor for the sake of shock humor. In the end, the shocks are boring and the humor is lacking.",

The problem wasn't that it was a sketch movie - there are sketch movies that are pretty good, see, e.g. Kentucky Fried Movie. The problem wasn't with the crudity, as there have been crude movies that aren't bad. The problem, really, is with the scale of the crassness and crudity. It's brazen, and not in a humorous way. The writing fails, the jokes fail, the acting fails (though Winslett does do well with what passes for the material she's given). The movie is rife with scatological and fellatious \"humor,\" which leaves you wondering why, exactly, you are sitting here watching this dreck. I found myself wondering if there was any redeeming piece to this movie, and, with the exception of Kate Winslett's efforts, and Terrence Howard as a 1950's basketball coach, which is why this movie gets 2/10 from me, there is nothing in this movie that really can be argued as quasi-quality.Avoid at all costs.",

Those of you that remember \"The Kentucky Fried Movie\" style of short skits and that genre of comedy may make the same mistake of going to see this movie thinking it's going to be something along those lines. It's not. It's not even close. One positive thing is how they managed to get so many big name actors on-board to perform in the skits is pretty amazing. Had the directors found a better way to tie everything together it might not have been so bad. In the movies defense however there were some genuine moments of laugh out loud funny.

Also,a good rule of thumb: do not see a movie where the top three words to describe it are the following: shame, embarrassment, and gross-out.

            "content": "Movie 43 is really not your typical comedy. It starts very aggressively immediately giving a shock to audience with some of the most insane scenes involving top Hollywood actors ever shown in cinemas (Hugh Jackman scene is the one I am talking about). All jokes here are Very aggressive and some sweet girls (or boys) would definitely find themselves unprepared and may even leave the cinema. Movie 43 contains short unconnected stories (what we could derive from trailer), which use different typical social settings. Each story is filled with jokes that may appear to be \"out of boundaries\" or \"too stupid/harsh\" or something to someone who is willing to only look at them this way. However while you are laughing your a#$ off or thinking \"omg did they really say that\" (depending on how you choose to perceive this movie) it is important not to forget to be thinking about each story, and actual idea or message behind it. Two things that are common about stories is that they cover some challenging but well known to anyone social topic and that they use a lot of dangerous jokes and 18+ words/scenes. I believe most important topic of movie 43 skit is approach to tolerance and some \"real\" principles of \"good\" and \"bad\", definitions which become more and more blurry as we move in 21 century. With the right words mass media can help its audience to view any problem from desired angle, essentially making black white and vice versa. Here we can see that there definitely has to be a limit to acceptable, allowed or reasonable behavior and some things actually are not acceptable, should not be allowed or tolerated. When you try to challenge someones view on those topics usual words may not be enough due to depth of someones beliefs, but artistic instruments from Movie 43 arsenal can actually deliver those messages in a very clear and straightforward manner.All in all Movie 43 will definitely split audience. Some will say that they have never seen more stupid, \"shit humor\" comedy, while others will really enjoy the form and elegance and actual wit and depth of the movie.It probably wouldn't work at all if those star actors weren't there, people would simply not watch it past couple of scenes.I suggest people who go to watch Movie 43 to open their mind a little bit, prepare to be challenged at some of their core values and have some really good time. If you aren't ready to look for forest behind the trees you probably wouldn't enjoy it.Its definitely an outstanding movie and there aren't many like it around so I really think it is a must see.",

Slightly humorous and watchable, although it becomes tiresome! Second sketch is about two people saying something together but one says something bizarre. Is it some hill billy misunderstanding, a play on words? Nope it's not and starts setting a trend.The third sketch about home schooling starts off fairly funny but they take it too far. It's simply not funny at the end and the downward trend continues! The super hero dating could be brilliant but when Lois starts talking about superman's explosive man muck, it sets the tone! The only funny bit is where supergirl talks about Batman hiding under the table, ruined by pointless text about her nether regions! Ibabe sketch was pointless, could have been funny but ruined by the desperate need to show naked women bits.The last sketch in which we walked out after was the young girl having her first period. Yes I see what they tried to do but it wasn't funny at all!! The film claimed to offend but it wasn't... Jimmy Carr is offensive! You could see the 'funny' situations in each sketch but every time it was ruined by the need for vulgarity, crassness and nudity. If you were a 12 year boy who finds poo, boobies and lower girlie parts funny then they will prob enjoy this. I am 35!",

Rated R For Srong Pervasive Crude And Sexual Content Including Dialouge, Graphic Nudity, Language, Some Violence And Drug Use.1hr 37min/97min.73 uses of the F-word.What is it that makes critics turn away in disgust at Movie 43? Is it because it's not funny? Is it because it's vulgar? Is it because it's tasteless? Yes. Critics turn their noses at this film because they can't have fun. I went into this film expecting nothing but pure garbage. When I came out I was pleasantly surprised. The film is a sketch comedy film. People often compare it to The Kentuckey Fried Movie, Amazon Women On The Moon and The Groove Tube. However the way critics are treating it remind me of a terrible sketch comedy film from 1999 called The Underground Comedy Movie. That film had terrible sketches that felt like work to sit through. This film makes me feel joy-us that I sat through it. Is it a perfect movie? No. But it is a fun movie to sit down and have a good laugh.The film has a wraparound story to tie all of these sketches together. This is called \"The Pitch\". Charlie Wessler (Dennis Quaid) is an aspiring screen-writer. He takes his new script to Griffin Schraeder (Greg Kinnear) and pitches him his script which are the sketches in the film. When Griffin doesn't want to listen to his script anymore, Charlie pulls out a gun and threatens to kill him unless he listens to the rest of his script. If you live outside of the United States, then you got a sketch called \"The Thread\". This features a group of three teenage boys who want to search for the most banned film ever made, following the 43rd rule of the internet which is, \"You can find anything you are looking for as long as you keep looking\". The first sketch is called \"The Catch\". Beth (Kate Winslet) is going on a blind date with the city's most eligible bachelor Davis (Hugh Jackman). Ther's only one problem. Davis has a scrotum hanging from his neck, to which only Beth acknowledges.\"Homeschooled\" has a group of parents (Naomi Watts and Leiv Scheiber) Who feel that their homeschooled son (Jeremy Allen White) is not in a normal high school environment unless he has all of the negative aspects rolled right in. \"The Proposition\" Features Anna Faris who wants her boyfriend (Chris Pratt) to defecate on her because she is a coprophilliac. \"Veronica\" has Veronica (Emma Stone) having a loud, rude and vulgar conversation with her ex-boyfriend Neil (Kieran Culkin) over the intercom of Neil's store. \"The Proposition\", By the way has a very ending, if you know what I mean.\ufeffIn \"iBabe\" Richard Gere plays the head of a company that makes a music player in the form of a naked woman. However they have problems with it when boys try to have sex with it and get hurt due to a fan in the womans (whistles). They decide to move the vent to the ear. \"Superhero Speed Dating\" has Batman (Jason Sudekis) and Robin (Justin Long) are at a speed dating event to try and defuse a planted bomb. \"Middleschool Date\" Has a boy (Jimmy Bennet) and a girl (Chloe Grace Mortez) on their first date. But the date goes awry when the girl starts having her period and neither the boy, his brother (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) or his father (Patrick Warburton) Know the proper thing to do. In \"Happy Birthday\" Pete (Johnny Knoxville) gets a leprachaun (Gerard Butler) for a birthday present to his buddy Brian (Sean William Scott) But alls not well when the Leprachauns brother (also Gerard Butler) shows up.In \"Truth Or Dare\" Halle Berry and Stephen Merchant are playing a game of Truth Or Dare to make themselves more comfortable, but the game rapidly gets out of hand. \"Victory's Glory\" Has a basketball coach (Terrence Howard) coaching his all black team to victory in the year of 1959. The last sketch is called \"Beezel\" which has a 2D animated cat getting in the way of the relationship of Elizabeth Banks and Josh Duhamel. The film has a lot of jokes that hit but the humor in the film is questionable. I love films that take risks and is a big, giant \"Screw You\" to Hollywood. Actors can get stereotyped. This film proves that actors can be vulgar yet funny while doing it.",

At a very few circumstances one may suspect that the movie twists into some form of coherence, but all of a sudden it goes back to the no-sense premise.However, I honestly could not stop laughing throughout the entire film.This is with no doubt, a ridiculous movie, but it's not bad made. It serves its purpose perfectly. At no time the movie tries to distance itself from the absurd. Beholding the greatness of this absurdity, one waits desperately for the movie to provide a coherent explanation. But this explanation never comes. This is why this delirious comedy is a success.Most reviews are all-out mortifications of this movie that try to find sense and coherence, when the whole point is that there isn't any.

We were hoping for that kind of funny. But there was very little that was funny in this show. It was very uncomfortable to watch and more than a little sad that actors of such name were involved in it. Don't Waste Your Money!!!!",

We couldn't rent it so we had to buy it but we thought it looked so funny we would watch it again so why not? Paid $15 dollars for 90 minutes of crap. It didn't tie together and i understand that was the point of it but I there was no sign of that in the trailer at all. I will admit some parts were funny but we didn't understand most of it and all the parts that were funny were already in the trailer. I am very surprised all of those stars were in it.

People should just watch it for the shock factor, which doesn't necessarily mean that all of the sketches are good, but they are definitely something that you haven't seen before. I am amazed that actors like Richard Gere, Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry etc, actually agreed to do the movie because, as a whole, the film is quite silly and immature. I mist admit, I did laugh at some of the sketches but you do have to take the movie lightly to get it. The whole concept of why they are looking at the sketches, is ridiculous but you can't fault it's originality. You will be playing some of the sketches to your friends just to see there faces, which is why I gave it a couple of stars, even though its completely crazy. Strange!Round-Up: I must admit, I was anxious to see this movie because I didn't understand how they were going to put the cast together, but after seeing the Hugh Jackman & Kate Winslet mad sketch, I knew what road the whole movie was going to take. There are a lot of takes from other movies, which you have to watch out for, and the bonus sketch on the DVD is worth a watch. In all, you really have to watch it to get it because a movie review is not big enough to explain the madness in the film.Budget: $6million Worldwide Gross: $30millionI recommend this movie to people who have a warped sense of humour and the like movies that are built up by various sketches. 2/10",

I would also like to praise the unique idea of how this film was formatted into a bunch of segments. I'm not sure if that worked out entirely though. As for these segments, some were great and funny. But others were just plain awful and very disgusting. My favorites were the homeschooled and the middle school shorts as well as the leprechaun short. But I despised most of the others especially the robin/batman one and the Hugh Jackman one.As mentioned earlier, this film is just a bunch of segments running together. There isn't much of a plot, but it seems like it's about a guy who went to a movie exec to pitch his movie, but this movie very offensive and something no one has ever seen before.I have no idea how they managed to get this kind of cast for this kind of film. I guess it was cool watching many of these A-listers make fools out of themselves for an hour-and-a-half, but eventually it does grow old.Overall, Movie 43 doesn't live up to it's incredibly negative hype, but it's nothing to bring home. I managed several chuckles and even some full blown-out laughs. I liked how this film managed to push boundaries and I found it gleefully offensive, but perhaps it went a little off the deep end. But for every good laugh in this film, there are two or three awful jokes and that's not good. But then again, it could have been worse. I rate this film 6/10.",

For zamplers, did the megashark bite the girl on the left in the black swimsuit in half cuz she was wearing some brand other than tampax that still leaked, or was tampax trying to do one of those pubic service announcements telling customers that if they had any OLD tampax they had better to get rid of them before gointa swim in any oceans where there might be sharks an such, seeing as how the older models were prone to leaking, in tampaxes official view (now that they have the newer ones available; slogan \"tampax: they no longer leak)? It said in the credits at the end of this show (and i mean the credits that come AFTER Elizabeth Banks tries to kill her husband's pet cartoon cat, which was about 15 minutes of MOVIE 43 that 8 of the 11 people at my showing MISSED, cuz there was 5 minutes of credits and THEN the movie started up again with no warning from the theater cleaner-uppers or anyone!) that there were 2 product placement people for MOVIE 43, which I assume means this is a REAL message from the tampax people they want to get out there to save some girls in real life (and ta sell more plugs, of course).P.S.--Does anyone know where to watch the first 40 movies in this series?",

The movie, is actually not really a movie at all, but a collection of sketches that have no connection with each other. Some are better than others, some cruder than others, but they all made me laugh to some extent. All of the sketch ideas are original, I'm sure you will never have seen them before. I'm not even going to attempt to describe the them, as the shock value is one of the best things about them. All I will say, is the that some of them rely pretty heavily on 'toilet humor' and 'gross out value' and one sketch in particular is pretty bad taste - but still funny.

            "content": "Movie 43 is the one of the number one, if not the number one, movies that leaves pondering the questions of why so many talented actors of the A-list category to commit themselves for something so abhorrent and exceedingly tasteless as this. This film succeeds as one of the cinematic entities that feels far more like a contest to see far these actors could reach in the level vileness than a coherent story. Everything that transpires within this hour-and-half project is an endless barrage of absurd vulgarity and an unflinching approach at over-the-top gross-out humor, with no efforts on actually making it funny. With the Farelly brothers, Elizabeth Banks, Steven Brill, and many others serving in the director's office, the movie is as raunchy and vulgar as many R-rated comedies go. But it all contributes for the purpose of drenching audiences in its endless shock value, and not for laughter. This film follows an anthology of shorts following the misadventures of a cast including Hugh Jackman, Kate Winslet, Liev Schreiber, Naomi Watts, Emma Stone, Kieran Culkin, Chloe-Grace Moretz, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Seann William Scott, Gerard Butler, Johnny Knoxville, Hallie Berry, Chris Pratt, Anna Faris, along with other many talented actors who thought were apparently coaxed into committing to this dumpster fire. This series of shorts are presented by a Hollywood screenwriter (played by Dennis Quaid) who tries pitching his scripts to a Hollywood producer (played by Greg Kinnear). But when the producer (unsurprisingly!) rejects his ideas, Quaid goes to extreme measures to convince him to greenlight his projects, one of which involves holding him at gunpoint. This movie, telling a story in a vignette-style that echoes such works like 'Kentucky Fried Movie', suits as the epitome of balls-to- the-walls trashy and offensive to every degree. To add insult to injury, it is quite hard to believe someone would have a fun sitting through the end of this before walking out counting how many brain cells were depleted. That's right! This movie is actually that dumb. Although it is horrifying difficult to determine who would compelled to see things like Kate Winslet going out on a date with Hugh Jackman who has a male scrotum on his chin, Naomi Watts share an incestuous first kiss with her teenager son, Chloe-Grace Moretz plunge into a ridiculous debacle over her first period, Emma Stone and Kieran Culkin engage in a repulsive sexual conversation, or Anna Faris asking her boyfriend to, ahem!, defecate on her; it grows abundantly clear that the directors and writers have zero care of how vile the humor gets and how far they push the boundaries with an excess of toilet jokes, penis jokes, and other such gross-out gags before viewers grow brain-dead. As a whole, the entire story is just embarrassing. While television shows like 'South Park' and 'Family Guy' are no strangers to pushing the envelop with their humor, there is at least sense of cleverness and smart lying beneath the raunchiness, whereas here; these actors only aim to shock value while letting their efforts at evoking laughter crumble to the ground. Seriously, how ugly can you get away with splashing moviegoers with such rancid humor? Come on Hollywood! You are better than that. And the same should be said all of these actors. None of them are funny, none of them are charming, and most importantly, none of deserve to subject themselves to this sort of abuseMovie 43 is a vile, unfunny comedic misfire that boasts no value for laughter and plunges cinema-goers in 94 minutes of lifeless abuse. It is more than safe to say that is marks the absolute low point of every single actor, especially the Oscar winners, in his and her career. There is only thing Movie 43 accomplishes, and that is wiping the bottom of the barrel of cinema.",

This feels like there was a deep ulterior motive when all this ensemble of top notch actors, writers and directors, decided to make this seemingly extreme raunchy version of a comedy movie. After laughing non-stop for the duration I'm remembered of one thing that contributes to your overall physiological and psychological health: being able to laugh at yourself and to not take yourself too seriously. Maybe that was the point, or maybe the whole thing was born out of a dare or a bet, one thing that's obvious to me at least is that I'm sure EVERYONE involved in making this flick, thoroughly enjoyed the process, and for some of those with star status, I'm almost certain, it had been a while since they'd been able to work without as much pressure to deliver, pressure even from themselves as they are not known to have a comedy background or had worked in a comedic film whatsoever. Read some of the critiques by \"professionals\" from various publications across, and could not find one who tried to consider such a perspective on this film. Some of these people in here have gone to great lengths to write this lengthy essays on how disgusting and filthy and on and on, my question is: what the hell did you watch the whole movie for if, in fact, you were so outraged and revolted by it? I think asking a similar question does tend to uncover a lot of the latent intrinsic motives and reasons behind most of the rhetoric behind most of the online, print, or publishing of any kind, nowadays. Hey, if it makes you laugh as hard as it did me, then put on some slippers and enjoy, otherwise, someone taking the time and being so passionately and vehemently inclined to criticize ANYTHING, points, to me at least, to a seated dark issue more within themselves than with the target of their banter.",

I happend to find a unopened Blu-ray of it at Salvation Army yesterday, so I bought it and watched it before bed, out of curiosity.Movie 43 is a bizarre movie, that's for sure. It focuses on Dennis Quaid pitching a skit film to Hollywood, and he makes different producers hear the script. People sit in horror at his ideas, which include but are not limited to:*Chloe Grace Moretz getting a period on a date around some idiotic boys.*Kate Winslet on a blind-date with Hugh Jackman, who has his neck, unbeknownst to others.*Parents bullying their child that they home-school.*A staff meeting on the IBabe, an IPod that looks like a nude woman, which teen boys use for sex and get their privates mangled in.*A couple plan to defecate on each other for a date, but things don't go as planned.These are 5 examples of the 13 skits that this film contains. If you are already turned off by this movie, then you will most likely loathe it. But if you had a long day at work like I did, or you just need something silly, Movie 43 may be the movie you need.Look, Movie 43 is not great. It's no Blazing Saddles or Airplane! and it definitely should not be compared to Citizen Kane by any means. Some of the skits are gross(like the defection one), so I didn't love all the skits, but I got some ironic enjoyment out of watching it.If you hate it, I understand, and to an extent I actually agree. But with the right mindset, this is a movie you could laugh at with friends-at the quality, not so much the jokes.Like my title states,this movie is self-aware of how bad it is. When Dennis Quaid pitches some skits, people turn him down, wondering WHO WOULD SIT THROUGH THIS MOVIE HE WANTS TO MAKE? Get the joke? WE are watching his train-wreck of a movie. But no one wants to MAKE it! That's partly why this kind of worked for me.Sure there are 42 movies that are better than Movie 43. But compared to trash I've witnessed, like Night Patrol, I would prefer this.Hate on this critique all you want. I didn't care for the poop skit or the intercom one much, but I enjoyed the period and blind date skits. I'm sorry, have mercy on me. I'm sure there are times I would watch this and hate it, but I watched it with a proper mindset and enjoyed it.I thought this would be terrible. I changed my mind. You can take it or leave it.

I remember some time ago, I read about a famous french or Italian artist that sold his sh*t. My point is that this movie has such a high rating not because of quality or meaningfulness, but because of the great artists(that BTW don't do anything worthy of their performance) that participate. And just as the artist was able to sell his sh*t, just because it's HIS famous as* sh*t, the same way the actors managed to sell us their sh*tty movie(no pun intended). Sometimes when you try to send a message all you do is put pressure on yourself, and put some more, and more, until you fart, and you end up a little bit empty and dead inside. The Idea is quite clear and understandable, however trying so hard to be grotesque and actually succeeding at it, means that in the end you are contributing to what you are fighting against. And this motion picture is great at it. I remember a movie called Idiocracy, or something like that, that was actually a good kind of provocation. This one right here is more likely contributing to the social reality of the for-mentioned title. The worst part was when the credits rolled in. You are relieved it's over and you can go home and forget about what happened. But NOOO, you must continue being a subject of the twisted mind of the makers of this repulsive movie. You must watch a yet another short that's disgusting and just plain bad. At this point you really want it to just end and forget about it, run outside and kill somebody, just to do something, anything else than see another second of this movie.

No really story. I love that in a movie. You don't find it very often. It can either be done very well (The Onion Movie) or very poorly (The Underground Comedy Movie). So, because I like those kinds of movies, I actually thought Movie 43 looked kind of fun.Then, the reviews came out. And the critics tore it to shreds. They called it one of the worst movies of all time. So once I heard of this, I knew I had to see it. It was in theatres for maybe a week, then it was gone. It's July now, and I've finally seen it. I am one of the few whose seen it. I survived Movie 43. I don't think it's one of the worst movies ever, but it was bad. I love movies like this, and I hated this one.Again, this is a sketch comedy without a plot. There is sort of a plot but I didn't get it. One sketch involves a blind date between Kate Winslet and Hugh Jackman, and Jackman has a ballsack on his chin. O-kay then... Anyways, the best sketch in with Liev Schreiber and Naomi Watts where they give their home schooled son a taste of teen life. They bully him, they teach him, and even hit on him. That one is very over-the-top but yet it actually worked. But those aren't even the worst ones. There is one where Anna Faris asks Chris Pratt to poo on her. There's another where Chloe Moretz has her period and everyone finds out about it.There are three, maybe four sketches (out of probably 15) that I actually sort of liked. The rest of them are either strange, disgusting, repulsive, or creepy. Some of them have good ideas, but like most, none of the jokes ever seem to take liftoff. The idea just works. It's sad that when you gather 13 filmmakers (including Griffen Dunne and Elizabeth Banks) and nearly 30 writers, this is the best you can come up with. Also, it feels like every one of the filmmakers is trying to outdo each other in repulsion. It's pathetic.It's hard to believe that a movie like this could even get made. How are all of these famous people in this movie? How did they get Oscar winners and nominees on board? Were they all blackmailed? Or were they just bored? If it wasn't for the few skits that sort of worked, this would be a truly terrible movie. Instead, it's just bad. Not just bad, but also sad. One of the worst movies of the year so far.

            "content": "Not sure why this movie had such incredibly low ratings.Granted, I saw the three teenagers version and thought it was the weakest piece of the entire movie. I wish I had seen the one with Quaid and Kinnear, actually.I hate to say that this movie is misunderstood, but I see no other way to put it.I also don't see how the shock factor was too high and turned people off because by movie history standards, we have seen much worse in the disturbing department.So I'm left to think that reviewers were expecting something they didn't get.Movie 43 is closer to a movie like Holy Motors in which the completely abstract approach to the various parts of the movie correlate to a package that is either appealing or not.Consequently, trying to explain why it appeals to you or not is futile considering how completely over-the-top most of the parts turn out to be.It's also why it is most hilarious to see the various critics and reviewers pointing out the type of humour and how it was repulsive to them, while not really talking about the actual movie itself. It was interesting to see how some of the actors carried the various sketches on their shoulders. I even thought Emma Stone's bit was a pretty fine piece of comedic acting, actually.Why it was funny for people to see Cameron Diaz smear semen in her hair and unfunny to see Hugh Jackman going on a date with a scrotum attached to his chin is puzzling, to say the least.It reminded me of Forehead Tittaes with William Fichtner and Marion Cotillard which gathered a surprising 6.6 rating despite being about women walking around with breasts protruding from their heads.I wasn't exactly amused by every sketch in the movie either, but all of the sketches had something memorable in them.While not necessarily that funny, the iBabe part was a witty parody of how an entire board of supposedly brilliant product designers and marketers can sometimes spend so much time and money coming out with a terrible consumer product. People pointed out the naked girl aspect of it because they were visibly repulsed by the sketches preceding it, but as a standalone short film, this would have gotten above average reviews.Same with the Homeschooled part which was completely disturbing and cringe worthy, but at the same time still relevant as a depraved parody of americanized parenthood.People who are reading this review will raise eyebrows, thinking that I'm trying to dig deep to defend a crap movie by reaching for the meanings of abstract sketches that go out of their way not to have any, but that would be equal to saying Movie 43 is the worst film ever made strictly based on the puerile humour in it and leaving everything else out. They aren't necessarily wrong, but I think the overwhelming majority of scorching reviews on this movie are grossly miss focused.It goes to demonstrate that no matter how people say they have evolved and are ready for anything, they visibly are still not willing to consider things on more than one angle.While this movie is nowhere near as bad as the ratings make it out to be, it's no Godfather.It will still contribute to inspire other movies despite the negativity surrounding it and I wouldn't be surprised to see Movies 43's influence in future films based on abstraction.Movie 43 is the comedic and non-pompous equivalent to Holy Motors. This will floor a lot of people, but it isn't that far from the truth when you clear your mind, take a step back and really think about it for what it is : A collection of abstract shorts, tied together by, and completely outshining a really underdeveloped and crappy main plot.I think that in future years, Movie 43 will probably grow to be some kind of cult classic just for the novelty alone of seeing so many huge stars so far out of their element.",

Why would I do that? Because I like to laugh out loud, and doing it in a white theater is like trying to fart in church. I went to the $3 matin\u00e9e in the slums and watched with glee as major movie stars debased themselves without worrying about why or how. Looking at this movie for higher meaning is stupid, for plot connectedness is even more thick. This was a movie designed to match up to the way we watch most of our video watching anyway. 3 min interludes that we peek at, at our desks or home offices when we should be doing something else. I am completely floored by why SO many people were astounded by the way each segment was more outrageous than the last and how it pulled no punches just went for the throat. What were you expecting, a kind and gentle gross out movie? Come on! All of that aside I love the fact that the actors are what really sell it. The fact that many of them have been nominated for academy awards and international acclaim and were still willing to go and make a movie that was FUN was just really cool to me. So if you're looking to go and see a \"whole\" movie you wont, but if your willing to get up go out and see something that is totally raunchy, as totally raunchy as that youtube video you just finished then go right ahead. But remember, go to the cheap theater, they will laugh with you, and truly that's the point anyway.",

If you ask me what Movie 43 is about, I don't know how to answer. All I can say is that Movie 43 has a bunch of funny (sometimes it isn't even funny) YouTube clips played by stars all combined into a full-length movie. First of all, I would rather watched a bunch of videos on YouTube that I would enjoy rather than watching this. Each clip in Movie 43 has nothing to do with one another, not even a link. All it gives you is a crappy premise that a bunch of ass-kids are finding Movie 43 and that it will end the world. Seriously, nothing makes sense in this movie. It involves time traveling, apocalypse, and explosions that will just leave you thinking WTF. One thing that I hated the most is that how did so many celebrities ended up in this movie? In the first clip, Kate Winslet is having a dinner date with Hugh Jackman who got balls hanging on his chin. C'mon Hollywood, having an Oscar- nominated actor and an Oscar winning actress in this garbage isn't a good idea. All I can say is that Hugh Jackman does have balls taking this role.Basically, each clip after the first one is either the same level with the first or even worse. I might even considering the first one as one of the funnier ones. Later in the movie, you got Naomi Watts and Leiv Schreiber humiliating their homeschooling son, Chris Pratt shitting on Anna Faris, Johnny Knoxville and Seann William Scott kidnapping Leprechauns for gold coins, and Halle Berry making guacamole with her boobs.That's all you got from Movie 43 and now I spoiled it so that you won't have to see this movie.

Though very appropriate, they have slightly mis-spelled his name. And just in case anyone doesn't get it, the correct spelling for his name is Beelzebub.And this is the reason why the Beezel segment is run during the end credits. He IS actually taking full credit for this movie!!And some more on this... Beelzebub or Beel-Zebub ... is another name for the Devil. Wikipedia.BEELZEBUB or BEELZEBUL: (2) The word \"Zebul\" (from \"zebel,\" dung) is a cacophonic corruption of \"Zebub,\" in order to give the name the meaning of \"god of the dung.\" It is more likely that the name \"Beelzebul\" is a dialectic variation of \"Beelzebub,\" as \"Beliar\" is of \"Belial\"; ...From the Jewish Encyclopedia see article 2732-beelzebub.Yeah, he really deserves this appellation too.

Richard Roeper, the esteemed film critic, was well on the money when he described this movie as \"TheCitizen Kane of Awful\" and \"The Worst Movie of All Time.\" If there is any worse movie than \"Movie 43,\" does anyone know what it can be?Take great actors and filmmakers like Richard Gere, Greg Kinnear, Hugh Jackman (you should see what his neck looks like), Kate Winslet (sitting in embarrassment as she stares at his neck), Common, Elizabeth Banks (a sexy intellect who has to reduce herself to acting and directing two different execrable sketches), Josh Duhamel, Halle Berry, Stephen Merchant, Seth MacFarlane (an expert in the cutting edge humor who can burst an envelope), Kate Bosworth, Anna Faris, Kristen Bell, Uma Thurman, Justin Long, and the list goes on and on. Does everyone here really need an extra paycheck with this? Are they just cavorting with friends? Haven't some of these actors already done this brand of humor, only better, in previous projects?There is no meaning or substance to this \"comedy,\" just a series of gross-out, scatological jokes that pile up on top of one another. There are breast jokes, genitalia jokes, blood meant for sick humor, unflattering depictions of people with physical disabilities, cruelty to animals, even of an animated cat in the \"Beezel\" segment, jokes about death, and they just keep repeating themselves that after a while, the viewer loses track of what just happened, as I did. The plot is around failed movie moguls pitching in for a new movie, with the worst ideas surrounding that movie. \"Movie 43\" is supposed to be an homage to the raunchy 1970s anthology comedies of \"The Groove Tube\" and \"Kentucky Fried Movie.\" In 1987, there was \"Amazon Women on the Moon,\" a retread of \"Kentucky Fried Movie\" featuring well-known talented actors of that generation including Steve Guttenberg, Rosanna Arquette, Sybil Danning, and Carrie Fisher, to name a few. All three of these movies were pop-culture satires and worked so well they became cult classics. \"Movie 43\" is in no way becoming a cult classic as the years pass. \"Movie 43\" is not about pop culture. It is just one disgusting joke after another, and that does not make a comedy. And I don't know how on earth any studio could possibly green-light this at all.I'm glad I did not spend $10.00 or more to see this movie at all in the theaters. So I watched this on movies on demand for about $5.00. If you want to know my excuse, Iadore Elizabeth Banks and I like to check her out anywhere because she is pretty, smart, and funny. But like all of us, she is not perfect. For ardent fans of the stars, it's hard to fork over your hard-earned cash for \"Movie 43\" in this recession era. Everyone deserves better, and we hope they get bigger and better projects later on. Best of luck to all.",

It's only because a lot of the humor, sets, contracts and sober-less writing is as incredibly fake as the ideas for Junior Junior High School internet ideas.While most anthologies are of the horror genre, and this does have a minute amount of suspense/sci-fi/stupidity, this one is basically visual slapstick comedy. The weak wraparound story involves two potheads attempting to get back at one of the kid's brothers by making up their need to find \"Movie 43.\"Along the internet search way, many, too many, stories fit in literally an hour and 10 minutes that have zero relevance to the overall plot. Many are pre-preteen sight gags sketches, only one (mentioned above \u2013 \"Super Hero Speed Dating\") is worthy of a viewing. In fact, if that can be found on YouTube, you'll give me a $1,000 for saving you a mere hour and five minutes.Mercifully, there aren't 43 shorts, but it sure felt that way.

This leads them to view several clips which could be the infamous Movie 43, and these characters act as the go between for each of the sketches, which I won't bother describing since there are many other reviews which do. Aside from the overall linking of sketches being a somewhat better idea than the US version, the film as a whole is still awful, and it's claim to be the most outrageous and offensive comedy proves to be very wrong.What Movie 43 really does is imitate 12 year old children laughing at boobs and poop jokes, with the occasional bit of nudity and swearing to ensure that it doesn't raise the bar too high at any point.I went into this film not expecting much, hoping that I would be proved wrong, but unfortunately it seems my expectations were in fact too high, as I was disappointed on all levels. Movie 43 is barely offensive, and is simply a mean spirited, hastily cobbled mess of a film which provides very few laughs.Avoid it.",

But it's one that you just can't help but keep your eyes glued to the entire runtime, like a horrific car crash that's so bad it just demands attention. The laughs don't come organically from the jokes and setups themselves, but from your sheer disbelief and trauma at witnessing this absolute train wreck careen about in your living room, cinema, iPad, or wherever you were fortunate enough to witness this demon. That being said... I ant gonna lie I got a few sick chuckles out of it. Never have I seen such a bedazzled stable of A list talent deliberately demean, degrade and humiliate themselves on camera. It's shocking, gross, nonsensical, and all kinds of stupid. But I can't help recommend it just for shameless shock value, cause admit it, you went to see Jackass and Fubar and every other immature oddity out there. Its made up of a series of short vignettes, pitched by a manic Dennis Quaid sporting skinny jeans and a swooshy Bieber-esque hairdo, to a timid, disbelieving studio head (Greg Kinnear). Quaid's pitches are the most juvenile bunch of bullshit you've ever heard, but he delivers them with sincerity and delusional enthusiasm that makes you want to cry. The first involves a single girl (Kate Winslet) on a date with a handsome, successful socialite playboy (Hugh Jackman, one of the only few who seems to be having actual fun). Only problem... He has an actual scrotum hanging from his neck. I wish I was making this up. It becomes quite the gross out gag at the dinner table, as he is completely oblivious and doesn't even address it. Sean William Scott and Johnny Knoxville show up as buddies dealing with a psychotic leprechaun (a very profane, helium voiced, midget Gerard Butler). Anna Faris plays a sweet fianc\u00e9 who wants her husband to be (Chris Pratt) to poo on her in the bedroom. Hey, a little fecal play must go a long way, considering Faris and Pratt are married for real now ;). Emma Stone and Kieran Culkin star in the weirdest segment, a bizarre nocturnal supermarket dirty talking session. Richard Gere plays an Apple like CEO dealing with a MP3 sex doll that is maiming young men who stick their penises in the area meant for the ventilation fan. Poor Chloe Grace Moretz plays a girl getting her period for the first time, who's ridiculed by her father and classmates in a shocking sequence. Liev Schreiber and Naomi Watts play demented parents who take homeschooling their son to depraved me lows, in one of the few episodes that elicits actual laughs. In the film's funniest bit, Halle Berry and Stephen Merchant are on a blind date, and take a game of truth or dare (well, just dare, really) so far over the top you get to see Merchent get trans ethnicity surgery and Berry get breast enlargements the size of yoga balls. There's also scattershot appearances from Patrick Warburton, Common, JB Smoove, Kate Bosworth, Seth Macfarlane, Uma Thurman, Justin Long, Jason Sudeikis, Bobby Cannavle, Elizabeth Banks, Josh Duhamel, Kristen Bell and too many others to keep track of. This is co,edgy so far in the gutter it's set up camp, beckoning you into an absolutely deplorable realm of disgusting scenarios. Now, there's two different versions of the movie, one which cuts out Quaid's character out and replaces his pitches with a bunch of kids watching YouTube videos. Don't watch that one, as the Quaid version is the lesser of two evils, and flows better. The writing seems to have leapt right of the crude, perverted doodles in the margins of an eighth grader's textbook, and every actor involved looks like they're either being held at gunpoint, blackmailed into doing this, or got really, really drunk, were handed the script and said \"fuck yeah this is awesome\". It's definitely one to check out for pure burnout spectacle though. Just don't say I didn't warn you.",

It is hysterical, but sometimes SO CRAZY and SO PUSHING-ALL-LIMITS, that you're not sure if you are a bad person if you laugh\u0085 but you will.I read SO MANY terrible reviews about this movie, that I contemplated not going\u0085( I didn't want to drag my friends to see something that they would hate\u0085) We all LOVED it!!! (Although, my one friend is still kind-of battling his conscience on whether-or-not that's OK.)In order for me to effectively explain what is necessary for one to fully experience this movie, and get the maximum entertainment value, I will make the following analogy: \"Kool-Aid Fruit Punch\" is advertised as a delicious, fruity and refreshing beverage. To fully experience \"Kool-Aid Fruit Punch\" as it was intended, you will need \"a packet of Kool-Aid powder\" and \"a pitcher of ice-cold water.\" If you had ONLY \"a pitcher of ice-cold water\", you may experience some refreshment, but you are missing out on a whole new level of fruity delicious-ness! However, if you had ONLY \"a packet of Kool-Aid powder\" you would not have a \"refreshing beverage\" at all\u0085. You would have the exact opposite!! You would be quenching your extreme thirst by pouring some dry, fruity powder down your throat.Analogy Key:\"a pitcher of ice-cold water\" = Mary Jane;\"a packet of Kool-Aid powder\"= Movie 43;\"refreshing beverage\" = Funny, Funny Movie;\"Kool-Aid Fruit Punch\" = The Intended 'Movie 43' Experience;The Moral of My Story:To enjoy, \"Kool-Aid Fruit Punch,\" JUST ADD WATER!!!",

I nearly walked out. But prices being what they were, I stayed put until this ordeal was blessedly over. Since that agonizing afternoon, I have tried to be a little bit more selective in which movies I spend my money on. When I saw that Hugh Jackman was in MOVIE 43, I thought it was a safe bet to be entertaining. I mean, how can you go wrong with the Wolverine and Jean Valjean? Boy, was I in for a rude awakening. From the time he appears on screen as the TITANIC lady's blind date, every second until he leaves is excruciating. I don't think I'll ever look at a turkey in the same way again.

Not once did I laugh, except one time, towards the end, in the last skit with Banks, her lover, and her jealous animated cat. The laugh was merely a snicker. Movie 43, is outrageously unfunny, and rightly so, because the stories which are supposed to be pitched ideas, I imagine, are based on gross and offensive gags, if you can call them that, one involving faeces spraying a windshield and street, very much like the one in Dumb and Dumberer, though this is a more graphic sight. From seeing a human pair of balls danging from Jackson's throat, the first star wasted in this (actually, you won't believe how many stars are) to Chloe Moretz, who has a little wet reddy patch on the back of her jeans, surrounded by family and others who overreact, as it's implied she's got her period. There lies the unfunny joke, in the exaggeration, and it's just not funny, for very obvious reasons. It's the unfunniest skit in the movie. I've seen much funnier skits in amateur theatre, that have been frowned upon. But the movie holds a mere fascination is it, in actually how unfunny it is, it acquires a unique style of it's own, but a forgettable one, the movie will linger about, for about couple of days after seeing it. And intervened between the skits, are two teen nerd sorts and a young computer whiz geek, trying to hack into the infamous film, Movie 43, (a compilation of all those funny skits) with some unwelcome hindrances, trying to stop them. My advice to you is, see this film at least once and never again. Erase it from your mind completely. Something the produces should of done before making it, actually thinking this would crack people up.",

            "content": "Complete garbage or a kind of movie that we're not used to?My reviews are usually a long text giving my opinion and what I felt by seeing the movie, but this time I'll try something different because this is no ordinary movie. So I'll start by making some questions:What sort of movie is this? This movie isn't like most, with a story line that we follow while watching. It's a \"series of different (completely different!!)events. But does that mean that has no story? No. It has a story. And is it a good one? Well, no, it's sort of something that we've seen and it's a little stupid, yes, because it's the story of 3 teenage boys throwing pranks at each others, so I guess it has to be stupid. What about the quality of the different stories that we see? I guess it doesn't get better. While watching most of them you will keep asking yourself \"Is this for real?!\" And no. It's not! And this is we're I think the movie has it's biggest problem. It's not believable. Most of the things it shows are 0.0000001% probable to happen. Not impossible, but stil very unlikely. So people watch and think \"What the hell?\" or \"Did I seriously pay for this?\". But let's try to keep a bit non skeptical here. I guess the point of the movie it's not to be real, but funny by showing some insane things that like I said, aren't impossible to happen, so it shows how would people could react in a crazy situation and that is always funny. Another thing it does it to simply make fun of not so real things that were already brought to the big screen and people loved. At end the movie it's just that. And there won't be a huge turn out to set an amazing end. It will be just the follow of different crazy events. It can be a bit disappointing, but it can allow you to have some good laughs and if you just want that and to keep it simple it will be a good movie. For me it would work better as a TV show (sort of like Little Britain) than as a movie, but I guess it gave something different for the big screen and I'm all in favor for that.",

Complete with hazing and a prom date that his mother fills in since he doesn't actually go to school. It was a great satire on the stupidity of people \"home schooling\" their children.

            "content": "Movie 43 got me a little perked up because it seemed to be resurrecting a lost art \u2013 the \"skit movie\". These kinds of films have always been popular in my native Italy, but the US also produced some classic examples, notably \"Kentucky Fried Movie\" and \"Amazon Women on the Moon\", with big name stars making fools of themselves with relish and glee for their friends. I had also read the scathing reviews, production difficulties and the almost non-existent release this film is getting (We were lucky enough to have it showing at our local mega-multiplex) so I suitably lowered my expectations.The films bridging story (kids trying to find the world's most sick and illegal film online) is apparently different to the original version (Hollywood exec pitches lousy ideas at gunpoint) but the change works for the better. The \"skits\" are mostly of the gross-out variety, (as were those in \"KFM\" and \"AWOTM\") trying to push the envelope as far as it can go. Unfortunately by 2013 the envelope has burst long ago, so this kind of thing no longer shocks, leaving it all looking weak, tired and hopelessly lost. There are some sparks of promise in the stories, like the parents (Schreiber and Watts) who try to give their home schooled kid the soul destroying \"High School experience\" indoors, or the \"Motivational Sports Movie\" that cuts through the bull to get to the simple heart of the matter (Blacks will destroy Whites in Basketball anytime!), or the \"I-Babe\" with an I-Pod designed to look like a naked woman by a boardroom or clueless men (featuring Richard Gere as Steve Jobs, which along with the 2005 style advert suggests this was made a long time ago!) who don't get why boys cripple themselves trying to have sex with it, and even the Blind Date where a game of \"Truth or Dare\" predictably descends to absurd levels. However the ideas aren't played to their full strength. It's like a home movie where they said \"OK! Let's try this\", they filmed it, mailed it over and forgot about it. With no central directorial vision, there is no unity of theme or overall guiding hand, no driving energy,something that every other \"Skit\" movie had and works as a result of.I guess with so many different mini-stories, an audience will (hopefully) find some they find personally funnier than the others, so different parts will appeal to different audiences. Personally my favourite parts were the \"Leprechaun Hostage\" mini thriller with Johnny Knoxville, Sean William Scott and Gerard Butler as \"the Leprechaun\", and the bizarre love story featuring Anna Faris (a seasoned veteran of this kind of thing having headlined no less than 4 \"Scary Movies\") as a girl who wants her prospective husband to defecate over her. It actually translates the real fear of losing one's virginity, of making a good impression on a potential love, and the anxiety of sex into a disgusting yet still very human and recognisable story. It would be fantastic if this rare film could actually kick-start a revival of the \"Skit Movie\", but sadly the overall quality (or lack of it) here might kill the genre stone dead for another 30 years! Let's hope not",

            "content": "I've put off watching Movie 43 for a very long time, considering all of the dreadful feedback it received when it was initially released in January of last year. The plot of the film vaguely revolves around three teenagers trying to find the \"most banned film on the internet\", which is appropriately titled Movie 43, although the American version of the film has a completely alternate plot revolving around movie producers pitching this film to a company. Regardless of this, both versions contain this plot solely to string together 12 un-funny, crude, horrific sketch comedies containing an unbelievably star-studded cast of actors. From Hugh Jackman to Stephen Merchant; nobody is left out. I have literally no idea why so many well-known celebrities would agree to be a part of this truly appalling movie. One of the opening sketches features Hugh Jackman and Kate Winslet attending a blind-date, but the 'hilarious' twist is that Hugh Jackman's character has a pair of prosthetic testicles on his neck which only Kate Winslet appears to notice. This successfully sets the tone for the rest of the movie, with scene after scene revolving around a tiresome concept dragged out far beyond being funny. A theory I have heard is that the actors were made to feel guilty after signing their contracts so they became obliged to continue the production, but when you reach a sketch revolving around a woman wanting her fianc\u00e9e to defecate on her, it becomes very hard to believe any such ideas. Speaking of defecation, Movie 43 really leaves no stone unturned when it comes to the juvenile areas of comedy. Incest, periods & blatant racism all make an appearance, and none are handled in a remotely funny manner. In fact, the only slightly entertaining sequences of the movie such as a scene between Stephen Merchant and Halle Berry didn't rely heavily on these kind of topics at all, and were much better for it. The majority of the film seems as if a young, pre-pubescent boy was behind everything, which isn't ideal when there's such critically acclaimed actors present. Although it may seem like I'm being pretentious about Movie 43, that's only because there is genuinely nothing redeemable about this film. I'm all for 'low-brow' comedy when it's done correctly, and I even enjoy the earlier Scary Movie films which feature huge amounts of this, but Movie 43 simply isn't good. I really wish I could say otherwise, because I'm a fan of many actors featured, but it just is downright awful from start to finish. In case it isn't obvious, I'd highly recommend giving Movie 43 a miss. It only runs for around 90 minutes, but felt as if it dragged on for far, far longer. Unless the American version is drastically different, I have no idea why this film was ever made, and feel bad for everybody involved. Do yourself a favour and watch a comedy such as Airplane which shows just how successful a rapid flurry of jokes can be.",

Some segments have missing payoffs like the one where a grocery clerk Neil (Kiernan Culkin) falls in love with Veronica (Emma Stone) or Batman (Jason Sedakis) giving dating advice to Robin (Justin Long). Others, like the one where Beth (Kate Winslet) goes on a date with millionaire Davis (Hugh Jackman), the one where Amanda (Chloe Moretz) experiences her first menstrual cycle, and the one where a man (Chris Pratt) takes laxatives to show his love for his fianc\u00e9e (Anna Faris) are just an excuse to throw out gross-out jokes.

However, other segments are okay, like the game of truth of dare between Stephen Merchant and Halle Berry, the one featuring a gay cartoon cat or a birthday present involving a leprechaun (Gerard Butler). You know your project is in trouble when you title it Movie 43 because these rejected CollegeHumor sketches seem like they were filmed before the producers came up with the title. It especially doesn't work when they bookend these vignettes with a lazy and last minute narrative. I do not object to shock and gross-out comedy, in fact, as a teen, I watched a good chunk of lowbrow shows like \"Robot Chicken\" and \"Family Guy.\" Whereas those were handled with contextual intelligence, Movie 43 is a limp, desperate attempt from over fifteen directors to throw every adult humor on the screen resulting in a giant mess. (1 \u00bd Balls on Chins out of 5)",

A movie has to try harder for it to get such a low rating. Same with the ten out of ten reviews. This movie in no way deserves such extreme responses. The spectrum of love and hate for a straight-forward raunchy compilation film is the same as the spectrum that exists for Funny or Die or Collegehumor. You literally don't get to hate (or love) it that much. I'd say the spectrum exists somewhere between 3 and 7. Anything outside of that, and you're just trying to tip the scales (which is why most reviewers gave a one or a ten).

It got slated by every reviewer that I read or listened to\u0085 but I liked it.It is such a stupid film, but it made me laugh.The movie is about 2 guys who upload a stupid video to You Tube\u0085 when they get a million views in under a minute they think they are web sensations\u0085 until they realize their younger computer whiz brother just hacked into the system and tricked them. So now revenge is on the cards\u0085 they decide to kill his laptop by searching porn sites and giving his laptop viruses. So, to get him away from his laptop they ask him for help finding a banned film called Movie 43. Whilst searching for the film they find a lot of other banned movies\u0085 and we see bits of them all.Yes the movie is completely bizarre, and the stories are completely messed up, but it is still very entertaining. Obviously, when you have a movie full of short stories there are some good ones and some not so good ones. But they are all so weird and not expected that even the not so good ones still keep you glued to the TV because you are trying to understand what the hell just happened. Haha.There are a lot of stars in this film\u0085 all starring in their own little movie. Some of the stars are Dennis Quaid, Greg Kinnear, Seth MacFarlane, Hugh Jackman, Kate Winslet, Live Schreiber, Naomi Watts, Anna Faris, Kieran Culkin, Emma Stone, Richard Gere, Kate Bosworth, Uma Thurman, Kristen Bell, Chloe Grace Moretz, Christopher Mintz Plasse, Gerard Butler, Johnny Knoxville, Seann William Scott, Halle Berry & Stephen Merchant.Wow\u0085 what a line up. But this does prove that no matter how many stars you have in a movie it does not mean it will be an instant success. It is a shame that this was not better received\u0085 it was not as bad as it was made out to be. If you see this, do not expect to see Oscar winning performances and a classic story line\u0085 this is not going to be remembered by the industry in about 10 years time. But if you want a bit of fun with some strange stories\u0085 then this is the film to watch. I suggest getting a group of friends over and just watching it together\u0085 it is good to watch with other people.It is hard to choose a favourite story from them all. There are some that stick in my mind more than others\u0085 I think my favourite was The Catch starring Hugh Jackman and Kate Winslett. It was so sick, but really funny.I will give this film 7 out of 10.\"Remember\u0085 Machines \u2013 They're full of kids\"For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",

This film is practically a showcase of what they find.In between each clip you see the guys reactions from these clips and then eventually they put together that Movie 43 is actually a movie, and what they have come across is going to change the world forever. Some of these sketches are quite amusing I must say but the whole story line just seems pointless.I would say watch this, but would say it's not worth spending much money on.If you do watch this just be sure you are prepared for some dodgy sketches which do literately make you think WTF.The most messed thing in this, is the final sketch which features a cartoon cat called Beezle. He hates his owners partner and literally ends up killing her.

            "content": "What do you think of when someone mentions sketch comedy films? I automatically think of the masterpiece, and one of the greatest comedies ever, MONTY PYTHON'S MEANING OF LIFE. Unfortunately it seems the Pythons were the only ones to ever make a good feature film made-up of sketches.In recent years different writers and directors have tried teaming up to create feature films made up of shorts. The two most recent films that come to mind are THE TEN, the Paul Rudd hosted comedy made up of shorts inspired by the ten commandments, and V/H/S, one of last year's biggest disappointment in the horror genre.Now we have MOVIE 43, which has some of the funniest and embarrassing moments you'll witness in film today. Yes, with each sketch you get a different director and cast members, which makes for a very mixed bag of nuts! So I'll be reviewing each segment separately. Almost all of the segments are written by Rocky Russo & Jeremy Sosenko and those that are not I will credit accordingly.The main story, The Thread, directed by Steven Brill, focuses on two dim-witted teenagers trying to get even with one of their technically savvy younger brothers on an April fools joke. They've asked him to use his computer skills to find a banned film called Movie 43 on their computer to distract him while they load his laptop full of viruses.Hugh Jackman and Kate Winslet star in The Catch, directed by Peter Farrelly of the Farrelly Brothers. This relies heavily on the gross-out factor rather than the shock value of having a man's genitals exposed during a date. What is funny is that Kate Winslet seems to be the only one who notices the problem. It is in her reaction where the genuine laughs lie, yet Farrelly seems more keen on trying to make us disgusted by the presence of the genitals rather than to work a little harder on getting the laughs out of the performance of this talented actress.Liev Schreiber and Naomi Watts star in Homeschooled, directed by Will Graham (The Onion News Network) and written by Will Graham and Jack Kukoda. This is easily one of the funniest bits in the entire film. Two loving parents explain to their new neighbours how they've worked really hard at giving their son the same experiences he'd receive during high school in their personalized home-school program.Anna Faris and Chris Pratt star in The Proposition, directed by Steve Carr (Paul Blart: Mall Cop). This is the lowest point of the film and worthy of walk-outs in theatres. A couple are excited to take their relationship to the next level. To Pratt's character, this means getting engaged. However, before he pops the big question he lets his girlfriend share her idea for what will take their relationship to the next level. The only funny thing about this segment of the film is how excited Anna Faris is about her idea.Kieran Culkin and Emma Stone star in Veronica, directed by Griffen Dunne and written by Matthew Portenoy. This is written, acted and directed perfectly. An awkwardly funny short segment that is dark, twisted and strangely romantic in that psychotic sort of way.In another failed attempt at what could have been a really funny segment, writer Will Carlough and director James Duffy give us Justin Long as Robin trying out some speed dating only for Jason Sudeikis, as Batman, to make the experience even more uncomfortable than it needs to be. Uma Thurman is Louis Lane, Kristen Bell is Supergirl and Leslie Bibb is Wonder Woman in Super Hero Speed Dating.A quick but clever sketch, Machine Kids, written and directed by Jonathan van Tulleken, provides a good and well-deserved laugh.We hit a peak here with the iBabe, directed by Steven Brill and staring Richard Gere and Kate Bosworth. The title already gives too much away.Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz and Christopher Mintz-Plasse star in Middleschool Date, directed by Elizabeth Banks and written by Elizabeth Shapiro. The opening to the segment is the most shocking thing I think I've ever seen done in comedy. It goes from horrific to hilarious very quickly. This short is a major achievement in comedy.Happy Birthday shift us in a new direction with a buddy comedy written by Jacob Fleisher. Johnny Knoxville tries to stop his best friend and roommate, Seann William Scott, from moving out after sleeping with his girlfriend, by getting him the best birthday present ever. I've never liked anything directed by Brett Ratner before this.Halle Berry and Stephen Merchant star in Truth or Dare, where the film looses it's pace with another segment directed by Peter Farrelly, written by Greg Pritikin. You can already guess what happens by the title and Arrested Development used the idea better in a sub-plot that was only ever referred to.At this point The Tread, which should only act as a back-story and a clever way to edit the segments together, takes over and turns into a bad science fiction film. Not funny bad either, just bad. Think Terminator without Terminator.Rusty Cundieff directs Victory's Glory which resurrects Movie 43 just before the credits. Taking us back to 1959, Terrence Howard coaches an all-black basketball team afraid to play the all-white team for the first time.Lastly we have James Gunn's Beezel with Elizabeth Banks and Josh Duhamel. Simply removing this sketch completely would have been a big part of saving this film. This low point is only second to The Proposition segment. We end off on a gross-out joke, leaving a bad taste in your mouth when you finish watching the film.Between some tasteless trash, the gems within the film are lost.",

The rest of the sketches are mostly throw-aways, though most have their moments. The framework device with Greg Kinnear and Dennis Quaid (The Pitch) is also not bad. Superhero Speed-Dating was also pretty funny, though not perfect (especially the ending). If you want something different and don't mind questionable taste/coarse humour, it is definitely worth a look.Possibly even funnier than the movie are all the terrible reviews. Granted, the movie is in poor taste, but it IS funny. These days, if a 90-minute movie has four sketches in it that are side-splittingly funny, another one or two that are quite funny, with the occasional chuckle randomly scattered among the rest of the debris, that's a pretty good deal, in my book.This movie is NOT ANYWHERE near the worst thing that Hollywood has ever turned out. That might seem like a strange endorsement, but it needs to be said. At least it's not another dreaded and dreadful movie remake of some 60s/70s TV show. As if the world needs more of that.",

Even though the trailer shows several different story lines, I'd originally assumed that they would somehow be intertwined into a single story or theme; like you might find in an actual movie. Instead what you get is a collection of lame skits on par with a college film project, using a star-studded cast as bait. I don't know if it was the writing, or the editing, but I found the laziness in the production way more offensive than the content.

First the humor is virtually almost non-existent. Sure there were couple of skits I had few laughs or so. But there were several I watched through with completely straight face. Second I don't mind vulgar things but this movie reached new level of vulgar it was just flat out disgusting. I couldnt believe someone actually thought stuff like this. It was almost like director was enacting weird fetishs and fantasys he had. And lastly I thought the acting even for the material given was piss poor.

It's a sketch-Movie consisting of 12 short skits starring Oscar-Winning actors who you could swear were blackmailed to be in this awful piece of film (and actually somewhat were like Richard Gere!). This movie has no plot. There is somewhat of an overarching storyline but it is as nonsensical and anti-climatic as it can get. A director pitches his crazy ideas to some guy. Aside from that the skits have no connection whatsoever and you just jump from one scene to another making the movie an utterly disjointed mess. But who cares about the plot anyway since the main fun of the movie comes from the skits right? .... right? If only you knew. This movie is unfunny, so incredibly unfunny that it is actually painful to watch at times. It tries to be funny without a doubt but just comes over as extremely awkward. Usually it follows this pattern: Skit makes one joke in the beginning of the scene and from then on repeats and drags on for 5 minutes until you get to the next sketch. The jokes are sometimes funny for a second but the skits culminate in nothing, there is no punchline, nor is it getting any better. I literally sat there at one point giving myself continuous facepalms hoping it would erase the memory of what I just witnessed, not because it was disgusting or anything, but simply because I couldn't believe this thing was made. The skits are so unfunny that the movie desperately tries to bring some shock value into them. It is trying so hard in fact , that it is way to obvious their intention for the public was to go \"ewww\" every now and then, like a studio audience that needs to laugh on demand. But it doesn't shock at all. It just comes off as plain stupid and uncreative. And that is exactly what this movie is. Stupid, uncreative and unfunny. Occasionally there is something funny for just a second but if anything it doesn't result in laughter but in blowing our air out of your nose, and that only because you can't fathom how stupid it is. A lot of people on IMDb give this Movie more than 0-3 stars which in find hard to grasp but many argue that those who dislike the movie possess \"no humour\" or rate it that way because they are offended or take it to seriously. Let me say this: I wasn't offended a single time during this movie because it is as offensive as an 8 year old who thinks he will shock me if he says \"poop\". I don't watch every movie completely seriously. I love comedies, especially dark and offensive humour, so I should be the perfect demographic for this movie. But to me it doesn't deliver on any level of cinema in general. Conclusion: To me, Movie 43 is a terribly disjointed, nonsensical, pseudo-offensive, unfunny, badly-written, mediocrely acted, badly directed, cheaply produced, self-important \"comedy skit movie\" that has no point existing.Feel free to disagree, but don't tell me that that I'm wrong because I \"don't get it\" or something along the lines. If you like the movie, good for you, I don't judge you, even if I think it's terrible, it is just an opinion and you may like something about it I have not thought of yet.",

            "content": "The portmanteau movie was a fad in the 1960s and early 70s. It never worked - as a whole the narrative discontinuities, the shifts in tone and style left no-one satisfied. If a typical narrative movie takes its viewers on a journey, the portmanteau film took them as far as the airport then left them in the departure lounge until further notice. So, knowing that it has been mercilessly pilloried in its home market, I was expecting little from Movie 43. I was pleasantly surprised.If you go to see this film because you're attracted by the names of top shelf actors such as Kate Winslet, Liev Schreiber, Naomi Watts and Richard Gere you'll be sorely disappointed. Movie 43, whose provenance is in the Peter Farelly school of gross-out comedy is about as far away from cinema as a dramatic art as you're ever likely to get. If, on the other hand, you have a taste for humour that contravenes every shibboleth of polite society, then this is the movie for you - it's politically incorrect, flagrantly ridiculous, and persistently crass. It's also cleverly done. I am not familiar with the work of Seth 'Family Guy\" MacFarlane who has a cameo here but from what I've heard of it, this film is in the same spirit.After we get the framing intro with Quaid and Kinnear playing it tongue-in-cheek, the first segment gives us Kate Winslet on a blind date with Hugh Jackman, who is devilishly handsome but has one anomalous feature - a shaven scrotum growing out of his neck like a turkey wattle. This set-up tells you everything you need to know about what awaits you in Movie 43. The scene itself it is funny like Seth's dick-drawing fixation in Superbad but what makes it so much better than just being outlandish is that whilst, of course, the well-bred young woman can't keep her eyes off the misplaced testes, everyone else, including their owner, is oblivious to them. Winslet captures the dilemma of her character perfectly as she grows increasingly desperate for someone to acknowledge her would-beau's neck balls, yet is unable to come straight out and say anything that might be inappropriate.This is followed by a segment in which real-life couple Liev Schreiber and Naomi Watts recount to some new neighbours their regime for home schooling their own teenage son. The loving parents, to make sure that their boy gets a rounded eduction, have carefully reproduced every humiliating, degrading and awkward moment of high school. Comedy is often described as the bringing together of incongruent ideas and this is exactly what makes Movie 43 work. Perhaps the funniest segment, however, is one in which Terrence Howard plays a coach for the first black high school basketball team in US history and tries to explain to his long-segregated players that they are bound to win because they are black.Not all the segments work as well as these and there is a tendency, as is so often for comedies of this frenetic stripe, to run a little ragged at the end. The final segment involving a Garfield-like cartoon cat with sexual designs on its owner was for me the weakest of them and one with a coprophilic fixation I could have done without.If you don't like gross-out comedy definitely give Movie 43 a wide berth but if you do, seeing this sort of thing done by a quality cast is an appealing twist.",

            "content": "Rated R comedies have been making a major surge over the years and really raking it in at the box office. At the same time there have been a lot of films coming out featuring huge A-list casts in every genre, but none more than the latest Movie 43. The trailers were pretty funny, but offered little to what the film was actually about and a bit confusing. Along with the amazing A-list cast it features numerous directors leading the charge including Peter Farrelly, James Gunn, Bob Odenkirk, Brett Ratner, and more. Could this film actually deliver up to the hype or will it be another failed experiment? Movie 43 is an anthology style that follows an overarching segment featuring a crazed screenwriter pitching his insane idea for a movie. Each non-connecting segment delvers a strange array of stories that make little to no sense connected together. Before saying anything about this film you have to understand that this film will only appeal to certain audiences and even then only if they are willing to let it be what it is. The performances aren't always great here, but the overall experiment is really fun. This movie is receiving a lot of negative buzz, but most of that falls more in the fact of too much thought put into it. They step over the line in almost every aspect in this film and it works if you let it. There are tons of uncomfortable laugh out loud moments, but if you try to analyze it or look for smart comedy it just won't work. This is potty humor that will probably only entertain those that look for that sort of thing and enjoy the over the top nature of it all. Most of the moments in this film are unnecessary, but still delivers the raunchy strange comedy that fans of the genre will enjoy.If nothing else all the actors in this film deserve major props as each one put themselves out there. It looked as though they are just having a great time playing in these little worlds and it shows. Seeing some of them step out of their usual types of roles is enough to check this film out and who knows maybe you will enjoy the nasty potty humor that goes along with it along the way. With a cast featuring almost anyone you can think of there has to be someone in there that will appeal to you, so turn off your brain and just have fun.",

Young) and his friend J. J. (Adam Cagley) make a video for YouTube, it instantly gains 1,000,00 views. But this is an April's Fools joke by Calvin's little brother Baxter (Devin Eash) who is a wiz at hacking. So, to get their own back, they claim there is a movie they want him to find. They claim it's the most banned movie in the world that could lead to consequences, perhaps for the world, if watched, it's called Movie 43. As they watch various short films, related to the internet search, they realise it's real, and a terrorist threatens them to get it. \"The Catch\" sees single businesswoman Beth (Kate Winslet) on a blind date with the city's most eligible bachelor Davis (Hugh Jackman), but the meal is overshadowed by her inability to stop staring at his neck, which has a pair of testicles dangling from it, but only she seems to acknowledge it. \"Homeschooled\" sees Anna (Anna Madigan) and Sean (Alex Cranmer) having coffee with neighbours Robert (Liev Schreiber) and Samantha (Razzie nominated Naomi Watts) who home-school their teenage son Kevin (Jeremy Allen White), but the parents have also replicated the school environment, acting out bullying, detentions, throwing high school parties, and Samantha simulates being a girlfriend, but worse is Kevin using a broom with his mother's face on it like a person. \"The Proposition\" sees Vanessa (Anna Faris) and Doug (Chris Pratt) together for a year, he wants to propose marriage, but she interrupts and proposes to let him poop on her, urged by his friend Larry (J. B. Smoove), he agrees to this, so he eats a large meal and drinks laxative, but his impatience to crap gets her angry, chasing her he is hit by a car, causing his bowels to explode, she runs to him, and sitting in his excrement he proposes marriage, she accepts. \"Veronica\" sees Neil (Kieran Culkin) working late in a grocery store, in walks his ex-girlfriend Veronica (Emma Stone), they start arguing and unknowingly it is heard on the intercom by the customers, the discussion turns sexual, and when she walks out the customer urge him to chase after her. \"iBabe\" sees developers of the iBabe life-size nude woman replica MP3 player discussing the problem of male buyers attempting to have sex with it, but a fan is in the genital region, the boss (Richard Gere) listens to opinions from workers Arlene (Kate Bosworth), Robert (Aasif Mandvi) and Brian (Jack McBrayer) to change the advertising. \"Superhero Speed Dating\" sees Robin (Justin Long) and Batman (Jason Sudeikis) at a Gotham City speed dating event, Robin tries to get to know women like Lois Lane (Uma Thurman) and Supergirl (Kristen Bell), but Batman reminds him they are looking for a bomber, they encounter Superman (Bobby Cannavale) and Wonder Woman (Leslie Bibb) before the Penguin (John Hodgman) reveals himself, but the bomber turns out to be the Riddler (Will Carlough) disguised as a girl Robin kissed. \"Machine Kids\" is a short commercial narrated by Phil Crowley showing young men told not to have sex with the iBabe. \"Middleschool Date\" sees middle school students Nathan (Jimmy Bennett) and Amanda (Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz) on their first date, they start kissing and Nathan's older brother Mikey (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) comes in teasing them, then Amanda starts having her period, Nathan panics thinking she is bleeding to death, and Nathan's Dad (Patrick Warburton) and Amanda's Dad (Matt Walsh) get involved too. \"Tampax\" is a short commercial with two women swimming in the ocean, and one of them suddenly gets savagely eaten by a shark with masses of blood, it's an advertisement for tampons. \"Happy Birthday\", directed by Brett Ratner (Rush Hour, Tower Heist), sees Brian (Seann William Scott) giving his roommate Pete (Johnny Knoxville) a captured Leprechaun (Gerard Butler) as a birthday present, it's tied up and they want the obscene creature to tell them where his pot of gold is, the Leprechaun's brother (also Butler) comes to rescue him and shoots the humans, but they kill the leprechauns, find the pot of gold, and Brian reveals to Pete he also caught a Fairy (Esti Ginzburg) who gives blowjobs for gold coins. \"Truth or Dare\" sees Emily (Razzie nominated Halle Berry) and Donald (Stephen Merchant) on a blind date together in a Mexican restaurant, tired with typical dates she suggests a game of Truth or Dare, after some truths he is dared to pinch a man's bottom, and she is dared to blow a blind child's birthday candles, as the game goes on, the dares get crazier, such as dunking breasts in guacamole, tattooing an ejaculating penis to a cheek, getting a face lift, lip surgery and enlarged breasts, and getting surgery to look Asian, until they do go back to an apartment together. \"Victory's Glory\" sees Coach Jackson (Terrence Howard) lecturing his all black basketball team facing an all white team, saying that they will win because they are black, and they do. Finally, \"Beezel\" sees Amy (Elizabeth Banks) worrying that animated cat Beezel is coming between her relationship with boyfriend Anson (Josh Duhamel), the cat is secretly evil to her, she hates him but Anson sees him as sweet and innocent, but with her threatening to leave Anson agrees to find the cat a new home, the next day Amy goes in search for him and Beezel tries to kill her, and vice versa, but she looks like the villain and children at a party beat her up, Anson comforts Beezel, and the cat daydreams of kissing him. This may be the most over-the-top, gross-out movie you'll find, full of highly bizarre and in your face daringly offensive moments, the stars do have a sense of humour, but you question their reasons for allowing themselves to feature in such ludicrous material, I admit I tittered at how ridiculous it was and some amusing bits, but it's not a good ensemble comedy anthology film. It won the Razzies for Worst Picture, Worst Director for Elizabeth Banks (Pitch Perfect 2 - \"Middleschool Date\"), Steven Brill (Little Nicky, Mr. Deeds - \"iBabe\"), Steve Carr (Daddy Day Care, Paul Blart: Mall Cop - \"The Proposition\"), Rusty Cundieff, James Duffy, Griffin Dunne (Practical Magic, The Accidental Husband - \"Veronica\"), Peter Farrelly (Dumb and Dumber, There's Something About Mary - \"The Pitch\", \"The Catch\", \"Truth or Dare\"), Patrik Forsberg, Will Graham, and James Gunn (Slither, Guardians of the Galaxy), and Worst Screenplay, and it was nominated for Worst Screen Combo for the entire cast.

The fact that there are so many Hollywood big-shots in parodies of their typical roles adds a great deal to this little batch of spoofs. There's a lot of gross humor, of course: Scat, mutilation, body parts, etc, but MOVIE 43 doesn't feel the need to just rub its audience's face in these elements, making its point without showing TOO much nauseating stuff. {Fans of nauseating stuff will definitely find some here, but they may be disappointed that it doesn't go farther.} The biggest problem with this film is that it's nowhere near as developed and focused as it could be, and virtually all the scenes, many of which would be worth entire films unto themselves, end just as they start to get interesting. But maybe that's the point because, as the young aspiring filmmakers in the central story attest, the biggest thing this film seems to be parodying is today's lazily produced low budget films(premature credits rolling at 76 minutes, etc).Though it's far from great, there are definitely some things to appreciate here. MOVIE 43 is disorganized and underdone, but even in those respects, it still works (kind of). I think that 25 or so years ago, when I was more into humor for its own sake and less inclined to analyze everything to death, my verdict would have been about the same.",

There were moments in this that were purely horrible like the first kiss, and funny moments like Liev Schreiber describing his actions to horrified neighbours.The Proposition - Essentially about Anna Faris wanting Chris Pratt to defecate on her, this was the second funniest segment to me, watching Chris Pratt stuff himself with Mexican food and laxatives on the advice of his mate before having to attempt to hold it in and then basically exploding was one of the funniest and most childish things I have ever seen.Veronica - I am not even sure as to the plot of this one, although very well and seductively acted by Emma Stone and Kieran Culkin the only moment that even made me smirk was Keiran Culkin fingering Emma Stones mouth in front of a queue of shoppers, this was one of the worst segments and the actors deserve much better, especially Emma Stone.IBabe - This segment featuring Richard Gere, Kate Bosworth and Jack McBrayer was fairly amusing about the naked woman shaped future ipod that teenagers had been having sex with and ending up with mangled penis' due to a badly placed cooling fan, Richard Gere raised enough laughs trying to comprehend why teenagers had been having sex with it and Kate Bosworth was good as the level headed ignored employee.Super Hero Speed Dating - This segment was very weak as well with only Jason Sudeikis as rude, cock-blocking Batman making me laugh. The rest of the actors including Uma Thurman, Justin Long, Kristen Bell and Leslie Bibb barely raising a smile.Machine Kids - Completely unamusing with no famous cast or comedy in sight, basically about kids who inhabit ATM's and photocopiers not getting any love was just depressing and bad.Middleschool Date - This was easily the funniest short with the insanely talented Chloe Grace Moretz as a high schooler getting her first period had me falling out of my chair laughing as Christopher Mintz Plasse and other guys tried to find a cure bringing sponges, mops, frozen peas, even calling 911 to try and cure her. This was just brilliantly acted, written and directed. Just excellently, brilliantly funny.Tampax - A small short about a leaking tampon causing a girl to be eaten by a shark was very funny.Happy Birthday - Seann William Scott and Johnny Knoxville kidnapping a leprechaun Gerard Butler was very stupid and not great, but had a few good laughs in it.Truth Or Dare - This segment starring Halle Berry and Stephen Merchant was very funny and Halle Berry doing unspeakable things with Turkey Blasters, Dips and blind kids was a high point of the movie, Stephen Merchant was solid and quite funny doing ridiculous dares as well.Victory's Glory - Terrence Howard explaining that a team of coloured basketball players could win because of their 'foot and a half dicks' and their race was amusing and stupid.Beezel - For God's sake leave the cinema before this awful, awful post credits sequence, Elizabeth Banks and Josh Duhamel having a cartoon cat disrupt their relationship is so unspeakably bad that it should go down as one of the worst scenes ever.Overall this movie has some extremely funny moments and some awful moments, it is not for the squeamish or easily offended. It is worth watching, purely for Chloe Grace Moretz's brilliant scene. A good attempt at an interesting idea.",

            "content": "I watched this expecting something that is in the category of \"worst movies ever made\" basing from reviews and ratings I have read, and even though it has a current rating of 4% (critics) & 30% (audience) in Rotten Tomatoes, I'm a bit ashamed that I don't think it's that bad. Yes the humor in this film ranges from offensive to downright nasty, but once you let go of your righteous indignation, I think it's quite enjoyable. Now, before you brand me as a mindless dumb ass with no taste in movies for saying I've enjoyed this one, stop right there and let me explain :)I'm not saying this is a masterpiece. It has no plot, only themed skits. The story lines are ludicrous, the jokes are offensive & tasteless, but what made this actually funny is that IT'S MEANT TO BE LUDICROUS AND OFFENSIVE. The big names obviously didn't do this for the money or prestige, so the fact that they're there means they're just having fun (either that or they're really good friends with the producers/directors) & makes me wanna have fun as well. The fact that the people behind this movie included scat/toilet humor, incestuous jokes, nudity/sexual content, graphic violence, racial slurs and other derogatory terms etc. etc. reinforces the idea that this film doesn't take itself seriously and they probably just made that movie to test the limits of the audience's ability to take offense. Like a nuisance candidate in a typical Filipino presidential elections/campaign, you know they're up to no good, but it sure is damn entertaining to watch them on national TV. Stupid and shameless yes, but a big props to them for having balls.The Verdict: Consider yourself warned. Leave your brains in the freezer or under the couch before watching this film because you don't need to do any form of thinking. Seeing Gerald Butler as a foul-mouthed, 2 1/2 feet tall leprechaun, or Hugh Jackman with balls hanging in his neck are signs that this movie doesn't aspire to be anything other than of shock humor value. Obviously it didn't work with most people, but I suggest you try it, who knows, maybe you can enjoy some tasteless comedy once in a while.My Rating: 2.5/5 - I can't guarantee that this movie will make you laugh (i think you have to be in the right mood to be as lenient as I was), if you're easily offended or disgusted, then skip this one.",

It is disgusting in the best ways making you think did they really just get away that! The plot in this movie is not what they advertised it as being a few kids looking for a band video. I wont spoil it but the story around the shorts is ridiculous in it's own way to. Every short has it's moments and it will be fun to talk about who liked which best with your friends after.

Well, yeah it did. And, it should have made it abundantly clear what kind of film you were getting into. A preview which features Anna Farris asking her real-life husband to poop on her, A basketball coach telling his players that they are black and the other team is white, 3 freaked out teenagers at home when one's period starts, and a tied up leprechaun.All of those things were in the preview, and people still say that they were mislead.

            "content": "That last quote is from Movie 43, and as the title implies, this movie is in fact this century's \"Howard The Duck\", so I guess they intentionally made it bad... right?They managed to gather an incredible ensemble cast, but not even the amazing powerhouse of all these actors could make this horrible script any good.Well, I'm gonna briefly go over every sketch in order:1) The Catch: Or as I like to call it \"neckballs\". We start out really bad with a segment in which Kate Winslet has a date with a Hugh Jackman that has testicles in his neck. It's very \"Adam Sandler\" type of comedy. It's as if Sandler wrote this idea for Grown-Ups 2 but was later dropped because it sounded so stupid.2) Homeschooled: Next up, we have Liev Schreiber and Naomi Watts have a teenage son, whom they have home-schooled. It's not hard to imagine they got both these actors in the movie since they are married in real life, so the chemistry is real between them. The awkwardness in this sketch was mildly funny, it would've have been OK in an SNL episode.3) The Proposition: This is where it gets really ugly. Chris Pratt and Anna Faris play a couple, and surprise surprise! They are also married in real life as well. This whole segment is all about poop jokes. Really, this is the epitome of stupid. I'm not even gonna go into detail because it's sick.4) Veronica: Kieran Culkin is working a night shift at a local grocery store and bumps into his ex-girlfriend, Veronica played by Emma Stone. Stone's performance was amazing even for a crappy film like this, but the comedy was just too dull and unoriginal.5) iBabe: This is one of the stupidest segments in the movie, and is what perfectly represents this movie in one scene.6) Superhero Speed Dating: This one stars Jason Sudeikis as Batman and Justin Long as Robin, with Uma Thurmanm as Lois Lane and Kristen Bella as Supergirl. This is my favorite one out of all the crappy skits that are on this movie. The reason? Jason Sudeikis. His comedic chops are great as always. Victory's Glory was pretty funny too but we'll get to that later7) Middleschool Date: Chloe Grace Moretz and Christopher Mintz- Plasse are brothers in this sketch, which is nice because we have half of the Kick-Ass cast reunited. I'm actually impressed Nicholas Cage didn't appear in this, he's in everything! Patrick Warburton is always awesome to have around in minor roles. But this sketch was just too boring and badly-written.8) Tampax: Was this intended to be funny?9) Happy Birthday: Johnny Knoxville captures a leprechaun for Seann William Scott. Pretty sweet to have the cast of The Dukes of Hazzard reunited, by the story so freaking stupid.9) Truth or Dare: This whole segment with Stephen Merchant and Halle Berry was just downward offensive and stupid. Halle Berry hasn't done anything good ever since her Oscar win, its actually pretty sad.10) Victory's Glory: Terrence Howard plays a basketball coach in 1959. They should have ended with this sketch because Howard's performance was just as funny as Jason Sudeikis' in Superhero Speed Dating. It wasn't as funny because the joke wasn't elaborated at all, he just kept repeating the same thing over again.11) Beezel: This is the one that really p*ssed me off. It actually amazed me by how stupid it is. Beezel is an animated cat who is jealous of his owner's new girlfriend, Elizabeth Banks. Every single aspect of this segment is infinitely hate-able, especially that f**king cat. Later out, I find out this was directed by James Gunn, the same director of Guardians of the Galaxy, which made even more p*ssed to know that this incredible director was involved in this piece of crap.12: Find Our Daughter: I later found out that there was a last skit in this movie, but I was so frustrated with that last entry that I had to stop the movie and light a cigarette. Apparently Bob Odenkirk stars and directs this, but I couldn't give a f**k about this anymore.It's pretty amazing that this excuse of a film took more than 4 years to be made. It seems this whole movie was written by 12 year-old kids. I'm so glad I didn't pay money to go watch it... on the other hand, I just wasted 90 minutes of my life that I will never get back. There is only one question to this whole movie: WHY?",

            "content": "I don't really know how best to illustrate my thoughts on this film. I never found myself really laughing along with any of the jokes in Movie 43. The two times I did laugh was not because I actually thought the film was funny but because of how ridiculous it was that someone thought it was a good idea to include the things they did.The main issue I had with the film is that everything is overplayed. None of the jokes have the kind of staying power that this film seems to think they have and as a result, every joke is dragged out for way too long. Almost the entirety of the film seems to feature the kind of humor that your stereotypical dude-bro frat boy might find funny. Almost every short sketch in this film contains one singular joke and for nearly every one of these jokes they are almost exclusively toilet humor or are of an explicit sexual nature. Every joke is spelled out as if the audience didn't catch the poop joke the last 5 times it was made. At some point any chance every sketch has of being funny becomes drawn out and annoying as a result.Going into this film I thought that it couldn't be so bad considering the relatively short run time, but while watching it, I found myself constantly wondering where the end was, only to find out that I was a quarter of the way through, half way through etc. This film, like its sketches, overstay their welcome by a lot and I can't say that I can recommend this to anyone unless you like to watch bad movies or, if for some reason, your sense of humor hasn't left high school.",

Easily the worst movie in Jackman's filmography!! It is an embarrassment to all concerned. Jackman has once scene (as do all the celebs in the cast) and it's cringeworthy,How this attracted the cast it did, is beyond me!!

            "content": "Low level movie executive Griffin Schraeder (Greg Kinner) listens to a pitch by unhinged screenwriter Charlie Wessler (Dennis Quaid) containing a series of vulgar, tasteless outrageous vignettes featuring an assortment A-List actors.A longtime passion project for Farrelly Brothers frequent producing partner Charles B. Wessler, who desired to make a modern day version of Funny or Die \"except you can go crazy\". The film had trouble getting financial backing due to studios disliking the scripts. Eventually Wessler managed to secure both Hugh Jackman and Kate Winslet for one short and used their presence in the film as a way to sell other A-list actors on the viability of the project in a way not too dissimilar from how international co-productions do presales based on the presence of big name stars. When the film was released it was savaged by critics, many of whom gave hyperbolic statements calling the film one of the worst ever made and in Richard Roeper's case \"The Citizen Kane of awful\". The movie isn't one of the worst ever made, but it's not all that good either.The central linking plot thread (in the version I saw, there is an alternate version I haven't seen) is basically a Swimming with Sharks type scenario by way of The Player where a fictionalized version of Charles B. Wessler played by Dennis Quaid is an insane homeless man who snuck into the production office by way of sexual favors and out of desperation holds Greg Kinnear's studio executive character Griffin hostage while reading his outlines. It's a reasonably amusing bit as we see the scenario get more deranged, but it's ultimate payoff is a rather lame 4th wall break that sacrifices much of the build up that promised an explosion and ended with a mild balloon pop.The vignettes the movie builds itself upon are mainly one joke affairs that such as Hugh Jackman playing a character with testicles on his chin and no one notices (except his blind date played by Kate Winslet) and a homeschooling situation that works a little \"too hard\" at the authentic high school experience, while others go for more bizarre gags involving leprechauns, superheroes, or strange animated pet cats. Many of these shorts maybe got on average .75 laughs, and given the average length of these shorts was around 4-6 minutes (rough estimate) it's not the best return but it's not the worst either.Movie 43 is kind of reminiscent of not so much the movie's producer Wessler was striving for like Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Sex (But Were Afraid to Ask) or Kentucky Fried Movie, but more in line with stuff like Loose Shoes or If You Don't Stop You'll Go Blind. The only difference between those movies and this one is Loose Shoes or If You Don't Stop You'll Go Blind were made before Bill Murray and Robin Williams got famous and Movie 43 was made because these people were famous. While it certainly is a disappointing output from proven comic actors and directors, it's hardly the worst comedy film or \"The Citizen Kane of Awful\" especially when we consider the fact that Craig Moss and Seltzerberg exist.",

They should have stopped every scene one minute earlier that would have saved some comic aspects. If you still want to watch the movie, I recommend watching only some of the scenes. Christopher Mintz-Plasse getting crazy about a girl having her period for the first time really is entertaining as well as Gerard Butler as Leprachaun. Still - I don't get why all of these actors were willing to participate in that movie. To them - this might have been fun. For the audience it's flat, disgusting and it really makes no sense.

Sometimes ya just want to have fun and enjoy laughing at inappropriate jokes.It's obvious that all the actors really liked letting loose and having some fun. I really hope we see similar projects from these actors where they can just let loose and have fun with their celebrity. Samuel Jackson is a great example (though no in this title) of a guy that acts just to act... for no other reason than to work and have fun. I'm pretty sure no one would think some of his lessor works were taken because he thought he'd get an award for it. Some times it's just for the fun of it... so ease up and relax.

            "content": "I know I am in the minority with this belief but: MOVIE 43 is not the worst movie of 2013. It's not even the worst movie I've ever seen. Honestly, it's not that bad. It's obscene and it's stupid, and it's definitely going to send a lot of people running in the opposite direction. But, and this might just be an indication that something is wrong with me, I actually found it amusing. It's not laugh-out-loud funny. I don't think I actually laughed once throughout the entire movie. Normally, for a comedy, this should be an official sign that it's an absolute failure. MOVIE 43 is different. Part of me wants to believe there's something more behind this anthology of some the most tasteless sketches you'll ever see. The easily explanation is that all twelve directors (not including Bob Odenkick because his segment was cut) suffered some immense form of communal brain damage and kidnapped some of modern film's most popular stars, forcing them to do this movie in exchange for their freedom. How else could you explain people such as Kate Winslet, Naomi Watts, or Richard Gere starring in a collection of absurd stories including: a blind date with a man featuring an unfortunate scrotal deformity, a romantic evening in which a woman wants her man engage in her\u0085um\u0085fecal fetish, Robin (as in the Boy Wonder) tries his hand at speed-dating when Batman stops in to ruin it with his raunchy behavior, a game of Truth or Dare getting progressively more offensive on a dinner date, and more.Part of me wants to believe that MOVIE 43 is someone's weird idea of a social experiment. The movie is populated with an impressive list of actors and actresses that, under normal circumstances, would never consider coming anywhere near a movie of this nature. Halle Berry, Greg Kinnear, Hugh Jackman, Liev Schreiber, Anna Faris\u0085well, all right, this is par for the course with Faris. Maybe not this extreme though. I believe the goal of the filmmakers was to see just how disgusting or disturbing a movie they could create and release nationwide with a cast of all-stars to see just how many people would pay to watch it. They had to know how this movie would be received by critics and audiences, and they did it anyway. How did they convince all of these actors that it wouldn't ruin their careers? I think the only reason it didn't was because no one really saw this during its short run in theaters. Or maybe they knew the movie's nature would be the exact reason it would succeed? It's advertised as the raunchiest movie ever and critics are universally panning it with an epic score on Rotten Tomatoes of 4%. I'll be honest: that alone was enough to get me to watch it. I couldn't resist finding out what the directors put these actors through and how bad it could possibly be and, the odd part is that I didn't think it was all that bad. A lot of this movie falls flat. You expect it to. In that sense, it does not disappoint. But there were a few laughs to be found mixed in with all the insanity. You have to be willing to except the lowest of low-brow humor for it, but it's there. There were a couple of segments I actually enjoyed. Yes, I laughed at the \"Superhero Speed Dating\" with Jason Sudeikis and Justin Long as a warped version of Batman and Robin at a speed dating service. The \"Truth or Dare\" segment with Halle Berry and Stephen Merchant was pretty funny, and I actually loved James Gunn's \"Beezel\". There was so much wrong in \"Beezel\" and I couldn't believe what I was seeing at times. All I'm going to say is: Josh Duhamel (of the TRANSFORMERS movies) and Elizabeth Banks are real troopers to put up with everything they're put through. And then there's the best segment of the bunch from, and this is one of the few times you'll hear me praise his work, Brett Ratner. The bit with Johnny Knoxville and Sean William Scott as a couple of buddies battling a couple of leprechauns was awesome. Pure awesome.On the opposite end of the spectrum, \"The Proposition\" was a waste of time. Its jokes are telegraphed and you can see where the jokes are coming from a mile away, and \"Victory's Glory\" is a one-note joke stretched to its breaking point. The rest of the segments run the gamut from lame to mediocre. There's plenty of what you'd expect from a movie like MOVIE 43\u0085nudity, obscene language, loads of bodily functions, and slapstick. MOVIE 43 is no masterpiece, but I don't think it's anywhere near as bad as 99% of critics and viewers appear to believe. And to anyone declaring it the worst movie of 2013: go watch A GOOD DAY TO DIE HARD and see if you still feel that way afterwards.",

And I really want a movie like this to succeed, so it's unfortunate. It's definitely not the worst movie ever made, which is what attracted me to this movie. It's one of the worst when you take into account the dozens of A list actors in this film. Since this movie probably has the most A list actors out of any movie ever, one wonders if perhaps the jokes were funny on paper, yet failed in execution? The answer is simply no. The jokes seem like they were written by people who aren't/or have never been involved with comedy in their life. Some of the segments play out like they're bits from a stand up comedy routine transitioned into film, although the material seems like something someone would have written for their first ever stand up act at an open mic. Most of the bits play out like they were taken from a 3 men go into a bar style joke, which I'm pretty sure they were. Most of the material is very unoriginal, but worst of all, originally they weren't even funny jokes. One of many unoriginal/unfunny examples; the segment which they (the writers/directors, who knows?) must of thought was absolutely hilarious, since it was the segway in the movie trailer 1 version (although it's not like they had much funny material to choose from). An all black basketball team is getting ready to play an all white team and the coaches game plan is you're black, they're white, it's that simple. Seriously? Who the hell thought revamping that joke for the umpteenth time would be funny? Why would you tell a 5 second slapstick joke for a 5-10 minute segment? Why would that be the bait to get everyone to go see this movie? The answer again is simple, this movie must have been put together or organized by people who are not known for their comedic sense. One bit that probably played out well (especially in first person) in a stand up act was the home school kid being taught by his parents about the social dynamics of a public school. This doesn't work on film, but is a great stand up bit if delivered well. The Leprechaun segment is a total fail and plays out like one of those painful long 3 guys go into a bar type of joke that unfunny people tell, which takes several minutes and you wait for the punchline so you can laugh to humor them, but at a couple moments throughout the joke something silly is said which you mistake for the punchline and the pain continues. Anyways, you catch a Leprechaun to get it's gold, then you catch a fairy. Well, whats the fairy for you ask? The fairy gives blow jobs for gold coins. Really, really stupid!Pooping on girlfriend segment = really lame, plays out like a 1 dimensional joke (will you poop on me, errr), but in hindsight it's about the build up at which point the dude gets hit by a car and essentially becomes a crap pi\u00f1ata (that one part made me chuckle but lame segment). Period segment - so painfully lame. This is the dumbest as in worst segment among the many.Supermarket segment - this has been done soooo many times. In fact, the whole, you go after and get that girl, while a crowd of people applause has now been performed more in spoof fashion then it ever had in the dramatic corny sense. The ibabe segment didn't entirely fail on video, but another stand-up bit. I did like a couple of the commercials in between segments. The tampon commercial with the shark and the kids in the machines made me chuckle. From what I read apparently the segment where Hugh Jackman is on a blind date with Kate Winslet and what appears to be the perfect date until Jackman takes of his scarf and has a pair of balls hanging from his chin and no one seems to notice but Winslet, was the first segment shot in the movie (it's the best segment), which loured other big name actors. Also this movie probably became attractive because it took almost a decade to get a studio to back it and it was probably seen as too offensive to be approved type of thing. I theorize that actors get really tired of these studios dictating these clich\u00e9' unoriginal, cookie cutter style films and thought that a movie like this challenged those perimeters. That's why it's extremely unfortunate when a movie like this fails because it's a further detractor for studio's to pick up any movie that steps out of the tight Hollywood box, while encouraging the same lame/unoriginal crap.",

I was too busy laughing because this is great. There were so many great skits. You could get a laugh from all of them, even if they weren't that funny. The only downside to this movie is the story that revolves around each of the skits: Two boys searching for Movie 43 while another one is putting viruses on the younger boy's computer. Maybe if the boys had had more experience in movies I would've found it more entertaining. I found it hard to find this as funny as the skits. Luckily it was not in there too much. The other downside for me was the ending with the three boys. I don't want to spoil it for anybody but it was very unrealistic, even for a comedy.",

I think everyone was wanting it to amount to what is deemed comedy on a broader overall social standard and what films conform to of the same genre. I was laughing at each mini clip with all the different scenarios, You need to find the fun and lightness in it, not think about it to much, and just laugh. There is no need for this to be so serious, there are many others films that can do that. I can almost bet at least everyone that had watched this laughed at one of the mini clips at some time or another.

The the third guy at the barbecue is similarly funny in his sardonic reaction to hearing the enthusiastic defense of the girlfriend's request.In the sketch \"Middleschool Date\" the panic and naivete of the boy at his girlfriend's predicament are poignantly funny, while his brother's attempts to find solutions to her predicament are just absurdly funny.If you are are a 15 year old boy then you will appreciate the raunchiness.

This format gave freedom to the script writers and made the humour flow freely (like the Family Guy) without the obligation of having-to-stick-to-the-story (like the South Park). Both of the shows I compared to are by all means great, and so is the Movie 43. Racism, sexism, course language, all kinds of humour (they even made fun of the coprofiles) - all of that and much more in here. My favourite part was the one with the domestic education (mostly because of Naomi Watts <3), but they are all great. Great script, great play, an hour and a half of pure laughter. I personally don't like comedies much, because they mostly tend to exploit one character in a strange situation (like the ones with rob Schneider, pardon my language) or just repeat some fart jokes, or be made for black audiences mostly, but this one is very different.

It was obviously made intentionally to cross the line of decency and good taste, so I understand all the 1/10 of all those people who do not tolerate sick humor, obscenities, nudity, racist jokes and much more than this.

            "content": "(**) out of (****)- ROTTEN\"It's the Citizen Kane of awful!\" \"It's been shelved for over three years!\" \"No actors are promoting it\" \"It has a zero on Rotten Tomatoes!\" Who on EARTH would pay to see such a thing? Me of course! Call me sophomoric, but whenever I want to see a film, whether good/bad consensus, I see it anyway out of my own curiosity. To my surprise, maybe I just had too much of an open mind or I had some LSD, but this movie is not the earth-shatteringly, god-awful atrocity probably 95% of the Internet is leading you to believe.What they're not telling you is how entertainingly awful these skits are, but the sour feeling you get after you watch it does not leave you. See with Movie 43: It's pretty damn amusing to see actors such as Naomi Watts and Kate Winslet to be engaged in some pretty degrading roles, and see them just take a big sh-t on their career. The problem? This is where the fun ends.For one, I hate the rating of this film. It's a solid R (tons of breasts, vaginas, etc.), lots of foul language, and I wouldn't even feel comfortable having my 15 year old cousin watching this, but the humor is so childish, without all its adulterated gigs, it would be a G rating. It's almost like the directors are left with this weird, unclear demographic. What's also pretty lazy about this film is how cheap the entire thing looks. You can definitely see all the money went to these actors and not much else. There's not much to be said about Movie 43, than what I already have said. The skits, while entertaining to see your favorite stars engage in some whimsical gags, just leave you with a bitter feeling afterwards, like you just gave a homeless guy on the street money for crack. And the entire thing feels cheap and nothing more than a cash grab. Nonetheless, it induced a few laughs out of me here and there and while it's a train wreck, it's one I couldn't stop looking at. So Movie 43 is tolerable, however, there's no way in hell I'd see it again.",

Of course, many people might not tolerate this type of humor, but I don't consider it dumb(not that I'd mind laughing at dumb jokes). I liked the screenplay. I least liked the leading characters. Their purpose, I think was to play the actually funny things. These kinds of films's purpose is certainly not to win an Oscar, but I like the daringness when making movies.

For me is an icon in its gender, it has everything: hilarious humor, great actors and amazing performances.

Generally involving sex, pee or poo... usually, all of the above.It's not going to win any awards for comedy (aside from a Razzie for 'Worst Picture') but I can say it got a few chuckles out of me... which is more than plenty of other bad comedies have managed......Although this is not Movie 43 is worth watching, far from it. If you find yourself cringing a lot more in a comedy instead of laughing, it's never a good sign.I'm just of the opinion that this is nowhere near 'The Worst Of The Worst'.

However, I saw it on Netflix today and decided to actually watch it for myself and see if it really was that bad.IT ISN'T!Of course it isn't a cinematic masterpiece, but if you don't go into it expecting the greatest comedy on Earth, then you won't be disappointed. But if you have an open mind, you should enjoy yourself, as I did.In fact, when you take the film in context (which I won't give away), it actually makes sense, and is funnier for it. Especially when you consider that you have 'Boomer' actors mixing it with modern issues, concepts and ideas.Most of the actors in this film have kids, and it shows. In fact, I imagine they were all thinking of their kids when they were acting our their scenes. And it makes for a very entertaining film.This film is solid, but it won't appeal to some people because it IS 'gutter humour', but delivered in a different way; and dare I say, in a more 21st century way, and dealing with 21st century issues and ideas that younger people can relate to. And when I say \"younger\", I mean anyone who isn't a 'Boomer'.This is also an incredibly socially conscious film when you consider the material it deals with, and how it is dealt with.It's a controversial film, for good reason, but it has also definitely opened the doors to usher in a new generation of socio-political humour for the younger generations....and like I said, when I say \"younger\", I mean anyone who isn't' a Boomer.",

I knew that here on IMDb it was panned. Critically it was panned. Everywhere it was panned. I wanted to like it anyway. I like liking things. People complained that the film was disjointed. I thought there was a large-scale cohesiveness to it - every different short film was a parody, for one, it took something simple and made it outrageous. Of course, that's the nature of jokes and it's hardly groundbreaking to say that this comedy film was brought together by the fact that all of it had jokes.But the thing that brought this film together was the satirical element. It wasn't on the surface. If you watched this movie expecting a nice story you were always going to be disappointed. But the satire is heart-wrenchingly funny. The scene where Kieran Culkin compares Emma Stone to the \"slutty one from the Golden Girls\" was beautiful. I had to pause the film to laugh.I feel like if you read into this film you'll enjoy it on all levels. If you see it as an interplay of themes and ideas and concepts, you'll really like it. Conversely, if you have the sense of humour of an eighth grader, you'll also enjoy it. However, if you're just the average movie go-er, and you don't watch movies to be critiqued but rather as a form of casual entertainment, this movie probably isn't for you.Above all though, this movie was funny because I wanted it to be funny. I went into it with the mindset \"people say this movie is bad, it will probably be bad in terms of story and character development and all the traditional things that movies are judged by, but I'm willing to be impressed\" and on that front, movie 43 did not fail.",

I can understand people getting offended by some of the humour - lots of taboos breached, bad language, gratuitous violence, crudity. But that alone a bad movie does not make and could be equally applied to lots of other highly rated movies. These are not public service announcements - do your homework before you watch and try and remember to SWITCH OFF if you find yourself being offended! The whole thing was pretty nicely polished *except* the premise tying the sketches together. They would seriously have been better off just making a film of back-to-back sketches without that nonsense. Oh and by the way - the description in IMDb is way off - there's nothing at all about a producer pitching stories. Instead we have a couple of teenagers trying to make a wacky video and get loads of hits on the internet. A younger brother tricks them into thinking they have a hit. As revenge, they convince him there is this awesome Movie 43 they need his help locating, and in the meantime one of them gets busy filling his laptop with porn/viruses. The sketches appear to be what they stumble across while surfing the web trying to locate the fabled movie 43. A more terrible set up for a collection of comedy sketches I cannot imagine, and this really let the movie down more than anything else. Some of the sketches are pretty decent/funny and certainly worthy of more than 5 stars, let alone 1. Alas, some were a little off and unwitty. But like I say it's all really well polished and you'll be amazed by some of the cameos here - check the credits after you watch it. You'll laugh when you work out who Gerard Butler played. I suspect the makers of this film were gunning for \"Amazon Women on the Moon\" or \"The Onion Movie\" but I'm afraid this falls short because of the godawful premise, and the low quality of a couple of the sketches. The array of stars they assembled deserved better writing than this. Also, IMDb - thanks for misleading me with your bizarrely erroneous description - sort it out please!Update: after a bit of googling, I *think* the US version may match the description on IMDb. For some reason the version I saw has the thread running through it I desecribed above instead. That's a guess though - it wasn't 100% clear.",

Kate Winslet's reaction was priceless.It's funny if you are OK with this type of humor. If not, yeah stay away. It's 90 minutes of this type of humor.",

Yes, I agree that it is partly just ridiculous and you are sitting there wondering and trying to grasp the stupidity of it all. But you do this with a laugh and that's the point! The acting of all of the \"stars\" is very good (like you would expect them to be) and they carry the movie along and it definitely does not get boring. You constantly wonder what might come next.Tastes differ, and so does humor. This is certainly a humor more of the black kind. It is very over the top (or under the belt) and reminded me partly of Monty Python or The Naked Gun. Its raw and sometimes shocking jokes are provocative and original at the same time. I watched this movie together with my girlfriend, and her review of this would be: \"This is so stupid!\" She did not laugh as much as I did. Again, tastes differ! If you can't laugh about farts, poop or chin-balls...don't watch it. Otherwise, take a look and don't take it serious. Just watch and laugh!",

A freewheeling satire of Internet porn sites, it's a series of unrelated short clips covering everything from testicular displacement, vivid child abuse, incest, defecation fetish, dirty talk fetish, sex dolls, cosplay, child labor, genital mutilation, torture, menstruation, blood, leprechauns, sex fairy, truth or desire, bbc, cartoonish bestiality, to Internet porn. I've never had a headache or felt as physically ill when watching a movie as I did while watching this one.

I imagine Kentucky Fried Movie irritated and \"offended\" about as many people when it came out, seeing as how human nature doesn't change much in 35 years. There will always be a majority of people who get their undies in a bundle over bodily secretions, sex and silly taboo parodies. If there is any valid criticism of this film as a raunch-fest, it's that it's a little predicable in the bodily fluid department.

The sketches were not movie, and worst of all, half of them were not nearly as offensive as the trailer said they'd be! The first sketch started out fairly promising and lived up to it's potential of offensiveness. But from then on, it was just bad. The only other sketches I could get into was the one with Noami Watts and the one with Christopher Mintz-Plasse.

Its creative, fresh and fast. Finally, if you need a great flick for hanging out with friends, this one doesn't let you down. there is just enough time to re-fill the drinks!For all the haters here : if you're in a bad mood, or you're lacking sense of humor, please watch something else and not to mention: to write reviews on IMDb.written by an enjoying person",

It is an unfunny \"comedy\" that only uses poorly done shock value humor in order to attempt to get the viewer to laugh. This is the biggest viewing regret of my entire life and I have watched a lot of movies that I have not liked. I was willing to give this movie a chance. I sat down to watch it and thought to myself, this can't be as bad as everyone says it is. IT WAS SO SO SO much worse. I never felt even the slightest bit amused by this monstrosity. It spits in the face of young filmmakers that are struggling to try to break into the film industry with its \"story.\" This movie should have never been made and the actors should be ashamed to have been apart of something so greedy and repulsive. I am not someone who is easily offended, but this movie offended me with how how absolutely horrendous it is. You could not pay me to watch this movie again. I find this movie disgusting. Watch anything else instead of this. This movie represents everything bad about Hollywood like greed and elitism. Please please seek out a small indie film instead of this and support a smaller filmmaker who is making movies because they love film not because of a greedy studio contractually forcing them to make a project!",

I have given it 8/10 as maybe 2 of the shorts were not as funny as the others but even so seeing the cameos made it special. Please do not listen to the other reviews and give it a try. Also watch beyond the first bit of credits as there is an extra small hidden. A gem of a movie and will watch again. Well worth a watch.",

And I especially appreciate Dennis Quaid for being willing to poke fun at himself. My recommendation is to watch this with a few other people in the room. It gets funnier the more people you have laughing with you. So if you like the Zucker and Farrely Bros films, you will enjoy this Big stupid, offensive, non-PC comedy. A breath of fresh air.",

For instance, in some of these parts of the funny stories I was forced to pause the movie because I was laughing so hard that I had to gasp for air. My favorite story was the story with wolverine's brother. My second favorite scene was with Wolverine when he had balls on his chin. They also got a bunch of super funny actors/ actresses that I recognized from other movies. So all in all I would highly recommend the watching of this intense movie. Some other reviews said that this movie sucked but do not read those because those people probably liked inception a lot, but if you read my other review on inception, you find out that inception is not good and overrated and it is super boring.",

The point of this movie was to be pointless and to push the envelope. This movie was an escape from reality, it wasn't meant to be Gone with the Wind; it was meant to create laughter.The movie broke a lot of taboos which I think was the point. It wasn't going to rant and point down on you, it's going to submit to one's guilty pleasure. This movie tried to offend everyone and it did, so criticism of what it was meant to do?Look at what 2013 offered....Hangover 3, which rehashed everything from the previous two. So it didn't add anything.Internship, which wasn't funny and couldn't rekindle the magic of Vaughn and Wilson.Scary Movie 5, which wasn't funny and why was it made?This is the End, which was just as offensive but without the humor? Why is the devil raping a guy funny again?The Heat, which pushed Melissa McCarthy down our throats and didn't offer a comic release?We are the Millers, which tried to be a movie with morals but didn't offer any growth in character or story.So why is Movie 43 so despised? It was raunchy? So were the previous mentioned movies. It was political incorrect, that was part of the appeal to push the envelope.Maybe that is what's wrong with Hollywood. When creativity comes around, the public hates the unknown. Again, this movie wasn't going to get an Oscar but it did entertain. Wasn't that the purpose?I think it needs another watch. The movie gets attacked by everyone but I don't see why? This movie will never be confused for comedies like Animal House or Caddy shack, but it did provide the audience an escape.So everyone hates this movie, everyone is entitled to their opinions; I just don't see why the mass hate. It was offensive but that was the point. It was an equal opportunity insult to the senses. Has everyone become so prudish that once offended, they neglect the humor aspects?Movie 43 wasn't as bad as the critics propose it to be. The movie does it's job by giving an abstract view of different areas of comedy. If you are easily offended, then movies like Girl's Trip, Sausage Party and Sex and the City would get the same criticism.So give it another watch, it's not as bad as everyone wants you to believe it is. It has the direction of James Gunn, it has the talent of Richard Gere, Elizabeth Banks, Halley Berry, and Hugh Jackman; so that should peak the interest. Again, this isn't an Oscar movie and it wasn't presented as one. It's a comedy that went 'there' and it got chastitized doing so.",

Since I do not want to put in a spoiler it is best to describe it as humor in The family Guy category. It is really out there with an impressive cast of famous and wonderful actors. Humor is funny when it scratches the taboos in a society and this one hits a nerve when it comes to sex, parenting, social customs, jealousy, relations, racism and more. The only thing I missed was a full blown crack at religion. Maybe movie 44 can fill that gap. Finally I think this is a must-see movie for any movie lover. That does mean you have to like it, but from a pure cinematographic point of view this icon of a film is worth your while. I mentioned family Guy before, but I salute The filmmakers in The USA who had The courage to make movie like this with real actors and managed to give me movie that scratches The edges of society in a manor that deserves a sequel.",

You do HAVE to be a fan of sketch comedy to appreciate the episodic nature of this movie. It barely holds together a frame of a movie, which is a something like a found footage type of spoof. There was another movie that I watched that was not as funny as this, but similar, called InAPPropriate Comedy, and that is much more deserving of the hate it receives than this. That movie, while somewhat funny, falls flat FAR more frequently than Movie 43. This is a star packed sketch comedy that employs toilet humor galore, and enough variety to keep you interested. If it doesn't grab your attention from the first sketch with Hugh Jackman, then this movie will NOT be for you I think. This movie is very divisive among it's crowd, and I think that many people who voted this 1 star didn't actually watch the whole thing. Like many positive reviewers of this Hollywood fun project, I am a fan of a huge amount of other movies, reaching from pretty much every genre. I watched this movie like other reviewers and laughed the whole way through... Does this make me a moron another reviewer asked? No, it's just we felt in the mood for a good dumb laugh at that time. I have seen this movie three times since it came out and I do not regret it, because I laughed every time. It is funny each time, and though the segments with the teens (the frame of the movie) occasionally fall flat, even they provided a good laugh at the end too. I rate movies based on what it was trying to accomplish it it's genre, and for this one, it did lewd and crude very well. I will say it's not for everyone though, it is quite in your face with the vulgarity of its humor, but if you can stand it, it's hilarious! 8/10",

The film is shown in the form of a number of short films, all focusing on awful protagonists and scenarios that will make your toes curl.

A lot of the humour is just distasteful and cheap, the 'story' lacks anything that resembles a real film.If you pay to watch this film, you're in for a huge waste of money. Luckily this film doesn't even attempt to aim for anything realistic or serious which makes it a fun watch as you're waiting to see what the insane directors can conjure up next.

This is certainly not a comedy for the whole family, nor is it one for a husband and wife. Which means this is generally geared towards goofy teenagers looking for nudity, trashy language, and the wolverine with balls on his chin. For that, I identify this film as a masterpiece.Most of the critics have said this is without a doubt the worst film ever made, but I will not say that, because that is undoubtedly what this film wants. It is a simple f**ck you to the mainstream, because, well they have the mainstream. They have accomplished finding some of the most critically acclaimed actors in today's pulp culture and put them into an overwhelmingly filthy movie. I applaud them.So threw all the scenes in the film, it wasn't so much the jokes that made me laugh, it was more so the people playing them. Where else will you find Hugh Jackman with balls on his chin, or Chloe Grace Moretz on her period. You will see Jason Sudeikis in a Batman costume, Halle Berry in crazy truth or dare contest, and watch as Dennis Quaid turns to violence after being driven insane from being shunned out of Hollywood. Yes this film is pointless, yes its stupid and dirty, but this is Movie 43, and it is truly, one of a kind.",

This movie was just fun all the way through, especially because of the huge stars in it who were happy to send themselves up and show that not every actor is honing his 'craft' and that some are able to make fun of themselves at their own expense. Thats a pretty special and admirable display of character to me.I absolutely loved the spoof adverts such as i Babe, Tampax etc. These prove so popular on face book and you tube, so why not in a Hollywood movie too? Tarantino showed that it worked well in his grind house flicks, so I think its just as good here as it is there.The humour throughout this was just bizarre, surreal and absolutely fantastic. Loved it loved it loved it.The pace is fast, the energy is frenetic, the jokes are piled so high that even if you don't find one funny, another good one will be coming by any second now.Please don't take the above reviews too seriously. Critics often just like to whine for the sake of whining. They are just annoyed that they didn't come up with the idea themselves.Irrelevant laid back humour, just as funny as any Wayans brothers movie, but with extra star appeal and base humour.Watch it.

Well, one could stay up all night trying to answer this question maybe after looking at the trailer, or just hearing about it online.In most of the reviews I put out, I like to give a brief synopsis, or summary of what the movie is about. With Movie 43, all I can say is that it is a big pile of TERRIBLE sketch-comedy, with little to almost no laughs at all.Most of the jokes that are put into your brain for you to decide whether they are funny or not are mostly things said about defecation, adolescence, or just plain stupidity. It is embarrassing to say that one of these sketches got a laugh out of me and it was maybe just a chuckle, and it was the LAST one. There isn't a reason to sit through this movie just to see that sketch.I can proudly say with all of my heart and belief that there is extremely funnier sketch-comedy on YouTube!The only reason this movie doesn't get a rating of 1 is because I miraculously sat through all of this movie.This movie can't even answer the question it's market advertisements ask, \"What is Movie 43?\".

The night before I looked up the reviews on this sight and I'm glad I didn't listen to the uptight idiots on this sight. Yes this movie has a lot of border line Jokes that cross the line, and yes this isn't the greatest film of all times. But if you don't have a stick up your rump and you have an open mind like me and my father and this couple behind us (who were probably in their late 30's to mid 40's) and you Enjoy Raunchy Comedy that sometimes go a bit too far but you don't care because your enjoying your self then I would go see this movie. If your someone who doesn't like obscene things then no. Now to make it really clear this movie has skits that follow this one guys goal to make a movie. So here are the plots with out spoiling it for you.I'll try to get them in order to the best of my recollection and sorry if I miss one or two.1. Girl goes on date with guy that has balls on his neck. (Was Pretty Funny) 2. Parents talk about how they home school his son and how they focus on making him feel alienated to give him the real exp which is that high school is the worst time in a young boys life. (moderately funny) 3. Girl wants her Boyfriend to Poop on her because she thinks that it shows that she trust him (Funny) 4. Ex Boyfriend and Ex Girlfriend have an obscene convo about their relationship at his work accidentally leaves mic on the whole store hears the convo. (Didn't find this one that funny.) 5. Company Tries to sell an IBabe that looks like a real naked girl kids get hurt trying to have sex with it (Funny) 6. Guy & Girl on Blind date they play a game of Truth or Dare (Pretty Funny) 8.Guy gives his friend a leprecon for his Bday Present and they try to get it to tell em' where the gold is (Funny) 9. 2 \"Tweens\" on a date at the boys house she has her first period everyone including the father freaks out.(Moderately Funny) 10. 1959 or 69 basketball team Black's vs Whites coach emphasizes they will win because \"There white and were black\" (little funny but not the best) 11. After the first set of credits there is a short between a animated cat(who's Sexually attracted to his male owner) and the Owner's girlfriend and the cat gets jealous and tries to get rid of her. (Me and my Dad's fav scene.)So if stuff like this sounds funny then go see if not try to pull that stick out of your butt because its funny don't be such a buzz kill because you want to be politically correct.

I'm unsure why the UK version was altered to include the sub plot, it hardly seemed worth it. There's nothing that holds this film together, but that's okay because just when you think it can't get any worse it's on the next sketch, The sketches themselves do vary in quality but the acting is generally very good and the surreal scripts leave you in fear of what is coming next.

I really can't blame them but if you watch this with a bit of forewarning you may get through it and walk away not too scathed. It is bizarre on more than a few levels though.The film is designed to shock and appall. It's probably aimed at 15-21 y/o's with pretty gross out humour. It's full of concepts usually never spoken about or if they're ever voiced it's probably at the end of a party where everyone's in the kitchen, has had way too much to drink and is just trying to outdo each other by taking a concept too far. Part of me thinks that's probably how the film was born. Some kudos has to go to the stars in it for...well just being in it. How they got them to sign on is amazing and how they got through the scenes with a straight face is a testament to their acting ability. In a nutshell it's an eclectic bunch of short stories that admittedly are a bit hard to watch at the time but do make you chuckle momentarily afterwards when you think back to certain moments. It is a film that's funnier when you look back on it after a decent amount of time from when you watched it.If you are a person whose somewhat easily offended then give it a miss. If on the other hand you're not shocked by gross humour then strap yourself in, you're in for a ride you won't forget too quickly.Will I toss the DVD out? No. Will I watch it again anytime soon. I haven't seen it in 18 months and I'm in no hurry to give it another spin but one day I'll revisit it. If only to be amazed at how so many stars came together in such a bizarre film. The memory of Kate Winslet's face at the dinner table just makes me laugh. As for the other scenes, I just don't think about them. Although some are pretty hard to forget.",

After witnessing this total train wreck, it's the rating the production company have expected to get on IMDb, seems now soo obvious...Sudeikis made it look like a SNL spin-off that was so bad it didn't make the cut just before going on the air, which means here 'crappier than crap'. God, pls explain here - how Halle Berry could think of taking part in this lemon of a film by completely degrading herself this way? When making fun of a traumatising situation like a teen getting her first period, you need to make sure that their is a minimum of satire in it, which is totally evacuated by the - hum - script here. Once this segment is over, all we are left with is incomfort for the teenage girl and resentment toward the scriptors.Overall, this film leaves you with the feeling that this actually could have worked if, 1st, we were still in 1982 when Kentucky Fried Movie & Amazon Women on the Moon were all over the place, and, 2nd, the too many flawed stories were supported, here and there, with some magic moments that sometimes awkwardly elevates the degree of humor - like, on Amazon Women, the st segment with Arsenio Hall was sooo powerfully hilarious that it made for a couple of boring moments to come later in the film.A movie more boring than anything else, what a shame.",

            "content": "I am not usually a fan of gross-out comedy and I usually avoid it like the plague. I still to this day have never seen any one of the American Pie movies. In fact, I make it a point to not watch any movie where the film poster font is: thick red Arial Black. I also don't watch movie trailers because they give everything away and I never read reviews until after I've seen a film. I go based on the Film Poster, Tag Line, Genre or Actor/s. Luckily, this film did not have thick red Arial font because I would have missed a fun night out.In my country we had the teenager thread storyline instead of The Pitch. The reason for the title being \"Movie 43\" is explained in this storyline. While this version sounds more entertaining than what I had read of the alternate one, it does make the film a little random. I believe this a strength in some ways and a weakness in others. The social commentary on Hollywood movies is lost in the teenagers version and it interferes with the original message of the film. However, the randomness of the teenagers storyline makes you feel like you're spending a night at home surfing the net watching videos like \"2 girls one cup\" or \"epic fails of the week\" or \"college humor\" and this I found to be a strength of this teenager storyline.Had this film been made with unknowns or actors typical in this genre it would not have been as enjoyable. There were some of these stock actors: Anna Farris, Sean W. Scott and Johnny Knoxville. I did cringe when I saw these stock actors because I was thinking \"Oh Lord, what OTT BS is gonna happen now?\" and I was right. But the thing that saved these sketches and made them funny was the inclusion of likable actors like J.B. Smoove and Gerard Butler. Other than that the rest of the stories were hilarious. Yes, the things were despicable but they could only work with these A-listers. Only Hugh Jackman could make me laugh with balls hanging from his neck, only he could do it. Only Halle Berry could make me laugh by mixing guac with her right boob. Only Richard Gere could stick his fingers in a black girl's vagina and elicit laughter. The humor doesn't necessarily come from the storyline, but from the fact that these particular actors are in the storyline. Seriously, all they needed was \"Ann Hathaway with an E\" doing a self-deprecating storyline and this would've been perfect. I would have preferred that to the Batman story.This film reminds me of the films \"Paris, Je'taime\" and \"The Ten\". A bunch of different stories directed by different directors put together. You should see this movie not for the great writing or cinematography, but for the chance to see A-listers being silly. It is thoroughly entertaining and I predict this film will become a cult classic and will make Top Ten Best lists in the years to come.",

I do NOT recommend this movie to anyone, my curiosity got the best of me & yes it is as bad as they say.

It's not made to only be funny if you have Petter Griffin's humor. This film is supposed to be funny because it's showing us how ridiculous some aspects of life are: the school system, sexism, appearances, habits etc. If you can't see the humor in that, then you probably haven't thought about much in your lifetime, and should just go back to watching something that doesn't require thought.

Its not a movie I would recommend but only some of the clips are worth watching. However, the only story line that was worth watching was the 3 kids searching for a movie that supposedly didn't exist and turns out to actually exist. Maybe the writer should explore some ideas with that short story and then donate whatever he has to a good writer who will turn it into the script of the year. LOL. I can't believe how many famous ppl they got to actually act in this movie, personally I think the one with Hugh Jackman was the funniest.",

There is little to no substance, with zero plot, but it is mildly amusing throughout the entirety of the film and benefits from the variety brought on by the abundance of skits. It has its merits, but is not more valuable than series of amusing youtube videos as a replacement.",

Yes, it's not a ten, nor a nine or a eight, BUT it's quite entertaining, especially if you don't feign offense at some of the humor, which you will most likely do if you watch this film with other humans. Due to this, I recommend watching this film by yourself or with any of your friends whom love Blazing Saddles . . . or Kentucky Fried Movie. The famous actors in this film get it, you should lighten up and get it too. Why would they purposely place themselves in a horrible film? They've read the script.

You have the overall scale, which this movie would only get a four in, and then you have the entertainment scale, which I think would earn this flick a six. The difference is in the fact that this is not a typical film; it has a little story progression, though it is truly more a series of sketches. The humor is purposefully \"crude\" and it pushes at the viewer's tolerance for indecency. Such issues as the awkwardness of first dates, addressing peculiar desires in the bedroom, and boundaries of a company's take on the old \"sex sells\" motto and pet / owner relationships are about half of the topics addressed, all in a raunchy, offensively comedic manner. Certainly not everyone's cup of tea, I none-the-less found it funny, and though at the beginning I wanted to close my eyes from sheer embarrassment, I realized that my reaction was what the movie intended. Do not watch this film if your desire is to see a favorite actor or actress, as they are all absurdly out of their normal character, parodies really, but give it a chance if you've ever thought that an SNL skit was funny, or if you can laugh at an exploding colostomy bag. Just keep in mind that though the circumstances might be bizarre, every joke has a nugget of truth, and in order to enjoy this movie, one has to see the word \"nugget\", and think \"poop\", which should then inspire laughter. If it doesn't, this movie is probably not for you.",

It's stupid comedy kinda for a lot of it, but tons of comedy is simplistic. If that's a metric for saying it's bad, it's a hypocritical one. Obviously humor is subjective though. One of the other things I dig about the movie is the shear amount of famous actors and actresses in it, many of which are doing roles you'd never imagine them stooping too, and it kind of makes me like them more. With putting in a spoiler, the opening skit with Hugh Jackman hits that one right on the head.So anyway, I'm not saying I died laughing, but once I saw this got nominated to The Razzies and I like at it's fellow companion film that were all HORRIBLE I think people need to cut this movie some slack.

Critics would have certainly been expected to pan this. That said, I'm unclear of the motives behind all involved in developing such a train-wreck.It's an amusing experience for the open minded. As the story goes, pretty much all of the actors were either guilted or coerced into participating. That in and of itself is pure gold. Knowing this before hand is not critical to enjoyment, but for those sick of the celebrity treatment it is paramount.Not one bit is a clever execution of comedy, each story seems a rather daft exploitation of it's talent. The shock value comes from witnessing A-list celebrities performing as the trained show monkeys they really are. This is where the magic happens, at least for the cynical who are sick of the shlock of Hollywood productions these days.Would I recommend Movie 43 for everyone? Certainly not.

I have found it because I was looking through the cast, as I was amazed of how many good actors took part in it, as well as I have went through reviews and seen that most of them talk about how disgusting the movie is, so I have decided to check it out and I was not disappointed! The only scene that was not really funny was with Chris Pratt, as you could see how silly it is and how it desperately tries to push out at least some kind of a joke, but otherwise, all the other scenes are brilliant. I found myself laughing at nearly every single phrase someone said. Yes, it may seem gross for someone, but who said that gross can't be funny? I just believe that many people lie about their perception of this movie, just so that they could look smarter in everybody else's eyes. I believe that it is just a tradition at this point for people to leave a bad review about this movie, without even seeing it. There were so many memes about this movie just some 10 years ago and I clearly remember them. Most of the scenes are iconic, especially Halle Berry plastic surgery and Hugh Jackman nutsack. The plot starts off not very entertaining, as you await it's silliness, but afterwards it skyrockets you into the darkest humor possible. A very strong, very brave comedy analogue of which you will never find ever again. It is still a mystery on how so many good actors agreed on taking part in such a stupid movie with such a low budget. Definitely worth checking this out, an 8/10, still relevant, still hilarious.",

            "content": "Omnibus films featuring big names can work as long as the product works well, but Movie 43 fails as it combines the series of shorts into one narrative. There are two versions of the film: One takes place in a producer's conference and the other takes place at a teenager's home before an apocalypse. Some segments have missing payoffs like the one where a grocery clerk Neil (Kiernan Culkin) falls in love with Veronica (Emma Stone) or Batman (Jason Sedakis) giving dating advice to Robin (Justin Long). Others, like the one where Beth (Kate Winslet) goes on a date with millionaire Davis (Hugh Jackman), the one where Amanda (Chloe Moretz) experiences her first menstrual cycle, and the one where a man (Chris Pratt) takes laxatives to show his love for his fianc\u00e9e (Anna Faris) are just an excuse to throw out gross-out jokes. Meanwhile, it throws in socio-political commentary in these sketches, like the sexist ad executive (Richard Gere) pitching the product iBabe to his staff or the 1950's coach (Terrence Howard) teaching the first all-black basketball team. However, other segments are okay, like the game of truth of dare between Stephen Merchant and Halle Berry, the one featuring a gay cartoon cat or a birthday present involving a leprechaun (Gerard Butler). You know your project is in trouble when you title it Movie 43 because these rejected CollegeHumor sketches seem like they were filmed before the producers came up with the title. It especially doesn't work when they bookend these vignettes with a lazy and last minute narrative. I do not object to shock and gross-out comedy, in fact, as a teen, I watched a good chunk of lowbrow shows like \"Robot Chicken\" and \"Family Guy.\" Whereas those were handled with contextual intelligence, Movie 43 is a limp, desperate attempt from over fifteen directors to throw every adult humor on the screen resulting in a giant mess.

I wished to see a romance scene between Anna Faris and Chris Pratt (they were together at the time), but it involves poop (just not for me). And you could say something similar about all 12 sketches.\n\nWhile I might recommend this if it was a series of internet videos, it's just not a movie.

After pitching the first of his thirteen offbeat fables, the dejected artist forces the rest of his disjointed allegory on the executive at gunpoint...\n\n\"Movie 43\" was panned by critics, with Richard Roeper calling it \"the Citizen Kane of awful\", joining others who labeled it as one of the worst films of all time. The film won three awards at the 34th Golden Raspberry Awards, including Worst Picture. Rotten Tomatoes consensus states: \"A star-studded turkey, Movie 43 is loaded with gleefully offensive and often scatological gags, but it's largely bereft of laughs.\" IGN's Gregg Katzman gave the film a 1/10, with the main criticisms being its unfunny jokes and the waste of its all star cast, and the only positive being its sub two hour running time. It would go on to tie with Scary Movie 5 for worst movie of 2013. In his guest review for Roger Ebert's website, Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times outright panned the film, giving it zero out of four stars, calling it \"aggressively tasteless\", and going so far as to say \"Movie 43 is the Citizen Kane of awful\". He wrote that the film has nothing in common with The Groove Tube and The Kentucky Fried Movie, two \"very funny and influential\" sketch-comedy films. He additionally criticized Movie 43 for what he calls \"female humiliation\", saying that although the men are \"jerks, idiots, dolts and fools\", the women have it even worse. Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph described Farrelly's film as \"the work of a confused man thrashing around in an industry he no longer understands\". Peter Howell of the Toronto Star gave the film zero out of four stars and called it the worst film he had ever seen. Elizabeth Weitzman of the New York Daily News gave it a negative review, saying, \"As a film critic, I've seen nearly 4,000 movies over the last fifteen years. Right now, I can't think of one worse than Movie 43.\"\n\n\"Movie 43\" (The title of the film has no actual meaning to it) was filmed over a span of four years. Production took so long because filming had to be done around the actors' busy schedules. Not screened in advance for critics, because Rouge Pictures was afraid of bad reviews making audiences miss the film. The film was ultimately considered as one of the worst films ever made. I have honestly no idea what I had seen when I finished the film. It\u00b4s a turkey that died several years ago and somebody dug it up from the grave. I can\u00b4t imagine any of the actors were pleased with this mess, however I reckon that is kind of clear since none of the major actors wanted to promote it when it came out. With a cast consisting of for example Emma Stone, Hugh Jackman, Chris Pratt, Uma Thurman, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Halle Berry and Elizabeth Banks, you would think that this might have something to offer at least. But, no.... \"Movie 43\" is a disaster from all angles. I simply can\u00b4t describe it nor understand it. It\u00b4s just offensive, stupid, unfunny and pointless.",

Deck the halls with bowels of holly.\n\nGREG: Movie 43 almost defies explanation. It is an anthology of sixteen (16!) different storylines. Each one raunchier and more ridiculous than the last. The running gag in the movie is that each scene is actually a pitch for a movie idea by struggling screenwriter Charlie Wessler (Dennis Quaid). He s holding a movie producer Griffin Schraeder (Greg Kinear) hostage forcing him to listen to each and every story idea, regardless of how horrible it may be.\n\nSCOTT: And man, are the stories horrible.  And dumb, and ultra-vulgar.  At gunpoint, Schraeder brings Wessler s movie idea to the studios chief executive, who ridicules and embarrasses Schraeder.  To get even, Schraeder decides to invest huge resources into the film, knowing it will cost the movie studio millions.\n\nGREG: I don t think we ll have time to review all the stories here. But to give you an idea, the first one deals with a woman (Kate Winslet) on a blind date with a surprisingly eligible bachelor (Hugh Jackman). The only problem: he has testicles on his chin and nobody but she seems to notice. Then there s the one where a girlfriend (Anna Faris) is so in love with her boyfriend (Chris Pratt) that she wants him to poop on her chest. He, in his desire to do the deed properly, eats enormous amounts of Indian food and overdoses on laxatives. The end result is the most massive explosion of diarrhea in film history.\n\nSCOTT: Yes.  For this scene, I thank the makers of this film from the bottom of my.... well, from my bottom. The premise of Movie 43 pretty much guarantees the movies failure.  We know that Wessler s ideas are terrible as he is pitching them to Schraeder, and yet 95% of Movie 43 is spent showing these bad ideas in their full, ahem, glory.  At one point, Wessler suggests that Kate Winslet play the role of the chin-balls  date, to which Schraeder points out that Winslet would never agree to such a role.  But in this movie, where ridiculous reigns supreme, Winslet does indeed play this character. Movie 43 is full of hits and misses, and unfortunately, the ratio of hits to misses is about 1 to 4.  Much of the content of the skits is revolting and bloated with shock value.  Nothing is sacred here.  Jokes about incest, menstruation, and feces abound.  The more outrageous, the better.  In any bad movie, vulgarity is a proxy for good writing, and that s certainly true here.\n\nGREG: Movie 43 comes to us from Peter Farrelly of the Farrelly Brothers (who brought us last years The Three Stooges). The Farrellys are known for their low-brow humor and Movie 43 seals that reputation. This is the worst movie ever - but that is what it is aiming for. Many of the actors originally slated to be in the film found a way to opt-out. It took nearly 10 years to bring the whole picture together as reluctant luminaries were brought in to fulfill their obligations. There is no rhyme nor reason to these vignettes. Although I get the impression that several of them were actual movie synopses that were turned down. If you like Saturday Night Live, you just might like Movie 43. However watching 90 minutes of SNL rejects may be more than you can take. Still, knowing is half the battle. I found Movie 43 delivered on its promise to be lewd, crude, and indecent. And I respect that. I give Movie 43 1 Reel out of 5. No heroes were harmed in the making of Movie 43 so I award it 0 Heroes out of 5. Movie: Hero:\n\nSCOTT: Anthology movies rarely work because there is insufficient time to develop characters and storylines.  Each story is reduced to a single thematic gimmick that is milked for about 5 or 10 minutes and then runs out of steam.  And if the gimmick is truly dumb to begin with, 5 or 10 minutes feels like forever.  The iBabe story is an example of a bad idea that went nowhere.  It s one long sexual joke dragged out to 10 minutes.  Ugh.  Then theres the aforementioned defecation story.  While the idea of pooping on someone is shocking and perhaps even mildly funny, we re subjected to this fecal theme for 10 tortuous minutes.  No thank you. Movie 43 is 90 minutes of shocking attempts at humor that are clever at times but miss the mark far too often.  The conflict between Schraeder and Wessler was uninteresting and served as a bad, bad excuse to film so many truly tasteless mini-stories.  Like you, Greg, I award Movie 43 just 1 measly Reel, with the film on the reel donated to the exploding-bowel man to use as toilet paper.  There were no heroes here, only victims.  And so zero Heroes out of 5 from me, too.",

But, why would like 50 A-list stars want to be in it? Answer: Because it's funny. Get past the unusual format and just want expect to laugh, you will. I watch a lot of comedies and I've been pretty disappointed a lot recently. I can say this movie has more laughs than most that I've seen recently.

I almost want to blame everyone in this movie and ask why they did it? But seeing all these people in this movie, I'm convinced this was someone calling in a favor. Maybe it was like the nephew of a distribution company. \n\nThe plot is about as lazy as you can get for a movie. A crazed Dennis Quaid is pitching these rejected MadTV sketches to Greg Kinnear. Forcing Kinnear to listen at gunpoint, until some little moment between Kinnear and Common becomes the focus of the plot. The end of the movie becomes the \"a movie about filming a movie\" trope, someone yells cut and then it just kind of ends. But then there's another short. And then it ends.\n\nEveryone of the shorts is directed by someone else. So there is zero continuity in between any of the scenes. Yes, by the movie's standard, this is a crazy person writing these, but actually it is not because they break fourth wall at the end. So Quaid isn't actually crazy, they are filming a movie in which Quaid plays a crazy person. So what's the point of that? To tell you that you watched shitty comedic sketches for an hour all because it was a dream...er....it was all a movie? Boo.\n\nAll these shorts reminded me of horrible improv scenes. The scene between Knoxville and Stiffler is the one that comes to mind. The scene starts with these guys as bros who live together. Knoxville apologizes for fucking Stiffler's girlfriend. Then Knoxville makes a joke about his apology. But this douchebag has a surprise for Stiffler. Knoxville captured a leprechaun for Stiffler so he could have the best birthday ever. This is going to be the best day ever. WOOOOO. \n\nPretty much every other skit was the same. But let's not skip over some important cinematic performances. For example, Hugh Jackman having CGI balls on his neck and Kate Winslet agreeing to be in a scene where Hugh Jackman has balls for chins. There was Halle Berry smashing guacamole with her tit and Stephen Merchant becoming a racist asian stereotype. There was the  cartoon cat that wanted to fuck Josh Duhamel. \n\nEven when there were laughs, the scene would go an extraordinary length to kill its own joke. Terrance Howard is a coach of an all black basketball team in the 1950s. The whole joke is that the students are unsure of their skills as this is the first white team they are playing, and basically Terrance Howard is just reinforcing the stereotype that black people can outball white people. Okay concept, but this sketch lasted so long. This reminded me of a reject Chappelle show sketch. \n\nEvery scene of this movie is offensive. Whether it be because of how offensively stereotypical or juvenile the comedy is, or just how lazy the dialog or the filming is.",

If you ask me what Movie 43 is about, I don't know how to answer. All I can say is that Movie 43 has a bunch of funny (sometimes it isn't even funny) YouTube clips played by stars all combined into a full-length movie. \n\tFirst of all, I would rather watched a bunch of videos on YouTube that I would enjoy rather than watching this. Each clip in Movie 43 has nothing to do with one another, not even a link. All it gives you is a crappy premise that a bunch of ass-kids are finding Movie 43 and that it will end the world. Seriously, nothing makes sense in this movie. It involves time traveling, apocalypse, and explosions that will just leave you thinking WTF. \n\tOne thing that I hated the most is that how did so many celebrities ended up in this movie? In the first clip, Kate Winslet is having a dinner date with Hugh Jackman who got balls hanging on his chin. C'mon Hollywood, having an Oscar- nominated actor and an Oscar winning actress in this garbage isn't a good idea. All I can say is that Hugh Jackman does have balls taking this role.\nBasically, each clip after the first one is either the same level with the first or even worse. I might even considering the first one as one of the funnier ones. Later in the movie, you got Naomi Watts and Leiv Schreiber humiliating their homeschooling son, Chris Pratt shitting on Anna Faris, Johnny Knoxville and Seann William Scott kidnapping Leprechauns for gold coins, and Halle Berry making guacamole with her boobs.\n That's all you got from Movie 43 and now I spoiled it so that you won't have to see this movie. You're going to thank me later. Just sayin'.",

The story is about a desperate writer pitching the worst movie idea ever and forcing a studio executive to listen under gunpoint.  Each segment is worse than the last with their themes of violence, extreme bathroom humor, immorality, and things too explicit to discuss in this review.  It amazes me that thirteen directors managed to create such a distasteful series of shorts.  You would have to consider this an anti-movie without an ounce of entertainment value.  It is criminal that they were able to get the following list of stars to appear:\nDennis Quaid, Greg Kinnear, Seth MacFarlane (well, no surprise there), Hugh Jackman, Kate Winslet, Naomi Watts, Liev Schreiber, Anna Faris, Chris Pratt, Emma Stone, Justin Long, Jason Sudeikis, Uma Thurman, Kristen Bell, Richard Gere, Kate Bosworth, Jack McBrayer, Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz, Patrick Warburton, leprechaun Gerard Butler, Johnny Knoxville (again, no surprise), Seann William Scott, Halle Berry, Terrence Howard, Elizabeth Banks\nReading this cast list, you have to wonder how they could combine for such an unpleasant filmgoing experience.  The pointless 90 minutes of crude, obscene, offensive material drags on and on without reprieve.  Some of the actors tried to get out of it but they were stuck.  I watched this film out of curiosity, having developed an appreciation for terrible movies like \"Birdemic\" over the years.  This is not like that.  Instead of it being so bad that it is entertaining, \"Movie 43\" is so bad that it will make you question whether you want to watch another movie ever again.",

However, none of those movies come close to the mind-numbingness, atrociousness, and god-awfulness of Movie 43. For the ones who seen this movie, I feel your pain. For the ones who did not see this movie, thank god for you. However, I am going to explain the plot (if you want to call it a plot). \n\nIt is basically follows a mad producer (Dennis Quaid) who pitches his ideas to a executive producer (Greg Kinnear) who is put into gun point because he did not want to put his ideas into film. The ideas is basically of shorts including Hugh Jackman and Kate Winslet going on a date and Winslet sees Jackman with a set of privates hanging from his chin. And Terrence Howard is lecturing his team on how they going to beat this white team because they are black. And the movie also have little informercials (if you want to call them informercials). And there ten or maybe eleven skits that I did not. Why? Because they are not worth for me to mention.\n\nWell, Movie 43 is easily one of the of the worst movies in recent memory. It is so baffling that a \"movie\" like this gets made and release into theaters for everybody to see. The segments, skits, shorts, or whatever you want to call them (if you seen the movie). They are not funny what so ever. The only funny (or somewhat funny) skit, segment, short, and etc. in Movie 43 is (the one that I just mention) the one with Terrence Howard. Yes, it goes to racial stereotyping but it is the one that made me laugh or chuckle. The worst goes to the one involving Josh Duhamel having a cartoon cat who falls in love with him and is coming between Duhamel and Elizabeth Banks (who is one of the directors sadly).\n\nAnother thing that is baffling about Movie 43 besides it has been in production for 3-4 years is the fact that there is such much talent wasted and embarrassing themselves. Most of them were nominated for or won an Oscar or maybe an Academy. It is such a shame that Movie 43 could have been decent or a guilty pleasure but it is not. If anyone have any common sense, please avoid Movie 43 like the plague. It is a waste of time, money, and talent. You will be upset like I was.",

Most of the time it wasn't funny anyway.\n\nBeing a collection of skits has some positives, but mostly negatives. A lot of comedies suffer from being able to be funny at first, but lose steam as things progress. By breaking it up into many stories, had the jokes been good, the writers wouldn't have had to ignore a lack of jokes for the sake of moving the plot forward. It mostly sucks though that there's no time to build up lasting, memorable characters, and that there's little sense of progression.

The gags are obvious and childish and vulgar. The acting, especially considering the pedigree, is somewhat static in that nothing ever evolves. And all in all, the direction of everyone involved is simply rendered moot. Plainly put: this is not a well made film. And yet, I still felt like it retained some of the aesthetic of regular Hollywood comedies. I sat through the whole thing and you know what? I laughed. It was just so ironic that these sublime actors were in such a ridiculously awful film. Somehow that made it better. At about this point in my review I have about 98% of the world at my house with pitchforks and torches. But, and I know this is actually off putting for many of you, it seemed like they were all having fun. Nobody seemed stressed or anxious. I just don't think it's one of the worst films ever, although please don't think I'm arguing the opposite. Up there with catwoman, batman and robin and transformers films? I simply don't think so. It's actually weird, because these are usually films I despise with every bone in my body and it gave me good reason to as well.

I really believe that many of the stars are putting honest effort into their sketches, trying to make them funny, but it's still evident that they are embarrassed to be there. The best sketch in the film is Emma Stones, because it's short and actually approaches something like comedy. The worst would either have to be the iBabe or Halle Berry's and Stephen Merchent's truth or dare sketch. The ibabe one was a little bit sexist and the Truth or dare was just embarrassing.

But curiosity got the better of me and I decided to give it a viewing. There are 3 types of movies; there are good movies, bad movies and a small fraction of bad movies that are so bad that they can be enjoyed with the right mindset. Funnily enough, Movie 43 is the latter. Let me start off by saying this movie is not for everyone; only for a small audience who likes incredibly ridiculous vulgar and immature humour. The movie's broken up into various segments of scenes played out by famous actors with a backdrop of a ridiculous plot that isn't even worth mentioning. The thing about it is; some of the scenes were actually funny. I could have just been in the mood to watch it, but some made me laugh out loud. Highlights were the superhero segment, Hugh Jackman who seems to be able to make even balls on a neck funny, amongst others. The movie's so disgusting that I don't expect people to make it through the first half hour. I have no idea how they convinced so many big names to take part in this movie but if it weren't for them, I probably wouldn't have watched it. But with every funny part, there is a really bad part. Some segments were just trying too hard or not funny at all, and they ended the movie on a weird note. It crossed some lines making fun of racism and child abuse, which is probably one of the reasons why it didn't go over well with critics; that and well, the fact that it's not a good movie. This is a special genre of movie that comes along every once in a while that's so bad that if approached in the right way, can actually make it watchable. But for everyone else; avoid. 3/10",

Not *really*. It's a collection of comedy sketches featuring various celebrities. If you wanted to see a movie that has a great cast, this is not one of them. No matter how many times they throw names at you, don't believe it. These highly recognized celebrities make an appearance, but only a few at a time. They don't all tie into a single story and you don't see all of them work together.\n\nI've already stated that this \"movie\" is just a collection of short films. Now about the quality of the individual films. There's quite a few of them, but only one or two will actually be worth a few laughs. The rest are painfully unfunny and poorly written, so bad that it becomes embarrassing to watch some of these actors and actresses. \n\nThe whole point of including recognizable names is to give them characters that people will go see. Here there is virtually no characterization, not that there would be any time for it anyway. Our favorite actors are only here for a few minutes to play a small part and then just like that, they're gone. On top of being short-lived, most of the sketches aren't even funny. And for the ones that are; I'm sure you could find them on YouTube or something.\n\nOverall, \"Movie 43\" is not very funny and it's really wasting a great group of actors.

This movie is so bad that there is not enough booze in the world to help you forget about it and believe me I tried. The fact that any actor would be a part of this movie must have either been desperate for a quick pay check or wanted to have a shitty movie on their resume portfolio. I have never had an experience watching a film quite like this in my entire...FUCKING...LIFE! And this is coming from someone who has seen A LOT of bad movies in my life thus far. I hope that as I post this review today that I would save as many lives as I can from wasting their precious hours on a piece of shit movie like this. Movie 43 has finally done it making me believe that not only is this the worst movie of 2013, but it is officially in my Top 15 worst films of all time. It really does exceed your tolerance for every single sin that you can possibly think of in a movie and tests the very core of how you watch a bad movie. You know what; I am going to spare you the usual lengthy review for today and just straight up tell you what I thought about this film. The plot sucks, the characters in here suck, the jokes suck, and everything about this (as a whole) sucks major big dicks! This movie sucks dick so much that it sucks dick at sucking dick, that's how bad I think it is. What's even more amazing is that not only were they able to acquire of handful of A-list celebrities and waste their God given talent on this movie, but the fact that this film ever made it off the green light and into the big screen is uncanny to me. This movie needs to burn in Hell along with the many writers who wrote this movie. Fuck this movie and fuck everything about it!",

In the cinema the shock value was what sold it to me, the star power and outrageous laughs had me and my mates leaving the cinema in stitches, but a year on the jokes are wearing thin and becoming less and less funny and being more of a chore to watch. As the months have gone by and a few more viewings the score has gradually sunk and now it's at my lowest score of 50%, and most likely to get lower and lower.\r\n\r\nThe structure is one of the main problems, there are two stories that set up the skits. There is \"The Pitch\", starring Greg Kinnear and Dennis Quaid, and then the other one with annoying teenagers trying to find the most banned videos online. These two different segments couldn't be anymore outlandish and disjointed, they literally have the weakest link to introducing Movie 43's skits, yet in all it's outrageous greatness The Pitch is mildly entertaining and a whole lot more tolerable than the scenes with the teens. \r\n\r\nThis bad pitch sees Dennis Quaid introduce his new film which consists of different stars in different situations, claiming that it's a family movie which is funny because it really isn't. As he divulges into his \"masterpiece lining up to be the next Howard The Duck\", the skits in begin. That's it, there's no underlying story or reason for it all, it's pure shock value and tastelessness, do not watch it with family. The worst part is the scene where you actually see Quaid and Kinnear in the parking lot, and the camera turns to the crew where Farrelly makes a quip, never before has a joke been so flat and unfunny. Here come the skits.\r\n\r\nAn all-star humiliate themselves and act like you've never seen before, almost down to the standards of a Rob Schneider flick, that didn't attract me to the movie but what did was the insane cast list, and I won't lie but I laughed an awful lot. The opening with Kate Winslet and Hugh Jackman is unlike anything you've ever seen, it left me speechless, I didn't see it coming. The homeschool skit with Naomi Watts and Liev Schrieber is cringe and rather twisted, and the i-Babe skit is raucously funny, Kate Bosworth acts as if she has just realised what movie she has got herself involved with. You shouldn't laugh at Movie 43, but I did, the truth or dare with Halle Berry and Stephen Merchant is priceless for all the wrong reasons. This movie scooped up several Razzies and rightfully so, there's no craft or attention to any detail here, just one big joke wrapped up into a 90 minute movie that seems even longer. I'm one of the few that liked this and its crudeness yet it barely defines the saying \"so bad it's good\", it has much bad about yet there are some glimmers of good slapped around.",

Third segment is plane stupid with the word poop as the main theme of a relationship. Fourth segment is SOOO sexually offensive, that they had to mention church in it. Fifth segment is a offensive parody of a naked women and a apple product called \"ibabe\", which the Apple Company would  sue the crap out this film for showing there product being made fun of. The six segment I couldn't even describe, so I stop the film from there. That's how horrible Movie 43 is. It's so bad that I couldn't finish it.

Movie 43 is not only the worst movie I've seen so far this year, but it is also one of the worst movies I've seen in a while, this movie has racism, stupid sexual humour which is really dumb and apparently is funny, and terrible acting which is surprising with people like Hugh Jackman and Emma Stone.  This movie basically have the shittiest skits that are obviously trying to rip off Saturday Night Live but in every worst way possible. If a studio doesn't care, Why should I?\n\nTo sum up Movie 43 is a really shitty comedy that I do not recommend anything about it. This might even be the worst movie I've ever seen. This movie is torture, its like child abuse, its that bad. Thanks a lot Hollywood for making a shit movie.\n\n1/10 - Torture",

            "content": "Movie 43 is a waste of effort for me. I didn't enjoy every minute of everything this garbage depicted. I checked it out on netflix so I could come up with my own opinion about it. I knew it was going to be a bad movie, but I wanted to see why everyone didn't like it. Upon seeing it, I have come to a conclusion that the reason this movie was made was because the people were desperate for money. By having all those all-star actors/actress in play, it was obvious they cared less about making a good enough story and jokes, and cared more about the A-List cast. Most of them are pretty talented, but they were all waisted here.\n\nNow where should I start? I guess the plot. Unfortunately, it didn't have a story. It follows two guys who are desperately trying to get their script approved by a producer who keeps denying it, after he discovers that each skits are offensive, and that it lacks meaning. That's right, the movie is a series of skits that are totally gross, unfunny, and illogical. I only laughed twice throughout the whole movie, but that still didn't say much. \n\nThe movie seemed like it was made by someone who saw two girls and one cup and most of the spoof movies from this generation. Most of the skits deals with potty humor, genitals, sex, and many other junk. Of course it's a rated-R movie, meaning the filmmakers are free to do whatever they want, but adding a lot of female breasts, poop jokes, sex, and a bunch of F-Bombs don't make a comedy movie funny. I did not laugh at anything that happened here, except for the two skit that were slightly funny. The one where the parents were treating their homeschooled son like crap, and the last one where Terrance Howard's character talked about racism in a basketball game made me chuckled, but that was it. \n\nThe movie was so disgusting, it made me feel totally grossed out. Most of the moments from the film were too gross to look at. I'm not going to bother describing the ones that were nasty to me because I don't want to be reminded. The only good thing about me seeing it on netflix is that I didn't have to pay for it. Sure it was a waste of time on my part, but it was better than wasting my money on a film that I didn't find worthwhile.\n\nI couldn't believe the A-List actors/actress agreed to be in this movie. If I was one of those people, I would reject it as soon as possible. They were all wasted here. There wasn't a single cast member that stood out to me. This wasn't the first movie to add people in a higher status. Valentine's Day did it, then comes New Years Eve. Talk about having to try too hard to appeal teenagers and 20somethings.\n\nAs a whole, I didn't enjoy it. This is just as bad as most of Adam Sandler's newer movies. I'd rather watch Key and Peele than having to spend a little over an hour and a half seeing this piece of filth. At least they know how to make better skits and humor than this so-called comedy. If you want to see a comedy movie that's smart and hilarious, you will not find it here. It would be rediculous for me to hear someone says it's funny because it's not.",

Stubbornly refusing to rise above humor we all left back in middle school, it shoves one overdone \"joke\" in our face after another, painfully stretching the often mean-spirited skits into 10 minutes or more when 10 seconds would have been too much. We are treated to crass, overly offensive attempts at comedy involving literally nothing besides bodily functions, body parts and long-winded, poorly acted monologues. After 55 minutes in, I turned it off, because if this was all the movie had to show me for the first bulk of the run time the rest of it was likely just as worthless. \nOne of my questions about this piece of garbage will eternally be, how did they get these people to be in this film? Did Hugh Jackman really think it was that inspired, original and hilarious to film a horrifically stupid scene revolving completely around his genitals being on his neck? In case we didn't see your balls dip into the gravy the first time, Hugh, luckily the directors zoomed close up several times so we could witness every moment of rib-cracking hilarity. I, for one, have never seen a finer sequence in a movie than when a pubic hair fell into your bowl and you (did he actually do that?! OMG) accidentally ate it! Hilarious.\n\nMovie 43 is the epitome of everything that is wrong with Hollywood, and Brett Ratner is the Tommy Wiseau of comedy. This is six million dollars of money that literally would have been put to better use being thrown randomly off of rooftops. When someone asks me why the stereotype of fat, stupid americans exists, all I have to do is point them to this movie. With an absolute plethora of completely moronic skits and a stupid underlying plot that doesn't even attempt to tie the stupid skits together, one has to wonder what comedy geniuses such as Seth MacFarlane are doing in this garbage. Although the skits are drawn out 10 minutes or oftentimes longer, they wouldn't be funny even in the shortest Family Guy cutaway gag, and Seth, I'm sure, is well aware of this. His constant look of consternation implies an ulterior motive that begins with Pay and ends with Check. Others, like McLovin, simply flail around wildly, their career speeding down the drain with every passing, painful second. \n\nIf you just can't get enough of entire segments revolving around Anna Faris begging Chris Pratt to defecate on her, if you burst into hysterical laughter every time you hear the words \"poop,\" or \"balls,\" or if you guffaw even at the thought of a young girl having her first period at a friend's house, Movie 43 is the perfect movie for you. The rest of us would rather keep our brain cells. It is with great honor that I officially declare Movie 43 The Worst Movie of 2013.",

However, this film is a lazily slapped-on product from people who's idea of comedy is farting directly in your face and expecting you to enjoy it as you give them your money. It's a horrendous horror show -- filled with the most preposterous attempts at comedy with a cast that makes it all the more painful to watch. If the sight of a cartoon cat masturbating at a photo album of his owner, and later on humping a stuffed teddy bear while throbbing a giant comb in his rectum makes you even chuckle in the slightest, then perch down and enjoy for what is the most pitiful attempts at comedy in recent memory.",

Any one of these sketches would *kill* on SNL, but when they try to make a movie about of them, suddenly we're all too classy for this sort of humor. I for one - along with the actors in this film - don't have my nose quite so high in the air yet that I can't enjoy an old fashioned raunch-fest every once in a while.

If you seriously want to waste your time, money and effort on one of the biggest shitstorms in movie history...Movie 43. But first a little history- the bastards who made this piece of shit apparently said they wanted a movie-length version of online sketch comedies such as FunnyorDie and so they got as many actors as possible. Some accepted the script thinking it was really funny, some instantly declined and others were forced by the studios; how sad where most of them will hopefully have this film as the lowest point in their career! Not only that, if you want to want to make a movie that resembles online sketch comedies like FunnyorDie, fine but do it in a way that makes sense and not in a way that is so off-putting and offensive! And did I mention this thing has a story as well? Apparently it's about some guy whose younger brother keeps pranking him so him and his best friend get their revenge on the brother by saying that there's a worldwide banned movie out there called Movie 43 and he has to look for it so therefore he comes across these clips that I swear to god if I ever watch them again, I will turn that thing off instantly! One gag involves Kate Winslet on a blind date where he meets Hugh Jackman who has testicles on his neck- that's not funny! That's disgusting! Another gag involves Naomi Watts and Liev Schreiber as parents and they treat their house in a high-school environment because of their teenage boy- get it? Because he's a teenager and therefore they treat him and the house like he's in high school? Another involves Chris Pratt being forced to do a cleveland steamer on his bitch played by Anna Faris and he is told by his friends during a barbecue that if he does a poop then she's his soulmate and if he does a shit, then she's his whore and it ends with Chris Pratt shitting all over some guy's car. This was just unfunny and boring as hell. And if Chris Pratt doesn't bring me his A-game as Star Lord in Guardians Of The Galaxy in 2014, he will officially blow! Another involves Halle Berry playing Truth or Dare with some guy I don't care about and it was just unbearable to watch! There's a fucking slogan on the poster asking you \"What is Movie 43?\" and the answer is obviously nothing! This movie is just a big piece of nothing! It is just a bunch of horrible clips put together with no story, no context, no whatsoever! Oh and at the end of the movie, Some bad guys warn the teenage douchebags that if they find this movie, the world will end but they find it as it somehow exists for real and an apocalypse arrives and kills everyone except for the older brother who survives in a wheelchair with a cripple and finds his laptop with a cracked screen and watches Terrence Howard give a basketball speech- for fuck's sake quit dragging it out and end this damn thing! You know if this was supposed to be the gross-out comedy special, then Adam Sandler is god compared to this! I don't expect to walk into this thinking a gross-out comedy that is actually funny OK! To be honest, I like gross-out comedies; The American Pie series were hilarious, Ted was hilarious and some of Seth Rogen's comedies such as Knocked Up, Superbad, Pineapple Express and more recently This Is The End were great but this movie doesn't know what it wants to be and therefore crams everything in, throws everything at us and thinks we can take it. Overall Movie 43 is a disgusting, unpleasant, uncomfortable, queasy, sickening, non-sensical, abominational piece of trash that you should steer away from and I know you will obviously watch it to think what the hell am I even saying AND let's hope they don't make a Movie 43: The Sequel, Movie 44 and Movie 45! Movie 43 gets a Some Old Bullshit/10 and I'm tired from bitching at this movie!",

            "content": "I decided to incur the wrath of the internet today. I have never been interested in contrarianism for its own sake; I have never defended or criticized a film that I didn't feel strongly about. It is with this outlook that I say Movie 43, a sketch film that has earned universal derision from the public and from critics, wasn't the worst movie I've ever seen.\r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong: Movie 43 is terrible. Some intrepid writers have tried to give the film credit as meta-commentary on the state of Hollywood, but I caution those fine cinephiles that such endeavors are a waste of precious time and effort. Judging by its haphazard production process, it seems little thought went into Movie 43 whatsoever. It is most shocking to know that the Farrelly brothers had anything to do with this film. Remember their loving homage to dimwitted comedy stars of days past in Dumb and Dumber? Or the charming fraternal saga of conjoined twins in Stuck on You? Or how about the nostalgia trip that was The Three Stooges?\r\n\r\nBut then, I would hesitate to call this a Farrelly brothers film in the first place. Although they specialize in gross-out humor, Peter and Bobby Farrelly have surprisingly tasteful style. Movie 43 just doesn't show that restraint and sensitivity, separating it from a true Farrelly effort. The movie also features twelve other directors. The brothers themselves only directed the storyline featuring Greg Kinnear and Dennis Quaid, a thread not even present in foreign cuts of the films. It is unfortunate that the Farrelly name is attached to this disaster, but I would hope that any discerning viewer would know that the fault lies at the feet of more than just two people.\r\n\r\nGoodness knows there's more than enough fault to go around. I think I chuckled twice during the entire film. Once was at the sheer novelty of seeing the talented Hugh Jackman and Kate Winslet engage in some of the basest material I've ever seen on-screen - that didn't last. Later, Liev Schreiber and Naomi Watts elicit a brief smile with their unorthodox parenting methods. I would hesitate to call either of these scenes funny, but they get a few points for not making me roll my eyes in irritation. The rest of the sketches feel like they were pulled straight out of conversations on middle school playgrounds, which should give you an idea how piercingly intellectual they are. They were designed to shock and appall, but I mostly found myself hanging my head in dejected silence.\r\n\r\nIt almost pains me to say that Movie 43 somehow isn't without its redeeming features. While its myriad sketches all toe the line between awful and dick-wilting, they thankfully fly by at breakneck speed. Ironically, Movie 43 has a better grasp on the problem of one-note gags than the modern incarnation of Saturday Night Live. Where the latter hammers on one joke for far too long, Movie 43 offers quick respite from its sporadic terribleness. Note that this is faint praise, because at least Saturday Night Live is sometimes funny.\r\n\r\nAs sad as it is, that is what keeps Movie 43 from finding kin with the worst Hollywood abominations. Where Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer seem to have come up with their films over lunch, Movie 43 exhibits minor foresight with its random sight gags and loosely connected sketches. Likewise, Happy Madison films like Grandma's Boy find themselves stuck on one godawful premise which they beat bloody until all you can do is pray it ends soon. Movie 43 features similarly prepubescent stories, but no single thread lasts the full 90 minutes. None of these factors make this a good movie, but they offer a baby step up from the bottom of the barrel.\r\n\r\nThe issue with Movie 43 isn't its sub-par content or its desperate offensiveness. No, the real issue is that it offers absolutely nothing to the world of comedy. By extension, I doubt it will add anything to your life. If movies are meant to tap into a universal sense of empathy, as Roger Ebert once said, this movie does exactly nothing right. But it is fast paced and brief, a fleeting thought in the grand scheme of cinematic history. If you hate it, rest assured that it will be erased from our collective consciousness in short order. If you love it, well - I'm sure you'll figure out which shapes go in which holes soon enough. Third grade is waiting for you.\r\n\r\nMovie Verdict: Fail\r\nRT Score: 30%\r\n\r\nLink to Full Review: http://wp.me/p4dFgD-18D\r\n\r\n~ S\u00f8ren",

It's one of the stupidest movies I've ever seen but I giggled once (I'll get into that later)This is a horribly made, stupid, uneven and beyond a WTF-fest. Every joke is completely immature and inane, completely relying on \"offensive\" jokes. It's one of the stupidest movies I've ever seen but I giggled once (I'll get into that later) but I felt like my IQ dropped 100 points afterwards. It's not necessarily due to the raunchy humor, (though that was a factor) but mostly how the entire film was witless and relied on childish jokes involving feces, bodily fluids, language and mild bestiality and incest. Some sketches were just horrendous and some were just awful. (Which one is worse? Exactly.) These are all DISGUSTING, crude, and void of any wit at all. I can laugh at crude; 21 Jump Street, Ted, and This is the End made me cry with laughter, but these are the worst things I have ever had to endure.\r The one with Anna Faris and Chris Pratt was unbearably awful and made me want to shoot myself in the face; it's just one \"joke\" about how gross they can make dialogue about coprophilia, all while seemingly trying to harm the audience's intelligence. The iBabe sketch was really bad given how terminally stupid it was, as was the Beezel sketch given its terminal velocity of terribleness. I was disappointed by the Homeschooled sketch because the idea is actually very funny: two parents harassing their home schooled child in order to give him a true high school experience. However, that went past when it was funny and just became uncomfortable given the jokes about child abuse and mother-son and father-son incest. It truly could have been hilarious, but it just made me want to leave due to how mean-spirited and void of wit it was.\r Because this is a series of sketches, the characters aren't actual characters, just actors due to the non-existent plot and non-existent character development. The cast is good, so you're watching screen saying, \"That's not a character, but it's just Emma Stone, who I really like.\" Right after that, you become overrun with an unspeakable amount of pity and depression in regards to how all of these amazing actors and actresses are in this: the worst movie of all time. (Keep in mind that I've seen Jack and Jill and Piranha 3DD.) Speaking of Emma Stone, her sketch was the only one that had me giggle. Her banter with Kieran Culkin and their love-hate relationship and jokes actually made me chortle once, and I'll admit that. (Their arguing, \"chicken-egg\" debate, the Golden Girls, etc.) The Batman and Robin sketch also had *some* potential elements of funniness, such as a joke about Superman's hair and comic book references, but it was wasted away. The timing is bad and the shots in the film feel like a first take, as if they didn't even try. All mentioned moments, also, add up to about 20 seconds total. That's 0.35% of the entire \"film\".\r Ultimately, the most depressing part of it all is that the cast is actually in this crap. They don't seem to be trying and it's documented by one of the directors/producers that no one actually wanted to be in this; it's evident due to the horrid delivery of \"funny\" lines. The entire cast is wasted and nowhere in the 94 minutes of trash did they ever take advantage of their incredible, funny and talented actors. This is the stupidest film of all time but I somehow giggled once. Is it a good movie? No. Never. Not at all in the slightest. In fact, it's the worst movie of all time. It has EVERYTHING wrong with Hollywood  and the world  in one atrocity. A-listers to cynically attract audiences (victims, really), a pile of trash that has absolutely no work put into it, no art whatsoever, a \"comedy\" with no laughs, and it somehow managed to make 94 minutes feel like four hours.\r After you cringe two or three times due to the humor (which is all driven by making people go \"ew\", nothing else), you really do get bored. It's so repetitive, and I can't believe that not a single sketch was good. This could have been really good, considering the talent involved, but once they decided to make it all obscene, they should have stopped. There's no way to win. You infuriate and insult 99.99% of the audience and once they become accustomed to the beyond lowbrow \"humor\" that it's going for, you become numbed to it and begin to cry inside. It's lose-lose-lose. It's expected for an anthology to not be 100% great, but the ratio of miss-to-hit here is simply astounding.\r Sitting through it made me a stronger person, and one of the worst parts of it was that it was so incredibly boring. This is the biggest disgrace to cinema ever, something that I love near and dear, something that is truly my passion. I used to like a ton of these actors, but I won't be able to forget their involvement in this catastrophe. At least Elizabeth Banks' sketch is halfway through the credits so most people won't see it. Also, they cut out the sketch where Anton Yelchin played a necrophiliac that would rape female bodies at the morgue at which he worked.\r If I were to ever commit suicide, r",

The marketing team must have had a hell of a time trying to sell \"Movie 43\" to the general public because it's a comedy that really isn't about anything. It's a series of skits strung together by a barely cohesive narrative. Of course, there have been many skit films before \"Movie 43,\" but this is the first film to be backed by a major studio and to have a litany of A-list actors, actresses, and filmmakers involved.\r The film is centers on an unkempt \"screenwriter\" (played by Dennis Quaid), who is trying to pitch his movie to a Hollywood executive (played by Greg Kinnear). Much like the rest of the movie, their situation begins to spiral into absurdity, and in between we are treated to a series of mock ads and strange scenarios that increasingly build on their gags until they just eventually sort of end.\r \"Movie 43\" fares best in its first half, as the film's opening half hour boasts a number of amusing shorts  including a bit of silliness featuring Naomi Watts and Liev Schreiber as parents who take the home-schooling concept to very dark places. However, the film begins to lose steam somewhere around the midway point, inundated with sketches that are completely pointless and desperately unfunny. The second half of the film is loaded with skits that are either disastrously overlong or problematic; quickly losing any appeal that might be left.\r If the sketches have any unifying style, it's that they go for shock value over genuine laughs most of the time. \"Movie 43\" is best suited for in the home-entertainment market, where these short story dilemmas can be hashed out between bong rips and consuming large amounts of alcohol.",

A 90 minute endless barrage of \"aristocrat jokes\" that play off as lame as the last. I wasn't offended, so much as I was insulted. Insulted to think that the Farelly brothers continue to \"push the envelope\" thinking their audience is said 16 year old kid who still laughs when people fart. There is a way to do low brow, and this isn't that way. \"Edgy\" is not created by doing something so off the wall and offensive, it's gotta be funny. Edgy is doing something different, so unique and \"thought provoking\", it's funny. If this movie was trying to be Patton Oswalt, it took a terrible left turn and ended up being a mix between Carrot Top and Dane Cook; telling a 90 minute long Aristocrat joke. *0 out of 5 stars*",

Even with my low hopes, my first textI had zero hopes for this movie before viewing, based on the editor\u2019s opening email to me, \u201cReview Movie 43  apparently one of the worst films of all time. Go on, I dare you.\u201d A dare is a dare of course! Even with my low hopes, my first text when I left the movie was \u201cWell mum, I think I should quit uni and go into script writing if Movie 43 can get made!\u201d.  Three people also walked out of the movie in the first 15 minutes. Movie 43 is a series of 13 short comedy skits framed around a washed up script-writer as he pitches his idea of a movie. Movie 43 is hated by nearly every film critic out there, rightly so, however if you are not easily offended, there are a few laughs. The opening scene of Davis (Hugh Jackman) and Beth (Kate Winslet) on a blind date is enough to satisfy anyone that they could be at a decent movie. When Davis removes his scarf though, to reveal testicles hanging from his chin, you do start to wonder where this movie is going! As it turns out, the movie is mostly downhill. As usual, Anna Faris and Emma Stone were very entertaining in their respective scenes, and an advertisement on how we shouldn\u2019t abuse our day to day machines because it hurts the little children working inside them was funny, but still did not set the bar very high for an ensemble comedy. If there were not so many Hollywood stars, it is doubtful if it Movie 43 would have got general release, but the cast do give it some hope. So long as you are not easily offended, and can enjoy a movie that has no direct point or storyline, then this movie does have a few outrageously disturbing moments you have to see to believe, including discovering what the iBABE is! It does not deserve to be a box office hit though, so illegally stream it or wait until the $1 DVD rentals are out.",
