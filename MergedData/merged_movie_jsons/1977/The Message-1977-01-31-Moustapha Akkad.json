            "content": "I am Orthodox Christian, but I must acknowledge this masterpiece. Allegedly, the movie is historically precise, and if it really is, then there's no essential difference between Christianity and Islam. Trouble does not lie in opposition of two religions, it lies in the existence of greedy, blood-thirsty politicians who incite religious fanaticism and abuse basically peaceful religions to accomplish their political and economic goals. Anyway, if you're not Muslim, you just have to put your prejudice aside (if you have any) and you'll enjoy this excellent piece of cinematography.10/10",

            "content": "Director Mustapha Akkad thought the Islam is misrepresented and there is a right way to present it. He thought the most effective way to present was a creating a movie.So he moved on to USA with just a Holy Quran to guide him.Besides the great movie he make, he make it with two different cast for a different language. That is one of the specialities of the project.The movie is teaching Islam with the best way to present it. The story is saying that Christianity and Islam is not that different, the movie just teaches the truth. Before Internet this was the best way to present the Islam with the right way. There was sadly more Islamafobi than today, there was misunderstanding to Islam. This movie can't fix all that but it was quite amazing project. All the box office earnings were donated by the way.This wasn't the only reason why he made this movie. He made an amazing movie that inspires so many people. The story of our Prophet Muhammed (S. A. V.) that we all should know. Not the whole life story of course but at least the major events.Cinematography is quite amazing, I wasn't aware of that because there was no wide-screen version of the movie until 4K Blu-Ray. The 4K makes the visual quality so much better. Also sound quality is improved but it could be better.The Academy Award nominated Original Scores by Maurice Jarre is just beyond perfect. I don't know how to describe it, It's so inspirational. Composer Maurice Jarre said \"I lived in the middle of the desert for three months to get inspiration.\" He's so brilliant composer, he made one of the most iconic Original Scores of all time.The Art Direction & Set Decoration is also perfect. Makes you feel that you're living that scene. Costume Design and Makeup is also quite good. These are brings more reality to a Historical movie.",

            "content": "This is a great film. I'm a history major who took several courses in the history of the Middle East and Islam, so nothing is going to be good or accurate or trivia filled enough for me, but it certainly didn't contradict anything I'd learned (for cinematic purposes or otherwise), and that's more than I can say for any historical epic I've seen in several years.This film starts with Muhammed receiving the Koran from the angel Gabriel and ends at his death. It was filmed in accordance with Islamic political correctness, so The Prophet himself is never depicted, visually or vocally. While this is well affected, it unfortunately removes him from a lot of the story. I would like to have known a lot more about his life from the film, not his mannerisms or speech as depicted by a particular actor, but at least the major events of his life, his children, his wives, and so on.Having said that, however, the film is still a very good depiction of the birth of Islam. The plot focuses on the historical events rather than the Koran itself, which contains almost no history from its own period, and is therefore different from a lot of Biblical epics which present the historical events IN the Bible. It's accurate in that it tries to present the birth of Islam as most people today probably learn it. Definitely not a propaganda piece, but it's not a movie filled with facts, truth or fiction, more a movie of character and tone. It's more similar to Braveheart than it is to Ben Hur or the Gospel of John. The movie presents a decent snapshot of the times and the attitudes and lifestyles under which Islam developed.The acting is fantastic, the music is good (won an academy award), and the cinematography, filmed in Morocco and Libya, is beautiful. Costumes are cool, and there's a few scenes with a set of ancient bagpipes for you Celtic history buffs.",

I'd be curious if  it is continued to be played in other parts of the world.  As I recall, it was difficult to follow, though Quinn is almost always entertaining to watch. It seemed a minor epic, though taking on a tough topic. \nThe sad part about this movie is that some Islamic extremists engaged in some terror attacks in protest of the film -- protesting that one should never show the likeness of Mohammed, Islam's tenets deeming it blasphemous. They never bothered to find out that the film didn't show him at all.",

Though the theme of this movie is the birth of Islam, I think it should have a variety of audience from many religions and cultures. I think the things that are emphasized, the struggle for the cause you believe, the sacrifices you have made for the beloved, are all universal values that have been emphasized with a rather outstanding casting and directing...I think everyone should watch this movie no matter what his/her religion, thought, culture is...

When I watch it today, it still does! I don't believe anyone can watch this film and not become moved or even shaken by what he/she sees and hears! If the movie has one shortcoming, it's that the main character, prophet Mohammed (peace be upon him), is never actually seen or heard, as it would have been a deadly sin to have an 'imposter' playing Him in the movie. Although this takes some getting used to and creates some lengths (i.e. dialogs which are rather more monologues with pauses), the rest of the movie compensates in full! Watching this movie will probably not make you go out to become a muslim (although I have read that most of the cast/crew involved did so), but certainly put some thought and understanding into you.

I can't imagine why that is, because films like \"The Ten Commandments\" and \"King of Kings\" seem to be universally known from the Christian perspective. I also have to confess that I know very little of the religion of Islam, though we are inundated on a daily basis with the extremist elements that have emerged from that ideology. I thought this picture presented a very even handed portrayal of the origins of Islam, even though a major downside was the inability to show the character of Mohammad on screen, a consideration afforded to the adherents of the religion. As a springboard to learning more about Islam, I think this film is an effective first step, designed to lead those having an interest toward other sources of information. The casting for the film is first rate, with excellent cinematography and bold characterizations. It deserves wider recognition among cinema fans, as evidenced by the relatively low number of user ratings and film reviews on this board.",

What really struck me was that when in the film religious (holy) verses (like psalms) were sung or played, the whole audience would reverently sing along. Very moving.Of course, it was 25 years ago, and I cannot remember a lot of it, but it was my first encounter with Islam and made a major impact.",

            "content": "The Message is a film about the rise of Islam on the Arabian Peninsula. It details the life of Muhammad, a citizen of Mecca, a popular trading city at the time, who started preaching about a new vision from God, eventually gaining such a following that he had to be driven out of town by those in power. But this only allowed him to spread his message even farther.It's a nice enough historical biopic slash religious film. Director Moustapha Akkad went to great lengths to make the film as accurate as possible while still staying true to the doctrine of Islam. His budget wasn't the greatest, meaning that for example the city of Mecca looks rather run down and minuscule, a small scattering of ruins more than anything, but such things can be forgiven.Two version of the film were made almost simultaneously. One for the Western audiences, with Western actors, and one for the Arabian audience, with an Arab cast. Interesting idea, and one that probably allowed the film to reach the West at all, but I quite honestly would have preferred if he had just stuck with Arab actors. Now the only copy I could find was the one with Western actors, and while they did their jobs admirably, it was still a bit odd to know that this probably wasn't the \"definitive\" version. Or at best, only half of it.The film has bigger problem than that, however. And that is the Islamic tradition forbidding images of Muhammad being depicted in any shape or form. Meaning that this film doesn't have Muhammad in it. Sure, he's there, in many of the scenes, but he's not shown, nor is his voice heard. At best we see the scene as through his eyes, with people talking directly at him, i.e. the camera.They also excluded many of the people closest to him. So the film doesn't have his wives, his daughters, his sons-in-law, nor a couple others of his close relatives. Take all those out and what's left is his uncle Hamza (Anthony Quinn in this version) and his adopted son Zayd (Damien Thomas) as the focus characters.And I'm sorry, but that's a really awkward way of telling the story. Now it seems like Muhammad is a mute and people around him are putting words in his mouth. Because his character is not allowed to speak. It's like he's a figurehead of this new religion, a puppet on strings. That obviously wasn't the intention nor is it what actually happened, but that's the impression coming through the screen.Plus it's at times pretty comical, which doesn't help.The Message is not a bad historical epic. It has passion, it is interesting and the visuals are about as good as they could make them. But its innate limitations make it more than aggravating to watch from a practical point of view.",

            "content": "Moustapha Akkad's movie \"The Message\" (alternately called \"Mohammad, Messenger of God\") tells the story of the founding of Islam. In compliance with Islamic tradition, Mohammed himself is not depicted, since the religion forbids depictions of him. So, the movie focuses mainly on Mohammed's uncle Hamza ibn 'Abd al-Muttalib (Anthony Quinn). Most of the movie is very energizing, despite a few slow scenes. Without a doubt, Mohammed (just like Jesus) was basically a revolutionary, showing how the people in control of Mecca were oppressing the majority of the population. And so, he founded a religion that is now the faith of about one fifth of the world population. One can argue that there was nothing bad about having multiple gods as Mecca did before Mohammed founded Islam, but Mohammed and his followers certainly believed in what they were doing, and the movie makes a very good point of that. Also starring Irene Papas, Michael Ansara (Barbara Eden's former husband), Johnny Sekka and Michael Forest.Akkad (who was best known as the producer of the \"Halloween\" franchise) later cast Quinn and Papas in \"Lion of the Desert\", about Libyan national hero Omar Mukhtar, who fought against the Italian occupation.

            "content": "\"Being Muslim myself who lived in the West I felt that it was my obligation, my duty, to tell the truth about Islam. It is a religion that has a 700-million following, yet it's so little known about it, which surprised me. I thought I should tell the story that will bring this bridge, this gap to the West.\" \u2013 Moustapha Akkad, director of \"The Message\"And for this visionary effort, I respectfully applaud the late Syrian director who made the inspiring drama and haunting epic celebrating the birth of Islam, a faith that has reached today the billion of followers. So little is yet known about it and what is known doesn't prevent it from certainly being the most misrepresented, misunderstood and openly disregarded of all the religions. Still, Akkad's initial intention didn't fail, nor had \"The Message\" lost its cultural significance. the noble purpose of the film was simply diluted in a mass of events and uncontrolled sociocultural representations that contributed to erode the image of Islam within the average Occidental eye. Ultimately, for one film trying to depict the positive values for which Islam stood, the scarf, suicide bombers, hijackers, the terrorist attacks of September 11th, the Great Djihad or the Prophet-drawing controversy contributed to a whole negative mythology damaging the image of Islam. Indeed, the Green Scare still prevails and it's even sadder that Akkad, himself, was killed, along with his daughter, in a terrorist attack in Jordan in 2005. But this tragic irony of fate should also give the benefit of doubt toward Islam when it's the most faithful and respectable followers that are killed by minorities pretending to be of their own. The first victims of terrorism in the Islamic world are Muslims indeed; sadly, the media are so prejudiced that they're most likely to associate Islam with a fatalistic image of violence and intolerance, while its Universalist message was specifically delivered to stand against the very injustices on which it is blamed by the detractors. The film opens in the Mecca of the sixth century, where people from different regions of the Arabic peninsula came to pagan pilgrimages. At that time, like the Merchants who were banished from the Temple by Jesus, some rich exploiters made a real business out of a religious obedience counting no less than 300 idols, all represented in statues and totem-like figures. Slavery naturally existed, so did such infamous 'traditions' as baby girls' burials. But the days of these barbarian practices were numbered and rumor had it that Muhammad met the Ange Gabriel and received a Revelation. Muhammad was an illiterate shepherd in his forties but the Miracle happened when he was capable to read the Divine Message. Islam's founding event was the miracle of Muhammad's reading, which says enough about the importance of knowledge as a virtue more valuable than any skills at fighting.Muhammad and the first ranks of martyrs standing behind him would become a threat to the Order. The film illustrates from the contrast between Meccan practices and Muslims, the true nature of Islam: tolerance, justice and total equality. One of the most symbolical and powerful moments come when Bilal, the Ethiopian slave, refuses to slaughter a man who was stating that everyone was equal in Islam, which earned him a worse punishment. Bilal would ultimately become the first muezzin of Islam's history, the voice that reassembles Muslims to the mosque for the prayers, and it's still a man's voice that continues to unite Muslims in all over the world. There is this constant idea of the world as a whole, of men and women as one people submitted to one God, as the first pillar of Islam is the testimony of faith, that there is no god but God (Allah) and Muhammad is his apostle.And speaking of Muhammad, I have to be honest, it's very difficult for me to review \"The Message\" as the film speaks for something deeply rooted in my soul: a vague notion some would describe as 'faith'. Faith is never blind in my opinion but it does possess blinding effects. At the end, it's impossible for me not to feel directly concerned by 'The Message\", as a Muslim, and I'm not blind because I don't want to see what could be seen as flaws but because I see what can be seen as flaws but I know that there are not, and that the film handles bravely and tactfully a very difficult subject. And naturally, the first element that would immediately divide opinions is the representation of the Prophet Muhammad.It's one of these strange ironies that one of the most influential and important personalities of Humanity's history is the least represented human figure. But that's the very basis of Islam, there's no Icon because \"The Message\" came specifically to fight the pagan obscurantism, nothing can be sacred, not even a human since there is no god but God, there's no God-like figure, even the Divinity of the Christ, the Trinity, is not recognized. The physical absence of the most preeminent character can confuse some viewers, but this is the way Islamic civilization acknowledged the holiness of Muhammad without materializing, that would have fatally made him an icon. This is why Muhammad is spoken about but never seen, but his aura is powerfully indicated by all the other performances, notably the late Anthony Quinn who plays Hamza, the prophet's uncle. Many other epics would be made about Islam, but \"The Message\" remains the milestone, the first to tackle the difficulty of representing the prophet and its resonance in the Islamic world is indubitable. Till now, Maurice Jarre's score, rightfully Oscar-nominated, is used in many religious programs and is widely associated with Islam, as if it was capable to translate into notes, this very aura Muslims tend to embrace without totally touching it. No one is perfect after all, only God is.",

That is the kind of dedication that was put into this project. From the start of the film, there is a note that Al-Azhar University approves the historical value of the movie. People took this job seriously and it shows in the final product.I expected the film to be in Arabic with English subtitles and was disappointed to see a large amount of exceedingly white \"Arabs\" in the main role. But that did not detract from the quality of the film or its message. The English speaking actors are not well known, but all give good performances.There is a certain Greek actress, Irene Papas, who plays the wife of one of the tribe leaders and she is something fierce. She has a beautiful wrathful gaze and with those acting skills and face her name should really be bigger in the West.I eventually briefly viewed the Arabic version of the film and it looks of equal quality. The acting is different but still good.Because the makers were not allowed to show Mohammed, the prophet, it gives the movie a unique angle but also a unique awkwardness. The first time the story introduced the presence of Mohammed, it was confusing. You stare at the screen and wonder what is going on until you realise that, oh OK, these people were just reacting to his presence.People speaking to Mohammed are often speaking to the cameraman, and thus to the viewer. Mohammed does not speak, even though people speak to him. So, it feels like you are the silent protagonist in an adventure game. You must agree, it is a bit odd to have a main character who does not appear in his own movie even once. I mean it is pretty cool that these guys think that I am Mohammed, but I would prefer not to get dragged into the birth of Islam if you do not mind.Please note that this film cannot avoid being a religion pusher, just like any Jesus film would be, but of course any viewer already knows this going in, and if you can make peace with that idea, what awaits you is a pretty epic movie, with clashes of character, faith and sword. It is a very coherent, well shot movie, rival to the best of Christian epics.",

Too bad, because this is a pretty interesting film on a subject not that well known in this part of the world. I am sure a lot of western viewers will be surprised by some facts the movie reveals to the audience. For example, it is taught that in Islam, women are equal to men, and that Muslims should have respect to Jews and Christians. Also, the telling of how Arabia was slowly but eventually converted to Islam is a pretty interesting story.The movie is well worth seeing, though it's not perfect. Some flaws are:(1) The character of Mohammad is distant to the audience. Now, I realize they couldn't show or reveal the character on screen in any way. And they try real hard to work around that. But in the end I didn't have that much grasp on this historical figure. Maybe I would have to read the Quran to find out more about him.(2) The battle scenes are not very well directed. Many shots show the hundreds of extras shuffling around, or not acting in a way as fierce as you might expect.(3) The length of the movie - three hours long. The movie does seem to need this length to properly tell the story, but it's kind of exhausting to sit through. I would recommend that if you watch the movie, you divide it in chunks and have a short break between chunks so you won't be worn out.But as I said, the movie is still worth watching.",

And although my interest in religion (never having understood why \"The Bible\" is considered real, and \"Lord of the Rings\" isn't), I couldn't allow myself to pass this curiosity of a historic epos.This might be an enjoyable romp for believers, who either know the story already or believe that the story happened as portrayed here, but all others might begin to wonder early on: \"Why am I watching a three-hour-plus movie with an imaginary protagonist?\" Anthony Quinn does his best to make his performance carry the scenes but there is something restraint in his performance and after a couple of hours of watching Quinn talk either straight to the camera or to what often seems an 'invisible friend', one cannot help but to feel slightly schizophrenic.If would have taken a director with guts, say Martin Scorsese (who would later refresh sanctimonious, one-dimensional bible films with his controversial \"The Last Temptation of Christ\"), to turn this tepid retelling into a real film. Perhaps in the future, a death-defying crew of producers and directors decide to make a remake of this film, allowing the protagonists to be portrayed, such as is the case in many other films, by an actor. My personal choice for Mohammed would be Daniel Day Lewis.If non-controversial, conformist films about the origin of a creed are your thing, I recommend \"The Bible\" or \"Little Buddha\" (which actually might have benefited from a policy that would have stopped Keanu Reeves from being seen or heard on screen). If you enjoy Anthony Quinn in his role as bearded, fez-wearing Arab, why not go for \"Lawrence of Arabia\" or even \"Omar Mukhtar \u2013 Lion of the Desert\" (like \"The Message\" co-produced by slain Libyan president Muhammar Ghadaffi).This movie I can only recommend to the quire to which it's already preaching, and perhaps people who enjoyed watching \"The Invisible Man\" but found the Chevy Chases voice-over annoying.I'll give it three points: one for the beautiful setting, one for the lovely musical score and, despite acting slightly more restraint than usually, one for Anthony Quinn.",

Furthermore, his main character could not be shown at all!Despite these requirements and limitations, Akkad ultimately made a fine movie. Epic in scale, lavish in production and engaging in plot. It clocks in at a touch under three hours but doesn't feel like it, it moves along so smoothly. Akkad gets around the inability to show Muhammad through some clever devices, often concentrating on his senior aides rather than the man himself, and when he does have to have him present, doing it from a first person perspective. Not as engaging as if we actually had the main character visible, but I can't think of a better way he could have made the film, given that restriction.As a person who does not know much about the history of Muhammad and Islam, quite edifying.Good cinematography and battle scenes.

As other reviewers will surely have noted by now, it tackles the prohibition of not being able to show the Prohet Muhammad by showing the film from his point of view.While this is one way to get around the problem, the actual result is mediocre at best. The acting in the movie is spotty at best - perhaps slightly better than your low-budget Christian production of the life of Jesus, but that's about it.

            "content": "This life story of prophet Mohammed is strictly halal - a retelling of the beginning of Islam true to the essence and devoid of popular misconceptions about the religion. This naturally caused a significant filming problem as depiction of Mohammed is haram (forbidden), so director Moustapha Akkad had to devise a way of shooting a movie about the prophet without ever showing him or even supplying him a voice. This actually initiated a popular uprise amongst Muslims, when the movie was first received, as they were fed by the wrongful assumption that Anthony Quinn is indeed portraying Islam's holiest man. In fact however the closest we ever come to seeing Mohammed is a shot of his famous blade Zulfiqar (in some traditions a gift from the Archangel Gabriel), his wooden staff or a first-perspective camera as we look through his eyes.The story itself is told by secondary figures (as depicting Mohammed's immediate family is also not allowed) like the prophet's uncle Hamza (Anthony Quinn) or adopted son Zaid (Damien Thomas). Other characters featured are the freed slave and first Muezzin Bilal (Johnny Sekka) as well as his first enemies: Hind (Irene Papas), Abu Sofyan (Michael Ansara). Apart from the origins of the religion, its similarity to Old Testament teachings of discarding false pagan idols, kinship to Christianity and Judaism (extremely well depicted when Muslim refugees seek audience with the Christian Emperor of Abyssinia), the movie also indulges into epic warfare with two key battles fought during the emergence of the Islam: the Battle of Badr and the Battle of Uhud (argually the weakest spot in the movie as lacking tension and poorly choreographed). There obviously is a significant problem with the main protagonist of the story hidden from sight and his messages relayed by third persons, as it causes lack of character identification and little involvement into events portrayed apart from a historical and educational standpoint.As pure contextualisation of Islam \"The Message\" stands the test of time, at times struggling within the confines of non-presenting the prophet and carrying a mixed bag of performances, but otherwise steadfastly placed within the facts and religion. Somewhat whitewashed, albeit not as much as some detractors would claim, it carries the strong humanist ideal behind Islam, focusing on points which ring self-evidently morally correct in modern time (mainly regarding slavery, equal rights or women emancipation). That does of course bring to the forefront questions whether Islam has been so misrepresented by religious scholars or subverted by tradition, that especially women's rights as nowhere near the place it is presented in the movie.A strong kinship exists between this movie and those epics dealing with the birth of Christianity, such as \"Quo Vadis\", \"Ben Hur\" or \"The Ten Commandments\". Not only regarding the subject, but a predominant Hollywood model of portraying such religious events. As such faith conversion is never deeply analysed, but treated as a given (obvious superiority of the new faith over idolatry). With such framing right and wrong is obviously divided between religious lines, although a certain grey area does exist and 'villians' are always offered a chance at redemption. Essentially glorified iconography not much can be derived from it as commentary, most heartfelt reactions are brought about by messages inherent to the given religion. Nonetheless an excellently shot movie gifted with a strong budget (apparently given by the late Muammar Gaddafi), nicely pulled in together by a gifted helmer.Proves that big-budget features can be made in Arab countries. I for one wish for some big financiers to throw together their diamond rings, Maybach's and gold-platted villas to fund a movie portraying the Arab point of view on the Crusades...",

It was a risky movie considering they didn't show the prophets face neither his voice yet the film was based on him, and yet they managed to make such a brilliant film. From what i heard this movie was banned and no longer shown due to its powerful influence on people and converting them to Islam, although i have no proof on this but it is what i heard.",

            "content": "I wanted to see this movie because I'm interested now in the history of Islam, altough I'm a Christian. And for me, a person who knows almost nothing about the religion, it is amazing how this film makes it easy to understand not only the history of how Islan began but the principles of religion as well. As an introduction to Islamism, to anyone who wants to understand it, it's great and for Christian people I believe they will see many, many parallels with our religion's history as well.Apart from that, the movie itself is really good. What amazed me most is that it is not boring and flows really well and fast, even though it is almost 3 hours long. The score is beautiful and Anthony Quinn's and Irene Papp\u00e1s' performances are both great. The battle scenes on the desert are really nice and great for us to understand how were tribes battles in those times, since the Bible narrates a lot of them too.However, there is one thing I didn't like very much in this film: the director's choice of representing Muhammad (he cannot be represented because Islamic religion forbids it), sometimes as if the camera was him and other times we only hear about him. It is a bit confusing in technical and narrative terms; he shoul've chosen a specific way to represent Muhammad and have stick to it.Apart from that the film is really worth it, as an entertainment and as a historical and didactic picture about early Islam.",

And from the lessons that i learned about the prophet, it conforms to what i have watched in the movie. In this aspect, i think all the film makers of any historical movies should have followed the footsteps of this kind of film maker in making a well thorough research before presenting their so-called historical features. This is very important because we know that in every historical event that has happened, it carries with it a generation of people who are touched and affected by it. And it is very important to tell the truth about it since the effects are so much felt by the one who are involved.In terms of the movie itself, in my own personal opinion, it is one of the best movie i have ever watched. It is unique in style since the main character is not even spoken any words or showing any physical gestures. It is indeed an epic of a holy man. The acting, no doubt about how great it is. The talented actors such as Anthony Quinn and Irene Papas really do their jobs well.

            "content": "As Muhammad's following grows even among old enemies, Bu-Sofyan says \"Muhammad, there is still doubt in my heart.\" \"If we were to cut off your head it would remove all your doubts,\" responds Khalid.\"Khalid,\" Bilal chastises, \"there's no compulsion in religion.\" Bilal, one of Muhammad's top lieutenants, must not have received Allah's memo. The Koran's verse on \"no compulsion in religion\" (2:256) was at this point already abrogated by the more recently revealed verse of the sword: \"Kill those who join other gods with God wherever ye shall find them\" (9:5). Like Khalid's threat, director Moustapha Akkad's religious epic, \"The Message,\" does depict the violent streak of Islam, but uses sugarcoated dialog throughout the film to allow for easier swallowing by Western audiences.Akkad must have grown up watching and loving Biblical epics, and wanted to bring the same Hollywood grandeur to the life of Muhammad. For example, Akkad portrays the early Muslims like the Christian martyrs of Nero's Rome in \"Quo Vadis.\" Like Palm Sunday scenes from \"Jesus of Nazareth\" or \"The Greatest Story Ever Told,\" Muhammad's arrival in Medina is marked by palm-waving locals (just swap out the donkey for a white camel). Anthony Quinn's Hamza character mimics John the Baptist, and Damien Thomas's Zaid is Muhammad's St. Peter. Irene Papas and Michael Ansara serve as the blood-thirsty Herod & Salome of Mecca. And Richard Johnson, the narrator from \"Moses the Lawgiver,\" serves as, you guessed it, narrator of \"The Message.\" However, gospel parallels end there. Muhammad's ministry ends--not with salvation on a cross--but with a massive armed attack against his political foes, including a beheading spree. This bloody twist is fitting for a religion borne out of combat and a film directed by the future producer of \"Halloween.\" (Another notable similarity: in \"Halloween\" we don't see the actual face of Michael Myers who, like Muhammad, is periodically played by the camera!) Sadly, Akkad whitewashes other uncomfortable aspects of Islam: Muhammad's followers in \"The Message\" proclaim repeatedly to astonished Arabs that women are equal to men, whereas the Koran itself actually ascribes to women lesser rights of inheritance (4:12), lesser innate worth (2:228) and permits wife-beating (4:38). Equally exaggerated is Islam's compatibility with Christianity: the movie's Christian king of Abyssinia tells Muhammad's representatives that the Muslim and Christian are separated by no more than a line on the ground. The scriptwriters thus sidestep the denial of Christ's divinity by Muhammad, the instructions of the Koran to \"take not Jews or Christians as friends\" (5:56), and that \"Jesus is no more than a servant\" (43:57).If you want a more honest assessment of the origins of Islam, try the documentary, \"Islam: What the West Needs to Know.\" For Anthony Quinn fans, check out \"Lust for Life.\" If you want a religious biopic, watch \"The Ten Commandments.\" For a great desert epic, see \"Lawrence of Arabia.\" But leave this snow-job on the shelf.",

Viewers expecting to see Mohammed in this three-hour epic will be disapappointed , as he never appears on the screen. As the scholars and historians of Islam-The University of Al-Azhar in Cairo , The High Islamic Congress of the Shiat in Lebanon have approved the accuracy and fidelity of this film . The makers of this film honour the Islamic tradition which holds that the impersonation of the prophet offends against the spirituality of his message , therefore , the person of Mohammad will not be shown . Instead , we see Anthony Quinn as Mohammad's uncle , as a honored warrior struggling to win religious freedom for Islam. Dealing with the birth of the Islamic faith, when Mohammed is visited by Angel Gabriel who urges him to lead a new religion, starting Mohammad preaching's of the Islam. Later on, leading the people of Mecca to a rebellion against corrupt politician s, powerful military forces and politheists who have around 300 idols at the Kaaba, instead worshipping the only God. After that, his getaway along with his followers from Mecca to Medina in 622 called Hegira , adding fights , sufferings , killings , tortures , religious persecution , battles and final victory in the Mecca to the death of the prophet in 632 . In four decades only Four : The Robe, The Ten Commandments, Ben Hur and now for the first time.. The vast, spectacular drama that changed the world !. An exciting story in 4-track stereo !. The story of Islam!.This is a spectacular epic that tends to drag a bit and it is definitively overlong . The shooting itself created a religious controversy . Equally , some inconsistent rumors emerged if Mohammed would not only be depicted in the film, but that he was to be performed by Hollywood screen heroes as Charlton Heston or Peter O'Toole resulting in protests by some Muslim , until director Moustapha Akkad hired a staff of respected Islamic clerics frpm Libanon and Egypt . Main and support cast are acceptable . As Anthony Quinn is terrific as Hanza, giving an excellent portrait , as well as a series of known actors , as American as British , such as : Michael Ansara , Michael Forest , Johnny Sekka , Andre Morell , Irene Papas , Martin Benson, Robert Brown, Rosalie Crutchley, Damien Thomas, Richard Johnson as narrator, among others . This Message was shot in two versions : one in Arabic and one in English language. Here stands out the evocative and brilliant cinematography by Jack Hildyard, shot in Morocco and Libya, in fact due to financing problems, Gadafi himself ended producing the film. Adding the moving and exciting musical score by Maurice Jarre, it's one of the main elements on the flick that enhances the highlights of the movie, especially in the battle scenes. The motion picture was professionally directed by Moustapha Akkad , though being overlong and has some flaws.",

            "content": "movie is just fantastic. The director of the movie has made three movies in his life time all on the same topic. Quite a difficult task, to make a movie on Muhammad and not show him. Its weird that not even Abu-Bakr and Ali are shown. I didn't know that Muslims were sentimental about the following two leaders also. I wonder why did they show Hamza and rest of the people aren't they holy enough? what a man Muhammad would have been. I think this was the best movie i saw on Muhammad which came really close to reality. No point of views just incidents. Muhammad is more important than even Alexander. It seems after Muslims united under Muhammad the first war they lost was after more than 100 years. Christ was accepted by king Constantin only around the downfall of roman empire which is around 378 AD. Weird.We don't realize that Christianity became famous after Christ was dead for more than 350 years. Islam is different as Muhammad became the king before he died and actually ruled for 2 years. A successful revolutionist. Its strange that political revolutions are closely linked with religion like Martin Luther, moses, Christ, conscious, even Gandhi was a practicing Hindu and so people called him mahatma before they accepted his political ideas. Stalin and Mao are probably two successful revolutionaries who did not talk about religion but then of course times were quite different in 6th-7th century. I liked that the movie took care of fact that Muslims do believe that god also talked to Christ before he talked to Muhammad. Thats one thing that Christians don't like at all. Muslim believe in it because Muhammad said so otherwise Muslims are quite discreet about such details also. I liked inclusion of the female child burial and slavery as an important issue for Muhammad to be accepted by common men. This movie has helped me understand the time in a better way. small details like Mecca citizens worshiped around 360 gods then, which is an important detail if care. I'v read about Muhammad's army but now i can relate to that army with Hamza and slaves in my mind. conflict between parents and youths was interesting. Desert scenes were breathtaking. Director did every thing as historically correct as possible. Even the sermons which Muhammad got from spirits were only talk of the town and not done in mythological way like thundering announcements from the sky(thank god).war scenes were pretty cool. I wish there was a movie in which Muhammad was shown as a character but that way Muslims are even behind Christians. you can film Jesus but not Muhammad. It seems three departments gave their approval before the film got released. One from Lebannon. after 50 years of civil war can't on their own feet will tell rest of the world how to make films that too historical. good film 8/10.",

The \"new\" religion gave though the liberty for one to fight with weapon for his (religion's) values and maintain it viral thus. Otherwise it'd die quickly and without glory. It is tempting to know that you're allowed to kill in the name of... virtues.3. The \"new\" religion made a promise to the men that they will ever be a supreme race. No matter if they are rich or poor, crippled or in great health... Always above the other half of the humanity. This unites at least 1/2 of the population of an area.4. Education - Mohamed proclaimed it and made it an affordable dream, which obviously the creators of the movie assume as a reality. Although everybody knows that religion/authority blossoms on ignorant masses' back. (and they are too ignorant to see it :))Where were left the following promises:equality between men and women; - non violence; - equality between nations and religions?In the movie somehow too quickly total opponents were turned into followers.I believe that masses can be rushed into everything, but this movie says that it can and had been done beautifully and nobly :)Finally, the movie turns out to be a simple, tender, precise propaganda.

This is a seventies epic in the same style of Zefirelli's \"Jesus of Nazareth\" and \"The lion of the desert\". All three movies feature a magnificent Anthony Quinn. The movie is very enjoyable and well made. Beautiful shots, great cinematography, good score, great acting. Of course it brings a very short version of the story of Islam, mainly chronicling the most important political and military events but leaving out loads and loads of elements. At 3 hours one cannot expect more. This is why I would have preferred a miniseries double that length, as in \"Jesus of Nazareth\". That gives time to settle in, to give much more information, teachings, etc. Of course the movie is not as it could have. Islamic creed prohibits the depiction of the Prophet: you never see Muhammad nor do you hear an actor as his voice. That's quite a handicap for the movie. The same goes for the most important people around him. Next to none are depicted in the film: Fatimah, Aisha and in general the whole family of the Prophet, Ali, Abu Bakr, and the other first four caliphs etc. The result of the above is a movie which brings the most important \"earthly\" sides to the advent of Islam, but lacks a bit in spiritual depth. It also brings the story of Islam without including all its most important pioneers. Though I respect this, I find it a great pity. Nonetheless, even with these limits the movie still deserves 7/10 if alone for the beautiful photography, the acting of Anthony Quinn and the beautiful depictions of Islamic holy sites at the very end.",

            "review_title": "the message",
            "content": "A movie \"The message\" describes generally early history of Islam religion. Specifically, it begins with the Prophet Mohammed when he was forty years and the God sends him Gabriel angel with the first saying \"Read\". Soon there starts revelation of Quran sayings of the God to the Prophet and to Muslim people. This revelation will last for twenty three years until the death of the Prophet. However, this movie does not focus much attention to Quran or to the lifestyle of the Prophet but rather mostly focused on the enemies of the Islam and sufferings of muslim people by them in the beginning when they became muslims. Although the movie was limited in time for around 3 hours, but it was enough to show the main events in Islamic history. Also in this movie the Prophet was not shown physically and not communicating which could arise some misunderstanding but replacing his speech by other surrounding people. Other factors also influenced for the clearness of movie to the audience.\nThe story of Islam is very long and could not be described in only three hours. To make it more clear the movie could describe the time when the Prophet was born, his life before he became the Prophet and other historic moments which are significant. However, there are so many things to be explained that the duration of movie could last to many hours. Therefore, I think this movie can be counted as an short introduction to early history of Islam religion because it covered the main history. The main events which described in this movie were the first reactions of local people to the religion of Mohammed. They could not imagine how the God could give the role of the Prophet to modest person in their community. However, they knew that Muhammad did not lie throughout his life and will not do that but they could not deny the religion of ancestors. They believed to many gods which they made themselves by stones or wood and believed that spirits of gods will come inside. Also it has shown how not only the Prophet suffered but other people too when they became muslims. Therefore, they forced to leave their Mecca to Medina where they will live in peace. However, after long time they return to their hometown by winning the war between muslims and other people. Finally, it ends with the last speech of the Prophet to his followers.\nAnother point is that the movie does not show the main character the Prophet Mohammed and Ali, who was his cousin and the husband of his daughter Fatima and Abu Bakr who was his best friend and other significant people to the Prophet. There is no such prohibition for showing character of Prophet by other people. And there are other movies where he is shown or at least his voice could be heard. However, I think the movie may consider the Muslim people by not showing the Prophet and not comparing to ordinary people. And it also prevents from the wrong picture of the Prophet in human minds. Therefore, this movie shows fully respect to Muslim people and increase its audience.\nHowever by not depicting the Prophet and other characters the movie could lose meaning because of missing leading characters. But movie tried to replace them by other characters help. However, the word of Prophet was indirectly told by others rather than him which made difficulties to watchers to distinguish between words of the Prophet and sahabas who lived at the times of the Prophet.\nAdditional factors also influenced to interest audience and gave more clear image of followers of the Prophet in that time. It is shown clear difference between followers of the Prophet and people who were against him physically. For example, muslims clothes were white which differentiated them from other group. Also the bright makeup of non muslims emphasized them. Not only physically but also by this movie it can be seen the attitude of muslims to others. They were mainly described as merciful to others even to their enemies after the war. Also how they communicated with the king of other countries also differed from other believers and nonbelievers because they only worshipped one God.\nTo sum up, this movie clearly and best describes the early history of Islam.The main events were taken into consideration. The effects of movie music and other factors were logically added to make enjoyable from rather that biography film. However, to increase knowledge about the history of Islam or other associated things one might consider to make movie with long duration and clearly describe the words of the Prophet by subtitles or to other methods to make clear for audience. Generally the movie is very good organized and structured and also the genre is very interesting.",

            "review_title": "The birth of Islamic Faith",
            "content": "The movie \"The Message\" directed by Moustapha Akkad which reveals how Islamic faith was born through the depiction of Muhammad Prophet's life story. At the beginning of the movie, it can be observed that Mecca worshiped several Gods and through these actions, Mecca was visited by many people from all over the world. That show this city survive and got their status. In the movie, Muhammad was about forty years and other citizens' attitudes towards him were not pleased. He spends his time in the Mount Hira by mediating in the cave. Thus this event was one of the important events in the movie as while he was mediating Angel Gabriel visited him and asked him to read. However, Muhammad told that he can not read and answered like that several times. After he returned to the home he was afraid of his answer but his relatives assumed that he was chosen as the God's Messenger. The most important further events started to happen after this scene in the movie.\nThe second very important event was the scene with the Bilal one of the slave who was converted to Islam and started to be one of the followers of Islam and Muhammad Prophet. In the movie the scene where masters tortured the slave, Bilal was accurately shown and revealed as the cruelest scenes in this movie. It represented that many people who declared that they become the followers of Islam were tortured. The reason caused the people to converted into Islam was the idea that everyone is equal in God's eyes. The main example was Bilal who was the slave before, and who became equal among his other Muslim brothers. In Mecca, people did not know what is religion and what is social equality. They worshipped many Gods that was accurately depicted in the beginning. Moreover, it is demonstrated how many positive sides Islam will bring to people. For example, when a young boy came to his parents and told them that he accepts Islam. even though his parents were shocked he explained to them that in Islam everyone is equal and he told the facts that newborn female babies were not buried alive as it was done before. That fact surprised his mother and she believed his son. Nevertheless, this scene considered as the positive change of newborn religion and show that for females this will always bring the better chance for a good life. In the Islamic religion, we may observe that men are superior over women. Women in the Islamic religion have more strict rules rather than men. That is why this statement causes a little kind of controversy.\nThere are two scenes of battles known as the Battles of Uhud and Badr which showed that the way of Islamic faith was not easy and came with the war too. Even though I did not think that these two battles were negative, there are other light sides that were shown in the movie. The most excellent scenes from my point of view were the scenes praying. The scenes were Bilal call people for praying was one of the most outstanding. In addition, how people prepare their bodies before praying also was very impressionable. It shows the main Islamic rules, the purity of the body and the mind. The depiction of how this practice was born represented in this move very precisely and left a very good impression.\nIn the movie, Muhammad Prophet was not depicted as it contradicts the Muslim rules. That is why we did not observe him in the movie. The way that production depicts him without personalizing himself was really good. For example, to show the presence of Muhammad in the scene it was known by the soft music which is a very good method. The presence of Muhammad in the scene also represented by the other people as Hamza or Bilal, and his words also were delivered through these people or other followers. The next good features that can be observed in the movies was the costumes that were worn by the people. For example, in Mecca, it is easy to differentiate who is rich and who is poor. However, when they depicted Muslims, all of them wear white long clothes and we cannot see the difference among them. Moreover, this scene demonstrates that in Islam there no social division, all people are equal and all of them are slaves of God.To sum up, this movie tells the story of the birth of Islam and the story of the Messenger on God Muhammad Prophet. The main events in this movie clearly explain how Islam was born and how people started to convert into this religion. One of the main characteristics was the reason for conversion. It was the positive changes that Islam was brought to this world. The scenes in this movie were very accurate and the most influential was the sound that shows the presence of Mohammad. The fact that Muhammad Prophet was not personalized is one of the specific features of this movie that makes it special to the viewers.",

            "content": "The 1977 years film \"The Message\" by Mustapha Akkad is about the prophet Muhammad. Its plot starts with the so-called message of the god - which insists on converging to Islam for salvation. This message is shared for different emperors of the Empires such as Heracles (the emperor of Byzantium), Patriarch of Alexandria, etc. In Mecca people never have seen the prophet Muhammad, but his relatives encounter him several times. People believe that he is in the mountain since he can see well what is happening in the city from there. Most of the elders were afraid of the Muhammad thinking that he is \"spreading dangerous ideas\". Most of the elders believed in the gods of Kaaba that are from clay.\nThere were massive rebellions from the followers of Muhammad and people started to believe the light ideas of Muhammad more and more. The dictator rich people punished Muhammad's followers, saying that in Kaaba there are more than 300 gods. The followers of the messenger Muhammad insisted that there is only one God. As time passed, the only protector - uncle of Muhammad died, and the prophet becomes without protection. However, Islam started to be spread out as followers safely moved from Mecca to other places. The dictators of Mecca started to track Muhammad to kill him.\nThe first mosque of Islam, the house of prayers was built in Medina. Equal rights of women, Jews and Christians, slaves, and rich were declared by the spread of Islam. There was a fight between the followers of Islam and the people who have stolen the properties of the followers. The followers of Muhammad won the fight. In another fight, Hamza was killed by the Mecca people. The followers of Muhammad reached all the Empires and started to persuade them to converge. The enemies that fought against Islam started to say sorry and follow the prophet, Muhammad. Mecca was taken by the followers of Muhammad, and the prophet announced Mecca as a holy city. All the gods were destroyed and there was only one God. As time passed, the whole of Arabia converted into Islam, all the beliefs, lifestyle, ideas, five-time praying were accepted. All Muslims were equal and had a common book - Koran. On June 8th 632 the Muhammad died, but the only God never died and was always alive.\nAs for the mood of the movie, it is serious and inspiring, showing the true birth of Islam in the steppes of the desert. There are various soundtracks, which are all instrumental. It is worth mentioning that Muhammad itself was not depicted in the film, which makes the documentary mysterious. It shows that the appearance of Muhammad is not obvious and he was a sacred prophet who existed throughout the film. The episodes are full of aggressive scenes of penalty, war, blood, and death. It shows that establishing Islam was not a piece of cake. It needs many times, victims, and unacceptance from other parties of Arabia. The length of the film is quite long, approximating three hours. The film is full of detailed scenes with little conversations. This assists the watcher to be fully engaged with the setting. There were different characters: The Prophet, Hamza, leaders of the states, followers, and nations. Different costumes reveal ancient times, especially the white dresses of the followers show the symbolic meaning.\nThe film covers many historical events such as the establishment of the first sacred mosque and the Muslim's song for praying. Despite the oldness of the film (1977) it is well cinematographed with many special effects and episodes. Due to its length and historical importance, it makes the watcher feel sad and cheerful. It brings ambivalent feelings to the watcher due to its complexity. But in the end, there is a spirit of victory of Islam over the dictator lands and the sense of equality against the \"deadwood\" social order. The story was mainly taught from the third person - the narrator. However, he spoke mostly in the beginning and at the end of the documentary. Most of the time there were short, but meaningful dialogues. There is a bit inconsistent and not obvious tone because the followers of Islam win and lose the fight, and the end won. The film sharply reveals the social order thousands of years ago, where black people were slaves. There is a struggle for power and appeal to the Christians. So, the film was not only concentrated on Islam, but it also gave knowledge about the other prophets like Moses, Jesus, and the prophets of other religions.\nThis film is a must-watch masterpiece. Despite its length, it catches the attention of the watcher of film and brings true insights about the birth of Islam. It shows the ideas, manners, and motives behind spreading Islam.",

            "review_title": "Faith and Film on IMDb",
            "content": "As a critic, The Message poses a challenge. The story of Muhammad is the crux of the Muslim faith. The Message naturally demands a more serious approach than your biweekly romcom. This film necessitated a pause so I could reflect on the purpose of criticism. I admit, I almost submitted this review with a higher rating in an act of pandering. That would have been a popular move, but disingenuous. After all this more than a hobby, it is my immortal soul at stake. So for those already infuriated, please bear with me.Originally, I watched The Message to answer one question: Why is this movie in the IMDb Top 250? I had never heard of this movie before, and I would likely not have ever seen it if it had not cracked this questionably prestigious list. Some IMDb users have grown increasingly frustrated by movies not in classical canon receiving such an honor. These non-USA made, low vote count films, often receive strong vitriol in user reviews and message boards. My best summary of this contempt is these films lack objective quality, rather, they appeal strongly to a subset of the community and do not deserve a general recommendation. I think the voter statistics suggest that not only is The Message an example of this phenomenon, it is the prime example. Bollywood movies were previously the go to offenders. These films garnered on average approximately 40% 10/10 votes. Superhero movies, consistently overrated and raised by a large sub-community, garner a similar percentage considering their slightly elevated position. Shawshank Redemption currently reigns supreme, and only convinces 53% of the populous it is perfect. 60% of users rated The Message 10/10. Compare this anomaly to Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, which currently ranks one spot bellow The Message, has only 18%. Admittedly, IMDb uses black magic to come up with the top 250. Even so, The Message dominates true rivals like films in the Top 30 which only score 10/10 percentages around 30%. Excuse the excessive use of numbers. I want some outside verification when I say The Message speaks very strongly to some and less so to others. This is not a suggestion that the people who voted 10/10 are wrong or should be discredited.Unfortunately, I believe this opinion gap is primarily based on source material. This marginalizes the debate over more subjective intricacies. As a non-Muslim, this film failed to engage me spiritually. I can appreciate the perspective and education the film provides, but it obviously did not affirm my faith. Beyond that, the quality of filmmaking leaves me hard pressed to suggest The Message over other epics. The subject works effectively as a narrative. Acting and cinematography were solid, similar to Hollywood flicks of decades past. The most differentiating characteristics were how The Message dodged sacrilege. As entertainment, The Message is simply too long. There were many scenes that seemed unwarranted which makes one feel every minute of the three hour run time. I am sure there is a scholarly reason for every line, but, as an outsider, I am taxed. The challenge of not depicting the central character is also met inconsistently. In some scenes, the presence of Muhammad is tangible, his direct manifestation is not necessary. These moments do not feel like a director struggling with an inconvenience, rather mastering this obstruction for effect. Sadly, just as many scenes are clumsy. I simply cannot believe The Message is engaging enough independent of religious context to support such a devoted following.Despite my lukewarm critical response, I am overjoyed that this film exists. The Message provides a perspective that is consistently marginalized in contemporary society. And if this outlook is delivered in the form of an entertaining epic, who am I to complain? More importantly, I am glad others have enjoyed such a strong reaction to this film. Many have shared their own personal account of watching The Message. It seems clear that a movie is providing a spiritual experience for thousands. No, I did not personally share these feelings, but I can relate. For me, it was Andri Rubilev. Simply as a lover of film, I am happy knowing people I have never met are experiencing a film in a way they might not have ever thought possible. The Message is an achievement because it is rare movie that demonstrates film's overwhelming potential.",

The sequence of the Prophet talking to the people and showing the face of the Muslim people is one of the best and most beautiful sequences in the history of cinema. The only problem with the film is that the Prophet did not speak, which was a crime at the time, and that is why the Prophet does not speak or his face is shown in the film. But in the continuation of the film, Muhammad Rasoolullah Majid Majidi, the Prophet, speaks as a child and his voice is played in the film.

            "content": "If anyone has a claim to the epic laurels of David Lean, it is Mustafa Akkad. Between his epics \"The Message\", \"The Lion in the Desert\" and the sadly unproduced \u1e62al\u0101\u1e25 ad-D\u012bn biopic, this filmmaker did for Islam and Libyan freedom fighter Omar Mukthar what Lean did for T.E. Lawrence: bring them to the global audience in a lush, compelling and vibrant way unequaled since.Both his finished epics star Anthony Quinn, a veritable fountain of charisma, in many ways revisiting his Auda Abu Taid role from Lawrence of Arabia with added maturity and nobility. The tech credits are astounding, particularly for a non-Hollywood film of this period. And the film's main appeal to a Western audience will likely be the exploration of the tyranny of confusion of early Christianity (doing to the first Muslims what the Romans did to the first Christians) and the evolution of this new religion.While \"The Message\" is laudable in its handling of a precarious balancing act: telling the story of a hero it can not show, for religious reasons, this works to the film's detriment. While you can squirm at the depiction of Jesus Christ in various films about that particular prophet, at least it gives you something to hold on to as an audience. Akkad's film's delicate reverence still proves too much, and while only hearing of the Prophet creates a powerful sense of mystery in the first act, it slowly wears on you. Religious dogma or no, we want to see him, and we never do.This is where \"The Message\" loses the epic duel with \"Lawrence\": the sweep is there, the visuals are lush, and Maurice Jarre's score is adequately stirring, but the human element is missing.And for all that, any film where Anthony Quinn charges through sand with a sword deserves to be treasured.",

            "review_title": "Well shown main characteristics of Islam",
            "content": "Moustapha Akkad starts his movie 'The Message' (1977) with the statement that the scholars and historians of Islam have approved the accuracy and fidelity of the movie. I agree that the depiction of Islam religion is well done here since it provides historical background of early Islam through the life of prophet Muhammad. The way the director portrayed the prophet, included stories of the followers and showed the obstacles Islam religion met on its way of becoming one of the largest ones actually outlines main characteristics and beliefs of Muslim community.\nFirst and the most distinctive feature of this movie is that there is literally no prophet Muhammad. However, even without the actor playing the role of the prophet, viewers can clearly feel the presence and the value of the prophet in this story. This is due to the strict restriction to to depict the prophet both visually and vocally. Nevertheless, the director could represent prophet Muhammad through soft background music during his scenes, and through other characters delivering his words. For me, it seems like the emphasis was put not on the prophet' life but on the message, he was delivering, the message of God.\nThe director skillfully integrated the stories of the followers of the prophet into the storyline in order to demonstrate the main characteristics of the Muslims. One and the main of them is equality of all. In those times, there were clear distinctions between masters and slaves. Bilal, who has been a slave for a long time, converted to Islam as soon as he has heard that 'Before God, all men are as equal as teeth of a comb'. This way Islam could call on discriminated minorities under its protective roof. Another thing is equality between men and women. One of the messages the Prophet delivered is that the burial of newborn girls should be stopped. Such kind of practice was common in that community as it was told by the mother of one of the Muhammad's followers. This represents not only equality, but also mercifulness in Islam religion. The scenes where Muhammad's followers had negotiations with the king of Abyssinia, showed how Islam is respectful to other Abrahamic religions. This respectfulness is directed not only to other religions, but also to parents and all other people. Finally, I would like to emphasize one more characteristic of Islam that grabbed my attention. It is the loyalty of the followers to one God, the only God. Monotheism, as it is known, is the main feature of the Islam religion. The loyalty and belief of the followers could be seen from the scene where the slave was being tortured, he kept repeating the phrase \"There is only one God'. This strong scene depicts the deep faith in the God that is higher and bigger than the physical pain.\nThe main characteristics of Islam religion created obstacles for Muhammad in spreading the religion in Mecca. The community in this city was divided into masters and slaves, that can be clearly seen in the movie through the clothes that people wear. The idea of equality attracted the slaves to become the followers of Islam and betray their masters. Of course, this is not a pleasant outcome for the rich, who tried to stop Muhammad by all means. Monotheism, also, faced a great opposition of the community of that region. At that time, worship of hundreds of Gods was practiced by the people in Mecca. Thus, it was a trading city that flourished due to many idol worshippers, who came to Kaaba. Bureaucrats were making profit from all these caravans. Therefore, it is not surprising that the idea of monotheism is risky for their economic trade. These kinds of contradictions between Meccan society and the Islamic beliefs made Muhammad's path of spreading the religion harder. However, these situations, that are depicted in the movie, shows what characteristics should a person carry in order to become a true Muslim.\nTo sum up, the director of the movie 'The Message', Moustapha Akkad was able to integrate the life story of the prophet Muhammad in demonstrating the main characteristics and beliefs in Islam religion. In the Quran it is written: 'Oh you who believe: obey God, obey the Prophet, and those who hold authority amongst you' (4:59). From this I can understand that the prophet Muhammad is the second main figure in Islam, thus the depiction of him visually and verbally is prohibited in the same way as the depiction of God. This Muslim rule was greatly followed by the director, that shows not only artistic purpose of the movie, but also willingness to introduce Islam to the world, to its viewers in a right way. Issues of equality, respect and loyalty in Islam were shown through the stories of the followers as the reason of their conversion, which emphasized the importance of the Muslim beliefs for the humankind. The movie shows not only the emergence of the Islam, but also its values and provides basic knowledge on the religion, which I would recommend to watch.",

            "content": "Moustapha Akkad in his film message tells a story of the early Muslim community in the age it emerged and started gaining popularity on the Arabian peninsula. Play of actors, soundtrack, script, and costumes, all of them deserve recognition and positive reviews. But the most important part of this film is its social, political, and religious implications that compose a symphony with the narrative of the film. This film examines Islam and the Muslim community on a deeper level than it may appear at first glance. It demonstrates the progressive character of Islam as a new religious institution, shows the Islam relationships with different religions (Christians, Zoroastrian).\nFirstly, the film \"Message\" demonstrates a positive shift in the life of society Islam as a religion and institution carried. In the age of Jahiliyyah, Arab society lacked centralized government, law, relationships were just regulated by tribal chief councils (shuras), and weaker were victimized (\"Religion and Society in Pre-Islamic Arabia\"). There was no order and wild customs were abundant. One such custom is burying female children alive. In one of the scenes of the film, there is a demonstration of reception of the revelation sent to prophet Mukhammad and an intensive discussion of this revelation by followers of prophet Mukhammad. This shows the significance of this issue and Islam's attitude towards it, which was very negative and prohibiting. The new verse of the Quran prohibited and outlawed such a horrific practice. This was a reflection of the progressivity of Islam as a religion. Another scene that demonstrated progressivity of the Islam is a scene of redemption of a slave who refused to whip one of the prophet Mukhammad's envoys. Slaves were one of the most vulnerable groups of a society subjected to abuses from their owners and other different hardships of life. Such attention and care he received from the follower of prophet Mukhammad may be unusual, but not for the Muslims. They appreciated his sacrifice and worshipping one monotheistic God. Such mercy and attention towards a slave demonstrate a progressive and egalitarian perspective of early Muslims and the progressive character of Islam. All of these cases showing the progressive character of Islam contradict with perspectives of some European thinkers of the colonial age. As far as Ernest Renan is concerned, Islam is irrational religion incompatible with progress and science (\"Colonialism and Transformation of Muslim Societies\"). This is a perspective of the colonial age European representative, which reflects disrespect and a sense of dominance over Islam. As we can see, examples of slave redemption of the prohibition of female child murder disapprove this perspective Eurocentric and colonialist thinkers, who although had significant authority in his society.\nSecondly, this film demonstrates the relationships of Islam with different religions. We can find evidence of the character of relationships with Christians, Zoroastrians. Christians are demonstrated in an ambiguous way, which reflects the complexity of relationships between two Abrahamic religions, Islam and Christianity. In one of the first scenes, where the Muslim envoy reaches the emperor of the Byzantine Empire, we see surprised and to some extent shocked Byzantine court members. They do not understand why the prophet Mukhammad is a messenger of God. This scene demonstrates the controversial character of relationships, which included mutual acceptance and theological controversies. Unlike other non-Muslims, Christians are categorized as Ahl al-Kitab (Jews and Sabians also belong to this category), which should be protected and protection tax (\"The Spread of Islam\"). So, there are positive and negative tones in their relationships because they received the revelation but still are not Muslims. The negative side is presented by religious controversies, which can be found in primary sources. For example, Al-Hajari (diplomat) argued with Christians that Muslims know God better because they do not worship images (unlike Christians), which is prohibited in Psalter (Ahmad ibn Qasim Al-Hajari, \"The Supporter of Religion Against Infidels\", p. 142). The positive side of their relationships can be found in the scene of the film where the Abyssinian king (Christian) allows persecuted Muslims to settle in his lands and says while creating a line on the ground: \"the difference between us and you is no thicker than this line\". This was said after a religious argument between him and Muslims. So, relationships between Muslims and Christians are controversial and include some degree of mutual acceptance as well as a disagreement in theological questions. The scene with the Persian emperor demonstrates that relationships between Islam and Zoroastrianism were more simple and unfriendly. In this scene, the Persian emperor tears apart the message brought up by the Muslim envoy. Zoroastrians, unlike Christians, belong to another category of non-Muslims, mushrikkin. This category of non-Muslims should be fought with (\"The Spread of Islam\"). We see no ambiguity in relation to the Zoroastrian emperor in particular and Zoroastrianism in general. The relationships between Muslims and Zoroastrians are very unfriendly.\nTo conclude, the film \"Message\" carries a lot of complex implicit concepts. First of all, this film demonstrates the progressive character of the Islamic religion by demonstrating its virtues, like the prohibition of the burial of female children alive and altruistic relation to slaves, thus challenging those who considered Islam as incompatible with progress. Another important concept is the relationships of Islam with Christianity (controversial) and Zoroastrianism (very unfriendly) as representatives of Ahl al-Kitab and mushrikkin respectively. The creators of this successfully integrate these concepts with the narrative about the life of the early Muslim community. In such a way, this masterpiece can be interesting for both regular viewers and people interested in the history of Islam.",

            "content": "Moustapha Akkad in his film message tells a story of the early Muslim community in the age it emerged and started gaining popularity on the Arabian peninsula. Play of actors, soundtrack, script, and costumes, all of them deserve recognition and positive reviews. But the most important part of this film is its social, political, and religious implications that compose a symphony with the narrative of the film. This film examines Islam and the Muslim community on a deeper level than it may appear at first glance. It demonstrates the progressive character of Islam as a new religious institution, shows the Islam relationships with different religions (Christians, Zoroastrian).\nFirstly, the film \"Message\" demonstrates a positive shift in the life of society Islam as a religion and institution carried. In the age of Jahiliyyah, Arab society lacked centralized government, law, relationships were just regulated by tribal chief councils (shuras), and weaker were victimized (\"Religion and Society in Pre-Islamic Arabia\"). There was no order and wild customs were abundant. One such custom is burying female children alive. In one of the scenes of the film, there is a demonstration of reception of the revelation sent to prophet Mukhammad and an intensive discussion of this revelation by followers of prophet Mukhammad. This shows the significance of this issue and Islam's attitude towards it, which was very negative and prohibiting. The new verse of the Quran prohibited and outlawed such a horrific practice. This was a reflection of the progressivity of Islam as a religion. Another scene that demonstrated progressivity of the Islam is a scene of redemption of a slave who refused to whip one of the prophet Mukhammad's envoys. Slaves were one of the most vulnerable groups of a society subjected to abuses from their owners and other different hardships of life. Such attention and care he received from the follower of prophet Mukhammad may be unusual, but not for the Muslims. They appreciated his sacrifice and worshipping one monotheistic God. Such mercy and attention towards a slave demonstrate a progressive and egalitarian perspective of early Muslims and the progressive character of Islam. All of these cases showing the progressive character of Islam contradict with perspectives of some European thinkers of the colonial age. As far as Ernest Renan is concerned, Islam is irrational religion incompatible with progress and science (\"Colonialism and Transformation of Muslim Societies\").

            "review_title": "'The Message' movie and its underlying Message",
            "content": "'The Message' Movie review\n'The Message' is controversial film directed by Moustapha Akkad in 1976 which depicts the chronic of the life of the Prophet Muhammad and the difficult time of his first followers who faced harsh opposition in the way of establishing Islam religion.\nPrecisely, historical epic presents the essential story of how the illiterate merchant son, Muhammad, received his first revelation in a Cave of Mount Hira. There, he was given the words of the Quran, and asked to spread the words and convert all the non-believers. The message Muhammad spreads splits the society into two opposing groups: the ones who are tied to the old rules and idolatry and the ones who are already converted into Islam. The clash gets evident, when Quraysh tribe, which has the major power in Mecca and sees Muhammad as a threat, start killing and torturing Muhammad's followers.\n\"One time or another all religions were rebellions\" - this quote from the movie (Lion of Judah, 49:35) does the best of proving that a novelty always faces opposition. The merchants, who are earning money by selling the idols which they claim to be gods (\"For years we worshiped wood and stone images of our own manufacture\"), are afraid that Muhammad's word about the one God will ruin their business and undermine their authority in front of slaves and the poor. As money reigns in Mecca, and there is no place for pure belief in God to be established, Muhammad and his followers go to Medina, where they increase in number. Though the opposition (Quraysh) is willing to do everything to stop Muhammad's new religious movement, and starts to attack him regularly, while Muhammad does as good as he can, not to spill any more blood than necessary.\nInterestingly, Muhammad is a central character of the film; however, as Islam forbids showing an image of God and holy figures, he was not to be shown on the screen: not even a part of a body shown, nor the voice heard. Whenever Muhammad was present, his presence was indicated by light organ music. The story is told through his uncle, Hamza (Anthony Quinn), and his other followers. Additionally, there are intriguing scenes where people speak directly to the screen. It is clear that they are talking to Muhammad, and the camera is his point of view (the camera evens nods and moves around like a human being walking around). Some viewers may get quite disoriented by the absence of Muhammad on the screen, but for me, it makes the divine present of Muhammad even stronger, and viewing the depiction of historical events through the eyes of Muhammad himself is enhancing the understanding and unleashing imagination.\nConsidering the prehistory of the movie, it was carefully prepared, as director of the movie consulted Islamic clerics in a thorough attempt to be respectful towards Islam and its views on portraying Muhammad. He received approval from Egypt but was rejected by the Muslim World League in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. Akkad saw the film as a way to bridge the gap between the Western and Islamic worlds. \"I felt that it was my obligation my duty to tell the truth about Islam. <... > I thought I should tell the story that will bring this bridge, this gap to the west,\" he said.\nAkkad's will to convey the Message to the west can be seen in the scene where Christianity and Islam first face each other. After listening to the Message of Muhammad spoken by his followers, the Lion of Judah understands that both religions root from the same headspring and have a lot in common. I consider it as a direct address and the Message to the Western world, which has many prejudices (terrorism and sharia) and often does not understand the Eastern world. In my view, this movie was an attempt to unite these two worlds, showing that they share the same values (human rights, women's rights, equality), believe in the power of law and stand for world peace.\nWhat I also enjoyed in depiction of early days of Islam religion is eluding the cruel scenes of followers of Muhammad. Some episodes of torturing people were shown, as well as episodes on the battle field, but blood scenes were not presented explicitly, as, director, presumably, did not want to focus viewers' attention on it and cause negative associations. What he actually made an emphasis on is universal values that Islam spreads. In the film, followers of Muhammad are of different racial affiliation, age and the background, as an additional proof of all-encompassing nature of Islam religion. Perhaps, that has made Islam one of the world religions.\nAnother appealing scene is the building of the first mosque in the city of Medina. The collaboration of citizens of Mecca and Medina and the team work of all men old and young is something beautiful to see. Their aspiration to build the mosque to pray together is inspiring, and the moment of all men embracing each other is touching. Then, the scene of choosing the man's voice as a call for all Muslims to come together is symbolic in terms of only man's ability to unite people and perhaps, reference to Muhammad preaching the word of God. \"Good work is another form of worshiping the God,\" uncle Hamza says Muhammad's words, and I think it is a good lesson that Islam teaches: be righteous, do the good deeds and embrace your neighbors.\nIn conclusion, the movie 'The Message' discovers the early days of Islam religion, depicting the harsh opposition faced by first followers of the prophet Muhammad. Moreover, the epic has the underlying Message to the Western world to abandon their prejudice and recognize the great amount of what all people have in common. From my point of view, the movie should be remade to be displayed on the big screens all other the world because this film, I believe, can be an effective tool for modern people to understand each other better.",

            "review_title": "Film Review on The Message",
            "content": "The Message (1976) by Mustapha Akkad displays the life of the Prophet Muhammad after the first revelations and the beginning and spread of Islam. The film shows a closer image of establishment of one of the biggest religions in the world, the obstacles it faced, and the socio-demographic disturbances as well as the change in the faith of individuals.The film is sufficient in presenting the chronicles of the life of the Prophet Muhammad and his ways in teaching Islam, even though there is no cinematographic depiction of him and his family members such as his wife, Khadija. The disclaimer at the beginning of the film explained such choice saying that \"the impersonation of the Prophet offends against the spirituality of his message\", which in fact corresponds to the prohibition of personalizing the religious figures in Islam. Despite the absence of the on-screen presence and his voice, one could understand the course of events with the help of the first-person point of view, the narrations and interaction of his followers, accurately presented to the viewer: Prophet's friend Abu Bakr, his adopted son Zaid, his uncle Abu Talib and others, whom we can see in other literature such as The Life of Muhammad by Sirat Rassul Allah (1955).The film gives an insightful view of the pre-Islamic Arabian society, its social and economic conditions. As explained in the Lecture on Early Islam, the Mecca, where the film starts, was predominantly polytheistic before the establishment of Islam. The modern day Ka'ba which is the symbol of one God served as a home for many Gods, which are placed inside and worshipped. The polytheistic nature of the religion flourished with the help of advanced trade in Mecca as displayed by the film: the city gathered a tremendous number of merchants and consequently served as a religious center for various beliefs people believed in. There were Gods for health, prosperity, family and tribes, caravans, etc. and claiming only one God meant to deny those Gods which was considered unreasonable and blasphemous. Not only it contradicted the common religious belief, it possessed potential economic losses for the Mecca.The cinematographic display of the Islamic origins agrees with the lecture given by Fred Donner, explaining the emergence of Islam as a movement of Believers who gave emphasis on peace and equality of people, which was absent in the pre-Islamic Arab society. The film showed the economic inequality between the rulers of the city and common people, the gender inequality which involved killing newborn female infants as told by the mother of one of the Prophet's followers and the slavery. Alongside the religious motives, the idea of equality was contrary to the former society's beliefs, because it was considered as breaking the social order. That is one of the reasons why Islam faced a major opposition, that complements the words of Ashama King of Abyssinia: \"at one time or another all religions were rebellious\".The Message also shows the relationship of followers of Islam with other religious representatives and Empires. One of those interactions can be seen in the fragment of Muslim migration to Abyssinia after facing a persecution in Mecca. In the conversation between the Ashama King and Muslim representatives there were revealed similarities between Jews, Christians and Muslims namely the belief in the book of one God and the notion that Prophets Abraham, Noah, Moses, Jesus Christ, and Muhammad received revelations from the same God. Convinced by the Muslim representative, Ashama King acknowledged the similarity between the faiths and said that Islam and Christianity are \"two rays from the same lamp\". At the times of Islamic Prosperity, the main aim of the Muslims was the spread of Islam, precisely in the regions of Byzantium, Persian Empire, and Alexandria.Though not directly shown, we can see the formation of the Quran throughout the film. This starts right from the beginning when Muhammad receives revelation from the Gabriel in the cave. Later his adopted son Zaid walks out of his house and shows the scripted words on the paper to his people saying \"This is the word of God\", which marks the beginning of the sacred book Quran. Since the ayats in the Quran correspond to various situations in the Prophet's life, throughout the film different revelations come to Prophet and his followers are informed about it. Remembering the division of chapters into Mecca and Medina, one can understand the thematic difference between them: if Meccan chapters include chapters on theological themes, the Medina chapters are about social and political life of people, as it was the main focus of political polity of Muhammad after the Hijra, migration to Mecca. It can be seen in the scene of dispute between Meccan and Medina societies, when the revelation came saying that people of Muhammed should fight those who fight them.To sum up, The Message serves as an efficient introductory material on the origins of Islam, giving informative insights about the emergence and establishment of one of the biggest religions through the eyes of people of that times.",

            "review_title": "A good historical movie the Message (1976)",
            "content": "Islam, as a Judaism and Christianity, takes its roots from the East coast of the Mediterranean but is not alike mentioned religions well understood in the West. As long as Westerns do not consider Islam as the part of their history, the early Islamic history is not being studied. However, Moustapha Akkad, born Muslim and raised in Hollywood, believed that history of Islam must be known by Westerns and produced the movie called The Message (1976) as a way to diminish the gap between the Western and Muslim community. The movie serves as the dramatized representation of the life of the Islamic prophet Muhammad by chronicling the events of Arabian Peninsula in 610 - 630 years. I suppose that the author successfully portrays the Islamic history from Sunni Muslim perspective, especially I found the movie very helpful to resolve the misunderstanding of Islamic view in regard to women. Still, I don't know if people of distinct faiths will be imbued with the feelings of Muslims whom this story probably familiar from childhood, but they will be able to find out something new for themselves about the epoch which shows Arabia as a cultural, intellectual, and economic center.Worthwhile to mention that authors simultaneously filmed two versions of the story: one in Arabic with Arab actors released in 1976, and another in English with UK actors launched one year later. Thus, the intended audience was not only non-Muslims but also Islamic continent even if the primary goal of the producer was to reach the Westerns. The scenario was written by novel writes from all over the world in order to produce a truthful biographical movie. Moreover, while writing the scenario authors specifically consulted with Islamic clerics and received the approval from the University of Al-Azhar in Cairo and the High Islamic Congress of the shiat in Lebanon. The following approval helped Akkad to raise money for movie production from Morocco King Hassan II. But one year after shooting in Morocco, the author was forced to stop the process because of Saudi Arabian pressure on Morocco stating that the movie was rejected by World Muslim League in Mecca. Fortunately, Akkad was able to receive the support from Libya's leader Gaddafi and continued production for another 6 months. This fact indicates that the movie was strongly opposed by Shia Muslims and supported by Sunni's, accordingly the followers of Muhammad son in law Ali and his friend Abu Bakr. Still, I didn't find any bias towards Ali - as long as his face not shown in the movie, like the picture of the messenger of the God - Muhammad. Director of the movie Akkad tried to be obedient to the strict framework of Islam and shows neither the face, nor the hands, nor the voice of the prophet and his first followers Ali and Abu Bakr.Even if the absence of an image of the main character may seem awkward and other actors are talking to a silent interlocutor just by looking straight into the camera, it gives the film a certain mystery rein to the imagination. It was plausible to watch the playing of other characters and their battles since the movie has a good resolution of the image. The costume of the 6th century Arabs was well decorated as well. Especially, I loved the women clothes which can relate to the contemporary discourse that hijab is a cultural, not a Muslim phenomenon. Furthermore, the music of the movie, which I found really breathtaking, was written by Maurice Jarre and nominated for the Best Original Score to the best substantial body of music.Considering the plot of the movie, it starts with the same message of prophet Muhammad sent to the patriarch of Alexandria - Cyrys and the king of Persia - Kersa, which depicts the given name of the movie The Message. Then the story goes back to the city Mecca, where the forty years old Mohammad met an angel in the mountains, who betrayed to him the miracle holy book Quran and declared him the last prophet. After returning to home, the new Messiah found for himself faithful followers, who from now on proclaimed the message \"God is one and his prophet is Mohammed\". They spread the idea that the strong should not oppress the weak and the reach should not the fraud the poor. And girls should not be forced into marriage but be able to choose or refuse. Moreover, they were strongly against the burial of newborn girls, as long as God said to the prophet that women are equal to men. During that period of the time, the citizens of Mecca worshiped more than three hundred Gods by being the rich trading city, the message of Mohammed provoked aggressive opposition from the bureaucrats. Thus, the bearers of the new faith had to prove their devotion to the new religion through blood and suffering. Somewhere by selflessness, somewhere by the rhetoric but mostly by martial arts in the battles, such as in Badr and Uhud, these people won the respect of new and new adherents, and quite successfully, given that Islam is now the second widespread religions in the world.Overall, I would recommend the film to the lovers of old movies with good battle scenes and people seeking for good historical movie on a religious theme, not depending on their faith.",

            "content": "A 3-hour long religious epic chronicling the life & times of the Islamic prophet Muhammad while also serving as an informative historical account of the depicted era, The Message makes for a fascinating introduction to the early history of Islamic faith and covers how the religion came to be, the persecution & exile that followed and the ultimate victory that established Mecca as the centre of Muslim world.Directed by Moustapha Akkad, the story has its own share of intrigue, conflicts & drama and is crafted in accordance with the religious beliefs & sensibilities when it comes to the depiction of the prophet who's neither seen nor heard. The camera serves as his point-of-view on occasion while his disciples speak his words on his behalf. The film is respectful in that way and honours what's forbidden in Islamic tradition.Still, for what is a 178 mins long ride, the journey is tedious & overlong and the interest starts to fizzle out sooner than later. Akkad does what he can with the limited resources available to him but the sweeping cinematic qualities are sorely missing here and the low production value & no build-up for any event doesn't help the cause either. And performances are serviceable at best, with only Anthony Quinn managing to impress.Overall, The Message provides an interesting overview of the prophet's life and an easy enough understanding of Islam to acquaint everyone with its message of peace & harmony. My interest in the picture was purely academic, for subjects of God & religion are nonsensical in my humble opinion. But if one's religion helps bring them inner peace or compels them to be good to others then faith isn't entirely without its merits. Worth a shot.",

            "review_title": "The message",
            "content": "Islam is a monotheistic religion, which came with the last and ultimate Prophet of God - Muhammad. He was an illiterate man, who could accept the words of God in the mountains and present it as Quran. The name of the film - \"The Message\" also indicates the fact, that Muhammad as the Messenger of God, could bring up the true words of God to all people. The film effectively illustrates the most important historical scenes in the life of Muhammad, and the central concepts of Islam.\"The Message\" clearly demonstrates that the central concept of Islam is believing and worshipping one god and accepting his prophet. Every person who wants to accept Islam says: \"There is no god, but God, and Muhammad is his messenger\". This means that there is only single God who must be worshipped, and he send his words to Muhammad. This concept is clearly shown by destruction of idols of about 300 gods inside the Kaaba in Mecca. Muslims believe that God is invisible to eyes, you cannot make his figure from wood. Islam also prohibits drawing pictures of human, animals, making the statues of animate objects, because one can worship them and can encourage the idolatry. It can be the reason of that Prophet Muhammad is also was not shown in the film at all, and only his presence was indicated. Although Muhammad is the messenger of God, he is also must not be worshipped. This can be seen when Muslims do not bow to Muhammad and they depict him as just ordinary man. Muhammad makes the stones from the sand, carries them, and helps to build the first mosque ever in the city of Medina. So, even if he is a prophet, he does all the jobs which his followers do.One of the most important things that capture attention is the topic of equality. Equality of everyone in the face of God: man and woman, all the races, tribes and nations, orphans, rich and poor. Film points out the fact that girls are buried by her family after birth before Islam. Mother of one of the early followers of Muhammad accepted Islam right after she heard that the religion is against this custom, since she lost two sisters because of that tradition. It is clear from the film that men could buy, use and discard women as they wanted. Quran claimed that women are equal to men, they also have rights to inheritance of wealth, girls must not be forced to marriage, they can choose or refuse. Moreover, it is known that early civilizations used black people as slaves, and did not treat them equal to their selves. As Islam said that there are no races on Earth, and everyone is same, black slaves also started following Muhammad, and Muslims supported them. In the film, it is shown by redemption of Bilal, one of the first black slaves that joined the group of the Prophet. Also, later, when Muslims build their first mosque, they asked Bilal to use his voice to call and attract the people, as bells in the churches. This again depicts the equality of all races in the film. The concept of equality is supported further in the scene of Battle of Badr, when one reject ordinary soldiers to fight by saying that they do not worthy of them. But, Muslims again points that all people are equal, and the social order do not give any privilege in the face of God. The film also mentions the pilgrimage to Kaaba, where everyone wears two pieces of white clothing, that helps to understand and shows that all people are the same and equal. It removes all the indicators of wealth, race, education and social status.Islam is a religion of peace. According to Islamic tradition, \"God never loves the starter of wars\". Quran does not justify the one who kills, sheds the blood. However, Muslims can fight with people who fight against them, persecute them. We see it from the battles of Badr, Uhud, the wars to conquer the Mecca, the place where Muhammad firstly received the words of God. Even if it is a war, Islam prohibits killing the children, women, old, disabled person, cut down the trees, and fight only a man who fight and have expelled on you. Also, if enemies accept defeat and stop fighting against, Muslims also must stop and do not continue the war. It is shown in the film, by Hamza, uncle of Muhammad who told the right discipline of fighting and stopped the war when enemies have stopped.The aspect of Islamic tradition, that says that God uses all the chances to forgive the sins of those who asks sincerely, is shown at the end of the film. Most of the citizens of Mecca who before worshipped idols, finally came to Muhammad accepting the Islam. In the film, followers of Muhammad treat with understanding people who have doubts in their hearts about the God and his Prophet. Because Quran says that some need few minutes, some need years to come to the truth. Muslims believe that if one regrets his mistakes, and asks forgiveness from God, they would be excused. So, even the people who fought against Muhammad and his followers, can accept Islam, one God, and be forgiven.To sum up, the film illustrates history of the birth of Islam by life of Muhammad and the main concepts of religion. It is clear that Islam spread and became even stronger, as merchants of Mecca wanted to get rid of them. The concepts of gender, social status, race equality, peace, faith could find the way to the hearts of many people. The soul, belief in one God and its Messenger is the central concepts of Islamic tradition.",

            "content": "This is a feature film about the prophet Muhammad and his message. The creators of the film mentioned the main Islamic rule at the very beginning of the film, the rule that the prophet can't per portrayed of illustrated, so he will not appear in the film. It is a very smart choice from the religious perspective, as it goes along with Muslim principles, but also an interesting director choice. They show the prophet's message, without showing Muhammad himself, in order to illustrate it through the society of that time and influence that that message had on people. This film illustrates the birth of Early Islam at the time when Kaaba was still a house of pagan gods. It shows all main events from the first revelation that Muhammad had to the moment of his death. This film focuses on the conflict that Muslims had with the pagans who run Mecca at that time. This film also shows a basis for the quote in Quran that sometimes can be understood in the wrong way. \"You should fight non-believers (pagans). This film is full of historical facts, moments that were illustrated in Quran, and Muslim traditions, depicted throughout the whole film.\nIt all starts with the first revelation that Muhammad received from the angel Gabriel. From the lectures, we know that it has a significant meaning, as the prophet wrote it down even though he was illiterate. In the film, they highlighted the significance of this event and also presented the contrast of the perception by showing city authorities who were very sceptical about it. However, later on, they say that Muhammad tells about his revelations to one of his literate followers to write them down. It is the start of the composition of the Quran.\nAlso, in this film, they depict the life of the community of Mecca and that time. The director highlights the immoral behaviour that is common for this society. They collect money from people to put idols of their gods in Kaaba, kill female children, treat women as their property and buy slaves. On the other hand, Muhammad preaches humanism, that all people are equal and should be treated in the same way. Muhammad's followers were not welcomed in Mecca, whey and their families were tortured in order to make them change their belief. This is the moment when they introduce the main concept of all Abrahamic religions, is the God is One. So this fact became a major point of conflict with the pagan population of Mecca, so Muslims had to leave the city.\nThere also was shown a relationship with other Abrahamic religions, such as Christianity. In this film, they showed, that they have similar beliefs and tolerated each other. The only disagreement that they had was the origin of Jesus Christ. Muslims believe that the was one of God's prophets, while Christians considered him to be a son of God. However, the agreed that this is the only difference that they had. This is how Muslims who run from Mecca found a safe place in Abyssinia, that had a Christian ruler.\nLater, this film showed one of the main events in the history of Islam, Hichra. The moment when Muslims migrated to the city of Medina, as Muhammad was asked to become an arbiter for local tribal groups. This is the event from which the Muslim calendar starts. It was the beginning of the Muslim autonomous community. Further into the film, they start to show the details of everyday life, and establishment of the small traditions, such as the voice that calls everyone for the pray (namaz).\nThe key moment of the film is when Meccan governors decide to get rid of all property that Muhammad's followers left back at home. They couldn't stand it, so this was a moment when they turned to their prophet and asked him if they can fight against those who attack them. This film depicted how desperate they all were at that moment, as they couldn't stop following the concept of piety, that was very important to early Muslims, as we know from the lectures. So Muhammad said, that those pagans, who attack Muslims should be fought against and destroyed, as a defence. This is one of the turning points in the history of Islam. They went on a War with the authorities of Mecca and they won it. Muslims returned to the city of Mecca and made it a sacred space for all Muslims, a city of God. They were very humanistic, they saved the lives of its citizens. This shows another part of Islamic religion, as it was very interconnected with the state, so Muhammad became their both political and religious leader.\nThe film ends at the death of the prophet, but it shows that Islam only continued to grow. His followers travelled to other countries and preached Islam to them. So in this conflict with the pagans of Mecca, Muslims were winners. They returned their city and continued to grow, proving that Muhammad was a real prophet, as God was on their side.",

            "content": "This is one of my favorite movies, i never have enough watching it. each time is like seeing it for the first time. the Arabic version of it is just as excellent with a all Arab actors. the director did an excellent job to have the same events depicted in both versions, without settling for dubbing one version. Antony Q. really shines the same way Abdulla Gaith does in the Arabic version. Al Aqad is definitely an excellent example of using art as a way of telling people about the greatness of Islam---bringing people of different races and cultures and tribes to unite and yet be different. I especially love the part when the prophet's uncle Hamza (played by Antony Q.) comes to Mecca and directly goes to defend the prophet and his companions who try to defend him against those assaulting them. He then slaps one of the leaders daring him to hit him back, then addressing his nephew, he announces his faith in the new message and confessing that whenever he crosses the desert at night he feels the creator is too grand to be kept in the tiny building where the tribe kept their deity. The other favorite is when Khalid bin Al Walid fights the war against the Muslims and then converts before the Prophet (pbuh). I hope everyone who watches the movie would be able to see the genius of the director and the story by comparing it to the movies that were around during the same time. Do not let the fact that it is about Islam of Muslims blind you to the fact that it is about a great leader of people and the people who believed in his message that he was chosen to deliver, and he did despite all challenges. Try to think from a historical point of view, do not allow the current events taking place prevent you from having a more open view to look at things. The area is not the map. Try looking at the whole map to have a better understanding. the view differs when you're standing in a ditch, hill, mountain, flying. always try to find the bigger picture.",

            "review_title": "The message that were sent to hearts",
            "content": "\"The Message\" is a historical drama that narrates the history of development of early Islam. The name of the film was chosen on point and it implies that Islam embodied in Quran is the message of God (Allah) and Prophet Muhammad is his messenger. The face, body and voice of Muhammad were not depicted in the movie in accordance with muslim canons which prohibited drawings of animals and people. Worship of God and study of the Quran, the revelation of God, are two major principles that muslims around the world follow. Other than that, the movie conveys powerful ideas about Islam and people may know a lot during watching this movie. What we can learn from Islam is that there is only one God who cannot be seen and who is immortal, and the Prophet Muhammad is the messenger of God. Significant stories and his moments of life are portrayed in the movie, however his story starts only from him being 40 years old. He was an illiterate shepherd in Mecca until angel Gabriel spoke to him and shared the words of God so Muhammad told them to his comrades who wrote them down. However, this was not welcomed by Quraysh, the dominating Arab tribe of Mecca as their belief contradicted to monotheistic Islam. Mecca in those times was a holy place for different people who believed in different and various gods, idolatries and paganism. But soon, Muhammad fulfilled what he was supposed to do and by conveying the message of God to crowds, Mecca became the home of muslims and the Kaaba became the object of Hajj.\nIt was said in the movie that Muhammad stormed people's hearts, not the walls, so the same can be said about Islam as a religion. I also liked how Islam was presented as peaceful and tolerant religion towards Christianity and Judaism and acknowledged their prophets. Islam is intended to teach people peace and equality. According to Islam, all the people were born free and equal, moreover people who are embraced by faith in Islam can name themselves brothers despite diversity of nations, races and tribes. It is also a lesson from the film. We can see how Muhammad was winning the hearts of the people around him, so they accepted Islam. One explicit example is a man who initially was a slave, but proved his faith in God and contributed a lot in the development of Islam. People accepted Islam and Muhammad as the messenger of God as he transmitted right morals and ideas into the masses. In many ways, Islam opposed current traditions and lifestyle of people in Mecca for the good. In the response to slavery and inequality between rich and poor, Islam was stating that \"people should not starve...The strong should not oppress the weak\". Additionally, Islam stated that the \"girls should not be forced into marriage,\" but to choose to marry or refuse. Such teachings from Islam contradicted to established traditions of the local nation. The film shows how people in authority of Mecca thought only of wealth as we see them always relaxing in their palaces watching performances of dancers and eating delicious food. Maintaining idolatry in Mecca was in their interest because people used to come there and spend their money. Mecca was a center of trade also. Quraysh tribe members saw gods as worship and revenue, so we can assume that their faith was not real but blinded by wealth and money. Contrary to them, Muhammad and his comrades were preaching, discussing the words of God, thinking of possibilities of sharing his words to all people. In other words, the loyalty to God was the first priority. In addition to that, there was voiced some interesting though in the end of the movie that those who worshipped Muhammad should know that he is dead, but God is alive and he must be worshipped. It symbolizes that gracious God is above all and before all and though everyone is equal, the best among people is one \"who most regards God\".\nOverall, Mecca as well as other Arab regions was autonomous since the ruling was decentralized and the power lied in hands of powerful tribes and families. This was the period of Jahaliyya characterized by the period of ignorance, lack of a legitimate law system and frequent violation of citizens' rights. Most people were illiterate and there were starving people who lived almost next to wealthy ones. The society was disorganized, we can say. The conversion of Mecca to Islam established a better system of justice, decent morals and laws. Besides, as it was told in the film, God praises those who read and study, so people had an opportunity to learn reading and writing, which became a step towards literate and educated society.\nIn conclusion, it is interesting how this film and the very idea of Islam intersects with Mircea Eliade's theory about sacred and profane spaces. As he suggests, the sacred space was giving orientation in the world through hierophanies. The same analogy can be traced in the film. Mecca before conversion to Islam was not a good place to live, with some bad and inhumane traditions. But after, the Islam came there, equality and peace came there as well as better principles of living declared by the Quran. The film shows the development of Islam and how this religion was winning people's hearts despite the wars with opposition, deaths and other difficulties. I really enjoyed watching the film and I would recommend others to watch it for the sake of learning concepts and philosophy of Islam. \"The message\" is a good film which portrays genuine and authentic religion of Islam that reflect powerful ideas about peace, love, forgiveness, equality and faith in one God who unites vast number of people.",

            "content": "The movie \"The Message\" is one of the well-known films in the Islamic world and one of my favourites. The main plot of the film can be known by its name, it is about the coming of a new religion to the prophet Muhammad (s.a.w) as a message. The movie begins with receiving the first Quranic verses from God by dint of Angel Gabriel in the cave. The prophet Muhammad (s.a.w) is not shown or visually or vocally demonstrated in some way in the movie due to Islamic law. However, other prominent characters are played by actors. Generally, the film is about the spread of the Islam religion, its hardships and blessings from its beginning and until the death of the prophet. In this movie review, we will discuss each significant events that were shown in the movie and introduce the characters.\nThe distribution of Islam started step by step, person by person and called people to believe and pray to one and only God (Allah in Islam). The main reason for that is the majority of the people in Mecca deteriorated so much, worshipped 300 Gods in Ka'abah, bury their alive daughters due to their pride among the people and slavery. Due to the fact that Islam induces people to do good deeds and evoke people to avoid things that were mentioned before. In the movie, the hardships that the new Muslim people experienced because they followed Muhammad's religion.\nThe first thing that we have to mention is the way which demonstrates the Pre-Islamic and Islamic periods. Due to Islamic law, not showing the faces, voices of the prophet and his family is a perfect decision because there is a chance that when some Muslim people pray they can associate the faces in the movie as real and the value of the religion can be vanished. For instance, in Christian tradition people carry the portrait of Jesus where it can be changed during the years and cannot be quantified as real. Prophet Muhammad (s.a.w) was born in Mecca and from the Quraiysh tribe which was one the influential clans. However, despite the fact that the prophet Muhammad (s.a.w) was from the influential clan, the fact that he was an orphan hurt pride of the people that disturbed them to believe in one God and admit his prophety.\nAs I mentioned earlier the movie itself shows the hardships that prophet and his followers experienced. For instance, oppression of people, accused them with bad words, didn't even sell them their things. Moreover, one the signifacant examples in the movie is the situation of the Bilal who was the black slave in Mecca. Due to the fact that Islam teaches people that each person lives are matter and everybody are the same despite their skin colour, it was hard to confess this fact for rich Quraiysh people. The sequence of that kind of events occurred frequently and it impacted people to leave their homeland. Some of these followers escaped to Abyssinia, finding shelter under the king's protection. They move north, where they are welcomed warmly in Medina and help to establish the first Islamic mosque. They are told that their belongings are being sold on the trade in Mecca. For a brief moment, Muhammad prefers peace, but he is still granted permission to strike. In the Battle of Uhud, the Mecca people fought back with three thousand soldiers, killing Hamza (the prophet's uncle). The Muslims follow the Meccans, leaving the camp undefended. As a result, they are startled by riders approaching from behind and lose the fight. After that,10-year truce has been reached between the Meccans and the Muslims. A few years later, the people like Halid Ibn Walid and some influential Huraiyshs accepted the Islam and considered as one the devotees. After some years, Muslims take control of Mecca. The idol god images in the Kaaba are destroyed, and Bilaal Ibn Rabaah called the first azan in Mecca on the Kaaba.Finally, I really enjoy the movie because it shows the brief history of the Islam religion. Moreover, as I mentioned earlier, the protection of women and black people that is the current problem in the world were considered and solved 1400 years ago.It depicts pivotal points in the history of Islam and Muhammad's life. It satisfies one's need to learn more about Islam and history's greatest human being. It is highly important in providing the message that Islam is a peaceful faith. In today's world, some extremists who identify as Muslims are murdering people in the name of Islam. This film depicts the true Islam, which is peaceful, as opposed to what the public sees.",

This was because the main characters, Mohammed and his family could not be portrayed in accordance with Islamic tradition. This left the director, Moustapha Akkad, in a difficult position, how do you tell as story without ever showing the protagonist? He does as good as a job as could be hoped for, having characters repeat what Mohammed says to them and speak directly into the camera when addressing the Prophet. But they were forced to have Mohammed's uncle, Hamas, played by Anthony Quinn, serve as a de facto protagonist. While he does well, it is like telling the story of the Gospels without showing Jesus and having John the Baptist as the main character.The film was also clearly make with a Muslim audience in mind, as it was not overly accessible to someone who was not familiar with the story or characters. It took almost half of the film for me to be figure out who all of the characters were and how they were connected. By the ending and the final battles, it really felt like \"Lawrence of Arabia\" but without the central character that the audience could connect to and rally around.",

The Arabs were transferred from the darkness of ignorance,inhumanity, backwardness to the light of freedom, justice, and a higher state of consciousness unprecedented in the history of the arabs. Even though the Prophet lived to see he is work done, his message would transform the world at large through spread of Islam. As a Muslim watching the movie, though this might sound silly, but it fealt like that I was time travelling. I felt I was there in the presence of the Prophet. Though I really enjoyed the movie, there is some things I question. For one if Islam gave greater rights to women long before the west, it should have shown active women among the muslims, not necessarily the wives of the prophet, for it is understandable concerning tradition, but it should have portrayed this for the non-muslim western viewers. The reason being that islam is perceived as misogynistic in the west. Other than that all other teachings of islam were definitely embodied in this film. Hopefully, in this century, the Western media would abandon the distorted image of Islam.",

            "content": "This film is absolutely forgotten today. We are all tired of seeing, at Easter and Christmas Eve every year, biblical films or films involving Jesus in some way. This does not happen with films about Islam, which for us in Portugal is a religion that tells us little (although we spent some part of our history, as a country, at war with Muslims). I think that the skewed way in which we see the Muslim faith, the result of recent events, terrorism and fundamentalism, also helped to bury these films. This, in particular, also has the disadvantage that the central character of the plot - Muhammad - cannot be shown or heard. A rule of Islamic religion.The film shortly recounts Muhammad's life and preaching, and the way he became a religious and military leader, going against the authorities of Mecca, the current polytheistic religion and his family until he imposed himself, by the word and - not least - by the strength of the sword. A true story, therefore, but one that is never explored by Western cinema due to religious rashes. It is understandable: most Muslims can be understanding, but the fear of the West is radicalized minorities, willing to blow bombs in the cinema studio that dare to show the Prophet's sacred ear. Personally, I coped well with the character's absence, but the overwhelming majority of the Western audience quickly ignored the film.The effort to co-produce this film was remarkable at the time. We have Americans, English, Arabs, Moroccans, Libyans and other nationalities involved. The difficulties were also many, and part of the money for the film ended up coming from the hands of Libyan President Gaddafi, which is quite unusual, but understandable, at the time it was. I also appreciated the effort that the production made to be historically rigorous and faithful to the events described.The film has a vast cast, but we need to highlight, of course, Anthony Quinn, as an uncle of the Prophet, Irene Papas, who gave life to the vindictive Hind, wife of the Meccan ruler, Abu Sofyan, played by Michael Ansara. These three actors stood out the most and did a competent job with the material they received. Still, I don't think it will be the best film for any of them.Technically, it is a very well-made film, at the level of epic super-productions of its time: the sets were exquisitely well done, the costumes are detailed, all things exudes a certain atmosphere of credibility and respect, for the history and for the religion of those who believe in Muhammad's message. Cinematography is a little dated and the colors seem washed out, but that did not detract from the film's visual beauty. The soundtrack is quite good and is in the ear, and the initial credits are interesting, with the representation of the faithful from various places in the world where Islam is present today.",

            "content": "As I am writing this review, this film has an IMDb rating of 8.4, which is fairly impressive. However, don't let the rave reviews fool you as they fooled me.I think one main reason why this film gets as many kudos as it does is the fact that it's makers took a HUGE risk --- they made a movie about the life of the Prophet Mohammed, who is generally not depicted in mainstream Islam. Well, really, this movie did not really change that last point. Mohammed himself is not seen or heard in the film to prevent offending Muslim sensibilities. The idea is that depicting Mohammed will lead to idolatry, which, of course, is supposed to be evil. Instead, it is told from the perspective of his uncle Hamza. Also in keeping with Islamic custom, none of Mohammed's close companions (such as Abu Bakr) or immediate family members (such as his wives or his daughter Fatima) are depicted. In fact, these people are either not mentioned in the movie or barely mentioned at all. The absence of Mohammed and company makes this film quite difficult to swallow. Imagine making a movie about Jesus... without Jesus himself. Furthermore, there are no disciples, no Virgin Mary or Joseph, and no Mary Magdalene. Would it be a very effective film? I highly doubt it. Furthermore, not depicting the Prophet only makes him seem more divine and actually promotes idolatry! Mohammed's invisible, ghostly presence, complete with spooky music whenever he enters the scene, only makes him seem more god-like. Compare \"The Message\" to \"Ben Hur,\" for instance. In Ben Hur, Jesus' face is observed and his voice is not heard (as far as I remember). However, this is done to make Jesus look MORE, not less, divine. \"The Message\" is very pro-Muslim, which itself is not a bad thing. After all, couldn't most Jesus films be described as pro-Christian? However, the script presents the merits of the Islamic faith in such a cheesy, clumsy way that it's hard to take seriously. The screen writers of this film probably used every clich\u00e9d catch-phrase about how wonderful Islam is that they could find in a Muslim propaganda pamphlet. It's also Ironic that this movie places so much emphasis on how Islam promotes women's rights, considering that it completely ignores Mohammed's close female relatives. Actually depicting and narrating the stories of strong female characters like Aisha, Khadijah, and Fatima would do more justice to Muslim women than repeating clich\u00e9d phrases about how \"Mohammed ended female infanticide!\" or whatnot. The acting is decent, at least by Quinn, and the cinematography is quite good. However, the script just makes the whole film, and even early Islamic history itself, seem silly. Both Muslims and Non-Muslims alike deserve better. My advice would be to wait until some brave film maker actually has the guts to make a Mohammed movie with the full cast of characters. Watch this film if you are genuinely interested in Islam or Islamic history and want to see a brave, if not very successful, take on the prophet's life. DO NOT watch this film as an introduction to Islam --- buy a book. If you want a great epic film that takes place in the Middle East, see \"Lawrence of Arabia\" or \"Ben Hur\" instead.",

They are just imitating Muslim people to pollute Islam religion. Islam has never been a \"religion of carnage\". Watch this good movie and see what Islam is based on. Quran-i Kerim (The Book of Islam) It's text never been changed so far and will never be changed in the future. It's still in original state and will be.Some of users said: Hz Muhammed has 23 Wives. His wives are not really wives. Most of them are destitute people that need help. Hz Mohammad patronages them and gave them a good life. Islamiyet's one of the first orders is: * \"Do not fornicate\" ( Having sex without marrying someone ) The God says in the Quran-i Kerim: Islam is the last religion and Mohammad is the last prophet. The Books of Religions are all writs of the \"Same God\". The Books were \"Tevrat\"(the Old Testament) , \"Zebur\" , \"Incil\"(The New Testament) , And last and the most big one \"Kur'an-i Kerim\" (Quran)Some reviewers are saying: Islam is based on war. So i should ask you, If some people had stolen all of your valuable items and and make your houses a wreck, and come for war, what would you do ? Escape like a chicken ? And again. In Wars to Protect the future of the religion of god, children and women never hurt, closed doors never broken, workers not hurt, trees weren't cut. The only thing is to war with your armed enemies. And even falled enemies don't hurt to kill them completely.Hz Muhammad could make the Makka fall with his very crowded army. But He didn't. He protected \"The Caba\" which was given by god to the Prophet Ibrahim to make that place worship center to pray for \"the One God\".In the Islam religion there is no preassure. Some people believe within several minutes, some people believe it within years. But some people are afraid of read the Book of Islam (Which includes all writs of old \"One God\" Books) A Note: One of Islam's commands says that: you must not preassure people believed in other \"The One God\" religions to make them Muslim. Becoming a Muslim is a choice given to all people.Final Question: Although everything about Islam Why are some people forcing Islam to show as a \"religion of assasinating\" Final Note: This Movie's story is completely confirmed by Historians.",

            "content": "\"The Message\" is a movie directed by Moustapha Akkad, which portrays the birth and the growth of Islam within Prophet Muhammed's life. Produced with religious respect to not show the face of the Prophet, this film delivers the struggles of believers, the name given to Muslims by Fred Donner, which I think would be more appropriate for Muslims of that time.\nBeing raised in a polytheistic community, believers went against their roots in search of the truth. Believers were suffering from poverty, were robbed, prosecuted, dismembered, and killed, but never did they give up on their belief in one God only. As Islam was born in the period of socio-economic crisis, the movie greatly depicts the main pillars of Islam, highlights the voice of the silent, and explains why a believer should be worthwhile of God's decision to give a believer life.\nThe starting scene of the crowd, holding different idols and performing sacrifices, next to the Kaaba right from the beginning illustrates that this place, just like a melting pot, welcomes all Gods of this world. The short dialogue between Abu Safiyan and Umaya over the duty to count of the latter makes it clear that by allowing more Gods to \"inhibit\" Kaaba, the merchants are able to keep having a life filled with luxury and power. While this keeps them on track, the message delivered by the Prophet completely cuts their \"business\". The idea of Shahadah, or Declaration of Faith, the first pillar of Islam, that includes recognition of one God only, and Muhammad as His messenger, is seen through the negligence of these characters to accept this idea and further prosecution of Muhammad's followers from Mecca.\nFleeing their home, the scene of followers building a mosque next to the Prophet's house in Yathrib to perform prayers is a depiction of the second pillar, the daily prayer or Salat. What is interesting, is that even the small detail of Muslims going down to oasis to perform ablution in the oasis on their way to Mecca highlights the strict following this pillar despite the given circumstances. The decision to travel to Mecca unarmed as pilgrims, despite the possibility of being slaughtered, is a portrayal of another pillar of Islam called Hajj. The detail of all pilgrims wearing identical white clothes conveys the sense of unity of God's followers, making it understandable that believers are brothers to one another and there is nothing that would make them think the other way around.\nThere are two pillars left that, I believe, were not given that much attention: zakat, almsgiving (although there was always someone saying that there is a need to feed the poor), and sawn or fasting during Ramadan, which I think were not relevant for director in delivering the development of Islam. Yet the movie is\nPersonally, it is intriguing and fascinating that every time Muslims encountered a problem, right at that time the Prophet revealed God's guidance or blessings on the ways to cope with it. Since Islam witnessed Jahaliyya, the period of ignorance and stupidity, with prevalent violence against black people and no sense of rule, the answer to such a crisis was sent through the calling to the equality of men and women in front of God. The story of how girls were buried alive told by Ammar's mother, who died as a first martyr of Islam, reveals how Islam was giving a chance to those, who were never considered to be heard, to matter. Another rather metaphorical example of how Islam gave a voice to those, who were never able to speak for themselves, is portrayed through the decision of letting Bilal, black slave of Abu Safyan, to stand at the top of the mosques and call Muslims to prayers. The whole city was silent and his voice was reaching each corner of the city and Muslims'heartst. I find this moment to be the most beautiful scene in this movie.\nIt was mentioned in Rahman's \"Major Themes of the Quran\" that the Quran never pushes someone to do certain things because of the \"fear of God\". Whenever the believer gravitates towards evil, God is with him, whenever he or she excels at something, God is with them. This notion is depicted through the conversion of those, who shed blood and raised a sword against Islam. The Prophet did not reject Khalif or Abu Safiyan when they came to him, those who were desperately tried to kill him. Neither did Bilal, for whom Abu Safiyan prescribed punishment, told to his torturer that he was not welcomed here. Instead, they all acknowledge that it was God's mercy upon them, to challenge them, to whom God gave his own spirit, so they can find the long-awaited truth as \"God does not change the situation of a people until they change it themselves\" (13.ar-Ra'd:11; 8.al-Anfal:53).\nAs this movie covers the development of Islam in the time of Prophet Muhammad, I suppose that the movie was able to reflect the way Islam was seen as moral support, a driving force that allowed believers to combat injustice. It was the sincere love and loyalty to God, in the end, that let believers live a life of piety and peace.",

Editing was also superb bringing out continuity between various events in the film as well as not covering some events in history which would have extended the plot. Actors, especially Irene Papas and Antony Quinn were very good. The development of the plot enhanced the title of the film - Muhammad's messages to various rulers of the world. The battles fought are incidental and are seen purely justified. Muhammad is at first reluctant to fight the Meccans. Muhammad also shows mercy to them after their defeat. The scenery and traditional Arab music very good. Comment at the beginning, middle and end of the film makes it easier for a person who is not familiar with the history understand the events. The events are also in line with historical accounts Prophet Muhammad's life. The pictorial absence of Muhammad does not take away much from the story. This film is a must for anybody!",

            "content": "Cinematically, it was pretty good. Clearly a lot of work went into the sets, costumes & locations. While the acting was adequate, I have to disagree with other reviews in that I did not think it was Anthony Quinn's greatest work. Maybe because I viewed it through the lens of Christianity or maybe it was the way the actors talked to the camera when addressing Mohammed (i.e., it is against Islam to show the likeness of Mohammed - sort of a parallel to Jews never wring the word God - they spell it G-d), the movie had an odd \"vibe\" about it. The story itself is difficult to follow, much like the Koran itself. Though downplayed in the movie, early messages from God conflicted with later messages. It also plays up the 'peaceful' side of Islam, (but there again the movie has some fantastic battle scenes, if you overlook the overly fake looking blood) which stands in stark contrast to the evidence we see on the nightly news. Ideally, every Muslim would embrace the teachings of this movie and renounce the more radical teachings - not just the modern day \"terrorist\" mindset, but the way the early Muslims treated women in the early years seems to be quite different than today. I can't think of a Christian equivalent of this movie, as most movies about early Christianity only tell a small portion of the story. This movie attempts to explain the roots of Islam from when Mohammed began hearing from God at age 40, in about 610 AD to the full establishment of Islam around the world. It does to a reasonably good job for the early parts of Islam, but I kind of got lost in all the who's fighting who scenes. It was apparently all historically verified at the time of its making by Islamic scholars,which is explained at the beginning and end of the movie, which only adds to the eerie feeling the movie being less documentary and more propagandist. So, in short, the cinematic presentation is quite good, but the story is hard to follow and I felt it had a propagandist \"vibe\" throughout the movie. If you have 3 hours to kill and are interested in the subject matter, you'll likely enjoy it. For me I got restless in the middle when I started to get confused about who is battling who and for what reason.",

Its trying to project an idea, value system, principle, ethic...When the Prophet Muhammads (Peace Be Upon Him) message is seen as finding action through his followers, a powerful message is indeed being made about his personality and the overall nature of Islaam. Its true that Muslims have certain ideas about his image and voice being projected and what causes shirk .. BUT the truth of the message is witnessed in the transformation of the people the message touches. Islaam is fundamentally for people and is ultimately about the enlightenment of people.Anybody who understands this messages impact on people wont be able to say that Islaam needs to be transformed to include secular humanistic and democratic principles.The Prophet (PBUH) can't be seen to be the divine message but only be considered as integral to relate the divine message itself. Confusion would be created because the lines can blur so much between the divinity of the message and the divine impact on the Prophet (PBUH). Why would we make fixed assertions about the Prophet (PBUH) when it is the message of the religion that is visibly transformational and dynamic in society around him? The reality of Islams impact on people would then be ignored in favour of a personality cult interpretation of the actual events .. which is false. The movie is truer this way to historical and spiritual truths. He would become a napoleon/lincoln/gandhi for western consumption and this is romantic indulgence.Muslim orthodoxy have drawn very fixed lines which are debatable (yes they are) but there's so much between these lines that are of much more significance.",

As a Muslim i am jealous about my religion and i can't accept a single bad word about it.God ordered us to argue with the people of Book(Christians and Jews)with logic and good advice.Islam never considered Christians and Jews as a second class people, Islam gave them the religious freedom means they are free to convert to Islam or not,those who don't convert to Islam have to pay the gizya which was small tax compared to the zakah which was paid by Muslims themselves every year,they paid this tax in order to be protected by the Islamic army because they will not join an army to defend a religion which is not theirs!!,unless they really want to join the Islamic army ,that will be their choice.Even prophet Muhammad told his army when they enter any city : not to kill a woman ,a child , an old man,never to destroy any church, leave the people of this city free to have their own religion.Even when the Islamic army entered Egypt and Jerusalem or any other country, they treated the priests there with a very honorable treatment, never force them to convert into Islam.Islam considered all the people whether Muslim,Christian or Jews at the same level they are all equal in rights and duties. when Muhammad entered Al-Medina (which means the city in Arabic),he found there the Jews ,he made treaty with them:to free in their religion and to protect the city together against any enemy ,he didn't make them stand as one line and chop their heads that is not correct.and at last for the rights of both men and women,yes they have the same rights as in education,being equal in duties and rights ,both can Inherit (as before Muhammad woman can't inherit and was considered a bad omen) But Islam gave the woman her dignity and all her rights.but also Islam considered the man as the breadwinner of the family so he takes a higher share than the woman in heritage, but also he is responsible for serving her and get here all her needs ,Islam also put the steps to make the husband and his wife living a very lovely life together.i hope i have corrected all your incorrect ideas about Islam and please if u r interested in Islam read more about and have a good understanding of Koran verses not only take a piece of it and say that is the Islam,understand the whole verse please and if u want a good beginning i recommend this: HTTP://www.inspiredbymuhammed.com/ please feel comfortable to contact me for any about Islam and i shall do my best to help u Al Salam Alikom (peace be upon u)",

            "review_title": "Review on the film \"The Message\"",
            "content": "\"The Message\" is a film that was directed by a Syrian American film producer, Moustapha Akkad, and released in 1976. It is about the history of the emergence of Islam and the life of the Prophet Muhammad. Even though \"The Message\" lasts for approximately 3 hours, which, in comparison to other average films, may seem quite long, I do not doubt that its viewers will watch it in one breath. Because it illustrates the emergence of Islam and its dissemination by portraying the history with interesting and intriguing plots and stories that happened in the life of the Prophet Muhammad. I think that the film was completely able to recreate the atmosphere of how Islam destroyed the old traditions of the Arabs and brought new laws that stopped the practice of slavery, social inequality, and discrimination against women.The new religion brought freedom to slaves and treated all people equally, considering equal rights for everyone (social equality). Before the religion of Islam was first emerged, namely, in 610 CE, the situation in Mecca and Arab Peninsula, in general, was not in the best condition. There was an era of the strong and the rich who massively practiced slavery that abolished human rights. If we look into the historical terms, we can find that this period is called \"Jahiliyyah\", translated as the \"Age of Ignorance\", in which the slavery system reigned and ignored human rights. For example, from Moustapha Akkad's film \"The Message\" it can be seen how authorities of Mecca, the Quraysh, used to walk with their slaves that held large palm leaves in their hands to protect them from the hot rays of the Sun. One of these rich merchants was Umayyah Ibn Khalaf who had a servant Bilal, who later was freed from slavery and became one of the companions, Sahabah, of the Prophet Muhammad. Later, the Bilal Sahabah became the first mu'azzin (caller to the prayer) since he had a very beautiful and outstanding voice. The film depicts another influential and authoritative people from the Quraysh tribe like Abu Sufyan and Abu Huzaifa who also widely practiced slavery since having slaves gave them a lot of authority and power in front of other Arabs. Abu Huzaifa had a slave Sumayyah, a woman who later accepted Islam and followed the \"true path\" guided by God through the Prophet Muhammad who was a servant and the messenger of God. She was a mother of the Sahabah Ammar and amongst early Muslims who died on the path of defending the religion and became \"Shaheed\" (a person who sacrificed himself in the way of religion and died in agony). People who later converted to Islam and joined the \"umma\" (community) of Muhammad never faced any social inequality issues, in which the rich were allowed more than the poor and the rich neglected the poor as it was in pre-Islamic times. The scene from the film \"The Message\", where the conversation between King Najashi and Muslim emigrants takes place, can be good proof of that. Nobody respected anyone just because of their social status since the religion of the Prophet has taught that everyone is equal before God. This can also be seen from the work of Ibn Ishaq, \"The Life of Muhammad\", when the Prophet Muhammad in his \"Night Journey\" was given a five times prayer a day (p. 186-187) and it applies to all other Believers, regardless their social status. Otherwise, I think it could be the case where the strong and the rich would be ordered less praying or vice versa. However, this did not happen and, thus, Muslims do the same mandatory 5 times prayer a day. So, the film depicts that with the advent of Islam and the Prophet Muhammad the old tradition of slavery came to an end, and slaves began to have their freedom, and equal rights were distributed among people.Also, the religion of the Prophet Muhammad returned the importance of women and elevated their rights that were discriminated against during the Jahiliyyah period. This can be shown in the movie when in the early morning the young Sahabah of the Prophet Muhammad, Ammar, enters his home and meets his parents that have been waiting for the whole night. Then, they asked Ammar whether he went to Muhammad, who in that time could teach the religion only at nights when the Quraysh were sleeping. When the mother of Ammar, Sumayyah, was informed that he went to the Prophet to learn Islam, she was upset. However, when the Ammar Sahabah explained that Muhammad came with revelations sent from God and teaches people to treat everyone equally and not to discriminate against women, she gladly agreed to accept Islam. While listening to her speech we can notice that her father killed two of her sisters but could not do it with Sumayyah because her father was not able to stand such suffering again. It shows that in the period of Jahiliyyah, Arabs were continuously killing their newborn daughters simply because they were not a boy. However, Islam prohibited people from discrimination against women, and instead commanded them to love and protect women. We can see it from the scene of the film \"The Message\" where King Najashi listened to the group of Muslim emigrants who were introducing and explaining the religion of Islam. Also, according to Ibn Ishaq, \"by Hadija (wife of Muhammad) God lightened the burden of His prophet\" (p. 155). She supported her husband Muhammad at hard times, and the Prophet could rely on her. This shows the importance of women and their support in Islam. Therefore, the film shows that women, who earlier were discriminated against, have played an important role and found greater support in the new religion.Moustapha Akkad's \"The Message\" was completely able to recreate and convey the atmosphere of how Islam introduced his new laws that destroyed the previous traditions, in which slavery, social inequality, and discrimination against women were widely practiced. The quality of the film is very good considering the fact that it was filmed in the 70s. I cannot have any complaints about the lighting and sound of the film. I would like to point out that the music was chosen in such a way that it gives special energy and atmosphere to the film, especially during the bloody wars when the music becomes more intense. The clothing and jewelry of actors, Islamic architecture, the trading processes in open markets, belly dance of Arabic girls to the Arabic songs make the atmosphere even better. Thanks to the film, I was able to learn more about the life of the Prophet and the difficulties that he and his followers faced while spreading Islam. Thanks to the highly qualified actors, who could avoid false feelings, I could see how women were discriminated against and slaves were tortured by the leaders of the Quraysh in reality. I highly recommend watching this film for those who are interested in Islam and want to know more about the life of the Prophet Muhammad. However, I do not recommend for the faint-hearted because it contains torture, blood, and war.",

I mean people like Bush, Saddam Husssein and Osama Bin Laden. I don't know if you understand what i tried to explain, but i believe it's true. I mean just because some fanatics have the power in this world, then it is not like they show the world by killing innocent people. I am a Muslim myself, and 15 years old, but I believe it's like that. So \u00cd don't think you can blame others because of some idiots says that Jews or Christian's have no right to live, then you can't blame it on other Muslim's too.",

If you think that something is wrong about your life, u can find the solution like Matrix. :) Because if u can watch the film truly, u will recognize that this world is a lie, so what is right? Be sure that \"The Message\" included these rights. And u can walk in the World like Matrix (film). Whole faults, errors, wrong in the world because of the laws that write with people, and can pass with writing without human. So think that if you have applied all thinks in this film, u can be unhappy? Not, because film represent not telling lie, helping to the poor, neighbors, pray for your Creator (Allah) ... vs. So take a tea and have a good watching :) R.K.",
