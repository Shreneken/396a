            "content": "Poor John Boorman. He has all these great ideas, but whenever he tries to put them to the screen, the result is so damn goofy you can't tell whether you're watching a metaphysical drama or a slapstick comedy (for more on this, see \"Zardoz\"). His \"Exorcist\" sequel is miles below the original if you're looking for scares, but miles above it in terms of actual storytelling, plot, character development, etc. It's full of interesting ideas (the most interesting being the idea of pure goodness as a magnet for evil), and Regan turns into an angelic heroine out to stop the demon that once possessed her. But Boorman's wacko imagery, while fascinating in places (the doves, the locusts), tends to get a little TOO wacko, to the point where you can't help laughing (the hypnosis machine, Richard Burton putting out a fire with a wooden crutch, James Earl Jones spitting up a tomato).If you can accept the fact that this is a completely different movie than the original, you might find that it's a pretty good movie on its own. Fantastic acting from Burton, a wonderful score, and some truly gorgeous visuals, especially the climactic scene in the house, make it one of the most underrated movies of all time. Even if some scenes leave you falling over with laughter.",

            "content": "Four years has passed... Regan MacNeil (Linda Blair) was possessed by an demon. There was an exorcism performed by Father Merrin (Max Von Sydow) and Father Karras (The late Jason Miller). Father Lamont (The late Richard Burton) lost his faith, after an failed exorcism. The Cardinal (The late Paul Henreid) is asking Father Lamont to investigated on the late Father Merrin on heresy charges due on his controversial writings. He decided to meet Regan, now is Seventeen years old. Regan is living with her guardian Sharon (Kitty Winn) and Regan is seeing an hypnotic research specialist (Oscar-Winner:Louise Fletcher). Father Lamont is trying to find out, what truly happened to Father Merrin but he slowly discovers that the Demon, who possessed Regan hasn't truly left her body. He uncovers more of Father Merrin's past, when he did his first exorcism in Africa on a little boy. He decides to meet the former possessed soul (James Earl Jones) and try to find out, if Father Merrin made any mistakes in his past. While Regan is slowly remembering her dark past.Directed by John Boorman (Deliverance, Excalibur, Zardoz) made an strange, messy, horror film with some (unfortunely) unintentional laughs. Blair does her best, she looks cute in most of the movie but she isn't an leading actress. The late Burton looks foolish at times with his unintentionally bad dialogue. Only Fletcher gives an memorable performance as an sympathetic doctor. This was an major box office disappointment, it was released in 1977. Which Boorman tried to re-cut the picture but it didn't help.DVD has an fine anamorphic Widescreen (1.78:1) transfer and an decent Dolby Digital 1.0 Mono Sound. DVD includes an Alternate Opening Sequence, an Teaser Trailer, Original Theatrical Trailer and Cast & Crew information. \"The Exorcist 2:The Heretic\" is a wild mess, it makes you wonder what Boorman and Screenwriter:William Goodhart original intentions were. Although this movie does an cult following. The biggest fan of \"The Exorcist 2:The Heretic\" is actually Oscar-Winning filmmaker:Martin Scorsese! This movie is best enjoyed with an open mind. The special effects does brings this movie to life at times but it is overdone by seeing Locusts on-screen, large or small. Which the feature looks pointless at times. (*** \u00bd/*****).",

            "content": "I liked this when it came out and I still do. The bad press on it began immediately, and all the reviewers jumped on the bandwagon; only one of the reviews seemed to correlate with what showed on the screen. I think the time was wrong for mysticism, and maybe for religion: the sixties had ended, and the mode of fantasy then in favor was space fantasy, full of technical detail. A couple of decades later, the climate is different: \"Stigmata\", which has a story not unlike that of \"Exorcist II,\" and looks and feels so much like it that it might almost be the same film with different actors morphed in, didn't get good reviews but wasn't laughed out of theatres either. Most of the people who like \"Exorcist II\" tend not to have liked \"Exorcist I\" much, and vice versa. Blatty himself said in one interview that it didn't work because the director was a Protestant, and in another interview that it was because he wasn't a believer. To me the second film shows more spiritual feeling than the first, but no interest at all in the Church, and maybe in some minds that equates to unreligiousness. The first \"Exorcist\" purported to be about possession, but most of its imagery was of a young girl being raped: by her mother's party guests, by doctors, by priests, by a crucifix. \"Exorcist II\" actually is about possession, among other things, and culminates in the interesting idea (excised after release but later restored on video and DVD) that people who have been possessed and purged of evil can go forth to heal all the others who are similarly afflicted. I happen to think that's an inspiring idea for a story. But then I like mystical thrillers, and apparently most filmgoers don't--or didn't then. The first \"Exorcist\" was not one; this is. The images in the first film, when they don't involve repulsive bodily detail, have no metaphysical resonance; they're relentlessly physical, often sexual, and when the demon itself appears, it's in the form of the actual, literal statue. By contrast the images in \"Exorcist II\" have deliberate metaphysical implications. I doubt that they were worked out thoroughly; it's more as if Boorman were playing with them, in the same way he lets the light play through the stylized sets and behind the actors. The scenes of possession capture the sense of historical accounts of the phenomenon more than those in the first film, which is too much distracted by physical threat and sexual aberration.Like \"Exorcist II\" or no, take it seriously or no, I was and am puzzled why more people were unable to enjoy its appeal to the eye and the ear (the music was pretty too), let alone to the imagination. I think perhaps they couldn't allow themselves to enjoy it: that they had to deride it and be seen to deride it because what it said, or the way in which it was said, was something that they had just learned to reject or that contradicted something they had just learned to believe. It must be admitted that the film is unsatisfactory dramatically. The fantastic incidents of the first film, besides being reduced to the most prosaic physical terms, were fitted within a sequence of conventional, punchy, easily playable scenes; one cared about Ellen Burstyn's problems in a movieish way, and through her Linda Blair's. In the sequel Blair doesn't have the scenes to play, and her inexperience as an actress keeps one from feeling involved with her; Burton is better, but his dialogue doesn't communicate the spiritual dilemma he's undergoing. The excitements of the narrative tend rather to distract from this also. But I found them fun in their own right, and the film as well, apart from the occasional gratuitous shock for shock's sake: fun for the mind and the fancy.",

I AM glad they made it and being a fan of the first I found it to be just as excellent a sequel as I could have hoped for.**** spoiler **** The introduction to the movie provides an amazing concept of how evil regenerates or generates itself and later it covers how its built on the collective psych of the masses.

            "content": "I don't think anyone knew what hit them when The Exorcist was released in the theaters in 1973. Still to this day it remains one of the most terrifying movies of all time and is also incredibly popular. But when it was released, I'm sure a lot of people were a little curious what would happen to Chris and Regan after the exorcism and what really did happen to Father Merrin in that bedroom. However some questions are better left unanswered because we got a lot of the answers in Exorcist 2: The Herotic, one of the weirdest movies ever released. Also when I say answers, I mean the garbled up, taken by aliens, experimented on, thrown back up by the aliens onto Earth mixed in with some acid and put onto the silver screen where it was booed out of theaters. It was immediately removed and edited like crazy and still there was no way the audience was going to ever give this film a chance.Lamont is assigned by the Cardinal to investigate the death of Father Merrin, who had been killed four years prior in the course of exorcising the demon Pazuzu from Regan MacNeil. Regan, although now seemingly normal and staying with guardian Sharon Spencer in New York, continues to be monitored at a psychiatric institute by Dr. Gene Tuskin. Regan claims she remembers nothing about her plight in Washington, D.C., but Tuskin believes her memories are only buried or repressed. Father Lamont visits the institute but his attempts to question Regan about the circumstances of Father Merrin's death are rebuffed by Dr. Tuskin. In an attempt to plumb her memories of the exorcism, specifically the circumstances in which Merrin died, Dr. Tuskin hypnotizes the girl, to whom she is linked by a \"synchronizer\", a biofeedback device used by two people to synchronize their brainwaves. We see what really happened to Merrin and the times that he did face the demon prior to Regan.Exorcist 2 certainly is a bad movie, however, I must give some credit as it's a really interesting story. It's just made with the wrong people and was directed by a man who hated the first film. I think that's why it's a bad movie in some sense, it seemed to disrespect the original. Also them repeating the demon's name \"Pazuzu\" was just annoying and makes the demon sound less frightening. One of the things I loved about the original is that the demon that possessed Regan was kept a secret and left up to interpretation, she says she's the devil but Kerris brings up the point where that's like saying you're Napoleon Bonaparte. Then Merrin brought up that the demon is a liar, so we could deny that she's the devil himself. But giving the name Pazuzu just didn't work, well at least when you say it more than a dozen times. James Earl Jones and the locust costume was just way too funny and the funny thing is this movie was released the same year as Star Wars, wouldn't it be hilarious if he got off the set and went to do the voice work as Darth Vader in that costume?! Exorcist 2 is not the worst movie of all time, it had tremendous potential with the story, but due to the people that were working on it, it just was doomed to not hold a candle to the original. I would say that this movie is a skip, if you want to see this movie I recommend just taking acid and watching the first film.3/10",

            "content": "Grossly underrated, Exorcist II is one of John Boorman's finest films.Rather than go for the spinning heads and pea soup that were featured in the first film, Boorman opted to go in a less horrific and more surreal and dramatic direction. Most people claim that sequels shouldn't be a rehash of the original, well this certainly wasn't!The acting was quite good here. The cinematography as in most every Boorman movie, is exquisite. The score by Ennio Morriconne is terrific and sets a slightly different tone from the first film. Overall, the film has a much broader feel to it, I think because the film takes place at many places rather than confined to the room of the first film. Also, there are some elaborate special effects scenes that are breathtaking. Everyone of them quite chilling.This isn't really what I would call an actual horror film. It's a drama involving the supernatural. I'm not sure exactly what I'd classify this as. It's a genre all it's own almost.See it with an open mind. Forget what people have said in the past.You just might be surprised.",

            "review_title": "Mind-blowing nod to the Italian horror genre...",
            "content": "Director John Boorman bravely takes his film \"Exorcist II: The Heretic\" in a dramatically different direction from it's successful predecessor. A teenage Regan is ready to deal with her memories of her terrifying demonic possession at age 12. All that can be said after viewing this spectacle is that Boorman was hugely influenced by the Italian horror masters, Argento, Bava, Lucio Fulci, etc. The overwrought drama, the astoundingly bizarre, hallucinogenic imagery, the intentionally artificial-looking, but mind blowing sets; He even employed Ennio Morricone to create the atmospheric, and beautiful score, a score that accompanies the images on screen in an unforgettable way. \"The Heretic\" bears so many similarities to films like \"Suspiria\" and \"Lisa & the Devil\" that it is ridiculous that more people don't notice this. One of many examples; the final scene where Regan and Father Lamont turn and walk into the trippy, ghostly horizon, filmed from a wide shot, is virtually identical to the final scene of \"The Beyond,\" Lucio Fulci's bizarre and surreal cult shocker. \"The Beyond was released in 1981, four years after \"The Heretic,\" so it seems that at least one cult Italian director was quite impressed with this one. If you have seen an Italian \"giallo\" than you can imagine the look of 'Heretic.' And just like in the great giallo's, the acting is over-dramatic, the lines uttered by the characters are sometimes silly, weird, or just plain indecipherable. The story is totally unbelievable while at the same time the ideas get inside your head and make you think, and wonder. Boorman has always been a visionary, and he does not disappoint with the look and dreamlike feel of \"Heretic.' Linda Blair plays her part with an enchanting innocence, and Richard Burton, reportedly drunk through most of the filming, delivers his lines with as much passion and drama as if he were doing Shakespeare. The gaudy, colorful re-creation of the African landscape is a centerpiece of this film, and POV scenes of the locusts flying overhead give the audience the feeling that we are indeed flying, and traveling to mysterious lands, or even other worlds, as Africa resembles the planet Mars in some shots! This is the most European-style American film i have seen, and i have to wonder how this film was received overseas. If you are looking for gratuitous vomit and head-spinning scenes, you won't find it here. Instead you will be treated to a more mystical, and even spiritual experience. Opinions on \"Exorcist II: The Heretic\" vary as much as this film does from it's predecessor. But one thing cannot be denied; there has rarely been a film with the overwhelming look and atmosphere of this bizarre cult film. For those in doubt, I recommend taking the opinion of one of the Greatest filmmakers of all time; Martin Scorsese, over those of the many \"armchair critics\" that have flooded this site with ridiculous and shallow insults about this movie...Scorsese loves \"Exorcist II: The Heretic..\" and I absolutely agree with \"the Master...\"",

            "content": "The excellent and competent film maker John Boorman had the hard responsibility to make a sequence which should have the same (or superior) quality of the first film, and even not achieving to give us a memorable work, he deserves to be applauded by having made a touching, although a bit slow in some moments, thriller. \"The Exorcist 2\" is a truly super production, with the best special effects the money could buy at the time (1977), and  we notice that in each technical aspect: the cinematography, the photography and the sound track give the notion of the movie's magnitude, but even so the result didn't get to supplant the quality of the first of the series initiated by William Friedkin. Who is more talented, Friedkin or Boorman?hard to say, but lets remember that Friedkin made the first one with little money. Famous terror films generally generate sequences, and sometimes, the sequences overcome the original, it is more than enough to remind of the \"Hellraiser\" case , that, in 1988, had a better, more violent and cruel continuation, called \"Hellbound: Hellraiser 2\" (and, as \"The Exorcist\", the film was conducted by a new director, in this case, Tony Randel, who replaced Clive barker). In spite of great part of the \"Hellbound Hellraiser 2\" success derive of the fact of the memorable performances,such as the  ones of the English actress Clare Higgins (playing perverse J\u00falia) and William Hope (as the young and brilliant dr. Kyle MacRae), the film, as well as \"The Exorcist 2\", overflows a rich and breath taking visual, but the script  helped a lot. In the case of \"The Exorcist 2\",the plot  didn't have the same psychological study and the character's depth of \"Hellbound: Hellraiser 2\" but  a confused and undecided story.The great John Boorman should receive a medal: he really made everything that he could to offer a good show. The performances, excellent, come from Richard Burton, Linda Blair and Louise Fletcher. Ned Beatty is also in the film, interpreting an entertaining pilot. Beatty, an excellent actor in any role, works for the second time with Boorman, they made \"Deliverance\" together. Don't make a mistake, because \"The Exorcist 2\" is not the terrible film that the people comment, but a confused continuation, without defined objective, of one of the greatest  Hollywood's successes ,but even so, the work of Boorman deserves to be seen, for its brilliant performances and for some good frights!!",

One of the most obvious is its complete cheesiness as everything in here is mistakenly bad, but it's still a fun watch. It's fun to see how everything comes together, not only with the returning characters but the idea of having the spirit as well is a novel idea and much fun can be had from seeing just how it goes through events. The idea of the hypnosis machine triggering the different visions of the demon's previous encounters throughout history that gives this plenty to like in the first half. It's got a silly quality which the original didn't have in that everything in here is so over-the-top with the revelations showing the fighter braving the various terrains or fighting off the deadly swarm of locusts ravaging their camp which is absolutely reveling in cheese that few films have. It's great to see how this plays out, and really sets up the finale that really has a great impact to it being a huge action set-piece. This is the high point of the film involving the battle to get home and the battle inside the house that leaves the entire place in ruins with all the different tricks and tactics employed throughout here to get the upper hand. There are several things about this that didn't really work. The main issue is that the film really goes on far longer than it should and contains a lot of useless moments. The Africa scenes are twice as long as they should be, the sequences in the hospital are equally overlong and in general, there are scenes in here that are there for pretty much no real reason. That just makes it more hopeful when something will happen, only for more dialog to take place. The other main issue here is the complete disregard for comprehension in here. It makes no sense at all and has a feeling that it enjoys being that way. Going through everything in here that makes no sense at all is a task that's far too hard to try to explain and get out of the way, and it feels like that's what the feel was going in, as there's no way that something this incomprehensive was by fault. Some of it can make a headache causing time, the wrong feeling when trying to explain something that was really hard to understand the first time around. These are the main things wrong with it, but they do count for a lot.Rated R: Violence, Language and Brief Nudity.",

Yes, that's more or less what it feels like.  There are some good things here nevertheless.  I have a feeling critics would have been much kinder to Exorcist II if it had been released today: would-be blockbusters, and horror movies, have gotten so much worse as to reveal virtues that few would have noticed in 1977.Such as...?  Sheer, dark stylishness, for one thing.  No horror film would be so well shot, or visually convey such seriousness of purpose, today. Richard Burton (and he's not the only one) delivers some laughable lines, to be sure; yet he and his surroundings are filmed with such sobriety that we don't laugh as much as we might - if at all.  A common complaint made of a ridiculous film is that it takes itself too seriously.  This charge is usually misguided.  What's wrong with (say) \"Battlefield Earth\" is that it tries AND FAILS to take itself seriously.  Much in Exorcist II, mostly the dialogue, is downright ludicrous, yet the film is redeemed by how seriously it succeeds in taking itself.Other good things... Those shots of Africa, shot within a studio and all the better for it, are both beautiful and seriously creepy.  The musical score is a fine one (one of Morricone's best).  Then there's Linda Blair.  It was a marvellous stroke of good luck that the 13-year-old actress they chose to play the part of an even younger girl in \"The Exorcist\" would grow up to be so gorgeous.",

            "content": "Looking back it is easy to see that the making of this film was not a good time for the main protagonists. Director John Boorman must have still been reeling from the less than enthusiastic reception of Zardoz (1975), a real letdown after the box office success and critical acclaim for Deliverence (1972). Linda Blair, the plucky young teen from the original film had noticeably matured but was rumoured to have been into substance abuse and prone to extremely late arrivals on set whilst her co-star had problems of his own. Richard Burton, always a bit of a drinker, was reputedly drunk most of the time and clearly unhappy. Indeed it is suggested he had only taken the role (without reading the script?) in order to be assured of the part in Equus the same year. And what a difference a film makes. Acting by numbers here for Boorman, he is not helped by a director who was severely under the cosh with sustained opposition from Blatty and Co to even make the film. Opposition that even restricted the use of original locations necessitating almost everything to be made on set. So, not only are the leading couple less than happy but the very circumstances of shooting handicapped. It is a wonder the thing got made at all but no surprise that the over extended pretend Africa scenes are so poor or that the extended use of the ridiculous supposed hypnosis syncroniser made to take up so much of the footage. Probably only a couple of pluses here, one that Burton was brilliant in his other film that year and the Morricone score was well up to his usual standard.",

The icing on the cake is Richard Burton, who reaches desperately for dignified seriousness in every single scene. His gravitas inevitably collides with the sheer stupidity of the script in a big hysterical mess. Man, I don't know who wrote this, but\u0085 what were they thinking? Did the scriptwriter hit his head prior to this? How could a well-respected actor like Richard Burton, a Shakespearean heavyweight, participate in this? Nothing can prepare you for the incredibly dumb dialogues, those \"edgy\" special effects and fake African sets, the wrath of Pazuzu and - oh, my God - Linda Blair's acting. \"Exorcist 2\" is a hilarious epic fail and I can't recommend it enough to all those who enjoy campy, unintentionally funny flicks. The others probably won't have the patience or the sense of humor to appreciate it. Burton's performance makes this an exquisite example of \"so bad it's good\".Here's a tip: watch it with the completely insane \"Zardoz\" (Sean Connery walking around in red diapers!) for a Boorman double feature with Extra Cheese.",

            "content": "I don't consider the original Exorcist to be \"scary\", but I do like it thanks to the terse editing and restrained direction. Though I've never really warmed to John Boorman I did find Exorcist II to be his most interesting film.As a sequel it's thematically detached from the first and creates it's own new mythology and imagery. The events from Exorcist are referenced extensively and Regan, now 17, has multiple flashbacks to her bedroom. Father Lamont, a rogue priest played by Richard Burton, investigates the case in an effort to find out what really happened to Father Merrin by involving himself in Regan's therapy sessions. A muddled plot about curbing the spread of evil and the divinity of our teenage heroine fills up the rest of the film with regular cutaways to Africa where Lamont researches the recent history of Pazuzu (not the Devil, as most believe).Nothing, repeat NOTHING in this film is even remotely intelligible. Towards the end there are dozens of unexplained elements. On top that there is some hilariously stupid dialogue. How did some of this stuff get approval? I would flat out refuse to say \"Oh, I was possessed by a demon. But it's okay, he's gone now,\" upon meeting a new friend. When the credits finally roll you'll be scratching your head, unable to make head nor tail of what you've just witnessed.What it does have going for it however is absolutely stunning photography. Only a few 70s set designs date this film aesthetically. The shots of African sunsets and the rock churches are amazing and the general dark, silhouetted appearance of the dialogue scenes create a wonderful, moody atmosphere.It's a shame that Linda Blair's career collapsed after this. After getting involved in several bad relationships her acting career went down the toilet and she's never starred in anything as up-market as this ever since. She's such a cutie in Exorcist II and, as a bonus, hardly ever wears a bra.As a sequel to a classic it's a bit of a let down, but as a stand-alone weirdo melodrama it's nothing if not interesting. Do check it out, but keep in mind everything I just said.",

Perhaps this is why so few viewers find this film initially rewarding. It is much less a sequel than a whole new rethinking of the original source material. Reagan becomes a kind of new age heroine and Boorman (surprisingly) turns the misogyny and mean spiritedness of the original film into an emotionally passionate look at this young woman as a survivor of real spiritual and emotional trauma. The film has some hard amazingly passionate performances from Louise Fletcher, Richard Burton and Linda Blair. Although, it has to be admitted that the script has some of the most pretentious dialog imaginable, Boorman is remarkably able to make most of the text seem plausible. A classic of its kind.",

            "content": "Starting from what would usually be the end of a review, I'm giving this film 9/10. The reason? Because it is hilariously awful. I love a bad sequel, and this is the ultimate in bad sequels. Still, nothing was really ever going to be able to top the original Exorcist film.The Heretic isn't so much a movie, as a collection of random scenes and dialogue that neither make much sense or move the story on in any logical direction.The early scenes in Dr Tuskin's office are just bizarre, and surely if you're visiting a psychiatrist you'd want to be consulted privately? Not so in Regan's case - she gets to be consulted in what appears to be a collection of telephone boxes with an assortment of 70s brown furniture and some special needs children about the place. Linda Blair seems to have lost all the acting ability she had in the first film and delivers her lines as though she was making elevator floor announcements.Richard Burton, no words can describe his 'acting' 'style' in this film. You just have to sit and watch. No piece of scenery gets away without some of his teeth marks in it. My favourite Richard Burton moments do happen in Dr Tuskin's office. His reaction, or lack of it when he's connected to Regan's mind using the flashing-box-memory-swapper- thing/strobe light is something to behold. And you will get to behold it because the camera pans to his lack of reaction a lot.Moving on, other scenes include flying locusts - there are a LOT of flying locusts in this film. There's also a lot of 'African' landscape. Or, African landscape recreated badly on a Warner Bros sound stage... For some reason the sky is also permanently yellow in this 'Africa' we get to see. Along with 'Africa', we also get to see the Georgetown house from the original movie, but again not actually on location, but recreated on a Warner Bros sound stage. Some of the scenes in the 'Georgetown' house do actually make a bit of sense. Unfortunately all sense soon goes out of the window once Linda Blair starts trying to be all sexy in lingerie whilst apparently possessed again. Only this time the possession doesn't come with injuries and disfigurements all over Regan's body, it comes with a vaguely-evil-but-not-that-evil cartoon-demonic voice.Sharon, Chris Macneil's live-in assistant from the first movie is back, but rather than being the young, likable, and concerned woman she was, she seems to have become some weird nun-like character who does very little except look concerned and come to an abrupt end that again doesn't make much sense.I have purposely made my review slightly mixed up and confusing, because the film itself is like this. I've sat through it a few of times, usually laughing/cringing at the Razzie-worthy performances of all the cast and the hilarious dialogue they deliver, and even after several viewings I really have no idea what actually happens. Everything moves at a really uneven pace - either really slowly, or blink-and-you-miss-it quickly. If you've ever seen the trailer for this film, yes the one with the 'Disco' soundtrack then you've already seen the best bits of the film, and would probably have as much idea about the plot of the full movie as I do now.To sum up - what was that all about?!",

It makes you wonder, as any boob with as big a budget as this film could have made a good film and had no right to make one this bad!!The film picks up several years after the last one. Most of the original cast are gone but Regan (Linda Blair) is back. Now she's a seemingly well-adjusted and shapely young lady who loves working with disabled kids(!). An annoying psychiatrist (Louise Fletcher) works with Regan and assumes that all the publicity about her possession can easily be explained away using science. At the same time, a totally nutty priest (overplayed badly by Richard Burton) investigates the case and is certain possession did occur--and wants to be certain that Blair is not repossessed! Where this goes next is pretty dumb...no, it's INCREDIBLY dumb. It turns out that there is some sort of African demon named Pazuzu (or something like it) and the film just gets dumber and dumber. Badly made scenes involving the demon and locust swarms look amazingly silly and the plot goes very, very, very far from the original film--a bizarre choice, that's for sure! But if that isn't enough, there is an ear-piercing shrill sound that simply made me want to gouge my eardrums out to make it stop! At this point, I was ready to scream....and it never got any better! Too many dumb and annoying scenes and an African tie-in that made no sense--why did the script go this way?! The film is the trifecta of badness--horribly written, directed by a chimp and badly acted. An annoying and dumb film from start to finish and this is saying a lot considering that it was re-edited several times to even get it to this level of badness!",

It's a real visual treat with brilliant photography. The dreamlike scenes in the Africa background and wonderfully made, one of the best parts of film. Another great scene are the locusts flying over Georgetown at midnight. The music by Ennio Morricone ranks among one of his best works and is such a beautiful, haunting trip that is much superior to the score of the original film. The acting however, isn't such a highlight. Richard Burton is, surprisingly terrible in the part of Father Lamont, the follower of Father Merrin (Max Von Sydow), who died mysteriously during the exorcism of young Regan McNeil (Linda Blair, who tries her best to cover up Burton's mess). Max Von Sydow also returns to this film, and gives a mesmerizing performance,though he appears in the dreams sequences in Africa and the flashbacks of the exorcism in Washington. Linda Blair returns, and is quite a vision, as a teenager Regan who's an aspirant dancer. This film also has a very futuristic feel, with it's sci-fi elements and bizarre, surrealistic set desing, some of the highlights include Regan's Manhattan panthouse, the labyrinth, hellish African village and the children hospital run by Dr. Gene Tuskin (Louise Fletcher).As I've said before, Burton did a pretty bad job and it's quite disappointing to see an actor of his caliber to do such a mess, which I believe to be one of the points that made it such a flop. Another is that The Heretic takes on a entirely different route than the first film, therefore, audiences were disappointed. The ending is very bad as well, unfortunately. But, don't let this let you down, THE HERETIC has a lot to offer and plenty of scares (though different from the first film). I give it 8 stars out of 10.",

I wasn't going into it with the intention of hating it, I just thought it would be horrible, and surprise, surprise, it turned out to be a really great experience.\"The Exorcist II: The Heretic\" doesn't have much in common with the original film, but looking at it as its own thing, as its own story, I must say that it manages to be really entertaining and captivating. Some people find it to be incoherent, silly and nonsensical, and it kinda of is, I can see how people wouldn't like it, but hating it like people hate it now? is just inconceivable to me.Its not a film that you are meant to be scare of, its a film that will take you in a surreal experience, its one of the closest things I have seen on film that resembles a dream. It doesn't stray away from the plot enough to be compared to something like \"Eraserhead\" and its not as straightforward as the original was, the original was a great tale told in a very classy and frightening way. This movie falls somewhere in between those two and I believe it balances the surreal scenes well enough so that you care about whats happening on screen without them being distracting or too weird, but doesn't linger too much on the most mundane dialog scenes.I find the silly scenes to be quite fitting within the films mood and tone, I don't find them distracting or funny just mesmerizing. I would say that this is not a movie for everyone, not even for the most hardcore horror fans but I loved it.

            "content": "I think that the original \"Exorcist\" is, by far, one of the greatest movies ever made. It's the only movie that actually scares me and it's a magnificent piece of work, really. Except for the music (with the exception of \"Tubular Bells\"), I wouldn't change anything about it.Now comes this other movie, this *sequel* (hiss!) directed by the man who gave us \"Deliverance\". Linda Blair returns as Regan, and Kitty Winn as Sharon, along with Max von Sydow for some fill-in-the-blanks work, but they're the only prominent talents behind or in front of the cameras to return.How dare this movie pretend to be in the same league as \"The Exorcist,\" right? Wrong.Going in with absolutely no expectations whatsoever (I recommend that state of mind), I found a good story told in a not-particularly-good fashion. The acting is mostly awful, except some capable moments by Linda Blair and James Earl Jones. However, the actors deliver lines that weren't really meant for Hollywood-- metaphorical, psychospiritual stuff about locusts and the demon Pazuzu, who, four years prior, got all up in little Regan's grill and may be doing so again. This is, at its core, a fantasy, not a nightmare.Some scenes of the movie-- a ritual at a clifftop church in Africa and Father Lamont's meeting with Kokumo, just a couple examples-- are actually fascinating. John Boorman is a good director, mostly, and makes choices that are bewildering, but not as terrible as you've heard. The movie also distances itself from the original-- the patchwork, obnoxious soundtrack of the first is replaced by a single score by the legendary Ennio Morricone, and the visuals appeal less to claustrophobia. Some tracking shots in Africa are absolutely breathtaking, but then William Fraker, the cinematographer, has a long history of doing great, underrated work-- see also \"1941\" (1979) and \"Paint Your Wagon\" (1969).All in all, it's not a great movie. I can't say I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a carbon copy of Exorcist 1, but that's great. Honestly, I can guarantee it began as a moneymaking scheme by the studio to recapture the original's instant, intoxicating success. But another sequel to a religious-horror classic was like that, and it will never be acquitted-- \"Damien: Omen II,\" a disastrous joke of a movie. \"Exorcist II\" is acquitted.",

            "content": "Exorcist II: The Heretic (1977) * (out of 4) Extremely confused sequel takes place several years after the events in the first film. Regan (Linda Blair) has fully recovered from the events and appears to be living a normal life. A psychiatrist (Louise Fletcher) plans to prove via science that everything that happened to the young girl can be explained. While that is going on, the Catholic church has asked Father Lamont (Richard Burton) to find out what really happened to Father Merrin (Max von Sydow).EXORCIST II: THE HERETIC has been considered one of the worst movies ever made since it's first screening. The stories behind the opening day and weeks of this movie have become legendary and even though the movie made money for Warner, the studio was still highly embarrassed by it and the following decades haven't been kind to the picture. You really have to place blame at director John Boorman's feet because he's the one who agreed to the screenplay and according to all records, he's the one that kept out some pretty interesting ideas that they had for the film. In later interviews the director seemed to admit that he simply didn't deliver a film that people wanted to see.That's certainly an understatement because this thing is just a complete mess from the opening sequences to the incredibly awful finale. It's clear that Boorman didn't want to just copy the first film and for that you can respect him. With that said, a direct rip-off of the first film would have been much better than what we actually got. It's funny but there were countless rip-offs of THE EXORCIST that happened since the time that film was released and this sequel was released and what's sad is that the majority of them were better than this. The biggest problem, for me anyways, is that there's really nothing that happens throughout the two-hour running time. The film's pacing is so incredibly slow that by the forty-five minute mark I was already about to fall asleep.What follows doesn't get any better as we got the psychiatrist and the priest going at one another while Regan is curing sick children (really?). Then you've got Father Merrin working in Africa, which just adds up to nothing. Look, I realize this film has its defenders including Martin Scorsese, but for my money it's a complete waste of time. The finale is just downright stupid and appears to be trying to match the original film but there's no drama, no suspense and nothing memorable at all. Even worse is that the special effects really aren't that impressive nor is the music score.There are a few good things with the film including some of the performances. Blair does a good job in her role but sadly she really isn't given too much to do. Fletcher and von Sydow are both good in their supporting roles and Kitty Winn, James Earl Jones and Ned Beatty do what they can with the screenplay. However, Burton doesn't come off very good and at times he's quite laughable as he overplays everything and some of his line delivery makes you wonder how much he had to drink before filming. It's obvious this was just a paycheck to the actor and lets hope he enjoyed the money.EXORCIST II: THE HERETIC might not deserve its reputation of being one of the worst movies ever made but it certainly deserves to be called one of the dumbest. Again, I can respect the fact that Boorman didn't want to just deliver another possession film but I think most people would have preferred that over the mess we ended up getting.",

            "content": "William Peter Blatty, author of THE EXORCIST, based the character of Father Lankester Merrin on the Jesuit scholar Teilhard de Chardin. In books such as \"The Phenomenon of Man\", de Chardin theorized a metaphysical concept he called the World Mind, an interpretation of Christian mysticism which sees all minds as joined and gradually evolving into a full awareness of Being as a single consciousness akin to the New Thought idea of Christ Consciousness--the \"only begotten\" extension of Universal Consciousness, or God. This idea, a synthesis of Christian and Asian religious concepts, is resonant with many unorthodox spiritual teachings from Theosophy to the psychology of Carl Jung. After de Chardin's death his papers were suppressed by the Vatican and his work was investigated on charges of heresy (his ideas being heretical by the standards of the Catholic Church.)When Blatty declined to write Warner Bros.' sequel, John Boorman and his creative associate Rospo Pallenberg developed an original script from a treatment by playwright William Goodhart, the credited screenwriter. Boorman accepted the project as a means to artistically express metaphysical ideas in which he was absorbed. The link to Teilhard De Chardin provided an ideal venue. The story of Father Lamont's spiritual odyssey is specifically a meditation on the Grail Quest theme, derived from Celtic mysticism and Arthurian legend, which underlie a thematically-related sequence in Boorman's early work: DELIVERANCE, ZARDOZ, EXORCIST II: THE HERETIC, Excalibur and THE EMERALD FOREST, comprising an important cinematic exploration of the Quest as Initiatory path.In EXORCIST II: THE HERETIC, the late Father Merrin's reputation has fallen into disrepute and Father Lamont (Richard Burton), suffering a crisis of faith, is ordered by the Cardinal to investigate \"the circumstances surrounding the death of Father Merrin\" and the legitimacy of the exorcism before Merrin's papers (his life's work) can be released.The title character of THE EXORCIST was that of Father Merrin (Max Von Sydow); this role then passed to the younger priest, Father Karras (Jason Miller). Just so, the heretic in EXORCIST II is initially Merrin until, through young Regan (Linda Blair), Father Lamont makes contact with the mind of Merrin and in that psychic joining shares his vision. Thus Lamont's descent into (and beyond) heresy is an initiatory quest which deepens as he goes against the Church's orders and ultimately calls upon the demon for guidance to the \"evil heart\" of the mystery.In the scene at the Natural History Museum, the attentively listening viewer will discover (in the full 117-minute version) that Father Lamont tells Regan about Teilhard de Chardin and briefly explains the World Mind theory. The science-fictional device called the Synchronizer allows the World Mind concept to be expressed in cinematic images. (Among the many differences between this film and THE HERETIC is that the original's emphasis is strongly verbal whereas THE HERETIC expresses its complex ideas almost entirely in visual and symbolic terms.) A distinction is drawn between the peace and unity of the World Mind and the insanity (\"evil\") and corruption of its opposite, the ego: a state of separation from consciousness which mimics the One-Mindedness of God or the Universe. In THE HERETIC, this imitation or false Christ is symbolized by Pazuzu, the Babylonian genie and locust god--one of many \"heathen\" idols demonized in the Judeo-Christian tradition. (The demon was named in Blatty's novel but not in the original film.) Its activity of separation masked as joining is symbolized by the locust swarm which forms a single-mindlessness (\"a Locust Mind, if you will\") in mockery of Whole (Holy) Consciousness (Spirit). The resulting psychic fragmentation is reflected in the mirror images which permeate the film. Regan represents an evolutionary step toward the \"Omega Point\", the healing of the separation; a forerunner of Kubrick's Star Child.John Boorman's film doesn't spell itself out for the viewer any more than does Kubrick's 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY and there is no Arthur C. Clarke novel to \"explain it all for us\". Boorman intends THE HERETIC to stimulate intelligent and imaginative thought and speculation. Where Kubrick and Clarke's ideas (initially met with great perplexity) have long been sanctioned as worthy of consideration, Boorman's somehow flew over the heads of a viewer-ship which, threatened by the film's non-dualistic subversion of the original's simplistic \"good vs. evil\" formula, has for thirty years ridiculed a misunderstood artwork. The original mass audience which condemned the film on first release was fresh from making the relatively ghastly Italian EXORCIST imitation Beyond the Door a huge box office success because it gave them what they wanted and only what they wanted: puke, puke and more puke. And so like the swarming locusts, the mundane Philistine mentality endlessly repeats the hypnotic chant: \"worst sequel, worst sequel, worst...\" There is no actual \"Director's Cut\" of EXORCIST II: THE HERETIC. The 117-minute Theatrical Version is John Boorman's official cut.During the disastrous initial release, Warner Bros. hastily issued instructions to theaters to remove specified sections of the film which had drawn audience hostility, without consulting the director. Under extreme pressure, Boorman subsequently prepared a third, more carefully edited version for the international release. The re-editing rendered a difficult and highly symbolic film incomprehensible to the horror-show expectations of the audience. The most significant deletion was the discussion of Teilhard de Chardin's World Mind theory, the central focus of the film.This bastardized version debuted on cable in the United States and for a decade the film was available exclusively in this distorted form. The full-length version, unseen since the early weeks of the initial release, was restored in the late 1980's for home video and is currently available on DVD. Mercifully, the Butcher's Cut has been permanently withdrawn.Given his experience with the film, it is unlikely that Boorman would involve himself in a new Director's Cut edition. Given the mindless disrespect shown the film, he seems to have washed his hands of it and its detractors.Rating: EXTRAORDINARY.",

It makes perfect sense that anybody stepping up to direct a sequel to \"The Exorcist\" would have to go in some other direction than William Friedkin did with the original. There's no way they could top the ice-cold horror and vulgarity of \"The Exorcist\". \"Exorcist II\" deals with such heady and important themes as global consciousness, spontaneous healing, telepathy, technology, dreams, faith, and loss of faith. Linda Blair returns as Regan MacNeil, now four years older, who remembers her experience of possession all too well. She is still in the care of family friend Sharon (Kitty Winn, returning from the original \"Exorcist\") It seems Sharon left the MacNeil household for two years, but was drawn back to Regan and claims, unexpectedly and poignantly, that when she is with Regan is \"the only time I'm at peace.\" Regan and Sharon now live in a gorgeous skyscraper with a perilous-looking balcony, and Regan has a therapist, Dr. Gene Tuskin (Oscar-winner Louise Fletcher) who works with the deaf and the autistic at a state-of-the-art, high-tech facility where she does ground-breaking work with hypnosis. Regan is plagued by memories of her possession, and by strange dreams of flying with a locust swarm over Africa. Dr. Tuskin encourages her to talk about her feelings, but it is clear that Regan isn't sure it will do either of them any good. Before long, we meet Father Lamont (Richard Burton) a priest who has come to doubt his faith. He is dispatched by the church to investigate the death of Father Merrin (Max Von Sydow, who returns to play a younger version of his doomed character from the first movie) Father Lamont visits Dr. Tuskin to ask for her support in interviewing Regan about what happened to her in Washington. Dr. Tuskin is leery but Regan is intrigued, and it is agreed that Father Lamont will observe a hypnotherapy session between them. This leads to a confrontation between Pazuzu (the spirit that still haunts Regan) and Dr. Tuskin that Father Lamont is able to witness, using a delicate machine that can synchronize the experiences of two minds. Lamont comes away from the experience galvanized to protect Regan. The story is interspersed with scenes of the earlier experiences of Father Merrin when he was exorcising Pazuzu from a young boy in Africa. This boy, Kakumo (the always-wonderful James Earl Jones) grows up to be a scientist who is studying the destructive swarm behavior of locusts. He tells Lamont of his plan to breed a \"good locust\", one that will calm the others and decrease their destructive behavior. Regan, meanwhile, is showing signs of being the human equivalent of the good locust. She unwittingly heals an autistic child, and seems to now have the gifts of precognition and telepathy. Father Lamont comes to believe that Regan is touched by God, and therefore is extremely important to saving the rest of mankind from evil. The principals are all drawn to Washington and back to the brownstone where Regan lived during her previous possession. Father Lamont and Regan travel together, while Sharon and Dr. Tuskin arrive soon after; but, as always, Pazuzu is keeping track, and he tries to kill Sharon and Dr. Tuskin in an automobile accident. They survive, but only until Sharon burns herself alive in an excruciating scene. Pazuzu finally appears to Lamont in the form of Regan's sexy and evil double. As bewitched as he is by her, ultimately he overcomes this and rips the very heart from the beast, bringing peace and hope to the world once more. Technically, every frame of this film is fascinating. The colors are subdued but amazing, and the imagery is always surreal and alive and moving. There are great, swirling shots in this movie that leave me swooning every time I look at them. There is a particular shot from Regan's balcony that pans the surrounding city (including an ominous-looking church) that is one of the most haunting shots I've ever seen in a film. The music of \"Exorcist II\", by Ennio Morricone, ranges from the energetic and primitive (over the African flying sequences) to the ethereal and exquisite \"Regan's Theme\". Many of the exterior Africa scenes were shot on a sound stage, and it only adds to the fantasy atmosphere. The scene of a locust swarm descending on Washington DC is truly inspired and terrifying, and the scientific locust footage has the same creepy documentary feeling of the original film. The finale of the movie is not to be missed; it is both apocalyptic and hopeful at the same time. One of the great things about the script is that it raises questions that it cannot answer. Much is left to the viewer to ponder, and I think that is part of the point. Too many films spoon-feed or condescend to audiences, and I find it refreshing that Boorman and writer William Goodheart did not do this. The quality of the performances in \"Exorcist II\" vary; Louise Fletcher could have tried a little harder, but nearly her entire performance is dubbed, so I'm not sure she should take all the blame. Burton's character is full of inner conflict, so his performance is quiet and tense. Kitty Winn plays Sharon very differently here than she did in \"The Exorcist\"; where in the first film she was mousy, here she is defiant and volcanic. James Earl Jones is naturally commanding of the screen. Linda Blair does well in her role, and looks more beautiful than in any other film, as if she is illuminated from within. During her hypnosis scenes she has the most intense and effective stare. And when she is walking trance-like across her balcony, wearing white and with her hair flowing (all in slow-motion) she is a vision of utter, innocent beauty. She is the goddess who must help deliver the world from its own worst self. She is 'the good locust'.",

In its complete state, EXORCIST II: THE HERETIC could have very well been one of the best sequels ever made, worthy of mention in the same vein as ALIENS, GODFATHER 2 and even TERMINATOR 2. But in their corporate \"wisdom,\" I have to assume that Warner Brothers figured that audiences were too impatient or too stupid to 'get' everything that the movie was trying to say, so they yanked creative control away from John Boorman, and recut it into the disjointed monstrosity that most moviegoers have had the enormous misfortune to see. I dream that someday Mr. Boorman will be able to restore it and release a deluxe DVD edition that will leave both film buffs and critics alike absolutely speechless...and I mean in a GOOD way. Assuming, of course, that the vital footage has not been lost forever. Until then, this version deserves every bit of the ridicule it has received and then some. Die hard fans of the featured actors may still want to catch it, because the discerning eye will be able to tell from the performances of Burton, Blair, Fletcher and Kitty Winn that there's a lot of \"between-the-lines\" material that is missing, thereby rendering great performances from everyone involved into massive attacks of something resembling cinematic Tourette's Syndrome.\nAnd even with the way it was wrecked, regardless of popular opinion, I still consider the score to be among the best that Morricone has ever composed for any film, (with his absolute best a tie between ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST and THE UNTOUCHABLES.)",

            "content": "As everyone knows by now, The Exorcist is a horror classic. This film would be a horror classic as well if it wasn't so misunderstood. This film mixes horror, science fiction, and fantasy all in one film. It is pervaded with a dreamlike atmosphere to the point in which it doesn't even feel as if you're watching a film when you see it. It feels as if you're right in the middle of a bizarre nightmare you can't wake up from, similar to Suspiria. The music contributes to this dreamlike atmosphere in a way I have never heard a score contribute to the atmosphere before. Ennio Morricone did a terrific job at composing the score. Listening to this score alone, you can see it's really no wonder he's considered a legendary composer. The camera-work also achieved the effect of contributing the dreamlike atmosphere.I believe the reason so many people dislike it is because it is so different in tone to the first film. People watch the film expecting it to be exactly the same as the first and it isn't whatsoever. It is a very unique film experience that feels nothing like the first film. While the first film was a straight horror/drama grounded in reality for the most part, this film goes it's own route and is highly fantastical. If it was simply called The Heretic, I think people would like it a lot more. Because it's a sequel, people can't seem to get the first film out of their mind and constantly compare it.The film gives a reason for Regan's possession. It gives the idea that she had the gift of healing as the reason she was possessed. Satan wanted to destroy this gift because it was used for goodness, so he sent a demon to possess Regan. I believe that was a genius and creative idea. There is a touching scene in which Regan causes an autistic girl who is mute speak for the first time in front of her mother. It always gives me goosebumps no matter how many times I see the film. The story which is very well written cleverly links the past with the future. While it gives fresh ideas and builds on the story of Regan's life and the aftermath of her possession, it also delves further into the past by showing Father Merrin's prior experience with exorcism before he met Regan. It is also brilliantly acted. Linda Blair is terrific and it's good to see her play Regan yet again. It was also nice to see Kitty Winn for the second time. Louise Fletcher, James Earl Jones, Richard Burton, Paul Henreid, and Ned Beatty are also among the all star cast and give unforgettable performances.Overall, I think the amount of hatred this film receives is absolutely unfair. It deserves none of it. It is one of the most underrated, misunderstood films of all time. Sometimes I even enjoy it more than the first film. Please don't let the bad reputation this film has discourage you from watching it. You may have the same feelings about the film that I do.",

Although at times the symbolism is a bit heavy-handed, Exorcist II is still one of the more thought-provoking and intelligent Hollywood films.

If the plot is incomprehensible it is no more so than that of most horror films, and Boorman's masterful direction gives it a gravity and emotional resonance that bring it close to the level of Dreyer's \"Vampyr\".Let's hope the DVD release will bring new converts to this amazing work.",

            "content": "Probably one of the most despised sequels in movie history, this bizarrity is worth a look if you've been avoiding it. Although overlong and sometimes dull, there are plenty of memorable images in this film which stand out. The film ventures into art territory many times, making it hard to sit through for more conventional viewers, but there are also some creepy/disturbing scenes to savour. The fact that I didn't really get into it is more a flaw with myself than with the film, and with the right attention I'm sure there are things to be gained from this. I didn't like it very much though.The plot starts off typically, with Regan in therapy and the demon threatening to rear its ugly head again. A new priest gets involved in the case and hooks himself up in a mental link - via a machine called a synchroniser (you heard me right) - with Regan. From then on we're subjected to lots of scenes of natives singing and a recurring nightmare of a swarm of locusts descending out of the sky. The priest, Lamont, travels to Africa, but is shunned by the natives who stone him, believing him to be a devil-worshipping. He gradually becomes sucked in by the evil force which lies dominant and wills him to kill Regan. Finally, he fights back, and all hell breaks loose.The visual composition of the film is more important than the actual storyline here, and so characters come and go as time goes on. Max Von Sydow, from the first film, appears in flashback as Father Merrin, exorcising a young boy healer in Africa. Ned Beatty appears as a pilot with a gigantic cross on his back, while James Earl Jones has the duel role of a native dressed as a giant locust - a god perhaps - and a kindly doctor. Linda Blair returns to the role which propelled her into stardom, and she has by now nearly reached adulthood - as can be clearly seen. Blair is fine as the investigative, inquiring girl, but is really given a supporting role, as is the good Louise Fletcher. The film belongs to Richard Burton - an ageing, profusely sweating actor who goes on a moral crusade from A to B and back again as the doubtful priest who fights Pazuzu to prove himself. On the way there's lots of mumbo jumbo.Events pick up for an over-the-top climax, but by then we don't really care what happens anymore. There is some minor gore (hearts being torn out, spikes penetrating feet) but nothing comes close to the nauseating, sickening power of the original classic, although the scary demon makeup is used briefly a couple of times. If an effort is made to like this film, then I'm sure it will appear underrated, but it's an effort which I just simply wasn't willing to give - I felt both cheated and disappointed in this film, which was something I just wasn't expecting. Not bad; good on an artistic level... but as a horror film, it just doesn't work, as it's just TOO unconventional and, it has to be said, pretentious. Oh, there's a good score from Ennio Morricone which makes things a bit more bearable, on the plus side.",

These are elements I would not expect from a movie from this time period, I mean, an invention which would show the existence of a spiritual plane, as is present in Dan Brown's Lost Symbol; the fact that Time and Space are warped and rendered obsolete, something hugely successful in movies such as 'Paranormal Activities', or even 'Insidious'!Then, a Lovecraftian obscure deity instead of your normal monsters, true to Islamic Jinn mythology, mixed with the Biblical Locust plague, which is being rediscovered in movies such as 'The Ritual', 'Sinister', 'The Shrine', and many other new productions!Ultimately, ending with a groveling, and absolutely original climax, com'on, I get it that people were expecting something more in line with the first movie, but people should have been more forgiving.However, there was still room for improvement; the whole movie felt like some hurried collage, which makes it 'trippy' in a bad way.

If you are one of those people who hold this opinion because you think it represents all-around bad practice in the field of film-making, then I would disagree, but at least to dislike it for this reason has got to be better than simply hating it because it doesn't bear much resemblance to the original film, and you wanted more of the same.The sequel is an 'origin' story, and not merely a rehash of the initial scenario. This affords Boorman greater scope, and boy does he take advantage of it. We get plenty of back-story about the cultural background from which the daemon Pazuzu sprang itself; and because much of the screen time is devoted to this, it's almost as if the story is being told to the audience from that perspective. It's harder to root for Regan here, because for so much of the time she's on the periphery of things. The watcher is instead forced to take roost with the side of evil; something which granted is not familiar territory for the masses, but you'd have thought they might've been able to accept it a little bit better than they did. Such a move has its obvious advantages, however, as it does give rise to plenty of stunning imagery. Locusts feature in ways which may be bizarre to some tastes, but are definitely fantastic to observe, and with the much heralded biblical connection I find it surprising and dismaying that people aren't willing to permit the director more in the way of 'artistic license', but oh well...There is much philosophical debate about the balance of good and evil within the world; and the continuous struggle that is playing itself out, with some of our characters being the unfortunate victims. I liked the attempt to enrich the story because there's obviously a whole heap of subtext where religious matters are concerned and it raises the stakes if issues become apocalyptic, rather than being exclusively focused on one single family. The fresh themes and material that an expansion like this provides access to are practically infinite, and it was pleasing to me because I'm tired of seeing the same stuff being repeated over and over again, in follow-ups.There are certainly anomalies to be found which don't make sense within the real world as we know it; but why shouldn't this be allowed in a genre that asks most of us to give power to things beyond our experience as a matter of course, anyway? Plus, as mentioned, a great deal of time is spent ensconced right at the source of things myth and legend. I can forgive concepts and happenings that would otherwise look silly if we are at least presented with a reason for them being there; and the movie does that. Those individuals that didn't catch on first time should at least make the allowance of watching again; because if you try not to be taken over by incredulity, you'll find that occurrences have actually been explained. Some of the acting might also be hammy; but again, what develops leads right to the edge of hysteria, so why shouldn't Burton and others give their performances as if they are on the brink of spiralling out of control?Time and time again I find movie fans and users of this site from all over grousing about how there's no originality left, and how most sequels are cheap cash-ins. Yet what happens when a work appears that contravenes those standards? It gets derided and ultimately ignored. Well, you reap what you sow. Ambitious movies which open only to be met with scorn and indifference are why studios don't take chances anymore. I'm not claiming that 'Exorcist II' gets it right 100% of the time, because it doesn't, but it's brave in its choices, and that I admire. If you refuse to open your mind to this movie, then it's your loss. I for one am happy that I got the chance to experience it.",

It happened with the sequels to the Matrix, which are both excellent, and also with practically every film by M. Night Shyamalan after The Sixth Sense. As long as some audiences impair their own sensibilities by prioritizing comparisons of books, music pieces or films instead of fostering their own ability to appreciate a work of art on its own, the message delivered by the work will go over their heads and be lost.Fortunately, time can heal generational misconceptions. Boorman is a very good director, and this is a film rich in imagery, philosophy, and thought-provoking themes. That they were able to create it even after going through what was obviously a bumpy production process makes it perhaps even more valuable.

It had in my opinion a very good plot. I thought it was very cool how they went into detail about the past of Father Merrin while still focusing on what Regan is going through, and I'm glad they didn't do the same monster. I really liked how they set Father Lemont up to have to choose between the angelic Regan and the sinful Regan,and speaking of Regan Linda Blair was awesome. Going back to the end, I love how even though they looked the same and were dressed the same she managed to make the costume work, and make it look like an innocent sort of dress for one, yet at the same time the evil Regan looked sexy in the same dress!All in all I thought it was a darn good sequel and give it a 7/10!",

            "content": "The Exorcist II: The Heretic is, in my opinion, one of the most underrated movies ever. A well-known flop both in terms of box office and reviews. It's only but great sin is being the sequel of one of the most acclaimed and highest grossing movies in film history. \"The Heretic\" lacks enough scares to be qualified even as a scary movie, and the first \"Exorcist\" is widely regarded as \"the scariest movie ever\". The John Boorman's movie moves away from the genre in order to offer an independent work with a different visual and narrative style. But beyond the prejudice for being the next part of a great classic and, therefore, the high expectations placed on it, the main failure of the film (and from my point of view the only one) is its very complex plot, full of details and with an excess of information that, coupled with a somewhat neglected narrative development, built a film difficult to understand and, at times, slow and somewhat boring. A script in which take place the continuation of the story (of her protagonist Regan, played again for the beautiful Linda Blair), the supposed heresy of a priest, the eternal struggle between science and religion and metaphysics. A really far from mainstream content. But apart from its difficult understanding, its estrangement from the genre of the first movie and its slow development, \"The Heretic\" is still a NOTEWORTHY MOVIE, especially if not compared to the first one. This film is valuable in itself. Personally I appreciate the risk and originality to create a new work of art. Because, above all, this movie has a remarkable art direction that helps to maintain the interest, and to lighten its dense story. The African landscapes, with simply sensational background music and an impressive use of the footage create a dreamlike feeling very accomplished. The music also stands out in other scenes of great visual impact, such as that in which Regan looks thoughtfully at its roof in an attic in New York, with a strongly beautiful score, \"Regan's Theme\" a melancholic and somewhat angelic theme, suggesting this girl, formerly victim of a demon, is a special human being. It's really worthy of mention this John Boorman's ability to convey certain feelings and emotions with a simple but very effective right mix of music and image. And while many dialogs have the certain innocence of that years (the 1970s), I think that almost the whole cast ensemble match their respective characters. Draws particular attention the angelic beauty of Linda Blair, who in this movie gets rid of the unpleasant character of the previous film to offer a girl that no longer possessed (although at the risk of being again) appears (as stated before) as a kind of messiah, an envoy to do the good. I think it is a worthy and remarkable film. I'm surprised the terrible criticism raised, especially when today almost no Hollywood film has content. Maybe with a more understandable script, a little less of footage, and a few more scares, the film had managed to won the public's support. I admit it is a dense film, you can like it, you can dislike it. But no one is indifferent to it. I can't understand how the reviewers, who always support anything that away from the easy way, don't like this movie (despite its failures). It's easier to understand its relative flop at the box office (It grossed over $30 million dollars at that time, thereby it was profitable, although not as expected) because is very difficult to market it for being difficult to place it in a specific genre. But in short, I keep going thinking the same. It is one of the most underrated movies ever and I encourage a new revision. The film deserves to be watched twice at last, and unbiased. You may find, among the entire jumble, a potential masterpiece that was never a masterpiece but shows its aims to be that. If seeing any crap movie from Hollywood now, those that offer a lot of FX and no content, do you really think that \"The Exorcist II\" is a bad film? It may be not easy to watch, but I think its strengths are too numerous to be considered a crap.The best: - The amazing soundtrack by Ennio Morricone. Stunning! - The cinematography and the visuals - The whole cast ensemble. Linda Blair: an angel. - Its originality and risk - The storyThe worst - Lack of scares (in my opinion it is not a failure, but compared to the first film its seems to be too light) - The difficulty to understand some things, due to its dense and a little complicated script - The ending, forced and not too conclusiveOverall: it needs a further review and another chance. I can't understand the so much hatred to this enjoyable and personal movie.",

Which (some of it, anyway) is inspired by the flying sequences in Murnau's underrated \"Faust,\" only in gloriously amber color, as if Boorman smeared honey on his lenses.The film is a great something--sometimes I think a monumental sick joke on religion, sometimes I think a fantastic film-making experiment that you shouldn't (for the sake of your sanity) take too seriously.

Of course it's quite different from it's predecessor, so maybe some people would watch this movie with wrong expectations. But it is really entertaining movie with a mystic atmosphere and yes, good actors. Of course, if you really want to point out some things that might be unrealistic, go for it. Of course it doesn't and probably will never exist anything like a synchronizer that synchronizes the minds of two persons. And yes, of course it's not necessary to have these lights at the synchronizer, but who the hell did ever had similar thoughts about the beamer of the enterprise?! Or did anybody had problems that in any (even the good) sci-fi movie of the 80s, you had to see the same \"futuristic\" typo graphs, which aren't even stylish nowadays and probably won't be in one hundred years, in which time these movies took place? So where's the problem about these unimportant things, what a \"synchronizer\" looks or sounds like? What's important is THE STORY, THE IDEA behind the movie. And the idea behind The Heretic is an interesting, mystic one. Compared to hundreds of other horror movies this one is a really good film. My recommendation: Go and watch it yourself, and make your own mind. By the way, I'm really into horror-movies, occult-thrillers and i've seen lots of films and splatter films don't knock me off the chair, but I never had to laugh at no time in this film...and that's good for a horror movie!",

This film goes in a completely opposite direction.  Second, the acting is pretty bad in most respects.  Burton is decent, but Fletcher and Blair are pretty useless in their roles, and Winn is simply annoying.  Third, the script and dialogue are dreadful while the plot and story itself are fantastic.

            "content": "Why that bad? I liked this movie even more than first one (although it has a very high quality which had not been matched by any sequel) but I liked the different style of this one, with an interesting metaphysics background and the emotional evolution of the first movie's characters, especially Regan, not a possessed girl anymore but a feminine Messiah. I think the movie has some failures in its execution, with some cheesy scenes and dialogs and some overacted performances, especially Richard Burton. But the final result is amazing. I like the feeling of the African sceneries and that music theme sounding when Linda Blair is on scene. This movie has a positive feeling; it's the Good, opposite to the Evil shown in the first. It suggests that the Evil goes after good people (the nurse who heals the sick, Regan that seems to be special), and I like that idea. I think people didn't understand or didn't like that change, but, another \"Exorcist\" replica would have been better? Maybe for the box office, but what John Boorman did with this was a bizarre but quite worthy follow-up to the 1973 smash hit. I think it is commendable. Maybe it is not a masterpiece, I agree that it is not for the masses, it has a confusing history and slow, not easily digestible by everyone, but it has \"something\". Maybe what the director wanted for the movie but lost in translation. This very pretentious movie seems it could have been greater and better but finally results in a strange and sometimes complicated mixture of religious and philosophical theories, with some scares (not enough for the audience) and a great adventure film component. But whether you like it or not, something is certain, at any rate, it is a beautiful film to watch: visually exciting and musically captivating.",

Anneliese Michel, the lady the Emily Rose was based on, was a German college student and died in 76. The Exorcist 2 was made, or finished in, 77. The plots to the two movies are so similar in ways it is not funny. The character of the person who was watching Reagan, I believe, represented the trial and jury. Metaphors can be an amazing thing.

The premise is interesting: four years later, a priest, Father Phillip Lamont, (Richard Burton) is asked by the Cardinal (Paul Henreid) to investigate the work of Father Lankaster Merrin (Max Von Sydow), particularly his last exorcism and unexplained death. The reluctant clergyman tracks down Regan MacNeil (Linda Blair), now a young woman, who is still under psychiatric care, where her doctor, Gene Tuskin (Louise Fletcher) is trying to retrieve the girl's repressed memories of her possession. Still plagued by nightmares, Regan agrees to undergo hypnosis, aided by a machine that can transfer her thoughts and images into another person's mind. Both doctor and priest discover that the demon Pazuzu that had possessed her is still attempting to take over. Due to the transfer of thoughts, Father Merrin's past work and warnings takes us on a trip to Africa, back to the house in Georgetown, and into a swarm of giant locusts. It is revealed that the victims of the ghastly entity's torture are healers -and therefore saviors of the world. The music, by Ennio Morricone, especially Regan's theme, is beautiful and haunting. Director John Boorman extensively recut the film several times, due to the scathing reviews of critics and public alike (the latter of which threw objects at the screen during its viewings), but the film was quickly withdrawn from the theatres. Restored to the original cut on video and DVD, the visuals, effects and music are top-notch; unfortunately, the screenplay and the clashing of images make the film somewhat incoherent and hard to follow. The competent cast tries gamely, but despite the hypnotic gaze and voice of Burton, Fletcher's warmth and Blair's energy, and the rest of the performer's efforts, they become increasingly lost in the perplexing imagery.

William Peter Blatty (author of the book and screenplay for The Exorcist) has been reported as really hating this movie. I understand their reaction as this strange art-house movie has little to do with the first. Boorman's films are often less than accessible to the general public, frustratingly incomprehensible at times, and nothing like the standard popcorn-fare that makes up most of popular cinema - and the first Exorcist is a masterpiece of popcorn horror. This flick is a whole 'nother beast.The acting is quite good throughout - it's Richard Burton, Lousie Fletcher, Max Von Sydow, and James Earl Jones after all. The cinematography and direction are superb - but it is intentionally of a certain 70's expressionistic flair that most moviegoers aren't familiar with nor would they like it. The locust-cam may seem silly to some people, but I found it quite effective, not to mention friggin' cool. The mind-melding scene was amazing, and I had to play the scene over a couple times to figure out how Boorman was able to film it at all. It's quite an impressive camera trick that he pulls off; the effect of which, sadly, can easily be missed if the film is being watched on an average-sized television.I won't tell much about the plot, because speaking about the plot would only confuse most and spoil the fun for the few who will find this film to be brilliant. If you're looking for a horror movie, don't look to this film at all. It barely qualifies as a horror movie in any way. It's more of a theatrical-scifi-spiritual-epic journey with some horror elements driving the plot. It makes me think of David Bowie for some reason which I can't clearly pin down. But really it's not containable in any genre or understandable through brief description. If you're interested watch the preview online, which does make it look a little more action-packed than it really is - but I say that believing it to be one of the best trailers ever made. It will give you a brief taste of the movie, although it was clearly made to trick the average moviegoer into seeing something that he or she wasn't prepared for, and mostly didn't want.Not Boorman's finest film, but it vies for position among them. It is one of the weirder movies to come out of the seventies, and I realize all that that implies. I thought it was fantastic. It is under-appreciated - movies like this couldn't get made these days.

Not that this would make any difference neither in this world nor to the opinion that you people already have about this film. As a viewer I had a \"deja vue\" when the grasshopper flew over Africa, but that's personal. Rationally, this film had far more intelligent ideas than the first one. The first one was loud, impressive, perfect directed and had a magic unexplainable power, but it's only story was a freaked out minor who did crazy things. Why was she possessed? Who was that spirit? Who was father Merrin? etc etc was never answered to the first one. They just gave us some clues, but we never saw what really happened. We just believed whatever the characters were saying. In the sequel, which is more a normal film than a horror film, they gave us answers; and very interesting ones. So this minor is a very powerful human. She represents the good. The grasshoppers represent the evil. When they touch each other they stick and their personality changes. They become angry and perform evil acts. That minor has the power to separate the grasshoppers and turn them back to their normal behavior, preventing them from being evil. That example works, clearly, for us humans. As we know wars happen by a person who changes the normal behavior of a big group of people, i.e. Nazi's, and makes them evil. A minor like the character in the sequel would go inside that group of people (like an opinion leader??), and bring them back to their normal behavior. And that explains why it's the devil inside her and not just another spirit. She's THAT strong! And the concept of: \"if U touch my wings U are now mine\" it's so realistic of what is going on in our everyday, I think. It actually means: \"if you are evil for once you stay evil forever, there's no way back\".

There's something about this movie that entirely captivates me - Boorman made Deliverance, yes, and that movie has tension and builds to its denouement, but The Heretic? This movie has plain weird on a scale I hadn't seen since Kubrick's 2001. I PAID to see this movie about 20 times in the theatres, I became so obsessed with it. (Mmm I seem to remember also having an attachment to Rollerball,,,OK, I *was* in my early 20's ) - However , I don't think I would have had such an investment in this movie without seeing Exorcist I... EI was the 1st act here, and Boorman took what was a plain horror movie ( don't buy in to the hype around at the time of The Exorcist of having Doctors and nurses on standby in the cinemas \"In Case\" and all that sh*t)( I actually got asked to leave a theatre showing Exorcist 1 for laughing during the \"Reagan wets the carpet\" scene.. d'oh! and turned it into something that would make me question my religious beliefs - I didn't believe in God then... and I still don't - but do I believe in Good and Evil as abstract forces in the world? This film made me question that, and can people who have been \"brushed with the wings\" of evil help those who are struggling? Mmm.. aren't a lot of recovering/recovered drug addicts working with young people to try and break the cycle? Pazuzu can be a bitch if you aren't careful! (ask Kitty Winn!)",

            "content": "\"Eeee-villl\" says Richard Burton, unconvincingly cast as a conflicted Man of the Cloth in this follow-up to 1973's \"The Exorcist\". He attempts to purge mind demons from possession-survivor Regan (a vaguely distraught Linda Blair). Louise Fletcher (as Dr. Tuskin, Regan's therapist) and Kitty Winn (returning from the original as Regan's guardian, Sharon) are both mediocre, but Burton surely fares the worst; unsuccessfully hiding his embarrassment behind a staunchly theatrical mask, his readings seem conformed to reach the high balconies, and his over-enunciation seems peculiar in these surroundings--he's angry when he shouldn't be, and vice-versa. It's been said that this film cost Burton the Oscar for \"Equus\" (released the same year). Perhaps it was the troubled production (the constant rewrites, and director John Boorman suddenly taking ill) that tripped up the actors. Blair doesn't thrive; she keeps her poise but stays aloof from the proceedings (she's also a grown-up young woman who seems to be playing down her age, for a 'cute' effect). Boorman had a vision here, but damned if anyone could figure out what it was. William Goodhart's screenplay makes an attempt to show that great goodness can be a magnet for evil (they are helplessly intertwined), and that Regan was possessed by the demon Pazuzu because she is a healer. Unfortunately, none of this makes for a scary thriller. The film is heavy-handed, \"metaphysical\" and occasionally awkward and/or unintentionally funny (when Burton goes into synch to reach Dr. Tuskin, everyone is frantic because she's breathing abnormally, so what does the assistant tell Burton? \"Relax deeply!\"). Boorman's original version (butchered after disastrous early showings) eschews Burton's opening narration and begins inside the Mexican church (not outside near the steps); it also features a corny but satisfying final tag involving Sharon and Dr. Tuskin in Georgetown. ** from ****",

You'd expect any horror movie that would be as superior as \"The Exorcist\" will be followed by a sequel a few years later. Well, it does. \"Exorcist II: The Heretic\" was long regarded as a terrible sequel, mainly because of its use of hypnotic deceptions, which soon results in to confusion. The ear-piercing dialogue (that might give Ed Wood a run for his money) surely doesn't help, and the film was eventually laughed at during its first run in theaters. But EXORCIST II, despite its most obvious flaws, is an interesting film. A failure to be sure, but almost something that has to be seen to believe. The film picks up four years later. Linda Blair is great reprising her famed role in a more adult form. Richard Burton, as a priest who investigates the death of Father Merrin from the first film, gives a nearly good performance, keeping stalwart all throughout the film.The other cast members are still well worth watching. The special-effects, missing a little from the first film, is creative. The shots are done in an outlandish fashion and Ennio Morricone score, the best element in the film, is superb.By the looks of it, the main reason why critics don't like this sequel is that they had enough in the original. The original was gruesome, but well-pressed in to the novel. Boorman's different take is indeed alienating and utterly bizarre, nothing like that frightening and accessible horror classic. Despite many bad reviews about this confusing and utterly incomprehensible sequel, I still sort of liked it. And it actually made me like \"The Exorcist\" even more.Rating: *** out of 5.",

Problem being that if it hadn't been \"Exorcist II\" it likely would never have been made.Discussing the film without thinking about the lurid details of its release (the laughter and booing from the audiences, or Boorman yanking the film from theatres after the first day to recut the whole thing) is a difficult task.  \"Exorcist II\" has become, more than a film, a litmus test for sequels.  In the opinion of some, no sequel has ever been this poor.Which is unfair.  Taken on its own, the movie is a curious mix of very inspired and very absurd moments and concepts.  The casting is problematic and wildly uneven (Fletcher and Blair are fine, Burton is awful, and James Earl Jones steals the entire show).  The script also veers from coherency to an almost surreal incompetence, sometimes in the same scene.  And yet...And yet, this is a very misunderstood film.  John Boorman was a very brave and unconventional choice as director, and he certainly accomplishes some startling and innovative visual effects.  He is also to be commended for attempting to examine the concepts of the original film (and novel) in a metaphysical and nonlinear fashion.  I've seen both cuts of the film and find that they differ from each other very little in overall impact.  The fatal flaw in either version is the film's complete failure to prepare its audience for any of this material.  Audiences were led to expect a carbon-copy repeat of the original and were instead confronted with this arty, heavily psychological mood piece.  Understandably, they were a little upset.....In no way does it accomplish its goals nearly as well as \"The Exorcist\", but I find this a far more enjoyable experience than Blatty's own \"Exorcist III\", which seems to have all of the elements with no idea as to how they should be executed.  Infuriating, uneven, and quite beautiful.  See it before you laugh at it.",

It does have, perhaps, some problems about it, problems that certainly make it either hard to believe, or too laughable for some people. I don't see anything wrong with it. What we are dealing with is a prime example of how one can use the main premise of a film to build off of in a sequel. They actually do it the right way. They don't use the first film as a crutch, and they keep the references to a minimum, so the second story can take presidency. Now, in this film, we have Reagan McNeil, four years later, and still undergoing therapy so that Mother Chris McNeil (who is absent in this film) will feel better about the fact that she is always working, and a divorc\u00e9e. Reagans doctor, Jean Tuskin, is a hard-core scientist, and doesn't believe in the supernatural, even though she knows about Reagans turbulent experience in the past. Soon, a fledging priest, Father Lamont, is called upon to make a final stand about the death of Father Merrin. His goal is to prove that evil exists, and to save Reagan from the battle that still ensues in her beautiful soul. Neither he, nor Reagan can predict what will happen, but will Jean Tuskin, the doctor, help them? Can she surrender her scientific methods to the religious battle that continuously plagues the earth? Can the evil spirits of the air lead our protagonists to the truth behind all demonic possession on earth? You must watch the film to get the answers. This film is just fine for me. After all, it was made, technically, just as well, if not better, than the first, and it's a good example of how to use pseudo-science for fun and experiment in fantasy. It also has many symbolic references to the human mind, some visible, others not so much. The only downfalls are a few moments that, if edited, would take away some snicker feelings the viewer might get. I won't lie, some of the voicing of the demon is awful, but it's not the worst. It's just a different take on it. Why America is not so accepting of this film is anyone's guess. Maybe director John Boorman was right. Perhaps is WAS to good for most people...",

Admittedly The Exorcist did some of that too, but at least it was tied to a rational plot and characters. In this mess nothing is coherent, and the entire concept of some demon who is not the Devil but is called Pazuzu and flies around in the shape of a big locust while a great actor like James Earl Jones wears silly costumes and mouths absurd dialogue is so far beyond the rational it reduces the movie to self-parody. Richard Burton is here overacting with the turgid lines he's been given. Linda Blair seemed in a daze. The final scenes in which the entire house in Georgetown, the same one from the first film, gets wrecked and someone burned alive and swarms of locusts descend is just ludicrous. When it is over the viewer also will be in a daze - it is impossible to believe a plot this bad was ever approved and put on film. It is one of the worst films of all time.",

The collapse of humanity into one group mind (obvious references to de Chardin's notion of noosphere, drawn by father Lamont), the parallels between insect (locust) and human society regarding the spread of destructive/violent behavior (check mass psychology, research on swarm intelligence, the popularity of Steven Johnson's 'Emergence' etc.)So, for those of you expecting horror movie chills and thrills - you should skip this one.

I don't care that much for horror because 99% of them are either boring/stupid/or just for laughs. I had never seen \"The Exorcist\" until a couple of weeks ago. I was told and have heard that it was one of the best if not the best horror movie created so far. I watched it and it scared me a little, which no movie i have seen since i was very young has done. It was also great with special effects, and the story line, and after i saw it once, it became one of my top favorite movies, which is usually a movie i will purchase and can watch allot without getting bored. I wanted to watch the sequels (I had only saw part of \"Exorcist III\" on tv, and i liked it so far). After a while, I searched for info on the Exorcist sequels on the internet..and got allot of info. After reading reviews (I'll stick to part 2) I was confused...I got some reviews from people who looked like they didn't even like the first movie so much that said \"The Heretic\" was one of the worst movies ever made, giving it 1 star, 1 & 1/2 stars...saying they didn't understand it...were they not paying attention? Other reviews said it was a classic, and misunderstood, not many people thought that way though. Here's what I thought. I don't think people were ready for this movie when it was released. Its different from the first since its more psychological, sort of like \"The Shining\". People believed that a sequel couldn't be good if made, and i can understand that. I don't want to see Regan get possessed again, thats stupid...as far as i know, with common sense, Pazuzu (NOT SATAN) wouldn't repossess Regan when it was already defeated, maybe want revenge, but not fall for it again, it lost already. BUT what is strange is thats what people wanted, another possession like the first...that is doomed to fail....it's the same basis but a sequel with means Not As Good As First, right?. Who wants to see the same movie again except a little different, you do want to see what has happened to Regan in the future though, and thats what I think the writer thought. With an Oscar Cast, how could this go wrong?. When this movie premiered, it was laughed at, pulled from theaters and bombed! this confuses me a lot. It had an impressive story, that made a little more sense actually than the first movie. This movie had more ideas in it than the first movie, and went together so nicely. Even If People Didn't Like This Movie, look at it, it had a complex story, meant to confuse a little (To make you think just like the first), and people are dumb enough to put this as 1 of the worst movies ever..think of the worst movie you saw...one with no reason for being made, easily written script, no ideas, nothing, one that annoyed you.....and people actually put this there? thats crazy...I think this was one of the best movies ever made, just like the original....Picture \"The Godfather\" as a 1 star movie...how would you react? Whats your or one of your favorite movies?...picture seeing it the 1st time..not knowing a rating it was given, then for curiosity finding reviews for it and having people say it was one of the worst movies ever....it would make you mad right? insult your intelligence?...well this is one of my favorite movies, I loved it, I showed my friend, he liked Exorcist a lot and thought The Heretic was better (his fav. movie)....he could get shot for that. This movie is surrounded by mystery, whats with the people that hated this movie....I don't know, maybe too good for them, too complex, can you believe one of the reasons people didn't like it is because there was a machine in it that seemed dumb because they didn't know how it could work,hmmmm was a time machine invented? i guess that means \"Back to the Future\" was 1 of the worst movies ever....at least(from what I heard), Martin Scorcese(director of Goodfellas, Casino, Raging Bull & Taxi Driver) thought it was great, he is also my fav. director. Critics aren't correct allot, Check this movie out if u liked the first and/or like complex movies that can make you think...... This Movie = **** Perfection",

I really had to struggle my way through this lousy sequel and it might easily be the most redundant film ever made. Due to a combination of several unfortunate aspects, this film is a complete failure but it hurts to see that a few, really good, aspects are completely lost, like the outstanding Ennio Morricone score and the ambitious skills of scriptwriter William Goodhart. Far too ambitious, actually. For some incomprehensible reason, the plot of this sequel focuses on unraveling the events of the original, expanding the terror's origin with environmental influences and occult African rites. Father Lamont (played by Richard Burton) is burdened with the investigation of Father Merrin's last exorcism (the one on young Regan, which cost him his life) and discovers that there's still a battle between good and evil going on inside Regan's body. The premise might sound okay but the elaboration is far too complex, incoherent and even downright uninteresting. The stupidity of several far-fetched themes results in very ridiculous lines and several \"WTF\"-sequences. \"I will spit out a leopard\"? What the hell does that mean? What's even worse is that the \"horror\" is totally ignored. Exorcist II is a completely bloodless film that doesn't even features some obscenity or grim moments. Say whatever you want about story-driven horror films, but a project that completely avoids action or gore is doomed to fail no matter how massive the cast and budget are. Speaking about the cast: I rarely saw a film that starred so many big names and delivered so few intrigue. Richard Burton overacts terribly while Louise Fletcher doesn't seem to care about the lines she's driveling. In fact, why would she care because even director John Boorman seems frustrated over this job? Many little details featuring in the movie actually show that Boorman regrets not having made the original in 1973, which would have provided him with an immortal status. The only decent performance is given by Linda Blair who \u0096 by the way \u0096 looks gorgeous here in her teenage years. She's sexy and cherubic looking at the same time and her appearance distracts you a little from the dreadful wholesome that is this film. Very much NOT recommended, folks!",

The special effects are very poor compared to today's standard, but I think the ending was VERY GOOD! I hope they will make some slight adjustments to the script and remake it as they did with the original. This film had overwhelming potential to become a classic like its original, unfortunately the director of this movie had no experience of making horror movies and the end result feels like an adventure movie made with a horror movie script!6/10",

The intermittent drone of the synchroniser can be heard just before the closing credits roll.

Did Burtons character ever come out of his trance?It would explain the dreamlike quality of the African sets and similarly the studio look of Reagans Washington house. At the climax of the film Burton fulfils all his fantasies-he resists Regans sexual advances, defeats evil and walks away with Regan into an innocent sunset.Now his own sexual desires can be fulfilled and 'good' triumphs.This could be the most misunderstood movie in cinema history or I was right in the first place and probably one of the worst!!",

            "content": "(Spoiler Alert) Checking out all the facts about young Regan MacNeil (Linda Blair) exorcism, that cost the lives of both Fathers Merrin and Karres who preformed it, the Cathloic Church in Rome sends out to New York City the very reluctant Father Lamont, Richard Burton, to investigate the case and clear Father Merrin's name. There are rumors going around in the church that Father Merrin was in fact a devil worshiper. Father Lamont has had it with the exorcism business feeling that there's nothing that he, or anyone else, can do to stop the spread of \"Evil\" in the world. Still Lamont goes to NYC to see Ragen and if she has the ability to battle Satan's evil forces.As former African tribesman and now scientist and expert on the African Desert Locust Dr. KoKumo (James Earl Ray) told Father Lamont later in the film that Ragen can keep the locusts, the agents of Satan and his top man Pazuzu, from brushing their wings. Thus preventing Pazuza from turning them into gluttonous crop eating locusts into happy-go-lucky and harmless grasshoppers. What else can be said or added to this interesting observation that Dr. Kokumo tells us? the story about the \"Grasshopper and the Ant\"? Father Lamont becomes obsessed with this idea of using Regan as the catalyst to destroy Pazuzu and his hoards after he went to Africa after hearing Dr. Kokumo revelation. Lamont is so carried away with his obsession he's almost killed by a group of Africian villages for suspecting him of being in league with the Devil. Lamont meeting Dr. Kokumo has convinced him that Regan being the human version of the good female locust who can turn the \"Evil\" locusts into \"Friendly\" grasshoppers. Back in New York an almost deranged and driven Father Lamont is going to put Dr. Kokum's theory into practice!The ending of the movie \"The Exorcist Part II\" is really too much with Father Lamont having it out with the \"Evil\" Regan who tries to seduce him and thus become corrupted by her. Meanwhile the good Regan, both parts played by Miss. Blair, just stands there on a ledge wondering what she's doing in the movie. As the battle between good and evil begins millions upon millions of locusts swarm all over the city of Washington D.C. All the action centers around the closed down and shuttered house where the exorcism of Regan took place four years ago. The scene with Father Lamont and the \"Evil\" Regan having it out in her bedroom is just too off the wall to watch without cracking up. Lamont looked as if he were drugged or drunk and acted as if he were a zombie throughout most the film. Lamont battling and ripping the \"Evil\" Regan's heart out has to be one of the most outrageous and ridicules scenes ever put on a movie screen. There's an even funnier scene earlier in the movie where Father Lamont and Regan had both their brains electronically synchronized, in a cheap hotel room in Washington Heights! This brainless action was done so that Lamont & Regan could think alike in order to combat Pazuzu and his boss the one and only \"Big Man\" himself Satan. Richard Burton looks completely out of his head in most of his scenes in the film. I wondered if after making the movie Burton accelerated his drinking just to forget that he ever made it and thus also accelerated his untimely and early death in 1984 at the age of 59.Linda Blair was a real knockout even at the early age of 17. It's no wonder that after she survived from that disaster of a movie Linda became famous for playing roles of sexy frisky and hard hitting young women who can give as good as they take from the same as well as opposite sex in films like \"Roller Boogie\" and \"Savage Streets\".Acadamy Adward Winning Actress Louise Fletcher, who played young Regan's psychiatrist and friend Dr. Gene Tuskin, also survived the movie, more or less, with her reputation still in tact. Fletcher happily got the roles in future films that her fine talents called for. Even more encouraging her role in \" The Exorcist Part II\" is almost totally forgotten by most of the movie going public.\"The Exorcist Part II\" was voted by both critics and movie goers alike the worst movie of 1977. Watching it today, some thirty years later, the only thing wrong with that opinion is that it's not just the worst movie of that year, 1977, but very possibly one the worst movie of all times.",

            "content": "The original film is one of the greatest scary movies of all time, the same cannot be said for the follow ups, I heard this first sequel was one of the worst films in the franchise, critics give it three out of five stars, I watched to make up my own mind, from director John Boorman (Deliverance). Basically, four years have passed since the events in Washington, D.C., and Regan MacNeill (Linda Blair), now sixteen years old, is living with guardian Sharon Spencer (Kitty Winn) while her mother is away filming, but she continually visits a psychiatric institute for troubled children. She claims to have no memory of what happened during her exorcism, and she seems to be normal, but she has nightmares, and Dr. Gene Tuskin (One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest's Louise Fletcher) who is monitoring her believes that her memories are repressed or buried within her mind. Dr. Tuskin has an invention to investigate this theory, a device that hypnotises two people and links their minds together, and slowly through doing this they find that the spirit of Pazuzu, the demon the possessed her, still lurks within her, and it is desperate to emerge once again and cause havoc. Father Philip Lamont (Richard Burton) has been ordered by the cardinal to investigate the death of Father Merrin (Max Von Sydow), who was killed during Regan's exorcism, Lamont reluctantly agrees and witnesses the workings of the device, listening to the doctor and young girl as they subconsciously return to that night when Merrin returned to room alone with Regan. Lamont feels unworthy of the task he has been given, as he believes evil is a literal entity and that this entity is winning over the power of good, but he comes to believe in the demonic forces, travelling to Africa and learning about Pazuzu's ability to appear as a swarm of locusts, but specifically that the demon attacks those who can heal others, Regan is able to telepathically reach others, for example helping an autistic girl to speak. Lamont slowly becomes frantic and more obsessive over these theories, and he knows that the only way to truly defeat the spirit within Regan is to return to the house in Georgetown, where the exorcism took place, it is there that Pazuzu unleashes evil, forcing the house to slowly crumble around him and Regan. In the end it is Regan that defeats Pazuzu, performing a ritual that banishes the locusts, Sharon is killed after a car crash in the flames, and while Regan and Lamont walk away together having survived the collapse of the house, Dr. Tuskin watches on remains there while the police gather and have questions to ask. Also starring Paul Henreid as The Cardinal, James Earl Jones as Older Kokumo and Ned Beatty as Edwards. Blair is still relatively likable as the innocent girl put through turmoil once again, thankfully not as harshly as before, Burton as the priest investigating past events does overplay his lines a little, it is interesting to see Fletcher being nice as opposed to quietly evil like Nurse Ratched, and Jones gets his moment as the one who has most of the answers to the mythology. The problem I have with this sequel is that surely there should be more over the top material, this instead bores you to death with chit chat about why possession occurs, talk about religious mythology, the ways the demon appears, and flashes back in time, it is only near the end the explosive stuff happens. You might as well ignore this sequel entirely and just stick with the masterpiece original (don't bother with the prequel The Beginning either), a disappointing horror film. Adequate!",

It's taking a beloved story and quite frankly defacating all over it.It does look ahead of it's time, but the story is truly awful and makes it a film that's somewhat of a struggle to get through.Truth be told as much as I'm a horror fanatic the exorcism sub-genre has always been one I've struggled to enjoy so this infamously bad title didn't stand much of a chance.From everything I've seen so far I'd advise Joe Average to watch the original film, and go no further.The Good:Looks great for its timeLinda BlairThe Bad:Plot is an utter messThings I Learnt From This Movie:Crutches are ideal tools for putting out firesLinda Blair should have had a considerably better career",

The same even tried to get out while he could (or gave) but was barred by the studio!

Starting with the soundtrack by Ennio Morriconne, what inspires us, great moments of beautiful African musical illustrations mixing with what was in vogue at the time (see the track \"Magic and Ecstasy) and of course the theme of Regan (who becomes one of simplest track)!'s performances Linda, Kitty (this always ignored the credits and everything related to the Exorcist even being one of the best in the cast) and Burton (realized that even drunk) sound natural and punchy.'s special effects are not to be desired, bright scenes, worked for the best possible realism (by the book first) envision us, even that sometimes skidded along the script a little confused, but direct, mystical, with science side by side Boormam offers in his madness, it's up to you to decide whether it was good or not!'s far from perfect, but it's not so bad as talking!",

This film is VERY dissapointing for fans of The Exorcist because this one trys to be a horror film, but fails, it's not scary and it's angles and cinematography is not brilliant. But after all of this it is still watchable. Some people will like this one better because it is more simple and less complicated and meaningful as The Exorcist. This film was very cheap and tacky, but still manages to be watchable. I wouldn't go out and spend \u00a320 on a DVD version of it, but is worth watchign if it is on TV or if you find a copy going cheap. This one is far more for young children rather then the adult audience that the Exorcist was aimed at. It is still a good movie with some good acting in it. The script and film could have done with a lot of worth, but is certainly not as good as The Exorcist because it trys to be somthing it isn't, it takes away the scaryness of Pazuzu. Before Exorcist 2 people thought that the possesser of Regan was THE Devil, which would have been much better, but now this film has made it look like the whole thing must become cheaper. Still - watch it if it is on or going cheap at a shop, but it is still no match against William Peter Blatty's The Exorcist Directed by William Friedkin.",

I actually feel that Burton's performance is one of the film's strong points. Despite the goofy plot, he maintains a straight face. And after reading that he was drunk during part of the shoot, it's pretty impressive that he can deliver such a convincing performance. The rest of the cast is good as well. Linda Blair looks cute as a button. But at nearly two hours, the movie goes on way too long. What else can I say? This movie is just plain dull! I stopped following the plot after a while, not because it got too complicated, but because I didn't care anymore.

It will be a weird, disturbing experience because your brain will be forced to work at it's maximum trying to getting explanations to the movie's events. The first reaction after watching the movie is \"what was Booram smoking during production?!\". The man was on an acid trip or something but surprisingly enough, \"The Heretic\" is a bizarre Horror movie that tries to explore different fields in order to find conclusions for the movie's events. Why would Pazuzu possess Reagan one more time? What the heck is Merrin's spirit doing here? How many dollars did J. Earl Jones get for wearing that Halloween lobster outfit?! The plot is not as bad as you think but it's very complex and leaves a lot for interpretation. In order to get conclusions you need to have a wide imagination. The explanations for Reagan's situation are very complicated. Also, the ending is really confusing. I won't spoil it because as a scene it's very memorable and visually stunning. \"The Heretic\" is a good visual experience as it has great settings in Africa, for example. The f/x are actually very good for it's time. The score is stuff for legend. The Devil surely enjoyed Disco music back in the 70's! Now that I think, \"The Heretic\" is a very well produced Horror movie. It's production values are not in discussion. The big problem is the non sense, bizarre plot. Every single scene is filled with a lot of information that is really hard to connect with the movie's past or future events. This sequel is a sui generis Horror movie because it's so bad it's almost good. Having the characters from the 1973 masterpiece was great and that's the main reason to watch the movie. Also, Linda Blair was beautiful in this one! Sorry I had to point that out.Anyways, this movie is filled with bizarre scene, something that might be good for people who like complex Horror movies. The point of this movie is to exploit the Reagan character and it does it very well. The problem is that in order to understand the movie, a second and third view is necessary.Watch \"The Heretic\" in order to witness one of the most bizarre Horror movies in history. I'm not kidding, this movie deserves it's right of self defense. Take it as what it is: a dark sequel that tried too hard from being different from the original Exorcist, the best Horror movie of all time.",

The direction by John Boorman, who is among the best directors of 1970s' thrillers, was close to asinine. The acting is pretty terrible, especially by Richard Burton that does nothing but overact all the time and behaving nastily. Louise Fletcher lacks charisma at all, and even James Earl Jones' performance and a small Max Von Sydow cameo (for giving us the connection between this film and its predecessor) couldn't have saved this movie at all, because their characters are so badly written that both Jones and Von Sydow look very bored and disengaged as well. And the soundtrack is very creepy and nightmare inducing, and then there was the scene of the african plains with that shrilling scream that was so painful to hear that I felt like my head was exploding!!! I am serious when I say that this is one of the few movies that caused me pain and it was fault of the movie!This movie has all the ingredients for a truly awful and dreadful movie: badly acted, poorly directed, written by a Jack Russell and with many scenes that make no sense whatsoever.

            "content": "Exorcist II: The Heretic is a difficult movie to write about. The things that don't work or the things that are totally ridiculous are the very reasons to watch the movie. It's an absolute mess and a helluva good time because of it. The plot - don't worry about the plot. It might make your head explode if you think too much about it. I'll give it a try, but you've been warned. Since the events of the first movie, Regan (Linda Blair) has grown to be a teenager with some sort of mental problems and a desire to perform in really bad musicals. Her mother has disappeared leaving her in the care of Dr. Tuskin (Louise Fletcher). Dr. Tuskin's idea of treatment is to have Regan stare at a blinking light bulb until she enters into a trance like state. Father Lamont (Richard Burton) shows up to study Regan's case and to announce at every opportunity he can find that there is still an eeeevil presence inside Regan. From this point forward, you really need to see it to believe it.John Boorman had what many people would consider one of the best horror movies ever made to work with when making the sequel. But at every opportunity, he takes Exorcist II into some of the most ridiculous places imaginable. He tries to get artsy, but fails miserably and ends up making scenes that should be horrific come off as silly. Take the scene where Father Lamont snaps and goes after Regan. What should have been a shocking moment is instead incredibly funny. I'm convinced that no matter how hard you tried you couldn't make a sequel this bad on purpose.The cast doesn't help Boorman at all. None of the three main leads escapes this movie looking good. First, there's Richard Burton. He chews through this movie and spits it out like a John Deere through foot high grass. Burton looks like a buffoon who overacts almost every moment he appears on screen. Next, there's Linda Blair. I like Linda Blair, but I've never thought she was much of an actress. And she proves this in Exorcist II. Her lines are delivered with all the conviction of a prostitute in church. And those dance numbers are just short of painful. Finally, Louise Fletcher acts throughout much of the movie as if she would rather be anywhere other than here. She comes across as bored, uninterested, and embarrassed to be part of this debacle.There's no end to what I could write about this movie, but I'll stop here. One of the best reviews I've ever read can be found here - http://twtd.bluemountains.net.au/Rick/exorcist2.htm. You owe it to yourself to check it out.",

            "content": "One of the most frightening films ever made got one of the dullest sequels ever made. Not only is this film boring, but none of it makes any sense at all. Apparently the demon that possessed Regan is still lurking in her body, albeit hidden very deeply. There's this weird machine that allows a person to see what the other person is thinking or some stupid thing like that. We find out that the demon that possessed Regan was already exorcised by someone in Africa. A priest goes to Africa and there's this stupid scene where he's about to fall on spikes in front of James Earl Jones.We then immediately cut to Jones with normal clothes and them in some laboratory. I have no clue what's going on and this film is so stupid I don't care. Trust me, Mom, you'd think this was worse than the original with how dumb it is. Locusts are involved a lot, which has nothing to do with \"The Exorcist\". The whole film is confusing and accomplishes nothing. I think the only saving grave was that it was nice to have Linda Blair back as Regan, but even she has too many awkward lines. Well, I'm starting with Nostalgia Critic Month and it's interesting how this is the oldest film he ever reviewed, not including DVD reviews. At least I got the video game reviews over with. *1/2",

So to examine the issue more closely her counselor \"Dr. Gene Tuskin\" (Louise Fletcher) recommends that she goes under a unique type of hypnosis in order to reveal more details to her. Meanwhile a priest by the name of \"Father Philip Lamont\" (Richard Burton) is sent to investigate her specific case and to report his findings to the \"Cardinal\" (played by Paul Henreid) in charge. As it so happens, Father Lamont manages to get there just in time to witness the hypnosis session. Unfortunately, something goes horribly wrong and Dr. Tuskin almost dies as a result. But even worse than that the session also brings the demon that possessed her back as well--and the nightmare returns all over again. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this film is an immediate sequel to one of the greatest horror movies ever produced so a great number of people had high expectations. Unfortunately, this film turned out to be a great disappointment due in large part to a weak script and some rather ridiculous scenarios--with the ending being downright laughable. In short, this movie just didn't measure up to its predecessor in any way, shape or form and I have rated it accordingly. Below average.",

            "content": "Welcome to 1977, David. Everyone else has known that this movie was insane nonsense for more than 40 years, and you just found out. Time to tell the world!Watch this and Zardoz and tell me the John Boorman is anything other than a crazy person. Read about his proposed adaptation of The Lord of the Rings (that eventually morphed into Excalibur) and tell me that that man is not an absolute nutjob. I have a slight affinity for him, by the way. I think crazy people are the kinds of people studios should occasionally throw gobs of money at. Darren Aronofsky is the modern filmmaking world's version of the 1970s John Boorman.He failed utterly at finding a way to create a sequel to The Exorcist, by the way. In fact, by the end, it's just a repeat of the final confrontation with Pazuzu involving Father Lamont instead of Father Merrin. It simply takes a confusing and unnecessarily byzantine path to get to that ending.Four years after the events of The Exorcist, Regan MacNeill has moved beyond her possession and is trying to live a normal life, while also spending every day after school with a psychiatrist who works in some kind of glass Panopticon. Now, I have to sidetrack this plot summary right at the beginning to talk a little bit about set design.When you see a location in a film that you normally associate one way, but this particular movie does something completely different, that's not by accident. That's not a mistake. That's deliberate, and the filmmakers are trying to strengthen thematic and character beats with visual motifs. So, as soon as I see this glass and mirrored hellscape of a doctor's office, I would normally start wondering why there is so much glass and so many mirrors. It extends even to Regan's apartment that has just as many mirrored surfaces and large panes of glass. However, my thinking never really got there because the movie that was playing through those locations was so completely impenetrable and filled with characters who didn't seem to understand human interactions. There was no point to ever consider the idea of doubles (extended from mirrors) and translucence (as implied by the glass), because the central themes were so jumbled and unreadable as to make what could have been interesting visual support completely pointless. As I said, John Boorman is a crazy person.So, anyway, Father Lamont (a very drunk Richard Burton) is sent by the Vatican to investigate Father Merrin's death (four years later...er...movie). He shows up and manages to use a science fiction nonsense device to do something really unclear that inserts him into Regan's mind or dream. This bit of science fiction is really unclear. The original kept its science fiction concepts much clearer, I just have to say. Anyway, moving beyond it because the literal technology doesn't actually matter, the important thing is that Lamont discovers that Pazuzu wasn't actually driven out of Regan. The demon still resides within her. Now, the way this whole scene plays out is laughably done with lines of dialogue that contradict each other said right in a row, the absurd technology, and the fact that Lamont gets to use the machine at all. It's all in the service of another visual, Regan and the memory form of a possessed Regan grasping at her psychiatrist's heart, battling over it. Again, this could be an interesting visual metaphor, but the movie is so confused that it never really takes hold beyond its basic visual impact. It's empty.Lamont ends up travelling to Africa without the Vatican's permission to research the history of Pazuzu, getting around the continent with seemingly no trouble whatsoever. It's all very confusing with attempts at some kind of visual poetics that never really connect because the ideas of the visuals are, again, completely unmoored from the narrative around them. Again, John Boorman is a crazy person.Eventually, Lamont gets possessed by Pazuzu, though that's shockingly unclear, and everyone descends upon the house from the first movie for...reasons, and we get our repeat of the first film's climax. Except that Lamont doesn't sacrifice himself like Father Merrin or Father Karras. Instead, Lamont just defeats Pazuzu in a second Regan body (again...sense is not allowed in crazy person John Boorman's films) and takes her away...or something.Reading about the film after watching it, I was most drawn to the positive notices that the film got. One of them was from Martin Scorsese himself who noted that the theme of the film was about how great good invites the creation of great evil. And this is an idea that gets touched on a couple of times in the film through voiceover, but the movie only slightly deals with the idea dramatically. There are hints that Regan is some kind of great healer somehow (she talks to a young girl who has apparently never spoken before her introduction who starts speaking mere seconds after her introduction), which is supposed to mean that Pazuzu is trying to take over her because she'll be a great force for good. That's a great idea, it's too bad that very little of the movie actually pursues that idea. Apparently the movie went through five drafts after Linda Blair signed on to what she thought was going to be a good follow up to The Exorcist, and I think it shows. There are pieces of completely different movies in here, the most glaring of which is the repeated ending that doesn't seem to belong at all. I don't know who to blame for that, but I think there's probably enough to share between crazy person John Boorman and his producers who wanted to make sure there was a good exorcism in their Exorcist movie.So, yes, in short, I have joined the rest of the world in discovering that the first Exorcist sequel is a confusing, unengaging, and delirious mess of two hours. No wonder people booed it and threw things at screens.A final note: I've read that John Boorman lays a lot of the film's negative reaction to the idea that Exorcist II: The Heretic doesn't deliver the same kind of horror that the original did. I think that's pure poppycock. The first film wasn't exactly a modern blockbuster horror delivery device for jump scares. It was a steadily paced film that was as much a character study of Father Karras as it was a horror film, most of the tropes of which didn't really appear until the final half hour. People reacted badly to The Heretic because it made no sense, was horribly constructed, and was the fever dream of a crazy person without any guard rails. It makes Zardoz look like something made by Christopher Nolan.",

I think it should have more than a 3.7 (as of 2/24/08) but hey, thats not up to me. This movie had some good scenes, particularly the ones from the past. Like the exorcism in the beginning. Also where we see Kokumo during a locust swarm was good. Even older Kokumo was pretty interesting in explaining why locusts swarm. The acting wasn't really bad, so can't complain there. Gene Tuskin was much different in this movie than in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (where she played the sadistic Nurse Ratched). Regan wasn't really bad either, she actually had a personality here other than just being possessed. Over all, not a great movie at all but not horrible either. 5/10",

Third, anyone keen for the mystique of the late 1970's will come to love this movie. There are some great shots portraying the sign of the times.

This is not a movie about excorsism, its not even a horror movie. And the acting, the lines and the music is awful. The plot makes no sense what so ever. Nothing ever happens.Instead of Reagan being possessed once again or a whole new cast we get a dumb boring story about an investigation of what really happened to Father Merrin when he exorcised the deamon in the original. As it is told in the very beginning he was killed by the deamon so why an investigation is even needed is one of the many Things that makes no sense in this movie. During this investigation the moronic Father Lamont asdsigned to investigate, travels to Africa who is apparently one big desert and we get some bogus story about grasshoppers who represents the fight between good and evil on some philosophical symbolic level. And it's all connected to Reagan. Yes it really is that stupid. Appaerently Reagan is in great danger, but apart from acting like a retarded 5 year old, Reagan is perfectly fine and healthy. But Lamont thinks he needs to save her from this deamon who is never possessing her once during the entire movie. At the end there are two physical Reagans, a possessed one and a normal one.

Like many people, the first film changed my life and is one of my absolute favorite movies of all time. I then read the book by William Peter Blatty, and have reread it a half dozen times. One of my all time favorite books. Then I saw Blatty's movie, the Exorcist III and absolutely loved that film... so I read Legion and loved that too. I am a super fan of the source material. I then became interested in the Exorcist 2 once I came across a song that someone played for me off it's soundtrack, Ennio Morricone's \"Magic And Ecstasy\" . The song is amazing and super trippy. It was at that moment I realized, ok, so the Exorcist 2 must be THAT kind of a movie and I gave it a chance. I asked my cinephile pops \"yo pops, wanna try to watch the Exorcist 2?\" He was down... so we popped the sucker in.The whole time we couldn't believe why people hated this movie so much. It was easy to understand why it wouldn't have been well accepted shortly after the first film came out. The film has a COMPLETELY different tone... but then again so did 3... but 3 came out two decades later so I think people accepted it a little more. Let me say though, the Exorcist 2: The Heretic is truly a surreal psychedelic gem! It's even spooky in parts. Its the same director as Excalibur (another trippy fantastical gem of a film with a fuzzy filter) which is totally strange and amazing as well. It's a really weird Hollywood film and shouldn't be taken so dang serious. I mean... I ADORE the first film and the novel it's based on... but I don't believe films or books are sacred... if you want to write a totally whacky sequel then go right on ahead.

            "content": "There's three types of films in this world: the good ones, the bad ones and the ones that leaves you with so many doubts you can't tell if it's good or bad. Deeper in these classifications there's another level: the films that are so terrifying you won't even want to see (a good challenge to some) and the ones you've heard so many bad things about it that you don't wanna see at all. \"Exorcist II - The Heretic\" falls into this very last category but after years of delay I decided to go ahead and see what's so bad about it. And what did I get: a good film, actually, but far from the greatness of the 1973 classic.It's really tough to succeed when you predecessor film is considered the best horror film of all time, it's impossible. Friedkin's classic was revolutionary, groundbreaking, shocking and human at the same time, it had everything that a horror film needs, in my opinion. Above all, it was believable, you could and can care about those characters. This sequel was totally unnecessary except to Warner Bros. who saw a great way to use the film as a great money grabber (and they succeed it, no matter what people think this film made money but was trashed by public and critics in terms of quality). No matter how many rewrites they have to do to make this decent it would fail anyway.However, somehow I enjoyed this film. The bomb didn't exploded after all. Once again, we have the story of people trying to save the life of poor Regan (Linda Blair) from the destructive forces of evil. This time faith and science, represented by a priest (Richard Burton) and a doctor (Louise Fletcher), will have to join forces to fight against an supernatural and powerful enemy. Along with storyline there's an investigation that finally reveals to us what happened to Father Merrin (Max von Sydow) in that room years earlier. It's pretty enjoyable to watch their drama in fighting back the problems but as a horror film is quite laughable, it's not scary and it's very problematic (no mention to Father Karras at all; the scenes in the desert are very boring; the conclusion was so confusing I didn't know if I should laugh or cry). They should've go easy on the locusts, there was too many and go on without making James Earl Jones appear dressed as one. John Boorman is not an horror director and I saw that as a big problem for this film, he didn't have the rhythm for this project; Friedkin is the same thing but he managed to do it with perfection (even if he had to fire a gun on the set just to get the right reaction from the actors). The final result is a script without originality, confusing and with far too many stories to focus. In a way I'm disappointed for not being disappointed, the pubic overreacted to this. Good performances can be found here (Burton mainly), the cinematography is wonderful and there's enough space for good moments.Never intelligent and memorable like the classic film, \"Exorcist II\" is just an easy entertainment to save you from a boring day. To some viewers it can be a decent film, to others it can be just like when Burton says about Regan's possession \"Horrible, horrible...but it's fascinating\". 6/10",

            "content": "Linda Blair reprises her role as Regan in \"The Exorcist II: The Heretic.\" Directed by John Boorman, the film finds everybody's favorite possessed little-girl growing up as a teen. Now under the care of a nurturing psychiatrist (Louise Fletcher) and Sharon (Kitty Winn), her live-in nanny from the first film, while her mother is away (a.k.a. Ellen Burstyn didn't want to do the flick), Regan leads a seemingly normal life until a priest (Richard Burton) sent to investigate the events of the first film shows up and stirs her inner demons. Slowly but surely, Regan becomes aware of some new-found powers and a connection to the past that leads the film into Africa, where it all began.Forever cursed as an inferior sequel, \"The Heretic\" is no doubt subpar compared to the first, but that's not to say that the film is not without its merits. Fact of the matter is that the film is host to several solid performances in its cast, most notably Linda Blair, who plays a very charming and very likable teenaged version of her signature character. Louise Fletcher, who had won an Oscar for playing the cruel and unusual Nurse Ratched in \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" one year prior, does a complete 180 and anchors the film with heart and compassion. Like Ellen Burstyn in the original, you believe she loves and has a bond with Regan. Richard Burton is solid as the troubled Father Lamont and you'll spot a young James Earl Jones as well as Max Von Sydow, also returning from the first film.The film's biggest problem is in its script, which, aside from not making sense at times, doesn't give its characters much to do. The first half of the film is fleshed out rather well and even takes the opportunity to dip into the past, almost like a prequel to the first (27 years later, two very mixed up prequels would emerge) but by the time the film reaches its conclusion, the story comes unraveled with an ending that flat out stinks and has little to no relevancy to the rest of the film. It's a shame, really, as some solid characters are established and the film seems bound and determined to destroy their credibility. The direction by Boorman can't be blamed. The man turns in a solid show and it is obviously the story \u2013 which was reportedly re-written five times, that serves as the film's downfall. Apparently, even in the 1970's, horror films fell victim to studio interference.While it attempts to reach the class of the original film, it ultimately fails. In the end, \"The Exorcist II: The Heretic\" is a film whose ideas are more interesting than its execution.

            "content": "\"Deliverance\" director John Boorman's \"The Exorcist 2: The Heretic,\" the sequel to William Friedkin's \"The Exorcist\" (1974), tries to be a metaphysical thriller rather than a cheap thrills gut-grabber of a horror movie like its predecessor. Not only does it fail to be as fascinating as the original, but it also fares worst as a sequel. Instead of intentionally thrilling us with insights about good and evil, \"The Heretic\" unintentionally spends more time making us laugh as its silliness. This is a shame when you consider the enormous talents squandered in Warner Brothers' production of this 118 minute monstrosity.Director John Boorman delivers little more than first-rate production values, including many cinematic innovations, which were squandered along with the talent in this $12.5 million stinker. The plot deals with Regan MacNeil (Linda Blair of \"The Exorcist\") four years after undergoing therapy with a shrink, Dr. Gene Tuskin (Louise Fletcher of \"Russian Roulette\") who uses a device which enables her to penetrate Regan's mind and determine if there are any scars left from the exorcism. Meanwhile, understandably disturbed by the death of the priest who exorcised Regan earlier, the Vatican dispatches Father Lamont (a lamenting Richard Burton of \"Where Eagles Dare\") to investigate the circumstances of the death of Father Merrin (Max Von Sydow). At first, because he feels unqualified, Lamont is reluctant. When he meets Regan, however, and confronts a vision of Evil, the challenge to pursue Evil to its source, to destroy it, and to purge himself as well as Regan obsesses him.In the screenplay by \"Generation\" scenarist William Goodhart, Father Lamont heads to Africa in search of the source of the Evil which Regan identifies as the Demon Pazuzu. What a name! After a tense build-up, you'd expect Boorman and company would offer us more than an ugly looking locust. That's right! The villain in \"The Exorcist 2: The Heretic\" turns out to be a dumb old grasshopper, and from the moment that you see this one grasshopper you know he's a fake and you want to laugh insanely out loud. \"The Exorcist 2: The Heretic\" emerges as a comedy of errors, complete with a tap-dancing musical interlude. Reportedly, Boorman re-edited the picture at least twice, but nothing could have saved this turkey.The problem with \"The Exorcist 2: The Heretic\" is that Boorman, Goodhart, and uncredited scenarist Rospo Pallenberg\u0097he adapted \"Excalibur\" never developed the suspense and therefore cannot involve audiences in this lifeless epic. Consequently, the film grinds on like it will never end, and then ends abruptly and unconvincingly. Along the way, Boorman drags in a scientific method to control Evil, while he uses a lot of leftover film footage from Mutual of Omaha's \"Wild Kingdom.\" Moreover, Boorman rarely brings in that nasty little which from the original, but when he does, she speaks so lady-like that you wonder if \"The Exorcist 2: The Heretic\" is an in-name only follow-up film. When he set out to helm this superficial, second-rate horror yarn, Boorman promised that he would not stoop to the vulgar tactics of the original Where \"The Exorcist\" was a negative and debasing experience, Boorman sought to make \"The Heretic\" into a redemptive and thought-provoking sequel. Clearly, Boorman wasn't the ideal choice as director. And in his effort to make a meaningful film out of what was to be remake of \"The Exorcist,\" Boorman has sunken even lower with a film that vomits claptrap philosophy, wastes a sterling cast, and teases its audience with never-to-be delivered horrors. Skip it!",

It often gets touted as one of the worst films ever made, but I was pleasantly surprised to see that it doesn't deserve that. It's a very different type of film to the first. The whole thing floats along in a dream-like, dissociative way, much like some of director John Boorman's other cool films (Excalibur etc), and the Nightmare on Elm Street films, I even wonder if this partially inspired them. It has its fair share of WTF / ridiculous scenes, but in an entertaining way more than bad.Visually it has some very eerie scenarios and weird ideas, especially in the elaborated Pazuzu lore and religious cults that Richard Burton discovers when he goes looking for James Earl Jones in Africa....yes the cast is that impressive!It certainly held my attention through-out, trying to decipher what all the imagery represented (whether it was successful or not in that regard). I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who likes more left-field films and old-school cinematography, every set was memorable with some kind of eye-catching details to look at.",

Cherubic Linda Blair seems to have lost whatever acting ability she exhibited in the first movie. She's 'all growed up' here, a fact director John Boorman wastes no time exploiting in her first scene where she bralessly jiggles her way through a tap dance number. Later scenes have her in a see-through nightgown and various tight tops. It's tacky but is anybody really surprised? Boorman's direction is at times interesting but he seems to forget that this is supposed to be a horror movie. The only thing scary or horrifying about this film is that it was even made. So many unintentionally funny scenes that it should be classified as a comedy. The synchronizer! Oh my god the synchronizer! This has to be seen to be believed. It's a turkey, for sure, but not one without some comical merits. Sadly, Paul Henreid's last film is so far removed from Casablanca it might as well have been shot on Mars.",

            "content": "EXORCIST II is one of the most confused & confusing films to review because there are some good aspects about it which have influenced movies up to this day but there's no denying that it's also ONE OF THE WORST FILMS EVER MADE!!! Here's a quick rundown of what's good, really bad and catastrophically ugly about it.The GOOD:The cinematography: It's really beautiful and lush!The visuals: There are some truly arresting visuals, certainly those in Africa with Max Von Sydow.The music: by the great Ennio Morricone.The production values: top notchThe atmosphere: Dream-like with a flair of Euro-cult feel to it! It almost feels like a Dario Argento film (Dario was probably influenced by this movie when he made PHENOMENA).\nThe really BAD:The acting: everyone is terrible. Linda Blair is the worst of the bunch.The script: it doesn't make much sense and it's pretty much pointless, certainly compared to the first movie. The characters are never defined and we never know anything about anyone. The dialogue: howlingly bad! Pazuzu! Kokumo! Kokumo! Pazuzu!The direction: I'm sure John Boorman's intentions for this sequel to the first blockbuster were honest. I'm certain he wanted to create this amazingly phantasmagoric horror film with over-the-top visuals and ideas. Unfortunately, not much of it works.\nThe catastrophically UGLY:Casting Richard Burton as a priest: one of the worst bits of casting ever. Burton doesn't look like a Catholic priest. He's looks like someone who had too much of a \"good\" life. Also, casting an actor who made movies in the 1940s, 1950s was wrong. They should have looked for someone who was more contemporary. The effect of having an old-fashion movie star Burton in a crazy contemporary dream-like horror film is jarring! It just doesn't work.The ending: after Burton finds Kokumo, what little sense or semblance of quality the movie vanish in a blink of an eye. When everyone heads back to the house where the first movie took place, the film is totally derailed beyond repair. It's really bad and makes me wonder what were they thinking. When we see evil Blair dressed up in Fredericks of Hollywood lingerie and vamping it out and trying to be sexy, the whole film (and even the first movie) is hurt by the extreme cheesiness of it all. The good thing about the first movie was the total lack of cheesiness about it. It felt authentic. Never \"Hollywoodish\". Well, not the ending of the sequel. If Evil Blair in EXORCIST II had remained like the ugly possessed one we saw in the first movie and not the sexy vampy one, the ending might have been a tad better but making Blair sexy in order to turn on celibate Burton is just too silly for words. The house falling apart and the swarm of locusts coming to Washington was okay but it added nothing to the whole thing. What's really funny is that with the car crashing in the fence, the house crumbling and the locusts swarm buzzing all about, you'd think some of the neighbors would have noticed something. Also, what happens to Regan and Father Lamont? Where do they go?The ending in EXORCIST II is truly bad and sends this John Boorman flick in the PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE category. It's the most unintentionally hilarious ending ever conceived for the silver screen.And it's a shame because as bad as the ending is, there are some startlingly original moments in the first hour which have actually influenced movies and filmmakers up to this day. The dream-like quality seen in EXORCIST II feels very contemporary and after watching it recently, it made me realise how influential that approach was. Unfortunately, the film is not really scary and the plethora of bad and disastrous aspects in EXORCIST II nearly eclipse the few good qualities it has.",

            "content": "This bizarre, much-maligned sequel to THE EXORCIST takes place four years after the original. Regan (Linda Blair) is now an art student living in New York City with her former nanny (Kitty Wynn) and making regular visits to her psychiatrist (Louise Fletcher). Meanwhile, Richard Burton is a priest supposedly on the verge of losing his faith who is assigned by the Vatican to investigate the death of Father Merrin (Max Von Sydow, who appears in flashbacks). Using a device straight out of a 50's sci-fi movie, which enables two people to see each other's thoughts, Fletcher and Burton attempt to see what is tormenting Blair, who has had nightmares since her possession years earlier. Burton learns that Blair is still in contact with the demon Pazuzu (named in the original EXORCIST book, but not the movie), and travels to Africa to find out more about it. He visits a witch doctor/scientist (James Earl Jones), who, as a boy, was possessed by Pazuzu as well. Back in New York, Fletcher doesn't believe a word of it, thinking it's all in Blair's head; meanwhile, Blair's memory of her ordeal slowly comes back to her. Burton comes back to NYC, where he and Blair use the mind-melding machine together.Burton, in a trance-like state, high-tails it to Georgetown, with Blair in tow, headed toward the original house. It all leads to a lively finale involving a swarm of locusts over Washington and a brutal wrestling match between Burton and Pazuzu (having taken on the likeness of Blair). This is one wacky movie, with enough plot twists and turns to make anyone dizzy. Director John Boorman goes for surrealism and metaphysics rather than green puke and spinning heads, which didn't go over well with most fans of the original. Add to that an incoherent screenplay (boasting a few of the most bewildering and awful lines of dialog in cinematic history) and wildly uneven performances (Fletcher and Blair sleepwalk through their parts, while Burton and Wynn chew the scenery relentlessly), and you've got a movie that doesn't fare well with critics, fans or much of anyone. Another problem is that the movie never establishes exactly who \"the heretic\" of the title is! Burton? Von Sydow? Blair?All of this is unfortunate, because there are some good points to the movie. William Fraker's photography is gorgeous, and mixed with some excellent special effects creates some spectacular and striking imagery. A swarm of locusts ravaging an African plain, then later flying past the Capital Building in Washington, DC are breath-taking moments. Ennio Morricone's music score is also a plus. Overall, THE HERETIC is an underrated movie that still isn't very good. But after years of carbon copy sequels with little or no ambition other than box office success, it's worth a look. The end result may be a disaster, but you have to admire Boorman and company for trying something different.",

Next to her comes the veteran Richard Burton, in the role of an unconvincing Catholic priest. In fact, he was already drowned in alcoholism in the same way that Blair might no longer be unknown to drugs. There is no merit in the support cast, no use talking. The script should have been used as toilet paper before the movie was shot. Everything that could be stuck in the film ended up appearing, invariably ridiculous, forced and pitiful: from obvious allusions to the hippies (watch costumes, for example) to an absurd story involving an African tribe, not to mention that box with strobe lights which left the person hypnotized. To make the salad more complete only the aliens and medieval knights were lacking. Can we offer this film to Pazuzu, to see if he takes the movie away for good?",

Then a priest (Richard Burton!) comes to believe the demon that possessed Regan is still lurking inside her waiting to come out.This was a legendary fiasco when it came out in 1977.

I KNEW this was going to be a disaster when director John Boorman made it clear it was NOT a horror film! Ummmmmm...what did he think he was doing? \"Gone With the Wind\"? It's not scary in the slightest and the story wanders all over the place. Some of the cinematography is beautiful (that's why I'm giving it two stars) but everything else is lousy. There are scenes in Africa that are slow and boring and I'm still not quite sure what the locusts have to do with anything. And the name of the demon is Pazuzu. Seriously. WHO thought that up???

Many people consider this film to be the worst movie sequel ever made. I didn't think \"Exorcist II\" was that bad, but it's nowhere near as good as its predecessor. Linda Blair returns as Regan, the girl who was possessed by the Devil in the original 1973 classic. Here she's still bothered by the horrible things that happened to her when she was living in Georgetown, Washington D.C. Fearing that the demon will possess her once again, psychiatrist Louise Fletcher and priest Richard Burton try to help her while Burton wants to find out what happened to Father Merrin (Max Von Sydow), the ill-fated priest who tried to exorcise the foul-mouthed demon out of Regan in the first movie. Some scenes in \"Exorcist II: The Heretic\" are interesting. Some are preposterous. Much of the dialogue is laughable (especially Burton's continuous ramblings about \"evil\"), and parts of the movie don't make sense. The special effects are good, and Ennio Morricone's music score is very effective (It would have been nice if they could have replayed the eerie \"Tubular Bells\" theme from the first film). But I think the main problem with \"Exorcist II: The Heretic\" is that it's not real scary. \"The Exorcist\" was a film that scared the pants off of me when I first saw it, and after seeing it again recently on the big screen, I was still jolted by many of its disturbing images as well as one new one (the \"spiderwalk\"). This film is pretty much devoid of chills and that's disappointing. Also, the performances here aren't as strong as they were in the first one. But I give the filmmakers credit for trying something different instead of doing a retread of the original. I think \"Exorcist II: The Heretic\" needed a better script.

Regularly visiting a children's hospital, she somehow gets hooked up onto this \"synchronizer\" machine where a doctor can somehow enter her subconscious or something along those lines. But now, Pasuzu has returned, and is tormenting Regan all over again.I haven't seen this film in awhile, but I don't think it was anything too special. The whole \"synchronizer\" premise to the film was pretty far fetched, and apparently the crowd used to test screen the film found the movie to be awful after that element was introduced. I don't completely agree, I think that concept isn't very realistic and a bit ridiculous, but in the context of the movie they somehow manage to make it work. The biggest problem with this movie is the absence of Ellen Burstyn, who gave a remarkable performance in the original film as Regan's mother. Linda Blair is back though, and she is a very good actress, so she gave a good performance. Richard Burton who played the priest in this film was also very good as was Louise Fletcher, who plays a guidance counselor. One of the good qualities to this film, however, was the flashback sequences to Father Merrin's time spent in Africa, which had some really distinctive visuals. Although, I think the back story was a little bit bizarre and unneeded, but whatever.Overall, I didn't think \"Exoricst II: The Heretic\" was a complete waste of time, and I think some people were a little harsh on it. It's not nearly as good as the original movie was, it is below average, but watchable at the least. Far from perfect, but still decent enough.

Father Lamont discovers that the demon Pazuzu is still within Regan, Lamont also sees an African witchdoctor named Kokumo (Joey Green) who has the natural ability to defeat Pazuzu...Co-written, produced & directed by John Boorman this was the follow up to William Friedkin's controversial & successful classic The Exorcist (1973) & what a complete total & utter mess it is too. Upon it's initial release The Exorcist II: The Heretic was absolutely trashed by critics & audiences alike, Warner Bros. & Boorman pulled the film from theatres at least twice to reedit it & it exists in a few different versions including the original studio cut that was released to theatres & on video in the early 80's which ran for about 100 minutes, the 120 odd minute director's cut which is the one most commonly available now on DVD & the one I will be basing my comments on along with further different versions aired on TV & released in Japan which are significantly different enough to warrant a mention. Anyway, the script by William Goodhart & an uncredited Boorman with Rospo Pallenberg is a real mess from start to finish, it's incredible how a big budget major Hollywood studio financed film could turn out to be such a disaster but the Exorcist II: The Heretic is living proof. Apparently the film underwent several major rewrites which obviously didn't help things & the film feels like a mixed bag of unrelated ideas which were all thrown together without any regard for continuity or the audiences enjoyment. To be honest I don't really understand the story as it is, I don't know why the makers just didn't give us more of the same, more of what made the original Exorcist such an effective horror flick. The whole notion of the synchroniser machine which lets people share thoughts & feelings is just ridiculous & is taken so seriously it becomes unintentionally funny & don't even start me on the whole 'good locust' thing, the dialogue is awful, the story is bizarre & makes little sense & the makers just disregard everything that made the original such a success. For me Exorcist II: The Heretic was like a car crash, I know I shouldn't look at it but I couldn't help myself in a morbid masochistic sort of way.Director Boorman has made a real mess of this, there's nothing scary in it at all & at times it doesn't even feel like a horror film that much. At almost 2 hours (the widely available director's cut that has been released on DVD) it felt like it went on forever, nothing of any real interest happens & it has absolutely zero momentum as it randomly shifts back & forwards between America & Africa. Some of the special effects are reasonably impressive, the scenes where the camera seems to follow a single locust in close-up are very, very impressive as is some of the African cinematography. Unfortunately flying locusts just aren't that scary or interesting & there's no blood or gore apart from a ripped out heart & Regan only appears possessed for a very short period at the end. Apparently actress Linda Blair refused to wear Dick Smith's possessed make-up again so a double was used, who the hell does she think she is Joan Collins?!With a supposed budget of about $14,000,000 this was the most expensive film Warner Bros. had made to that point, it's well made I suppose but a bit lifeless & bland. Actors David Carradine, Jack Nicholson & Christopher Walken were all considered for the role of Father Lamont while Jon Voight had agreed to play him but dropped out due to concerns over the screenplay which is fair enough I suppose & now seems like a pretty good call. The acting is pretty poor which makes it even worse to sit through & Blair has stated that Burton would turn on set drunk.Exorcist II: The Heretic is a bit of an embarrassment all round for everyone involved, there really isn't much here to enjoy unless your your a fan of bad films. Followed by The Exorcist III (1990), Exorcist: The Beginning (2004) & the reworked Dominion: Prequel to the Exorcist (2005) although ironically considered by most as better films none of which were anywhere near as successful as Exorcist II: The Heretic despite it's terrible reputation...",

When going deep within hypnosis, interlocking thought and mind with Reagan, Father Lamont discovers a possible Voodoo Priest Komumo(James Earl Jones)who has power over Pazuzu. Lamont will seek out Komumo, against The Church's order to break away from a case where he was only to investigate the reasons behind the mysterious death of Father Merrin(Max Von Sydow), in the hopes of joining together to defeat Satan's angel and save Reagan from certain future horror.Louise Fletcher portrays Dr. Gene Tuskin, Reagan's doctor in charge of seeing that Reagan gets proper psychiatric care. She invented the tacky, wacky hypnosis machine with it's strobe light and mechanical sound. She is a scientist and simply will not accept that Reagan has some sort of supernatural evil buried within(in a startling sequence where she is interlinked with Reagan, Pazuzu almost kills her gripping her heart in it's evil grasp).I will not take up for the film overall, because I think it's crap like the majority, but will give credit to William A Fraker for his stunning cinematography and the great Ennio Morricone for his eerie, spine-tingling score which brings an atmosphere to this wretched exercise it really doesn't deserve. The dialogue and acting is anything but great and Burton looks embarrassed(I read that the only reason he'd even accept this role was that he'd get the lead psychiatrist role in Sidney Lumet's marvelous, \"Equus\")to even be in it. Fletcher has her bright career moments, but doesn't spark or even glimmer in her role. She's like an actress just starting out trying to remember her lines. All this could be because they do not believe in the material and no inspiration seems to be in the story either where we follow ESP and Voodoo mumbo jumbo, not to mention we actually \"ride\" on the wings of a locust in a dream as Burton's Lamont is being led by Pazuzu to the Voodoo Priest within Reagan's hypnotic state.The final climactic showdown is merely the tip of the iceberg in that it is a noisy, ridiculous, special-effects laden incoherent mess which leaves the viewer(..or at least me)feeling like they do not know what just happened. It's derivative and laughable and closes the door on the fact that this film couldn't be saved from being a laughingstock and disappointing considering those involved.",

Her presence is negligible at best, resulting in more of a superficial, extended cameo appearance.Louise Fletcher plays Regan's daffy psychiatrist, using her \"synchronizer\" machine (!!) to link minds with Regan, so she can relive her past.

            "content": "When The Exorcist managed to cram patrons into seats despite its rather adult-oriented nature, Warner Brothers were quick to develop a sequel. Unfortunately, most of those involved in the original did not want a bar of the sequel, and so a new director plus screenwriter had to be hired. According to estimates, fourteen million 1977 dollars were spent on this sequel. At that time, it was the single most expensive film that Warners had put together. Nowadays, the film is a staple of the bad film culture, with sites devoting masses of space to mocking the results. Oddly enough, the film supposedly made a profit at the box office, but not enough of one to compare with its (overrated) predecessor. Certainly not enough to even draw comparison to the surprise hit that Fox and Lucasfilm cooked up together that year. But Exorcist II was not without its impact. Blair's career, such as it was, never recovered, and writer William Goodhart was only able to sell one more screenplay three years later.Linda, for her part, acts very solidly with material that not even the worst soap opera star should have to endure. According to what she has said, Richard Burton started out sober on the film, but progressively became more and more intoxicated as the film rolled on. Perhaps he saw the impact this monstrosity would have on his career and decided to drown his sorrows in advance. The scenes with the so-called synchroniser, a piece of film prop designed to go down in infamy, make it all too clear the actors knew they were making crap. These sequences, in which a mass of ignorance regarding psychiatry and hypnosis is displayed, will probably haunt Goodhart and director John Boorman for all eternity. Granted, portraying these concepts in film was at a childish level then, but even audiences of the late 1970s knew better than to not mock this rubbish. Apparently, the reaction from the audience at the premiere was so strong that Boorman cut seven minutes out of the film in the hopes it would go over better. Since none of those seven minutes involve the \"synchroniser\"... well, you get the idea.Especially funny is a moment when Regan prompts an autistic girl to speak to her. Maybe in America, the concept of not being able to speak was linked with autism, but in today's world where individuals who could speak and read at adult levels when toddling are finding out they are on the spectrum, it just adds more to the unintentional comedy factor. Also adding to the fun are scenes in which Richard Burton is wandering around in what appears to be Africa, trying to make sense of scenes in which few, if any, of his castmates speak English. Maybe these scenes are where future producers got the idea for the Wookiee sequences in the Star Wars Holiday Special. It is clear that these scenes saw the beginning of Burton's decision to give up and drink his way through the film. James Earl Jones signs up for the Embarrassed Actor league in this film, informing Burton at one point that if Pazuzu comes for him, he (Jones) will spit a leopard. I only wish I were making that up. Just as well for him that his other project in 1977 associated him with the most fearsome villain the big screen ever saw.This explains why Jones is the only alumni from Exorcist II to have ever enjoyed solid, uninterrupted work since 1977. One can put him in a bad film, but he will rise to the occasion of making his character among the most memorable. Its just unfortunate that he is swimming against the tide of a film that attempts to create a conflict between a monotheistic god and the science that is the source of all improvement in the human condition that has occurred during the past hundred or so years. Is the implication of the previously-mentioned scene meant to be that this god can cure autism? Maybe the autistic civil rights movement is only getting started some thirty years after this crock was released, but that does not make the fact that those of us on the spectrum who can speak for ourselves will not be hesitant to tell this normalistic god where he can put his cure. While I am thinking of it, I do not wish to understand what acting in this film must have done to the eyes of its cast. With my hypersensitive vision, every scene with the \"synchroniser\" is giving me a rotten headache.Translate all of the above to the following. Many things have been blamed for the critical failure of Exorcist II, but the party most at fault is the script. Goodhart throws a ton of mystical concepts from faith healing to voodoo (or whatever they are trying to demonstrate in this film) at the viewer, and the sad fact is that none of it sticks. Put simply, the film cannot make up its mind what it wants to be. In some moments, it even gives the impression of copping the X-Men comic books of the era, and not very well at that. The bad writing even extends into individual reactions that make no sense in context of the action and situation that prompts them. I realise this is unrelated to the writing, but the back projections for scenes in cars are also downright hilarious. Would it really have been that expensive to shoot in a real car, driving down a real street? Or to make gates that look like they are made from real iron and stone for that matter? Nothing in the film is convincing, and it almost makes one feel sad for the human element. Almost.For that reason, more than anything, I gave Exorcist II a one out of ten. If stupidity is currency in Hollywood, then the makers of Exorcist II are analogous to Donald Trump.",

Yes, Sir Richard Burton was a great actor--yet when shoehorned with a crappy script and with his more irritating peccadilloes left unrestrained, he can be such a chore and bore to watch. Though I have not seen the two more recent 'prequels' for the 'Exorcist' franchise, I can safely say that while 'Exorcist II' is not the worst horror movie ever made (that, by the way, never seemed its intention), it's certainly the worst of the original trilogy--and by a country mile.

One scene, as Fletcher's plugged into Regan's mind and relives the death of Father Merrin, is intense: mostly thanks to Fletcher's acting.And any part involving Regan's attempts to remain a normal kid as the demon closes in (or perhaps he's there already) are comfortable \u2013 it's great seeing the character all grown up, allowing Linda Blair to use her own voice for the entire trip.But as a horror film it's not a bit scary \u2013 nor are their any effective moments of suspense. Although the finale has potential: as Burton and Blair literally put their minds together to destroy the demon once and for all.

When I finally got around to viewing it my expectations were as low as they could be. Described by many as the worst sequel of all time and some call it the worst movie ever made. I would not go that far. But one thing's for sure; It's not good.What Boorman and co. were exactly trying to do with the flick is puzzling. It's not a horror movie, it seems to be trying to be a psychological thriller but it fails completely. In fact, there is no suspense to be found at all. Haphazard editing and a confusing (read: rather shitty) script ruin all chances of atmosphere and suspense. The dialogue is very silly as well.Acting is OK I thought. Richard Burton is not all bad. Most reviewers trash his performance and accuse him and Linda Blair of not being able to pull off a single scene together convincingly. I think he does pretty well under the circumstances. As does Louise Fletcher in a horribly written role. This quality actress has never found a decent role since One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. Linda Blair, Max Von Sydow and James Earl Jones perform decently but the material lets them down.Big plus also for the cinematography and overall look. The film may be trash, but it's a well filmed trash. Exterior shots in Africa look quite nice, some interesting color schemes throughout and the artsy look on many scenes look great. The music by Ennio Morricone is nothing short of fantastic, much better than the film deserves.The main problem is that this flick doesn't make any sense. Where it's going is never clear and when it's over you still don't have a clue. Originally Exorcist II was a three hour feature which (reportedly) made some sense but Boorman had to chop it down by a third. I don't know if there's a masterpiece buried in the film archives somewhere but I seriously doubt it. But I do believe that everyone involved had some point to make which simply got completely lost.After reading countless reviews claiming this as one of the worst films of all time I can't say I was bored to death as my expectations were very low.

Father Lamont works on helping Regan, but unfortunately finds it extremely hard. To help with his mission to help Regan, Lamont travels to Africa to gain knowledge from Kokumo, who he had previously exorcised the same demon. Will Father Lamont be able to help Regan MacNeil? I saw the original 'The Exorcist' and was quite optimistic about its sequel. Unfortunately I was very disappointed with this. The characters were OK, but I just found the story just so dragged out and slightly boring. The action and interesting areas of the story didn't really happen, until you reached the end, and then it was too late. I was actually watching this film, whilst wanting it to hurry up and finish. I only decided to stick with it, so I can actually say I've watched. This is a very, very bad sequel to a truly terrifying film. \"Be joined with us, Father.\" - Regan MacNeil (Linda Blair)",

The problem is that the story seems to go around in several directions without ever knowing to which point to go.At times it seems a drama, in others a psychological trhiller and in others a, do not know, musical? Anyway, seeing Linda Blair back is interesting, because she has become a very beautiful and sexy woman, (often cleavage), but her presence is not enough to lift the flight of a film that sinks irretrievably, for a single but Unforgivable error, which does not cause fear, and being the Exorcist, as it costs to swallow it.In summary:The best: Linda Blair, growing and distilling a morbid almost mortal, the sequences in Africa with Max Von Sidow, the best of the film, his technical bill, umm Richard Burton ?.The Worst: It does not scare, without more.",

While the last film was long, at least it had more action in it, while this being a couple of minutes shorter, is mostly filled with talky talk moments in & is plain boring, which in itself makes this sequel even more pointless than it already was.It's no surprise the film is boring twice as much given its 1 hour & 50 minute runtime & dragged out to breaking point pacing.

The first film was one of the best films ever made in my opinion, but this one is easily one of the worst films ever produced.  The plot is totally incomprehensible, but I will try to give a little insight.  Linda Blair is now a 17-year old girl who is helping out other young children who have psychological problems.  Psychologist Louise Fletcher wants to know just how much Blair remembers from the exorcism of the original.  Blair swears she does not remember much of anything.  Enter priest Richard Burton who is also curious of the circumstances of Blair's ordeal.  Burton fears that an evil demon spirit named Pazuzu is the one that originally possessed Blair and thinks that he is trying to re-possess her to take over the world. We see a disjointed history of the original exorcist, Max Von Sydow, and his struggles in Africa with the first exorcism he performed.  The young boy who he saved is now James Earl Jones, a scientist in Africa who has amazing insight on insects.  Pazuzu's main form of transportation has been insects and they are the catalysts to his very existence on Earth.  Burton goes to Africa and learns that the only way for Blair to be free of Pazuzu forever is to meet him at her old house in Georgetown.  Of course she agrees and we see that Blair's character is a powerful person who is very special in many ways.  That is just a small sliver of the terrible screenplay which tries to add new wrinkles to the original.  This film was little more than a project to generate revenue for Warner Bros.  William Peter Blatty had nothing to do with the screenplay and William Friedkin refused to direct knowing that a sequel would be difficult to pull off without Blatty (boy was he right!). Thus the studio got English film-maker John Boorman (\"Deliverance\") to co-write and direct.  His vision of the franchise was so outlandish and confusing that the best director would have had no luck with this film.  The fact that the first was such a hit brought him established actors like Burton, Fletcher, Jones, and Ned Beatty (in a very short cameo) to be in the film.  However, I cannot imagine Blair, Von Sydow, and Kitty Winn saying yes to this project.  I guess they felt that they had a can't-miss film on their hands.  They were sorely mistaken.  The fact that Boorman decided to pull the film from theaters when it was first released, so he could re-cut the film, did not help matters any either.  Turkey (0 out of 5 stars).",

He reedited it, cutting eight minutes in hopes of getting the story (written by William Goodhart) to the point of coherency, to no avail. The film remains a kind of reverse gold standard for sequels. It's still a ridiculously overacted, although at times visually haunting, movie. Richard Burton stars as a troubled priest (something of a specialty of his) who is brought in to follow up on the case of Linda Blair, who is institutionalized, still troubled by her encounter with the devil (who wouldn't be?).

Sure, the film is by no means great, but it runs competently enough especially compared to other film sequels in the genre and by no means feels like it should be labelled things such as \"Worst Film Ever\".There is a decent soundtrack to this film and there are some nice visual shots and locations and everything cuts and flows nicely. The acting and direction are not dreadful, although a little shaky at times. It feels like it has some of the main ingredients to making a good horror film. However the storyline itself lets it down, as well as the film not actually being scary. It would be almost impossible for the sequel to one of the most controversial films of all time to be just as good. But it seems expectations are unrealistic.Firstly, the whole idea of the hypnosis machine was ludicrous. At one point Father Lamont and the doctor were plugged into Regan's thoughts via the machine when Regan herself was not. Also there was no need to give Regan supernatural healing powers or for there to be a Regan double. In fact Regan herself is not the real victim here and is shown that despite the possession to be walking around with no problems, it does not seem like the same demon from the first film. , and the whole locust thing is a bit lame. I guess you could argue that these points are why this is a terrible film but they merely make it an OK film. I have seen this film twice now and I was slightly entertained. There is some cheesy dialogue in the film, my favourite probably being the one quoted at the start, but I do not feel anything about this film embarrasses itself. It is alright to kill some time. Some points are quite funny but not over the top like in Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2, and nowhere near as bad as some other horror films.My advice is, if you like horror sequels then this is a competent run through of a well known story and is worth watching if you are wanting to watch every film in the franchise, topped off with a nice soundtrack.If you are not really a fan of this sort of thing, but you loved The Exorcist and are hoping for the same thrills you got from watching that film, you will not find it here.Rating: 5.",

            "content": "Considering the astonishing success of 1973's \"The Exorcist,\" a sequel didn't seem like a bad idea. However, this one, as delivered up by director Boorman, certainly was! Several years have passed by since Blair was possessed by the Devil and subsequently exorcised by priest Von Sydow (who was killed for his efforts.) Now the Vatican is sending priest Burton to investigate the matter and he finds Blair living with her guardian Wynn and receiving treatment from therapist Fletcher at Fletcher's ludicrous clinic at which children spend their days rolling a massive padded lug nut around the room. (Blair's mother, played by Ellen Burstyn in the original film, is briefly alluded to as being out of the country, the actress wisely having avoided this project altogether.) Almost directly after explaining to Burton that Blair shouldn't be reminded of her experience, Fletcher hooks her up to a device that is designed to hypnotize her into doing exactly that! As a result of this (ridiculous) contraption, it is discovered that Blair was possessed by an evil spirit that had previously and subsequently done the same to other people, notably an African boy. Burton sets off to speak to the now-grown victim (played by Jones) and experiences a variety of strange experiences. Meanwhile (in one of the film's howling moments), as Burton is mistreated by the locals, Blair incurs his injuries, stigmatically, right while she's in the middle of a putridly hideous school revue tap dance!! Somehow it all winds up back in Blair's old bedroom, with the demon in a sexualized form of Blair (she refused to wear the ghoulish makeup this time out) coming on to the craggy Burton while Wynn and Fletcher endure a wrangled taxi crash downstairs! Locusts, a motif throughout the film for vaguely specified reasons, descend on the scene in droves until the \"big finish.\" Burton, probably considered a bit of a casting coup despite his decayed appearance and questionable career path by then, alternates between stone-faced apathy and over-the-top hamminess. Blair, pneumatically filled out in all the right places by now, especially in her chest and in her chipmunk cheeks, is really horrible. She was exerting as much control as she could, based on the status of her career to that point and the need for her presence in the film, and she got what was coming to her when the film was greeted with peals of laughter upon release. Her career never rebounded, especially when the other shoe (\"Roller Boogie\") dropped. Fletcher, in a role that was written for a man and ought to have stayed as such since the film comes off as oddly female heavy, seems to be trying to convey feeling into her part, but it's a rotten role and she frequently comes off badly. Wynn's part, clearly augmented to make up for Burstyn's absence, makes little sense. Von Sydow appears briefly in flashbacks as a younger version of the character he played in the original. Jones' role is small, but not as small as Beatty's (apparently working as a favor to Boorman following their \"Deliverance\" collaboration?) and Henreid adds a degree of presence as a Cardinal. Beatty's real life wife has a part as one of Fletcher's assistants and Plato appears as an autistic child mysteriously aided by Blair. Despite some striking imagery, the film fails because it is muddled, wrong-headed, not in any way scary and ultimately quite ridiculous. This being the era of the all-star disaster film, a number of destructive elements and effects are introduced along the way (check out the lady behind Fletcher on the plane who hits her head!), but the biggest disaster of all is the script. And people are still scratching their heads over the subtitle of the film!",

Bloody hell.Linda Blair looks gorgeous here, and her performance is fine, but she has nothing to work with. Richard Burton however, appears to be either genuinely under hypnosis, drunk, or bored with everything involved and wanting desperately to get this over with so he can go somewhere else, as there are repeated occasions when he doesn't even wait for the person to whom he is speaking to finish their lines, before interrupting them.Surreal images of someone rolling a giant bolt through this hall of mirrors/ psychiatric offices, and a demon, Pazuzu, who looks strangely like Aunt Jemima, and Linda Blair's attractive body on constant display give this a very random, surreal, Italian giallo vibe at times, but the entire thing quickly collapses under its own weight, never to recover.

Sadly, now that she is older, her inability to act can not be accused on her being a child. Very young she still is but talent stems from a young age and watching her in this, i can expect she stars in TV roles after this.I could write a novel on how many scenes and shots will make you laugh but like any bad film, laughter tends to be the prime reaction from the audience. Is there anything worthwhile to mention? It's interesting in parts. The back-story of Father Merrin and his initial exorcism on the African kid is intriguing but unlike Father Karris, Father Lamont personal quest on discovering himself and his beliefs is so uninteresting that the whole film collapses.

John Boorman took a high brow/psedo intellectual route by making a movie with esoteric themes, but is actually low on substance and has nothing to really reel in the viewer to care about all the crap that is going on here. John Boorman's pretentious vision is nothing more than an artist whipping out his penis and masturbating on the canvas, then presenting it as a piece of art.

            "content": "Having a terrible stigma of being one of the worst follow ups to a horror classic, film critics and fans alike, have torn The Heretic apart for many years. Exorcist II does warrant this criticism but has some features done right by the director and producers. Let's start off by saying the film does have a poorly, mindless written plot along with a lot of the scenes being rather dull. The hypnosis machine and traveling within minds is a laughable and lazy attempt to add an \"interesting\" futuristic feel. Another fail is the scenes in Africa, which don't really make a whole lot of sense and add very little to Regan's story. Frightening moments and death scenes were very limited too.With a hefty list of negative aspects to the film, one thing done right was casting previous major players, Linda Blair as Regan, Max von Sydow as Merrin, and Kitty Winn as Sharon. The lead roles of Louise Fletcher and Richard Burton were also solid additions and put forth a good character. Perhaps the biggest get was Ennio Morricone on the side of composing the film's music which was fantastic during the introduction's credits. All in all, the film was a below mediocre project to one of the most notorious horror films and should probably be skipped, as the first and third are better suited together.",

            "review_title": "One Of The Most Anticipated Sequels Ever Bombs",
            "content": "Not long after the success of the original film, several of the makers of The Exorcist tried to plot a workable sequel. After an earnest attempt, they abandoned the idea. This included director William Friedkin, writer William Peter Blatty, and actress Ellen Burstyn. Several reviewers have rationalized there's an entertaining film hiding inside of this highly anticipated sequel to The Exorcist, but the truth of the matter is there isn't. Father Lamont is called upon to investigate the death of Father Merrin from the original film. In so doing, he manipulates his way into Doctor Tuskin's office, who is providing some experimental treatment to a teenage Regan.Richard Burton, although obviously not in one of his better roles, is the best thing in the film as Father Lamont, until near the end of the film when Regan (Linda Blair) seduces him momentarily. Max Von Sydow appears briefly as Father Merrin again. Louise Fletcher, in her first film since her Oscar-winning Cuckoo's Nest turn as Nurse Ratched, is Doctor Tuskin, some sort of mumbo jumbo psychiatrist. The plot has Regan, Doctor Tuskin, and Father Lamont taking turns with a neural device called \"the synchronizer\" which transports the participant into a hypnotic/dreamlike state. Here, the viewer (and the participant opposite Regan) sees the point of view of Regan and the dreams that supposedly still haunt her. In retrospect, the device is laughably phony and as dated as the high waist pants sported by Linda Blair, Louise Fletcher, and Kitty Winn, who returns as Sharon Spencer. Like the first film, The Heretic begins earnestly enough with a nice visual metaphor of Father Lamont meeting Regan, viewing her through a darkly tinted glass door. However, as soon as \"the synchronizer\" appears, the film loses some credibility. Clearly, the audience comes to a sequel like this to be scared, not to go on a metaphysical travelogue. The high rise apartment Regan lives in is wasted too. Why have a high rise setting in a horror film, if you're not going to exploit for its worth? The IV pole is back again; only this time, Regan pulls out the IV, which is clearly not flowing, and then the IV pole disappears in subsequent shots. After a half hour, the anticipation builds for the first set of shocks which never comes. After an hour, interest begins to wane, and after ninety minutes, it becomes a chore to sit through the remainder of the film, realizing the film is vastly inferior to the original, has no suspense or horror, and isn't even a passable film at all. Linda Blair does the film no favors with the limited scenes she has. She's always in scenes with other actors, and she's always the weakest actor/actress in the film. Watch her reaction as she enters her old bedroom from the first film, and viewers will see what I mean. She screams/yells, but the expression on her face never changes from the neutral affect she enters the room with. She's a major liability in this production. That's right. The film ends where the horror began in the first film: Regan's bedroom. The seduction scene with Father Lamont is laughable and simply attempts to throw a shock at viewers when there hasn't been any up until that time. Reportedly, Boorman pulled the film from release and reedited it not once but twice to no avail. The film garnered a strong negative audience reaction and never recovered critically. It remains one of the most disappointing sequels in motion picture history. Mercedes McCambridge is sorely missed. James Earl Jones and Ned Beatty appear briefly in small roles. This was prominent 1940-1950's actor Paul Henreid's final film. * of 4 stars.",

            "content": "The 1974 original is hands down my favourite movie of the 70\u2032s and probably my favourite horror movie of all time, but I never saw the sequels as I heard only bad press. So when while trawling the weekly horror rack I spotted the Exorcist 2 I thought why not? Now that I have seen it I can tell you why YOU shouldn't bother.Following on about 4 years from the events of the first film we find Linda Blair back as Regan, who is either delusional or simply in denial about her previous demonic possession, though she still frequently visits a psychiatric practise with several other patients.An early highlight is a meeting with a fellow patient which results in the following exchange: Patient - \"What's wrong with you?\" Regan - \"I was possessed by a demon. It's OK he's gone.\" What cracked me up is the light and breezy way she says the above, almost like she was saying \"Looks like rain, don't worry I've got an umbrella.\" Anyway plot: Richard Burton is Father Lamont, a priest commissioned to look into the events of Regan's exorcism, in particular the death of Father Merrin, who reappears in flashback and whose reputation had come into question as a result. After Lamont gets too involved in Regan's situation he is removed from the \"case\" and goes to Africa to find another boy possessed by the demon (now named Axui-Xui \"ah-zoo-zoo\") to discover more..... and hilarity ensues.Without spoilers, Lamont and Regan can share visions by putting on headbands with cords attached to nothing and looking at a cheesy disco strobe light and speaking slowly.In the very first usage of what they call \"synchronised hypnosis\" Regan's doctor goes into shock and Lamont simply picks up the headband and without ever using the thing before is able to drag her out. After which the event is never spoken of again! One more clumsy exchange featuring the \"spirit\" (apparently piloting a helicopter and buzzing wild animals) later and off goes the plot into whatever is required to set up some pretty awkward scenes that I am sure the director felt would be coo-oooollllll. My favourite recurring motif is that of the \"hover-locust\", literally a locust that is able to furiously beat its wings without advancing.The less said about the finale the better, I really had no idea of what was supposed to be happening, who was in danger and what was real or a flashback. It just seemed they ran out of ideas and noisy and confusing means scary, not just noisy and confusing.This movie is the poster child of why a good movie sometimes should be allowed to stand on its own, without being soiled by dodgy sequels. I can't believe that quality actors signed up for this rubbish. Richard Burton! Max Von Sydow!! James Earl Jones!?! The special effects are pretty dodgy but that is probably more a by-product of the film being made in 1977.My biggest criticism, and the harshest I can render on any flick, is that it achieve its primary purpose. A comedy should at least be funny, an action flick should have some action and a horror movie should be scary. Obvious right? The only time I got scared of this movie was when I checked the time and realised there was 25 minutes still to go.Finally the director should be ashamed for sexing up Linda Blair, who was about 16 or so when filming, the first shot has her jiggling about in a crop top and it is obvious that the costume department didn't have room in the budget for a bra! I hate a lot of films, this one is so boring I couldn't summon the passion to even care. I can't come up with anything worse really.Final Rating - 3 / 10.

I have seen a whole lot worse. I think what the major problem is pertains to high expectations and low achievement. Nonetheless, Exorcist II: the Heretic is an entertaining film to degrees and though it is definitely a bad film - a film I found humorous for all the wrong reasons. Taking Richard Burton seriously as a priest is just one of the many problems the film has. Burton gives one of his typical performances but is competent in front of the camera. Academy award winner Louise Fletcher also is there to give varying degrees of credibility. The biggest problem is easily the muddled mess of a script. I saw the film and could not really explain what happened competently. I know that Regan is back and she still has the subconscious memories of what happened years ago. In order to exorcise these memories Burton goes to Africa to find James Earl Jones who is connected with a locust demon(?) Anywy the story sucks. But Boorman and his cast wend their way through the material and at the very least put something together that makes a little sense and is a bit of fun. I wasn't bored, and for me the worst thing a movie can be is boring. There are some powerful scenes in this film. I enjoyed SOME of the footage of Burton going to Africa. The opening scene of him exorcising a demon was well-shot. Max Von Sydow is back ala flashback. And last but certainly not least, Linda Blair returns giving a pretty good performance and looking quite beautiful and sexy.

You might be surprised to hear this, but I'd still recommend seeing EXORCIST II: THE HERETIC, and especially if you enjoyed the original; it's such a jaw-droppingly awful abomination that you need to see it in order to believe it. What the hell were they all thinking? How do you follow up one of the scariest and most powerful box office horror classics with this type of garbage? You know you're in a heap of trouble when you've got actors like Richard Burton, Louise Fletcher and James Earl Jones and it turns out to be Kitty Winn (as Sharon) who gives the only credible performance. Linda Blair is terrible as Regan too, but nobody was expecting anything earth shattering from her anyway. It's so much fun to trash this movie. There are so many areas to tear apart that one doesn't know where to begin. The \"script\" is utterly implausible and plays like the stuff born out of a bad acid trip where someone fried his mind the night before, wrote the film while tripping under the notion that he's found the key to life itself, and then awakens the next morning in a pool of vomit with no recollection and just a piece of paper with chicken scratch that he can't even read himself. There doesn't seem to be any point to the goings-on, and whatever plot can be surmised at all is ludicrous and confusing. The film is dumb, pointless, boring, badly acted, abysmally directed, and NON-FRIGHTENING. Idiotic dialogue abounds everywhere (\"Kokumo\"? \"Pazuzu\"?) and the music score from the great Ennio Morricone is stillborn.I've mentioned the poor acting, but I must devote a paragraph alone to Louise Fletcher (who had just won the Best Actress award for ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST). She takes top honors as Worst Performer, even over Linda Blair. It's entrancing how ineffective and disinterested Fletcher appears throughout this film, delivering her lines as though she hasn't slept in a week. Yet another sign that director John Boorman was asleep at the wheel himself, or maybe a revelation that Miss Fletcher could never \"really\" act at all; her listless delivery makes me wonder if her emotionless nurse from CUCKOO'S NEST was not so much an Oscar worthy performance as it was Louise Fletcher just being herself. That about covers it. The best thing that can be said for this turd is that some flashes of the cinematography are stronger than it deserves.

            "content": "I speak a lifelong and devoted lover of The Exorcist, not mere the greatest 'horror' movie ever made, but also the finest and most important movie on the subject of Spiritual Warfare ever filmed.I am, however, also, an unashamed apologist for Exorcist II : The Heretic (for which The World was not-yet ready....)apologist (n.)\n\"one who speaks or write in defense of something,\" especially \"a defender of Christianity,\" 1630s, from French apologiste, from apologie, from Late Latin apologia \"a speech in defense\"At the outset, let me say this - put on your David Lynch Glasses.A film such as this can only really be approached beginning at a firmly pre-conscious level; where it begins to fall apart however, therefore, is that while David Lynch maintains total and absolute authorial control over every aspect of the production (cinematography and sound in particular, in case that not being too obvious), and only picks out and works with actors who he knows and trusts to plumb the depths of their own psyches and the collective unconscious enough to tap into what he wants (even if he very often does not know what he actually wants, or indeed what he is doing until it is done being captured on film).What happens instead here is that there is a baggy creative looseness (no-doubt excacerbated by John Boorman's 6 week illness in the midst of principle photography), so the whole thing drifts about alarmingly and looses focus, so your inner-eye and attention is never drawn quite where it is supposed to be for much of the film and the actors don't really know exactly what they are meant to be doing, so the emotional tone is just all over the map in places.So when something in a David Lynch film comes across as absurd, tacky or bad, its because (and you can be assured of the fact that) Lynch WANTS it to be absurd, tacky or bad - it isn't because it just doesn't work.And in Exorcist II : The Heretic that isn't the case - so the viewer, even the most charitable apologist such as myself - is constantly being challenged to decide : is this consciously esoteric and dream-like (as much of the film is, or could take place viewed from the perspective of a dream), or is it just an attempt to do something over-ambitious (such as a man falling off the side of a mountain and his body becoming lodged in a tight rock crevasse) that didn't *quite* work.So your brain is constantly being overstimulated, and your mind cannot relax on being immersed within the film.There are also some horrendous errors of judgement that might have been very easily resolved and made the film less superficially ludicrous and absurd. Personally, I have no problem whatsoever with the hypnotic \"Synchroniser\" device used to achieve shared states of deep trance, it's both scientifically and spiritually not only plausible but also very largely accurate - unfortunately it just LOOKS completely silly and ridiculous, with the black and red plastic-rubber ECG headbands, and the various bleeping noises are, again, probably clinically accurate but not cinematically helpful.With every year that passes, more and more I am reminded, with regard to Exorcist II of the great, untold Sherlock Holmes case touching on the Giant Rat of Sumatra (\"For which The World is not yet ready\", notes Holmes).The central theme and message of the film - one which stands in stark contrast and defiance to that of it's predecessor, where it was the very randomness and seeming pointlessness of Reagan's ordeal which is speculated to be the whole reason a point to her being singled out for possession - that it is the purest GOOD souls on the Earth who are singled out BECAUSE the diabolical hordes want to take such powerful spiritual warriors off the board by corrupting them and bringing about their self-destruction) stands as bold a statement of Jungian psychic theory as was ever committed to film.Jung's ideas and concepts of The Shadow and Spiritus Contra Spiritum inspired the original founders of Alcholoics Annonymous, first originators of the 12 Step model for personal spiritual purgation of the demon drink, and the many other that followed, via formation of \"societies of mutual sufferers\" - \"You Must Tear Out Her Dark Heart\" Very Excellent, Sound Advice. For Which The World was Not-Yet Ready.",

            "content": "OK. before I start, I just want to say. \"Mark Kermode, You are wrong Exorcist II: The Heretic is not the worst movie of all time. Yes its bad.In fact in terms of screenplay,its pretty much appalling. The trouble is that Mr Kermode rates the Exorcist as his all time favourite movie of all time. So I can quite understand his hatred of its first official sequel. So firstly I would like to point out why people dislike Exorcist II: The Heretic so much.1)The screenplay is terrible.It really doesn't hold water. We are supposed to believe that Regan still has that demon Pazuzu trapped and suppressed inside her and the only way to uncover the truth is to use a hypnosis strobing machine so that another person can travel in to her subconscious and witness the events of father Merrins death in the first movie. Plus we find out the Regan can cure the sick ,see the future and draw scary pictures depicting forthcoming events that only father Lamont can decipher.2)The acting.. Well its pretty much hilarious. Richard Burton made this movie when he was fighting his Alcohol addiction. Half the time, he seems to be reading all his lines off cue cards. This makes his performance both mesmerising and infuriating. Linda Blair fairs little better. She really hasn't got much to do and Like Burton she is saddled with terrible dialogue that keeps her character two dimensional though the entire film. This also applies to Louise Fletcher who had just won a deserved Oscar for One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest. In this movies she is forced to say the the most inane lines, with which she speaks with total indifference. Kitty Winn, James Earl Jones and Max Von Sydow fair only slightly better with Ned DELIVERANCE Beaty having a great cameo as the Pilot. And finally3)John Boorman. A great director who seems totally out of his depth with this material.The trouble is that Boorman has always been a straight story teller but the film storyline is so all over the place that no director could rain it in. The original worked because it presented its story in the most realistic way possible. Its almost scientific in its presentation of good verses evil leaving its meaning up to its audience. Boormans film is overly complex and as a result it becomes slightly pretentious.So you may ask yourself, what is right with Exorcist II: The Heretic and why did I give it a 6 stars when most people have given it one or even none. Well. I think its is one of the most visually stunning movies ever made. I personally watch it for the visuals alone. Strangely Exorcist II: The Heretic is as film of many different palates and styles and although some say this is a weakness in my humble opinion it is one of its strengths. Also the films horror elements have a strange and eerie beauty to them. from the opening where the possessed women burns to death to the aerial demon riding the wind sequence with reminds me of those cinema virtual roller coasters. There are also tremendous visuals that utilise models, such as the climb to the cliff top Temple. Plus the African Locust attack. All these sequences have a dream like quality to them that is as good visually as anything we can do to day with computer graphics. I should also mention Ennio Morricones excellent score. Although it seems out of place in some sequences it is non the less powerful and works well with some of the visuals. To sum up.As I have said before Exorcist II: The Heretic is not a good movie. But its isn't no where near as bad as certain critics would have you believe. Over the past 10 years I have seen many movies that I would class as a lot worse than Exorcist II: The Heretic.Take the film 2012. A movie made by accountants.\" Yes Mr Kermode,I'm quoting you. Then you have THE TEN COMMANDMENTS which suffers from all almost all the problems that Exorcist II: The Heretic. It has great visuals but suffers from, Bad dialogue, hilariously miscast actors but it is based on a best selling book. I could also mention titles like Sex In The City 1 and 2. Australia. \"The movie not the place\". Glitter,Meet the Spartans, Mac and me, Troll 2 and many many more.I believe you should try watching Exorcist II: The Heretic. Or if you have already seen it and hated it. Try watching it again it may grow on you. It did on me. To me Exorcist II: The Heretic is like a Wedding video where someone has filmed you dancing like you dad or doing Karaoke. You know you shouldn't watch it, but some how you can't help yourself. Plus secretly you quite like it.",

            "content": "Well, here it is--one of the most vilified sequels in the horror genre, and not without due cause. John Boorman's follow-up to William Friedkin's thoroughly unsettling adaptation of William Peter Blatty's novel is so far-removed from the mythos of \"The Exorcist\" that one wonders if the script was originally intended as a sequel in the first place. For the most part, \"The Heretic\" is a muddled possession tale whose intentions are never made clear: Father Lamont (Richard Burton) is drafted to investigate the details of Father Merrin's (Max von Sydow) death in the first film; this leads him back to recovering Regan (chipmunk-cheeked cutie Linda Blair), techno-psychiatrist Gene Taskin (Louise Fletcher, doing a kindler, gentler Nurse Ratched), and Kokumo (James Earl Jones), the young man Merrin exorcised in Africa. Given that \"The Exorcist\" is one of the best horror films ever made, it is hard to imagine what this sequel could have done to even remotely stand in its shadow. In 1973, Friedkin complained that Blatty's original screenplay relied too much on oblique symbolism; Friedkin wisely jettisoned these elements. Here, William Goodhart's script is heavy with ill-defined symbolism (locusts, y'dig?), and Boorman's direction is both bombastic (the conclusion has airplane turbulence, a car crash, and a house torn apart by supernatural vibes (or something) and ponderous (no less than 20 minutes are spent watching a dazed Burton aimlessly wander African villages). The film is filled with nonsensical moments: why does Taskin stop to help the crash victim when she has a plane to catch? why does Sharon (Kitty Winn, returning from the original) shatter the headlamp? how does Regan help the autistic girl talk? More importantly, why am I still watching this damn thing? Well...like the silly 'reverse hypnosis' machine employed by Dr. Taskin, \"Exorcist II\" lulled me into an apathetic trance...I didn't like the film...but I didn't hate it, either...it's fascinating, but in a completely ridiculous way...and not enough for anything more than an unintentionally-whimsical rental...(are you coming down to my level?)",

            "content": "\"Exorcist II: The Heretic\" has a reputation for being one of the worst mainstream sequels to ever be produced (which is actually the reason I sought the film out), and I'm not going to be one to tell you any different: this movie is hot garbage. That being said, I enjoyed my viewing of \"Exorcist II: The Heretic\" immensely; it's terrible, but it's also hilarious. From a Cinema-elitist perspective, there is no reason at all to ever watch this movie (though I do think \"Exorcist III: Legion\" has some good moments- woot Brad Dourif!). This is a film that lacks any sort of cinematic integrity... but it is really funny. If you're looking for a completely incompetent film that has plenty of awkward cuts, weird directorial choices, and bizarre story beats, then this is certainly a film you should check out. \"Exorcist II: The Heretic\" completely earns it's reputation as one of the worst sequels ever made, but that doesn't make it aunwatchable.To quote William Friedkin (director of \"The Exorcist\"): \"I looked at half an hour of it and I thought it was as bad as seeing a traffic accident in the street. It was horrible. It's just a stupid mess made by a dumb guy- John Boorman by name, somebody who should be nameless but in this case should be named. Scurrilous. A horrible picture.\"",

            "content": "The Devil is back at 8 Prospect Street in Georgetown. At least that was the intention of the directors of the terrible - in a bad sense - Exorcist 2: The Heretic, released four years after William Friedkin's absolute classic. The original easily assumes the top of any list of the best horror films of all time, even as many question its slow narrative and forget the boldness of William Peter Blatty's novel, something never anticipated at the time of its release. Nor did they imagine that that nearly $10 million production would one day hit the 200 million mark, drawing crowds to theaters with every new release or release.This time the direction is by John Boorman, who had already declined to make the first film, for not agreeing with what he considered an abuse of minors. But the protagonist, Linda Blair (who steadfastly refused to wear the makeup of the first film), was now 18 years old, and Boorman agreed to direct this second episode of Regan McNeil. With the presence of veterans Richard Burton and Louise Fletcher, and an argument written by William Goodhart - who began by writing \"The Herectic\", based on the theories of paleontologist and archaeologist Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, who inspired the figure of Father Merrin -, for John Boorman was the opportunity to realize what he called a metaphysical thriller.There was no need to repeat the formula from the first film, putting the girl back tied to a bed, vomiting green goops and uttering obscenities. And even if they wanted to do the same thing, it wouldn't be possible. Linda Blair agreed to reprise the role as long as she didn't need to wear the heavy makeup again - in the sequel, the few possession scenes were performed by a double; Ellen Burstyn refused to take on Chris MacNeil again, even though she was nominated for an Oscar for Supporting Actress; and Max von Sydow was reluctant to reincarnate Father Merrin as the original had been such a success as it had negatively impacted his career. And both William Friedkin and William Peter Blatty had no desire to work on the film, especially since they learned what Warner Bros' intentions were. According to co-producer Richard Lederer, the kickoff of Exorcist 2 was practically a low-budget remake.In the plot, after failing to exorcism a South American girl, Father Philip Lamont (Richard Burton) is given a mission by the Cardinal (Paul Henreid) to investigate the circumstances that led to the death of Father Lankester Merrin (Max von Sydow), who, as everyone who knows the original already knows, was the victim of a new encounter with the Assyrian demon Pazuzu. Due to his writings and testimonies, Merrin is considered a heretic, as the modern Church does not want to accept the existence of an evil entity capable of possessing bodies. Lamont meets Regan MacNeil (Linda Blair), now in her late teens, trying to distract herself with tap dancing and constant psychiatric consultations by Dr. Gene Tuskin (Louise Fletcher). The medical institute develops research and treatment for disabled children or children who have suffered trauma. Although she knows that Regan has forgotten the tragic events of the past, the doctor chooses to perform a synchronous hypnosis so that she can return to the room she had as a child, with permission from her and her tutor Sharon Spencer (Kitty Winn, reprising the role), and with Lamont pressure. The experience nearly kills the doctor, with Lamont's witness, who can visualize the demon facing Regan for possession of Gene's heart.After visiting the former home of the MacNeils, the priest, during another hypnosis session, is led by the demon Pazuzu to another meeting with Merrin, who was trying to exorcise the young Kokumo in Africa. Believing that the boy has managed to face the devil, Lamont goes to Africa to retrace the paths of the deceased Father, even without the Cardinal's authorization. In the process, he will encounter hostility in some places until he meets the adult version of Kokumo (James Earl Jones), who will bring some teachings in the form of metaphors involving locusts. Regan starts to have nightmares, almost commits suicide jumping from the top of a building, and starts having some behavior changes that could suggest a possible return of the Devil. At this point, the film works with the idea that Evil has never abandoned the girl and there are two Regans: the one possessed by the devil and the one that was saved by Father Karras. Lamont believes the ultimate solution may be related to the old abode, where Regan should be able to confront the enemy, preventing her evil side from winning.Often considered one of the worst movies ever, this second chapter of \"The Exorcist\" disappoints, mainly, for not following the first film, either in tone, aesthetics, or even in the events. There being no possession here, the terror of \"The Exorcist II: The Heretic\" is only related to the imminence of a threat, without the oppression and violence felt in the preceding film, making a real and very visceral fight between good and bad. As a sequel to such an iconic and successful movie, \"The Exorcist II: The Heretic\" fails completely. So it remains for it to be a kind of behind-the-scenes look at a story, in which we learn a little about the history of Pazuzu, travel to Africa, know more about Father Merrin (Max von Sydow reluctantly returned to film some flashbacks), and we see what happened to Regan four years later.This second part totally abandons the battle between science vs. Faith to bring this more scientific concept, to bring the battle into the characters' minds. It is, however, very little, and worse when the film focuses on concepts as volatile as a brainwave synchronizer (Regan is calm, says she doesn't remember anything and just wants to go on with her life normally, but even so, Dr Tuskin decides to investigate the girl's mind with hypnosis to see if he can wake up the girl's worst nightmares), joint hypnosis, telepathy (even without the use of the synchronizer) and theories of universal goodness, the main symptom of which are the plagues of locusts. None of this was enough to impress audiences who even went to theaters but didn't like what they saw. The film reached the mark of 30 million viewers and garnered many negative reviews, some known as William Friedkin, who only watched half an hour of film and already attacked the directors: \"It's as bad as seeing a traffic accident!\". For all these reasons, added to a huge number of flashbacks, whose main effect is to cut the rhythm of the story, \"The Exorcist II: The Heretic\" has many ridiculous and boring moments, not even managing to take advantage of what would be its strongest points, the presence of Richard Burton and Louise Fletcher, and the deaf war they waged, opposing faith and science. Perhaps because of the frailty of the script, his characters always seem uncomfortable, and hardly believable.There are also major flaws in the technical issues with total loss of quality, especially the laughable makeup, sound and special effects (the flight from the perspective of a grasshopper?) and Ennio Morricone's tribal music - in the opening scene of the exorcism. In a film designed to have a low budget, Boorman failed to achieve his intentions of filming in natural settings (such as Ethiopia, and in Georgetown, site of the MacNeil's first residence), having to create all the sets in the studio or in Warner's backyards, which left the film with an extremely amateur look. Everything that worked well in the original movie was totally left out in this sequel. We still have the obvious use of a double for Regan in transposing her face to the possessed version, but Linda Blair does her part well, effortlessly and without innocence, expressing her usual grimaces. The rest of the cast is totally underutilized. The roughly eight minutes in which Richard Burton made the same face, after the hypnosis session, was the subject of countless jokes at the time. In fact, it seems that the actor was mesmerized throughout the entire film, such was the actor's apathy throughout the entire film. Max von Sydow, Linda Blair and Louise Fletcher are completely wasted on a paltry script.If The Original Exorcist easily enters any list of the best ones; the opposite can be said of this continuation. According to John Wilson's book The Official Razzie Movie Guide, the feature is in the Top 10 of the worst productions of all time alongside Ed Wood's Plan 9 from Outer Space. Exorcist 2: The Heretic is very bad, boring, laughable, poorly performed and poorly directed (in many scenes the actors are poorly framed and the director doesn't notice it at all). A movie about Evil didn't need to be so bad. It could be said that the main error was the heresy in trying to continue in such an imbecile way a masterpiece, creating immense expectations and frustrating everyone. Not even the devil deserved it.... An Exorcist movie that doesn't look like The Exorcist. It's not frightening, it's not profane and it looks more like a film school experiment. This movie has a huge production behind it, the continuation of a classic that was a huge success, which makes the experience of watching it even more frustrating. In short, there was no reason for this movie to exist.",

All they do is cut out important scenes that will leave you confused.The demon that plagued Reagen (Linda Blair) in the original Exorcist is discovered to still be haunting her. A doctor (Louise Fletcher), who acts as a mother figure to Reagen, and a priest (Richard Burton), who is also sent to discover what caused Father Merrin's (Max Von Sydow) death, are sent to help her. However, the priest discovers that the same demon that haunts Linda Blair is the same one that he exorcised from an African tribalsman (James Earl Jones). After his inquiry sends him all the way to Africa, Burton finds out from Jones that the demon travels worldwide in locusts. After arriving back in the states, Burton discovers that Fletcher's treatments have caused Reagen to be possessed again.Possibly the most under-rated sequel in history boosts a  terrific cast (that also includes Ned Beatty and Kittty Winn) and features a good leading performance from Linda Blair. The direction is top notch and the special effects, score, & cinematography are all very impressive. Also the film tries to build upon the original by giving it complex layers and by taking this franchise in a brand new direction. This first-rate thriller only suffers from one thing, the script (which I will admit is quite good) is like an H.P. Lovecraft book, it is nearly impossible to translate to the screen. Still you got to give the cast and crew a lot of credit for really being original and daring. Rated R; Violence and Profanity.",

            "content": "Almost every comment or review I ever read about \"Exorcist II\" panned it as one of the worst movies of the year it was made, and possibly one of the worst movies EVER made. I finally saw it on \"American Movie Classics\" last night, so I could judge it for myself. I have to make allowances for possible censorship and being chopped up so they could stick in commercials, but in the end I have to agree that this movie is phenomenally bad. What makes it worse is that here and there are some pretty effective individual film special effects, sound effects, bits of stage business and delivered lines that DO hit the mark, and these glints of potential hint at a really unsettling and creepy apocalyptic thriller that could have left the viewer shaken and afraid. But someone - Boorman the director, or the writer, or someone - couldn't keep control of the material, or make the script work the way it was supposed to, and the film will veer from brain-numbingly stupid to jolting and unnerving and back to stupid and overblown several times in a given scene. That's even more exhausting and irritating than if the movie just sucks. Burton is simultaneously the best and worst thing in this film. He's the best thing because he IS Richard Burton, and even his hammiest, most scene-chewing performances are worth watching in any film he happens to be in. In this case, Burton works overtime to give his character all the gravitas and portent he needs to carry the film. But he's the worst thing in the film because, well, the lines he has to deliver and the scenes he has to participate in are just plain ludicrous. It hurts me to see Burton like this...I hope he managed to pay off his condominium (or whatever financial need he had for this paycheck), because it's pretty obvious that he despises what he is doing in this film. As for the other principle, Linda Blair...well, it's almost impossible to be fair to Blair regarding this movie. She can't really act, but the camera lends a certain hypnotic quality to her face in this movie, and Boorman exploits it for all he can. I think she tried hard to give Boorman what he wanted, but unfortunately what he wanted was for her to alternate \"Rebecca Of Sunnybrook Farm\" with \"Pea Soup Vomiting Biker Slut From Hell\", and the results are basically unwatchable. I mean, we are talking Hayden-in-Attack-Of-the-Clones unwatchable. Blair was far better suited as a post-pubescent actress to the kind of \"Roller Boogie\"/\"Women in Cages\" things she did later,or as walk-on roles as herself, and I can only hope she eventually found happiness and contentment on the fringes of fame and celebrity. This is said to be one of the most expensive films ever made for its time, and in \"E2:Heretic\"'s defense, most of the money is there on the screen. The \"African\" scenes are photographed and lit perfectly, detailed, and obsessively put together... they must have been murder to stage and shoot. The apocalyptic scenes (locust attacks, etc) are not especially convincing (especially to modern eyes accustomed to millions of dollars in CGI eye-candy) but there are plenty of them and the soundtrack and sound design work strenuously to convince the viewer that Nasty Things are going on here. In fact, I'd argue that the sound design is possibly the best thing about \"Heretic\", and if it hadn't been so meticulous and suitable, the movie would have been even less watchable than it is now. \"Heretic\" is a mess, no doubt about it, in the way that only a great director working from a horrible script (and with his head jammed firmly up his own rectum ) can make it. It's worth seeing once for Burton and Blair, and a weird role by James Earl Jones. But don't go out of your way to see it and DON'T, under any circumstance pay more than $5 to purchase, and then only on DVD with all the trimmings and extras.",

This movie was really weird, including the scenes of the people in Africa with the father in the original. This movie was really pointless, and was never needed.

            "content": "Exorcist II is meaningful, archetypal, and heavy on metaphors. It's epic in scope, provocative in nature, and expansive in its subject matter. The only thing it's lacking is a plot and characters worth following.It's absolutely hilarious how hard Heretic tries to be a good movie. Watching the film is like watching a kid pulling, and pulling, and pulling with all his might. Pulling with every once of his soul. Pulling with all of his being . . . and he never realizes the sign on the door says \"Push.\" The lesson Exorcist II learned the hard way is that without an entrance \u0096 without the audience's intrigue (that precious suspension of disbelief) \u0096 the audience will not care to interpret the visual metaphors regarding the phenomena of synced consciousness, transcending the body, and limited human understanding. It's not that Exorcist II lacked meaningful substance, it's that I didn't care. And that's why Heretic fails as a film.At the forefront of the film's turnoffs is Father Lamont. The character is both written and played one dimensionally. The problem is only compounded by the fact the one dimension we get is both stale and repulsive. Father Lamont has no life. He has no personality. He has a handful of facial expressions. His calling is to single-handedly find the weapon (the healers) to stand against Satan. His faith goes beyond a \"calling\", it goes beyond a \"mission\", it's a full blown obsession that makes me want to see him locked into a psychiatric ward. He strikes me as the type of priest who would drive the atrocity known as the inquisition or the Salem Witch trials. The last thing I wanted to do was follow him and his one note \"Must stop evil\" attitude for the entire film.The original film scored points for humanizing its servants of God. We caught glimpses of the lives these holy men lead, we find out they face problems too. And some even lose their faith. Friedkin and Blatty made Father Karras and Father Dyer full blown sympathetic characters \u0096 characters I wanted to follow for the length of the film. John Boorman and William Goodhart make Father Lamont the equivalent of the holy Terminator with less interesting characteristics, less memorable lines, and a smaller emoting range than our favorite cyberdyne systems model 101. It doesn't work.On a similar note, the Exorcist was an intimate story about a handful of normal people living their lives, dealing with their troubles, and just trying to survive. The Exorcist was epic only through suggestion \u0096 through the imagery of Merrin in Iraq, climaxing as he stands across the frame from the statue of Pazuzu. Exorcist II, by contrast, lives, breathes, eats, and sleeps \"Epic.\" This isn't the battle over a few people's faith, and the soul of a little girl \u0096 we're constantly bombarded with reminders that this is the war between Good and Evil.In the spirit of the film, let me say that again \"This is the ultimate battle between Good and Eeeeevil!\" And it's not that it breaks from the stance of the original film that bothers me \u0096 it's the fact that Exorcist II can't stand on its own in its new position. The film goes so epic that it loses touch with its audience. I really don't care about Pazuzu's grand mission to destroy the new breed of healers/warriors of God in a battle between superpowers with us as their pawns. The film wants to go in that direction, and I don't want to follow it. Every creative impulse within me resists it, stating, \"This is a bad idea. Don't go there.\" Alas, the film goes there.The nail in the coffin, though, isn't where the film goes. The nail in the coffin is the method in which it uses to get there. Heretic uses deliberate visual metaphors that draw attention to themselves \u0096 like giant billboards, screaming \"Look, I'm a deep meaningful movie!\" I find it ironic how the film drains the power and meaning from its images by flaunting (dare I say prostituting) them. Granted, the film addresses some interesting topics about joint consciousness and the psychological effects of hypnosis, and it jumps to represent them with the cinematic arts using methods that strike me as both unsophisticated and primitive \u0096 like something a novice filmmaker would churn out in film school. As a result, the film sells itself cheaply, exploits itself, and whimsically throws out its deepest darkest secrets front and center of the screen, which leaves the viewer with two options: \"Believe what the film says, or believe how the film says it.\" I take option B - the film is a cheap whore.But surely \u0096 surely \u0096 one of my all time favorite composers, Ennio Morricone, would contribute a positive element to the film. The prolific and legendary composer behind the Leone Spaghetti Westerns, De Palma's The Untouchables, and Joffe's The Mission among many many others . . . I literally perked up reading his name in the credits and mouthed a quiet \"yes!\" But for the life of me, despite my deep admiration and affection for his body of work, I did not like his score for Exorcist II: Heretic.In the end, while Heretic does have a few powerful moments, they're just so vastly outnumbered by, to be quite frank, boring or silly sequences just begging for abusive commentary. Take for example the numerous times the process of hypnosis is shown \u0096 characters staring dumbly at a blinking light, speaking in the generic delayed hypnotized monotone. Who cares to see this (not only once, but several times)? When the film is over and done with, when the credits rolled after characters have lived and died and one minuscule victory is gained in the depressingly never ending epic battle of Good and Evil, I'm still asking that same question. \"Who cares?\"",

Glen or Glenda is, in its own bizarre way, a favorite. I will stoutly defend the notion that there should be an honored place for films that are SO BAD that they are good--that are, in fact, mesmerizing in their awfulness. Would we want to be without Valley of the Dolls? Or The Oscar? Or Showgirls? However--there are many types of bad films, like the A-list picture that is so tedious and pretentious that you would gnaw your arm off to escape (The Unbearable Lightness of Being, anyone?). There is the treaclefest--the entire output of Frank Capra. And, rarest of all, there is The Movie For Which There Is No Excuse whatsoever. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is exactly what we have here.Broadway playwright William Goodhart wrote what has to be one of the most convoluted and nonsensical screenplays ever. It's as if the producer went in to pitch the film as \"Four years later, the demon is still after Regan and Richard Burton is a new, tormented exorcist! Great, eh?\" and for reasons best known to God gets greenlighted. The author then promptly takes a massive hit of LSD , starts gibbering strangely, and writes the screenplay. In spite of the fact that it's incomprehensible, producer has signed Burton, Louise Fletcher (as a kinder, gentler Big Nurse), Linda Blair, Paul Henreid (a far cry from Now, Voyager), and James Earl Jones, who provides one of the film's striking moments dressed as a giant locust.The problem with all of this, of course, is that the screenplay is stuck in a kind of limbo--not bad enough to be good, and not good enough to be good--and it ends out being just boring. Even at a running time of under two hours, one longs for a pair of scissors.I really haven't got the heart to try and articulate the confused mess that passes for a plot. Rather, consider the players. Linda Blair spends a good deal of time in trances. Unfortunately, it's difficult to determine when she is in one or out of it. Kitty Winn has a thankless task as a combination of the two nannies in The Omen. Louise Fletcher glides through this mess with a surprising degree of grace.And Richard Burton. Ah, Richard--probably the saddest example of the early and rapid decline of an actor with the potential for greatness. From notable Shakespeare in the fifties to this. There is a chilling resemblance to Vivien Leigh's performance in The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone. There, she had exactly two expressions--tight and tighter. Here Burton is either tight or tighter and hysterical. In consequence, not a stick of scenery goes unchewed.The sum of all this is this is a staggeringly bad movie on every level--even some of the FX, although I did like the locust cam. And it's not fun. The only reason I give it two stars is for marginal my-God-I-don't-believe-that-I'm-seeing-this value.In the words of one friend--it's a heap of stinking poo.",

The plot, if there even one was, has to do with the demon Pazuzu up to no good again (or as Burton intones, \"eeeeeevviillllllll\"). Louise Fletcher just stands around spouting pseudo-psychological mumbo-jumbo while Linda Blair, who finally hit puberty, looks like a Kewpie Doll with a nice rack.

            "content": "Despite being considered perhaps the \"worst sequel in the history of motion pictures\" (at least until 1978) a year after its release, Warner Bros.' \"The Exorcist II: The Heretic\" was an interesting sequel in that it went many places that an ordinary sequel would not be required. William Peter Blatty, the original novelist of the first story, later wrote his own traditional sequel, \"Legion\" which I understand became \"Exorcist III.\" Here, William Goodhart wrote the treatment and is credited with the screenplay that follows the \"heredity\" (pun intended) of the character of Fr. Merrin, whom Blatty in his original novel modeled after Teilhard de Chardin, who was considered a heretic by the Vatican ultimately, and in which Goodhart focuses his story on yet another troubled priest, played by Richard Burton, assigned with validating the sanctity of Merrin's death during his last exorcism, that of the young Reagan MacNeil again played by Linda Blair to clear Merrin's life work of any stain. Some of Chardin's thought on Collective Consciousness and Good and Evil is given sci-fi treatment to visualize some of the intriguing and otherwise hard-to-fathom ideas, let alone depict visually through a strobe light/synchronizer which allows people within its frequency to interact and see and react to each other's thoughts, feelings, memories, etc. That's an awful lot to expect the average sequel to pull off, even one with a mega-history like its original and thereby causes some of the sequel's inevitable downfall. The fact that the story uses the Georgetown setting and uses some of the original characters causes the sequel to impale itself by making the real story about the demon's original identity (given in Blatty's book but not in the movie version), and making much of the only scares which are if you are afraid to look at bugs. This interesting element about swarms of locusts, sandwiching the original famed \"Iraq\" prologue with one new one of in Africa, but when Blair must connect herself with more silly acting to the actors in the Pazuzu demon story, I must sight exception of this as a very big mistake. What happens to the character of \"Sharon\" (giving Kitty Winn much more to do in this) too robs us of any plausibility. From John Boorman's direction, a director who I loved his work on the Dave Clark Five film, \"Having a Wild Weekend\" especially, and \"Deliverance\" and most of his subsequent work (I still can not say I liked \"Zardoz\"), Blair seems her AAN for \"The Exorcist\" was maybe a fluke or she just was better handled by William Friedkin who shot off guns on the set to get the actor's concentration. She is most undisciplined here, and shares time with Winn, Richard Burton, Louise Fletcher and even James Earl Jones with some pretty silly dialogue and antics given for them to perform that heighten the flaw that this is a sequel to the original, thereby crucifying the memory of it. Despite the controversy of some holdouts for acclaim for this sequel, I can not honestly on looking at it just now, say that it does work with any plausibility except to become stupefyingly vapid. Knowing the great power of the original to be scary, the idea of the sequel being so connected to Chardin thoughts on consciousness as being too serious and heady for a mainstream film, especially one is going to see because the original was considered the most frightening, and trying to scare us by our own, usually non-threatening thinking, it is no wonder that this film is usually written off. I remember liking Blatty's \"Legion\" sequel although I did not see the film of it (\"Exorcist III\"). Ennio Morricone did the soundtrack for \"Exorcist II\" and it too pales in comparison to the soundtrack of the original. I'd like to give \"Exorcist II: The Heretic\" marks for originality and inventiveness, but mashing the follow-up to the original story with anything so new and so radical is deadly to popular opinion. It fails even in its own execution of these ideas.",

The first one is a classic that pushed the boundaries of horror filmmaking and is a major influence on today's filmmakers, both because of its morbid tone, special effects and eerie soundtrack, and deserves no further comment.However, I think Jason Boorman did a beautiful film with \"The Heretic\". A beautiful and eerie soundtrack from Ennio Morricone (who never disappoints), solid performances by the main characters (specially Linda Blair and Richard Burton), and special effects which are still impressive today (specially the beautiful matte paintings by Alfred Whitlock, who never disappoints either). The story was captivating, I found interesting the mixed use of technology, modern psychiatry and religious myth in a way that has never been reproduced since, and the explanation that demons tempt exceptionally good and talented people actually makes sense.The one fatal mistake both Boorman, the producers and Warner Bros. Did in the first place (an original sin, if you may) was attach this film to the Exorcist franchise. This is a completely different film, altogether in tone, pace and theme from William Friedkin's celebrated flick (which may have a \"happy\" ending, but still leaves a bitter taste in your mouth with the sacrifice and tragedy necessary to achieve it, and still haunts the audience and leaves them in awe with the power of evil, and how much it takes to defeat it). Boorman did a \"feel-good\" film which actually resonates better as a drama or Sci-Fi flick, and doesn't even fit in well in the horror category.Early on, Boorman and the producers should have realized they had a gem which didn't fit the Exorcist lore and made the necessary changes (specially characters and the title) to make it a standalone film - I honestly believe it would have fared better with both critics and the audience this way. The director even recognized later on (which is obvious) he didn't deliver what the public expected from an Exorcist sequel. Unfortunately, we know well that's not how Hollywood works, and that executives would try to fare on the first film's success at any cost, to the point of tagging a film as a sequel even if it has nothing to do with its intended predecessor. Such narrow-minded thinking didn't even reach their main objetive, resulting in a critical and box office failure.",

I always skipped part 2 due to all the negative press, surely It couldn't be that bad-well it was-and then some. I could write an essay about its faults but ill outline some main issues.1.) Never scary. This is a horror film based upon one of the great movies of all time. At least, make me feel some tension or shock me with some gross visuals. This is horror movie, no? 2.)Acting and dialogue are laughable. I almost could'nt believe that exchange Reagon has with the autistic girl. \"I was possessed by a demon, but don't worry, he's gone now\"-AWFUL! 3.) Plot holes everywhere. Scenes are just mixed together with no real meaning (these involve a mind-reading machine,African locusts, and tap dancing??. In the end, the film never makes sense and it just serves as an insult to what was excellent about the original. The director should be exorcised!",

            "content": "The original \"The Exorcist\" was immediately iconic that still regularly tops lists of \"all-time scariest movies.\" It also made bunches of money. The seventies were not as sequel crazy as our current climate but a hit of that magnitude still demanded continuation. But how does one sequelize the scariest film of all time? The assigned director, John Boorman, had made \"Deliverance\" and \"Excaliber,\" great films in their own rights. He also made \"Zardoz\" an unintentionally hilarious piece of tripped-out seventies camp. That film informed \"Exorcist II: The Heretic\" more then Boorman's other. The film was derided when released and is still considered one of the worst sequels ever made.\"Exorcist II: The Heretic\" makes the same mistake many sequels make. It takes a very simple film and attempts to build an elaborate mythology around it. In the first film, the entity possessing Regan was referred to as just the demon or the devil. Going off one line in the original novel, the sequel identifies the demon as Pazuzu, a Babylon wind spirit. Granting the evil entity a proper name, and especially one as silly sounding as \"Pazuzu,\" tries to explain the monster, making it weaker. Similarly, Regan McNeil is revealed to have a special purpose. She can heal the sick, has psychic powers, and a great ability to fight off evil. This overlooks two key points from the original film. Regan was a normal little girl, an everyday person, which is what made her possession so awful. Secondly, the girl was merely a stopping point between the battle between the demon and Father Merrin, part of a far older duel between good and evil. Making Regan \"special\" negates both of these points. Lastly, \"The Heretic\" is knee-deep in seventies pop psychology and pseudo-science. There's the whole business with the hypnotism, long since discredited as a psychological tool. It's achieved in an especially goofy way, with a machine that flashes lights at a slower speed. The original \"Exorcist\" is still timeless. The sequel is immediately dated.Despite a story that dramatically misunderstands the point of the original, \"Exorcist II\" is not without its pros. John Boorman's strength frequently lies in his ability to create a dream-like tone of unreality. Though mostly ridiculous, \"The Heretic\" occasionally makes use of this. The flashbacks to the events of the first film make use of a clumsy Linda Blair look-alike and a voice actor that kind of sounds like Mercedes McCambridge. Similarly, the sequences showing Merrin exorcising the African boy years ago are silly as hell. However, Boorman creates some striking images. He uses sets that are intentionally artificial, with high-contrast, orange lighting. The camera sailing over the Ethiopian desert or the looming clouds of locusts are effective. Probably the best sequence is the dream-like encounter between Father Lamont and an adult Kokumo, which involves a spitted out tomato and a bed of spikes.Unfortunately, any time Boorman creates a lyrical moment, he immediately undermines it with an ill-conceived moment of unintentional camp. The sound design makes extensive use of high-pitched shrieking and repetitive chanting. There are hard cuts between Lamont's adventure in Africa and Linda Blair tap-dancing in a ridiculous outfit. When Lamont is pelted with rocks, Regan begins to spasmodically convulse. Aligning the demon Pazuzu with locusts is a strange choice, especially when it leads to stationary shots of fluttering grasshoppers. Before the character become hypnotized, their eyes roll back in their heads in a rather comical fashion. The bleating sound of the hypnotizing machine are also a really silly sound effect. \"The Heretic\" is frequently affected by a very silly streak.Further troubling the film is its two main performances. As the pre-teen, non-possessed Regan, Linda Blair created a naturalistic, workable performance. In the sequel, Blair has grown a squeaky, distracting voice. She seems like an out-of-her-element teen girl and not in a good way. Her range proves limited. Blair is unbelievable in every scene in the film. Blair was basically still a novice at the time. So what's Richard Burton's excuse? Burton is sweaty, over-the-top, and constantly starring wide-eyed. Constantly being forced to yell \"Pazuzu!\" and \"Kokumo!\" doesn't help any. He stuffs every line with as much unearned pretensions as possible. Burton's ridiculous performance puffs up the film's already overheated tone. Kitty Winn, returning as Regan's tutor Sharon, seems unsure what to do with her part. She's usually given the expositionary dialogue, which is a real bad fit. Some performances are better though. Louise Fletcher is fine. Max von Sydow retains his dignity. James Earl Jones even adds some gravitas to his brief moments of screen time.\"Exorcist II: The Heretic\" is a silly movie with an as silly conclusions. It has the good idea to return to Regan's Georgetown bedroom but, otherwise, ridiculousness has totally consumed the film by this point. Swarms of locusts explode from a door. A car slams into a wall, an unconvincing special effect. A girl burns in a fire, despite the actress seemingly not being anywhere near the fire. Linda Blair, wearing very silly contact lens, attempts to seduce Richard Burton. Regan banishes the evil spirit by dancing and spinning her arms around. Think of how stark and intense the last act of \"The Exorcist\" was. It's like the sequel goes out of its way to create the opposite of those emotions.\"Exorcist II: The Heretic\" is not the worst movie ever made or even the worst sequel, for that matter. It is, however, a deeply misconceived project made by filmmakers who truly did not understand the power of the original. The disliked sequel has found some defenders over the years, including Martin Scorsese. It's not scary, thought-provoking, or well thought out. At least John Boorman had a vision. Was that vision anybody's idea of a good sequel to \"The Exorcist?\" No but give the guy some credit.",

I then got interested in the sequel, \"The Heretic\". I wanted to see what it was all about. Everyone I knew told me it was a bad movie. The other night it was on tv. So, since I had the next day off and was bored, I said why not? The movie captured me from the first scene. With every commercial, I was eager to see what would happen next. But, then while I was watching it I started comparing it to the original, and began disliking it. I realized, that was just it. This movie is totally different. It isn't meant to be compared. From then on, I left my comparing behind, and chose to watch this film as a FILM on it's own, not a SEQUEL. I began really getting into it, and was fully satisfied with it. For anyone to understand \"The Heretic\", you must understand it is not a horror film, but more of a psychological rethinking of the original. Seeing the events of her possession, not as a horrifying thing (as portrayed in the original film) but as nothing but a trauma, then presents you with Reagan in the present, a survivor of this trauma. So, after I have explained this, I dare you to leave your Media-derived and eluted thoughts behind, and watch a different kind of movie that happens to be a sequel to \"The Exorcist\"",

But if you somehow can forget the existence of \"The Exorcist\" (1973) you may like \"The Heretic\". I know that that it is too much to ask or to pretend but it's the only way possible I can think of in order to enjoy or understand the movie. The first time I saw it I didn't understand nothing because I kept thinking about the events of the original movie. You know what I mean. How come the writers never mentioned the character of father Karras??? he was the one who actually saved Regan. And why the movie is called The Heretic?? Who commit heresy? Father Merrin?? Why?? He was given permission by the Church to conduct the exorcism. There's lots of questions unanswered. So, I figured it out that maybe if I could somehow ignored the first movie I could appreciate this one. And it kind of work for me. I thought of the movie as a supernatural drama instead of a horror one, because, to be honest, it never scared me(except for the part when they are trying out the synchronizer and the possessed Reagan appears). Another reason why I liked this movie was because Louise fletcher was here and she's one of my favorite actresses and her character as Dr Gene Tuskin was the best performance of the movie, in opposition to that of Richard Burton and Linda Blair, who were ridiculous and annoying but... hey, it's not their fault, remember? So, toned down your expectations and if you want ( or can), follow my idea. You may find this piece-of-shi_t-movie it's not so bad... ...Somehow.",

The cinematography didn't really appeal to me, except from the last scene. That scene had great practical effects if we forget the level of excitement, which was very low to me. I have to mention that I think Richard Burton (as Father Philip Lamont) did a great job! He carried most of the movie. Something that's funny is that I didn't get that Dr. Gene Tuskin wasn't Regan MacNeil's mother until almost the halfway of the movie because I think she was so much alike Ellen Burstyn.

She's seeing a therapist who believes that she might have a special gift for healing. A priest (played by Richard Burton) believes this, too, and they all figure out that the devil only seems to like to possess those who are natural healers.This is an interesting direction to take, but they don't really go anywhere with it. Director John Boorman's camera swirls, twirls, and flies with aplomb, but it seems like it's only doing that to make up for a less than satisfactory narrative.

It isn't a complete write off for me, though (nor is the director's Zardoz, for the same reason) because it has some astonishing visuals. The golden New York rooftop scenes when Regan is in a trance - filmed without a stuntperson apparently(!) are amazingly beautiful. The unsettling possession scene with the Spanish girl near the beginning is quite stunningly visualized too, I think. An amazing shot or two near the end showing a 747 threading through stormy clouds (presumably done with miniatures?) is absolutely ravishing.If a bad movie with some utterly gorgeous, imaginative scenes is your thing, then John Boorman is the director for you (See again: Zardoz).

Set four years after the original, \"Exorcist II\" features a psychologist (Louise Fletcher) probing the repressed memories of Regan (Linda Blair), who had once been possessed by a demon. Regan and the psychologist are sought out by a self-doubting priest (Richard Burton) investigating the death of exorcist Father Merrin (Max von Sydow), and it is discovered that there is still a lingering evil inside Regan.On paper, \"Exorcist II\" sounds okay. It has a cast of good actors (Sydow returns in a series of flashbacks, and James Earl Jones and Ned Beatty make brief appearances), music by Enno Morricone, and was directed by John Boorman, but all around this is a low point in the careers of everyone involved. Things quickly go off the rails. Boorman's direction mirrors less the primal terror and moral conflict of his \"Deliverance\" and more the absurd pretentiousness and unintended humour of his \"Zardoz\". There are ridiculous plot points involving a mind-reading machine called a \"synchronizer\", a trip to Africa that mostly takes place on a fake-looking studio set, James Earl Jones wearing a locust costume, and a demonic doppleganger of Regan vamping it up in a negligee. It all builds towards an ending that is confusing, noisy, and anti-climactic.This is one of those films that makes you ask, \"What the hell were they were thinking?\". The \"Exorcist\" franchise has been horribly managed by the studio (as seen with the current status of the prequel in development) and this is one of the worst sequels ever. They should just re-edit and re-title \"Exorcist III\" and pretend \"Exorcist II\" never existed.*1/2 out of ****",

Unfortunately it might make one want to occasionally snicker, and only become horrified when one asks him/herself that the 'makers of this one could have spend the production dollars on less lofty pursuits, and gotten a tidier profit in the offing ('Heretic' bombed, and bombed badly at the box-office!).'Heretic' is unjustly underrated for not living up to the horror success and excess of its predecessor.  This sequel features excellent histrionic contributions by actors Von Sydow and Jones (as the two admirable \u0091father figures'), fantasmagorical cinematography and sound (Whitlock mattes don't hurt either) and a plot/storyline that could have really gone somewhere if the makers had instead decided to write a seriously gripping novel first, and a so-so adaptation second.Von Sydow returns as a much younger Fr. Merrin.  The actor's role should have been further expanded, allowing for less unintentional audience laughs caused by other characters.  Fletcher and Burton, both talented actors in their individual right, only make matters worse by agreeing (or allowing) to break from their characters and trust the other to further ruin the storyline.  For instance, why does the, initially responsible, and highly professional, psychiatrist suddenly trust the priest to commandeer her mutually-hypnotic sessions with Regan, when the priest has not been properly briefed and trained? \nFletcher herself somewhat physically resembles actress Burstyn (who played Regan's mother in the original film), so it seems an even better (and preferable) creative effort to have merely cast her as such, instead of allowing for her character to further muddle a storyline (as evidence points in the original film, science has nothing to do with Regan's condition) that only gets more confusing as it comes to its grinding halt ending.Some video releases retain the ridiculous survival of one particular character, who gives a groaningly transparent attempt to seem victorious and biblical.  Other video versions did away with this character altogether, sparing its audience further \u0091torture' and allowing viewers to catch their breath from having laughed so hard.Why Linda Blair thought this script was worth being a part of is anybody's guess.  She was, no doubt because of her tender age, going through her own brand of inner turmoil and couldn't see straight.",

It makes the film look really bad and it makes it look like it's badly edited as well, and it is! (Kind of scares me, as this is the status of the prequel at the moment if I'm not mistaken.) The fact that it's not even remotely scary due to the cheesy demon vocal effects doesn't help... ...and I really wanted to like this film. I've been a huge fan of the original for such a long time now without having seen this first of sequels that I felt that I had to see it, if only to know if it really was that bad that everyone was saying. Is it? I don't know what to say to that. Is it a good film? No. Is it a bad film? Well...I can tell you what I liked about it:I thought the visual effect were surprisingly effective given that the film is as old as it is, and I really loved the set design of the doctor's clinic, if that was a set at all. I thought that the concept for the african scenes were interesting and I... Well, I don't know if I have anything more positive to say about it really.

Instead I got this wackadoodle fantasy story about magical children and demons trying to destroy them. Lots of spectacle and overwrought acting. It didn't work for me at all and I probably didn't pay much attention to it... I might even have fallen asleep. So, flash forward a decade or so and I see it on TCM and decide to give it a second shot, if for no other reason than to laugh at an infamous turkey of a movie. Surprisingly, I liked it. Yes, it's still the same crazy-ass movie I saw as a kid... but I've changed and am much more willing to glean the gold from the ashes. Boorman made some wonderfully kooky movies, some worked better than others but ALL of them were trying to be something more than the average. Exorcist 2 is NOT the original, in a lot of ways it stands apart and I suspect if it had been an Italian production with different stars that made no reference to the original it would be considered a minor classic. Not that it's a great movie, not at all. It's got some bad dialogue and badly delivered dialogue. The sets are a 70s sort of weird... more scifi and disco influenced I suspect. And it's not really a horror movie at all. Instead it's a mystical epic... concerned with psychic kids and evil spirits and pseudo-scientific mumbo jumbo and gadgets. I think it would make a fun double-feature with another wild 70s movie, The Visitor. Also packed with some famous actors and also kooky as can be. But my enjoyment of Exorcist 2 didn't come from how bad it was. I don't think it would work as an MST3K subject. I liked it because, despite its flaws, I could see through to the story it was telling and it's a compelling tale... full of bizarre imagery and mythic implications. I'm sure most people of the time would have preferred a by-rote rehash of the original horror film... instead they got this spiritual and futuristic epic that was free of most all the salacious and 'naughty' bits of the original. It was also pretty much free of Catholic superstition and Christian imagery. The story it's telling leaves all that behind in favor of something strikingly new. That, more than anything, is why I think it has the awful reputation it does. But seen outside the limiting context of being a sequel to a famous horror film I believe it delivers on being an interesting and compelling tale of its own. Give it a shot.",

I'm a fan of the Exorcist series, I loved I, thought III was very good and even IV has its moments. Exorcist II, however, has nothing to recommend it. This is surprising considering the cast is so good (what were Burton, von Sydow et al. thinking?) but the story is confused and completely misses the mark as either a horror or a drama story. The main storyline about the demon Pazuzu is badly developed and the inner torments of Burton's character are so ridiculous and hammy as to be deeply unmoving. The film lacked all of the suspenseful and atmospheric elements that made the others, especially the Exorcist, so entertaining. (Spoiler) The final scene is particularly amazing in that Burton, having regained his senses, does not so much exorcise the demon as beat the...out of her. Unbelievable. Supernatural horror seems to me one of the most difficult genres with respect to writing or film making in the sense that normally what fails a little, fails entirely. This fails entirely but it's not even clear that Boorman wanted to make a horror film. In a word, dreadful. 0/5.",

I particularly liked the scene where Regans psychiatrist and the priest are under hypnotherapy and the demon from Regans past is grabbing at the psychiatrists heart. I wasn't expecting horror, I knew the film was more from the \"spiritual\" angle - but it didnt even seem to get there, the whole plot just dissapeared half way through and became a messy jumble of about three different story-lines. The old priest in Africa, Regans psychic ability (which is never explained)and the main priest dithering around and upsetting everyone. I found him a particularly unnecessary and annoying character.The scene at the end where Regan and the Priest are battling the sexy evil Regan is laughable - its so cheesy, there  is no tension or suspense - (the scene I believe inspired many of the half horror half porno films of the early eighties).Also the acting of Regans maid was horrendous and thats all I want to say about her.This was a messy film - it started with the right idea, but someone got confused along the way. 2/10",

Finally, I sat down and gave it a chance.  Since I happen to like John Boorman, I really tried to be objective.  My final opinion:It's not that bad.It's not great, but it certainly doesn't belong in the same company as \"Plan 9 From Outer Space\".  The primary problem is this:  when the plot of a film revolves around hypnosis sessions, you are necessarily going to wind up with long scenes of people staring at each other and speaking in even tones. This is not thrilling viewing in the best of circumstances.On the plus side, the performances range from adequate to quite good (a film with Max Von Sydow can't be all bad), and a few of the African sequences have some mild creep value.Unfortunately, the plot takes the tactic of attempting to explain WHY the demon chose Regan, which, as any real fan of the original knows, is pointless.  In a scene excised from \"The Exorcist\", a conversation between the two priests points out that there IS no reason.  Secondly, the loud and overly bombastic ending betrays the quiet tone of the rest of the film.  It almost becomes worth it when a gorgeous teenaged Linda Blair attempts to seduce Richard Burton (in fact, we are treated to several scenes of Linda in nighties).Ultimately, it isn't as bad as you've been lead to believe, but it certainly isn't good.",

It has none of the awe-inspiring scenes from the original and instead relies on lacklustre acting and sub-standard puppets to scare. The only thing barely chilling are the flashbacks from the original considering the action scenes in this one look as though they were shot in a blender.This story is about Regan (Linda Blair) four years later who has no recollection of the demonic presence who possessed her in the first film. Since she doesn't have the bloodied make-up on when the devil starts squatting her mind, it's hard to tell whether her zombified acting is part of her performance or not. Unfortunately she uses her own coarse vocals in this one making the original demon's voice seem soothing and giving her no finesse when she babbles those colourless lines. For some reason, unexplained, she goes to Dr. Gene (Louise Fletcher), a psychiatrist even though she continually states she has no problem. So Doctor Gene uses her magical hypnosis machine. Which is a box with two light bulbs and two dogleashes attached to it. So Regan and the good doctor put on their dogleashes, round their heads, and stare at the pretty blinking lights for an hour (no time elapsed) before getting lost into a deep trance where she is lucky enough to see herself in the former movie. Regan comes out of the ordeal fine but doctor Gene who gets her heart squeezed, suffers from a cardiac arrest and sees someone violently killed emerges completely fine and still doesn't believe Regan was possessed. Just one of the abysmal scenes and an example of dismal characterisation. The whole monosyllabic script seems as though it was written by  a senile old man who continually forgets he just said the same thing 5 minutes ago. Father Lamont (Richard Burton) comes into the picture as the priest who harasses Regan insisting she's the devil. He- like any other logical person would do, goes to Africa to find the demon who thinks is within Regan, more script flaws (if there was one). Regan remains balmy, Father Lamont is stupefied after every pointless event and Dr. Gene gets more skeptical as increasingly bizarre things happen. I guess it is scarcely scary, I mean Linda Blair dances in it, the (hardly) special effects are horrifyingly bad and the ending will put you into tears upon the realisation that you actually paid to see this atrocity.P.S.

The story started promising, a priest, Richard Burton, being sent to investigate the death of Father Merrin, Max Von Sydow. Instead of following the actions of the demon and how it effected the principal characters, the movie veered off in directions that seemed strange. The entire movie was tied around a theory of a deceased Jesuit priest. Few have heard of the theory, orthogenesis, the idea that evolution occurs in a directional, goal driven way and that there is a \"global consciousness, or the priest, Fr. Pierre Teilhard de Chardin. I'm not sure if it was the unbelievable psychological therapy or the character of Kokomo or the locust, but the story just didn't deliver. And it is a pity, because there were some of the best actors in this movie. Richard Burton was wasted. James Earl Jones was likewise. Louise Fletcher helped, but she, like Burton and Jones, wasn't able to make the story riveting. What I found surprising is that Linda Blair actually delivered a worse performance in the second Exorcist. After four years, I would have hoped that she would get better, but she didn't.

Tacky, not scary, the plot is clumsy & confused with a cast phoning it. Richard Burton seemingly from a local pub. Best viewed as a curiosity, but if you're an Exorcist aficionado skip II and go straight to III. A worthy and underrated sequel.",

            "content": "I am a big fan of big-budget, well-cast horribly-written films (If there is a big-name director on board, all the better). I think of Michael Mann's \"The Keep\" with Scott Glenn, Sir Ian Mckellan (of Lord of the Rings Fame), Gabriel Byrne and Jurgen Prochnow. I think of Zardoz, with Sean Connery and Charlotte Rampling - Curiously enough, the director, John Boorman brings us to the present subject...William Friedken's The Exorcist, in my estimation, is one of the finest films ever made. Certainly it is the greatest horror film of all time. I heard that the sequel was atrocious and literally had to be in front of a television when it was on to watch it - This happened recently.I always enjoy watching fine actors grope their way through horrid films and thankless scripts and I came to pity Richard Burton by the end of the film. Furthermore, I was amazed to see an Oscar-winning actress like Louise Fletcher appear so ineffectual - 2 Oscar-winners were rendered helpless... Only Max Von Sydow had a chance and that was mainly because his scenes consisted of flashbacks with no dialogue...The film was sunk about 10 minutes in - The whole concept of the mind-synchronization machine set the destruction of the film in motion. Friedken wanted his film to appear real - an account of something that could have actually happened and he achieved this through many techniques - hand-held camera; low-key music (usually NO music)but above all, naturalistic, well-thought out and subtle dialogue. The Exorcist II's screenplay is absolutely embarrassing - I have read that a 180 minute version exists and it is mind-boggling to imagine how a film-maker of Boorman's pedigree could conceive of such a film given the material he had to work with...This film is absolutely awful but in a fascinatingly watchable way - Akin to watching a Concorde crash into a Bullet train.",

Seeing this at a drive-in, the management needed to make frequent announcements to warn viewers of noise by-laws. The movie, which cost something like eleven million dollars, a fair budget in those days (by comparison Star Wars, in release at the same time cost much less)was also given a unanimous (or close to it) critical response that was unusually savage for a big-budget studio picture. Understandaably, there are people out there who may view this as a guilty pleasure or a masochistic good time (who can forget James Earl Jones dressed as a giant locust or his classic line: Tear this ship apart until you find those plans....oops sorry that was another movie that year....\"I flew with Pazuzu on the wings of a demon\" It should also be noted that the same year Richard burton did this, he gave one of his finest screen performances ever in Equus. The response to Exorcist II may have inadvertently cost him the Oscar that year, another reason this thing deserves a higher placing. It may not be as inept as Manos or any of the various zero-budget pictures listed above, but its reputation should be preserved.",

            "content": "Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear...The central problem with this $14 million mess of a movie is that it purports to be a sequel. Given that Boorman hated The Exorcist I have no idea why he tackled the project in the first place. I think it was Kurbrick who suggested if anyone was going to make a sequel they'd have to use \"multi coloured vomit\" this time. And thereby hangs the problem, whether you love or loathe the original movie you'd have to be very brave, or very stupid, to try and re-invent the wheel.Boorman's attempt falls flat on its face. Clearly lacking love for or understanding of the material, what we get here is a mishmash of metaphysical baloney, clich\u00e9d visual metaphor, dreadful acting, laughable dialogue and a bizarre cross-cultural theme which makes no sense at all.I can well believe Burton was drunk most of the shoot; you'd need a bottle of whiskey inside of you to pluck up enough courage to say some of the lines. In fact the dialogue is so bad it is actually comic in parts. I am equally amazed that Dick Smith was behind the FX in this one after his incredible work on The Exorcist. The effects here are lame and almost non-existent, the tension absent, the shock value nil. There is absolutely no dramatic tension since the plot makes no sense at all and the final payoff is a bizarre mixture of a collapsing building, a car crash and a swarm of locusts. What can you say in its favour? Boorman's visuals are fine, Blair is angelic and suitably cute and the music is good. And that's about it.Let's not forget James Earl Jones dressed up as a locust, a groovy telepathy machine (every psychiatric ward really should have one) and a little razzmatazz by way of some impromptu tap-dancing scenes. I think I'd better lie down in a darkened room and have a rub-down with a copy of Fangoria magazine. Oh deary, deary me....",

I personally think this is due to the first film (The Exorcist) as nothing could ever match up to a piece of entertainment that good. However, I do think this film could have been improved alot and probably still can if it is restored with the latest technology.The make - up on this film is appaling compared to the orrigional. I do think they should have used exactly the same make - up as the first film. They could still improve this, as on the flash backs of the exorcisiome they could use clips and sounds from the first movie. That way it would be more scary and it would be Linda Blair and not some doubble. They should have used the same voice from the first film.Also they should have filmed the Washington scenes in washington. Not on some sound stage. I do understand they did not have permission to film on campus but they coulds restore this today with computer graphicsI personally think it needs to be digitally restored, sound and picture.\nAlso this film was made by warner brothers because they read and then refused Blattys second book Legion. If Blatty had had his way there would only be two Exorcist films that would be The Exorcist and The Exorcist II: Legion. The Heretic was relised in 1977 Blatty later went to 20th century fox and they turned his book into a film. It then became The Exorcist III: Legion and it was relised in 1990. Over all I think this film is a good attempt, acting by Linda Blair is brilliant in this film. This film should not have been made and gives The Exorcist a bad name!",

I found Burton's performance to be just shy of completely absurd, which, in turn, made the role somewhat satisfying in a very unusual way.  Blair's return to the role of Regan shows that, without the special effects and make-up, there was never much to her to begin with. It was the spectacle of \"The Exorcist\" that made Regan disturbing, exciting and spooky.  You will find none of these qualities here.I recommend this movie simply because it looks like hard work and a little elbow grease were put behind it.

But I think someone tried to make some money with the success of the original movie, but damn he failed big time.From the first scenes of this movie, I knew it gonna sucks balls. I won't tell too much cuz I don't want to explore you the plot, but most of the time the movie deals with what happened in the first movie and digging it till it find an excuse to create another problem, and a way to get something happen in the movie. However, there is nothing scary nor unique as the first movie. Not any thrilling atmosphere or unforgettable moments. The act is pretty bad and constrained, especially when there is an attempt to reach the satanic moments of the first movie.Overall, I just say this is a bad movie, even without comparing it to the first one, it's just a tedious and boring movie which makes you laugh when it's trying to thrill you. Don't expect for something which is a bit similar to the first movie. And ignore these who tells you it's a good movie, they are must be a blinded die hard fan of the first movie.

They had even delivered the outcome of the second opus of the concurrent saga: \"The Omen\", by setting fire to the bewitched children's nurse to conclude the history. But the writers were mistaken in stage or in director. Because Boorman don't give a dawn of psycho-malefic troubles of Linda Blair, it still prefers to see her in transparent nightdress than all covered with sallow vomit.

While the first EXORCIST was enormously entertaining (my New York City audience had a collective \"Prozac moment\" when Regan was told that if she took her medication then everything would be o.k., and, although I found nothing in that first movie to be truly frightening, I did commit an unexpected amount of laughter in terms of chronological pathos), I found the original EXORCIST to be shallow and -- unrealistic.  (Perhaps my relatively young age has spoilt me in terms of \"special effects\" in movies.)However, I rented the EXORCIST II last night and was most pleasantly surprised.  Although Richard Burton's character was ridiculous and the soundtrack was awkward in the extreme (due to the sappy parts of the music, not the chaotic ones), I think this movie redeemed the first one.  I am speaking of THEMATIC and to a lesser degree aesthetic redemption here.  I am sure my view will not be terribly popular with today's kind of audience, but I'm putting it out there anyway because it is pertinent.  You see, I am somebody who's experienced demonic possession herself.I was saddened to hear that the video version of EXORCIST II contained material which was edited out of the screen version.Just because a film is based on what many would characterise as \"fantastical\" themes, it doesn't mean that the movie has to be shallow and unrealistic, which is what I found the original EXORCIST to be.  Friends, WE are the dreamers and we make the dreams!  While undoubtably less resources were expended in EXORCIST II in order to achieve supernatural-like effects, I can see that a great deal more thought and work went into aesthetic coherence and research.  Notwithstanding Burton, the latter was a superior film.  You can take my word on it.",

The sets seem to be borrowed from Star Trek the TV series.

This movie was very hard to understand . It had James Earl Jones on the cast and he was only in the movie for 1 little scne and Max von Sydow also on the cast and i didnt see him once the hole movie . Kitty Winn also stars . * of of **** stars . It got * only cause on its cats .",

Richard Burton, Louise Fletcher, Linda Blair and Kitty Winn all look like they can't be bothered with the film and, if the rumours of Burton's drinking are true then I can't really blame him given the rubbish he was asked to read, Burton and Blair seem to have a strange relationship which Vladimir Nabokov would've been proud of and when James Earl Jones appears dressed as a giant locust the whole movie descends into farce.",

Anyway enough of the babbling.The films I love and that I find scary are the ones with good story lines (The Omen, The Shining, The Exorcist etc.) but I had no idea what was going on. Even at the end. I found with The Shining everything came together towards the end but this I still have no idea what I watched. I would like to be able to press 'Contains Spoiler' but I don't know what there is to spoil. Most of this film is funny as well! I have no idea why they re-shot the exorcism, and the demons voice in it is laughable. I'm surprised William Peter Blatty (Author of The Exorcist) let this film be made.Another thing, why is this film an 18?!?! It is not scary, has no gore, has no profanity at all, and has the slightest nudity (A pair of babylons for about 2 seconds). This film should be a 12 if anything.I supposed the only reason this deserves a 2 is because the music is composed by Ennio Morricone, who I love. and 'Regans Theme' is a beautiful piece of music.As I say, watch this film out of curiosity but not because you want to see an interesting film. 2/10",

The third one followed the events just after the end of The Exorcist more closely then the cheesy Exorcist II: The Heretic.

Writers today are still making this mistake (Halloween, Friday the 13th, Texas Chain Saw Massacre, Scream 3).  Okay, here's a rule of thumb:  You don't have to explain everything for it to be scary.  In fact, most times it's a let down when you do try to.And on this note, I will admit that Exorcist II (unlike most other horror sequels) did have strong points in its script, which actually tried to get somewhere . . . but mixed in with poorly conceived & cliched ideas, and the poor delivery of the film (via, acting, directing) . . . it's just too hard to see exactly what the author was trying to do.

Burton attempts to get through those pretentious pieces of dialogue even if he has to yell them, and he does!  The scenes displaying hypnosis are not only hilarious, but are embarrassing.  The original film stands alone as a masterpiece, but this useless sequel was obviously made specifically for those few moviegoers who truly enjoy pain.  An Exorcist sequel was obviously a hot property at the time, attracting prestigious actors, but to their dismay the film is horrific.  The film was pulled from theaters after it's initial release so John Boorman could recut the film. Obviously the recuts were all for not!!  The scenes taking place in Africa are well shot and slightly disturbing.  Burton being stoned by a group of angry villagers crosscut with Linda Blair tap-dancing is hysterical.

There's always another movie to fill that spot up.Exorcist II: The Heretic (1977) is a sequel to the infamous movie of the same name, released earlier in 1973. The movie follows an adult Regan MacNeil, who has lost her memories of the horrifying incident that plagued her all those years ago. Along for the ride is Father Philip Lamont, tasked by the Roman Catholic Church to investigate the death of Father Lankester Merrin, who died in the first movie (presumably of a heart attack).The movie itself does not have as much flair as the original, being a feeble attempt to piggy-back on the successes of the first movie. However, there are still some plot points that deserve recognition. The idea that the demon, identified as Pazuzu in this movie, remains yet dormant within Regan all those years, the use of the brainwave synchronizer to hypnotize Regan and Father Lamont to remember the events of the first movie and establish a mental contact with Pazuzu, Father Merrin's teachings of \"gifted\" children and Pazuzu targeting them leading the demon to Regan, to name a few.What separates this film from the previous one is that The Exorcist (1993) preys on the viewer's faith and exacerbate their fears of demonic threats to make them linger long after the movie is over. In this movie, a similar attempt has been made however, the use of the brainwave synchronizer and the persistence of Dr. Gene Tuskin as Regan's psychologist to rebutt any supernatural causes made the movie seem like the run-of-the-mill horror movie. There is nothing remarkable about the movie that would have stayed with the audience.Personally, there is potential in the storyline, albeit only a potential. Better execution would have probably taken this movie in another direction, instead of being branded \"the worst film ever made\". What really sink the boat for me was the acting. Unlike The Exorcist (1977), Linda Blair, who played Regan in the original movie and reprising her role in this one, did not bring life to the character. Similarly, Richard Burton, who played Father Lamont, was stiff as a board throughout the entire movie. He was suppose to be the spiritual support in the movie. Yes, being stiff as a board makes great support but you also need to be pliable enough to be relatable. The remaining casts acted like they were acting out of sheer necessity instead of immersing themselves in the film, though I did like Louise Fletcher's performance as Dr. Gene Tuskin.Overall, the movie is ambitious in creating this sequel, but if there is better execution and better acting performance, I would have enjoyed this movie a lot more.Enjoy the movie everyone",

            "content": "Contrary to popular opinion, I found this to be a fine film.  It's no masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination, but it's engaging and grandiose with its questions and ideas.  \n\nSome of the devices in the film are more preposterous than others, synchronized hypnotism or whatever it's called, for example, is something that has never existed and continues not to exist half a century later, and something which I am confident enough to go on the public record saying will never exist, but something that was pawned off on an audience as quasi plausible.  I'd actually be more inclined to believe in demonic possession than synchronized hypnotism, but the psychiatrist is portrayed as the sensible one and the priest who is chasing demons is the nut.  Go figure.  I'm not a fan of downgrading the demon from Satan himself to Pazuzu.  When I first saw the film as a kid, I laughed and laughed and laughed.  Pazuzu, how ridiculous, I'd thought.  Turns out he is a real demon in Mesopotamian lore.  He's still not the devil, however.  Downgrading from Satan to Pazuzu is like going from a Ferrari to a Kia.\n\nThe film falls apart to some extent in the third act.  I feel as if some key scenes were left on the cutting room floor in the interest of freeing up some time, an unfortunate reality of filmmaking in general.  If the writer hadn't at least written a couple scenes explaining the motivations behind the choices of the psychiatrist and Regan's aunt at the end of the film, he must have been a drunken mess trying to hurry the end along, because none of their behaviors which contradict their behavior in the first two thirds of the film are explained at all.\n\nThe performances were fine, particularly Burton's performance as the foolhearted priest who is ready to take up arms against the lord of darkness...or Pazuzu, whatever challenge comes his way.  Blair's acting is pretty mechanical, but she was 17 or 18 at the time, so it's excusable.  \n\nOn the positive side, which in my opinion consists of most of the aspects of this movie despite what the first two thirds of this review might suggest, the composition of most of these shots is appealing to me, some great NY locations, haunting locusts (minus the Pazuzu locust), interesting African locales. The pacing is pretty tight, not too fast, not too slow, and some of the ideas presented as it pertains to the very nature of good and evil and the associated not so subtle locust metaphors are interesting and far more clever than something I'd expect to see in such a detested film.   This movie is not the turd on a plate that I was led to believe I could expect to be served.  And honestly, that may be the second nicest thing anyone's ever said about this movie, however, the nicest thing ever said about the film was this:\n\n\"The picture asks: Does great goodness bring upon itself great evil? This goes back to the Book of Job; it's God testing the good. In this sense, Regan (Linda Blair) is a modern-day saint \u2014 like Ingrid Bergman in Europa '51, and in a way, like Charlie in Mean Streets. I like the first Exorcist, because of the Catholic guilt I have, and because it scared the hell out of me; but The Heretic surpasses it. Maybe Boorman failed to execute the material, but the movie still deserved better than it got.\"  The man who said that is some guy named Martin Scorcesse.",

Not to mention the fact that this movie has almost more dream sequences than the real ones. To make it even worse, this movie is painful to even watch! The direction isn't bad, but our characters use this machine to connect their minds together (I have no idea if this is even possible), and this machine keeps flashing lights and it made me look away from the screen because of how bright it was and annoying. Not even the acting is any good. Richard Burton as the main priest character was awful. I've not seen his other movies, but here he is hilariously bad. There isn't even an exorcism in this movie, unless you count the ending one which I wouldn't really clasify as one. The soundtrack is good, at least.

            "content": "Notorious as one of the worst sequels of all-time and by some considered one of the worst films of all-time. However, I tried to re-watch this film with a open mind, especially since it was directed by John Boorman, who is a director I highly respect and who's made some true film classics (\"Excalibur,\" \"Point Blank,\" \"Hope and Glory,\" \"Deliverance,\" \"Hell in the Pacific,\" etc.). Even when Boorman goes off-the-rails with a film (\"Zardoz\") or even bland (\"Where the Heart Is\") it's still an interesting and worthwhile film. While this Exorcist sequel does not deliver the same kind of scares and or claustrophobic oppressive sense of dread that the first film so effectively did, it does have some striking visuals (photographed by William A. Fraker) and a terrific score by Ennio Morricone. Boorman said he was attracted to the project with the idea of of making a metaphysical thriller. He did do that, but that aspect of the film, at best, fell flat with dull stretches of priest Richard Burton going into the mind of still possessed Linda Blair (now possessed by an African demon), but at worst the film becomes simply ridiculous (i.e. Burton and Blair braving swarms of locust during her exorcism, endless hypnosis scenes with flashing lights that are supposed to be scary, and not to mentions Blair's sudden lack of acting skills, though maybe it was the scripts fault). However, this film does have it's defenders, such as Pauline Kael and Martin Scorsese, who both preferred this film to the original.Overall, this film features a classy behind the scenes crew and a highly respected cast (Louise Fletcher, Paul Henreid in his final film role, James Earl Jones, Ned Beatty, and Max von Sydow as Father Merrin, though only shown in newly filmed flashbacks [oh, Dana Plato apparently had an unmilled part]), but the overall film is not very good, but I would say it is worth watching for fans of John Boorman, mostly for some interesting visuals, but not for much else outside of ironic so-bad-it's-good enjoyment.",

Even all the biblical references would work if they didn't show up so randomly. And they really messed up by having a different actress play the role of young Regan and not having Linda Blair in demon make-up. That alone could have been a selling point. They didn't even have to be gross with it. Exorcist II fails because in no way does it resemble the first film. The whole thing is a mess. But I do think it was smart to try something new.

However, unlike Excalibur where the bizarre and primativistic behavior of Merlin truly helped sell the work here it is shoehorned in and placed in center stage, no matter how little sense it makes. I mean, there was nothing wrong with the idea of tracing the roots of the demon back into Africa but once you get there there's no room for Regan's story. Instead of acknowledging that and telling a different story (perhaps focusing on Von Sydow again who looks very convincing in younger makeup) they shoehorn her in at every point and the plot quickly becomes incomprehensible. Why is Azuzu (the demon apparently) connected to locusts? How is it still tied to Regan? And what in the hell is James Earl Jones doing in here?\n\nBut just on the most basic level the movie loses all claims to credibility about twenty minutes in when Regan's psychiatrist hooks her up to a telepathy machine that lets them share each others' dreams.

The first signpost of malaise and ineptitude in the pitiful 'Exorcist II: The Heretic' is the superimposition of a possessed South American girl in flames and it is unintentionally laughable. Then the drivel shifts to Regan (Linda Blair) who has blossomed into a buxom ing\u00e9nue off- Broadway and it's queasy to view Blair in the sexy prima donna context. Denials from the Catholic Church are commonplace nowadays so the fact that the Cardinal reevaluates his position on Satan as a corporeal entity is fathomable. The sleepy tone extends to the clash between modern hypnotherapy and devout piety. The \"synchronizer\" sequence is an incomprehensible jumble of nonsensical rhetoric, hammy, trance-like reaction shots from Richard Burton and Louise Fletcher and an excruciating recreation of Merrin's battle with Pazuzu. A biblical swarm of locusts in Africa and Regan's psychic abilities suborn more narrative incongruity than unnerving terror. Retconning Regan with an ESP slant is arbitrary and monumentally doltish (ex. Her conversation with Sandra, a stuttering autistic patient, is the height of hilarity). A Jesuit priest plummeting from a Cliffside is such flagrant wirework that he seems to be sailing on a hang glider. Most of the dawdling scenes of Burton's investigation in Africa are transparently filmed against a matte painting. Perhaps though, James Earl Jones in a locust costume is the official jumping-the-shark moment. This is the worst second chapter of a horror blockbuster outside of 'Blair Witch 2: Book of Shadows'. Even on its own wobbly structure (along with an Atari-esque midi theme), 'Exorcist II' is a toothlessly unmitigated fiasco that desecrates the memory of the Academy Award-nominated original.",

The result was a laughing stock, and it nearly killed Boorman's career as well. It has Father Philip Lamont (Richard Burton), who has been assigned by a head Cardinal (Paul Henreid) to investigate the death of Father Lankester Merrin (Max Von Sydow). The Church do not believe Satan exists, but Merrin's writings claim he did, which put him at loggerheads with the Church. Lamont goes to Regan MacNeil (Linda Blair) who is training to be a stage actress, and Regan has been having counselling with Dr. Gene Tuskin (Louise Fletcher), using a technique known as synchronizer, where brainwaves and memories are melded and combined. Lamont learns that the evil within Regan isn't all gone, and it's been lying dormant. It should have been a good film, but it had a nightmarish production, with the script being re-written everyday, Boorman becoming sick for a month during shooting and some of the cast fell to mystery illnesses and some of the crew quit too.

Seriously though, if you ask me, this is pretty much \"Exorcist Episode V: The Devil Strikes Back\", and I'm not just saying that because James Earl Jones is here, I'm saying that mostly because there are too many prequels to this series, so I may as well call this the fifth installment. Shoot, the material is so dried up with this sequel that this may as well be the fifth outing for the \"Exorcist\" series, yet regardless of what you think about this film, the Devil is back with a vengeance, and quite frankly, I'm surprised it took him so long to catch up with Linda Blair. I don't know if it's so much money that's the root of all evil, as much as it's celebrity, because after \"The Exorcist\", Blair could afford some pretty good drugs, as surely as more than a few decent career moves got Richard Burton some fine alcohol. Hm, I was about to question why they got people with backgrounds that aren't all that holy to be holy people, - corrupted or not - but Burton was such a big drunk that he's perfect to play a priest, and at any rate, this film's purity is so questionable that the psych doctor in this film is, of all people, Louise Fletcher. She will soon know what Jack Nicholson is talking about when he asks someone if they've ever \"danced with the Devil in the pale moonlight\", and by soon, I mean in twelve years after this film, when Tim Burton's \"Batman\" came out. Forget the Devil, I'd be more afraid of being possessed by Jack Nicholson, or at least I am now that this film has kind of watered down the thrills behind Satan's work, and while that's not to say that this film is quite as messy as they say, it is to say that this film has its limitations, even on paper.\r\n\r\nI'm not asking that this film's story concept be quite as juicy as its predecessor's, - which, to be fair, wasn't exactly wealthy with potential - but this subject matter is even more minimalist than a predecessor that was arguably too light in scale and dynamicity for its own good, and to make matters worse, there's some questionability within this mythology, which is sometimes intelligent, but also sometimes fairly cheesy. If nothing else, the film's story concept seems cheesy, because William Goodhart's and an uncredited Rospo Pallenberg's script is so cheesy, at least at times, when dialogue hits fall-flat moments, and histrionics come into play, reflecting a certain consistency in subtlety issues. This film holds the potential of being smart, but many of the lapses in subtlety are glaring, with some being, well, kind of dumb, and no matter how much entertainment value and highlights get the final product by as decent, the writing lowlights are hard to deny, particularly when they begin to fiddle with the integrity of characterization. I suppose characterization is passable, and many of the performances are certainly endearing enough to bring the improvably drawn characters to life, but on paper, there's something lacking about developmental depth, resulting in undercooking that distances you a bit from the characters, especially considering that this film has a good bit of time that it could have dedicated to exposition, but ends up dedicating to draggy, repetitious material that meanders along, stressing natural shortcomings and being itself stressed by atmospheric pacing problems. Really, the film might not be quite as slow as its predecessor, and yet, when the meditativeness that was much more prominent in 1973's \"The Exorcist\" comes into play here, it's not quite as effective as it should be, having engaging moments, but many more moments in which material is not soaked up enough to compensate for atmospheric dry spells that dull things down and further distance you from a film whose writing, alone, places plenty of challenges before your investment. The film isn't quite as big of a mess as they say, but it's still a mess, and a big enough one to where mediocrity stands as a very real risk, backed by dynamicity, dramatic and pacing shortcomings that make the final product, at the very least, a substantially inferior sequel that held quite a bit of potential. I was joking earlier, when I boasted that material in this series has already dried up, because this is a pretty different sequel that stands to be more, but doesn't exactly fall as flat as they say, being flawed nearly to no end, but nevertheless with highlights, even stylistic ones.\r\n\r\nNow, in a lot of ways, the film falls behind the stylistic value of its predecessor, and by its own right, this film's stylistic value isn't all that special, but it's still worth mentioning, at least in a visual respect, as William A. Fraker's turns in a cinematographic performance whose tasteful emphasis on sparse lighting makes the brighter moments haunting and the darker moments chilling, especially when backed by imagery whose technical value has become quite dated, but remains adequate enough to enhance the telling of this tale, which perhaps needs as much help as it can. Again, this film's story concept is improvable, having questionable elements, or, if nothing else, too much minimalist, but quite frankly, there's still potential here, thanks in part to a mythology that may be particularly questionable in some ways, but is either intelligent at times or simply endearing within its own context. As for the basic plot itself, it's messy, even on paper, but still with some intrigue to its ambiguities and layers that may not be great, and are certainly undercut by writing issues, but can still be see through highlights in storytelling, as well as highlights in the portrayals of the characters who drive quite a few elements. Acting material is even more limited this time around, after a very dramatic predecessor, and there are a few mediocre supporting performances, but on the whole, decency is found throughout this rather charming cast, with leading man Richard Burton standing out about as much as he can with thorough charisma, as well as a few gripping layers as an open-minded man of God who begins to tap into dark religious depths on a revelatory and dangerous adventure. Burton carries the film about as much as anyone, and he's not the only endearing force in this cast, so the onscreen talent is there, even if the offscreen talent is limited, and yet, the performances found on the screen are not the only ones that get you by. There is still a good bit of credit due to director John Boorman's, whose efforts are messy, but have distinctly notable highlights, for although tension is much more limited in this film than it was in the predecessor, with effective imagery and genuine highlights in material bite, as well as some strong elements within the great Ennio Morricone's tasteful score, Boorman crafts an atmosphere with effective highlights that punctuate a consistent degree of intrigue that keep the bland spells - of which there are many - from dulling too far down. Really, what saves the film is a fair degree of entertainment value, for although the final product is a mess, it's not so faulty that I couldn't stick with it as a reasonably charming and sometimes effective thriller, regardless of its many shortcomings.\r\n\r\nIn closing, natural shortcomings, backed by a questionable mythology, go emphasized by enough cheesiness, underdevelopment and pacing unevenness to threaten the final product with mediocrity, but through a striking visual style, decent performances, - particularly that of Richard Burton - and adequately intriguing and sometimes effective direction by John Boorman behind a fairly engaging story concept, \"Exorcist II: The Heretic\" emerges as a, for me, endearing thriller, even if it does fall a considerable ways short of its predecessor.\r\n\r\n2.5/5 - Fair",

With hideous performances from Blair and Burton, a diabolical script and scenes so badly shot that I was howling with laughter at one point, Exorcist II is one of the worst films ever produced.

            "content": "Coming off of 'The Scariest Movie of All Time,' it would seem that a sequel to THE EXORCIST would be rather straightforward -- a new demon, a new child, another exorcism -- but somewhere, somehow, things went horribly, horribly wrong. Screenwriter William Goodhart and director John Boorman instead decide take us on their own confusing journey of faith, discovery, and sacrifice.\n\nRegan MacNeil has grown up to become a normal teenager, with no recollection of the terrible possession that befell her just four years earlier. Her psychologist is convinced that Regan is repressing the memories of the events, and that she could easily fall under the influence of the demon once again. Meanwhile, the Roman Catholic Church has sent a priest out to investigate the death of Father Merrin, which leads him to Regan. Using a hypnotic \"synchronizer\" that links his mind with hers, Father Lamont comes in contact with the demon Pazuzu, who takes him on a trip through time and space to meet another boy he had once possessed. Lamont seeks out Kokumo in Africa and learns that he, too, had rejected the demon, only to become the savior of his people. Now armed with the knowledge needed to save Regan's soul, Father Lamont returns to Georgetown for a final showdown with Pazuzu!\n\nEXORCIST II really is a test of faith, but one taken by the audience. Disbelief must be suspended from the highest peak in order for anyone to accept the preposterous plot, which blends pseudo-science with religious mumbo jumbo. Richard Burton, a seven-time Oscar-nominee, is made to look like a fool as the deranged Father Lamont, who quickly becomes fascinated by the demon he looks to destroy. He often rambles like a psychotic, and makes for a terrible lead when he cannot be trusted by the audience. It is impossible to take Linda Blair seriously, either, when she is forced to go cross-eyed and act brain-dead during the ridiculous \"synchronization\" experiments. Thankfully, the special effects, cinematography, and incredible locations far outweigh the strength of the script, but EXORCIST II is still widely criticized as being one of the worst sequels in the genre.\n\n-Carl Manes\nI Like Horror Movies",
