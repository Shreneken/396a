            "content": "Set in a small, rural Southern town, Billy Bob Thornton's \"Sling Blade\" is so flavorful in ambiance and tone, so rich in character and theme that it's hard to believe that its roots are not to be found in any short story or novel. For while it has all the earmarks of a great work of literature, \"Sling Blade\" is actually an original creation by Thornton, the triple threat talent who wrote, directed and stars in the work.Karl Childers is a marginally retarded man who's been living in a mental institution ever since, as a child, he accidentally stumbled across his mother and her lover in a compromising position and, in a moment of considerable confusion, hacked the two of them to death. After being officially declared by the state to be \"rehabilitated\" and \"cured,\" Karl is thrust back out into the world where he forms a bond with a fatherless boy, his hardworking, compassionate mother and a gay storeowner who has long since become a part of their extended family. Also part of that family is the widow's twisted boyfriend, Doyle Hargraves, who physically and psychologically abuses both mother and son.Thanks to Carl's \"strangeness\" and homicidal background, as well as the simmering volatility and mercurial temperament of Doyle, there is always the threat of violence hanging ominously over the work. Yet, in many ways, \"Sling Blade\" is really about the goodness of people in their willingness to overlook external differences and to find the similarities that unite us all in a common bond of humanity. For the most part, the people in this quiet little community try to reach out and befriend Karl, sensing a decency in him that helps to mitigate any possible fear they might have of him based solely on surface eccentricities. Even when he is eventually forced into violent action, he does so as an avenging angel bringing swift and righteous justice, not as a murderous demon acting out of hatred or malice.The acting in the film - beginning with Thornton himself - could not be more brilliant. With his stooped shoulders, tight-lipped smile, jutting jaw, vacant expression and guttural throat-clearing, Karl became the butt of so many jokes back when the movie first came out that it's easy to forget what a truly amazing character - and job of acting - Thornton has pulled off here. The actor we've known from so many other movies is completely invisible in this role, as he literally becomes Karl in every fiber of his being and, in so doing, forces us to see the wisdom and humanity buried deep inside the person. The performance is such a touchstone of acting for our generation that it is easy to miss all the other great acting in the film, particularly on the part of Natalie Canerday, Lucas Black, John Ritter, J.T. Walsh, Robert Duvall and, most especially, Dwight Yoakam, whose portrayal of a man teetering on the edge of a psychopathic meltdown is bone-chilling and brilliant.As a writer, Thornton has shaped his film like a modern day parable - simple, symbol-laden and allegorical. As a director, he proves himself a master of rhythm and pacing, setting the mood and allowing the scenes to play themselves out without recourse to overstatement or melodrama. In fact, this is one of those rare movies in which every moment feels just right, so confident is Thornton in his ability as a filmmaker to bring his story to life on screen. He also knows how to make the bucolic setting come across as both stark and sensuous at the same time, a place of quiet stillness that provides the perfect backdrop for the morality tale he is endeavoring to tell. Finally, Daniel Lanois has provided a haunting musical score that ever so subtly draws us into the disturbingly offbeat world of the drama.\"Sling Blade\" earned a Best Original Screenplay Oscar for Thornton, but he should also have won awards for his directing and his performance as Karl, not to mention the film itself which should have won the honor as Best Picture of 1996 - although Hollywood, in its infinite wisdom, failed even to nominate it. Ah well, even with that lapse in judgment, \"Sling Blade\" remains one of the great movie dramas of the past decade.",

            "content": "A magnificent film! Watching Billy Bob, I was reminded of Bo Radley (Robert Duvall)in To Kill a Mockingbird. The irony of seeing Duvall in Sling Blade made it that much more rewarding. Yes, it's true, the ending was inevitable, but so what? The journey to the end was what made this film the gem that it is. Dwight Yoakam made my skin crawl, and Lucas Black as little Frank brought out my motherhood instinct. Protect that boy, Karl! And he did. This had all the elements of a great film: an unselfish hero who brings about changes in the lives of others in a meaningful way. Granted, had his mental capabilities been greater he might have made another choice. Given the circumstances of the film, there was no other choice.",

            "content": "\"Sling Blade\" is an emotionally exhausting picture which establishes Billy Bob Thornton as one of our very best actors, writers, and directors.  This story of a mentally handicapped man committed to a mental hospital for a childhood double murder, and his attempt to make it in the outside world, avoids the usual stereotypes about the closed-minded townsfolk and their prejudice against someone like Karl Childers, Thornton's character. \nIndeed, upon his release Childers is given a mechanic's job and befriends a young boy, his widowed mother, and her gay best friend (played by an unrecognizable John Ritter).  Unfortunately, the mother's drunken, violent boyfriend - Dwight Yoakam in a dark, effective performance - cannot accept Karl getting in the way of his relationship, and Childers must ultimately defend his new \"family\" the only way he knows how.The tragedy of \"Sling Blade\" is that Childers is a basically gentle soul whose abusive childhood - his father (Robert Duvall in a cameo) and mother made him live in a shed behind the house - and marginal intelligence have made him unable to function without violence.  More importantly, deep down Childers knows this; he knows he cannot function as a free man, and simply cannot protect the ones he loves without violence.  The result is one of the most sympathetic characters I have ever seen in a movie.  This film is one of the great movies of the decade.  (9/10)",

            "review_title": "Probably one of Thornton's finest movies",
            "content": "I guess the main reason why I wanted to see this movie was because it was written and directed by Billy Bob Thornton, who also played a role in it. Even though the man hasn't really been able to prove a lot with his work as a director, I must say that I almost always appreciate him as an actor. He's perhaps not the most popular actor in Hollywood, but in my opinion he sure is one of the better ones.In this movie he plays the role of Karl Childers, a grown, but simple man who is released from the psychiatric hospital where he has been hospitalized since the age of twelve. He had to stay in that hospital for so long because he murdered his own mother and her lover, believing that they were doing something wrong. He returns to the town where he lived the first twelve years of his life and it doesn't take long for him to get a job as a mechanic, fixing all kinds of small motors at a local repair shop. In the same town he also meets Frank, a young and friendly boy who immediately seems to like this strange man. Soon Karl is invited by Frank's mother to stay in their garage, much against the will of her alcoholic and abusive boyfriend Doyle. While Karl's friendship with Frank gets stronger, the tension between him and Doyle keeps building up, until reaching its final climax...Now that I've finally seen this movie, I can only say that it's too bad that I didn't give it a try earlier. Especially thanks to the magnificent performance by Billy Bob Thornton, this is a movie that is more than just worth a watch. But also the other actors like Dwight Yoakam, Natalie Canerday,... did a very good job. The entire movie feels very realistic, is quite sober and never tries to be too dramatic. This is the kind of movie that could have become very preachy, but it hasn't and that's something that I really appreciate. Add to this some good directing and you know that Thornton has done a very nice job with this movie.This isn't exactly a typical Hollywood movie, not in its story and certainly not in its approach towards the subject. This could easily have become some kind of cheesy TV-movie, but Billy Bob Thornton has made a very good movie out of it instead. I really appreciated his work as a director, actor and writer in this movie, liked the story and was intrigued by the acting of all the actors. That's why I give it a 7.5/10, maybe even an 8/10.",

            "content": "I remember first watching Sling Blade and thinking, \"Oh no, here is a Forest Gump copycat.\" After all, the main character, Karl (Billy Bob Thornton) was mentally challenged and they were in the South. In reality, that's where the similarities stopped, but I didn't know that at the time. The second detractor for me was Billy Bob Thornton. I had only seen Billy Bob in one movie before Sling Blade and that was Bad Santa (yes I saw Sling Blade for the first time that many years later) and I thought that movie was dreadful, hence my impression of Billy Bob was also negative.Sling Blade was a welcome surprise. Billy Bob did an excellent job with the role and of course I was doubly surprised to see that he had written and directed the movie.Sling Blade was terrific in its simplicity. Karl was a simple man, he lived with simple folks in a simple town. That's not to say that they were without problems. Karl's mental handicap, Linda Wheatley's (Natalie Canderday) man issues, Frank Wheatley's (Lucas Black) fatherless issues, Doyle's (Dwight Yoakam) drinking problem, et al. For the simplicity of it all it was simply perfect.",

            "content": "As someone who loves good filmmaking, I rate this film among the best I've ever seen in all areas of the craft. Some of the criticisms of this film are hard to fathom.The screenplay has the tight conciseness of a well-honed play (which this essentially was derived from) and doesn't fail to prick at the emotions and the intellect of the viewer. The photography, the casting and the editing all click together quite admirably.However, I always marvel at the negative, emotionalized responses to otherwise superb films such as this by those who seem to miss the entire point of a movie like \"Sling Blade\".I did not see a political message about abortion, or a justification of murder or even a backhanded putdown of the rural people of Arkansas. (Many of the characters were locals, by the way.) Some viewers are setting themselves up to be against this film since they are wearing their own feelings on their sleeves and fail to see the subtle layers of the story. They are seeing only the reflection of themselves on the surface of the water, rather than the complex world below.Theater and film are rooted in images and characterizations designed to help us explore the human condition. It was once said that Tolstoy's voluminous novel \"War and Peace\" could be summed up in a single sentence thereby negating the need to write the book. Art is not a fast explanation, but a captivating and thought-provoking trip that hopefully forces us to think about our own motivations. Taking a one-dimensional view of this film might lead one to believe that Karl Childer's central message is that we should all eat biscuits smeared with mustard.\"Sling Blade\" excels at the job of making us examine the terrible choices life gives us by providing a set of characters who interact in a moving, curious and revealing way. It is not reality nor is it political, but a method by which we can look at our own individual realities.Others who seemed disenchanted with this film out-of-hand are those who found it \"slow\". Helloooo! This film is SUPPOSED to be slow and agonizingly so. It is carefully walking you to the conclusion, step-by-step, so you can squirm uncomfortably at the overall foreshadowing. It ain't an explosion-a-minute John Woo filmmaking and it certainly isn't light comedy, though it induces a surprising number of smiles.This is a film that makes us look at true evil in the form of J.T. Walsh, Dwight Yoakum and Robert Duval's characters and compare it to the pure goodness of the damaged creature portrayed by Billy Bob Thornton, whose own brutalization leads him to seek justice in his own imperfect way.To help those out who didn't \"get\" this film, I might recommend that you consider Thornton's character to be an amalgamation of Herman Melville's innocently homicidal protagonist in \"Billy Budd\" and Mary Shelley's sad monster Frankenstein. These characters, like Thornton's Karl Childers, were dramatic vehicles for the purpose of making us think. They did bad things but we were forced to view them compassionately because they reflected our own conflicting traits.Don't read things into a film that aren't there, but don't ignore the interesting elements that are. Get those wheels upstairs turning and start enjoying intelligent filmmaking instead of merely seeking an excitement fix!",

Figuring now that I'm a little older to give it a chance and I'm glad I did, I just watched it last night and I was extremely impressed with the fact that this was Billy Bob's first movie, not only did he act in it, but he also wrote and directed it as well. It was like Forrest Gump meets Silence of the Lambs, it was a movie that kept your nerves up and your curiosity going into what would happen next.Karl is a slow man who has just been released from the mental institution for killing his mom and her boyfriend when he was a child. When he is released into town, he has no where to stay, but then he meets a young boy who he befriends, the boy has no father and asks his mom if Karl can stay with them, she agrees to it. But their lives are far from perfect, they have an extremely abusive man in their lives, Doyle, who threatens their lives on a daily basis. Karl wants to protect them, but it may lead him back into the life that he was just told he was \"well\" from.Sling Blade is a very well acted movie that despite it's length, it keeps you going. The characters are so well thought out, it's hard to choose who was the break out actor of the film. But Billy in his first major role, he was just amazing, he looked so calm and relaxing, but yet you didn't know what he was going to do next. John Ritter was also amazing, his character was so sympathetic and beautiful. I would highly recommend this movie, it's a terrific dark drama that deserves it's praise.9/10",

Without a doubt, Sling Blade is one of the finest pieces of work ever put on film. Billy Bob's performance as Karl Childers is absolutely riveting! I found myself completely fascinated by this character. The entire ensemble of characters are superbly cast. The child actor who plays Frank is talented beyond his years. This story unfolds in many layers, with friendship and love woven between bigotry and cruelty. It begins with a somewhat horrible description of the double murder of Karl's mother and her lover, but yet is tastefully done with words, no cheap views of blood and gore. It shows how the lack of parental love and understanding can form an individual, but also how the human heart can still have the capacity to be open, as in the relationship between Karl and Frank. You'll feel completely drawn into this little family with its pain and problems.This is a masterpiece of superb acting, writing and directing! If you haven't seen it yet, please don't deny yourself the opportunity of viewing one of the most amazingly touching movies you will ever see. Even in the company of great performances by Tom Hanks and Dustin Hoffman, I think Sling Blade leaves Forrest Gump and Rain Man in the dust!",

            "content": "No film in recent years has held me as spellbound as SLING BLADE, written by BILLY BOB THORNTON (for which he won an Oscar for Best Screenplay), and starring the actor in a memorable role for which he was Oscar nominated but failed to win.He becomes the character with such truth--and such emotional underplaying--that he makes the whole story even more moving than it would have been with any other actor in the leading role. He plays a retarded man released from prison after serving twenty-five years for killing his mother and her lover with a sling blade. He felt morally justified because he saw their act of love as evil, only later realizing that it was wrong to kill them.We follow his release, first accepted with kindness by a local repair shop where he reveals himself to be skilled at fixing motors, then received into the family of a boy he's befriended, played wonderfully by LUCAS BLACK. Unfortunately, the family life is ruined by a violently dysfunctional man called Doyle (DWIGHT YOAKAM) who is a crude bully and redneck full of bitter hatred and resenting the intrusion of Thornton and the boy and possessive in his relationship with the mother.The biggest weakness in the screenplay is figuring out why the mother would ever be attracted by such a bigoted bully. Yoakam plays him in a ruthless manner that shows no compassion for the character and he's so evil that you have to wonder about the mother's mental faculties in letting him even near the family. It's also hard to believe that she would let the retired man use her garage for shelter on such short acquaintance with her son. But hey, this is a movie, this is the script, and that's it.All of the acting is uniformly excellent, particularly BILLY BOB THORNTON, who was nominated and would have deserved the Oscar for his penetrating study of a retarded man without a single false note.Tension builds because the viewer is aware that some sort of confrontation has to happen between Karl (Thornton) and Doyle. It's a matter of waiting to see what develops and that's what keeps the viewer hooked onto the story and wondering how it will conclude.It's a fully realized slice of life, Southern style with hillbilly overtones, always centered on the main thrust of the story without ever losing its touch, rich in atmospheric detail. J.T. WALSH as a fellow inmate is impressive, as is JOHN RITTER (whom I didn't even recognize at first) as a sympathetic gay man, amazingly real in a serious role. ROBERT DUVALL has a cameo bit as an indifferent father that he plays faultlessly.Summing up: Brilliant film, highly recommended and involving a very touching relationship between the small boy and the retarded man.",

I just loved it from beginning to end.First I would like to comment on the excellent acting across the board, especially the late John Ritter and Billy Bob Thornton's ensemble portrayal of Karl. I could not help but feel very attached to Karl from the opening scene, his release from the mental institution, his struggles with the outside world, and how he related to the town people. Sling Blade is one of those movies that I would love to sit down and  talk about for hours with a friend. I would also love to hear others' perspectives about what made this movie great.It seems that every scene was worked to perfection. From the lighting and camera's viewpoint to the acting and music. I enjoyed every scene, but thought that three really stood out. Without giving too much away, they are as follows. No spoilers here:1. Inside the house after band practice where Karl does not move from the couch.2. When Karl is visited at work and we see him make eye contact for the first time.3. The scene where Karl is in the garage late at night. The chilling music really captures the mood. My heart was pounding during this one!\nI hold Mr. Thornton to a very high respect.

            "review_title": "Tater thoughts---10/10.",
            "content": "First off, while trying to describe what is great about this movie, one need to look no further than the stand out performance given by Billy Bob Thornton as Karl Childers, a retarded man just released from a mental facility after having paid off his debt to society for a murder he committed as a boy. Certainly one could look beyond Thornton's performance to find many outstanding performances (there isn't a bad one in the bunch) by the supporting cast, but I think it's important to highlight Billy Bob Thornton's performance.What is usually pointed out, or at least referred to at length in describing Thornton's portrayal, centers around his extended jaw with his shovel wide grin, the slumped shoulders, and always, without fail, the gravelly \"mmm, himh\" voice. And while all of that is quite impressive, especially in that it did not require the use of masks or extended layers of make up to transform his appearance, what is impressive, and actually astonishing, is how Thornton can express outwardly through his body language and eye movements the complex inner workings that are central to the character of Karl Childers. It is in this way that Thornton's portrayal succeeds and allows us to invest our belief into his character; you can see the mind of Karl Childer at work, even if all he's thinking about is eating tater tots.Reviewers have also pointed out that there's a connection between the character of Karl Childers and that of Forrest Gump. Really? I don't see it. I think if anything, the character of Karl Childers owes more to that of Chauncey Gardiner in 'Being There' than that of Forrest Gump, a lot more. Both Gardiner and Childers have a steady calm about them that in no way resembles the jumbled nervous 'bumper sticker' speak of Forrest Gump. The delivery from Childers and Gardiner is very slow and mannered and occasionally with a keen perception. With Gardiner, it's manifested through double entendre or through a misunderstanding of intent, with Childers, especially when Childers is talking with the young boy Frank Wheatley (Lucas Black), his insights come from the heart, in a parental tone, however they seem to do the young boy as much good as they do for Childers. Just like the performance that Peter Sellers gave as Chauncey Gardiner in 'Being There', the performance from Billy Bob Thornton as Karl Childers in 'Sling Blade' would garner an Oscar nomination, but no Oscar. What should also be noted is the speed of the movie. This has everything to do with respect to the main character, Childers. If ever a movie captured the right speed in which to tell its story, it would be 'Sling Blade'. This tactic allows the viewer to think about and to feel the emotional turns of the movie as its story unfolds. We can invest ourselves emotionally into the plot of the movie, even though we can, more or less, guess accurately at its outcome.The notable supporting cast is led by the excellent performance of Dwight Yoakam as Doyle Hargraves, the violent and verbally abusive boyfriend to Linda Wheatley (Natalie Canerday). Doyle knowingly makes life a living hell for Linda and young Frank. The angst building inside of Frank comes to a climax after Doyle becomes drunk and abusive to Frank's mother. Frank rifles beer can after beer can at Doyle, and although it stops Doyle's initial attack, it only serves as a slight reprieve; the real ugliness is to follow.Along with Yoakam and Lucas, the performances from John Ritter and J.T. Walsh stand out as very memorable. This is a movie that will stay with you long after it is finished. I don't think it matters too much about how the ending takes place, or whether it is predictable or not. What resonates, or what matters, is in watching these characters develop and come to understand their situation, or their lot in life, and in most cases, learn to live with or without one another.'Sling Blade' is easily one of the best movies of 1996.10/10.

His behaviors, his antics, the way the media portrayal him...feels like he is just playing himself in the slimeball and lowlife roles that he is usually seen as in his movie. Never really understood why he gets work at all. Anyone can play a slimeball...Then I watched Sling Blade a couple of months ago...I was simply shocked. I was shocked even further when I learned that he starred, directed and even wrote the screenplay. The film was magnificent.First, the storytelling was great. It was very strait forward and it was in a chronological order. It did not jump, as time moved forward and one got a grip of Karl and other character's past from the conversations and the places that they visited. It was very easy to follow and the characters were very well developed, even those that had only a few scenes.Then, the directing was great. Even though the film was slow, not once did it ever became dull or boring for me. Even though there was nothing too exciting happening, the movie gripped me and I was following it till the end. I was feeling scared and sad during the climax where Karl killed Doyle, feeling sympathy towards Karl and the different characters as they began to reveal their stories and feeling warmhearted as the people welcomed a stranger with open arms.Next, the supporting cast was great. They all gave heartwarming and convincing efforts. Without them, this movie would not be complete.Finally, and the most important element of all, Billy Bob Thornton's portrayal was so real. His expressions, his reactions, his walk, his eye focus...everything that he did convinced me that he was actually mentally handicapped. I got completely lost within his character and it was him who kept me interested as the story unfolded. Then I heard the work and sacrifices that he made for this film (putting glass in his shoes so he can have the awkward kind of walk) made me respect him even more.This movie is great.

Aside from his amazing performance as Lorne Malvo in FX's Fargo Season One, I thought Billy Bob Thornton was nothing special, but he always turned in performances that could be considered decent. Nothing I've ever seen him do prepared me for this film.I'm going out on a limb to say this is Thornton's best movie; he adapted it from a play he wrote, he stars in it, and he directs it- it's his show, and he freaking kills it in every aspect. Even when he's just sitting around staring at the ground, awkwardly trying to avoid eye contact with other characters, Thornton is the center of this story, and this story, while perhaps a bit predictable and sometimes a little slow, is a story that deserves to be seen by many people.",

            "content": "Haunting, evocative, melancholy, this film oozes emotion and atmosphere. Set in the American South, the script tells the story of Karl Childers (Billy Bob Thornton), a middle age man of limited intelligence who gets released from a mental institution and has to fend for himself in a small town, without support from relatives or friends.As the plot evolves, Karl encounters a young boy, and the two become friends. Which leads to friendship with the boy's mom and her best friend, a gay man named Vaughan (John Ritter). But Karl must also interact with the mom's live-in boyfriend, a cruel redneck named Doyle (Dwight Yoakam). This eclectic character mix provides the fuel for the story's slowly developing climax. And throughout there's a sense of fatalistic doom.The central figure, Karl, is richly conceived, and very well played by Thornton. His humped-over posture, jutting jaw, jarring voice, physical gestures, and unchanging facial expression combine to present a highly cohesive, realistic, and memorable character. Supporting characters are almost as strong. And the actors playing these roles are well cast, and give excellent performances. There's not a weak casting or acting link in the bunch.Cinematography adds enormously to the emotion and atmosphere. Camera shots tend to be static; colors are generally muted with a trend toward brownish-yellow hues. Shadows add melancholy to interior scenes. And production design is outstanding in its detail and replication of a Southern, rural setting. The visuals remind me a lot of the film \"Silkwood\", with a similarly depressing, down-home, mournful backdrop.Technically, the film has very few weaknesses, though I do think a few scenes could be cut shorter or deleted entirely. And though I empathize with Karl, that downtrodden feel of his character and of the plot begins to grow thin after a couple of hours.This is a film that really pulls at your heartstrings. It just drips with sentiment and down-home, downtrodden atmosphere. It's sad, slow, and highly mournful, though punctuated with occasional humor. It's a film that the big Hollywood studios, with their corporate greed mentality and obnoxious hype, refuse to promote. Thank goodness for the originality and high quality of indie productions like \"Sling Blade\".",

But that is surely not all. His part as director deserves a big thumbs up as well. Many beautiful shots, an underhelmingly told (yet at the same time utterly provocative) story, a stunning soundtrack; together they form just three more indispensable elements to the whole.And then, there's J.T. Walsh. And John Ritter. Plus Dwight Yoakam. Let's not forget Robert Duvall. Or Lucas Black ^. Unfortunately, Natalie Canerday's important part as Linda Wheatley was not all that impressive, but alas.Next up: the story. Predictable? Maybe, but Doyle could have (easily) killed Karl, Frank is pretty much a 'young Karl in the making' (with results to spare), and so on. The eventual outcome is also 'one of those options', but the eventual tragedy of 'Sling blade' is a perfect choice, dramatically.'Sling blade' is a very atmospheric, laid-back, yet also utterly dark tale of a 'just' couple of summer days in some (Southern U.S.) small-town with plenty of thunderous clouds in the distance. The ending is a little predictable, \"Mmm-hmm\", perhaps... but befitting.A big 10 out of 10.^ Jim Jarmusch as Frostee Cream boy, Vic Chesnutt (R.i.p.) and Brent Briscoe (also with Thornton in 'A simple plan').",

These stories can be whimsical, mirthful or oftentimes so dramatic as to capture our very soul. Such a story is \" Sling Blade \" written, directed and staring Billy Bob Thornton. His quiet but dynamic story is about Karl Childers, a mentally retarded man who was incarcerated in the state Mental hospital for a duel murder. Years later the state has released him back into society where he meets and befriends a young boy. (Lucas Black) The boy's mother invites Karl to live with them, which doesn't bother anyone except the new boyfriend, Doyle Hargraves (Dwight Yoakam). Hargraves attempts to impose his drunken, abusive authority on the household which leads to direct confrontation with Karl. This awkward situation chafes on Hargraves who demands the boy and his mother throw the 'retard' out. At the same time Karl warns him, if he attempts to harm either one, he will prevent it. John Ritter plays Vaughan Cunningham a gay friend of the family and perhaps a most powerful if not courageous role for the lovable TV. star. J.T. Walsh is utterly convincing when he plays Charles Bushman an annoying and insufferable patient at the mental hospital. The story is serious, dramatic, suspense-fully cathartic and in every way darkly entertainingly. Billy Bob Thornton is incredibly perfect as the simple man with a straight forward role which is sure to earn it's rightful place as a Classic. ****",

            "content": "Sling Blade was a highly interesting and suprisingly entertaining movie. It was very well acted by everyone involved and was uniquely directed in a professional manner by Billy Bob Thornton. There were two things that struck me odd about this movie and both seemed somewhat comical at times. The first being the easy way all the characters seemed to accept Karl for what he was, a mentally challenged killer just released from the State Mental Hospital. The second was the obvious fact that almost every individual character in this movie on some level, displayed a dysfunctional nature to their behavior and attitude. No one seemed truly happy or even content with their lives!  \nThe first half of Sling Blade was indeed very emotional at times and uplifting in a strange sort of way. You were given the impression that Karl would somehow overcome and escape his horrible past. That he would find a way to fit into society and function with an acceptable level of awareness. Obviously that didn't happen as the second half of the film took a different direction.As much as the first half of this movie was enlightening the second half became a dark study of THE violent anger that exists in all human beings and how it can adversely effect those people at the center of it all. It attempted to show how some people can control their anger and how some people let their anger control them for whatever reason(s). This was played out two-fold by the Karl and Doyle characters.The film was a good off beat portrayal of subject matter that is not always a properly understood or accepted part of the human condition. Both physically and mentally challenged people deserve opportunities that allow them to be a part of society. Karl was of course a gross exception and should never, ever have been released from the State Mental Hospital.\nWhat clearly comes out of this movie is the existence of a mind-set that looks down upon those people less fortunate or those less gifted then others in our society. The ability to overlook others shortcomings is very difficult for many individuals. Whether those shortcomings are self-inflicted, inflicted by society or acquired at birth....all in all we aren't a very forgiving people as history has proved time and again. Sling Blade offers a small glimpse of this reality to those that are willing to pay attention.",

Tonight I got out the tape and watched it, because for some reason it has not shown up on cable recently.Billy Bob here is unrecognizable from his later star persona. He is always good, but here, he has buried himself in the role and we see only the character, and not the actor. He is almost unrecognizable, compared with his later roles. There is nothing than I can complain of as being an affectation or a mannerism, or some actor's trick or shortcut at acting. What Billy Bob does here from beginning to end is acting at its total perfection.I don't want to slight Billy Bob as a director. In this film, he obtained amazing performances from John Ritter (a fine comic actor) and Dwight Yoakam, the enigmatic country music superstar. Both of these actors set aside personal vanity and image (i.e., Dwight took off his hat), and placed themselves in the hands of a very skilled director.My only misgiving about this film, which keeps me from giving it 10/10, is that I think a better screenplay could have been devised. But I have to say, with no qualification, that what Billy Bob wrought in this film should be the goal of any aspiring film maker.Perhaps Billy Bob's best days are behind him. But he has got this film to claim as his own. And even if he had done nothing else at all, I'd still say through dropped jaw, \"Wow!\"",

            "content": "\"Sling Blade\" is one of these genuine masterpieces that immediately take you off-guard. As soon as Karl Childers, the central character played by Billy Bob Thornton, starts talking, we know we're unto something new, original and unique.We meet Karl on the day he leaves a mental hospital; he doesn't talk first, forcing himself to listen to one of the inmate's disgusting anecdotes while he stares at the widow. His turn to speak comes when he describes to a young interviewer how he killed his mother and her lover with a Kaiser blade (\"some call it a sling blade\"). He was a child then and spent a long period trying to socially readjusting himself, mostly through reading Bible, not that he understands a great deal of it, but enough to reckon that people shouldn't kill each other. He talks in the dark, uninterrupted, striking by his raspy voice, colossal jaw and strange rubbing-hands habit highlighting a social unease. His words are punctuated by a weird sound, a \"Mm-hmm\" growl. Karl easily reminds of Forrest Gump, another mentally challenged character with specific mimics and mannerisms, but he never feels like an imitation, he IS an original and quite memorable creation.And after ten minutes, positive expectations started to invade my thoughts, a movie opening with such an original character and gripping monologue could only lead to cinematic greatness and nothing in the film ever belied my expectations. Thornton didn't just tell a story, he delivered a performance of hypnotic weirdness, enjoyable on a primary level. I loved watching the film again, just to see Karl ordering French fries in a burger restaurant: \"I reckon I likes me some French fried potaters, mm-hmm\". Some people would call it a 'guilty pleasure', it is but it never distracts from the core of the film, which starts with the rediscovery of freedom by a man of limited intelligence and ends with a poignant sacrifice. In between, \"Sling Blade\" takes us in a small word of bleak simplicity, nothing much happens, people mind their own business, work to pay the bills, and even a man like Karl can find his place if he has, for instance, a certain ability to fix lawnmowers and whatnot.There's a very smoothly handled straightforwardness in Thornton's script, allowing each important character to touch us directly as if it was an old acquaintance. Karl befriends a little boy named Frank and their fondness is as mutual as immediate. It's the kind of genuine friendships that don't need long set-ups, Frank simply 'loves the way Karl talks', and which child wouldn't? He asks his mother if Karl can live in the garage, she accepts. It feels realistic precisely because Linda is the kind of woman who sees good in everyone, and proves it through her boyfriend, an abusive loser played by Dwight Yoakam, and as others mentioned, the second best performance in the film, Oscar-worthy in every level. Doyle is the kind of wannabe rock-star who never got his break and vents his angry frustration on Frank by pretending to be a fatherly figure on the authority department. Otherwise, he spends most of his time lounging on the sofa, drinking beer, bullying Frank and challenging Linda's patience... he doesn't fool anyone.And within this world, Karl acts as a quiet observant. His passiveness mirrors the attitude of the fifth important character in the film, Linda's friend Vaughan, a homosexual forced to live in the town for easily guessable reasons. As a potential victim of intolerance, Vaughan is able to read through Karl's deadpan expression the hints of some inconsolable wounds, and no matter how tough they were, they certainly built an inner goodness in his heart. But Vaughan isn't a \"guy\" guy and can't fight a man like Doyle, but Karl can help him to take care of Linda and Frank, both would be like guardian angels. John Ritter delivers a magnificent performance in all nuance and subtlety as a man with great humanistic intuition. And indeed, the storyline concurs with Vaughan and we get more insights about Karl's tormented childhood. Karl is a man of good heart who learned to find the good in anyone because he could see the evil in some, including himself.The ensemble cast is so perfect that it's a wonder that the film didn't get more recognition. Yet the pillar of \"Sling Blade\" is Billy Bob Thornton. He doesn't perform acting, he's literally inhabited by the painful soul of Karl Childers, and he's so absorbing that we're always in the same wavelength. In one of the film's most significant moments, there is a violent argument between Doyle, Linda and Frank while Karl, almost comically, sits there and doesn't move. But look closely at his eyes, his mimics, his reactions when each object thrown by Frank hits Doyle or the wall. Karl is obviously disturbed as if he was witnessing the reminiscence of painful memories. And somewhat he looks determined to accomplish an act of existential gravity, something foreshadowed by the powerful moment when he grabs Doyle's arm and warns him to never lay a finger on little Frank. This very moment starts the countdown of Karl's freedom days.Although predictable, the conclusion doesn't diminish the film's emotional impact. Karl's actions are less eloquent than the last exchanges he had with each protagonist (including Doyle). They all say \"Karl!\" and keep silent while he leaves as if they resigned to a deadly omen. The film ends as it started, as if nothing changed. Karl sits in the same place, with the same expression; but this time, he refuses to listen to the pervert inmate and tells him straight in the eyes. Although he played a one-note character, Karl did change and for best. Once in his life, he did well by preventing a little child to endure the same hellish childhood. And I can't see but satisfaction in his eyes in the final, haunting shot.",

The merit of this movie is all about the wonderful acting performances. Besides Billy-Bob of course, I especially thought the actor who played the young boy was amazing. Ritter's portrayal of a flaming gay man is charming without being over-the-top.I can see someone disliking the movie, it is kind of slow-paced, and full of simple, unglamorous southern people living their unglamorous lives.To me this movie is about how difficult it is to live in this dangerous, complicated world with an open heart. It's about the banality of evil, and the struggle to cope with a world that's full of that evil: A world where the employer abuses the worker, then the worker comes home and beats his kid, and then the kid grows up to be someone who continues the cycle. A world where those with mental disabilities have nowhere to go, and where mothers are forced to depend on abusers to provide for themselves and their kids.Karl is supposed to be \"mentally challenged\" and \"different\", but I interpret his role as representing the inner child inside of all of us. Throughout the movie he demonstrates a simple kind of wisdom, he is the voice of common-sense. I thought the movie would be about him getting into conflicts due to misunderstanding, or people rejecting him. Instead his character behaves quite rationally, and he is adept at connecting with and winning the trust of the people around him. He acts odd but he demonstrates a level of social intelligence that many \"normal\" people lack. His characteristic tone of voice seems to represent someone who speaks from their gut, but is struggling and subconsciously hesitant to express themselves because they are just so full of feeling that they just shut down somewhere along the line because they had nowhere appropriate to direct and express all that emotional energy.Watching Thornton play Karl is touching because it connects you that simple, innocent, yet dangerous part of yourself. The heart of you that just wants to live life, enjoy the simple things, the part of you that dares to long for a world where children don't suffer, where there are answers and justice.",

            "content": "Whenever there's a poll for the \"Best Movie Ever Made\", _Sling Blade_ should be a contender. It's a winner throughout its long runtime of 2.5 hours; it never bores, not even in the \"Director's Cut\" version in which previously cut 20 or so minutes are restored. It's a vehicle for the director, writer and main star of _Sling Blade_, Billy Bob Thornton -- and clearly he invested his life's most intense creative effort into this movie (expanded from an earlier short movie of 25 minutes), and all the effort paid off hugely.The acting is uniformly superb, starting with the ingenious creation of the leading character of Karl Childers; the distinctive speech, behaviour, and movement patters of this character are something that's likely to make you smile ever so often even after you get perfectly used to seeing them. It's like the boy says to Karl, \"I like the way you talk,\" and Karl replies: \"I like the way *you* talk.\" Indeed, this reverse is true as well; never has dialectal speech been captured on film more charmingly than Thornton's native Arkansas dialect in _Sling Blade_, so true to life it may sometimes be difficult, even for native English speakers, to understand what is being said, but you won't mind.Hardly anyone can pull off the trick of showing a grown man embracing a boy and saying, \"I love you,\" with the boy replying, \"I love you too,\" without this involving sexual connotations; but Thornton accomplishes the feat here; the relationship and friendship is portrayed as purely Platonic, that is non-sexual (as opposed to the original Greek concept).A huge accomplishment of _Sling Blade_ is on how many levels it is engaging: it's an engrossing, serious, and essentially brutal drama, but in many moments, it's also wonderful comedy; the dramatic and the comedic are often intertwined within the same scene.There's a delightful cameo by another genius film-maker, Jim Jarmusch, as the seller of \"French fried potatoes\", at the beginning of the movie; there's definitely a spiritual connection, if you will, between _Sling Blade_ and Jarmusch's work; _Sling Blade_ might well be a Jarmusch movie for all you know, and anyone who loves Jim Jarmusch movies will feel right at home in _Sling Blade_. (Speaking of cameos, let's also give credit to Robert Duvall for the few minutes he can be seen here!) Another astonishing achievement of _Sling Blade_ is that even though you have a pretty good idea about how the movie is going to end -- you don't really mind; it's suspenseful throughout.Watching the movie is likely to make you feel desperate, maddeningly helpless; or you might even become a misanthrope; because you realize that it is only through pure accident or lucky (?) chance that Karl was able to rescue (by questionable means) the mother & boy from the abusive live-in boyfriend (fabulously played by Dwight Yoakam: larger than life here, and more menacing than the repeat killer!). But how many abused families, wives, mothers, or children, are there around the world right now, and have been for centuries, and will be for many more centuries to come, yet with no Karl to come to *their* rescue? After you realize this, it really makes you despair of the human race. Especially after you realize that the suffering is at least partly self-inflicted: the mother brought the abuser's affections onto herself willingly, feeling unable to cope with her life situation on her own after her husband commits suicide due to lacking finances to support his family.That is another stinging aspect of _Sling Blade_: portraying the ridiculous materialistic divides between people, even those in their early teens; see the scene where the girl disdainfully speaks of the bouquet of flowers lovingly presented to her as coming \"from a dollar store\" and therefore being of inferior quality.Other cast members are great, too, particularly Lucas Black in the boy's role, and John Ritter as the overly sensitive -- or is it cowardly? -- but movingly humane dollar-store owner.Fantastic score by David Lanois, especially in the disjointed rock guitar riffs just prior to the murder scene; it's as if the music was mirroring the lead character's unclear state of mind, his decision-making process.It's fascinating that although we observe Karl Childers for 2.5 hours, he's not really a clear-cut, easily labelled person; we struggle, in classifying him, similarly to Vaughan when, in a funny episode, he believes Karl must have been thinking hard, philosophically, about something, although he was only thinking about food right then. And so, even though Karl is clearly mentally handicapped, in other ways he's a genius, representing a character surrounded by a world intrinsically foreign to him (\"it's too big,\" he says at the end); the world at large is different from Karl -- and so anyone who feels estranged in their life situation, can sympathize with Karl; their fate is like that of Karl. And doesn't this apply to all geniuses, or in a sense: to all artists? This was incisively captured by Vaughan when he remarked that \"being gay in this small town is like being handicapped\"; but the same might be said of people whose intelligence much exceeds that of their surroundings: they will feel similarly estranged.Yet the world in _Sling Blade_ isn't depicted as black-and-white; funnily enough, the only colour eschewed is red (because Thornton dislikes it); otherwise, _Sling Blade_ shows the world and human beings as they are, in their complex entirety and self-contradicting facets: both beautiful (gorgeous backdrops of rural Arkansas!) and at the same time hideous; both cruel and stupid, and simultaneously compassionate and kind (see the warden and his family, or the Bill Cox character who cannot reconcile his \"Christian conscience\" with keeping Karl locked away for the night, handing him the keys on day 2).",

Billy Bob Thortons performance is undeniably fantastic and he portrays the character truly well.

Carl's humming noises at the end of his sentences, the frog throat, and the redundant 'alright then' cracked me up at times. I also roared with glee as the little boy fired everything but the kitchen sink at the whinny drunk, Doyle Hargraves. Why did his mother need a man so badly that she would take on this loud mouth, enraged, drunken loser? And why did Doyle's buddies always return for another dose of his psychotic rages? While I'm asking questions: why are we thrown the old \"aren't homosexuals just sweet, nice folks\" chestnut once more? Really sick of that one, however Ritter did do a fine job with the character. No way would the 2 short chops with a mower blade do the damage Carl described over the phone. 5 stars.",

It's a role you normally wouldn't expect to see him in.The movie has a beautiful story that has lots of heart in it. It's told in a perfect slow way, which helps to make some of the dramatic scene's really powerful. It's a depressing movie to watch, which means that it's powerful and everything in it works good. I wish more little movies like this were made.There are many long sequences with only one camera-positions that show all of the actors their fine acting skills. Thorton impressed me and he deserved his Oscar nomination. Other fine roles are played by Dwight Yoakam, John Ritter and Natalie Canerday. Some small roles are played by J.T. Walsh and Robert Duvall. Robert Duvall has a very small role and few lines but still you can tell by looking at the scene that he is a terrific actor and makes the short scene a quite powerful one. Unfortunately Lucas Black isn't the greatest child actor I have ever seen but I think it's unfair to just judge him by this movie. This movie is an incredible hard one for a child actor to play in.The main character is really the reason why this movie works and why it's so good and powerful to watch but it's the combination of the characters and the story that makes this movie a true must see for everyone.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

Billy Bob Thornton plays a mentally challenged patient at an institute about to be released into society. He committed murder at a young age without fully comprehending reality. He finds employment at a garage where his ability to fix things becomes useful. One day he befriends a boy and learns that his mother lives with an abusive boyfriend. Predictable circumstances follow where viewers are asked the wrong questions in the conclusion. Thornton directs, wrote and delivers a flawless performance as someone whose willingness to please result in fatal consequences. Lucas Black plays the boy whom Thornton befriends. Strong supporting performances from Dwight Yoakam as the abusive boyfriend whose fate is obvious, and John Ritter who is also good as the mother's gay friend who has observed the situation and befriends Thornton whom he gives insight. Robert Duvall is featured as Thornton's father. While a very strong message exists, it doesn't redeem its flaws. Viewers will likely arrive at the ending long before it happens but its delivery is effective. Extremely low budget but observant character study. Score: 8 / 10",

We suddenly feel how desperate the situation is.This is not a happy film.  Far from it,  Karl's worldly goods appear to be half a dozen books tied together with a leather belt.  One of the books held dear to him is the Holy Bible.  He admits he does not understand all of it, but he lives by it.  He understands that some men are good and others have evil ways.He was put away in the \"Nut house\", as they say, because he murdered his own mother and her lover.  All this he confides in a young boy who becomes his firm friend.  This wonderfully warm relationship lifts the film at times out of its depressive mood.  \"I like the way you talk\", they tell each other. May be so, but unfortunately for me I did not appreciate nor could I understand the difficult dialects.  I am sorry I missed so much.  The story however remained clear.Karl tends to bottle up his emotions with a strange uncontrollable jerk of the chin (a clever piece of acting) and we sense a mounting tension that might at any time put him in a dangerous mood.  How would you feel, for example, if he burst into your bedroom at midnight with hammer in hand?The film rolls on slowly (perhaps too slowly for some) and we meet the local characters that provide him with shelter and try him out on odd jobs such as sharpening lawn mower blades.  A quite horrifying part of the film is the determined look on Karl's face as he files away on a steel blade to a razor sharp edge.  A man with a plan?Before the terrifying climax Karl gives the boy his most valued possession, his books including his Bible.  A truly heart warming moment.Billy Bob Thornton's portrayal of Karl is absolute perfection.",

            "content": "'Sling Blade' is one of those strange movies that comes along about once a decade, one that when it's over leaves you shaking your head and thinking, \"what a crazy, weird wonderful flick.\" I had never heard of it when a friend popped it into the video player one Sunday afternoon; when I asked what it was about, all he'd say was, \"just watch.\" I could see why when it was done. An explanation of the plot does absolutely no good in terms of describing what the movie is like. It's Billy Bob Thornton's creation; he wrote it, directed it, and stars in it. It's not a comedy, though I would say it has more laugh-out-loud moments than most films intended to be funny. It's not a murder mystery or crime thriller, but there are elements of both in it. And it's not a straightforward drama or tragedy and yet 'Sling Blade' packs the same kind of wallop as if it were. Karl Childers, the mentally retarded man portrayed by Thornton, has been compared to Forrest Gump and that's an easy comparison to make. They are both immensely likable and full of homespun common sense that belies their supposed lack of intelligence. But Karl carries with him some dark and terrible secrets. He is a man who committed murder and doesn't understand why circumstances forced him to do so. He accepts that he is guilty of the crimes and carries with him a naive belief and hope that if he lives the rest of his life in a good way, people won't hold that against him. He doesn't hold a grudge against the people, including his mother and father, who took advantage of his nature and in effect had him take the fall for one of them, though he certainly has every right to. Karl is eventually released from the mental hospital and ends up living with a widow, Linda (Natalie Canerday) and her young son Frank (Lucas Black). Karl and the boy strike up a rapport; Frank sees the slow but sincere Karl as a vast improvement over his mother's current boyfriend, the cruel and profane Doyle (Dwight Yoakam). Along the way he also meets Vaughan Cunningham (John Ritter), a gay friend of Linda's. The performances are uniformly fine; Lucas Black is yet another gifted child actor for whom acting seems to come as second nature. He is absolutely believable throughout, particularly in one scene when he goes off on Doyle, displaying a young boy's protectiveness of his mother, not to mention sheer fury. But the real revelation here is Dwight Yoakam, in an astonishing performance as the abusive boyfriend Doyle. Yoakam has this guy nailed to a T. Everyone has known someone like Doyle at some point in their lives. He is callous, hateful, self-pitying, and downright obnoxious. If you've ever wondered about a woman friend of yours and thought, \"why on earth does she go out with that guy?\", chances are he's a variation on Doyle. There is one scene which pretty much sums up his character; it is both tasteless and hilarious, as he 'apologizes' to Vaughan, Karl and Frank for his behavior by explaining that he doesn't like fags, retards, or kids. His ultimate comeuppance at the hands of Karl is truly justice delayed but not denied. 'Sling Blade' is the kind of movie where it's not so important what happens as the way it happens. Much of Karl's dialogue has entered the public lexicon, from \"mmm hmmm\" to his constant yearning for \"french fried puhtaters.\" But that is just the tip of iceberg; there's a lot more 'Sling Blade' has to offer.",

            "content": "There is a scene in Sling Blade which saddens me every single time; a scene involving Billy Bob Thornton's character, Karl Childers explaining the story of an abortion he had to witness as a child. The scene sums up so much of what Sling Blade is all about; specifically innocence being destroyed and the cruelty of life. Billy Bob Thornton released Sling Blade in 1996, a film which he wrote, directed and starred in, while even receiving an Oscar for \"Best Adapted Screenplay\". For an independent sleeper-hit to receive to recognition from the Academy is tremendous, yet it still deserved much more than one Oscar, since Sling Blade deserves to be named among the finest films ever made.Often cited for Billy Bob Thornton's outstanding performance as Karl Childers; a simple-minded, kind-hearted man who has been abruptly released from a mental institute after two murders he committed as a young man. On his release, Karl befriends a young boy named Frank Wheatly (played by Lucas Black) and soon becomes a father figure to the boy who is living in a dysfunctional environment. Surprisingly, even with Karl's disturbing history, he is openly welcomed to live with Frank, which once again exposes him to the harsh reality of life. Much of the film is autobiographically based, in the sense that Billy Bob Thornton bases much of the occurrences within the script on both personal experience and hometown incidents which transpired during his childhood.Sling Blade tackles its downbeat, complex themes by thoughtfully blending comedy and drama simultaneously. Structured in a way which is unlike an American film, Sling Blade does what few films can do; it turns what is on paper an uninviting character into a character you can hold a vast amount of sympathy and respect for, proving Billy Bob Thornton's spectacular talent for acting. I see Sling Blade as a meaningful journey of individual morals, emphasising the emotions which make us human and giving the viewer multifaceted topics to ponder and discuss. Not only that, but the film looks at the mind of a man who is deemed \"retarded\", yet even while being so he has far more emotion and personality than some characters who are considered mentally stable.Some accuse Sling Blade of being too predicable, a statement which I consider terribly incorrect, due to the film compelling the viewer through its characters, rather than gripping a viewer through narrative ambiguity. The technicalities of Sling Blade tackle the piece with an unprecedented vigour, combining dark, lonesome beauty and poignant images of Southern culture. In Sling Blade the use of low-key lighting and long takes help to add an extra level of emotional difficulty to the film, capturing the fractured image of life which has been bestowed to the characters of the film.The fact that everything slides together with such a graceful composure, means that each viewing of Sling Blade is like being introduced to an entirely different film experience. Over time, Sling Blade will become a film which is named alongside the classics of American cinema; a status it is more than worthy of. An archetype of unequalled power, precision and beauty; Sling Blade is a film which will linger in the depths of your mind.",

This came entirely out of the blue, and came across to me as a plot device designed to convince the audience Thorton's character was a father figure to the boy. In my opinion it was entirely unnecessary and way too \"in your face.\"The second problem (someone else pointed out here earlier) was that Yoakum's character really wasn't bad enough to deserve to be killed. Heck, he crouched down and meekly apologized after the boy started throwing stuff at him (and then left for the night). He should have been portrayed far more strongly, perhaps with some physical violence in the mix; verbal insults and belittling are not worth a death sentence. IMO this is a serious flaw that really hurts the script.If it weren't for these two issues, I would have given a 10/10 to this film.I did enjoy it a great deal; it's one of the few films set in the south that came across to me as realistic, and there's a certain mythic atmosphere to the film. 8/10.",

Now a grown man, he is released from the hospital and set free as he is analyzed as being \"well\". He returns to his hometown where he meets a boy called Frank who has lost his father years ago and soon a strong friendship is formed between him and Karl. Although Karl's being mentally handicapped he manages to get himself a job with some help and things lead to another.First of all, let me tell you that the story is absolutely beautiful. It tells about friendship in a way that I've almost never seen before, telling it in a very emotional and a beautiful way. It's very well written and like said above Thornton really has talent even when it comes to writing. The story is unique in a way and it keeps you interested throughout, the whole progress from Karl's release to a very powerful and sort of an odd friendship between him and Frank is simply breathing itself through the screen. Magnificent. What comes to directing, well Thornton continues to amaze me in that category as well. Thornton has translated his brilliant screenplay to a movie in a very complimenting way, making it so precise and dramatic. The movie sadly stumbles a bit when we get closer to the end, which in my case slightly lowers the final overall rating of the movie, but it still definitely manages to be a very entertaining movie throughout without any bigger weaknesses or faults.Billy Bob Thornton makes his best role performance yet to date and does it by far. I've never really enjoyed Thronton as much as in this movie, as he has usually played these amusing hillbilly roles anyway. This is a very serious role and a hard one too. The character is very well written and performed even better; All the facial expressions and the whole body language, the way the character moves, talks and thinks, Thornton does an absolutely outstanding role performance. He makes the character really alive, making it to have some real depth and a true soul. There has always been so few child actors worth mentioning, but I was stunned by Lucas Black's performance he does in the role of the young boy Frank. It's not often when you see a 14 year old boy perform a role so believably by not making it unnatural, corny or not giving this feeling of a forced performance. This is what you get when you pick the right kid for a role, a job well done indeed. Another actor worth mentioning is Dwight Yoakam, who is indeed the right choice for the role of Doyle Hargraves. Doyle is the boyfriend of Frank's mother and a very mean one too, being the only real problem and the really miserable thing in Frank's life. Yoakam performs a role of a really evil person in a very realistic way, making him the perfect villain. Though the character itself is pretty stereotypical image of a man who could beat his wife and children, being drunk all the time, it still didn't bother me at all as the movie is all about reality and simple things anyway. Somehow it still manages to be unique.I was also very impressed of the soundtrack in its wholeness, that ambient music to form an image of sadness and sorrow always makes me impressed and more emotional. It isn't used too much, there's just the right amount of it by not taking the whole story over the top. The soundtrack also includes this happy country music to describe the more joyful situations, giving you a guaranteed smile on your face. The man responsible for the original music is Daniel Lanois, who I haven't really heard of before, but I still have to give my thumbs up for the man, though I think he has only written a couple of the songs in the movie. But he seems to be responsible, so I give my thanks to him instead of every individual musician taken part. Simple as that.\"Sling Blade\" is definitely a movie worth watching. If you haven't enjoyed Billy Bob Thornton before, this movie will most certainly make you. Talented Thornton has written a beautiful story about a strong relationship, a life at its simplest, he has directed a great movie making him certainly a director worth giving that famous raise of your hat and he does a role performance no other he's done before. This movie is a perfect example of what a talented actor can do besides the usual acting. As far as I can see it \"Sling Blade\" never had the attention it needed, it seems like it's sadly left out and forgotten. I had never even heard of this movie before I noticed it having a high rating at IMDb. Well maybe it's just me who's missed it, but I'm really counting on my first opinion that it hasn't had the needed attention. Anyway, this is a definite recommendation for everyone, especially for those who particularly enjoy drama, and this is a fine drama indeed.",

            "content": "**Warning! Mild Plot Spoilers Ahead!!\"Sling Blade\" received oodles of accolades upon its release in 1996.  While I understand why so many critics raved about this film and agree with them in many aspects, I don't think it ranks among the best of the decade as many would have you believe.Billy Bob Thornton directs and stars as Karl Childers,  a mentally challenged man whose IQ falls on the low side between normal and retarded. Since committing a gruesome crime at the age of nine, he had been held in a state mental hospital   He has just been released though, having been deemed safe and stable.  As he attempts to rejoin the real world, the tension in the movie arises from the declaration of normality, which everyone questions due to the discomforting assortment of grunts and noises that the gravelly-voiced Childers emits.  At the brilliant core of of \"Sling Blade\" is the acting.  But not even its quality (which is good) as much as its quantity.  Most movies feature countless cuts, largely of the back-and-forth nature during dialogue scenes. With numerous single-shot takes, this film provides the rare opportunity to watch actors work.  It feels like watching a play from the front row, as the camera acts as your eyes, delightfully swooping, zooming, and sliding through the scenes.  Through small facial movements and expressions, one can see direct reactions being formed and decisions being made by characters, rather than just the choices themselves.  The wise decision to use such a style is more than just artistic; it is necessary to get viewers to relate with the odd characters, a task that would otherwise be near impossible.  Although many, like myself, will still find it difficult to get involved, Thornton allows the audience to connect with his character more deeply than they would in a typical film by displaying the thought processes that Childers genuinely needs to determine his choices.   In such a character study, the quality of the ensemble acting is crucial, and the remainder of the cast fills the supporting roles quite well. Everyone is very believable, despite a few recognizable faces (John Ritter, among others) playing characters in which one would never picture them. Even though many of these parts begin as stereotypes, over the course of the film most all of them are developed into well-rounded characters, which in turn fill out the corners of the cinematic world.The stage-like nature of \"Sling Blade\" carries over to its story as well. You don't know exactly what is going to happen next, but as the film continues to build toward the closing scenes, one gradually acquires a premonition as to what may occur.  This is possible because the linear plot moves uphill almost throughout.  With a few exceptions that make the movie about twenty minutes too long, each scene flows naturally into the next, adding depth to the story with each development that leads to the inevitable conclusion.    Unfortunately the DVD, which could be filled with so much fascinating information about an intriguing film, is bare bones at best.  The widescreen transfer does effectively capture the solid cinematography, and the lack of a 5.1 soundtrack doesn't detract from the simple score, but there are no special features.  You may therefore want to simply rent \"Sling Blade,\" rather than invest $15 in purchasing it.Bottom Line: The stellar acting and directing makes the unusual story work well despite featuring hard-to-relate-to characters and a too long running time. Three of four stars, rounded down to 7 of 10.",

During his short but extremely public marriage to Angelia Jolie, they seemed to take pleasure in reveling in the weirdness of their marriage in a way that seemed reminiscent of the life of Michael Jackson--with his suspended animation machine, a best friend who is a chimp, etc. However, despite my personal distaste for the man, I've gotta admit, reluctantly, that he's got some amazing talent. I loved him in THE MAN WHO NEVER WAS as well as his comic performance in INTOLERABLE CRUELTY but his most amazing triumph is this film, SLING BLADE. Unlike the other films, Billy Bob was not just a performer but he wrote the original short film (SOME FOLKS CALL IT A SLINGBLADE), the screenplay and even directed the film--and it was terrific, so I have to give this very strange guy his due. He is very, very talented.....and weird.The movie is a film version of his play. It's about a mentally retarded man who kills his mother and her lover and spends most of his adult life in an institution as a result. However, he really wasn't completely aware of what he'd done--and much of this tragedy was due to his own mental disability. Now, as the film begins, after decades he's finally being released to the community--a community he's ill-equipped to handle--or so it seems.Despite his very colorful past, he manages to do okay for himself and builds a friendship with a troubled boy. The boy, unfortunately, lives in a very violent home where Mom's boyfriend (played by Dwight Yoakam) abuses the boy and his mother. Although Billy Bob is \"slow\", he manages to see the situation very clearly and ultimately handles this situation in a very unconventional way.The film gets very, very high marks for acting, pacing and having the ability to engage the viewer.

            "content": "Near excellent experience has Billy Bob Thornton (Oscar-nominated in acting and Oscar-winning for his screenplay adaptation) being let out of a mental institution in the deep South. Thornton is on the verge of retardation, having an IQ that similar is to that of Forrest Gump. However his past is much darker. He has been locked up for a double-murder of his mother and a teenage bully who was being intimate with her. Kind institution supervisor James Hampton reluctantly lets two girls from a local college interview Thornton and his painful past is shown clearly to the audience. Soon Thornton is out again and back to the town of his youth. Most in the town have little or no recollection of the events from many years ago and he roams around with no hassles. He meets a young boy (Lucas Black) and a friendship immediately blossoms. Not everything is peaches and cream for Black as his mother (Natalie Canerdy) lives with a verbally abusive husband (Dwight Yoakam in a memorable scene-stealing part) who is quietly deviant towards stepson Black. Canerdy is also friends with gay grocery store manager John Ritter (in his finest role) and soon he confides in Thornton about his concerns for Black and Canerdy. Of course Thornton does not really understand what is going on, but soon it becomes blatantly apparent that he could be driven to violence once again. Thornton's past becomes more unbearable as the film progresses as we get to meet his alcoholic father (a cameo for Robert Duvall) and the audience realizes that something explosive is going to happen before the movie completes its run. \"Sling Blade\" seemed to be caught in limbo in 1996 until Oprah Winfrey told the country that it was the best film of the year. I cannot quite agree with that assumption, but that is not saying that it was not one of the finer productions from that campaign. Thornton was the catalyst all the way. His ability to transfer his screenplay to the silver screen with solid direction and an unforgettable performance helped him to catch his big break and he has not looked back since. A stunning movie that stands tall with other productions of the 1990s. 4.5 out of 5 stars.",

            "content": "Billy Bob Thornton's Sling Blade, adapted from George Hickenlooper's short film Some Folks Call it a Sling Blade (which also starred Thornton), earned a \"Best Adapted Screenplay\" Oscar win, as well as a \"Best Actor\" nomination for Thornton, who pulls triple duty in writing, directing and starring in this bitingly effective document of a fish truly, tragically out of water.Thornton plays Karl, a mentally handicapped man who has spent the last twenty five years of his life in a mental hospital for killing his mother and her lover when he was a child. We meet up with him as he is released from the facility, returning home, where he attempts to, with nowhere to live, no familial contacts, and little cash, reintegrate himself into society. Thus, these initial moments of Karl's freedom in of themselves are a depressing, saddening social commentary on how we treat those we release from incarceration.Nevertheless, the tone of the picture frequently meanders into acceptably sweet territory \u0096 Karl finds work with people who take care of him and understand his needs, and more importantly, is befriended by a fatherless child and his mother, who invite him to live with them. It must be said that the manner in which Karl is invited to live with this duo is a tad too neat and dry-cut, but the mother character does at least come across as generally very charitable, understanding, and pleasant.Karl's interactions with the boy, Frank (played by Lucas Black, who is quite the impressive actor himself), allow for a refreshingly honest discourse, not only between Karl and the boy, but as a viewer observing the film, it is verbal catharsis on screen. The two individuals, in their naivety, hold little back from one another, each revealing a number of home truths to the other, and it is nothing less than thrilling to watch.Much of Sling Blade's success can be drawn from its memorable performances from a myriad of understated, under-appreciated talents, from the late actors John Ritter (as a homosexual friend of the boy and his mother) and J.T. Walsh (one of Karl's comically disturbing co-detainees), to the stunning Dwight Yoakam as the abusive boyfriend of Frank's mother. In respect to Ritter, his turn is all the more welcome as it is largely a non-comedic role, although his scene with Karl in a diner is inherently funny thanks to their conflicting, entirely opposed trains of thought.Whilst Thornton quite rightly received much critical acclaim for his portrayal of Karl, perhaps the dark horse of Sling Blade is Dwight Yoakam's turn as Doyle, the bigoted Southerner who lives with Frank and his mother. In one instance, where he causes a party to turn foul, I felt genuinely angry at his character \u0096 Yoakam manages to play a thoroughly dislikeable individual with such vigour that one may almost turn to despise Yoakam himself. As Frank, in responding to Doyle's angry tirade, begins throwing items at Doyle in rage, I was in awe of the array of astounding acting talent on screen before me in Sling Blade, and by all probability, you will be also. The gravity of the hopelessness of these individuals is amplified by Thornton's frequent use of single take scenes throughout the film, almost lending a play-like format to the project.Sling Blade is a film of little ambiguity \u0096 Thornton draws dark, thick lines around his characters, and it is clear that, as the film progresses, Karl is more and more becoming a substitute for Frank's deceased father, although one could guess this simply from reading a synopsis of the film. It is not so much that Thornton is matter-of-fact about such plot arcs, but that he is not concerned with surprising his audience, and rightly so \u0096 Sling Blade is a simple story of a simple man. If one can draw any deeper symbolism or subtext from the film, perhaps it is that in the south of America, even Karl, in his dim-wittedness, can form tolerant, educated assertions (about homosexuals, for example), yet the \"rednecks\" such as Doyle cannot.Sling Blade does ultimately take the expected turn, one which can be guessed a good ninety minutes prior to its actual occurrence. However, this is not important \u0096 what is important, and more to the point, what is interesting about what occurs in the final ten minutes of the film, is the morality of the situation. It may divide audiences in some respects, yet what is clear is that what it says about society and human beings in general is very disturbing. The film's close, whilst mired in tragedy, is uplifting in its own stomach churning way, and makes an important commentary on the post-incarceration process of not only mental hospitals, but prisons also.The Director's Cut of Sling Blade, even at a weighty 148 minutes, and despite its slow pace, is gripping film-making. Thornton's tragic tale is an outstanding mixture of memorable performances, a sharp script, and arresting direction, and rather than swerving at the final traffic straight, he takes us on a largely smooth, occasionally bumpy ride that makes note of several of the many things wrong with society. With Thornton writing, directing and starring in this film, each with their own flare and ingenuity, the term \"tour de force\" is rarely more apt. Sling Blade, whilst perhaps too sedate for some, is a gallant effort that achieves in every manner that a film of this ilk should.",

He effortlessly seems to become Karl i.e. I never once thought that the actor Thornton was on my screen.I think the most impressive and at the same disturbing aspect of this film was its ability to shame me. I was ashamed of the fact that I was waiting for the moment that Karl would go in to a violent frenzy and was wondering which characters would suffer his wrath. At the same time, I was aware of my 'shortcomings' and was constantly hoping that it wouldn't come to that. Of course, it was excellent writing and acting that had me thinking at the back of my mind that a violent outburst was on its way.As the relationship between Doyle and Linda slowly took the inevitable downward spiral, I realised that there would be no happy ending. The way in which it happened surprised me completely though. No frenzied blood bath, no signs of enjoyment from Karl. Just two simple blows and the job was finished. The fact that he had asked Doyle what to do afterwards simply blew my mind.Clues were given throughout the entire film as to Karl's persona, his level of understanding and intelligence. Whilst he struggled with some of the basic day to day things, his insight in to human nature surpassed most of the other characters in the film.Within minutes of the film starting, I felt I had been touched, that I was watching a very special story unfold. I found myself trying to imagine what the best ending would be. Would they all live happily ever after? Would Karl wear Doyle's scalp as a hat and drive through 3 states in an open top? (OK, maybe not quite so severe!). Nah, these endings would have destroyed what was a very delicate story. Karl's sacrifice for the boy and his mum was the perfect ending in my opinion.Apart from BBT, there were some other great performances, particularly the boy and the gay friend. In fact I found only one part in the entire film to stand out as slightly 'forced' which was when Karl's boss comments on the speedy repair of the mower stating that the other guy said it wasn't repairable. Apart from that, 10/10 for the acting.Thanks to BBT for giving me the opportunity to see this great film.",

Then reality hit Karl hard, once he meets the boy's mean-spirited violent step-father (Dwight Yoakam).

Which Thornton adapted from a short film, he wrote titled \"Some Called It a Sling Blade\". Which the short film is directed by George Hickenlooper. Thornton received an Oscar from Best Adapated Screenplay from his extended script. He was also nominated for Best Actor.Once of the reasons why the movie is memorable is the rich performances by Thornton, Black, Yoakam and especially the late John Ritter in a terrific unusual role. There's also good roles from the small characters parts like the late J.T. Walsh, James Hampton, Brent Briscoe, filmmaker:Jim Jarmusch and Oscar-Winner:Robert Duvall. This is certainly a true labor of love for Thornton, who made this real one of a kind independent film that is beautifully done. One of the best movies in the 1990's. Don't miss this winner.

His script is both moving and compelling, his direction certain, and his performance is a disciplined exercise in consistency. It is only in the weightier area that \"Sling Blade\" lets itself down.Thornton tries to deal with the nuances of right and wrong in terms that are too simple. Much of the film is dedicated to justifying old Sling Blade's actions, as Billy Bob extols the virtues of necessary evil. Never mind, nobody's perfect.Good support comes from an auxiliary cast including Dwight Yoakam, Natalie Canerday, Lucas Black and Robert Duvall. This is always Billy Bob's show however.

Walsh is also subtle and menacing as Carl Childer's cellared at the state asylum, when discussing what he did to get there.The incidental music as Carl is telling Frank (Lucas Black) about why he never had a brother and how the child died is extremely sad. Robert Duvall is Carl's abusive father, who lives in squalor in the backwoods of Georgia. The ditch where a baby was buried still remains in the barn, and Carl visits it, recalling the horrors he survived.There is some comic relief also; Carl orders french fries from the Tasty Freeze- his favorite place. John Ritter befriends Carl, and remarks how deep he seems: Carl grunts and asks for more potted meat from the \"Dollar store\". The Dollar store seems to be the main source of employment in this desolate Georgia town. Anyone who has driven through southwestern Georgia will agree.All in all, worth another viewing. Lucas Black is excellent as the young boy, living in poverty with his mother, who relates and befriends Carl Childers. 9/10.",

            "content": "It would be missing the forest for the trees to merely state that the story of Thornton's film and/or the performances were stunning.No doubt the screenplay is good, if not captivating, in structure. The prologue before the credits balances the measured calmness that pervades the prologue of the film. Both segments have an uneasy and unreal muteness that is deafening to the viewers' sensibilities. The chair dragged by J.T. Walsh makes a noise that irritates you, while preparing you for the rest of the movie. The deliberately darkened room for the interview with the school girl seemed out-of-place for an inmate about to be released into the sunny world of freedom. The screenplay does seem to dig at a layer beyond the obvious\u0097the corrections system that is far from perfect. The response of the lead character to J.T. Walsh at the end of the movie offers more for the viewer to re-evaluate what has preceded in the film. Having viewed Lars von Trier's \"Dogville,\" within hours of viewing \"Sling blade\" one cannot but the see the parallels that emerge in both films\u0097the vigilante element in the best among us and a critical appraisal of society we live in. Is it the sick person that takes the center stage or is the sick framework in our society taking the spotlight? Neither film is religious but both are asking humanistic and theological questions of the viewer.Thornton's performance is interesting and in many ways comparable to Malkovich's performance in \"Of mice and men\" or Duvall's performance in \"To kill a mockingbird.\" Are the viewers mesmerized by the actor's performance or by the writer Thornton's character? In my view the character Karl in \"Sling blade\" is more interesting than the performance of Thornton. The director Thornton exploits the physical imperfections of the actor Thornton. Unlike Giullieta Masina in \"La Strada\" or Sir John Mills in \"Ryan's Daughter\", the rare examples the performances outdid the character, Thornton, Malkovich and Duvall have all presented powerful imperfect characters that interest the viewer more than the performers. Thornton was able to gain the viewer's attention with his gait (with crushed glass in his shoes), his voice, and his facial contortions. In my view, Thornton was more impressive as an actor in \"Monster's ball\" because the character was less \"attractive\" to the viewer.Thornton's cast weave a quilt of outstanding brief performances: J.T. Walsh in the hospital, Duvall as the father, and Ritter as the endearing gay character.More than the performance or the screenplay, the finest part of the film was the music. Now Thornton himself was a drummer and musician. Thornton the director was able to get top-notch strains of music from Daniel Lanois that embellished the film. I think the film would have been a lot less impressive without the music which was evocative and but not intrusive. This includes the singing during the baptism.Thornton needs to be commended for his care in managing the sound throughout the movie. Apart from the dragging of the chair at the start of the film, the sound department did a marvelous job (you see this in films of Michael Mann, Terence Mallick and Julie Taymor among contemporary US filmmakers).All in all, the movie belonged to Billy Bob Thornton\u0097director, screenplay writer, and actor. An amazing effort indeed, almost recalling the more sophisticated effort of Orson Welles in \"Citizen Kane\"!",

When listing my favorite movies of all-time . . . this film consistently struggles for the lead role.Carl, a man seemingly down 3 quarts, (Billy in disguise) has committed the violent murder of his mother and her lover during sex, because the bible had taught him that what he witnessed was so wrong, and he had acted in the only way he knew how. (Didn't God strike down those that sinned?) The next 30 years were spent locked up, studying the bible and trying desperately to grasp and understand where he went wrong. \"Aahh don't understand all the bible, but Aahh reckon' Aahh understand most of it\".And so this simple man is released into a society that amazingly seems to find a place for him and his potential menace. He befriends certain townsfolk (including John Ritter in obviously his greatest role), and a boy (and his mother) who sees him as a possible protector. He reveals to the boy a story about what his father made him do to his just born brother that is so frightening, it may be one of the most movingly horrifying moments in film history. Carl has tried the Old Testament approach to life and ended up in prison. Now begins his New Testament attempt, and he wants to emulate the Christ-like virtues he's embraced . . . first by visiting, and somehow forgiving, his sick and pathetic still barely living father, Robert Duval (although he does admit that he thought of killing him for what he'd made him do to \"the little feller\").He's come to the conclusion that forgiveness, and personal sacrifice, is Christ's and the Bible's greatest lesson, and he crystallizes this when he charges into the bedroom of the boy's mother and her cowardly evil boyfriend (Dwight Yoakam) holding a hammer (Jesus the carpenter), and announcing that he had to be baptized. He's soon baptized, and realizes that his God-given role and road to personal redemption is to sacrifice himself and his freedom (back to prison) by saving the boy and his mother from their inevitable fate. He understood the bible as something to be lived and acted upon . . . unlike most.I've almost never seen a movie where \"every\" scene made me want to laugh and cry and cheer and scream . . . seemingly at the same time. The humor is everywhere despite the gruesome emotional horror and the spiritual undertones that continually direct the movie to it's conclusion . . . Carl's self-sacrifice out of deep love and need for redemption . . . a masterpiece of the highest order in the world of Art.Congrats Mr Thornton.....and thank you very much.",

            "content": "\"Sling Blade\" is a film that takes you well outside the confines of your every day movie experience, and well outside your comfort zone as a passive participant in what unfolds on screen. Through the character of Karl Childers (Billy Bob Thornton), one is forced to examine one's own concepts of normal behavior and innate human decency. Because even though Karl is mentally defective, he has an uncanny ability to see through the clutter of disaffected lives and get directly to the point about what's right and wrong. I don't think I've ever watched a scene from a movie so excruciatingly heart rending as Karl's description about burying his newborn sibling. All the while, I couldn't help feeling that maybe there wasn't anything wrong with that baby, other than Karl's father not wanting it around to become another Karl someday. You put yourself in Karl's shoes as he searches around the shed where he lives to find a shoe box to serve as a coffin, and it's impossible not to well up and choke back a tear for all the inhumanity in the world that goes on day after day. Maybe that's a little more than Thornton the writer and director meant to convey, but that sense comes through nevertheless, at least for me.And yet, there are times in the film when you just can't hold back laughter at the utter incongruity of it all. Like the time Karl tries to recreate the bathroom joke about the two guys on the bridge. Karl just mashes it all to hell as Linda Wheatley knowingly responds \"I'll be dog\". Well now, I don't know if that makes any sense at all, but I just couldn't help busting a gut over that one. Or how about young Frank Wheatley (Lucas Black) as he tries one last time to make an impression on his sweetheart crush. He knows it's futile, but summons the courage to bring her a cheap bouquet from the five and dime. Thornton captures the angst of growing up and trying to be accepted in such a simple scene and does it in a way that parallels Karl's own experience.Now even when you figure out how the movie is going to end, the anticipation of getting there is what makes the journey compelling. The shock, if there is one, lies in the same matter of fact approach that Karl applies to his everyday life. There is not so much a pre-meditation about what Karl will do, but more a sense of what the situation demands to protect the family that has come to love and accept him as one of their own. \"Sling Blade\" is a remarkable film. Without it, I don't know if Billy Bob Thornton would have even crossed our radar yet as an artist. But here, in one stroke, Thornton makes his mark on our consciousness with a bold and brilliant story that challenges our perceptions and makes us think, and that's a rare commodity today.",

It's a simple story that is mainly supported on the shoulders of one odd character. But Thornton's performance is so compelling that accompanied by his laudable writing and directing Sling Blade is a moving and also entertaining film. Each scene takes it's time to draw all it can out of it and the film ponders it's way to a 135 minute runtime. However, despite its unusually long length for such a film, at no point does Sling Blade seem to drag. The film makes use of every minute and invests towards its emotional and thoughtful style.Thornton's is certainly the most notable and best performance in this film, so much so that it might drown out those around him. The two cast members who stick out the most are those who come from an unsteady background: Dwight Yoakim and Lucas Black. One is a country music star and the other a kid. Actors under these classifications are often times subpar, but Yaokim and Black don't just do well for their type they succeed as plain actors.When Thornton wrote this film he certainly seemed to have a clear vision in mind and it looks like he achieved his goal.

            "content": "It's an unusual flick, written and directed by Billy Bob Thornton, and starring Billy Bob Thornton. He's written himself a juicy role, the kind that wins awards, and he gives it everything he's got.Thornton is a newly released psychiatric patient who had killed his mother and her lover when he was twelve, thinking that she was being raped. Now free after twenty years, he wanders back into a town that regards him at first with suspicion, even though few remember his crime.You can hardly blame the good folks of Dogpatch. They're mostly polite, earnest, God-fearing sons of the soil, while Thornton has a closely shaven head, a chin that is so far jutted out that you could play a hand of solitaire on it, and a maniacal smile fixed to his face. On top of that, he speaks in a voice like that of someone gargling pebbles and he ends his utterance with a lunatic \"Mmm-HMMM.\" He doesn't walk so much as creep, and he rarely looks people in the eye.A stunner of a performance in a film that nicely captures the veneer of politesse and generosity that masks the wellsprings of violence in a small Southern town.I don't think I'll describe too much of the plot. The movie is overlong and the screenplay puts Thornton in the middle of all the rituals and intrigues of small town society. He gets to meet his estranged father, he gets baptized, he gets to meet a slow salesgirl at the local Dollar Store, he serves as a surrogate father to a young boy.The ending is a bit abrupt, as if the screenwriter couldn't think of a truly satisfying ending. As it is, it's a big improvement over Thornton's falling in love with the retarded salesgirl and living happily ever after in a rose-covered cottage. Nobody weeps. There is little sentimentality on display. Only once does the closed-mouthed Thornton begin to spout what sound a little too much like folk poetry. \"Thet there boy lives in his hort and there ain't much room in there fer him.\" We know fairly soon who's good and who's bad. That's rather a weakness. Yet there really IS only one bad guy, Dwight Yoakam, the singer, who gives a scary performance as the abusive, hateful suitor who dislikes whimpering kids and retards. Of course, when he's bad, he's very, very bad, but he tries to be good, really he does. And he features in a comic scene in which he gets his cowboy band together and they play the lousiest music that ever assailed the human ear, and later argue about which of their works is most poetic.Some of the film could have been condensed. Thornton doesn't make it with the salesgirl. Okay. It takes ten minutes to establish that in the film. It could have been dealt with in one or two. The baptism doesn't signal any change in Thornton's character. It just pads the film out and renders it sluggish, like the muddy stream in which the born again are dunked. I suspect the scenes were ornamental enactments of Billy Bob Thornton's childhood memories of Arkansas. He must have thought them sensitive and evocative but, as an obscure writer said, \"Kill all your darlings.\"",

Canerday brings great heart to the naively kind mom, and Ritter immense strength to the bashful and outcast homosexual.Around this core spin a dizzying array of bit-parts including J.T. Walsh as Karl's creepy fellow inmate, Christy Ward as his would-be date, a troupe of real musos downplaying as Doyle's buddies in the worst band in the world plus cameos from Robert Duvall as his father and Jim Jarmusch as the paper-hatted Mr. Frostee Cream man.In the eye of this menacing sorry is the pivotal and gobsmacking performance of Thornton himself - transformed into a stooped and grimacing man with a voice like Popeye - as a man whose inherent goodness (and love for French fried 'taters) is balanced by the threat of extreme violence.Behind the camera Thornton turns oddballs into heroes, behind the script he makes a very simple tale work on so many levels - as morality play, as black comedy, and hard-hitting social commentary.

But he's written a great role for himself, and he acts it well without vanity or sentimentality.  And the good part of his direction is the way he handles the other actors, particularly Lucas Black, John Ritter(whom I'm not a big fan of), and Dwight Yoakam.  Robert Duvall and J.T. Walsh put in nice cameo appearances as well.  And the music score written and produced by Daniel Lanois was haunting as well, particularly when Emmylou Harris hums \"Shenendoah\" while Karl is being baptized, since she definitely has the voice of an angel.",

            "content": "Best film of 1996 for me, as 4 of our best actors came together in this unlikely magic story...... Billy Bob Thornton, J.T. Walsh, John Ritter, and Robert Duvall . All were superb, and 2 are now dead but never forgotten.My mother grew up in the same area where Sling Blade was set, so I admit I am biased toward those country people as I know how good, decent, unselfish and kind they are. Carl Childers, a simple and mentally challenged man, but one with a very strong sense of right and wrong, was Billy Bob's odd character, and made us all relate with great compassion and sympathy for his plight. Yes, he was a double killer in his youth, but for good reason according to Carl and the Bible, which Carl steadfastly followed in anything involving moral issues and followed to the letter when he killed his mother and a man not her husband for fornication he saw as wrong. He used a \"sling blade\", a scythe, for the job. He was then sent to a \"nervous hospital\" where another inmate, J.T. Walsh, played to the hilt a depraved and boastful, pedophile fellow inmate. John Ritter, in a marvelously nuanced performance as a gay man stuck in a small town, played the best friend of the mother of the young boy Carl befriended after he was released from the hospital after almost 20 years. Duvall did a short but necessary bit as Carl's insane father. Also, country music's Dwight Yoachim played a small role as the mother's cruel and selfish boyfriend who harshly and \"sharply\" found out later that he shouldn't have been that way.This simple, slice of life story of a simple man trying to make a go of life on the outside was so rich and involving as it told of Carl's short stay back in society, one that was cut short due to another attack of unyielding morality in Carl that resulted in another murder, one also justified in Carl's mind. But, the kind and caring uncle/big brother connection between Carl and the young boy made us know his true inner self, and as we became more and more sympathetic to Carl we wished so much that his life would have turned out so much better than it did. And, sometimes I get the notion that maybe the world would be a better place if all wrong and immorality was as simply and quickly dealt with as Carl did it. \"Do a wrong crime, pay the big price\". Maybe it's the rest of us who are nuts.",

It's a shame that the construction of the film does not match the standards of his own performance, or indeed of the also excellent acting he induces from the rest of his cast (especially Dwight Yoakam, who's improbably good). But the pace is very slow, the inevitable end is heavily telegraphed, while as a whole the film is encumbered by a solemn earnestness rarely seen in real life. The horrific situation that unfolds is believable, but sufficiently extreme as to lose the moral complexity that might otherwise inhere in this drama; and there's also the occasional misfiring note (Carl is supposed to be a whizz at fixing engines: he demonstrates this by telling his co-workers to remember to put petrol in them!). 'Sling Blade' is not a bad film, but a slightly lighter touch would not have gone amiss. It still achieved enough to make Thornton's reputation as among the more talented actors in modern American cinema.",

            "content": "I've seen Billy Bob Thorton's work before: 'Tombstone'(1993), 'Armageddon' (1998), 'Pushing Tin' (1999), and 'Bad Santa' (2003) among others. While Thorton appeared a capable actor, I never could appreciate why he was so revered in the mid to late 90's.Until I finally witnessed 'Sling Blade' 15 years later after its release.The film itself, about a mentally challenged man sent to a mental institution for the criminally insane at the age of 12 and life after his release, is about as complete a film as you will ever find. The dialog is superb, the settings are superb, camera work is superb. The supporting characters are superb even though some of the acting leaves something to be desired. They often feel sweet and disarming which seems to contrast with the fine acting skills brought by Thorton and other main characters.The choice of shots is often gripping when they are unexpected. Most of the film is unremarkable in angles and use of perspectives but every once in awhile, at just the right moment, the director gets you. There is a bridge Thorton's character Karl crosses. The bridge is shown twice and Karl pauses in the same place each time at the vertex of two trusses. These shots are visually engrossing as your eye cannot help but follow the lines leading to this character you grow to admire and love.The dialog is unadorned. Language is not used to impress but to express the character's personality without any pretension. I particularly find two scenes engrossing. The first is a domestic argument between Linda Wheatley who took Karl in and her abusive boyfriend Doyle. We see Linda take a stand which belied the inner strength we thought she did not possess but she never cursed; she just stood her ground and let her son Frank, who was about 12, throw cans at Doyle and vent his bottled anger at him. Another is a well referenced interplay between Frank and Karl. When anyone asks why Frank likes Karl the answer is simple: \"I like the way he talks.\" After Karl moves into Linda's garage, Frank states \"I like the way you talk,\" to which Karl replies \"I like the way you talk too.\" The entire movie avoids delusions of grandeur by any of its characters which allows us to fully appreciate what they try to say instead of admiring how they say it.The plot is divine but the real gem of this movie is the gifts Billy Bob Thorton delivered. His character Karl is indelible and will likely eternally live on as a classic. As the screenwriter and director, Thorton knew at all turns what he wanted from each character and the actors selected were fantastic. John Ritter as Vaughn, Dwight Yoakum as Doyle, Robert Duvall as Karl's father and other accomplished actors kept to the simple idea of being nothing more than their character warranted. In the end, the simple prevailed and the climax was the most satisfying anti-climax ever; the most appropriate description for it may be 'sublime'.I still do not have an appreciation for Billy Bob Thorton as a person but I can now say about his rocket rise to praise and fame: \"Now I get it.\" It has been 15 years and in my opinion, 'Sling Blade' is already a classic.",

Two outwardly very different people who In fact share a lot of un-happiness. Not just Thornton but the whole thing Is so damn simple - In a good way that gives It real feeling. Dwight Yoakim's Doyle, the prime nasty character gets what he deserves - namely to be used like a watermelon. Both the friends have a lot to deal with and true to life just try and get along as best they can. Carl doesn't really have anything aside from his new \"family\" but the end Is still a hugely noble action concluding a brilliant human story. Lucas Black puts In an accomplished performance as the kid Frank alongside Billy Bob's peculiar presence. Vaughn Is a cracking character, there's no more room In the closet, In the cafe he even has Carl down as a bit of a plilosopher! Jim Jarmusch appears through a fast food hatch to Ignite Carl's love of potato chips mm-hmm and J.T Walsh Is sinister as the depraved pervert. Carl winds up right where he started, glaring out the window listening to the ramblings of a proper sicko. Carl Is asked what he did when out, \"met a boy\" he replies. \"I bet you did\" Walsh leers back oozing turgid thoughts.

When she apprised him of the facts, he killed her too.Mmm hmm.So Karl spends twenty-five years in the state mental institution and then they let him go. He has improved himself and learned to read. He's read the Bible and he reckons he understands it, mostly. He meets a boy and they become best buds showering one another and the audience with \"idiot savant\" and \"precocious child\" bits of phony wisdom. Sometimes it gets so corny you just want to blush for the players. This is not to say that the script has no redeeming qualities. It does, especially the first, last and penultimate scenes-and there are some nice touches in between. But overall it's heavy-handed and insufferably preachy.The main problem is Billy Bob himself, who also wrote the script and directed. If it can be said that the man who acts as his own lawyer has an idiot for a client, then perhaps it can be said that the star who directs himself has no guidance as an actor. Thornton's performance (upper lip buried in lower, dead pan voice, etc.) is more mannerism than substance. In the beginning he had the timing down very well when Karl was saying little, but later on when Karl started dispensing all that wisdom, he had to talk faster and it started to come out phony. There's a great temptation, when writing of the down-trodden to cover ourselves with them, like the flag, and unabashedly champion the underdogs of society without regard for reality. When that happens we have a political movie, an \"I'm in favor of motherhood\" editorial instead of a film. Thornton falls into this trap as he attempts to catapult the second class citizens of our society halfway to sainthood over the straw body of bigots and the usual small town mentality. Consequently, both Karl and the boy become far too wise, too sensitive, too considerate, too loving and frankly, too saintly to be believed.I'm not sure that anything could have allowed this movie to live up to the PC adoration given it, but Thornton might have helped his cause by cutting some of Karl's more goody-goody pronouncements, and by giving more time and scope to the other characters, especially the boy's mother (Natalie Canerday) who is too narrowly presented. He had a very fine cast: he should have used them more and himself less.Dwight Yoakam was properly despicable as the insufferably self-centered, woman-battering, bigoted boyfriend of the boy's mother. John Ritter was close to brilliant as a small town, thirtysomething gay. J.T. Walsh, as a psychopathic rapist/murderer, was sardonically humorous, and Robert Duvall's cameo as Karl's falling-down poor white trash father was good (as far as it went). Lucas Black, who played the boy was excellent. In short, the cast carried the film, and if Thornton had given them more depth and himself less he might have had a work of art.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book \"Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!\" Get it at Amazon!)",

When I saw the it had scored 8.0 on IMDb I figured I would rush out to see it.Perhaps, rather stupidly, I sat down to watch a masterpiece. I was therefore a little disappointed when the credits rolled at the end of the picture that I felt underwhelmed.Now, don't get me wrong. This is a good movie without question. I felt parts of it were utterly brilliant, but I also felt that parts of it were really rather weak.The Good Without question the standout element of the picture is the performance of Billy Bob Thorton. So good was he that I had a hard time believing it was even Thorton himself! His performance as Karl is a masterclass. Subtle, careful and quiet, yet able to convey the many emotions bubbling under the character's surface. The opening monologue is outstanding.A shout out must also go to then teenage actor Lucas Black, whose performance as the young lad Frank is worthy of almost any adult actor in Holdwood today. I thought he was excellent.I thought the score fit the movie perfectly, and, far from it being a slow movie, found the pacing just right....and tribute to THorton's talents as a director.The Not So Good.I was surprised to find out that the script won and academy award. Frankly I find it the weakest part of the movie. After the first third of the movie I had worked out the conclusion and that left me feeling disappointed. By third of the way it it was clear the the character of Karl was not going to undergo any particular major changes in the movie, and once Dwight Yokam's Doyle character showed up the writing was on the wall.To be honest, I am not entirely sure what message Thorton is trying to convey with his script, beyond the obvious, that he can't cope or fit in on his own so works out a way to return himself to the mental hospital, but understands basic good and evil, if not the wrong doing of murder. I know people with learning difficulties and I found the way the Karl character switches from seeming understanding and lucidity at times to otherwise total inability to function a bit inconsistent, but, like I say, this is a script issue, rather than one of performance.I also felt some of the supporting characters added little to the story, particularly those of JT Walsh's sex offender and Robert Duvall's father (who I really had hoped to learn more about), which is a shame because they really are fine and talented actors.Conclusion The picture could have been a masterpiece, but for it's obvious predictability. Quite simply I did not find that I had to think too much to understand the movie and so for that reason alone I can't treat it as being a 10/10. I therefore give it a 7.",

            "content": "I've just seen this movie more than 10 years after it was released.I'd heard about it and it was as good as the hype I'd heard.It was written,directed and starred in by Billy Bob Thornton.Billy Bob plays a mentally challenged man,Karl,who must try to fit back into society after a long stay in a mental hospital.He gets a job in a repair shop and soon becomes friends with a boy and his mom and moves into their garage.Also hanging around is the moms abusive boyfriend,superbly played by Dwight Yokem.I guess the most impressive thing about this movie is the superb acting of everyone involved.Billy Bob is terrific as Karl and Yokem is perfect as the boyfriend who is determined to make everyone around him as miserable as he is.Haven't we all known insecure rednecks who hate everyone because their own life is a pointless hateful mess?Yokem nails this guy perfectly.John Ritter plays a gay man and it was good to see just how well the late actor could play a serious part when he had the chance.No one looks much like themselves in this film.It would be hard to tell who Thornton,Yokem and Ritter are if you didn't know they were in this film.And the small town life is captured really well by this film.The only problems I had with the movie was that some of the lines Thornton wrote for the young boy were just too sappy and maudlin at times.No self respecting 11 year old boy is gonna say some of the stuff that this one said.But that is a minor thing.The other problem was that as soon as I saw the abusive boyfriend I knew what the outcome was going to be.Maybe that is my fault for thinking too much ahead instead of just watching the film.But again that is a minor thing.All in all I really enjoyed this film.But seeing it in 2007 I have to wonder what has happened to Billy Bob in the last 10 or 11 years since this movie came out? Anybody who can write and direct and star in a movie of this caliber obviously has some talent. So why is Thornton wasting his time and talents on crap like \"Bad Santa\" and \"School for Scoundrels\"? But even if Thornton never does another decent movie at least he has \"Sling Blade\" to his credit.And that ain't bad,uh-huh.",

            "content": "We know well the visage of the desolate, decadent, sometimes lascivious Southern landscape from the works of William Faulkner and others. Not unlike Faulkner, Billy Bob Thornton's Sling Blade guides us guiltily toward the region's historical and modern undercurrents of social prejudices, ignored dysfunction, sought acceptance, and resulting violence. The film addresses a universal human condition, however, and not the region.The title of the film looms over the audience as Thornton urges fondness while successfully negotiating the fine line between our fear of, and affection for Karl Childers (Thornton), a recently released mental patient committed as a child for violently murdering his mother and her boyfriend. Sling Blade is a study in tension with thick suspense built through superior character development resulting in conflicts that escalate into deliberate, almost real-time rhythms.The story is one of need and moreover of acceptance, as the collection of limping characters, directly or not, seek it, and to some degree, with the help of Karl, attain it. The boy, Frank (Lucas Black), seeks the love of a father figure after the suicide of his own. Linda, the mother (Natalie Canderday), requires the general acceptance of her perceived role as a Southern woman, and subsequently the acceptance from a mate, which is evident in her destructive dependence upon her demonic, red-neck boyfriend, Doyle (Dwight Yoakam). Her own deep need renders her perhaps overly accepting of others, including Karl, whom most mothers wouldn't let within ten feet of there sons. Vaughn (John Ritter), like the others, seeks love, and on an outward scale, struggles with his half-open homosexuality in the small Southern town. Doyle, not unlike Linda, wants acceptance of his perceived role as a family head and wants to be loved as well, but lacks even the basic tools to a gain it. And finally Karl, the most dynamic character in the film, seeks acceptance only from himself as he works to garner love and to construct some semblance of a life within the limited bounds of his mental capacity, his stunted development, and his own set of morals.While the climax of the film is somewhat telegraphed, it is more inevitable than predictable, and the audience is left alone with the wonderment and self-examination over the questionable choice of a sympathetic character. From Sling Blade we leave with the unsolicited lesson that tenderness and brutality sometimes share the same origin.",

            "content": "Small, independently produced cinematic gems such as Billy Bob Thornton's \"Sling Blade\" rarely have a chance to shine when competing for big-screen space in the multiplexes against those luminous, mega-budgeted, celebrity studded Hollywood features. In the same category, equally brilliant but dark-minded thrillers such as \"Fargo\" and \"Lone Star\" seldom find their audiences until they take up shelf space at your local video rental store. Most moviegoers simply don't know what they've missed because these movies don't have the giant advertising budgets of \"Star Wars\" or \"Jerry Maguire.\" Sadly, like \"Fargo\" and \"Lone Star,\" \"Sling Blade\" may suffer a similar demise. This is a real shame because these little movies deserve a better fate.Basically, if you never watched another movie in a theatre, you should see \"Sling Blade.\" This movie is that good! Comparatively, in Hollywood terms, \"Sling Blade\" crosses the goofy Tom Hanks' comedy \"Forrest Gump\" with the classic 1976 Robert De Niro psycho-chiller \"Taxi Driver.\" If your tastes run to literature, the \"Sling Blade\" plot resembles something that Southern Gothic writers such as William Faulkner and Flannery O'Conner might have cooked up.When we meet Karl Childers (Billy Bob Thornton of \"On Deadly Ground\"), he is about to be released from the state mental hospital. A retarded adult, Karl was committed when he was a child for hacking up his mother and her illicit lover with a sling blade. Our cretinous hero thought that his mama was being raped by a neighbor, when she was actually cheating on her husband. Karl has been behind bars for 25 years, so life in the free world holds little prospect for him. Although he wants to remain in the state hospital, the warden refuses to let him.Karl looks harmless enough. He wears his britches too high and his socks too low. He's a gravel-voiced, mild-mannered brute that learned to read the Bible and has a flair for fixing small motors. The warden of the state hospital, Jerry Woolridge (James Hampton of \"The Longest Yard\") finds him work at a repair shop in a rural town that could double for Andy Griffith's Mayberry. Karl befriends a fatherless youngster, Frank Wheatley (Lucas Black) and the boy's homely mother Linda Wheatley (Natalie Canerday of \"Biloxi Blues\"). She dates a drunken boyfriend, Dole Hargraves (Dwight Yoakum) who not only cheats on her but enjoys abusing her. At her son's request, Linda lets Karl bunk in their garage because Frank likes the way Karl talks. \"His voice,\" Linda observes, \"sounds like a race track.\" Karl and Linda's boyfriend Doyle don't see eye to eye. Eventually, the mean-spirited beau evicts Karl, but like Tom Hanks' retarded by savvy Forrest Gump character, Billy Bob Thornton's Karl conceals more common sense than most folks can imagine. Karl knows the vile Doyle is a snake, and Karl vows to protect young Frank and Frank's innocent mother from him.The eccentric \"Sling Blade\" cast could be refugees from TV's \"Hee Haw.\" Incredibly enough, their Southern accents sound as genuine as their performances are sincere. Karl dates a monstrous cow of a woman who constantly complains about her feet. In a role reversal, she brings Karl the bouquet of flowers. Oscar-winning actor Robert Duvall of \"The Godfather\" has a cameo has Karl's chair-ridden, good-for-nothing father who made him bury his prematurely born younger brother in a shoe box out in the backyard. Comedian John Ritter of the vintage ABC-TV sitcom \"Three's Company\" really stretches himself with an absolutely brilliant but low-key performance as Vaughan Cunningham, a bespectacled, pot-bellied homosexual. Ritter plays this difficult but outrageous role totally straight (pardon the pun), sparkling in a role that you'd never think he'd have the guts to accept. Although the other movie characters ridicule Ritter and his affair with the town mortician, the Billy Bob Thornton screenplay sympathizes with his character and shows him in a favorable light. County singer Dwight Yoakum drips pure evil as Linda's scummy boyfriend who carps on everybody for being less perfect that he is.Thornton, a gifted character actor who has appeared in minor film parts, delivers a finely tuned performance that has justifiably earned him a Best Actor Oscar nomination. Previously, Thornton played the nasty gambler in \"Tombstone\" and one of the short-lived, oil-rig villains in the Steven Seagal thriller \"On Deadly Ground.\" Not only does Thornton excel as Karl, but he also penned the script (for which he has also received an Oscar nomination) and directed this wonderfully poignant story, too. \"Sling Blade\" is a rare visual treat with several nice touches cleverly woven into the either background or the foreground and Thornton lets his cast dominate the action. The scene where the teenage drives the drunken boyfriend out of the house is so convincingly depicted that you feel like an intruder eavesdropping on the real thing.Perhaps what makes \"Sling Blade\" seem so authentic is that everything here could really happen. No special effects, no auto chases, or big action scenes clutter up this simply spun, but devastating evocative saga.",

He makes friends with a boy & his mother (Natalie Canerday) and they let him live in their garage, but the mother's abusive boyfriend presents a problem (Dwight Yoakam). John Ritter is on hand as the mother's gay best friend.\"Sling Blade\" (1996) is a small town drama with a memorable central character (if I didn't know beforehand that Thornton played the role, I wouldn't have recognized him). The characters and their situations smack of real life while the unhurried story is interesting enough. There are well-done moments of meditation and revelation, as well as touching ones.It's a tad overlong, however, and the politically correct glorification of Vaughan (Ritter) is eye-rolling. Karl (Thornton) observes that \"The Bible says two men ought not lay together. But I don't reckon the Good Lord would send anybody like you to Hades.\" Yet his opining doesn't mean much since he candidly acknowledges elsewhere that he doesn't understand a lot of the Scriptures, not to mention his foolish predilection for murder to solve mundane problems. He should stick to fixing lawnmowers and eating them French fried potaters, mmm-hmm.The film runs 2 hours, 15 minutes, and was shot in Benton & nearby Haskell, Arkansas, which are about 20-30 minutes southwest of Little Rock.GRADE: B-",

            "content": "This movie came out in 1996 and I wish I had caught it earlier on, but alas, I was only able to see it this year in 2022. What first caught my attention about this film were the scenes I recently found on YouTube.I was captivated by Billy Bob Thornton's performance as the mentally challenged man, Karl Childers and his attempt to fit into society again after being locked up in a sanitarium since childhood. I knew then I had to watch it in its entirety so I ordered the DVD online and wasn't disappointed.This is an extremely touching movie about someone with mentally challenged issues who got sent to a mental hospital after committing a violent crime as a boy. Several years later he's deemed fit to return to society and he goes back to his hometown.His adjustment to life beyond the walls of the mental institution aren't easy though. He wanders around aimlessly and even has uncertainty about ordering from a hamburger stand until he decides to try some of those \"French fried potaters\".He eventually runs into and befriends a boy named Frank, wonderfully played by Lucas Black, who immediately takes a liking to Karl and likes the way he talks. That's the most touching part about this film was their friendship.Karl eventually meets Frank's mother, a sweet and kind hearted woman, as well as her \"best friend\", an openly gay man who also happens to be her boss at the local dollar store. John Ritter gives an excellent performance as Vaughan Cunningham, the gay friend who tries to be secretive about his lifestyle even though the whole town already knew about it. He also seemed to act apologetic about it as well. That was evident when he revealed his gay status to Karl with paranoia and discomfort as they had lunch together.The major highlight though was country music superstar, Dwight Yoakam's performance as Doyle, the arrogant and bad tempered boyfriend to Frank's mother. He's a total heel and makes it evidently so with his domineering attitude and extremely insulting way of talking.You can't help, but despise him, especially the cruel comments he makes to Frank and the derogatory way he treats Frank's mother. That evidently showed the serious problems that laid in that household and there were concerns, especially from Vaughn, about the safety of Frank and his mom.Karl moves into their garage and gets a welcoming reception to that except, of course, for Doyle, who wants to take total control of the household and he proves it with his obsessive demands on telling people to \"Get Out!\" whenever he felt like it. Even if it was his girlfriend's place and not his. That causes major problems right there and Karl seems oblivious to it at first, but later, you can see he totally understood.This is indeed a beautiful and heartwarming movie with an excellent cast and a totally original story. Billy Bob Thornton is absolutely convincing as the mentally challenged Karl with his gruff way of talking and his habit of saying, \"Um..Hmm\" after anything he says. He truly is a memorable and unforgettable character. To sum up my review of this excellent film, all I can say is \"Um..Hmm\".",

I recently rented the DVD of \"Bad Santa\" and in one of the special features they made reference to \"Sling Blade\". It had a clip of B.B.T. and John Ritter. The clip was about one minute long and in that one minute i was cracking up. I was curious about the film having never heard of it before. The next day I had to rent it. This was the first movie I have ever watched and said to myself \"damn this guy deserves an Oscar\". Billy Bob Thortons role was by far the best portrayal of a character I have ever seen. I have seen many great actors in many great roles, but I don't think I have ever seen a more intriguing performance. His performance of Karl was absolutely incredible. If I did not know that Karl was being portrayed by Billy Bob I never would have guessed it. It wasn't like most movies where you see the actor and know their acting. I was so swept away by the acting and story of this film I almost forgot I was watching a movie.Judging from the clip I had seen the night before on Bad Santa I was expecting the film to be a comedy. I was very wrong. While the film did make me laugh a few times, it also had me close to tears at times. The film was masterfully done. Billy Bob's writing and directing were also phenomenal. The rest of the cast was great as well. John Ritter, Dwight Yoakum, and the boy who played Frank all gave great performances. I am a big fan of Dwight and his music but hell before the movie was over I wanted him dead LOL.I have read some of the things other users have said about this film. I think a few of them are very narrow minded. Some I think have read more into it than what was really there. There was a lot of stereo typing in the movie but it came only from Doyle. Whats a better way to paint a picture of a bad guy in a small town? I thought the movie displayed southerners to have a lot of heart. Hell these people took in Karl with open arms and gave him work and shelter and he was a complete stranger to them.This movie had no explosions, no special fx, no machine guns, no gratuitous nudity, and none of the other Hollywood gimmicks used to put people into the theatre. This movie was just a superb example of film making. This film exhausted all of ur senses. It made you laugh, it made you cry, it made you feel the suspense, but most of all it made you think.

It is quite uplifting to see BB Thornton and his team at work in this film.The story (though very shortly explained in the short Some Folks Call It a Sling Blade) has a retarted though simple man (Thornton is exceptional as this guy) who gets released from a mental home after 25 years after he killed his mother and her lover.  Soon, be befriends a boy, and so on and so on (if I went on, it would be spoiled).  A very good script, fine direction and quite good acting bring this film to be what it is- BB Thornton's best film yet and also for members of the cast (some of them). A+",

I also thought the film made an odd and heavy-handed anti-abortion statement, though I have since been told that I misinterpreted that part of the dialogue (I can't be sure, since I don't really feel the need to watch the film again).

Before then I felt Thorton was kind of an average actor who was just lucky, but after seeing his incredible performance, direction and writing in 1996's 'Sling Blade' I can tell you that he is one talented guy. Thorton does an impeccable job playing Karl, a mentally-challenged deep-talking man who is released from a mental hospital after being placed there for murdering his mother and her lover when he was a child. Outside, Karl gets a job as a mechanic and befriends a 12-year-old boy Frank (Lucas Black). Frank and his mom are living a seemingly happy existence, until it all goes to hell because of Frank's mom's sick, twisted and abusive boyfriend Doyle (Dwight Yokam) who has threatened murder Frank's mom if she ever tried to leave him. Will Karl be able to maybe save his buddy Frank and his mom from this raving lunatic? Rent it, and see. The film also stars the late-great John Ritter in an excellent performance as Frank's mom's best friend who struggles with being gay, J.T. Walsh as a mentally-disturbed homicidal/rapist maniac who tries to befriend Karl in the mental hospital, and Robert Duvall in a short but none-the-less great part as Karl's long-lost hateful father. Dwight Yokam plays a perfect villain while Lucas Black is very impressive as Frank. I recommend this film very highly if you don't mind seeing kind of a downer. 'Sling Blade' received two Academy Award nominations, one for Best Actor in a Leading Role - Thorton and one for for Best Adapted Screenplay - which it actually ended up winning. 'Sling Blade' is worth watching just on the fact that Thorton gives one of the best handicapped performances of all time in it. Grade: B+MADE MY TOP 300 LIST AT #181",

His performance is truly on a par, at least, with Dustin Hoffman's Raymond in \"Rain Man\" Quite apart from his acting, he also wrote and directed this movie, which ranks in my top ten films of all time at present - A powerful touching drama which dares to combine themes of mental illness, homosexuality and instituationalised prejudice to produce an outstanding and emotionally charged work of art.Every good movie needs a bad guy.

Of course, the machinations of the state governments being the pieces of junk they are, he is basically just thrown away and stumbles into a dysfunctional family that mirrors his own childhood, and the fur flies!Billy Bob is probably the only good that came out of the Clinton Arkansas infestation of the 90s. This is a fine movie, with wonderful acting performances by Billy Bob and Yoakum. Ritter is pretty damn convincing as well. The story isn't too believable, or maybe I don't want to think that. I've certainly known hillbillies like Yoakum's character, but the extreme violent side that Hollywood so loves to put into every bad guy, is really an anomaly thankfully. So I think his character is just a little too over the top for me, but without him or it, of course there's no movie, so you sorta have to suffer it. There are some really great sequences, with superb writing. The way the film gradually enlightens you about the horrors of Carl's upbringing is expertly crafted. But then there are some bits that really bog the movie down, such as the obligatory 'romance' with the obligatory simple girl from the dollar store. Kind of stupid, and it really went nowheres.  And to be real nitpicky, Thornton's portrayal was a bit bizarre in that Carl at times comes across as just too wise and normal. If he's capable of displaying wit, and a decent sense of humor, why doesn't he just act like that all the time? Make sense?",

He was a weenie. All bark and no bite. He wasn't THAT bad enough to be killed, so I couldn't cheer Karl on when he did. (Not like \"The Gift\" when the son almost torched his dad for molesting him for years. His father WAS a pig and deserved payback!!) *******END***********************The use of a gay character as the \"good\" guy in the film was a pleasant surprise. Though why any gay would want to move from St. Louis to the sticks is a mystery to me. Hello, looking for trouble?? There are some good things about this movie.

The short was both sad and terrifying--Karl Childers is shown as being both a traumatized individual whose childhood horrifies us and someone who terrifies us with the thought that he might be walking among us. However, in the film, the character is changed to a Charly-type: slightly mentally slow (although at times very bright and insightful which didn't seem to trouble Billy Bob Thornton as writer or directer at all) but a good hearted and kind person. The characters are all unbelievable.   The main part of the story, Karl's friendship with a young boy, is the most unbelievable part of the story--the boy is not presented as enough of  a \"loser\" to explain  why he would form a friendship with someone like Karl.  Ever seen this happen in real life?  In real life, he would try to raise his standing among his friends by making fun of someone like Karl. Then, we are to believe that, somehow, the mental hospital/prison Karl was in provided nothing in the way of transition living, but somehow he learned small engine repair there well enough to be given a job by (an unbelievably good) person.  Despite being institutionalized most of his life and living in a hole the rest of it, Karl somehow has obtained job skills that would be the envy of many employers.  That's believable? Then, after knowing him for only a few days, Karl informs the boy's mother that he was in prison for murdering two people--including his mother.  The boy's mother reacts as if Karl just told her he was in jail for writing a bad check.  I don't care how nice a person you are, you would be concerned about this and would certainly limit your child's time with someone like this--wouldn't you?  That's believable? Then there is the mother's boyfriend who, in contrast to everybody else in the movie who seems to be a refugee from the set of the Andy Griffith Show, makes Hannibal Lector look like someone who you'd like to see your daughter dating.  He is so one-dimensionally bad that he, too, isn't believable.  You know what is going to happen in the film after about 2 minutes of seeing him.  All you do is wait to see how it happens.  No surprises there! Want another example of how unbelievable the story is? The little hole that Karl dug to sleep in is still nicely preserved in the back shed--even has all the junk conveniently piled around it when he goes back to see it 25 years later.  25 years later?  Junk everywhere, but the little hole is still the way it was? The directing is terrible--just once it would have been nice to see a close-up shot of the actors--just to see if they can really act.  Thorton's acting, powerful in the short film, becomes downright silly as the mannerisms which made him sad and terrifying in the short, seem to occur only sporadically in the movie version. The film is a trite view of the trauma of horrible child abuse and the difficulties people with mental disabilities have coping with life. Do yourself a favor.  See the short--skip the film.",

            "content": "There are those born into this world with a seemingly endless capacity for `life'-- those with the mental wherewithal and ability to embrace and appreciate the endless bounties that nature has to offer.  And then there are those less fortunate; those who lack that acuity of mind and must content themselves with more immediate pleasures, like simply drawing breath in a world that has judged and declared them an accident of birth and has summarily withdrawn it's promise to them, deeming them somehow unworthy, and subsequently refusing to offer them more than the basic sustenances of survival, viewing them too often as so much refuse, with no intrinsic value whatsoever.  An abhorrent philosophy, to be sure, and yet one too often embraced by those better equipped, those who should know better and who should make it their business to reach out and at the very least attempt to discover what even the least among us has to offer, and to offer something in return.  It's a proposition put forth by writer/director/star Billy Bob Thornton, in `Sling Blade,' an emotionally charged drama that seeks out the best within the least of us.  And finds it.After spending his entire adult life in a mental institution because of a crime he committed as a child, Karl Childers (Thornton) has been declared `well,' and is released from the `nervous hospital' (as he calls it) that has been his home these many years.  Born `simple,' the product of morally deficient parents, Karl neither demands nor expects anything from life; indeed, he wouldn't know how to.  His is a life devoid of hopes or dreams, as in point of fact, these are things he does not know even exist.  From the moment of his birth up until the day he entered the institution, Karl's life has been nothing more than a stoic and innate quest for survival.  And now, thrown back into the world, he returns to the small Arkansas town where he grew up.When Karl gets to town and steps off the bus, he is alone and with nowhere to go.  Hungry, he soon discovers the joys of `french fried potaters,' which he gets at a fast food joint.  Circumstances then bring him into contact with a twelve-year-old boy, Frank (Lucas Black), and the two quickly `make friends,' in the purest sense, thanks to Frank's intuitive response, generated by the non judgmental innocence of youth, which allows the boy to see Karl as a person, rather than as an object of disdain.  And this simple act of friendship awakens in Karl something he has never known.  For the first time, perhaps, Karl has a reason to be.Billy Bob Thornton is an enigma; Offstage, he seems perpetually attached to controversy, while as an artist, he never ceases to amaze.  As an actor/filmmaker he has consistently demonstrated true genius, which has never been more apparent than with this film, in which he presents a perspective on life that issues from a depth of staggering proportions. With this story of perfect imperfection, he indicates the possibility that a perfect world can be achieved through the efforts of imperfect people; but that, unfortunately, those who deem themselves as `perfect' must also participate, which results in a world that is ultimately and unavoidable imperfect, and in a way that is forever unalterable.  We are stuck with what we have, then, but the film's message is clear:  we do have choices; and as such, the imperfect can have a positive impact-- through care and understanding, the world can at least be a better place. \nIt's a dramatic statement to make, and Thornton makes it directly, through the insightful presentation of his characters, all of whom are sharply drawn, honest and definitive, and with situations and dialogue that rings true throughout the film.  Still, some of the most telling moments are found in the silence of Karl's reflections; those `moments' that allow the viewer to process and digest the drama of the story as it unfolds, and which adds depth to the overall perspective of how Karl views the world, and how the world views Karl.On the surface, Karl seems as enigmatic as his creator, but it's a perception due mainly to Karl's retiring, undemonstrable countenance, born of the incessant repression of his spirit and any and all vestiges of the humanity alive within him but unable to break free.  In Karl, Thornton has created a character who is something of a study in contradiction, a complex individual who at his core is actually quite simple and uncomplicated, yet possessed of deep-seated emotions fettered by the constraints of his environment and his lack of mental proficiency.  And Thornton so ably conveys the depth of Karl's feelings-- emotions he is so desperately trying to understand and express-- that he becomes oddly endearing and readily evokes the empathy of the audience.  Without question, this is Thornton's most emotionally powerful performance ever, for which he deservedly earned an Oscar nomination for Best Actor (in a year in which Geoffrey Rush took home the gold for `Shine').  Director Thornton supported his dynamic portrayal of Karl by extracting some extraordinary performances from his terrific cast of actors, beginning with the work of young Lucas Black, who presents Frank in terms that are altogether natural and unassuming.  Dwight Yoakam, too, elicits a highly emotional response by creating a character, Doyle Hargraves, who is absolutely insufferable; this is the guy you love to hate.  And John Ritter is effective as the supportive Vaughan Cunningham, turning in a performance that is quite real and convincing, as does Natalie Canerday, as Frank's mother, Linda.Also notable in supporting roles are J.T. Walsh, as one of Karl's fellow mental patients, a loathsome individual named Charles Bushman; James Hampton, as Jerry, the director of the institution; Rick Dial, as Bill Cox; and Brent Briscoe as Scooter Hodges.  A remarkable and unforgettable film, `Sling Blade' is a journey of emotional discovery that is absorbing and absolute.  10/10.",

            "content": "Billy Bob Thornton's intense, nuanced portrayal of the profoundly damaged Karl Childers is what made Charlize Theron's Eileen Wournos possible - a total and flawlessly sustained transformation that urges the viewer to think long and hard about the definition of both criminality and mental illness, helping us understand that murdering someone doesn't necessarily make one a murderer, just as limited intellectual ability doesn't make one 'handicapped'. With nary a trace of the sentimentalism or showboating that plagues similar interpretations (Hoffman's 'Rain Man', Penn's 'I Am Sam'), I found Thornton's Karl to be one of the most lovable characters in all of cinema. So, if your empathy muscles are getting slack from too many oversimplified good/evil, black/white mega-fables, watch this film. It'll leave you not just feeling, but KNOWING that life is really just one big gray area, and that every one of us is an exception to the rule.",

Amazed about performance of B.B.; really cared for this character & how how he was treated.  Still amazing that the old 'Boo Radley' (Duvall) played BB's father.  Duvall was so chilling in 'Mockingbird'; he scared me so much I never saw any more of his movies until 'Sling Blade'.  . . .  Forgive me, I'm one of those unfamous actresses with lots of training . . . John Ritter *really* playing a gay guy this time, LOL (shades of Three's Company). More musings:  never thought a guy named Billy Bob would be a Hollywood star, but who woulda known?  Billy Bob (Karl, I must say) was really cool.  He really cleaned the clock of the bad guy in this movie, so super cool (I'm redundant), then from what I can remember off he goes back again to the mental slammer.  Dwight Yoakam -- a boy from our home town, here (Columbus, Ohio), or so they say.  I didn't know he was an actor.  He gave a very good performance in this movie.  He was so snarlingly wise-ass convincing as the fiance of the boy's mother.  This movie gets a 10.  Any movie where I can watch the whole thing from beginning to end (& many of them are difficult for me), gets a *perfect\".",

He believed at the time that his mother was being raped, and when he realized that she wasn't, he killed her as well. His childhood was horrible, filled with isolation and cruelty.It's time for Karl to be released, and the head of the hospital (James Hampton), knowing Karl has nowhere to go, gets him a job fixing small machines, at which he's an expert. He can also stay in the back of the store. Karl befriends a young boy, Frank (Black), who lives with his young, widowed mother. Karl moves into their garage. Unfortunately, Frank's mother has an abusive boyfriend, Doyle (Yoakam) who makes life hard for the sensitive Frank. She also has a gay friend (John Ritter) who looks out for both of them.Karl thrives in the outside world, becoming more vocal and even making eye contact with people he's speaking with occasionally. The only problem is Doyle, who is a mean drunk and a generally awful person.A fantastic character study of a basically gentle person who is befriended by others because they sense that, despite what he did, he is a simple, good, and caring man. It's a story of people who overlook eccentricities and reach out to him.You can see the denouement coming from a mile away, but that's not really the point of the movie. It's about what society can do to a person, both good and bad.There is no way to adequately describe the acting, which is remarkable. Bill Bob Thornton is so natural as Karl, one forgets it's a performance, as he sits rubbing his hands together and grunting, looking away when he's talking. John Ritter as Vaughan, the gay friend of Frank and his mother, is remarkable. I didn't recognize him at first.The film is filled with poignancy as well as some great humor. It's a very warm movie, despite the offbeat subject matter.Highly recommended. A real tour de force for Thornton, and an excellent film all around.",

            "content": "This movie could have been one of the best movies of the last decade or so. It had a great characterization done by Billy Bob Thornton of a semi-retarded man freed from jail. Unfortunately, all the great potential was destroyed by a poor and inconsistent script. The first sign of flaw was when Thornton's character explained why he was jailed. It was understandable that he killed a man who he believed threatened his Mom and family. However, then he killed his Mom. This made no sense, and indicated that he was a psycho, whom we should not pity. The filmmakers were trying to portray the man in a sensitive light, but in the end they failed. The other characters in the movie were poorly explained. The late John Ritter plays a gay man in a small Arkansas town, who feels a duty to protect a woman and her boy from her boyfriend (Dwight Yoachim). When Ritter's character first meets Thornton's character there is very clear fear of this retarded man on his part. All the fears and stereotypes are there. After Ritter reveals to the retarded man that he is gay, he falls apart and becomes totally empathetic. This makes no sense. The gay man would probably still feel threatened and suspicious until he got to know the retarded man better. The Mom is poorly explained. Whom is she? Whom was her husband? What was he like? Why was she so pacific, and took so much from her boyfriend? What was up with her son? He seemed depressed and like he didn't have any friends? Why was this? These things are never explained. The boyfriend (Yoachim) is poor and stereotypically portrayed. He is the bad guy, abusive boyfriend. No attempt is given to explain why, and even much about why he is a threat to justify the ending of the film. Why were the cops never called in? Even in backwoods Arkansas, in the 90s cops are called at some point. The filmmakers could have at least showed that the cops were overburden and apathetic. At least the cops could have made an appearance and basically did nothing. Why wasn't there more suspicion about the retarded man? He killed his Mom for no really justifiable reason. Why let a \"dangerous\" man walk around with your boy? That isn't today's World. People are absolutely nuts about these kind of things. Basically, they all just trusted the guy. They also know that he killed a man because he thought he was a danger to his family. Okay. So, let the guy stay in a dysfunctional home with a violent tempered boyfriend. That's a one way ticket to a repeat. This is what I would have done differently. I would have cut out the killing of his Mom. It makes Thornton's character less to feel sorry about. I would have not had the killing of the boyfriend at the end. I would have had Thornton's character make a conscientious decision to not resort to violence again. The ending would have been much more meaningful if Thornton's character restrains himself, and the police arrive late to a scene where the boyfriend kills the Mom and her boy. That would have caused the audience to really think about the issue of domestic violence. After all, this was an \"art film\". Why have the sell-out Hollywood ending. I really think with more work this could have been a masterpiece. Unfortunately, it turned out to be an average film.",

            "content": "In a television interview prior to its release, Billy Bob Thornton explained that the idea of 'Sling Blade' began when he was depressed about a four line part he had in an earlier movie. (To my knowledge, he meant the Jim Jarmusch movie \"Dead Man\", in a cameo as one of the nomadic drifters)  From then on, Thornton then claimed to have looked into the mirror with a strange facial expression, and talked to himself in a \"grunted voice,\" similar to that of Karl Childers. He said this gave him the idea for the melodramatic yet highly overrated film, \"Sling Blade.\" But I don't only see the idea coming from that. The plot, at least in my opinion, seemed like an amalgram of several earlier (and better) movies, like David and Lisa, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, and Edward Scissorhands. The feeling of nothingness from playing a miniscule part in a movie is one thing, but a familiar plot, with cliches galore, is another.The film did have good performances, however, particularly the leads, but the \"villainy\" of Dwight Yoakam as Doyle was weak and unconvincing. Add some kudos to chilling atmosphere and an unpredictable ending, but expect an aftertaste shortly after in which you know you just saw a reworking of another idea, told in a different way, and in a different setting.If you want a sugar-sweet sentimental tearjerker, I'd recommend it.

            "content": "Sometimes a hero comes from the most unlikely place.\"Sling Blade,\" the 1996 film written and directed by and starring Billy Bob Thornton, is not an easy film to watch. It's subject matter is serious and nearly every moment of the film is either emotionally intense or so perfectly paced that the film plays with this overwhelming anxiety hanging over it at all times. Then, there's the matter of Thornton's channeling of Karl, a simple man released after years in a \"hospital,\" where he was placed following the murder of his mother and her lover when Karl was 12. It's so deliberate, so intense and so hypnotic that even watching the film becomes a physically exhausting experience.Thornton's Karl is, apparently, a gentle man with an emotionally intense core. One can never be sure whether his slow, deliberate nature is completely a result of his slower intelligence or his guarded, fractured emotions. The fact that this is so challenging to decide is a tribute to Thornton's balanced, insightful performance.Despite Karl's obvious lackings in intelligence, he gets a job fixing small motors, befriends a boy named Frank, and is eventually invited by Frank's mother, Linda (Natalie Canerday), to live in the family's garage. Conflict erupts from her jealous, redneck boyfriend Doyle (Dwight Yoakam) and, well, the rest simply must be seen.\"Sling Blade\" captured the Best First Feature prize for Thornton from the Independent Spirit Awards, along with a screenplay award at the Oscars. While Thornton's performance was Oscar-nominated, somehow the Academy thought there was a better performance in 1996 from a Male Actor. They were wrong.Likewise, the lack of a nomination for the powerful, focussed performance of country singer Dwight Yoakam is almost impossible to fathom. Yoakam sizzles here in portraying a boyfriend who can, at the flip of a cowboy hat, be tender and paternal then abusive and jealous. It's a tremendous performance.\"Sling Blade\" is, without a doubt, one of the best independent films ever made with a near perfect combination of strong script, focused direction, solid performances down to the smallest role, and beautiful cinematography. Sadly, it suffered the fate of last year's \"The Woodsman,\" a stellar film limited by its intimidating, well presented subject matter and with performances so strong the film is \"too much\" for your general filmgoing audience.\"Sling Blade\" is one of those \"must see\" films for true connoisseurs of film. It is not a film that every connoisseur will absolutely adore, but it is a film that simply begs to be seen by those who respect the craft of filmmaking. \"Sling Blade\" is exhausting yet exhilarating, troubling yet insightful, and powerful yet numbing. \"Sling Blade\" is a film you may not embrace, but I guarantee you will not forget.",

Everything turned out sooooooooo nicely for that poor guy Karl, people forgave him his murdering, he got a job, everyone was sooooooooo friendly and accepted him. The homosexual guy trusts him so quickly and tells Karl how he can't do an outing. He and the poooooooooor kiddo get best friends. Problem is, this continues almost two hours. It was like a terrible happy ending all over the movie. Next problem, i didn't wonder about the ending at all, when he kills that bad bad bad boyfriend. In fact i was hoping all movie long that he would do that. So maybe this this whole happy story was about to let us not think, that Karl would murder again. But this attempt completely failed. Well i was once working with retarded children and i loved that job, so i don't think that Billy Bob Thornton's acting was very good. If you want to see a brilliant performance, then watch Rainman with Dustin Hoffman. Also Forrest Gump does so much better regarding acting of the main character. But Thornton's acting was surely the best of this movie. The other actors in Sling Blade were pretty much worse. Totally plain and stereotype characters. The homosexual that doesn't like violence at all. The Mother, that can't get away from her bad boyfriend. The other retarded girl. I really didn't like any character at all.

Most of all, however, there exists a love for life and a hope of understanding one another. This is a life altering film.",

The resolution of the movie contradicted the heart of the whole morality tale that I thought the movie was about, and though I respect such a painful twist, I also find it disturbing to think that my fellow watchers found it a satisfying ending with a clear conscience.

Billy Bob Thornton deserved his Oscar for his screenplay. He should have also won the Oscar for Best Actor, too. His performance is one of the greatest that I have ever seen. Lucas Black, Dwight Yoakam, John Ritter, and Robert Duvall bring so much to their characters. You feel like you know them. Thorton directed it masterfully. His choice in music heightens the mood, and also contrasts it in some way, which makes it work perfectly. This film shall forever stand the test of time.",

He took a challenging dramatic role and he nails it in the coffin. I must admit, I wasn't expecting him to be this superb, I guess I underestimated the guy. Billy Bob just came out of nowhere with his explosive performance as reformed criminal/mentally challenged Karl Childers. One can only wonder how he ended up in tasteless movies and tedious comedies. Not only did he act but he also directed and wrote the film. Nothing more can be said other than, he really was passionate about this project and it shows when you see the movie. Great script, great cast and great performances all around.This is Billy Bob's shining moment and is undoubtedly the highest point of his career and credits is where credits due but you just can't help but also notice the support cast which includes Dwight Yoakam as the fiend of a step dad to a very young Lucas Black's character Frank. Black and Billy Bob glued perfectly on screen and you'll just love hating Yoakam's menacing performance.

We see the incongruity of trailer trash hick types that will call Karl a re-tard when they themselves have not a tenth the strength of character and goodness of heart of Karl. He does not understand the world of police, laws and the justice system but he has read the bible and recons he understands a great deal of it. He recognizes a kindred good heart in 'that boy' and his mother.\n  Karl knows the evil side of people perhaps better than we do, being raised as he was and having been made sport of quite a bit. (probably a vast understatement by him) When he is faced with a choice of what to do when people he has come to love are in danger, what would a person like Karl do, think of himself? I am in awe of Thorntons characterisation in Karl. Billy Bob is unrecognizable and the character is striking and unique. While John Wayne was an acclaimed actor, it mattered not what role he was playing be it Rooster Cogburn or Gengis Khan he was always John Wayne, same same. Billy Bob as Karl Childers is acting defined. No actor is to be seen and there is this remarkable fellow name-a Karl Childers in his place. Outstanding tale and deserving nothing less than 10.",

I'd heard about it until I was sick of hearing the title and it had been reccommended to me by several people. Finally, I broke down and decided to watch it. I popped it in the VCR and really wasn't expecting much.  I didn't really care to see a story about some mentally retarded, backwoods hick who had been in lock-up most of his life for butchering his mother.  It just didn't sound too enchanting.  (give me a break, I was 17)Anyway, by the time Carl was halfway into giving his monologue to a wide-eyed reporter, I was too absorbed to go to the bathroom.  For the next two hours, I was on an emotional rollercoaster that no other film has ever even come close to matching.  This one just hit all the right buttons.  I was laughing and crying at the same time and when the whole thing was said and done, I just wanted to find a way to call up Billy Bob Thornton and thank him.  He made a movie that not only changed the way I felt about movies, but also, it changed a lot of the ways that I looked at life.  In short, I haven't been the same since.This is the only movie (with the exception of Fight Club) that I have ever watched all the way through, rewound it, and watched it again the same night. I just couldn't get enough of it.  Yeah, the movie had a long running time, but it just covers SO much.  It covers issues such as abortion, homosexuality, poverty, backwoods life, ignorance, fear, FRIENDSHIP, being gay in and trying to hide it in a small town, and above all, doing what you think is right and putting your own neck on the line for someone you really care about.  This film has covers everything under the sun and does it right.Over the last four years, I have shown this movie to everyone I know and I even watched it with my grandmother.  It really does have something for everyone.  Throughout it's somewhat dark tone, there is a very positive message and after seeing this, you'll never look at a mentally challenged person the same way again.  I promise you that.  Just see it.",

It is a shame he left us so soon.Other excellent performances elevate Slingblade to movie immortality. People still imitate Billy Bob Thornton's portrayal of Karl Childers to this day. Dwight Yoakam is very convincing as the mean redneck and Natalie Canerday is equally convincing as the lonely single mother. Lucas Black puts in a fine performance as he did later in Deepwater.The story is a sad tale about a released mental patient and the people he meets after he is released. Childers is our blank slate, the observer of these people's lives. He makes friends and eventually takes action in that he believes is necessary to save his friends.Highly recommended for the superb acting and unique and interesting story.",

During the several years of his rehabilitation, he achieves remarkable proficiency in small engine repair, learns to read, and fine tunes an original proclivity for righteous indignation by his dedication to independent bible study. After a favorable prognosis from hospital administration, he is released back into the rural community from whence he came. There, he discovers French Fries, lands a job \"fixin\" small engines, and is befriended by a few compassionate locals who allow him to reside in their garages. But such paradisaical circumstances as these are rarely lasting. It seems our hero is unable to control his religious impulses, and eventually splits a mans head in half with the blade of a lawn mower. As a consequence, he is sent back to the \"nervous hospital.\" On the positive side, the towns small engines have never ran better.Overall message of movie: one is always justified to kill other people with various lawn implements if one has strong morals, which, coincidently, is the \"fundamental\" message of most religions (one can, for example, easily imagine a Muslim version of this movie). Editorial: mildly entertaining bit of acting by Thornton, Ritter, and surprisingly, Yokum. The kid who plays \"Frank,\" however, maintains the cathartic effect by periodic appeal to the viewers (juvenile) sympathies (assisted, in large part, by tear-jerking background music).",

            "content": "***This review DOES contain spoilers***Sling Blade was a unique movie. I have never seen another movie exactly like this. This movie was written by and directed by Billy Bob Thornton. The movie starts off with a young student reporter trying to get the scoop on a man that murdered his own mother and her lover. As a result, he ended up in a psychiatric ward that he called the \"nervous hospital\". After 20 years he is released. The theme of this movie is very religious. There are many references to the Bible and God. Karl spent four years reading the bible. His parents claimed to be very religious (even though his mother was having an affair and his father was an alcoholic) and believed that he was a punishment from God. The theme could also be looked at as people deserve a second chance. I have watched this movie two times. The first time that I watched it I would have given it rave reviews. However, the second time I watched it, I paid closer attention to the plot without getting involved in the emotional portion of this movie. Ultimately, I find that there are major inconsistencies. While Billy Bob Thornton plays the part of Karl Childers wonderfully, the character himself is inconsistent. Karl is way more competent than a person of his demeanor should be at some parts and more incompetent in other parts. Case in point, is that doesn't seem to understand that basic concepts such as freedom but then he understands more complex concepts such as how lawn mower engines work and that his parents didn't do a good job raising him. He even talks about how they had him take his brother out to the trash but then he kept him in a shoebox until he died. Later, when confronting his father about it, he was able to articulate words about him not killing his brother and saying, \"I learned to read some. I read the Bible quite a bit. I can't understand all of it, but I reckon I understand a good deal of it. Them stories you and Momma told me, they ain't in there\"....\"You outta not killed my little brother. He ought to have had a chance to growed up. He would have had fun sometimes.\" (Thornton, 1996) But here you can see that he understands the meaning of death and what would have happened if his brother hadn't died. Also, paying close attention to the words, he uses proper English, then slang, then improper wording in his sentence. It is very inconsistent. The lighting in the film is fairly dark and there are not many close up shots. I don't feel like there were indirect-subjective points of views. Mainly the film is back and forth between objective and subjective points of the views throughout the movie. The costumes in the film were more of old dingy clothes that you would associate with poor folks. This movie slightly reminds me of Forrest Gump. Tom Hanks played a mentally challenged and religious character in that film and you get the same sentiment, in a shorter film here without all of the luck. Overall, it is a film that I would recommend seeing but not one that I would rave about. When I watched it as I normally would have, without critiquing it, I liked it. But when I watched it again while critiquing it, I just found far too many inconsistencies to highly recommend it. I am giving it a 4/10.",

I had never heard of this movie until someone posted it on their Top Ten list, and since it was written, directed and starring Billy Bob Thornton I reckoned, \"Why not check it out?\". Turns out this incredibly underrated little movie is a true gem.I'd admired Thornton's work in many movies, but the first movie where his acting chops caught my attention was \"The Man Who Wasn't There\". That and Angelina Jolie.Well, who would have guessed. He really shines here as Karl Childers, a mentally-handicapped man (we never know exactly what he has) who is 'let loose' from a mental institution years after committing a crime. I think this is one of the best performances I have ever seen. Turns out he was nominated for his role here in the 1997 Academy Awards, but lost to Geoffrey Rush. In my opinion Thornton's performance was better. That's how good it is.What makes this film captivating is that Karl is a very awkward figure and he naturally makes most people feel awkward, but he is human, and the movie is all about that, really. His talents as a handy man, as well as his completely rational (albeit limited and scarce) conversational skills, seem to indicate he's a savant of some sort. His re-integration into the world, his interactions with 'real people', his mannerisms, his past, his morals, his intelligence and his emotions are all depicted here with a degree of realism and drama that is difficult to see in movies.This is a slow-paced movie, but the script makes it seem irrelevant. You'll find yourself repeating Karl's unique words, expressions and grunts (at least in your head) days after you watch this. Kinda like the kids that imitate Borat. And yes, it's a lot fun, uh hum.By the way, I wasn't surprised to later learn that Billy Bob won the Oscar that same year for Best Adapted Screenplay and I can only rejoice that for once, a movie this good (and not mainstream) was recognized.There are a few key characters and they all serve their purpose, as the people Karl comes across are outcasts in their own ways. But this is really about Billy Bob's creation. I find it amazing that he directed this movie himself, see it and you'll understand why. Thornton is a very talented man, I can only hope he goes back to making such good stuff like this instead of throwaway movies.What else can I say? Go watch this. And you ain't talking nothing nasty 'bout this film, you hear me? Just kidding. I give it a 9 out of 10.",

I think that Billy Bob's portrayal of Karl grounds the rest of the film, because once you buy the character, the rest of the film can be accepted. And what a film it is! The other truly standout performance is by the late John Ritter, as the small-town middle aged gay store manager. Ritter does a magnificent job with the role, being at once sweet and unintentionally funny at the same time. I'm not sure how Ritter came to accept this role - perhaps to make up for some of the big bucks he made with the stupid family films he made in 1990's - but his onscreen presence is wonderful. Kudos too go out to Dwight Yoakum, as a truly evil boyfriend who turns violent maniac at the drop of a hat.A must-see film, one of the best of the 90's.",

Thornton loses himself in Carl to the point that it's difficult to remember that this is an actor playing the part. In my life I've come across people like Doyle Hargraves, the boyfriend played alarmingly on-target by Dwight Yoakam. This character is hard to watch, but if Thornton and Yoakam hadn't made Hargraves as real and despicable as they did, the movie would not have been as good as it is. Lucas Black as Frank Wheatley and Natalie Canerday as Frank's mother Linda Wheatley are also perfectly cast. They present a credible picture of a struggling mother and her son. The setting is almost without hope, from the clothing and houses to the jobs and landscape. There is a foreboding that something bad will happen, yet there is an undercurrent throughout the movie that all will be saved. (Note the scene in the bedroom with Carl and the hammer, then the baptism scene that follows it.) Music is used sparingly, but when it is, it enforces the underlying angst of the scene. The movie is a perfect 10, gently, yet forcefully, telling a story of compassion, love and hope.",

Thornton also stars as Carl Childers, a mental patient whose time is up, who is released into the world. Once on the outside he adjusts to his old home which has changed. He forms a wonderful friendship with a boy named Frank. The friendship is unusual but quite touching and as the film goes on he develops to be a kind of fatherly figure to the boy, but yet they cannot be that close as Frank's mother has a boyfriend named Doyle who is a cold authoritarian who is often violent and abusive towards just about everyone, especially Frank. It is a beautifully slow movie and the directing is amazing, as it seems to sweep along majestically. The story is simplistic, yet powerful, and there are often some extremely sad moments as Carl tells Frank of his horrible childhood. The \"Sling Blade\" concepts is exceptionally dark and told to a reporter early on in the film, who is trying to write an article about him, as of this point no one knows whether it is safe to let him out of prison, as he was in there for murder. \"Will you kill again?\" The reporter asks, and Carl replies, \"I don't reckon I got no reason to kill no one no more.\" Still you don't know. And that is what makes the climax so good, as Doyle gets his grisly comeuppance. It is fantastic how this slow film is so captivating. It is brilliant honestly, if you watch it with an open mind, and accept the story for what it is, you will admit that this beautiful tale with its gritty drama, and wonderful dialogue is one of the best films of the 90s, and definitely Billy Bob's crowning achievement.",

Not only were his actions lacking in reason, they were also mostly predictable.  I couldn't understand him.  I did identify with the basically decent people who followed the rules and dismissed him from the mental hospital, and I want to scream at them, \"Don't do it!\" Billy Bob has a climactic scene with Dwight Yoakam that I saw coming from the beginning of the film.  Why does this scene take place?  Because Dwight's a jerk.  Is \"Sling Blade\" suggesting that this is how we should deal with jerks?  Was I the only person who was angry at the girlfriend for not kicking Yoakam out of the house?  I've suggested that this film is a tragedy.  It isn't, really.  It's just a tale in which the folks in charge of a mental hospital do something stupid, leading to a series of predictable, sad events.  \"Sling Blade\" did not entertain me.  It made me ill.",

Billy Bob Thornton has a way of capturing true southern speech patterns and dialect, which is no surprise because it's what he heard all his life. No cotton-pickin'-honey-chile phoniness in his dialogue, and I appreciate that. I always smile when Karl says, \"Coffee makes me kindly nervous.\" Karl Childers is put into an institution for the criminally insane for the simple reason that he tried to protect his mother from what he thought was a bad man, and protect her the only way he knew how. It's a sad commentary that he gets punished for essentially nothing more than a misplaced sense of chivalry.This chivalrous aspect is obviously part of his basic make-up, but in 20 years of rehabilitation -- \"They say I'm well.\" -- he is never taught how to channel it correctly and in the end he once again gets punished for doing what he feels he must do to protect someone else; he does the wrong thing for the right reason.My favorite scene is the one where Karl tries to re-tell the off-color joke that his boss told at lunch. Karl tells it the best way he can recall, in order to break the awkward silence in the kitchen after the long night of Doyle's drunkeness and abuse. Linda's comment of \"I'll be dogged\" is perfect.The only problem I have with this film -- and it's a minor one -- is the scene where Karl is playing football with the boys. Here is a man who spent most of his boyhood locked in a shed and has been kept away from society for the last 20 years; I don't think he would know how to play the game, even given that football is a religion in the south.All right then.",

So it would be tough for his performance to reach my expectations, but to be honest he passed them.  Thornton's performance is quite simply amazing. I have no idea why he didn't win the Oscar which he was nominated for. Thornton plays a retarded man who after spending 30 years in a mental hospital for the murder of his mom and her lover with a sling blade is released and set on his own.  He returns to his hometown where he befriends a young boy, played by an exceptional Lucas Black, and his mother.  She is dating a drunk, abusive man (surprisingly well played by country singer Dwight Yoakam).  The main story is about the friendship between Thornton and Black.  The other part of the story is about how Thornton deals with someone like Yoakam.  John Ritter (Problem Child, Bride of Chucky) who I never thought of as much of an actor, is excellent as a gay friend of Black, Thornton, and Black's mother.  Ritter's character really cares for them and doesn't want them to be hurt by Yoakam.  The late J.T. Walsh (Breakdown, A Few Good Men) and Robert Duvall (Deep Impact, The Apostle) both give great cameo/bit part performances.  The film is powerful at times, but also a bit too long and boring at points, but I recommend it on the strength of Thornton's performance alone.",

He is, however, disabled, and is forced to rely on the good will of strangers to survive, which sets him on a path of compassion and contempt at the hands and hearts of others.While the story is uniquely touching, and while the characters seem genuine and human, what this story really lacks is impact. There are a few moments of heightened impact, but, generally, the story falls to heavily on its characters' shoulders and never crosses the threshold of being particularly moving.Ultimately, it is an extremely well-made film, with an impressive story to boot, but it never delivers the gut punches it should have.

At one point, when his adoptive family gets into a fight with an abusive boyfriend, he just sits on the couch and doesn't move a muscle. How many actors can just sit there and not be distracted like that? I had heard good things about this movie, but I was not entirely aware of how great Thornton's performance was. Now that I've seen it, I'm floored. Just to cover all bases here, I was also impressed by the long shots, the great work by the supporting cast, and the strength of the screenplay. \"Sling Blade\" is an excellent character study of how a good-hearted but unfortunately unstable man tries to live in the \"big world.\" And then you have Billy Bob Thornton at the center of it all.Anyone who's interested in terrific performances or quietly effective storytelling should see this movie now.

            "content": "Movies can say a lot about the wrongs of a certain epoch and big box office movies have sometimes triggered social change. For instance, \"One flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" led to improved patent care in American psychiatric facilities and \"Midnight Express\" led to a new and improved prisoner exchange program between the United States and Turkey. In Sling Blade we witness a mentally challenged man, who had been institutionalized for about 20 years, given just a few dollars and expected to fend for himself in the outside world. It was hardly surprising that Karl Childers came straight back the next day and asked to be readmitted. I sure hope that a discharged inmate of a State Mental Hospital would receive better community support today. This got me thinking about what year Mr. Thornton had in mind when he wrote the script for this movie. According to Wikipedia, the depicted events took place \"in the mid-1990s\" (i.e. Contemporary with the actual shooting of this movie). I beg to differ. Notice the complete absence of any desk-top computers in the administrative offices at the state hospital and the fact that nobody uses a cell phone at any point in this movie. I looked for other clues. The traffic on the road wasn't much help because a lot of people tend to drive older cars in rural areas. One clue was the scene at the \"Frosty Cream\" - a thinly disguised \"Dairy Queen\" - counterman \"Deke\" (Jim Jarmusch) quotes 60 cents for a regular size order of French fries and 75 cents for a large portion. According to the 2021 \"Dairy Queen\" online menu, a large takeout serving of fries in Arkansas today will cost you approximately $2.70. Using the United States Consumer Price Index for fast-food, I have estimated that a large order of fries could have been purchased for seventy-five cents back in 1978. Does that sound right? Could cans of potted meat \"on special\" at a convenience store in 1978 have been purchased for only a dollar a can?",

Excellent music.Some of the lines had me laughing out loud, ************SPOILER*****************and in the end, Karl's speech on the porch to John Ritter's character almost had me in tears.\"That boy lives inside his own heart...that's an awful big place to live.\"a truly memorable film that I cannot recommend highly enough",

            "content": "When I first watched \"Sling Blade\" nearly ten years ago, I knew nothing about it. I assumed it was part of the Wesley Snipes vampire series. I was completely unprepared for what became my #1 favourite movie of all-time.Simply put, \"Sling Blade\" is the story of mentally-impaired Karl who gets released from \"the nervous hospital\" after 30 years, having committed a double murder as a young boy. He is taken in by an extremely trusting woman Linda and her young son Frank, who Karl befriends. This all takes place in what is surely one of the hillbilliest reddest-neck towns in Arkansas.To describe the story as big-hearted doesn't suffice, this story is ALL heart. In addition to the warm engaging characters of Karl, Linda and Frank, there's Linda's friend Vaughn, a closeted smalltown gay guy, and even the minor characters like doctors and mechanics are drawn as compassionate caring characters. This movie can remind you of all the good things human beings are capable of, even in dark circumstances.It's far from easy-viewing. Linda's abusive boyfriend Doyle is violent, manipulative, and threatens to destroy the lives of Linda and Frank. Doyle is so hateful that it's almost reluctant that I say Dwight Yoakam probably gives the second best performance. He makes your skin crawl, without ever being over the top, it's totally realistic. There are moments that are hard to watch (nothing graphic) and yet you can't turn your eyes away.To me, this film has everything - drama, comedy, horror, love, thrills, emotion - and yet it is surprisingly simple. I have gone back and watched this movie over and over and I never tire of it. Even after a decade, it remains my #1 film of all time, and I wished more people watched it.",

Karl had every right to split his head open with a lawn mower blade.It's too bad we didn't get to see the results. Lucas Black played his part flawlessly. Being from Alabama he had the perfect accent for the part. I also enjoyed Natalie Canerday. She's always a pleasure to watch. She's so down home, and has such a beautiful personality.Even Jack Ritter had a role that suited him well. altho I'm straight,I always, for some reason feel sorry for gay folks, and I felt very sorry for his particular character,I think because of the way Yoakam treated him. The story consisted of a paroled mental patient who made friends with with Frank (Lucas Black), and moved in with the family, which consisted of Franks mom, and most of the time Doyle Hargrove, who hated Frank, and was abusive to Franks mom, which in the end led to his demise. I hope I haven't revealed so much that you decide not to see it. Believe me it is well worth watching, if for nothing more than Billy Bobs unbelievably acting,",

These types of individuals are warts on the ass of humanity, sucking life force from every available source.  To classify the parents as \"demons\" would be an insult to actual demons.Furthermore, Dwight Yoakum has done an excellent job of illustrating some of the actual character defects of alcoholics.Paradoxically, the main character finds more sanity in an asylum/sanitarium than he encounters in the \"outside\" world.The movie accurately illustrates that people are predominantly products of their original environments until and unless they begin to think on their own, have vision, and question everything that we as a society consider \"normal\".The movie is classified as \"fiction with a purpose\" - it teaches and instructs, if we will pay attention.",

It set the foundation for numerous ideas that would have made good stories but does not build on any of them. Instead of making these issues important to the story they just seem to happen on the side, leaving the audience with a plot-less slow-moving film. Any important events that happen in the film end up meaningless to the overall movie by the conclusion. The sad thing is, the small ideas that I mentioned all would have made good movies by themselves: The relationship between Karl and the boy; The cruel new world Karl is introduced to; the family's problems with the mother's boyfriend and his drinking; and even the relationship of Karl with another \"slow\" person whom he goes for a walk with. This latter idea is a prime example of how the director shows us the idea and then throws it away. They go out for a walk; the next day the girl brings him flowers, and then she is never heard from again the entire movie.

In addtion hat, the director put great effort on producing the environment that story portrays.I think it's the 50's in some calm southern town. However it was a kind of surprise to me to see the contrast between people's lives and the town's calmness. The movie, of course, has got references to small-town small-people figure, but people are so conforming as accepting Karl into their lives for a little town if you ask me.For a critical eye, movie comes and goes to limits of being banal and clich\u00e9 time to time, but just stays at the right side every time.Thornton's play is extraordinary. I rather felt like they found a guy with some mental problems and somehow made him to take a role in this movie. He was that much perfect, I believe. Lucas Black is good too for his age, he looks very strong against all the bad in his life.Sometimes the story fells like a Stephen King novel where someone is eighter all good or all, bad but showing people with different backgrounds movie recovers itself from this catch quite well.At the end I thought (like everyone else) God's got an agenda beyond our knowledge and he's got so many ways of doing it... uh uh",

The putrid tripe that the Hollywood \"machine\" had been churning out for the past decade had me holding my nose and stomach.  My roommate came home one day with a rental and said simply \"you've got to watch this.\"  With a sinking feeling I agreed.  With arms crossed protectively over my body I witnessed a miracle.  This couldn't be true could it?  No one in or around Hollywood could've produced a movie of this quality.  No way.  And no one \"Hollywood\" did. \nThe fact that this movie even exists is a miracle.  I could just imagine the response producers must've had to the screenplay - there's not even one exploding body part, car chase, demented love triangle or explicit sexual scene.  This film doesn't need any of those things.  It stands alone on the merits of the story it tells.  The story is at once completely original and somehow strangely familiar. Mr. Thornton's writing abilities really shine through in this film.  The characters who people this story are so real.  So sadly, poignantly and dimensionally real that it plays like a documentary of the life of a de-institutionalized mental patient rather than a fictional movie.   And yet there are moments of art that go way beyond documentary.  This is where Mr. Thornton's acting abilities stand out.  Not only Mr. Thornton's, but every person who spoke a line in this film.  The best word I can possibly use to describe this film is perfection.  If by some odd chance you've not seen it yet, you owe it to yourself to do so.  Quickly.  Repeatedly.  You won't regret it.

The first 20 minute showed promise but the whole thing just ran out of steam. I like to read User Reviews, often other viewers point out things that are interesting. I'm honestly surprised by all the 8/10 - 10/10 with only a small fraction of lower scores. So many viewers waxed prophetically about the \"brilliant performances\" of the various actors such as Dwight Yoakam's. I don't see it.

On top of this fact Billy Bob Thornton is one of my most favored actors, one of those select few who I have never seen play a role I did not like even if I did not care for the film itself.This all being known I could not pass up the open opportunity to see the film on HBO OD, as it would cost me nothing but two hours of my time even if I was not all too fond of the movie.The acting is the up-point of the film, being exceptional even by the standards of Thornton and never really lacking. However, this is all based upon Hollywood perspective, as I am yet to see even a single film where anyone acts like a real person to even a mild degree. For these standards, the film's performances are exceptional.You really buy into it being a small southern town, as well as the leading character Karl having a long ago history there. Many characters know of him or at least his actions that got him placed into the institution all those years ago, but none of them truly know him as he was very young and few of them know it was he personally who committed such acts. The leading character, while being mentally challenged and a bit difficult to understand at times, is quite likable in spite of his past and you really learn to care for him, knowing that not a single action of his life had true malice behind it as much as simple ignorance.The storyline is interesting, be it a tad unoriginal and simplistic, but perhaps this is not a bad thing at all. The flow is quite smooth, if a little slow at times. The pace is fairly enjoyable, though, constructed and progressed well. It is a fine example of character study, however the supporting characters are a bit shallow and forgotten under the heavy focus of Karl himself.The antagonist is quite convincing and well acted, but the problem there is the lack of a true depth to him. You see several negative acts committed by him, but none that truly warrant him as a bad person but much closer to simply an every day aggressive drunk. He is nothing special or interesting, and while this is the point to his character the movie does not tell you enough about him on an emotional and mental level to really learn to dislike him fairly, it nearly feels forced.Overall, the film is quite good and definitely worth the time you will spend on it. It is a little flat and slow at times, as well as quite predictable, but it has heart and talent behind it. Billy Bob is at his best, and if you are a fan of his you should not miss this film. However, sadly that seems to be the strongest audience that will positively receive it. While the average movie-goer is certain to approve, I somewhat doubt that anyone who dislikes Billy Bob specifically will find anything redeeming enough to make the film stand out.I give this film a seven out of ten, for being well acted and designed, but falling a bit flat in substance and originality.",

These are all just plain folk, living plain lives in a plain little town. This, like Night of the Living Dead, is one of those movies in which the people interact just like you and me. No Hollywood dialogue or over the top flash; just people being people.Underneath the shroud of abuse, mental illness, homicide, incarceration, retardation, homophobia, et al, there is, at the film's core, a simple love story between a man and a boy who are victims of an unfortunate series of events. The depth and sweetness of their friendship had me in tears more than once, and even after screening Sling Blade a few dozen times, I still cry.The soundtrack by Daniel Lanois is so spiritual without being sappy religious.The whole presentation is simply phenomenal.",

VERY, if there's a heart in you. One viewer said the friendship between the boy and Karl was unbelievable... I disagree. Karl was never given a childhood of his own, and the boy didn't really have an adult male to look up to.  Why is that so hard for some of you to understand?I guess this is just a movie you have to let yourself become a part of***SPOILERS AHEAD***.... if you were locked in a shack and forced to bury your not yet dead sibling, I think there would be some ill effects to your mental state.  BBT does a phenominal, FANTASTIC job with the character of Karl.  Seeing BBT in other movies like Pushing Tin, it's hard to believe he's the same man. You know he's done wrong, and you can see that he's about to do wrong again... yet you feel for him.  The motive behind his action is one of love. Violence is never the answer, and in a perfect world there would be no violence nor need for it, but Karl's life isn't perfect... so far from it, in fact, that it is easy to see why he is the way he is.The movie is slow moving, but I think to rush it along would kill off the charm it holds.I recommend this movie to every one.

Billy Bob Thornton wrote and directed, and acted. He had a fixed, goofy expression, and said gruff sweet things in a highly southern dialect with odd grunts and non-verbal noises. I never did decide whether it was absurdly stylized, or a faithful impression of somebody he had known.Our hero had been raised in a dark shed and then had killed a mean boy when he found the boy screwing his mother. But then his mother tore into him and he killed her too. Then he spent 25 years in a nut house, but was now getting released. Everybody thought he was 'retarded'. So predictable! I knew right away he was going to kill again and promptly identified the target.To be fair, it raises some questions. The victim was the mean boyfriend of the mother of the nice boy that befriended our hero. The boy kept saying he wanted to kill the boyfriend or see him dead. The gay friend (John Ritter, doing a great job) of the woman pretty much knew what our hero planned when our hero asked for him to keep the woman overnight. But the friend didn't resist at all. And the boyfriend, while highly obnoxious, never did more than a push, and that in retaliation. The system, which had institutionalized our hero, let him out, but didn't follow up effectively.Perhaps the point was to demonstrate that for most of us, including me as it turns out, we prefer a nice killer to a dickish victim. The killing felt OK, almost brave, that he knowingly sacrificed his freedom.It had 5 stars on Netflix. And yes, it had tons of style. But so predictable! And slow! Seemed like hours!

It stars Billy Bob Thornton-- in the role of a lifetime-- as Karl a mentally challenged man who has a violent past.  He gets out of a institution and meets a young boy named Frank who is raised by a single mother with a cruel boyfriend-- magnificently played by country crooner, Dwight Yoakam.  Frank and Karl become fast friends and Frank invites him to stay with him and his mom.  But, mean Doyle played by Yoakam insists on making their lives miserable.  He is very mean to Frank and his mother so Karl kills Doyle out of love for Frank.  This is a must see film that will sadden you as well as make you laugh. **** stars",

            "content": "This film by virtue of its independence has shied away from the usual hype associated with American movies. The result is an original screenplay by Billy Bob Thornton that is transformed into a mesmerising tale of the American South. 'Sling Blade' challenges us to re-evaluate our principles and our definitions of right, wrong and of justice. Billy Bob Thornton plays a slightly retarded psychiatric patient by the name of Karl Childers, who has been in an asylum for the criminally insane for 25 years. As his name suggests, Karl Childers is a child-like man with instilled Southern Christian values and somewhat comical mannerisms, including his nervous grunts. His jutting lower lip, raspy voice and short back and sides haircut have similarities with the protagonist in the movie Forest Gump, but that is where the similarities end. Despite Karl's horrific background, a sense of right and wrong and of justice still remain. Billy Bob Thornton doesn't so much act but more so becomes Karl Childers.Dwight Yoakam plays Linda's boyfriend, Doyle Hargraves, a belligerent, alcoholic, construction worker who abuses just about everyone he comes into contact with. Doyle has contempt for anyone who is not like him, which is just about everyone. His abusive nature, especially toward the young boy and the mother incites the viewer to dispute and question their own morals.The cinematography is dominated by opaque and earthy colours both inside and outdoors. In the houses, the brown furnishings, brown wallpaper, and drawn brown blinds give the sensation of watching an old brown and white film. This is an intentional plan to portray to the viewer that they are in the midst of an old-fashioned society with out dated views and attitudes. 'Sling Blade' is an intense drama that takes its time in telling the story and revealing the characters. This film is not to be seen for its entertainment value but to be appreciated for what it is, a brilliantly constructed and original tale of human tragedy. 'Sling Blade' shows us that heroes are sometimes the most unlikely people.",

Like many movies I enjoy, this also has deliberate pacing, which only adds to the understated quality. Many filmmakers feel the need to rig up a bunch of explosions right after a scene of mostly dialogue, and that is because mostly idiots go to the movies and the filmmakers cater to them to keep their bums in the seats. If you have never seen this movie, please watch it and do American society a favor, because after watching this movie you will learn to loathe John-Woo-drivel-action-movies, and maybe if enough people STOP giving money in exchange for \"junk\" they would quit shoveling it at us.

However if you are a fan of only Die Hard, Top Gun and Adam Sandler type films - STAY AWAY.

            "content": "Rarely does a film reach the level of perfection achieved by the great films ever made. The Godfather. Slumdog Millionaire. The Fugitive. The Shawshank Redemption. Field Of Dreams. Just to name a few. Sling Blade is one such film. In a career-best, mind-boggling effort, Billy Bob Thornton shines as the star, writer, and director of this amazing film. He plays a curious character named Karl Childers, who's just been released from a mental hospital in the deep south. Karl did something very, very bad many, many years ago, but decades of being institutionalized has weathered him some. He's been set up with a part-time job and a place to stay. At first, we're wondering if Karl can handle all of this. But when he excels at his job and befriends a young boy, Thornton begins a process in which he expounds upon the character of Karl Childers so skillfully, so tenderly, when we know it's Thornton at the helm of the whole thing, you have to be in awe. We grow, rather quickly, to like Karl, and that's the idea. He strikes a chord within us, somewhere deep and primal. And make no mistake, this is anything but an exploitation of the mentally disturbed or anyone else. No, it's a stirring, heartfelt, and heartbreaking portrayal of a man who seemed doomed to redeem himself. The film also benefits from spot-on supporting performances by the likes of Lucas Black, the boy whom Karl befriends, Natalie Canerday as the boy's mother, Dwight Yoakam as her heavy drinking, dim-witted boyfriend, and John Ritter as the mother's best friend. These performances are top-notch all the way around. But what makes it a \"perfect\" movie is the way Thornton allowed himself as writer, director, and star to explore the character. Karl is simple, but multi-layered. Thornton creates a growth within the character that is as sensible as it is spellbinding. It's a two-hour peak into a world few would imagine if they hadn't seen it, with southern lower-middle class people in a dusty town set against a backdrop of often gorgeous, lush bayou-type settings. It creates a feel, emotionally. One scene in particular, where Karl goes home for the first time in decades, only to find his babbling, accusatory father rotting away in his rocking chair (a brilliant cameo performance by Robert Duvall), is performed with such a brilliant display of poignancy that we're left to wonder what the hell happened to Thornton in the years since this film. While I loved him in The Man Who Wasn't There, I hated him in Armageddon, and Bad Santa, and Mr. Woodcock, and just about everything else I've seen him in since. Those movies may have their moments, in the right time or place, but Sling Blade is timeless, and light years ahead of the vast majority of his other films. In fact, we're not even sure what year it takes place, and it doesn't matter. The mother's boyfriend, who doesn't like Karl or the Ritter character because he's gay, becomes increasingly confrontational and controlling. We feel fearful of what might happen. The bittersweet ending pulls no punches and plays no tricks; we practically expect it, but can't help being engrossed by it. Sling Blade is remarkable film everyone above the age of say, 16, should see. It's touching and powerful, and it's movie magic.",

            "review_title": "The Best Film of the 90s!",
            "content": "Usually I don't like the style of filmmaking in which whole scenes or long stretches of dialogue are shot from one angle, especially if it's an extreme wide shot as are most of the shots in Sling Blade. It reminds me of public access TV talk shows or the films of first-year film students and it generally causes the viewer's attention to drift. it has to be done with style, in other words the lighting and theme of the film should match the remote, impersonal feeling of the camera-work. That's exactly what this film does. Just about everything about this film works, and works powerfully. It's a dark film both thematically and literally, and the characters are so real and believable I couldn't stop watching it even during a second and third viewing. The outcome of the film, I think, is supposed to be predictable. Realistic films are often predictable because life is often predictable. The propensity of the mental hospital director (James Hampton) to evaluate Karl (Billy Bob Thornton) based on a the kind of superficial blanket diagnosis he learned in medical school is a typical and dangerous problem with mental health \"professionals\". The treatment of mentally ill people should be taken on a case-by-case basis, taking into account every part of their entire life situation, past and present, but of course that kind of attention, research and care takes a huge amount of time, money and effort for overworked mental health workers. This film shows that not doing that work can result in something much worse than making one's job more difficult, such as people being locked up for no good reason or, as in this case, people being released who are killers. Mental health \"consumers\" are generally more intelligent, diverse, and complex and HUMAN than the people who try to control them think they are, or HAVE to think they in order to control them. As far as the acting, i think the Lucas Black as the boy Frank and Dwight Yoakom as Linda's sadistic boyfriend Doyle are better than Billy Bob Thornton as Karl because Karl's fixed facial expression makes his acting easier, even if keeping that expression was physically painful. The scene where Doyle was trying to act nice to Linda and Frank out of fear of losing Linda was a masterpiece. That's exactly how a sadistic *sshole like that would act and talk in that situation. Even in trying to act nice he'd twist things around to make himself seem more important and indispensable to them. In the garage scenes, you can sense the unspoken boredom and desperation and disappointment with life in Karl's coworkers. I hope the gay character Vaughn (the late John Ritter) wasn't just thrown in because in 1996 it was just starting to be the style in Hollywood to throw in a gay character. It seems like that because the existence of his character doesn't help set up the film's conclusion and everything else in the film does, but he's very funny and believable and his speech is typical of the new gay political correctness. One line by the boy Frank, when speaking about Vaughn, is totally implausible: \"Queers do better in the big town\". A 9-year-old boy, especially one who lives out in the sticks, wouldn't know something like that, but that's nitpicking in a great film like this. It's strange, though, how Linda (Natalie Canerday) doesn't have a single close-up in the entire film. The closest the camera gets to her face is a middle-range-shot in the baptism scene. In the scene where Karl kills Doyle, it was a good decision not to show the blade actually striking the head. Everyone can imagine what a cracked skull looks like. It doesn't make the scene any more powerful to see it, in fact probably less. I think generally it only works to show an ultra-violent act on film if it's a documentary in which you're trying to convince the viewer about the cruelty and sadism of some actual group or person, because in that case the viewer is already swayed by a deeply-engrained false opinion and need to be wrenched out of it by something visceral and visually shocking. The background music in the film seems to add dignity to these unhappy characters while simultaneously making the impending tragedy seem more inevitable. It's not an entirely realistic world this film creates, maybe EVEN more dark and murky than life usually is both visually and thematically, but it's realistic enough to draw you into its darkness.",

It is said that in cinema that is a pure image with little you can say a lot and not use both dialogue and something merely expository, but in this film the dialogues give you goosebumps especially in two sequences that Karl narrates and invites you to Imagine without being shown anything, but still achieves extraordinary power. Billy's masterful performance as well as the supporting actors who accompany very well, the film with a slow pace perhaps as his own character completely immerse us in this story of drama but also of friendship and love.

However, when the short was planned to be expanded to fill two hours, more scenes, or situations rather, were basically just tacked on.  I had never watched a film in fast-forward before, but I couldn't help it....  I reckon I was bored, Mmmm-Hmmm.",

If it weren't for that darned \"English Patient\", \"Sling Blade\", one of the greatest films in the history of man, would have been the killer for 1996. \"The English Patient\" just had to be released the same year, didn't it?! Anyway, \"Sling Blade\" is one of my highest-recommended films EVER, and is also one of my three favorites (the others being 1994's \"Forrest Gump\" and 1993's \"Benny & Joon\"......Yes, I know they don't mix, but they're all great!). Although it was critically praised as an outstanding movie, I still see it as underrated. It truly is one of the best movies ever created, with absolutely outstanding scenes (the scene where Carl goes to talk to his father and then goes outside and finds where his younger brother was buried - \"little feller.......\" - actually brought tears to my eyes!) Critics actually got something right: the immortal \"Sling Blade\" delivers a stunning and spectacular performance that couldn't be repeated. If you haven't seen it already, you don't know how much you're missing.************Absolutely brilliant************",

            "content": "\"Sling Blade\" is a good movie, but I appreciated it mostly for some of the risks it takes.Firstly, Billy Bob Thorton is quite the chameleon actor.  I have now seen him in 5 movies, and he is always original and totally different in each. His role of a mentally challenged brother in \"A Simple Plan\" was every bit as good (and more believeable) as that of Karl in \"Sling Blade\".  His spin as an overweight, psycho mechanic in \"U-Turn\" was haunting.  But the fact that he conceived, directed, and starred in SB is very cool!Some of the impressive parts of Sling Blade include the continuous 1 camera shot -- how long scenes are held from just 1 camera angle with no cuts.  The best example is when Karl is being interviewed near the beginning at the hospital, telling his family history.  Even with a lamp beside him smoking from overheating, Thorton is able to stay in character for a good 5 mintues and is very chilling.  Also, notice the fight scene in the house when Dwight Yokum is yelling & shoving and the kid starts throwing stuff at him -- this is all done in one take, 1 camera angle.The movie features great performances from JT Walsh and the kid and of course BBT.My only gripes: the pacing is too slow, some actors are so bad they need a high school drama class (ie, Bill Cox who is Karl's boss at the shop), and that Thorton's character invites sympathy from the viewer although he is evil at times.",

A mentally-Challenged man get's to live free after murdering someone,goes and befriends a young boy and family,(strangers may I add) and they allow him to live with them. That's crazy! And I know it's a movie and not based on a true story but who Mother would allow their son to befriend and live with a Mentally-Challenge stranger?And another thing that bother me alittle was the predictable dialouge. Like I said I never saw the movie up until two weeks ago,and I was starting to speak what the character's were saying before they spoke! A few times I was just getting bored from predictabilty of the speech in the film... I know these were 'Southerners' but those one word,two word answer's were alittle annoying.Despite my obvious dislikes of the film... I will say everyone deserved some type of recongnition for their performances. Billy Bob Thornton delivered in a performance that he may not be able to top. Dwight Yoakam,was completed 'over the top' I hated him and his character,and thought he desevered what happened to him at the end. Natalie Canerday was excellent as the supporting,loving Mother...and Of course John Ritter. Just seeing him with that haircut made me interested in what he had to say. Everyone says this was one of his great performances but unfortunaly like most work he did after 'Three's Company' he didn't have much to do,or say. But I will say that he is more restrained then what you used to seeing him,and it was enjoying him to see him act differently.Overall,I enjoyed the film...good acting. No great acting but not the perfect scirpt and that's a damn shame because the film could've been even better.~CWM~",

The humorous spots are touching and original and make you laugh out loud; the sad spots are very compelling, and should trouble viewers and make you think. Sadly, I am disturbed to think that there may be very small elements of Doyle in all of us, that we don't acknowledge.

            "content": "I wasn't prepared to be disappointed in this film. I'd heard good things about it and knew that it had been nominated for several Oscars, winning one for best adapted screenplay. I saw Monster's Ball last week and was so impressed with Billy Bob Thornton's performance that I decided to catch up on a film I'd missed.It might be that I saw it too late, ten years after its release, after seeing Thornton in more sophisticated roles. More to the point, after hearing his witty commentary on Monster's Ball. It was difficult to find him believable in the part of Karl.I very much enjoyed the performances of Lucas Black as Frank, the young boy Karl befriends, and of James Hampton as Dr. Jerry Woolridge at the state hospital; also the brief cameo of Robert Duvall. Theirs were the best performances in the film. Natalie Canerday playing the boy's mother, Dwight Yoakum playing her boyfriend, and Rick Dial as Karl's boss, were stilted, as if playing their first roles. The camera angles didn't help, they worked against the story rather than enhancing it. Both problems are most likely the result of Thornton directing his first film.I realized what was going to happen about halfway through the film, and from then on it didn't hold my attention as I waited for the inevitable to happen.I think what surprises me most, considering the Oscar awarded, is that the dialogue and characterizations didn't ring true. Karl would say something in a manner too sophisticated for his character. Not so much the language he used as the thought structure behind the language -- he'd have to be a different person to say what he says.Toward the end of the film, Thornton the screenwriter took shortcuts, having Karl say exactly what the audience needed to hear in order to understand the story, without the screenwriter's usual cloaking in the reality of how the character would actually say it. John Ritter playing a gay store manager wasn't given enough original dialogue to avoid a stereotype. (And his haircut was ridiculous.) At times I saw Billy Bob looking out through Karl's eyes; the most striking example was his conversation with Vaughn about having Linda over to stay the night. Most of Thornton's performance boiled down to his manner of speaking, his choice of clothes and physical stance.In a number of scenes, he was moving more quickly than Karl would, as for example when he's packing up to leave the garage behind the Wheatley house. He lifts his mattress and pulls out a pile of cash, lets the mattress fall and immediately straightens the bedclothes. How, or perhaps why, could someone considered \"slow\" straighten the blankets that quickly? And someone who grew up living in a shed, sleeping in an indentation in the dirt? Karl was moving at Thornton's speed, not his own.",

I finally surfed into it on Bravo one afternoon and stayed to watch.I've been a fan of B.B Thornton since I saw him in Bandits even though I also saw him in Armageddon (ugh).  This is the best performance of his I've seen.  In addition to writing the story, screenplay and directing, Billy Bob Thornton turns in a first rate performance.He has a terrific supporting cast with John Ritter a true surprise as the gay store keeper Vaughan Cunningham and Dwight Yoakam as the incarnation of evil, Doyle Hargraves.  Everyone seems to fit their part and added that touch to take you to a small southern town.Some people in their reviews have said this movie was a mockery and nothing but stereotypes of southerners.  Well perhaps in some ways, but they were willing to have a man live and work among them even when they knew he had been in an asylum for a double murder.  They showed him kindness and offered genuine friendship.  Those stereo types can be my neighbors anytime.The movie has it's own pace and some may find it too slow but many of the scenes strike close to home.  The fight the boy Frank has with Doyle throwing things at him.  I'm not sure where Lucas Black pulled those emotions from, but it was like watching the real thing and I was in the room with them.  There is humor, love, pathos, evil, violence Hmmmm... just like life.A fine film from any angle and one of those independent gems.  I highly recommend Sling Blade.",

The film is centered on Carl Hargraves, A mildly retarded man, played to the hilt by Thorton. After Carl is released from a mental institution he returns to his old home town only to find that he no longer knows anyone, and has nowhere to go, until he meets Frank, a young boy lacking a father figure. The two make friends (right off the bat)and become the companions that each desperatly need. I dont want to spoil the movie, so I won't tell you too much, but believe me, this is one of the best films of the 90's. Dwight Yoakum gives a steller performance as the alcoholic, sadistic boyfriend of Frank's mother, as does John Ritter as her homosexual friend/boss. This movie is one of the few films I can watch over and over again. Don't get me wrong, this is not just a mushy friendship film. It has many elements of suspence, and humor as well. In fact it has become a friday night staple with me and my weekend drinking buddies. I really feel sorry for Billy Bob. I doubt he will ever be able to top this one. MMM HHMM!  rating: 9/10",

Not that i hadnt known that before, but when you see something so idiosyncratic as this, you know that the director's creativity has prevailed. It seemed as if Thorton had felt it all through. A sign of an artist for sure. He has this love for the minimalistic and realistic portrayal of life and characters who have simple intentions but he likes to show the power of interaction, he is really a humanist and the characters are really who intrigue him above all else. He also likes to create an atmosphere of staleness which makes this movie hard to watch for some people. Sometimes this can be over-exaggerated, over-exploited, frames can switch faster, they don't need to last that long, but if aiming for realism, this is more like it.

This film was very well written, and its 1990's film elements make it very enjoyable to watch. Sling Blade is about a special needs man named Karl Childers (played by Billy Bob Thornton) who once released from a mental hospital for murdering his mother and her boyfriend, befriends a young boy named Frank (played by Lucas Black) and his family. The acting done by Thornton was absolutely phenomenal, considering the fact that he had to play the role of a mentally \"insane\" human. One of my favorite aspects of this movie is that although Karl came from a mental institution for murder, he has such a big heart and emotional background. Frank and his mother, Linda (played by Natalie Canerday), live with a cruel alcoholic named Doyle that brings their life a lot of trouble. Karl and Franks relationship is heartwarming, because although they are years apart, they love, care, and protect each other. Linda enjoys Karl's friendship with her son because Frank loves his company, but Doyle doesn't approve because he is \"crazy\" and a \"stupid retard\". Dwight Yoakam (the man that plays Doyle) did a successful job at doing what the director wanted him to do, which I believe is making viewers hate Doyle. This film brought me to tears, and I think in a way that's why I enjoyed it so much. It was so emotional and beautifully written, and the acting never failed to impress me.",

You can almost read Karl's mind when he realizes he has nothing to lose by committing another murder since he has killed before.  John Ritter is great as the gay man whose life is just a bit too dramatic.  We need more Karl's in the world, and mustard and biscuits ain't all that bad neither... all right then.",

Franks life draws Carl in and the innocence of his young life, you wouldn't be able to stand by and just watch either. the relationships that end are special as well. the story about Carl's baby brother sure jerks a few tears.

Some will argue that it is less challenging for an actor to play the role of a character that he created and directed himself. Perhaps, as with Robert Duvall in \"The Apostle,\" this is the Academy's justification for not awarding Thornton the Oscar he deserved. (He did win the Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay, however.) Be that as it may, Thornton's performance is outstanding. Some may liken Karl Childers to Forrest Gump, another simpleton with deeper-than-appears perception. But Thornton's Childers is deeper, more believable, more endearing, and far more interesting than Gump. He is a person you won't easily forget. A strong supporting performance by John Ritter and a haunting, original sountrack are splendid additions to this gem. As for all of you who have trashed this film, I believe you have grown so accustomed to standard Hollywood slop, that you are hard-pressed to recognize an original work of genius.

Karl appears to be the most wise and true of all the characters, a cleverer Gump, who will be shown to be the knight in shining armour despite his affliction. Yet in the end he is proved to be still a psychopath who should be locked up and has made little moral progress since committing murders as a boy.Karl kills the 'abusive' boyfriend, but the boyfriend is no way painted so evil as to deserve death. The boyfriend is a bully but he is mainly cowardly and perhaps even seeking to be decent.After balling out the boy in their final scene he ends up saying that he wants the boy to regard him as his father and for them to be regular family.He seems genuinely to love the mother. He never strikes the child and yet he apologises for doing so.Before going on to kill him Karl tells the boy etc that the boyfriend is drunk and dangerous but we see no evidence.Further evidence of Karl genuinely being dangerous is provided earlier when Karl tells his father that he had 'studied' killing him. In the light of what follows we clearly see that the father has narrowly escaped murder. (But to show the contradictions of Karl's character, Karl's first offer to the father is to come by and mow the lawn every so often). In the end whilst Karl's killing of the boyfriend may be thought to improve the boy's life, we are left appalled by the violence inflicted on an unarmed, unsuspecting individual. Karl looks content in the final shot but there is a question as to whether this is because he feels he has saved the boy from the abusive boyfriend or that he is simply happy to have engineered a way to get back inside the mental home.",

I mean, they were all okay, but none were superb.The problem both with the writing and portrayal of the title character, Karl Childers, is that we did not get a real feel for what motivated the character. We are given his history but no sense of the conflicts which must have driven him, his choices, his decisions, and his actions.Maybe it was Thornton being subtle. However, after thinking about the movie for hours after watching it, I have come to some conclusions about the character. First, and most importantly, Childers was not intellectually retarded. In fact, he was quite intelligent. He showed a self-taught knowledge of engines and was able to plan and carry out actions with a Swiss precision and a German efficiency. Instead, Thornton was socially stunted due to the extremely poor socialization he underwent as a child. It was not that Thornton could not learn --he learned well-- the problem was that he was taught all the wrong things.Still, even as a child, Thornton had an innate concept of right and wrong which propelled his actions. This was exhibited in the handling of his brother and the killing of his mother. Though more mature some 20 years later, this innate sense of right and wrong would continue to rule his life.The other thing that was not explored in the movie was the motivations for the actions of the main character's parents. To be sure, they were odd ducks, but no so odd as to be totally different from humanity. The key in understanding how the child was treated is in understanding the relationship of the parents. It was made clear that Karl's mother was caught cheating on his father. But it may be the case that she was a habitual cheater and that Robert Duvall, who played Karl's father, doubted the paternity of both children. He proclaims in the movie, \"I have no son.\" He did not accept either child and was brutal in the handling of both.It is likely that the son was \"taught\" the same skewered values of right and wrong and just and acceptable retribution from his parents. He had been taught, and as much as he tried to rise above what he knew was viewed as wrong by the majority of civilization, he was in the end bound by it. Understanding this is to understand the character.",

            "content": "in response to core: the points you highlight as weak spots in the film, are somewhat silly. First the \"I'm proud of you\" line illustrates how much Karl cares for the boy, and second Karl doesn't understand fully the statement anyway, most likely it's something Karl wishes someone(his own father) had said to him. Further Karl wishes the boy could be spared a fate he feels he has suffered, the man is simple but as the film illustrates he is a savant in key ways. -second the fact that Doyle is not a medieval personification of evil ads to the depth of the story placing a tragic element upon his murder. This film was brilliant and a masterpiece.",

            "content": "Though this movie has been out a long time and I'm posting a late comment, a recent viewing of this film convinced me all over again, and attests to the far ranging talents of, and depth of interpretation by Billy Bob Thornton. It required some time for this film to capture it's dedicated audience, and all the while Billy Bob is completing other projects, moving ahead and plying his craft in other films, this one will stand the test of time.The plot and it's characters move along with a pace that is readily understood by one who lived in the heart of dixie for 40 years.The talented cast of this film from Billy Bob's perfectly interpreted portrayal of Karl, the brooding and yet calculating simpleton, to the conflicted and hostile, frustrated Doyle, so easily brought to life by Dwight Yokum, this film breathes with realism. Never mind if one knows how it might end...How many of us claim to be prophetic when we sit and see a movie for the first time and leave the theater or our favorite chair and declare \"I knew it would end that way!\"....so what...and in knowing that, even after watching this movie dozens of times, it will get your mind off the popcorn bowl and soft drink every time. Hope if you haven't seen this one, you will take the time and enjoy a well crafted film from the mind of one of the greatest to lend his talents to the film industry.",

I really enjoyed their performances, and have nothing at all witty to say...I was fascinated by the fact that they were not recognizable as themselves.  That, I feel, is a great performance. I did not even notice who they were. The story was very thought provoking and entertaining....what else can we ask from a movie?",

I think the acting in this film by Thorton, Ritter, Black, Walsh and Yoakum were some of the best I have seen respectively from each of them in the movies I have seen them in.  A tribute to Ritter was that I did not even realize it was him in the film until about halfway through it.  Also, I think Yoakum should give up singing for awhile and concentrate on character acting!!! He was phonemenal in this picture.  Thornton's disipline in staying in character during this film says loads for his acting ability.  Black's honestly and dialect give this film a country town aura that lends much to the plot.  Walsh, portrayed his character in a manner that made you want to ensure he was kept in the hospital forever!!!  I thoroughly enjoyed this film!!!",

It's a small world with few people in rural areas where people often live in sheds and the garages...Billy Bob Thornton's performance as Carl is Oscar worthy. He completely disappears into the character as a humble complex man who cares deeply though burdened with frighteningly raw anger.Dwight Yoakam as Doyle is the most realistic violent drunk I've seen yet in a film. His performance is underrated.Lucas Black as Frank is also deeply underrated and underappreciated.The soundtrack that accompanies the movie creates an unsettling and occasionally lighthearted atmosphere. The use of silence and background noise have a chilling effect.",

It's all pure acting, and some of the best I've seen.Karl is one of the most believable, authentic characters I've seen, and it doesn't look like an easy role to pull off. He is perfectly portrayed, and mannerisms are realistic and consistent throughout the film.I won't throw in any spoilers here; I urge you to see this film if you haven't yet.

            "content": "Concerned with some of the dark pits of the human soul, Sling Blade is an interesting and emotionally captivating movie to watch. It is a demonstration of how ill behaviour can cause violence to surge up in human relationships... At the same time, Sling Blade points out some socially sensitive truths about the rights of the mentally disabled, as well as the immaturity that (still) exists in our society, regarding how society views them.The viewer cannot help but feel attached to Karl, the mentally disabled protagonist of the story, within the first couple of minutes. Indeed, the acting is great, especially considering that the roles played are not typical ones.There are, however, some flaws in the plot... for example, I cannot believe that Doyle just sat there, pathetically reading his newspaper, waiting to get hit in the head by a lawnmower blade... Even for someone who disrespects and looks down his nose to \"retards\", I believe that he should have felt at least a bit threatened (this also contradicts his anxiety because of Karl's earlier nightly walk with a hammer). In addition, I just cannot accept that the boy, Frank, took orders from Doyle without resenting and only limited himself to throwing some angry looks. It just doesn't make sense... Also, I don't think that mentally ill people who have been treated and then released back into society would just live without any supervision...I can forgive, at least to some extent, the aforementioned mistakes, since the acting was so great and really convincing... Nevertheless, I don't think Sling Blade is going to stay with me for a long time... It was moving, emotionally intense, and thought-provoking, but it lacked impressiveness. All in all, I would encourage you to watch the movie if you enjoy the genre.",

His friendship with Frank (Lucas Black) is charming and unusual, and almost instant. Lucas Black, as a young child, is unbelievable as an actor. I don't want to say too much.

Ritter plays his part great - such a departure from what he's best known for. The background story leading into the story and Carl revisiting that story showing his arc is fantastic. The fact that Duvall and Walsh (two of my favorites. Walsh gone too soon should have been a bigger part in bigger movies) took such small roles shows the art that was intrinsic in this film. The final scene with Ritter was beyond sweet with Ritter's surprise of Karl's approval seeming so genuine. A wonderful film that, if it's on, I'm watching.",

There is symbolism in every scene, that captures your imagination and curiosity, leading you into the next scene until you know without a doubt how it must end. There is a little 'tongue in cheek' speckled throughout the film, just enough to make you laugh occasionally. You really need to pay attention to the characters' actions and words because everything is eventually connected.I'm not a big fan of Billy Bob Thorton, but he's impressive in this movie. He does such a magnificent job with his character, Karl, that you don't recognize him right away. Dwight Yokum is also fantastic. He really nails that incredibly spiteful personality that you wish someone would kill. I was a bit surprised by John Ritter's appearance as the gay friend; it was really unexpected, but so was Robert Duvall's bit part. Thorton has proved his abilities acting and directing, but of his entire career so far, this is his best work at both.",

Sling Blade help improve a flaw beheld in my personal character, again I learned another valuable lesson of life for my error of pre-judgement. Throughout the movie I was expecting at some point that 'ALL HELL' was going to break loose, but the movie never unleashed the nightmare violence I expected to happen at some point in the film. Instead I was to be treated to an excellent drama of a most special type, the contents of which for me were completely 'unpredictable'.
