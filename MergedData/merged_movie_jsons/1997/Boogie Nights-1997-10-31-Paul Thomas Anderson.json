            "content": "'Boogie Nights' is more than a great film even, it's fantastic and more worthy of even more praise than it already gets.What is immediately impressive after finishing is how it tackles the subject matters of pornography, disco and drugs, very difficult subjects to portray in any media without being too trashy or causing offence but 'Boogie Nights' manages to make a film that commits neither of those things (even with the sex and drug abuse being prominent, they all have their full impact without being over-the-top or trivialised) and instead make one that's interesting and entertaining as well as disturbing and emotional. Few films that include even one of these subjects have succeeded in doing that so well.It looks stunning for a start, with an imaginative surreal touch to the lighting and kinetic cinematography (though also with the trademark long takes and tracking shots that is immediately distinctive of Paul Thomas Anderson) and audacious costuming. Visually the standout is the opening Steadicam shot, it's breathtaking and famous for very good reason. The disco soundtrack is a perfect fit, it's infectious, effectively sleazy, sometimes deliciously ironic and also makes one want to dance with the characters and nostalgic for the 80s.The screenplay was nominated for an Oscar, and with its perfect balance of the hilarious, the poignant and the darkly disturbing it's a worthy nomination. Even with the huge two and a half hour length (it may be argued by some that the film is too long), there is rarely if at all a dull stretch in the story, which explores the adult entertainment industry and the American Dream in ways that are startling, hugely entertaining and poignant.Anderson does a wonderful job directing, not just with the telling of the story and keeping the atmosphere consistent but also in making the characters compelling and in his direction of actors (some of the best of any modern-day director) and their interaction. The acting is one of the biggest reasons why 'Boogie Nights' works so well. Mark Wahlberg has never been better, anybody who doubts his abilities as an actor should see this, and Burt Reynolds is brilliant in one of his career's finest performances in his \"comeback\" role. There are scintillating turns from Heather Graham and especially Julianne Moore (along with Reynolds also Oscar-nominated, again worthy nominations and would have been even worthier winners), and also fabulous support from Don Cheadle, William H. Macy, Philip Seymour Hoffmann, a hugely entertaining John C. Reilly (even if the role occasionally threatens to strain credibility but thankfully it never does) and a gloriously unhinged Alfred Molina.Overall, fantastic film. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "Boogie Nights is one of the best films to come out of the 90's and I'd go so far as to say it should be in the IMDb top 250. I can actually understand why many would dislike it, due to the subject matter. I personally feel however as many do, judging from the aclaim this film's received by viewers and critics that it's topnotch film making.The direction and acting in this film surpass good and reach the level of brilliance.There is not one scene in this movie that isn't amazing. The individual characters reach out and touch you. Given that this is a movie about the porn industry, one wouldn't imagine the sex scenes could be handled with such sensitivity but they are. The direction is among the best I've ever seen-and I've seen a lot of films.The film isn't about one particular personal individual's story, it's about many.It's a character study about people who have many layers to them and who maybe in an industry most would find alien but who still dream the same dreams and have both bad and good to them. Boogie Nights draws you into their story from the beginning, and though the film is long(I believe almost 3 hours) you honestly don't even notice. And when it ends you kind of don't want it to....I'm not easy to impress, meaning there aren't many movies I'd give a 10 of 10 rating to but this is one. Beyond the multiple character study, is the use of music in the film. I have never, in all my years of seeing movies seen music tell a story as well as in this movie.There was such flawlessness to it, you know it's not something your gonna see everyday.Burt reynold's performance was perhaps the best I've ever seen him do, and Mark Wahlberg is incredible(I'm astounded there are still people saying he doesn't act well. I don't know how anyone viewing this could possibly think that)but the person who really surprised me was Heather Grahem(Rollergirl) who is absolutely fantastic in her role, in particular the one memorable scene with Burt Reynolds in the Limo, towards the end.Again, I'll echo other IMDb reviewers in saying this movie is not for everybody. But I still think this was topnotch.10 of 10.",

            "content": "Director Paul Thomas Anderson has created a fascinating account of a family of pornographers in the late 1970s.  It is a frank, compelling, and disturbing vignette of unforgettable characters.  Mark Whalberg (in his best performance to date) plays a well-endowed 17 year old who begins working in the porn industry under porn director Burt Reynolds (in an Oscar nominated performance).  John C. Reilly plays a fellow porn star, Julianne Moore (never better) as a famous porn queen, Philip Seymour Hoffman as a timid homosexual porn crew member, William H. Macy as a fatalistic loser who's wife is always cheating on him, and Heather Graham (Reynolds daughter) as a rising porn star.  Everybody does a fine job.  The best scenes belong to former porn star couple Don Cheadle and Nicole Parker who add some of the comic relief to the film.  What's intriguing is the way the actors interact with each other and the way they struggle to find their self-identity, plus a bravura script, colorful and startling cinematography, and a rousing rocking 70s soundtrack that make Boogie Nights one of the best films of 1997.  It is a touching, humorous, and shocking film bursting with originality with an overall message of: redemption and forgiveness.",

            "content": "Boogie Nights (1997) is a movie I recently watched on HBOMAX. The storyline follows a young man who hasn't lived up to his parents expectations but has found a way to make a living and get rich in a way they definitely wouldn't approve - porn. He quickly becomes famous due to his long member. Life in the 70s as a porn star contains many unique highlights but also many potential pitfalls. This movie is directed by Paul Thomas Anderson (There Will be Blood) and stars Mark Wahlberg (The Departed), Luis Guzm\u00e1n (Traffic), Burt Reynolds (Smokey and the Bandit), Julianne Moore (Magnolia), Don Cheadle (Crash) and Heather Graham (Austin Powers). The storyline for this is so unique and well told. The depiction of the 70s was excellent as was the soundtrack. The acting is outstanding and the writing and dialogue was perfect as was Damon as the main character. The circumstances are hilarious and the end is perfection based on the storyline. Overall this is an underrated masterpiece that is a must see and an easy 10/10 that I'd strongly recommend.",

After being numbed by a decade's worth of stark, Kevin Smith-style indie banalities, I just wasn't used to seeing a movie that covered that much emotional and cultural ground.

            "content": "It takes genius to make a believable film about the porn industry that makes us care about its characters, and for me, this movie accomplishes that nearly-impossible task. \"Boogie Nights\" is a film about the adult film industry in the 70's and early 80's, and even though the \"sleaze\" is there--it is done with style, humor, and taste. Eddie Adams aka Dirk Diggler (Mark Wahlberg) is a charming but not-very-bright 17-year old dishwasher who is \"discovered\" by Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds), a fatherly adult filmmaker in 1977. The movie tracks his career and life over the next 8 years, as well as the other members of Jack's \"family.\" The camera follows its many characters from scene to scene with a certain joyfulness, and we come to care about all of them deeply, no matter how small their roles.  There is a perfect balance of the hilarious and the tragic, and the fast pace never lets up. The end of the '70s' ends with a literal *bang*, which is totally appropriate and marks not only the end of a decade, but the shift in mood from a party-atmosphere to one of growing tension. The soundtrack is wonderful, with the songs not only appropriate for the time period, but also to underscore the feeling of each scene. There is a scene, late in the film, that must be seen to be believed. In it, Dirk Diggler and two of his druggie friends go to the home of a drug-dealer to try to rip him off. The interplay of hilarity and tension is almost unbearable. A little Chinese boy walks around the room setting off firecrackers as a crack-addled bathrobe-clad Alfred Molina (as the drug lord) rants and raves and sings along with \"Sister Christian\" and \"Jesse's Girl\" which blast on the stereo. We can feel the characters' uneasiness and sense of danger each time another firecracker goes off. Everyone should see this movie. There's never been another like it.",

            "content": "Paul Thomas Anderson's stylish and compelling take on the 70s porn industry follows Eddie Adams, aka Dirk Diggler (Mark Wahlberg), through six years of sex, drugs and disco. His chance meeting with pornography director Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds) starts his career as one of the greatest adult actors of the time. Dirk's character is based on real-life porn actor John Holmes, who, like Dirk, was renowned for being extremely \"well-endowed\". This is where Dirk finds initial success.The main themes in Boogie Nights are the obvious ones relating to a film of this genre; pornography, drugs, sex, betrayal, violence and music. Boogie Nights deals with the pornography theme with some control. It is not overplayed and the sex scenes are surprisingly minimal, but mentally explicit when they take place on screen.Throughout the film cocaine is abused enormously, and the film's setting, Los Angeles 1977-1983, reflects the popularity of the drug at that time, which the film captures perfectly. However, Boogie Nights does not promote cocaine, as there are some scenes involving addiction and overdoses. For example at Jack's party, they find a girl who has recently, and graphically, overdosed; blood pours from her nose and she begins an unconscious fit. The film, before this scenes, has been fairly upbeat and comic, but from this point it foreshadows the darkness that it will occur.The music scenes are executed brilliantly, from superbly-staged disco scenes to a down-and-out Dirk singing terribly in his new music career. The soundtrack too is excellent, featuring tunes from The Emotions, ELO, The Beach Boys and the unforgettable Sound Experience. The standout scene in the whole film comes down to the music; Dirk, Redd Rothchild (John C. Reilly) and Todd Parker (Thomas Jane) visit drug dealer Rahad Jackson's (Alfred Molina) house in order to make some quick cash from selling phoney drugs, but Night Ranger's Sister Christian, which is playing in the background, increases the intensity of the scene incredibly, proving that music can bring so much more depth to a scene. Boogie Nights is filled with those kind of scenes, which makes the film even more fantastic.The standout performance in Boogie Nights is Burt Reynolds as the enigmatic, yet moody, film director. In the scene where he attacks a young guy for slating his movies, it is a complete shock for the audience, because before this point he has been pretty mellow and content. Other notable performances are Julianne Moore, Heather Graham as the beautiful Rollergirl, John C. Reilly, and Mark Wahlberg, who delivers the performance of his career.Boogie Nights is also a surprisingly original film, using common themes but filmed in its own sharp and realistic way. Anderson's approach has been fully captures these characters in a time when nothing seemed to be going wrong, or at least until the 80s arrive. From then on, things turn very dark indeed, and all signs of the recognisable characters and situations from the first part of the film have gone. This does not, however, reduce the high level of engaging entertainment that this film offers.Boogie Nights was not a box-office success, earning only \u00a32 million at cinemas in the UK. But this is not the film's, or the director's concern. Anderson recognises quality, not popularity, which is evident in his three other films, Hard Eight, Magnolia and Punch-Drunk Love. I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a simple parable filled with excellent and variable situations, because at the end of this film you will realize that Boogie Nights is a simple morality tale, but one which will stay in the mind days after you watch it. Boogie Nights is at once shocking, hilarious, devastating and both visually and audibly outstanding.",

            "content": "Being Saturday evening (comedy night in our house),my wife and I sat down to watch a supposedly funny movie called \"Boogie Nights\". The only thing I had heard about it was that my sister-in-law told us not to see it because it was bawdy and she walked out, so right away I knew it was worth watching. This movie was nothing like we thought it was going to be like--it was a fantastic and quite involving drama, which deserved a few Oscars. The time frames from the early 70's to the mid 80's were flawless, and the \"glamor\" of the porn industry was effectively dispelled by the portrayal of the stars. One of the most memorable scenes of all times, in my opinion was the drug deal gone bad, the firecrackers, the guy in the bathrobe and the utter uneasiness of the deposed porn stars as we listened to \"Jessie's Girl\" and \"Sister Christian\". Burt Reynolds was great as Jack Horner, the director who made money with young energy and the coming trends, but realized he had to be \"father\" to all those aging stars who had nowhere else to go once the bright lights began to flicker and the money was getting thin.",

The title is very misleading to some who do not generally read reviews beforehand.  This movie is an exhilerating piece on a late 70's-early 80's porn star.  Yes, it sounds like a very simple plot and much gratutious sex.  But it's so much more. While you may be thrown off by the violence and the sexuality Boogie Nights is nowhere near pointless.  It features great acting all across the board-even Reynolds is very sympathetic.  Some advice though, seeing this movie more than once is a good idea.  It grows on you. This movie takes you to the deep down threshold of your heart.  It shows you the rise of a porn star and the downhill spiral that follows it.  Even in some of the sleaziest of characters can a human being be reached out to.  Rent this one tonight -  and who cares about all that talk about the use of prosthetics anyway.        This is the pulp fiction of the 70's porn industry, \"a low class subject made in a high class way\".",

            "content": "SOME SPOILERS\"Boogie Nights\" may well be the best film of the 1990s.  I cannot remember the last time I was so overwhelmed by a new film.Interestingly, I was not planning to see it.  I knew nothing about the director, I've never cared for Burt Reynolds, and the only thing I knew about Mark Wahlberg is that he had been an annoying boy singer and Calvin Klein model.  Nor was I all that interested in seeing the story of an extremely well-endowed porn star.A couple of months ago, I tuned in, about 20 minutes into the film, when \"Boogie nights\" was on cable -- and I was hooked.  I have seen the entire film twice, and it has become one of my favorites.First of all, P.T. Anderson is brilliant ... it's daunting to think he was only 27 when \"BN\" was made.  Despite the \"borrowing\" from Scorsese and Altman, I believe he brings a profoundly individual vision to his work. What sets him apart is that his keen observation and satirical vision are enhanced by warmth, compassion, indeed love for the people who populate his film.Is Anderson \"judgmental\" toward his characters?  A friend who watched \"BN\" at my suggestion said that one thing he loved about the film is that it's moral but not moralistic.  Anderson makes it clear that these people's lifestyle is often destructive.   The critics who complained about the abrupt shift from hedonistic fun in the '70s to horror and disintegration in the '80s were mistaken.  The first half has many intimations of darkness: the girl who ODs on coke at Jack's party, face streaked with blood, limbs twitching; Amber's son trying in vain to reach her at the party; Little Bill's anguish at his wife's infidelities.  Clearly, too, most of these people aren't very smart, and their pretensions -- Dirk's belief in his stardom, Jack's belief in his \"art\" -- are ridiculous.  Yet we never lose connection with their basic humanity.  When Amber/Maggie is denied visitation with her son, we know it was probably the right decision yet we sympathize with her anguish.It's the ultimate cliche to say that a film will make you laugh and cry. With \"BN,\" it happens to be true.  The \"Brock Landers\" clips and the preparations for Eddie/Dirk's porno debut are just two of the riotously funny scenes.  On the other hand, the confrontation between Eddie and his mother or the scene of Dirk coming back to Jack asking for help have more genuine emotion and poignancy in a few brief minutes than there was in all of \"Titanic.\"  And some scenes are both comical and moving (Amber and Rollergirl talking as they snort coke, Scotty making a pass at Dirk).This film will also make you think, without beating you over the head with a message (the way \"Three Kings\" does, for instance).  Many say that its theme is family; but equally important is the theme of self-deception.  Most of the characters are prisoners of their dreams and delusions.   For Jack and Dirk, it's the delusions of glory and greatness; in Amber's case, her self-image as a good mother.  (Right after telling Dirk she sees him as a son, she introduces him to cocaine -- his eventual undoing.)  Why do Jack and Rollergirl unleash their fury on Rollergirl's former classmate? Because, with his comment on how squalid their lives actually are, reality intrudes on their self-enclosed world of illusion, and they can't take it.There's no real \"happy ending,\" either.  At the end, Jack has reconciled himself to being a rich hack.  A wistful-looking Amber sits at her makeup table; while Jack tells her she's the \"foxiest bitch in the world,\" clearly her looks will be more and more difficult to keep up.  As for Dirk, he has presumably kicked the drug problem and is back working, looking slick yet somehow lifeless.  Note that in the infamous final shot, when he exposes his penis in front of the mirror, we don't see his face.  He has been dehumanized, reduced to a sex machine -- and that's all there will ever be for him.  (Think of the early scene of Eddie telling his girlfriend, \"I'm going to be a star, a big bright shining star,\" his eyes gleaming, his voice aglow with hope, and contrast it with him saying at the end, \"I am a star. A big bright shining star\" -- his voice flat, his face invisible ... the real \"star\" is his penis.)Despite the film's setting in the porn industry, I think \"BN\" has something to say about the larger culture of media glitz and celebrity-seeking.A word about the acting.  Burt Reynolds is superb; Julianne Moore truly shines.  (It takes courage for a female movie star to take on a part where she often appears physically unattractive.)  Philip Seymour Hoffman, Alfred Molina, John C. Reilly and Heather Graham stand out in a supporting cast that doesn't have a single bad performance.  As for Mark Wahlberg, he proves himself to be one of the finest young actors working today.  He is utterly convincing as he shows Eddie/Dirk's evolution from an eager-to-please, innocently amoral kid with a dopey but radiant smile to an obnoxious, egomaniacal, paranoid prima donna, and then the despair of his downfall. During the drug-deal scene, there's a close-up of his face for more than a minute, with no dialogue, and he conveys a complex range of emotion as Dirk \"spaces out\" listening to \"Jesse's Girl\" -- obviously thinking of better days, then of how low he has fallen -- and then snaps back to reality and is terrified.\"BN\" is not without weaknesses.  A few scenes are too long; the theme of Amber's \"mother\" role is overemphasized; a few plot strands are left unresolved (were there any legal consequences to Jack's and Rollergirl's assault on the guy in the limo, or to the drug deal/attempted robbery that ended in two dead bodies?).  But these are minor flaws in a near-perfect work.",

            "content": "Boogie Nights is perhaps one of the greatest examples any would-be filmmaker should take a long hard look at.  Sure, you could spend loads of quality time reviewing the clasics from Hitchcock to Scorsese; but lets follow suit for the modern generation and study half-heartedly.Where to begin, I suppose one could look at the film as simply a story, perhaps even docudrama which focuses on the late 1970's porn industry-and what an industry it was!  The other half could focus on the incredible detail one brillant filmmaker can achieve simply by using polyester and *ahem* rubber.  But honestly, Boogie Nights brings back the pure, no-bul!shi$, in your face kind of cinema I haven't experienced since the film greats of the 1970's...ironic...or stroke of genius.  The story is full of richly detailed characters, all of which you either can relate too, love, or hate; but the impact is clear-you are feeling something for them.  Among the characters the two performances which stand out are: Burt Reynolds as Director Jack Horner, and Mark Wahlberg as Eddie Adams/Dirk Diggler. Julianne Moore is also brillant, as is Heather Graham...but if I focus on any one actor it would have to be John C. Reilly.  John's performance is a perfect balance of comedic timing and character driven emotion...I'm a sucker for the line \"Ever see the movie Star Wars?...People say I look like Han Solo.\"  Anyway, the look of the film is incredible, the Director of Photography and Director/Writer/Producer, have come up with a vibrant colour, and flashy style that compares to Martin Scorsese, and Stanley Kubrick(in terms of his perfection of his craft); but with creating his own unique look, and pushing the edge with the longest single shot I'ver ever seen...that being the New Year's party sequence.The music, like in any great film, is a character of its own.  At times, it consumes oneself with sorrow or grief...but mainly its all about fun, dancing, and having a good time; the spirit of the 1970's. OK, back to the performances.Burt Reynolds plays the character of Jack Horner, a porn director who feels the burden of what the future of \"film\" means to his genre.  The awful transition from shooting on film to recording on magnetic tape. The lose of his art, as it were...and the changes in mentality to the people he works with.  Walhberg adds the perfect blend of innocense and sexual bravado needed for the character.  For all those individuals who have seen Burton's Planet of the Apes, pay no attention to the performance of Wahlberg in that film...rent boogie nights and see what a difference a good script can make!Julianne Moore plays the would-be mother to all, and with that comes the torment and anguish she feels, as life imitates art; and she loses all those close to her.  Heather Graham is the eye-candy, but later holds her own, and steals some of the scenes from even the great Mr. Reynolds himself.  Each character is multidimensional, rich with life, and performed by actors that seem to be picture perfect for the part.The film itself is often funny, tragic, exciting, and provides a uncompromising look into the turblulant lifestyle of the fast-pace 1970's. It makes no excuses, and tells no lies; and offers the audience a trip back. But even more importantly, the movie gives us a grand example of how films should be made; and a new director whose bold visions bring back art in film.",

Something for everyone here.. almost camouflaged as issues of untouchables and their separate milieu but of course they are universal.The film works on a number of levels.

It is a homage to the pornography culture and to adults who will never grow up in California.  The film also has brilliant acting, writing and camera work and is P.T. Anderson's best work yet.Some of the great stuff in this film is the acting which is some of the best of the decade.  Including Burt Reynolds as the director Jack Horner (this is his best piece of acting since the 70's), Julianne Moore as the struggling mother Amber Waves to the young actors and in a very good performance, and Mark Wahlberg in his best performance yet as the kid Dirk Diggler with something extra (13 inches to be exact) that will make him a star.  Also, the supporting cast is top notch and provides a lot of unintentional and sick comedy.But the real good stuff comes from the director Anderson.  He gives us a look into a subject no one else has seen before (or has wanted to see).  The writing is funny and touching and the length gives the film time to sprawl into the masterpiece that it is.  One of the best of 1997.",

            "content": "This is an excellent movie that is vibrant, colourful and powerful. The performances are all very good, but the big surprise is the return of Burt Reynolds. His performance is the most notable, and he duly rewarded with a Golden Globe and an Academy Award nomination. Boogie Nights is about the pornography industry in the 70's, and how it all fell apart in the 80's. The first half, revolving around the 70's, is plausible and believable; entertaining and informative. Although the film falls apart in the second half, and descends into a lot of unnecessary, graphic violence.Eddie Adams (Mark Wahlberg) is the protagonist of the movie. He is spotted one night at a club by porn king Jack Warner (Reynolds), and is offered a deal to star in a movie. Warner remarks that, \"I just know there's somethin' wonderful under those jeans just waitin' to get out.\" And that marks the entrance for Eddie into the sleazy, slutty, though human world of porn and sex. Boogie Nights follows his first appearance as a naive young actor to a drug hampered, egomaniacal lunatic who spirals down into the world of crime and Cocaine. Along the way, it deals with sub plots dealing with pornography and the surrogate families that establish themselves amidst the echelons; the prejudice that society carries to porn stars and the dirty, utterly disgraceful life they lead.Although the film deals with sex and porn, there is not an obscene amount of it, and the director censors these scenes so it is not explicit. The viewers gather that Eddie Adams (or Dirk Diggler, the pseudonym he assumes for acting) has a prodigious member lurking under his jeans. But, until the final scene, all we see to indicate that is the stunned reactions by peers and onlookers.The script is very good, but the film is overly long. It could be called an epic at a length of 155 minutes, but the time passes quickly. Despite Boogie Nights' flaws and shortfalls, it is a very good movie worthy of the acclaim it received.Nine out of ten.",

            "content": "Eddie Adams is an affable young man who has dropped out of high school and is working a kitchen in a night club when he is approached by \"film\" director Jack Horner who has heard about Eddie's \"skills\". Jack convinces Eddie to take part in one of his films with his regular cast and crew and it isn't long before Eddie is loving every second of his new job and circle of friends. Disco is in, flares are in and porn is enjoying its quality years of expensive production on proper film stock. However with the arrival of the eighties and video the world of porn changes and so does Eddie's.Paul Thomas Anderson's feature film is an impressive achievement in delivery and scope. The material spans decades and follows characters in and around the porn industry at the time. Although it is set in the porn industry and will require the audience to be tolerant of the same, the story is more about the characters than any specific story. This is not to say that its strength is in its depth because this doesn't offer an insight into the bowels of the porn industry and how it affects people. Naturally the whole thing is very much a cautionary tale but this is not the same as having depth. This may seem like a criticism but in reality the film survives with the depth it has as aims for a sweep of the eras.In this regard it succeeds because the feel of the period is really well done and the overall delivery is strong. At times it does feel like Anderson has raided Scorsese's playbook (especially in regards the soundtrack and the use of long tracking shots) but generally it is impressive. Visually the film is high energy and the soundtrack barely has a bum note in it. Where Anderson has really landed on his feet is his cast because few directors get a line-up this impressive so early in their career. Wahlberg is good although he is helped by the fact that the material jumps from Eddie to Dirk with the jump between decades; this way Wahlberg doesn't have to blend his character so much as make a step change (which in fairness he does do well). Reynolds may have been so clueless that he disowned the film before embracing his awards but he is very good in his supporting role \u0096 probably better than he has been for years (although that is not saying much). The depth of the cast is a real strength. Moore is impressive as always with her character varying between confidence and damaged goods, she is real and convincing. Graham has less to work with but is still good while Reilly, Cheadle, Guzm\u00e1n, Hoffman, Macy, Hall and others all deliver the type of quality that we have come to expect from them.Overall then a very enjoyable film whose lack of depth in the cautionary morality tale is covered by a really good delivery from Anderson and his talented cast. The adult material may limit its audience or in some way increase its \"cool\" quotient, but either way it is an engaging and energetic film from a young director.",

            "content": "An affectionate look at the Golden Age of porn movies, from the late 1970s to, say, the early 1980s. The cast list is filled with familiar names who deliver the goods with expected skill. Philip Seymour Hoffman is unusually fine but then they're almost all outstanding.No need to carry on about the content. It's not prurient. There's very little nudity and the simulated sex is not as exploitative as it is in many far less ambitious and thoughtful erotic thrillers -- \"Body of Evidence,\" for instance, or \"Masquerade.\" I'll give an example of some of the acting talent on display here. Julianne Moore is a splendid performer who has become a familiar name not because of her appearance -- she's hardly gorgeous by Hollywood standards -- but because of the subtlety with which she uses her instrument. In \"Boogie Nights\" she plays the wife of Burt Reynolds, a kind of surrogate mother to the cast and crew of the flicks Burt turns out and Moore acts in. There is an important scene in which she and Mark Wahlberg, as a tyro with a preposterous pylon, a monumental masculinity, make love on screen for the first time. He's a nervous wreck, but she's gentle and real and makes him feel less anxious simply by being accommodating. And then the scene is filmed. (One take. Two would cost too much money.) And Moore adopts the character she's playing in the skin flick. In her filmed conversation with Wahlman she strips herself of her natural talent and becomes the kind of fake with the artificial voice that populates the skin flicks of the 70s. She acts as if she can't act.The porn film that used to be shown in theaters goes out of style in the 1980s. Films are now videotaped and Burt Reynolds, who yearns to make a \"real film\" that he will be \"remembered for,\" balks at the change. Neither Reynolds nor anyone else seems to realize that the social world they've built is as evanescent, as friable, as the disco music that serves as its accompaniment. Everything goes downhill, undone not so much by prudery as by properties inherent in the occupation, the Zeitgeist, and, in fact, in human nature -- political correctness, technology, coke, celebrity, materialism, ego, hoary feminist inevitabilities, and the general decadence to which social movements are prone.The direction? Forget that this is a movie about sex and watch the scene towards the end in which Wahlberg and two of his friends visit the house of a rich rock star with the intention of robbing him of all the money he is said to keep in his safe. Things begin to go wrong. The rock star is high as a kite, he has a big black associate armed with two pistols, the pointless electric guitars and percussion from the stereo fill the air with din, an unexpected Chinese guest is setting off firecrackers and each bang makes the three would-be thieves jump in their seats. There is a generous amount of tension in this scene and it would do justice to any more \"respectable\" movie.In the end, things have quieted down and have become quietly peaceful and quietly quiet. The movie's not a tragedy but the story of a tough and uncertain journey through particularly turbulent times, which not all the participants manage to survive.It's pretty good.",

The porn-industry is a mess in more ways than one and there is much to criticize, and i know this movie has been considered to glorify the business. Something i don't agree with.The story about Dirk Diggler and his exploding porn-career in the late 1970's - early 1980's bears considerable similarity with that of John Holmes and the fact that Holmes has been an inspiration is obvious. The thing i most appreciated about this movie is the way that it shows both sides of the business. At first the upside where the young kid is introduced to a world of sex, drugs and rich friendly people. Then later the backside with crime, abuse and crashed lives. And it's all done with an excellent mix of comedy and drama as well as a distinct feeling when it comes to style. Visual as well as otherwise.Despite being a movie about the porno business, Boogie Nights is not very explicit. A correct choice in my opinion since more explicit scenes wouldn't have added to the movie, rather it would instead have run the risk of feeling like exploitation. Paul Thomas Anderson is a talented director and he manages to balance many talented actors in a good way while still letting it be his more than their film. Also i don't know what he did with Mark Wahlberg, but suddenly he could act! I don't like Wahlberg at all otherwise but here even he performed well.Boogie Nights is well worth seeing even if you completely despise the porno industry. There is room for more than one opinion here and Anderson doesn't really state his own. I rate this 7/10.",

            "content": "At the heart of Boogie Nights is a group of people that are so cavalier and nonchalant about sex. Julianne Moore has an intensely maternal love for Dirk Diggler yet has no qualms at all about having sex with him repeatedly for a film. They are totally nonchalant about private parts. At one point, for instance, Robert Ridgley asks Wahlberg if he can see his cock, Wahlberg shows him, and Ridgley thanks him. They are extremely careless with drugs. What is uncanny about writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson's story is how he portrays a group of people so casual and detached regarding these things that they are cavalier and nonchalant when it is simply amiss to be so, specifically. Macy and his porn star wife constantly humiliates him by frequently having sex with muscular younger men in public places, or when a woman OD's on a guy at a party and everyone but the guy is calm and matter-of-fact about taking care of the situation.PTA isn't afraid to have a lot of peripheral characters that are overlooked by a lot of the central ones, such as Philip Seymour Hoffman's gay, nebbishy boom operator who loves and follows Dirk, Don Cheadle's unlikely black country-western follower, William H. Macy's frustrated assistant director, and Melora Walters's timid porn actress. Some of them bond and find great luck, others remain lonely and find tragedy that serves as omens for harder times for the characters as a collective conscious.I first saw Boogie Nights as a sophomore in high school. I was a virgin. Now that I'm not, it's that much more fascinating to watch scenes like the first time Diggler is before the camera having sex with Julianne Moore, not just because of its admirably unapologetic realism but because of how gifted a porn actor must be. There are so many strangers watching, unexpected interruptions and overall lack of familiarity with the situation, throughout all of which you must maintain an erection, relentless stamina and making the act look as sexy as you can to non-participants who are watching it.In terms of Dirk Diggler's character, Anderson reflects the very intimate and fragile male issue of the fear of impotence by constructing a major character stumbling block out of it. As Diggler grows more and more addicted to cocaine, he finds it more and more difficult to achieve an erection when he needs to, winding up internalizing this panic and frustration and beginning the crumbling of a big house of cards. Anderson has the confidence and humility to portray this obstacle under an inevitable magnifying lens, as Diggler's \"one special thing\" is his thirteen-inch penis.The most resonant talent that Anderson shows specifically as a director is that the film is high brow in terms of production values and the effect and quality of the story and the acting, but it is essentially a movie about a guy's amazing penis, and the film offers hilariously crude sex humor and pitch-perfect individual degrees of stupidity in the characters, and in the uncanny depiction of terrible quality in the porn films within the film, the Brock Landers/Chest Rockwell films for instance, mostly in the cast's hysterical portrayals of horrible acting and the horribly staged and filmed action violence.Paul Thomas Anderson's films are mysterious wonders, because each of them, in their own respective ways, is about so many things. Boogie Nights is a period piece about the porn business. It's about a group of people that coagulate like the hierarchy of a large family through the years. It's about a dense young man whose penis leads him to stardom and leads him into a lot of trouble. It's about the control of less intelligent, less sensitive people over the compliant intelligent and sensitive ones. It's about fate and coincidence. The pleasures and dangers of sex and drugs. The id of the 1970s and '80s. Everything about this dynamite stick of talent is grippingly unanticipated.Not many films have been more blunt, even disillusioned, concerning sexuality. Porn movies are a business to these people, not a distraction, and one of the charms of this period entertainment industry drama is the manner in which it showcases the day-by-day behind- the-scenes routine life of pornographers. The range and diversity is reminiscent of films by one of Anderson's biggest influences, Robert Altman, but there is also some of the consistent charm of low-budget breakthrough films of the 1990s, in scenes that stay poised riskily flanked by hilarity and graphic violence. Throughout all the characters and drama, Anderson's script focuses on the emotional facets of them. Boogie Nights has the value of most of the great movies, in that it is constantly buzzing and animate.",

            "content": "P.T. Anderson's Boogie Nights is basically a character study of porn industry participants between the years of 1977-1984. We see much of the film through the eyes of a young man who takes the industry by storm at the tender age of 17. We see his rise during the care-free innocence of the later 70s and we witness him bottom out in the early 80s. We are also introduced to several other performers, filmmakers, hangers on, and criminals. Cocaine seems to be the catalyst behind much of the action. This type of film might have been laughable if made by a director with less talent, but Anderson's unique style and skills make it a winner.Mark Wahlberg plays our young stud who takes the name of \"Dirk Diggler\". He's apparently a high school dropout with an enormous penis who catches the attention of a porn director played by Burt Reynolds. Wahlberg's performance begins as properly understated, then seems to grow with the character. Reynolds hasn't been this good since Smokey and the Bandit. The rest of the cast reads like a \"who's who\" of the more respected actors of our day. Don Cheadle is outstanding as a young man who takes pride in his \"acting\", but really wants to open up a stereo store more than anything else. Julianne Moore is is also very good as the maternal figure of the troupe who has basically adopted the younger actors as her own children to replace her real son lost in a custody dispute. There is simply not enough space here to give credit to everyone who acted superbly in this film.Anderson's skill with the camera is on display in numerous shots. Many have been used elsewhere, but he knows how to work them into his story. Many of the scenes take place in crowded rooms or at parties where all kinds of interesting things are going on. His technique often takes us from one room to another, then perhaps outside so we don't miss a thing. The use of soundtrack is perhaps the best of any film I've ever seen. In fact, it IS the best. With so many great songs of the period at his disposal, he works two discs worth into the story. Nothing seems excessive or out of place.If one fault can be found with this film, then I would have to say it would be too much violence in the last half hour. Any industry that deals in sex and drugs to that extent is bound to encounter violence in some circles, but Boogie Nights over does it. I counted no less than five extremely bloody scenes. In one, a VERY young woman overdoses on coke and breaks a blood vessel in her nose. There are several gunshot victims. But the most over-the-top scene would have to be the one where Heather Graham stomps on the head of a young man with her roller skates. The manner in which she comes in contact with him is contrived to the point of hysteria, then the scene ends in such a brutal assault that you'll hardly be able to control your skepticism. The fact that the consequences of the assault are not even revealed to the audience (at least not in any version of the film I've seen) makes you wonder why Anderson thought to include it at all. It was just a means for the young woman to get some revenge on a guy who made fun of her way back in high school. Nothing more.The film lacks any scene which inspires any true sexual feeling from anyone I've ever talked to. This was indeed intended. The sex in the film is all about business, though Graham's brief nude scene was well appreciated. The film is also lacking in any kind of judgment or moral lesson. We are merely introduced to these characters, then we see what happens to them. Despite a near documentary point of view, the film never bogs down or fails to keep one's interest. The film didn't make that much money, but it has earned the distinction of being one of the better films made in the 1990s. A reputation well-deserved.9 of 10 stars from The Hound.",

            "content": "'Boogie Nights' uses its protagonist, Dirk Diggler, as a metaphor for accumulated celebrities from a decade in America's shameful past, which was comprised of an unexpected rise in pornography, therefore resulting in an abundance of corrupted youth. Its lead character borrows traits from a various assortment of genuine actors, involving himself in many illegal affairs that have been dabbled in by celebrities in Hollywood, and all-too-often exploited by the press. It seems like the sort of tall tale that might appear on an E! True Hollywood Story special. Drugs, sex and violence -- the American Dream. But what goes up must come down, and the bigger it is, the harder it falls.Dirk Diggler's dreams are huge, as is another valuable asset on his body. Dirk's real name is Eddie Adams, a Californian who dreams of becoming a star. He believes that God gives one great talent to every individual on the planet, and his gift is a rather unusual one. After falling out with his mother, Eddie leaves home and meets the sleazy Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds), an adult film director who offers him work. Eddie eventually becomes a major porn star, representing the leading \"actor\" in most of Horner's films. With newfound success, Eddie is told that he needs to invent a new alias for himself, and so Dirk Diggler is born.Eddie/Dirk himself is primarily based on infamous porn star John Holmes, whose life story was adapted in 2003 with 'Wonderland', which starred Val Kilmer. 'Boogie Nights' is unarguably the better of the two, proving that movies about pornography can be made without disgusting its target audience: regular cinema-goers.The film takes place in 1977, an era of artistic pornography -- filmmakers truly believed that they could compensate for the low points of X-rated features by adding deep stories and mesmerizing atmosphere. In a way, the film's director -- Paul Thomas Anderson -- implements a very artistic approach to the project, resulting in a gratuitous and artistic movie about a period in American history when smut was indeed both gratuitous and artistic. Anderson's style is so deep, and so distinct, that we soon feel as if we are reliving the era first-hand. Not a moment goes by where we are unconvinced of the time range dealt with in the film.All was not happy on the set of 'Boogie Nights'. Prior to filming, Anderson approached Reynolds repeatedly, asking him many separate times to play the role of Horner. Eventually, Reynolds agreed, but claimed that the film was horrible and the worst role of his career, publicly disowning it, before being nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Academy Award and suddenly shutting up. A year before, Anderson had suffered title disputes over Sydney/Hard Eight. He preferred the latter title for his film, and New Line Cinema thought the former was more marketable. He essentially lost the battle, and Anderson wisely avoided title disputes this time around by inserting the words \"boogie nights\" into his movie through the mouth of a character.The casting of the film is one of its finest aspects. The Paul Thomas Anderson regulars are here, as well as a whole top-notch cast of first-timers. To name some of the more well-known stars: John C. Reilly, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Luis Guzman, William H. Macy, Heather Graham and Julianne Moore. But the entire movie essentially borders down to Mark Wahlberg, as Eddie, who is surprisingly convincing in his role. Wahlberg, previously known for his singing career and disappointing Hollywood pursuits, has all the necessary traits to portray such a character. This is his best role to date.Anderson knows how to captivate his audience and take complete control of every scene. When Jack Horner first meets Eddie, Anderson slyly uses stars in the backdrop, a sign of things to come, and hidden symbolism as finely acute as it can be. The opening scene is three minutes, a long tracking shot that follows Jack and Amber into a night club, where most of the characters are first introduced. It reminds me of the discussions regarding tracking shots in Robert Altman's 'The Player' -- it works so brilliantly in Boogie Nights, and is the first indication that Anderson knows what he is doing behind the camera. His style is fast-paced in the vein of Martin Scorsese, where shots zip around quite quickly but never seem rushed. Incidentally, Anderson references two classic Scorsese shots -- the closing De Niro mirror speech from 'Raging Bull' and the tracking nightclub scene from 'GoodFellas'. Anderson is a young, growing director who is remarkably mature in story and direction, despite his age. Whereas his first feature film, 'Hard Eight', was noticeably wise and poignant, 'Boogie Nights' is even more so.'Boogie Nights' began as an effort of love on Paul Thomas Anderson's account. Having filmed the extraordinary Hard Eight in 1996, Anderson's film is pragmatic to such an extreme that it almost seems genuine. Boogie Nights invigorates us with its gratuitous content, occasionally bordering on the verge of pornography, only it is far more sophisticated than such trash. It is a blazing, wonderful modern-day masterpiece that is as mind-numbingly explicit as it is wild and stylish. Arguably Anderson's best film and among the greatest -- and most important -- projects of the last decade.",

Every time I expected some interesting new twist to happen, they went back to the original theme.  Once again I compare: the scene in Pulp Fiction, with Travolta and Jackson and the 3 rip-off kids, with the scene in Boogie Nights where they try to deal the fake drugs.  In Pulp, it has a point.  It adds to the story.  The Boogie Nights scene is interesting, but is really unrelated to the rest of the film.  The whole movie can be described like this - every scene is a mini-movie that does not necessarily have anything to do with the big movie.As far as sex, I'm actually impressed that a movie about pornography had this little sex.

Just as Tarantino gave John Travolta's career a kick, P.T. Anderson has given Burt Reynolds the kick that his career needs. Boogie Nights will also undoubtedly make stars of Don Cheadle, Heather Graham, and John Reilly. Overall, a wonderful film. The best since Pulp Fiction. Maybe even better.",

            "content": "Sometime ago I watched a video of Paul Thomas Anderson in which he express the big interest that he has in porn films and how this industry could've produce better films and in consequence a complete genre and not just sex in video tape. Paul Thomas Anderson put his own believes of porn industry in the character played in a terrific way by Burt Reynolds. His name is Jack Horner, a director whose biggest dream is to make a \"real\" film that can keep the viewer in suspense because of the great dramatic story and, at the same time, exciting with the beauty\u0085 and with the \"big cocks and tits\". Soon as he meets Eddie Adams (Mark Walhberg), he believes that he has found the new star for his films. And that's how the story of the young Eddie in the porn industry begins.The film begins with a sequence inside a night club where we can see all the persons that will be part of Eddie's life and later we can see them outside the porn industry, living their daily routine. But soon we can see them inside the porn industry and after only one party, the story of the new Eddie begins, the story of Dirk Diggler. All of them will taste the real success with Dirk as the main star, winning lots of prizes and helping Jack to make real his biggest dream with a series of films about Brock Landers, the new character of Dirk. This sort of exploitation films are an amazing success and for Jack are his firsts \"real\" films. But here is the beginning of the end and the beginning of the \"horrible 80's\" when there is going to be $ex, DRUGS and Rock & Roll for Dirk and pals. But we all know that the excesses can destroy any person and the erectile dysfunction can destroy any porn star and here the film focuses in their lives after the total success and how everybody is having a real bad time with many problems due to society's bad look to porn industry and to a period with many excesses. In Dirk's decadence, after trying and failing in the music industry, there's a brilliant sequence that can resume in a perfect way how the things are going for Dirk and his friends. That sequence is the one of his first drug deal, with the appearance of Alfred Molina, which ends in a total mess. Is funny for us and a terrible experience for Dirk and pals but there's always a solution if you get back in what you know and when Dirk is back, Brock is back.Well I haven't mention most of the characters in my sort of a summary but I must say that all are amazingly well developed. The cast is just superb with the best performance that I have seen of Mark Walhberg. Julianne Moore has a powerful performance in a really moving character; Reilly, Macy, Hoffman, Heather Graham, Guzman, etc are just memorable, all of their characters with funny and sad moments.Finally, I really love the amazing cinematic style of Anderson here with a unique view to the porn industry of the late 70's and early 80's. I used to say that \"Magnolia\" was my favourite of Anderson but right now, after watching all except \"Sidney\", I can't say that I have a favourite because I love them all!PS: somewhere I read that this film is the \"Scorsese film\" of Anderson so I'm more than sure that if you love \"Goodfellas\" and \"Casino\" you will love this one too. I f*cking love \"Boogie Nights\"!",

            "content": "The late 70s and 80s were seen as a Golden Age of the Pornography Industry in America, based San Fernando Valley. This was a period known for pornographers attempting tell a story in their films. With his first major film Paul Thomas Anderson uses this period as a backdrop for his wonderfully told drama.Eddie (Mark Wahlberg) was a 17-year-old high school dropout, working as a dishwasher at a small nightclub. Eddie is spotted by Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds) who hears that the kid was well endowed. After Eddie was kicked out his home by his mother Jack and his partner Amber Waves (Julianne Moore) takes Eddie under their collective wing. Eddie quickly makes friends with porn actors Reed Rothchild (John C. Reilly) and Rollergirl (Heather Graham). Jack convinces Eddie to become a porn actor himself. Eddie renames himself Dirk Digger and he quickly becomes one of the biggest name porn stars around. Eddie/Dirk believes in Jack ideal of telling a proper story in his porn films. But fame is a fickle thing with the porn industry changing and Eddie/Dirk's own person problems pushing him back.Anderson shows his talent as a director early on in the film with an amazing opening sequence with was a 3 minute long continuous shot. He expertly handles the drama, showing both a colourful party side to the late 70s/early 80s to more darker elements which was bound to happen considering it's plot. Anderson perfectly treads a fine line between comedy and tragedy. Anderson mixes in a lot of style to his film with some well handed shots, excellent cinematography and some stylist camera tricks. There was an strong influence from Martin Scorsese behind this film. The plot does have a similar to films like Scarface and Goodfellas where the protagonist starts from a low point to getting fame, money and power to them losing it because of their own arrogance. Boogie Nights is also shot in a similar style to those two films and the ending was a little like Raging Bull, but Anderson's skill made it seem more like a homage then directly coping those films. Anderson mixes in a few themes into his film: one being an very unorthodox way to fulfil the American Dream and use what ever asset you have available to you. They is of course an in-depth look into the plot industry with Anderson showing that whilst some actors may have a tough or unusual background they were willing and happy within the industry and Jack is made out to be a more noble type of director, wanting to at least tell a story in his films. There is also a darker look into why people get involved and the world of excess that inhabited this world but Anderson was darning to show some sort of a positive spin. Anderson also tackles how the porn industry changed in this period and became more of horrid mass produced product.There is a great cast in this film. Wahlberg, Reilly, Reynolds, Moore, Graham, Philip Seymour Hoffman, William H. Macy and Robert Ridgely, all offer good performances. Wahlberg is of course very good in the lead role and his character grows and changes throughout the film and showed the emerging talent he was about to become. Boogie Nights was easily Reynolds and Graham's best film, showing the two are good actors, showing their dark side in the process. Moore and Reynolds were very believable in the mentor role of the film and that Moore's character was filled with heartbreak and tragedy. There were simple, powerful scenes in the film involving some of the characters, such as between Reynolds and Ridgely in prison, a wonderfully handled scene and a small scene with Hoffman crying in his car, a bitter, raw scene that was very real. Hoffman is one of the best character actors in Hollywood.An excellent film that shows American film-making at its best.",

So detailed, yet so entertaining and easy to follow. The story deals with a young man named Eddie Adams, who has aspirations of greatness. Sadly, Eddie has minimal abilities at best. He is not very bright and makes a living washing cars and bussing tables. Ahh, but he does have one great attribute (try to guess what it is). He will use his one gift to climb the ladder of success very quickly. The only problem is that Eddie or Dirk Diggler (his new porn name) does not have the maturity or life experiences to handle so much at such a young age. The downfall is inevitable. Anderson shows you the meteoric, positive rise, then the depressing, sad fall of the Adult Entertainment Industry's \"biggest\" star.This film features the talents of so many great actors. Each is given an in-depth character to play. In a way, the wacky characters help form an extended family, that is very supportive, at first. The music is brilliantly worked into the story. The creative camera tricks and angles are evident from start to finish. Guaranteed that you will discover new things every time you see the film.

            "content": "Although a film like Boogie Nights about the pornography industry could easily have been far more crass and exploitive, what we have here is a decent and sensitive study of a group of people in a field who create and form their own community because of the way society frowns on what they do.The negative side of the freewheeling hedonistic lifestyle is also shown, even the best of these people are far from saints. Boogie Nights covers their lives from a day in the mid seventies when Burt Reynolds interviews Mark Wahlberg, a young busboy with an amazing gift below decks, and asks him to be a star in his new porn film.It's too bad that Burt Reynolds did not win the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. He's certainly a man of great pretensions about his work. Also in that same character package is an easy going man who just wants to live and let live, a compassionate human being who's like a father figure to the younger members of his group. It really is Burt Reynolds's finest screen moment.Mark Wahlberg as young Eddie Adams who becomes Dirk Diggler got his breakout part in this film. Of all the characters, he's the one whose background we see. His mother just puts him down, he'll never be anything more than the white trash he comes from. Seeing how she treats him we don't question why he gravitates to Reynolds and his crowd. I'm sure it's the same for all viewers of Boogie Nights, we realize that all who are in that crowd are in some way people who've been wounded and have banded together to do their thing and live life as they want to, and the devil with the consequences.Julianna Margulies realizes the consequences full well. Her pathetic fight for her child's custody is very poignant, made more so by the fact that the audience is saying while we like her character of Amber Waves, her expectations about custody are nothing short of pathetic.My favorite in the film however is Philip Seymour Hoffman at the start of his career as the lovestruck gay kid, Scotty Jay who is completely enamored of Wahlberg. For those who saw him as Truman Capote, this other gay character will be quite an eyeopener. Also Alfred Molina has a brief, but telling part as the rich party boy whose coked up character you will not forget. Boogie Nights follows a group of a dozen or so people from the mid seventies to the mid eighties, just before AIDS came full blown on the scene with consequences for a lot of the Boogie Nights type characters. Still this group is mostly survivors and we like that about them.And it's why we like Boogie Nights.",

Boogie Nights didn't make a huge initial splash, and I still don't think it's received the credit it deserves. The immediate clamor surrounding the film (\"Some porn movie with Marky Mark\") was wholly without merit. What Paul Thomas Anderson has created is no less than a stunning representation of the pursuit and subsequent loss of the American Dream (if such a thing still exists).For those of you who have been living in a box (or a confessional) for the past 8 years, Boogie Nights tells the literal rise-and-fall tale of young Eddie Adams (Wahlberg). Eddie is just a dopey kid from Torrance, California who wants something more out of life. His room is soaked in muscle-bound, naive Americana. His dreams are far bigger than his potential, but not quite as large as his...special gift. His bald-headed southern gent quickly raises the attention and eyebrows of the booming, omni-present adult film industry. Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds as the film's twinkle-eyed Papa Bear) gets wind of Eddie's hidden talent and decides to put him in a movie.Before you can say \"deep-throat,\" Eddie has changed his name to Dirk Diggler and exposed his massive member to a wide-eyed public. Fame and fortune make Dirk's acquaintance, as do a bevy of local porn celebs. His friends and co-workers become his makeshift family, but it soon proves to be a Sunday picnic like no other. As the feel-good 70s give way to the coke-addled, video-friendly 80s, Dirk & Co. begin a dangerous backslide. Anderson put everything he had into this glorious, moving epic. It sizzles and never fizzles. Nary a frame of this monumental picture is wasted, and the characters and their dialogue live with us long after ELO fades from the soundtrack. See this one immediately. And then watch it again.And again.",

And then follows his down-fall, his relations with his friends/colleagues after his star-dom becomes a subject of the past.'Boogie Nights' is a fantastic film, mainly because you enter a world where each character has something in store for themselves. The Porn Film Industry, it's ambitions and it's way of a profession is wonderfully executed. Thanks to the brilliant screenplay and flawless direction by Paul Thomas Anderson. It's one of those rare films, that have a superb start, middle and end. Without a doubt, He's one of the most talented film personalities in Hollywood today. Robert Elswit's Cinematography is top-notch. Dylan Tichenor's editing is perfect. In the acting department, Burt Reynolds is outstanding as the legendary Porn Filmmaker. The veteran gets a role of a lifetime, and he completely sinks his teeth into it. Julianne Moore is excellent. She delivers her careers most believable performance to date. Mark Wahlberg, despite being the protagonist, hardly steals the show. He's just about decent. William H. Macy sports a hilarious hair-do, but performers seriously. Heather Graham looks angelic, like always. Her performance is passable. John C. Reilly is super, while Don Cheadle shines. Philip Seymour Hoffman is brilliant as a homo-sexual. Thomas Jane is effective. Alfred Molina stands out in a cameo appearance. Melora Walters is hardly there.On the whole, 'Boogie Nights' is a must watch!

But there is a difference between just entertainment and actual substance, and Anderson blends the two together in a very unpretentious way. His films are in a way understandable, not confusing, but they are unpredictable and also have a certain element to them. It's really not easy to pinpoint. However, Boogie nights does not disappoint.The screenplay is fantastic, and in a way it has a tone of comedy/drama that is found in films like Goodfellas and Pulp Fiction. The ensemble cast is fantastic, the look is fantastic, the direction is fantastic. The characters are also very sympathetic, characters that are fully fleshed-out. Mark Wahlberg is excellent in the lead role, probably the best I have ever seen of him. I found this film to be overall more satisfying than Magnolia, and also has some similarities to many great character-studies, also Anderson's There Will Be Blood at times in it's narrative. I really don't have much to say about the film. Some more viewings are in store, but as of now this is fantastic film, a real gem, maybe even masterful.

            "content": "Writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson's paean to the porno industry of the 1970s is sadly cynical, artistically cathartic, and moderately exhausting. Mark Wahlberg is very good as a disaffected, well-endowed busboy named Eddie who is recruited by an adult filmmaker to appear in skin flicks, eventually becoming the celebrated Dirk Diggler. Burt Reynolds (in a comeback performance) plays his movie-making mentor, and Julianne Moore is a sex starlet who evolves into a mother-figure. Anderson is a great visual talent, and his film is ambitious and audacious, but his attention-span is minimal (he can't seem to get a grip on the continuity, nor is he able to make the general prurience palatable through either sheer talent or chutzpah). As an actor's director, Anderson could also use some focus. He works a near-miracle with Reynolds, who received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor, but he doesn't get anything special out of the normally exciting Moore (she's tough to pin down here: gritty yet alluring, she puts out so much sweetly-nuanced artifice that you're not sure there's a person underneath). Don Cheadle as Buck Swope is another problem: too cool for this school, Cheadle has a hard stoniness and aloofness that keeps us distant from him at all times. At this point in his career, Wahlberg is inexperienced, yet it's not overly-obvious; he's handled in a young-dumb way that is never caricatured by Anderson (this kid Diggler is nobody's na\u00efve hick, and all that wide-eyed stuff is thankfully passed over). There are pedantic pit-stops in the road that slow the film down to a crawl, and yet Robert Elswit's head-swimming cinematography is endlessly interesting (almost hallucinogenic). Is the picture a masterpiece? Some seem to think so, but I found Anderson far too enamored of his own ambiance. The characters themselves are interesting enough to make this world of porno-makers bracing to us--and the bitter, skeptical finish is darkly-comic instead of bold or 'shocking'--but \"Boogie Nights\" isn't the shattering personal experience many critics hailed it as. Then again, maybe that's just hype and that Anderson had no intention of hitting some people's nerves so hard. **1/2 from ****",

The movie involves a bunch of misfits, each with serious problems, past and present. However, in a way, these misfits are able to come together as a happy family, in the porn business. Not to say that their lives are perfect, but they are much improved. The star misfit is one Dirk Diggler. Dirk has a natural feature that makes him a porn legend. However, as Dirk rises up the ranks of stardom, he and his happy family of misfits start to fall apart. In a sense, the characters start to forget what made them happy and get trapped in the pursuit of money and drugs. What I liked so much about this film are the creative tactics and methods used by Anderson. There are so many underlying themes going on here, that you will pick up new things as you watch it. Moreover, the characters are incredibly well developed. I have trouble describing this film, because it is just too overwhelming, trying to describe all of the many great things in it. No scenes are wasted and many creative twists are happening all the time.This film is a must see for all fans of film. How Anderson and this film were denied an Academy is beyond me. However, certainly the adult themes of the film did not help it with some. That is unfortunate, because there are some very positive themes in the film. This film is not for children, but at the same time it is not a \"porn film.\" I believe that has been the biggest misconception.

BOOGIE NIGHTS is Anderson's self-scripted chronicle narrative of a young porn star Dirk Diggler's up-and-down in 1970s and 1980s and concurrently it depicts a vivid milieu of the entire pornographic ventures. The multi-linear structure is a great bliss of his genius, of course the apex would arrive belatedly in MAGNOLIA. Also well-received is Anderson's laborious long- shots (notably the beginning shot and the swimming pool party shot) do wonders to meet and eyes and synopsize various characters into a neat yet comprehensive introduction. A stellar cast which generated two Oscar nomination for then-veteran Reynolds and now- veteran Moore, which out of my preference, Moore should have won her golden man for her first nomination (over Kim Basinger) and Reynolds' nomination is more like a career recognition for his 35-years-long devotion in the show business. And Mark Wahlberg's nominal main character is sidelined but still it's his best work so far. Don Cheadle, Heather Graham (the unforgettable roller-girl) and William H. Macy (a short but dynamic presence also for Thomas Jane and Alfred Molina) are also among the stand-outs in the film. The film holds firmly within its epic length, 155 minutes, until the curtain call arrives in a final showdown, which is phony, but the amazing integrity of the pace and the quirky but fun- studded sway of the film assure me that Paul Thomas Anderson might go much further than Quentin Tarantino in his brighter pathway as a screenwriter and director.",

So far as that issue, there's nothing new here.What we have here is a major talent who is still a juvenile. He understands how to write a scene that has meat for actors. He understands how to choose great actors, and some of the greatest actors around are here. He knows how to trust the spirit of the actor, and how to let them collaborate -- so often those with fire can shine. For instance Burt Reynolds fills his cup, but he does all the pouring.The good news:--the actors are on fire--some scenes are exceptionally well written--he's not afraid to use the camera in advanced waysBut each of these has qualifications, which are less obvious in the later film than here. But here the deficiencies really detract, and make this rather a disappointment given the sheer talent involved.He trusts actors. He apparently understands acting. But some actors, even the national treasure Ms. Moore need commands, need a larger vision. She's good here, but see what she really can do in `Vanya,' when she's pushed. Hoffman is lost here, reduced to superficial emotions. See what Mamet can do with him in `State and Main' where multidimensional resonances are evoked.He can write a good scene. And some of these ARE good. But he grows the film from the actors. They have interactions and those modulate into scenes. The bigger the view, the less control he has. A real writer, one who can write great films, also starts from the big picture. The big picture here is merely accidental. He needs meditation to balance his attention disorder.He does some interesting camerawork. But every clever shot is a copy of work elsewhere. And they lack dramatic power. For instance, the long tracking shot in the beginning, does really touch a lot of bases, but each touch is light. Compare that to the opener of `The Player,' where the shot is more than merely impressive, it means something, the scenelets have dramatic import. He has the motions down, but not the eye for power yet.I went through the director's commentary on the DVD. How depressingly inarticulate this kid is. He's clearly talented -- he's got some moxie -- but he needs an intelligent mentor and the patience to listen.",

            "content": "'Boogie Nights' takes an in-depth look at the 70's porn industry and how it transformed into the 80s. It is shot like a docudrama and follows the characters throughout their years with the industry. Paul Thomas Anderson is one of the brightest filmmakers today and not only does he cleverly merge humour, drama and suspense but what really stands out is the no-nonsense treatment. It's brutally (and appealingly) in your face. Given the running time, 'Boogie Nights' is fast paced and yet it doesn't look one bit rushed.Anderson uses flashy colours through lighting, costumes and set designs and the soundtrack to capture the essence of the 1970s and 1980s. The transformation in time and flamboyant fashion throughout the two decades is shown with sheer fluidity. Elswit's cinematography is absolutely splendid especially the long shot at the New Year's party sequence.Needless to say, Paul Thomas Anderson is a gifted writer. Not only does he show an impressive understanding of the 70's wildness but he has his own unique way of telling the story, showing it through the viewpoints of different characters. The characters are brilliantly written and the dialogues are cleverly ridden with wit, humour and sarcasm.Mark Wahlberg delivers his finest performance to date as he balances the innocence, wildness and despair of Dirk Diggler. Burt Reynolds is first rate as he delivers a restrained yet strong performance as director Jack Horner who cares deeply for his employees and his 'art'. Julianne Moore is superb as the pornstar 'mother' while Heather Graham and William H. Macy are amazing as Rollergirl and Little Bill respectively. Don Cheadle, Melora Walters, John C. Reilly, Thomas Jane, Luis Guzm\u00e1n, Alfred Molina and Philip Seymour Hoffman are remarkable in their supporting roles. The cast also includes real pornstars like Veronica Hart and Nina Hartley.With 'Boogie Nights' Paul Thomas Anderson has created another unique film. One that is funny, intriguing, tragic, brutal and honest. One that shows the change of the unstable lifestyle from the 70s to the comparatively tamer life of the 80s. The multidimensional characters are very well defined and played with elan by the actors. But overall, 'Boogie Nights' is an example of first class film-making.",

Somehow this manages uses the world of porn film-making to examine families, American politics in the 70s and 80s and all sorts of serious themes while also being a flat out blast to watch. It was criticized a bit on release for plagiarizing Scorsese, especially 'Goodfellas', but to me this is homage in the best sense. Taking great work done by others and building on it to create something new. Indeed, the excitement I had on first seeing it reminded me of my first falling in love with Scorsese's kinetic work as a young film fan many years ago.",

            "content": "Paul Thomas Anderson has only made a moderate amount of movies, but each one of them that I've seen has had a common effect on me. I couldn't wait to watch them again, after they were over.\u00a0My first impression of Boogie Nights was that it started off fairly slowly. For the first hour or so of the movie, I was under the impression that it was going to be the first PTA film that I didn't absolutely love. And then, a few absolutely fantastic scenes turned my opinion right around. I was so impressed, that I immediately watched the entire 155 minute film again. There are very few movies that I've had that reaction to, but in this case it was both pleasurable and enlightening. I still think that the second half of Boogie Nights is the stronger part, but the first half is also very good. This is a great example of a fantastic writer being paired with a dream cast.\u00a0The main characters are all expertly written and acted, and that's to be expected. Mark Wahlberg, Julianne Moore, and Thomas Jane all gave the best performances of their careers here, in my opinion. But even the minor characters get powerful moments that stick in your mind after the movie is over. Actors like Don Cheadle, Alfred Molina, Philip Seymour Hoffman, and William H. Macy didn't have nearly the screen time of Mark Wahlberg or Burt Reynolds, but they were just as instrumental in making Boogie Nights as good as it is. Nearly every character is given an opportunity to make an emotional connection with the viewer, and that's astounding.\u00a0As far as I'm concerned, this movie was overflowing with iconic performances, and there are two or three scenes that are easily some of the best I've ever seen in ANYTHING. Anderson is undeniably gifted at both writing, directing, and choosing the right music to enhance his work. I don't know if I like Boogie Nights quite as much as There Will Be Blood or Punch Drunk Love, but it really says something when a movie that's longer than average, never drags for a moment and leaves me wanting more. It benefits greatly from multiple viewings, and I'm sure my fondness of the movie will only grow.",

No not that type of voyeurism you dirty lot , I was simply curious to see what someone has to do to break into the world of pornography . You might like to know that an infamous British tabloid used to advertise for what's euphemistically known as \" Video models \" in its classified column . I had a rough idea what this involved but there was no way I was going to apply but that didn't stop me from wondering why anyone would want to get caught up in this business and after seeing BOOGIE NIGHTS I now know that it's for sad unhappy people desperate to make money This is a sad , haunting , compelling film . Eddie Adams a hustler of sorts works as a dish washer where he has a chance meeting with porn director Jack Horner who eventually makes him a porn star and the film charts the rise and fall of Horner's porn company from the late 70s to early 80s . It's character driven so Anderson has to make his characters sympathetic and memorable . We see the weak willed Little Bill who wife taunts him by having sex with strangers , Buck Swope whose main ambition in life is to open his own hi fi store , Amber Waves who has a drug problem and trouble getting access to her children etc . You certainly may dislike what these characters do but you'll find them gaining your sympathy rather than your hatred due to their sad damaged lives . Being a porn star might sound attractive on the surface , especially before AIDS came along , but it's a career that leads to self destruction Anderson has written a very good script but that's not much use if he can't get the best out of his cast but he succeeds . He has cast very reliable character actors like Julianne Moore , William H Macy , Luis Guzman and John C Reilly who as you can imagine do their best with the script but casting Mark Wahlberg and Burt Reynolds as the two key characters Eddie and Jack seems like professional suicide and amazingly they're both outstanding . I don't think I've seen Reynolds ever give a better performance than the one here and if you just know him via crap like STRIPTEASE prepare to be blown away Obviously this isn't a film to watch with your parents or even with a bunch of friends on a night in . It's not often that Hollywood produces such an intelligent film and it's a pity that BOOGIE NIGHTS seems to have been a victim of poor timing where it was released in between LA CONFIDENTIAL and TITANIC ensuring that it missed out on more critical acclaim and awards . It did pick up three Oscar nominations but it deserved so much more . Perhaps the Academy didn't want to spoil the 27 year old Anderson with too many nominations at such a tender age ?",

Anderson spins a wonderfully quirky and engaging tale centred around a porn producer, his actors and crew set in the 1970s. Part of the attraction to the movie is the novelty of the subject matter, which then makes for some quite funny sub-plots.Some great drama too, as you see that these are just everyday people, working in an unusual industry.Great performances all round by a cast that, in hindsight, was an all-star one.

Anderson with his camera is like a little boy who just got the toy he wanted more than anything else for Christmas, and he goes wild with it. It swirls around actors in ridiculously long takes, follows them on to the dance floor as they do the hustle, catches elaborately choreographed segments in single shots. The camera gives the sense of never wanting to be left behind by the action, and at one point even plunges under water in a swimming pool to follow one of the many extras at a party scene who decides to go for a dip. Anderson wants to do way too much with the movie, and he doesn't know when to quit. He's like a writer so in love with his story that he doesn't want to leave anything out, even when his material becomes redundant. I can't help but feel that a long sequence late in the movie featuring a wild cameo by Alfred Molina should have been left on the cutting room floor, but then another part of me would hate to miss out on this wonderfully bizarre segment. The whole movie is like that. Even when Anderson pushes too far and too hard, you're carried along by his enthusiasm for his own film.Anderson's style is certainly reminiscent of Altman's, but he's not an Altman rip-off. In many ways he's the opposite of Altman; you never feel that Anderson is anything less than in complete control of his movies (and this feeling increases if you watch the documentary of the making of \"Magnolia\") whereas Altman's films seem to come together despite his attempts to instill chaos on his actors. But both share the knack for being able to build a film around a unifying tone rather than any rigidly imposed dramatic structure, and they're both wonderful with actors.And speaking of actors.....\"Boogie Nights\" would be nothing without its astounding ensemble. Burt Reynolds leads the pack in the performance of a career, but he's certainly not alone. Julianne Moore and Don Cheadle are terrific here as usual, but even Heather Graham, whose career has gone nowhere, impresses. John C. Reilly should probably have been directed to tone down the jokiness of his performance, as he strains credibility in every scene he's in, but he's so damn funny that you don't really care. And Mark Wahlberg has proved himself to be a fine actor, pulling off this difficult role with aplomb. His performance here coupled with his performance in \"I Heart Huckabees\" convinces me that he may be one of the most promising young actors in circulation. Who ever would have thought that? \"Boogie Nights\" may be a step or two shy of greatness, but I dare you to watch this movie and not have a great time. Groove on, man.Grade: A",

If only he had been encouraged to perform in this more low key and controlled way more often. Others are encouraged to be more demonstrative and Philip Seymour Hoffman's performance as the besotted youngster is a little embarrassing but so believable in this mixed up and crazy world. Mark Wahlberg has also been known to be a bit sniffy about his part in this but has he surpassed this role, one wonders. Similarly, Anderson extracts from Julianne Moore, surely one of her greatest performances. Overall, the film works, like some dream, rolling from one incident to another, highs and lows all contributing to the creation of the ultimate sex film at a time when so many were made in such a short space of time.

Anderson's choice of near constant music of the times is such an important factor here, another aspect he should be applauded for. This is a tale of the 70's and 80's pornographic film industry that was booming at that point in time. The first half is so enjoyable and sometimes so funny and of course much of it is about sex in some of the oddest ways. The second half follows some of these characters after their heyday in \"film\" with varying degrees of sadness and happiness. Julianne Moore is magnificent. Beautiful, delicate and oh so touching. Burt Reynolds gives his best performance. Philip Seymour Hoffman can break your heart, but there are so many fine performances, big and small. A lot of the film rests on the shoulders of a young Mark Wahlberg barely out of his Marky Mark and Calvin Klein days. His inexperience shows in a demanding rolle, but he ultimately pulls it off.

            "content": "What a bold undertaking to present a film to mainstream audiences showing them a tad of what the pornography industry was about in Southern California in the 70's/80's. This is when Pornography was going...\"mainstream\". This is when those doing these films wanted to prove this genre was more than just sex -- that it was no different than major motion pictures and the actors actually saw themselves this way.I think if a theme like this was done by others, it would have went way off base..some Producers/Directors trying to weed in social commentary or their beliefs -- while others just getting \"down and dirty\" in telling the tale...which would have indeed turned me off from seeing this film.Director Paul Thomas Anderson didn't go either route. He just let you decide what to make of it, all he does is show you the lives of these folks at that time when so many changes were happening to that industry, to the characters and the world around them. You learn that these actors/actresses were regular people, real folks. They hurt, they bleed, they wanted real love and committment, and they wanted to party and be \"famous\".Some had problems, but the idea that \"hookers\" and \"morally bankrupt people\" were all that made up this industry, you see here that's not all true. At this time, that was all being turned around.In \"Boogie Nights\" you view these characters reasons for getting involved in such an industry. The way its done is good. What happens to these characters are good to see as well, how much money and power they get, how it all goes away....all the things they get involved in...and what for? I love the transition from the 70's to the 80's when Video makes this industry grow even more mainstream. The challenges of those who do NOT want to change.\nNot all good things happen to these characters. Southern California -- The Valley -- is known for its adult films NOW. This shows you how all that probably started and how \"stars\" were made out of those who acted in it. It is a closed knit industry, everyone knows everyone else and from what I understand, its hard to \"progress\" from adult films to Hollywood Films/Series but some have done so.I really like the 70's feel of the film, this is one of the only films to date that actually captures late 70's styles, clothes, hair, attitude which made it also fun to watch. The transition into the early 80's was nice too, leaving out one main event that eventually plagued the adult sex industry, but this film wasn't about that. It really stops at a certain time because it only goes through the main character's rise and fall in a very taboo industry. The casting of Burt Reynolds was smart as was sprinkling the movie with real adult film stars. Excellent performances from the leads Mark Walhberg and Julianne Moore and such memorable performances from Luis Guzman, Don Cheatle, Phillip Baker Hall, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Heather Graham, Ricky Jay, John C. Reilly, Robert Ridgley (Just wonderful!), Nicole Ari Parker, and Thomas Jane -- who looks like they just picked him up right from the 70's Male Stud Cosmopolitan Center Fold Spread and threw him in there!Boogie Nights is not for everyone, and its not for those looking to get a cheap \"buzz\" from porno-light. It's a smart film with smart acting and directing that makes it way above the pack for its theme and well worth seeing.",

Paul Thomas Anderson has done some of the best films I have ever seen. I mean the man is a genius. His films are occasionally funny, very dramatic, and at times kind of odd.Boogie nights is one of those films. The film focuses on a high school drop out bartender named Eddie(played fantastically by Mark Whalberg). One night, a porn director named Jack(Played fantastically by Burt Reynolds) offers him a job. At first he doesn't accept it. Thewn the next day he gets to know the cast, and has sex. Then once he gets home his mom freaks out on him. So Eddie runs away. So after that Eddie goes to meet Jack and the cast. You get to know the cast. William H. Macy plays a guy who has been cheated on three times. Don Cheadle plays a guy who is trying to get into a stereo business. John C.Reilly plays an actor on set. Julianne Moore plays an actress that is fighting in a custody battle for her son. Eventually, Eddie comes up with his own porn star name Dirk Diggler. Also, Dirk becomes very famous. Winning many adult film awards including best cock and best actor. But as his career continues, his life begins to fall apart. Once everyone quits the business, their lives fall apart. Their lives are ruined by porn.I love the film's soundtrack. I also love how it shows how ridiculous the porn industry is. I also love how the film has a very happy ending. I still have yet to see Paul Thomas Anderson's Hard eight and Magnolia. Where I have I been for the past couple of years. These are amazing movies. how could this movie not be nominated for best picture? It was amazing.

Boogie Nights has the making to make you feel depressed and then to pick you up and make you feel great about yourself only because you fall in love with some of these characters, end up hating them and loving them again and feeling happy that you know everything at the end is going to be ok.  \nThe performances alone make this a masterpiece.    Burt Reynolds is the come back king here as porn director Jack Horner who takes a shine to Eddie who is a waiter at Jack local club and he sees a piece of gold in Eddie.   Eddie and jack become friends and talk more and before you know it Eddie has become Dirk Diggler and is making porn films with Jack as the director. Before you know it Dirk has become the biggest porn actor in the business with Jack and his crew feeling better than ever that they have found their star.   No one stays at the top forever which is where the story of this goes.    First time I saw it I wasn't to sure about as I had never seen a film like it before.  I watched a couple of times after and just fell in love with it and I think the reason for this I because I love the soundtrack.  Along with goldfields this is the greatest soundtrack in Hollywood history.  By naming the artists on the soundtrack will tell you anything about them because some of the bands I don't even like, like ELO who sing on the end song `Livin Thing' but that is the only tune by them I like but that song works just perfectly as does The Beach Boys `God Only Knows'.I can't think of any other film where the backdrop of the story is Porn. Scenes did surprise especially when Dirk getting is beast of a manhood out at the end (even though I know deep down it's not real) but it still makes you surprised.   There is a great feel to this film and you are wanting to know more about how the characters go on but that's where this feel triumphs when you want more but you don't get more and I love that because sometimes you always don't get what you want.",

            "content": "\"Boogie Nights\" is one of those films which can be classified a multitude of ways. It can easily be viewed as period piece, a character study, or a social commentary, among other things. Anyway you look at it, it proves to be an effective piece of film-making. A key to this success is the performance of Mark Wahlberg. Watching him make the transformation for clean-cut kid Eddie Adams to porn superstar Dirk Diggler is what keeps the audience invested in the story being told. In the first half of the film, when it's the most crucial, Wahlberg is able to maintain such innocence and charisma and yet seems instantly at home in the new decadent world his character finds himself in. These scenes work greatly to the film's advantage because they are played with such earnestness. Seeing Eddie Adams embark on his new career, we might as well be watching Peggy Sawyer (of \"42nd Street\") being told she's headed to Broadway. The whole thing just feels so unexpectedly clean, which in turn may be something of a setup for the much darker moments to come.Admittedly, the rise (in the late 70s) and fall (in the early 80s) of the pornography industry is an area of history we don't learn about in school. But it is a legitimate topic of interest, nonetheless. While it certainly contains humor and a plethora of colorful characters, \"Boogie Nights\" takes itself seriously. Aside from sex as a business, issues such as race relations, homophobia, and drug abuse, prove vital to the story it is telling. Another overriding theme of the film is the classic notion of fame as a double-edged sword. One heart wrenching plot line involves a porn actress, gently portrayed by the always wonderful Julianne Moore, who is engaged in a custody battle with her estranged husband over their children. The irony here is that throughout the film we have seen how naturally she mothers those around her, and yet she is ultimately deemed unfit to be a mother to her own children. I'm not saying that decision is wrong, but it isn't easy to watch as she's forced to accept it either. If in fact porn can ever be inspiring, it is something of an inspiration to see the concern the filmmakers within this film put upon themselves for producing a product they can be proud of. They strive to create movies their audiences will appreciate for reasons beyond the sex. We witness their creative process behind James Bond's porno counterpart, Brock Landers, from brainstorming through production. We see the adult industry's equivalent of the Academy Awards ceremony. It is only when we remind ourselves that these people are pornographers does any of this seem the least bit perverse. I strongly feel that this film is in no way trying to glamorize porn. (The ultimate fates of some of its characters are proof enough of that.) I do, however, feel that sometimes we are too quick to demonize based on preconceived notions. The characters we meet here are all consenting adults, engaged in a lucrative business. True, they are flirting with a myriad of dangers. But this film does them a great justice. It allows us to understand the psychology at work behind the choices they make. And it does us a justice too. It lets us choose whether or not we condemn them for it.",

It is a fully realized and brilliant film. What I admire most about Anderson's vision is the scope. He has created a fully constructed world and placed well rounded and interesting characters to inhabit it. The dialogue has spunk and bite and the picture is perfectly casted.Sex is hard to make a picture about, pure and simple. What makes 'Boogie Nights' a masterpiece in my opinion is that it portrays sex in such a blunt way. Whatever sense of spiritualism and individuality achieved through sex is completely gone from these characters. They merely go through the motions. If I had to choose a central motif of what Anderson tries to convey in this picture it would be the dehumanization of sex. Julianne Moore, who gives the finest performance of her career as Amber Waves, has a brilliant moment in the film when she first experiences 'penetration' with 'Dirk Diggler'. She asks Wahlberg's character to come inside her. I'm actually somewhat taken back from having to write this down but this is the crucial moment of the film. There is a line between bodily fluids and seed and 'Boogie Nights' plays with that line, debates it.One thing about 'Boogie Nights' though is that it doesn't damn the porno industry, nor should it. The Burt Reynolds character Jack Horner is brilliantly written and has clearly understandable motives. He views himself as an artist and why shouldn't he? One person's porn is another person's art. There is some sympathy to be felt when Horner's craft becomes nothing more than home videos. To go from the glory of celluloid to fuzzy home video is a long fall. Horner is in his own delusional world and is brought out in an extremely well crafted scene. Horner says that he will find the next adult film star on video tape. The scene leads to a rape of the adult film star 'Rollergirl' on fuzzy scratchy tape. It isn't art and it isn't 'sexy'.'Diggler' is nothing more than a stupid prop in these porn films. He didn't get to where he was with his acting skills. He has one thing in the world and it really is fascinating how Paul Thomas Anderson creates a character around that notion. 'Diggler' has to be a thoughtless tank for the picture to work. He has to have the base animal instincts of what sex is. It makes the picture all the more tragic for 'Diggler' to truly grasp even the slightest bits of maturity through whoring himself out. 'Diggler' is forced to go through hell. Anderson is blatant in his subtleties about what plaque 'Diggler' and his sex life. The character isn't really complete until the moment when he is paid next to nothing to jack off in a car. In many ways 'Boogie Nights' is a tragic film but I think it's more than that. It has an extremely satisfying conclusion where 'Diggler' questions his existence and his role in life better than almost any cinematic character that preceded him.",

If this sounds like Quentin Tarantino (albeit half a decade later), it's not meant to. \"Boogie Nights\" isn't as strong of a film as \"Resevoir Dogs,\" but it's close.Calling Anderson's film a Hollywood story isn't really truthful (the film revolves around the pornography business), but it follows a more-or-less similar plot trajectory to any \"rise and fall of a star in showbusiness.\" In this case, the film revolves around Eddie Adams, a seventeen year old who is spotted by hotshot porn director Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds). After agreeing to \"act\" in one of Jack's films, Eddie, now known as Dirk Diggler, becomes an instant sensation and becomes king of the porn film industry. But with every rise there is a fall, and it's usually much harder than the rise to stardom.Actually, \"Boogie Nights\" is more than a biography. It's about a group of friends and coworkers who work together making pornographic films. Dirk is clearly the center of the film, but the other characters are not forgotten. The other characters are given due attention to their own little dramas. This is the film's biggest problem; there's way too much of it, and it causes the film to drag. In fact, many of these characters could have been written out entirely.The acting is outstanding all around. Mark Wahlberg is not an actor with a broad range. But even though he had to wait nine more years for an Oscar nomination, this is his best performance. At the beginning, Eddie is innocent and eager to please. But as he becomes Dirk, his ego gets inflated, and drugs start to take hold. Burt Reynolds is brilliant as Jack. For once, the big Hollywood type is not a sleazebag who would throw someone out on the street once they stopped making money. He's a father figure to Dirk, and although in the beginning his world seems brimmed with danger and uncertainty, but Jack's warmth makes it feel homey after a while. The rest of the cast is great as well: special acclaim has to go to Julianne Moore (has she ever given a bad performance?), Don Cheadle, and John C. Reilly.Paul Thomas Anderson is unquestionably a filmmaker, not a movie director. His style and his technique show a much greater skill than something you would see in a given movie at the multiplexes. He has a keen eye for detail (the setting is impeccable), and he makes sure that each shot is perfect. Not everything he does is perfect (the film needed a better editor-many scenes run for too long, and some just don't need to be there), but what is there is very good.",

In this climate of euphoria and emotion,the young Eddie Adams (Mark Wahlberg, excellent), a waiter's assistant, is discovered by the veteran director of porn films, Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds, in the film that saved his career and in which he had one of its more magnificent actings), who decides to transform the boy in a star of the porn movies . Harassed by the mother and marked by the father's indifference, Eddie sees in Jack the paternal figure that he always needed, and it is exactly this relationship that is born among the two. Eddie changes his name and he becomes Dirk Diggler, and he and Jack begin a success escalade that doesn't seem more to have an end, and they dive once and for all in the illusion and in the pleasure that marked the seventies. Eddie fells that he is finally inside a family that, although it is different, it welcomes him and loves him. There is still Amber Waves (Julianne Moore), a star of erotic films and Jack's partner, who seems to works as a maternal figure for everybody, Reed Rotchild (John C. Reilly), an actor not very intelligent, but sensitive and owner of a good heart, Little Bill (William H. Macy), one of the production assistants, who lives in constant tension state thanks to his wife's betrayal, Buck Swope (Don Cheadle), an actor who loves the art of interpreting but who would give everything to set up his own sound equipments' store and Rollergirl (Heather Graham), an actress who refuses to remove her skates of her feet, and who is like the daughter of Jack. And there are more people, united by love and affection, a true family.This first half of \" Boogie Nights \", as funny and solar as the illusion that represents abruptly gives place to a second act. The seventies becomes the eighties, cynic and gloomy and, for the old guard of the porn movies, tragic. It is the decade of the video tapes, that removed of the hands of these film directors at the margin of the cinematographer industry  the pretense of doing films. While Jack Horner and his family begin to sink in the drugs, in the decadence or in the attempt of adapting at the new times, \" Boogie Nights \"  grows and grows more and more sad, violent and per times desperate.. And it is on that second act in which not only Jack, but everybody who is watching the film, understands that the life can be a party, but that it has hour to end... I use to trace a parallel, although a little hypothetical, among the career and the life of the star Burt Reynolds and the ascension and fall days of Dirk Diggler, the character of the film. As well as Dirk, Reynolds reigned supreme in the seventies, and he also began the success escalade, money and women that I mentioned. And like Dirk, he also proved the sensation of being arrested in the deepest of the forgetfulness, and it was at this time in where he showed all his dignity and his lion heart to the greatest comeback in \" Boogie Nights \" to consecrate him again as one of the largest ones (if not the largest...) stars that Hollywood and the world already knew, a man who conquered alone, in every film he made, in every smile he gave, in every glance, the love and the dedication of so many fans who never abandoned him, unlike the way the system of Hollywood did, turning their back to him...\" Boogie Nights \" belongs to Burt Reynolds. If Hollywood abandoned him, Reynolds now came back, and he has something that nor the largest millionaires of the show business will have one day: Burt Reynolds now is part of the history of the movies, and he will always live in our memories as  Jack Horner, a passionate man who loved intensely the life and  the art, a brilliant director and a father for all those who need love. His perfect and magnificent frightening interpretation rescue the Burt Reynolds of the seventies: the charming star, adored by the world, a man who seems to have lived so intensely and adventurously as his characters...\" Boogie Nights \" is a film that needs to be seen and studied. Paul Thomas Anderson seems to be Taxi Driver 's  Martin Scorcese: young, but owner of such an incomparable and impressive talent that he already recorded his name in the largest film directors of the world list, with just this film.    \" Boogie Nights \" is a pretty and touching saga on the seventies, about the human spirit, about the adversities that all we sometimes need to face, but it also leaves still in our hearts a message larger: that nothing achieves to defeat the human spirit. And the merit of this film, the actor that takes it in such a beloved and astonishing strengh, the man who synthesizes everything that \" Boogie Nights \" tries to pass to the people who will watch it, is Burt Reynolds.\" Boogie Nights \" is Burt Reynolds!!! And the end is so sad that is impossible to leave of spilling some tears...",

            "content": "Paul Thomas Anderson's 1997 film \"Boogie Nights\" is a breathtaking ride through seven years in the pornographic film industry. This was a huge undertaking for this filmmaker's sophomore foray into picture making, but as seen with his prior effort, \"Hard Eight\", he has a knack for garnering career-making performances from his actors and for interweaving story lines on par with Robert Altman. He seems also to have no qualms with wearing his influences on his sleeve, as is clear by the often spoken about three minute long opening shot that hearkens back to Scorsese or DePalma.The film follows the journey of a young man, played by the previously under-appreciated Mark Wahlberg, who yearns for a life beyond his Southern California suburban nowhere. Once he meets up with Burt Reynolds, in the finest performance of his career, and his pseudo-family of skin flick makers and performers, the story is just getting revved up. What follows are two and half hours that wiz by with the deft hand of a filmmaker so attuned to the needs of their story that the frequent subplots and meanderings only add texture and aesthetics to the piece. Though it is basically \"42nd Street\" with a porn twist, it's surprisingly subdued in its expression of on-screen sex, because the film is about so much more. Although their business is sex and pleasure, it is the variation on the family unit and the hopes and dreams of the characters that are really at the core.Put simply this is brilliant film-making!",

It's the era when the increasing trend of the entertainment industry was just about to peak, and everything were shiny than ever. As I see it, Boogie Nights is the best adaptation that flashbacks the audience to that decade, even better than \"Munich\" which zooms to another perspective but on the same age.Paul Thomas Anderson is truly a brilliant director/writer considering his other movies, \"There will be blood\" and \"Magnolia\". On Boogie Nights he tries to reveal the insights of adult movie industry with messed up characters having bitter life stories, with a tremendous approach than ever. The actors are so well chosen that I can not imagine this movie without any single one of them, casting made a \"bull's eye\" selection on this one. Mark Wahlberg was great for the role of Dirk Diggler, a confused kid, trying to be somebody in big town, appreciated by others with his gift (?). Especially I loved him at the scene where he just stares on empty space for 50 seconds in Rahad's mansion, giving the summary of the movie and letting audience to feel free to guess what he may be thinking. He is simply great as well as Julianne Moore, a drug-addict porn-star/mother desperately trying to get the custody of her son, Don Cheadle, another star trying to find out ways to get by besides playing in movies, William H. Macy, a recessive husband with a morally disturbed wife, Philip Seymour Hoffman, a poor sound recorder who can not control or express his homosexual urges, John C. Reilly, the long-life partner of Eddie \"Dirk Diggler\", and Heather Graham, the sweet Rollergirl.As for Burt Reynolds, I can not find the exact words to express my thoughts for his acting. He is truly amazing for the \"Jack Horner\" character who is trying to be an art-man in this difficult sector. Jack Horner is the director of adult films in the movie, trying to prove that the industry may grow with the help of directors, as himself, having artistic approaches. He believes and cares for his actors so well that instead of his directing job, he tries to help the characters in their daily messed up lives. While Reynolds gives his full effort on this one, I can not pass the great acting of Alfred Molina, as freaky Rahad Jackson, who was just on the screen for approximately 10 minutes of the whole 156 minutes movie, but he performs a tremendous job as good as Judi Dench in \"Shakespeare in Love\" and deserves at least a nomination for an Academy Award.The songs are so well placed in the movie that besides the art direction; the music you hear will blow your mind and simply take you to those years. I want to congratulate the music supervisors for shaping up the movie just for our taste.It's a real travesty that this picture was only nominated for 3 Oscars in the lousy Oscar year when the 2.5 hours of hollow steel, Titanic, swept most of the awards. Just like \"Shawshank Redemption\", this movie was so unlucky to be released on a year when a major shiny blockbuster manipulated the members of the Academy.I truly recommend it to drama lovers and but also warn parents to keep their youngsters away from this movie, because of too many explicit scenes.My Rate: **** out of ****",

            "content": "Boogie Nights tells the story of Eddie Adams (Mark Wahlberg) and his life in the adult film industry of the 1970s and the 1980s. Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds) discovers Eddie Adams working as a waiter at a club. After partying with Jack Horner and his many friends and associates, including Reed Rothchild (John C. Reilly) whom he befriends and strikes a close relationship with, Eddie Adams decides to go by and stick with the title Dirk Diggler. Dirk Diggler becomes a hit due to his size and charm, and the notoriety and money comes along with it. Not everything is perfect, however, in this colorful and lively landscape, and when things go from bad to worse the story continues to follow everyone from their rise and fall, from their attempts at their ambitions to their dangerous habits. Horner and company find themselves in a world of chaos and confusion, and Dirk Diggler along with Reed Rothchild end up doing no better.Boogie Nights is brilliant and bizarre, frightening and funny, creative and compelling. It's one of the greatest films of the 90s and Paul Thomas Anderson is as talented and as ambitious a filmmaker as Stanley Kubrick. Part of what makes Boogie Nights so brilliant is the cast. There isn't a single performance here that is weak. Everyone is given enough screen time to really digest and express their characters that they play. There is a lot of character development here as the cast is huge. It's simply astounding how much we learn about so many characters. There's a lot going on throughout the film, but we never feel distracted by anything else. Every character has so much depth, so much personality, and so much truth that you almost never really want to leave them. This is the kind of film that could go on for multiple hours and it would never get any less entertaining. From the opening shot of the film we are in this world. We meet nearly all of the main characters in the opening shot of the film, and there isn't a single mannerism that comes across as false. Paul Thomas Anderson isn't trying to strike any sort of personal truth with this film It is simply about a large family who have ambitions and have dreams, but because they have gotten involved in this world and have become a part of this world they have alienated themselves for greater things. We realize these things almost immediately, and the film is about these characters coming to realize these things as well. It's a coming-of-age film that just so happens to take place in the porno film industry. Along the way we get several references to the life and times of porn actor John Holmes. There's a hilarious scene in which Dirk Diggler has a documentary made about his life and we see Dirk say the same words that John Holmes said in an infamous interview that hinted at the fact that Holmes embellished the truth about a lot of aspects of his career. It is absolutely hilarious, and Mark Wahlberg does an outstanding job in the role. We see a lot of these kinds of mannerisms throughout the film from Dirk, and it all rings so true and so sad. Burt Reynolds does an equally brilliant job. I dislike him as an actor, but his work here is full of depth and subtlety. I like how Anderson doesn't judge his characters. If anyone is going to make a film about the porno industry, THIS is the way to do it! If there is anything wrong with the film, it is that Anderson doesn't quite go far enough. I liked this film a lot, but I wanted to LOVE it. Anderson keeps his camera at a distance from all of his characters and all of the events, and while it is an effective technique and it is a strong and effective technique, it also keeps the viewers from being able to get really involved with the world of this film. We, as the audience, are not invited to REALLY sink our teeth into this subject matter. As a result, by the end of the film, you are left feeling a little cold. These aren't the kinds of characters you really want to re-visit. I have the same problem with The Godfather. I think Paul Thomas Anderson was still trying to get used to the technique of filming a large cast. He did eventually perfect the technique with Magnolia, but it's something you have to really get used to if you're going to ENJOY this film. I think it's a great film. I think it's a little overrated. I think that it is, at times, very disturbing and I am baffled that this got away with an R rating while Peter Greenaway's The Cook, the Thief, His Wife, & Her Lover got an NC-17, but nevertheless, it's a great film. It really showcases Anderson's skills and confidence as a director, and, while you may not actually like the film, you will certainly admire it to death.",

            "content": "I saw this film soon after it first came out and I thought it was brilliant - the kind of multi-layered, multi-storied epic film-making that Scorcese would be proud of. Recently, I've come back to it for a rewatch and I've realised it's not that great - certainly not when compared to the director's later efforts, like THERE WILL BE BLOOD.For once, the story and characters are rather inconsequential. Mark Wahlberg is all right as Dirk Diggler, but his character seems to be a focus for dick jokes rather than emotion, and his going off the rails never really convinces. He just doesn't play that interesting a guy and only has one scene that's really powerful(the bit in the truck towards the end). Burt Reynolds plays a one-note role, and the most interesting characters - those acted by Don Cheadle, William H. Macy, Heather Graham - never really get much of a look-in.Sometimes you get the feeling there are too many stories for even the extended running time to cope with. Take Julianne Moore's character, for instance - the problems with her son are only revealed in a couple of brief scenes, but plenty more could have been made of them. Anderson seems more intent on focusing on the grimier side of his era, with incessant drug-taking and sex instead.Don't get me wrong: I'd be a fool not to realise this is above average film-making, with an expert realisation of era and great handling of story lines that cross in and out of each other. But in places it feels somewhat hollow, and towards the end seems to run out of steam completely, becoming too preoccupied with drug business. It's good, but not quite the classic it once seemed to be.",

            "content": "Ostensibly, 'Boogie Nights (1997)' is about finding a family in the most unlikely of places. Really, it's just about a guy with a really big Richard. The characters don't really change, the side-plots have as much substance as the main story and, generally, it sort of feels like a messy music biopic. Of course, it's not centred around music and there's nothing biographical about it (although a couple of its characters are apparently pretty closely based on real-life people), but it has the same semi-aimless vibe as most entries in that genre. The music biopic often falls into the trap of being baggy because it has some sort of obligation to either the 'truth' or to an estate-controlling survivor, but this picture has no such excuse; it's completely fictional, for starters. The 'true story' feel is more than likely intentional and, in some ways, it creates an interesting effect. Still, the story could've been tightened up a bit and a few tangible themes wouldn't have gone amiss, either. Basically, it's a little like 'Magnolia (1999)' without the bizarrely ever-escalating tension or underlying sense of portentous doom. It's just as concerned with coincidence, for example. While it doesn't seem to be 'about' anything in particular, it is intermittently entertaining. It's also not boring and, while never exactly compelling, it's perfectly watchable throughout. It doesn't pass judgement on any of its characters but, in the process, forgets to get you to care about them. However, it is occasionally fairly funny, primarily when it dips into pseudo pastiche. Look, the film's not great but it's not bad, either. It's engaging and enjoyable enough to be worth a watch, but it's too long and baggy to be counted as one of P. T. Anderson's best. 6/10",

            "content": "Boogie nights is not about dancing, it's about the American porn industry in the late seventies/early eighties and the people involved in it. Despite the sexual subject, there's actually very little sex and nudity going on and none of it is particularly arousing or exciting. In this movie, the porn industry is seen as a mix between business and family. This is a ensemble drama with some comedic elements or an ensemble comedy with some dramatic elements. For me it worked more as a comedy with the best moments coming in where the the \"porn\" industry is seen by some artisans as an artistic endeavor (cue bad acting or cheesy concepts in the porn films). It's idealistic, rather misguided and a bit touching but mostly amusing. The dramatic elements come mostly from their \"real\" family ties, adapting to society in the real world and drugs.I thought some scenes were overlong but in retrospect, I see the genius in making the audience cringing or unnerved and without the proper setup it would not have been as effective. There's a very good ensemble cast with the highlight being Julianne Moore who plays the anchoring \"mother\" to the rest while being rather fragile herself. Roller Girl played by Heather Graham in her break-out role was certainly pretty to look at but was a bit over-hyped as she only shows real acting chops near the end (the bedroom with Moore and the car). Mark Wahlberg in the lead was solid and Burt Reynolds as the director/producer was a nice surprise in a dramatic role. What I particularly enjoyed in this film is that it does not focus on just one character and it shows us a particular inside look at something most of us know very little about and that doesn't exist like that anymore. Keep in mind that several people from the real porn industry of that time have come forward to criticize the accuracy. Be that as it may, it's probably one of the only fiction films made on the subject by an A-list director and that's special in itself. The movie does elicit a gamut of emotions though the comedic elements work better than the dramatic elements.Rating: 7.5 out of 10",

            "review_title": "A Modern Gone With The Wind",
            "content": "There are certain taboos a director doesn't dare touch when he wants to become a \"respected filmmaker\". In my opinion, it takes a truly gifted director to incorporate such themes in their work while still keeping widely acknowledged critical credibility. For instance, Stanley Kubrick was a master at this. He touched on subjects as pedophilia, rape, and even the horror genre, and he never lost an ounce of brilliance nor credibility. Coming off his modest, low-key debut Hard Eight, Paul Thomas Anderson made an extremely bold decision on the subject matter of his follow-up: the adult film industry.There is a certain indefinable mastery that seemed to flow through the veins of young directors in the 1970s. Films like The Godfather, Chinatown, and Apocalypse Now had it on rampant display. Anderson is one of the very few modern filmmakers with this mastery within him.Boogie Nights opens with an explosion of color and sound as the camera glides through a bustling street of '70s nightlife with liquid ease. We are introduced to the cast one by one in a nightclub before finally arriving at a young busboy (Wahlberg). Adult film tycoon Jackie Treehorne (Reynolds) spots him and immediately knows he is something special. He is correct, as this busboy is endowed with an enormous \"talent\", if you will. Treehorne takes him under his wing and nurtures him into the biggest thing in the industry (no pun intended).Never before has a modern film encapsulated the spirit, fashion, and sound of the 1970s as well as Boogie Nights. The soundtrack is incessantly infectious, the sets and wardrobe vibrant, and even the cinematography is lush and colorful.The 1980s start off with the bang of a suicide on midnight of January 1st. Thus begins the fall of class and decency (if that's what you want to call it) in the porn industry. I would say that the early half of this decade is nothing but drugs, sex, and debauchery, but those were the '70s. Those were the good times. No, the '80s are filled with violence, serious drug addiction, despair, and the general fall of the mighty.As I have said, Boogie Nights is a fantastic sensory experience. However, its real strengths lie in its characters. It may sound odd to hear Boogie Nights described as an epic, but it really is. In a lot of ways, it's a modern Gone With The Wind. It doesn't make itself big through massive sets and thousands of extras, but through the journey it takes us through with the characters over the span of two decades: the rise, the top, the fall, the bottom, and the triumphant return.And Anderson orchestrates it all with a presence, ease, confidence, and mastery atypical of a director on his second film. The music is perfect. The visuals are perfect. The acting is perfect. The editing is perfect. The writing is perfect. The direction is perfect. Anderson makes his cinematic influences subtle yet apparent, and even his obvious influence Martin Scorsese could not have pulled this film off as impeccably as he.It would have been easy for a filmmaker to turn Boogie Nights into a parody of the pornography industry. After all, it's not exactly held in high regard. But Anderson crafts a loving portrait of these characters, and the audience likes and cares about them just as much as he does. Boogie Nights is a funny, depressing, uplifting, exciting, heartbreaking, and strangely beautiful film. It truly is a masterpiece in every sense of the word.",

Set in the late seventies in \"the Valley\" (across the Santa Monica Mountains from LA) the movie chronicles a small group of people who have found themselves in the business of producing pornographic films; in particular a young man who assumes the stage name of \"Dirk Diggler\" (Marky Mark himself in a surprisingly earnest performance).A high school drop-out busboy at a nearby nightclub (not unlike the set-up for the vastly inferior \"54\") Marky Mark is noticed by an \"Adult\" film producer (Burt Reynolds) for a specific anatomical aberration conducive to a career in pornography.  Leaving an unhappy home situation, he joins the film making family of Reynolds, Julianne Moore, Heather Graham, and Philip Seymour Hoffman, among other actors who have since become \"stars\" in their own right.  (Luis Guzman and Don Cheadle also appear, foreshadowing an appearance together a decade later as the detectives in \"Traffic\").As this group struggles to maintain some sense self amongst their failed lives, false celluloid intimacy and cocaine induced escapism we follow their stories and the (mis)fortunes of their industry.  There is no overwrought preaching (or rationalization of drug use) and the harshness and sadness of their lives is somewhat compelling, and even touching as they try to move on. The hokey dialogue and cheapo sets of the porno films are convincingly reconstructed (or so I can only assume...) and the tawdriness of their lives made transparent without resorting to becoming what it describes (although Miss Graham and Miss Moore are briefly shown \"at work\") or alienating the audience from the people of the story.It is a brilliant piece of film-making, and very well worth a look, not only as the recreation of an era (very well done with music and dancing of the period) but also as a very human story.",

There Will Be Blood was really good but just not as good as most people say for me. The Master was also very well made but was just a tad disappointing considering how much praise it gets by people. THIS however, is more like it. This is one of the best movies I've seen this year. It kind of reminds me of a Tarantino movie; A great, fun story that was extremely entertaining and still found a way to be very intense and unpredictable. The best I've watched in July 2021 for sure. I'll explore some more Paul Thomas Anderson and maybe rewatch There Will Be Blood someday.",

            "content": "The three names that mean the most to this film are Burt Reynolds, Mark Wahlberg, and Julianne Moore. These three deliver the strongest performances, but the entire cast does a wonderful job. The film although about the porn industry does not let itself get out of hand with it's own sexual premise. On the other hand there were many scenes that involved drug use and although important to understanding the characters lifestyle, I think there was some overkill in this department. Paul Thomas Anderson has not done a great deal of directing, but he may have been picked for this film based on his 1988 work \"The Dirk Diggler Story.\" One thing that was brilliantly portrayed is the family like atmosphere between the characters as they work, live, and party together. Although not a typical family they certainly seem to care for each other. The wonderful soundtrack really helps give you a feel for the period during a time when disco was the rage. There are many disco favorites on it and some other wonderful songs as well.The story is about a gifted young man named Eddie Adams (Wahlberg) that gets invited into the porn industry. He changes his name to Dirk Diggler and becomes and adult film star almost overnight. Jack Horner (Reynolds) is the director that takes his films very seriously as he believes his work is more than just pornography, but that they are true art. However Dirk becomes overly dependent on drugs and soon heads down a dangerous road where he stands to loose everything. Although a greater focus is placed on the character Dirk there are subplots for the other characters and their trials in life. You will find yourself wishing for and hoping their situations improve. All-in-all a well done film.",

            "content": "The Following is a review of the P.T. Anderson picture, Boogie Nights.Everyone has one special thing...and, apparently, Mr. Paul Thomas Anderson has found his in both writing and directing. This is a rare piece, which is simply a giant clich\u00e9 with multi-layered originality beneath the surface.It is quite polished in all aspects. The acting is so fun to watch, and the film itself is, on no rare occasion, a good-hearted fictional biopic of a Holmes-inspired porn star, spanning over 6 years from 1977 to 1983. It is fun to watch, and you don't feel guilty for enjoying every second of it. This, I might say, has to be PTA's ONLY film that doesn't attract only one type of crowd...this attracts everybody, and all for the same reasons, and also for the right reasons. You do not go to this wanting to watch the porn they make, you go to see how they do, why they do it and what their take is how its done.In a simple conclusion, there is absolutely nothing wrong with this film. It may not make you cry and it may not make you laugh...but I can guarantee one thing it will do, it will make you care for the characters from the first moment you see them. PTA is a major actors' director, along with his own cameraman, editor, producer and writer. He is, on technical terms, the next Stanley Kubrick. Yes, this film has its flaws, but not one of them is a character flaw. Every character is perfect. and I say that with full knowledge and self-awareness.There's another point, honesty. This film is honest in its entirety: it shows the ups, the downs, the hilarity, the irony and the happiness of life. It goes full-force in the Crime aspect, the Comedy aspect, the Drama aspect, and the Romance aspect. My favorite part of this story, I think, would have to be the four most innocent, good-hearted people in the entire story: Jessie, Buck Swope, Scotty J and Little Bill. I became excited whenever their faces would pop-up on screen.There is something else that PTA does here...he not only makes you care for all the characters, he also makes you like the actors playing them thru careful examination. Now, two of my least-favorite actors are Mark Wahlberg, Julianne Moore and Heather Grahm. Now, in Wahlberg's case, this is the ONLY film I've ever liked him in (literally). This and Magnolia are the only films I liked Julianne Moore in and this is ALSO the only film I ever liked Heather Graham in.This IS a PTA film you only have to watch once, due to it's simplicity. But (according to rare reviews of his other films), for a LITTLE SUM of you, this is PTA's only film you would WANT to watch more than once. I've seen this 9 times, Magnolia 16 times, Punch-Drunk Love 7 times, There Will Be Blood 6 times and Hard Eight 2 times......so that leaves me on one positive note: I can't get enough of this director...and his use of An Original Clich\u00e9...",

            "content": "I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie at first. I expected this movie to be a fun and non-serious one. After all the movie its premise and concept seems at first sight like fun comedy material rather than heavy dramatic stuff. Overall the movie did had a fun and non-serious feeling and atmosphere all over it but the movie is not without good and powerful dramatic moments as well. The movie and its story even take epic proportions at times, especially in the movie its second halve. You can say that this movie really surprised me in a positive about how good it was and it surely surpassed all my expectations.Basically this movie is a great example of good storytelling. It takes its time to set out the lines. Lots of characters are introduced and the movie takes its time to develop every one of them. The first halve of the movie sets up things and it does this in a pretty lighthearted and fun way, with lots of crazy over-the-top, stereotypical characters. Once the second halve kicks in the movie becomes more dramatic and serious. It all works surprisingly powerful and effective. Surprising, since it's obviously in contrast with the first halve of the movie. \"Boogie Nights\" is a well balanced movie that gets heavy and serious but never without its overall fun lighthearted atmosphere. The characters and situations force you to not take this movie serious, no matter how heavy and dramatic it gets. In this case that is not a bad thing, since it all is so extremely well balanced. It's like the one thing helps to make the other better in this movie, instead of working distracting from- or making it not credible.The movie also does a very good job at recreating the feeling, look and atmosphere of the '70's. It does this of course with its clothes, sets and facial hair but also with more subtle things such as its dialog. It all helps to make \"Boogie Nights\" a very style-full looking movie with a creative feeling and atmosphere of its own.It does a good and creative job at keeping the nudity and sex sequences to a minimum, although it of course is impossible to keep out all the nudity and controversy. That is simply impossible, since the movie is about a controversial subject. The movie provides a good refreshing and I think also realistic(?) look into the world of porn in the '70's and '80's, when the video's and cinematic adult movies were new and popular. It however does this in a respectful way without making really any fun of it. It's highly tempting to turn a movie set in the '70's into a satirical comedy of that era. It does make fun of several things, such as the typical '70's television series but the movie never turns into a full satire.The movie is filled with some wonderful and well known actors, who all give a very good performance. Many big names are involved and that says something about the quality of the Oscar nominated script, that obviously inspired and impressed the fine actors involved. Mark Wahlberg shows that he can handle a big and heavy carrying role. He shows his qualities and skills in this movie. Also really great were Burt Reynolds and Julianne Moore, who both were nominated for an Oscar as well. Other fine roles are being portrayed by good and well known actors such as Heather Graham, John C. Reilly, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Don Cheadle, Thomas Jane, Luis Guzm\u00e1n and Alfred Molina. Yes, it certainly is true that there are many and perhaps too many characters in the movie. It tries too follow one or two too many plot lines with as a result that not everything and everyone works out quite well enough. This perhaps is the only flaw in this otherwise great, wonderful, compelling and powerful movie. A fun to watch but yet also wonderful compelling and powerful movie about the rise and fall of a porn star in the '70's/'80's. A movie that takes surprising epic proportions! Certainly among the very best movies of the '90's.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

            "content": "Sometimes the Academy doesn't recognize the potential of some films, or doesn't nominate them because they are controversial or strong. Sometimes they are nominated, but don't win anything (I hope this doesn't happen this year with \"American Beauty\"). This is exactly what happened with \"Boogie Nights\", which was the best film of 1997. The Academy preferred to give the best picture Oscar to \"Titanic\", a purely commercial and hollow film, and other awards to the overrated \"Good Will Hunting\" and the irritating \"Full Monty\". The other pictures which were nominated in the main category were \"L.A. Confidential\" and \"As Good as it Gets\", great movies, but \"Boogie Nights\" is still better and should have been remembered in more categories.This amazing film tells the story of Eddie Adams (Mark Wahlberg, in a surprisingly great performance), a 17 year old barman who takes the attention of Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds, in a redeeming acting), a director of porn films. Eddie has a special 'gift', and this helps him to get into the world of porn movies. He changes his name for Dirk Diggler and starts to make a huge success. But fame... doesn't last forever. Other characters also have their parallel stories- Amber Waves (Julianne Moore, perfect), Buck (Don Cheadle) and others, including Rollergirl (Heather Graham), an actress who accepts to do anything, but she has to be wearing her roller shoes.What could have been a banal, trivial film, turns into a perfect, memorable one in the hands of Paul Thomas Anderson. What makes \"Boogie Nights\" such a great film is its execution, added to a clever, well written screenplay, great soundtrack, etc. Each character is very well developed, and each of them has his/her importance in the context. Each feeling, weakness, fear, emotion is explored, resulting in a masterpiece of the modern American cinema.\"Boogie Nights\" is a strong, impacting picture that should be seen by everyone who really likes cinema. Under a plot that seems banal at first impression, there is a wonderful story of highs and downs, things that we face in our lives. It is an amazing portrait of the end of the '70s and the beginning of the '80s, exactly an age of highs and downs. That's what makes this film so special and a true masterpiece. 10/10",

Too many film fans equate 'EXTREME self-indulgence' to 'film GENIUS!', but I don't buy into that cult of personality. A film should be about its subject, not its director (unless it's a Woody Allen film, of course). *SPOILER* (which is just as well, save your time...) There is nothing brilliant about of showing you the foot-long porn-star's you-know-what in the last frame- that's actually called a tacky maneuver that SCREAMS film-school hackism. The poseur flick has achieved 'great film' status based on its indulgence and pandering to the audience \u0096 which, first and foremost, is the writer/director. But the rest of the audience should look down on the surly, brutal nature of the porn biz, too. The flick had an aloof angle to the porn industry, looking down on each and every player it could bash. No matter, just love your writer/director. Love those four-minute steadicam segments, which are supposed to show the energy of the moment, but somehow had all the verve of an off switch. Love the story- no matter how dull it is- about the gee-whiz rise and sordid fall of a porn star. But look down on it, too, of course. While the subject has the potential to be fascinating \u0096 innocence, money, degradation, beauty- your worshipful writer/director somehow managed to make it all look, again, DULL. Partly because of its run time. Here is something your auteur hero DIDN'T try: Giving the characters dimension. Or soul. Anything AT ALL to give a hoot about, aside from Genius That Paul Is, of course. But I'm not buying. I don't buy into indulgent hacks with astounding hype.

Written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson this story is one about a family of pornographers and their antics and relationships and anti-relationships and how seeming innocence can blossom into a wild ride of crime and drug-addled existence.What makes this noisy, overly long (155 minutes) loud mess of a film work so well is the cast of actors gathered for both bit roles and leading character studies. Burt Reynolds is the director head of the porn family who 'discovers' Eddie Adams AKA Dirk Diggler has a prodigious physical attribute that is guaranteed to 'make him a star'. Rather innocently Dirk becomes involved with the porn industry but falls down that road of drugs and crime with the only remaining attribute being the anatomical part that is responsible for his rise to fame. Along the way we met his fellow porn star John C. Reilly, the gay photo crew member Philip Seymour Hoffman, porn queen Julianne Moore, Heather Graham on skates, Don Cheadle as a former porn star who gets caught up in a Tarantino-type murder spree in a doughnut shop, Alfred Molina as a zany coke-head, and other characters played by Thomas Jane, William H. Macy, Nicole Ari Parker, Philip Baker Hall, Melora Walters, Luis Guzman... it just goes on an on.Anderson creates multiple vignettes that allow us, the audience, to understand these wildly crazy people's need for acceptance and for forgiveness and redemption. The film has become a cult project - one that despite how fine he is in this role that Mark Wahlberg would probably rather see just go away (especially his final scene). It is a colorful, feisty, naughty, fun peak at the forbidden. It will be around for a very long time! Grady Harp",

It is very realistic and covers everything from drug use to suicide to homosexuality to child pornography.  The movie truly opens one's eyes to many aspects of this type of lifestyle.

The scope is broad, the cast is large, the movie is unfailingly entertaining (although a prosthetically-enhanced Mark Wahlberg is perhaps a little too sweet for his role). What's surprising is that, in spite of its apparently sordid subject matter, it's a lot less dark than 'Hard Eight' or 'Magnolia', two other films of Anderson's I've seen; Jack Horner (a grey-curled Burt Reynolds), who wants to make art porn (or at least, porn movies that have real plot and character), is presented almost as an Ed Wood-style idealist, albeit with the significant difference that porn pays rather better than sci-fi. It could even be said that complete absence of social commentary (exemplified by deliberate decision to end the story just before the coming of A.I.D.S.) means that this is fundamentally a film about nothing; but it's still hard not to enjoy.",

As a result, he uses the stage name Dirk Diggler. Armed with his charisma (as well as his private parts), he skyrockets to fame circa 1977. He manages to achieve wealth and prestige beyond his wildest dreams. But then comes the twist: His egotism, his arrogance and his drug-use (many of his friends and co-stars are also victims of such vices) led to his downfall by 1982 and 1983, temporarily living a life of crime before finally pulling his act together.Unlike many films of recent times, which tend to script the past in a very biased and cartoonish manner, this movie shows the true mentality of the late 1970s and early 1980s. The use of the trends of the time as well as contemporary songs in the soundtrack show the feeling that you are actually there . The story is dead-on realistic as it shows the two sides of the porn industry, without any really obtrusive sex scenes. The cast is also dead-on perfect as well, with Mark Wahlberg giving an unusually impressive performance (He needed to take a number of Drama Lessons in order to audition for this role), a performance which he never lived up to in later films. Julianne Moore was definitely Oscar and Bafta material as the leading porn figure who pays the price for her involvement with drugs and the industry. Burt Reynolds also impresses as Jack Horner, the egotistical and ambitious director who is surrounded by an equally egotistical and greedy crowd. To put it down in a few things, there is good and evil in every one of us, and this movie shows such figures as being both influential as well as vulnerable.The movie is flawed only by over-length-- some scenes feel like they're forcefully extended to make way for the soundtrack-- and and is at times a little too exaggerated and far-fetched, but the acting and direction as well as the storyline are unusually brilliant. Although it fared decently in the US and flopped in the UK, it fulfils all the requirements of being a masterpiece",

Paul Anderson has demonstrated since this masterpiece came out that he's no one trick pony, with one bold story after another and no treading on the same terrain like some other directors we could name.His script is sprawling, in the best sense of the term. So many people looking for happiness and finding it interwoven with pain, boredom, cyclical frustration and growing, if not wiser, certainly older. The song titles are like what silent movie insert cards were so many years ago and push the drama along. \"Fooled Around and Fell In Love\", \"Do Your Thing\", \"Ain't No Stopping Us Now\", \"Brand New Key\", \"Livin' Thing\"... they pretty much speak for Dirk Diggler/Eddie Adams and his voyage.The barely old enough to shave youth takes all the tests the world has to offer and with his wide eyed self absorbing it all in, he becomes a person who gets in over his head before his head even leaves his pillow in the morning. Mark Wahlberg ended any doubts as to whether he was a gifted actor with his firecracker performance. Eddie became \"Dirk\" and nothing is ever the same for him and the motley crew he adopts as his new family.Burt Reynolds gives a beautifully philosophical touch to his Jack the director. Having reached an age when he can look back on his half decade stint as the top box office star with some wisdom, now a lifetime of seeing the rise and fall of many actors (including himself) gives the role great depth. Who understands the excitement, ennui, despair and release of stardom better?The late, great Bob Ridgely appears as the Colonel, the ever reliable Wiiliam H. Macy plays Little Bill like his life depends on it and the incomparable Philip Baker Hall lends his regal presence to a tiny, but huge in impact appearance. Heather Graham, Joanna Gleason and Julianne Moore are more believable women than 99% of the female roles other actresses get to play. The rest, too many to all list, are just so wonderful, this is one of the few films which deserved the kind of cast award SAG gives out. It's an acting picture as much as a writer's or director's.",

It is increasingly engaging, entertaining and really never dull.Filled with many unique and interesting characters, and full of great subplots and story lines that everything occurring is quite a unique ride and a must watch until the very end.What makes this film as great is not only the characters of course, or the chemistry between these characters, it's how everything ties together in the end. This somewhat reminded of Pulp Fiction in that sense.Boogie Nights is quite a hard rated R movie, but this was most definitely needed and not watered down in the slightest. It shows the ups and downs of the adult film industry and shows how much work it can take to make it in that industry. A lot of memorable scenes throughout.Overall, Boogie Nights is bold, daring and the performances from each lead (mainly Mark Wahlberg and Burt Reynolds but everyone was great) bring a specific magic that carries the entire picture throughout.Even though the film is quite lengthy, with a running time of over two hours thirty five minutes, but since much is happening, it doesn't feel nearly as long or even boring. We rarely see films like this in today's day, and having watching this for the first time this year- 2019, one can say that this movie holds up greatly.",

This drama which, without prejudice and attitude, impartially tells about 70's porn industry, at the very transition from theaters to videotapes, I watched primarily because of the fantastic cast. Burt Reynolds, Julianne Moore, John C. Reilly, Heather Graham, William H. Macy, William H. Macy, and three Academy Awards nominations grant at least that it's not a bad movie. The screenplay is pretty much clich\u00e9 story about rise and fall of any star in show business, but acting and characterization are really good and make us bind to the characters real easy. Also, beautiful (and naked) women and good music are always a welcome bonus. But this potential masterpiece is flawed by its length. It is good, but not good enough to hold undivided attention for two and a half hours. Somewhere about half, it has begun to loosen its grip and, I cannot say I was bored, but it simply lost me. Still, its cast is reason enough to recommend it anyway.7/10",

            "content": "Epic in scale, brilliantly acted and utterly mesmerizing to watch, \"Boogie Nights\" is one of the greatest American movies I've ever seen, a rival to the \"Godfather.\" I don't think it's a coincidence that both films are about criminal empires (the mob, the porn industry) and there are some heavy Oedipal undertones to both (Michael and Vito Corleone, Dirk Diggler and Jack Horner). Only when we're watching underworld figures can we confront the ruthlessness necessary to succeed in American society: we can understand why a gangster like Michael Corleone will have his own brother-in-law killed, we accept that a semi-literate hustler like Eddie will prostitute himself to fame and fortune, but it's a bit more disturbing to think that people who conquered on the right side of the law might be just as vicious or amoral (witness the sanitized, vulnerable Howard Hughes of \"The Aviator\" or the noble \"Patton\"). As for father-son conflict, it's a staple of storytelling and film-making and what's remarkable about both \"Godfather\" Pt I and \"Boogie Nights\" is that the breach is healed . . . and that's not necessarily a good thing.Where \"Godfather\" was visually grandiose, with vivid, almost lurid uses of shadow and color, \"Boogie Nights\" has a sunny, bleached-out look appropriate to its Southern California setting, a nice illustration of a point made about that particular region of the country, and all the nefarious industries that occur there: the weather is so nice you don't really notice all the evil. Anderson's boldest move is his deployment of the soundtrack to underscore the narrative, which harks back to opera and its use of leitmotiv: the songs playing always comment on the action either blatantly (\"Driver's Seat\" when Floyd Gondolli enters) or ironically (\"God Only Knows\" when Amber Waves drags Dirk Diggler into his house for a cocaine binge). Anderson also uses montage, which would be trite except for the way he subverts the clich\u00e9 by making the characters look silly (although it's probably impossible to retain too much dignity when \"Boogie Shoes\" by KC and the Sunshine Band is playing in the background).As for the actors, well, they're all pretty damn remarkable and they all throw themselves wholeheartedly into these anti-heroic characters. Mark Wahlberg exposes himself in every way imaginable (and yes, I mean emotionally). It's hard to imagine a braver performance, especially when he sings (oh yeah, he sings). Julianne Moore is charming despite the fact that she's playing a psycho, and this film dates from the period when she couldn't get noticed without taking her pants off so you can look forward to that, too. Heather Graham is both cute and scary (and sweet Jesus, is she hot). As for Burt Reynolds, I'm not sure the entire film wasn't an excuse to make him look good -- he's Burt Reynolds playing Burt Reynolds, but in this case, it just f**kin' WORKS. The movie is a brilliant achievement, perhaps underrated because of its sleazy subject matter -- but honestly, is there a better metaphor for capitalism than the porn industry?",

Take a bunch of ignorant porn stars who forget what they are there for, to make smut, and they all end up taking themselves way too seriously as actors. For example when Dirk started thinking he was the second coming of bond as Brock Landers and when Buck, the black porn star went to the bank to get a loan and called himself an actor to the loan officer. Also notice how Dirk was practicing his lines in the first porn scene as if the lines really mattered anyway. I also noticed how much Amber wanted to be a mother figure having lost her real children in a custody battle. She first turns to Dirk, Dirk then leaves and she takes Rollergirl as her \"child\". The coke scene Where Rollergirl states to Amber, \"Amber will you be my mom?\"The most brilliant scenes were when Dirk was in the recording studio trying to do some Loverboy rip-off act and the drug scene gone bad at the end \"die you puppies!!!!!!!\". What amazes me is that these actors were able to all act as ignorant as they appeared in the film.Everything works out at the end though and Jack Horner ends up being the good guy taking everyone back who helped him in the beginning. Even though they were virtual losers in every other aspects of their lives, although outcasts maybe a better description. An example of Jack Horner's charity the next time you watch the film, is when Jack allows Buck to install a stereo hi-fi system even though Jack doesn't show much interest in the hi-fi system. Jack Horner at the end of the film if you notice, becomes some type of paternal figure to all of these people taking them all back in as though hey are some tight knit family.9 out of 10\n>",

            "review_title": "\"Boogie Nights\" Remains An Enlightening Masterpiece Of '90s Film-making, While Viciously Exposing The Other Side Of The Film Industry",
            "content": "Boogie Nights charts the story of infamous porn star Dirk Diggler (Mark Wahlberg), a young man striving to become something in the wide world. He is not the sharpest tool in the shed, but he has a talent on one side of the life spectre and quickly becomes a media icon. Boogie Nights shows the rise and fall of Dirk Diggler and the close-knitted friends he works with. Generally speaking, the film is based around the real facts, capturing the needed essence and realism of the porn world. The core of Boogie Nights is that it is a reflective character study that entertains, amuses, shocks, thrills and educates the viewer.Boogie Nights is a film where you become part of a journey, this journey is one that shows you just how exploitive and derogatory the porn industry is Think \"Goodfellas\", but instead of gangsters you have pornographers. You can tell Paul Thomas Anderson has been influenced by Martin Scorsese's '90s cinema because there is an edge of Scorsese-flair direction hanging over Boogie Nights. At first look I thought Boogie Nights would just be a highly entertaining study telling the story of the porn industry, however Boogie Nights holds a message and rather than just being a film, it becomes a deeply insightful study.Boogie Nights pulls the viewer inside a world fuelled by casual sex and drug abuse. At heart, Boogie Nights is extremely anti certain elements of the porn industry. Boogie Nights slowly changes from being a highly enjoyable drama to becoming a demeaning study of wasted life and a lesson in social history. The film depicts everything, it does not hesitate to show the truth and reveal to the viewer the fascinating warped lifestyle that some people live.Everything is so fast, a plunge into a new lifestyle, a new culture, a new group of people, who at heart are a new family and the people who represent the confidence that Dirk Diggler never had from his parents. You are supposed to pity Dirk Diggler because he never had the love and care that he needed. There was not enough hope for Dirk Diggler before his success in the overpowering porn industry. But porn was his freedom and his route away from his mundane life. Yet, does it make him a better person? The answer is a simple, no, because he soon becomes a nasty person, controlled by his self-indulgence and loss of respect. You see, Boogie Nights is not about sex, it is not meant to turn us on because what it is about is a business that has shattered many people's lives.Boogie Nights is not a sleazy film, nor is it not a lurid film; however it is an extremely honest film that is not afraid to educate the viewer on what the porn industry does to the people. Boogie Nights made me think that porn is not just \"fun and games\", but it is actually exploiting people who have very few options in life. Another sad fact was that the actors and filmmakers consider what they were doing to be excellent and they truly felt they were making good films; it saddened and amused me to see them considering their work to be \"well made\". It made me sad to see just how ignorant they all were, what at heart is nearly as bad as an Ed Wood film.Paul Thomas Anderon's talent bursts onto screen with a vivid and colourful spectrum of material. He gives a script that pulses with hysterical humour, quotable dialogue, brilliantly structured narrative and a raw edge. The story layout is glorious and has many twists and turns, showing every little effect. One of the film's most memorable film-making characteristics is the use of tracking shots, arguably the finest to ever be put on film. Boogie Nights has that authentic vibe that captures '70s and '80s pop culture with a delicate force. The use of tracking shots gives the film a needed documentary effect. It is a visionary experience and one where Paul Thomas Anderson loves his wonderfully flawed characters which he has carefully crafted. The film also sums up the contrast of how violence becomes a trial for the lives of the characters, it is a perfected transition. Paul Thomas Anderson captures the pop culture with excellence and hilarity, by using a variety of '70s and '80s iconic songs you feel pumped inside the era. The editing is amazingly clean-cut and with the use of quick shots, close-ups and a variety of unique techniques we become plummeted into the world and introduced to many characters through incredibly '90s film-making.The ensemble cast is awe-inspiring, it adds to the mixture of quirky comedy and emotional driving force. There are so many talented actors and actresses who deliver career defining performances, which are some of the finest in modern cinema history. The entire cast light up the screen and create amusingly likable characters, who you manage to feel sympathy for. The actors and actresses control the viewer and help draw you inside the underworld of the porn industry, shedding light on what really happens and the unpleasantly genuine effects.I would consider Boogie Nights a depressing film, yet one that also has an element of hope and edge of inspiring attitude because it shows that some people are able to change the nastiness they have dug themselves into. It works as a brilliant comedy, an insightful drama, a detailed study and an entertaining work of art. It has everything a true masterpiece needs. Many aspects of Boogie Nights are unpleasant One of the best films ever made, there is no questioning the sheer force and wonderful charm of wit which Boogie Nights holds. I guess Dirk's motto is true to Boogie Nights, and much more, \"everyone is blessed with one special thing\".",

Everybody in the picture is seeking some kind of acceptance and they eventually achieve it by working together in the adult film business. Keep in mind, that during the 1970's, adult films were seeking to compete with mainstream movies as a viable form of entertainment.

If you have no interest in a movie about porn, this movie deserves to be seen anyway merely on the basis of the acting. Like in \"Magnolia\", P.T. Anderson gathered some great actors and said 'GO' (pretty much the same actors, too).We follow the life of Eddie Adams as he is discovered by a porn director, through his porn career, and through the aftermath as things careen out of control. Also like 'Magnolia', this movie has several subplots with some of the other porn stars, but even the subplots pretty much stay focused on Eddie/Dirk. I was real dissappointed to see yet another \"how drugs can make things bad\" theme show up in yet another movie, but at least some of the drug material is shown at a fresh angle.  I was really happy when the drug part turned into just another part of the movie instead of the main focus.\nThe \"drug\" lifestyle contains inherent drama, and it is almost cheating for a writer to fall back on this tired old theme just to create drama where he doesn't feel like thinking it up on his own.  (See \"Requiem for a Dream\", the best and hopefully the last \"how drugs can make things bad\" movie).\nI was quite pleased to see real porn stars in the movie, and I'm not sure why (Nina Hartley, Veronica Hart, there were probably more). The 'giveaway' at the end leads you to think about the entire movie, and how this guy's entire life was merely because of one \"special\" thing.

I was absolutely knocked out the first time I saw it on the big screen (and this really does need to be seen at a cinema to be fully appreciated!), and still find it to be a wonderfully satisfying experience every time I re-watch it. Paul Thomas Anderson's complex script and sensational direction can hardly be faulted. The guy is a real one of a kind talent, and will hopefully continue at this high standard for many years to come. If he can keep it up, and 'Magnolia' certainly supports it, he will one day be recognized as one of the greats. The central performances of Mark Wahlberg and 70s veteran Burt Reynolds are both revelatory. Up to this point Wahlberg had movies like the enjoyable b-grade thriller under his belt, and Reynolds was long considered a washed up has-been, but both actors are more than impressive here, and help carry the movie. Wahlberg has went on to the excellent 'Three Kings' but hasn't yet really fulfilled his potential, and as for Reynolds, this is easily his greatest role to date, and one he isn't likely to top. Both are backed up by a flawless supporting cast - Julianne Moore, William H Macy, John C. Reilly, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Robert Ridgely, Heather Graham, et al. All are outstanding. This is a brilliant movie that manages to take the much ridiculed 1970s seriously, and does so with wit, humour and heart. A multi-faceted, superb example of contemporary film making.

Macy) that leads to a morbidly cascading downfall of all remaining characters, suddenly thrust and exposed into the bright-lit 1980's...Of course NIGHTS is a classic all its own - both the celebration of a porn star's life and a cautionary tale of the decadent lifestyle to get and remain there: with budding star Mark Wahlberg as porn climber Dirk Diggler...Based on John Holmes with a giant... schlong, Dirk weaves in and out of parties, drugs, family and friends, including shrieking mother Joanna Gleason, faithful sidekick-actor John C.

While Paul Thomas Anderson has arguably matured as a director (and many would say his later films like There Will Be Blood and The Master are better), I don't think any will replace Boogie Nights as my personal favourite from him.I first watched this back in 2012, when I was maybe just old enough to watch it, at the still pretty young age of 17. I loved (and honestly still do love) Tarantino, Scorsese, and De Palma, and you can clearly see that these directors were a big influence on Paul Thomas Anderson for this film. Some may see that as a detriment, but I don't think it's too derivative of anything else (though the opening shot does flirt with being very comparable to a similarly lengthy one-shot early on in Goodfellas).Anyway, the first time I watched this, I remember loving the movie so much that at about the halfway point, I felt that it was going by too quickly. So I paused the movie, did some other stuff for about half an hour, and then came back, because the movie felt too good to finish; I didn't want it to be over. Since then, I've never done this (admittedly odd behaviour) with any other film. Not even with the ones I've loved on the same level as Boogie Nights.What we have here is an ensemble cast- one of the best ever assembled- all operating at the top of their game, working with a young but incredibly talented director, and with an excellent screenplay and fantastic soundtrack carrying the whole thing along. Everything moves at a great pace, every actor and actress gets at least one extremely memorable scene to shine, and the film seamlessly flips around between being funny, sad, introspective, uncomfortable, and tense.I think I could give this close to a perfect score for the Alfred Molina scene alone. Without saying what happens, it's just 10 minutes of filmed perfection- so funny, so intense, so insane, and incredibly edited and scored with several 80s hits to boot. Most filmmakers won't make a scene that good in their entire career, and Paul Thomas Anderson did it in just his second feature, and managed to put said scene in a movie filled with countless other scenes that are almost all just as good.Boogie Nights is a must watch, for its great acting, stylish direction, memorable soundtrack, fantastic depiction of both the 70s AND 80s, and for its taboo yet always interesting subject matter. The fact that movies this good exist gives me an odd sense of hope, as if we can't be living in the darkest timeline if this timeline has blessed us with Paul Thomas Anderson, and he himself has subsequently blessed us with Boogie Nights.Watch it and rewatch it and rewatch it again. It never gets old, and it almost feels as though it hasn't aged a day. Boogie Nights is absolute perfection on celluloid.",

Perhaps I missed something but the parallels to the character Dirk Digler are unmistakable: Holmes was discovered working as a carpenter in Ohio by a low budget filmmaker (if I'm not mistaken). He began his career in photos and worked his way into the film industry. He was later involved in the Laurel Canyon murders (scene where Digler is in the producers home), his massive use of cocaine and alcohol, abuse of his girlfriends, his detective porn series, etc. Aren't these all somewhat portrayed in this movie to some degree as it ventures through 2 decades of this industry? I gave this movie 2 stars only because of its originality in tackling a very difficult topic. However, the acting for the most part , is absolutely unconvincing. Perhaps I just associate Burt Reynolds too much with the Smokey & The Bandit movies and The Longest Yard to take him seriously as an adult film producer. Mark Wahlberg just doesn't impress me as an actor at all so it's difficult for me to accept him as a porn king. The supporting cast is OK but I must agree with those IMDb reviewers that believe this storyline simply does not move along and is in fact, a bit boring. And the grand finale: Mark Wahlberg's narration as he reveals himself from the chest down is just plain stupid. My summary of this film: a sleazy account of a sleazy industry.",

The second was \"Magnolia\" Obvious parallels can be drawn between the two in terms of style and presentation.\"Boogie Nights\" is an awesome achievement and is the first movie you come to realize just how good an actor Mark Wahlberg really is. This movie elevated him from more than just another pretty face to a true actor courtesy of a magnificent performance. It was actually heartbreaking to watch at times. Of course, the fact that he was surrounded by a stellar cast certainly contributed to such an impressive performance.This is a biting look at the porn industry of the 70s and is supposedly loosely based on the life of real-life porn king, John Holmes. Nonetheless, the performances are positively phenomenal. With a cast including Don Cheadle, Julianne Moore, William H. Macy, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Burt Reynolds, John C. Reily, the often overlooked Luis Guzman, Heather Graham; need I say more? It is an unflinching look at the industry and a rather disturbing one to be sure. There is also no real or structured \"plot\" per say, but the focus is on the impact this particular lifestyle had on the personal lives of the participants and those closest to them.This is an excellent exercise in character study and is most worthy of any movie collection.

This is also the film that credited with jump starting Mark Wahlberg's Hollywood career. The film stars Mark Wahlberg, Burt Reynolds, Julianne Moore, Philip Seymour Hoffman, and Don Cheadle. The acting from every one of the cast members is spot on, great performances all around. I especially liked Moore, Wahlberg, and Reynolds. Don't get me wrong, everyone else is still very good, but those three just really shined in their individual roles, enough so for Moore and Reynolds to get academy award nominations and Wahlberg to be thrust into a very successful Hollywood acting career. Boogie Nights is all about the pornography industry, well actually its more about these specifics people in the pornography industry, and how it affects their lives. I liked how the movie handled the individual lives of each character, they really gave ample amount of time to every persons storyline. The dialogue is written in a way that pulls you in and keeps you engaged. I wouldn't say that Boogie Nights is a 10/10 or that it's absolutely perfect, but it is a very well made film that deserves a watch. 8/10.",

            "content": "There's sex, drugs, and rock n' roll aplenty in P.T. Anderson's \"Boogie Nights,\" but what makes this film stick with its audience long after the credits roll is the strong sense of family. OK, they're a family that makes the Louds look like the Brady Bunch (obligatory '70s ref there), but they are a real family, with a father figure, a mother figure, a distracted daughter, a rebel son, and a ton of aunt, uncle, and cousin-figures that each bring their unique issues to the mix.This is a recipe for overload in any fictional medium, but particularly a movie, where tight is usually right. Any other director would have trimmed away Little Bill and Becky Barnett faster than a disco downbeat, but P.T. Anderson does a very rare and brave thing. He not only puts these characters in, but allows his camera and script to linger on each of them, way past the point of no return in anyone else's movie. But rather than boring you, the result here is a depth of detail and lived-in feeling that brings you aboard for the whole run. It's what makes P.T. Anderson a great director. Yet it may also render him incapable of making a great movie. Discipline is not his strength.\"Boogie Nights\" is close, though. It's a very good film, a high 8 in my book, and a movie I can get lost in over and over again. Maybe it's because I came of age in the late 1970s, and see it recaptured here in a way it has never otherwise been, in all its confused, giddy, over-the-top glory. The pace of the first half of the film is languid and measured, never rushed, yet as a whole it chugs along with an assurance that makes it hard to accept the filmmaker was only making his second major picture.People talk about the opening scene, and it's very good, but there's other highlights. The pool party at Jack's, for example, is a marvel of storytelling economy, moving through several episodes without ever feeling like any are being shortchanged. We get an earful of Reed and Eddie's first meeting, awkward pauses and all, then get introduced to the Colonel and his coke-happy date, to Scotty Jay and his crush on Eddie, then Eddie rechristening himself (in a hot tub no less, how SoCal) \"Dirk Diggler.\" All that plot is thrown at us, but the biggest takeaway for us is a sense of the characters, because P.T. Anderson is the kind of director who makes character-driven films first.There's a lot of great detail on the porn industry subculture that feels very real and lived in, and the humor is outrageous at times (Dirk's audition with Amber, Scotty Jay's obvious gawkiness around his dream boy, Buck's image issues) without ever feeling pushed or artificial. You get a lot of depth here, the kind that rewards repeat viewings.The second half of the film loses me a little. I understand the story changes with the new decade, but it suddenly becomes so oppressively dire that the viewer, once swept into the story, has to pull away from misery overload. It's hard to pick a single excessive moment, maybe its just the way all of them come together to create a perfect storm of melodrama.That said, the Raheed Jackson sequence is the standout of the movie; a brilliant way of wrapping up Dirk's odyssey and bringing us back home. The suspense build up is incredible, and it's the one time that the film's main co-star, its soundtrack, is allowed center stage, transforming banal pop smashes like \"Jessie's Girl\" and \"Sister Christian\" into something operatic, even anthemic. We know Dirk's going nuts because the guitar break in \"Jessie's Girl\" tells us so.P.T. Anderson is a director I will always watch, but he does let his characters' emotions carry him away (more in \"Magnolia\" than here, but here, too). It's a tribute to his underlying genius that even at his most baroque, he manages to draw you into his world and hold you there like nobody else in the business. He's the kind of talent that will only improve with time, and it will be a pleasure keeping tabs on his development.",

            "content": "\"Boogie Nights\" is a lot of talking, a lot of dialogue that goes nowhere. Not much happens, and if something does happen, it is of little or no consequence for the rest of the movie. A woman overdoses on cocaine at a party - she gets carted away to a hospital and is never seen or heard of again. One character shoots two people and then himself, and that's that. There are two other shootings later, but the survivors just walk away. No police ever show up. One character does land in prison, but for something else that isn't even part of the movie.While the movie focuses on the Mark Wahlberg character, it does not exclusively follow his rise and fall as a porn actor. It occasionally follows other characters' lives (such as \"Buck\"'s) for no good reason, and it could have easily been an hour shorter if it hadn't digressed so many times. There are also scenes at the beginning which I suppose are meant to motivate the main character's actions - like his mother yelling at him. But he seemed to have already made up his mind anyway, so the glimpse into his home life doesn't really add much information, and since his parents are never seen again, it is yet another loose thread in a movie that has a lot of them.There is a lot of drug use and some of the main characters spend quite a lot of time acting drugged out. But except in the case of that one overdose, which is treated as no big deal and not followed up on, the drug use seems to be of little consequence.At best, this movie feels like a somewhat boring and rather tedious pseudo-documentary of the porn industry in the late 70's and early 80's. It even contains the making of a (pseudo-)documentary of the main character's career! Since a few other reviewers have commented that the documentary aspect of the movie is not very good (i.e. it is far from a true representation of the porn industry), I don't really know what's left of this movie that one might recommend.",

I liked the whole main narrative, but of particular interest to me was the subplot that surrounded the character played by Don Cheadle. I think that one could've been a story of its own. For a movie about the 70's sex industry, there was surprisingly, a lesser amount of sex than you might have thought there would be. I think the decision to do the movie that way paid off in more than avoiding an NC-17 rating. With the sex not as explicit, there was more time to focus on character development and plot. I remember thinking to myself that although not exactly the two parents, 2.2 kids, picket fence and garage stereotype, that the characters were a family, with all the good and bad events that happen in a time frame, and they for the most part managed to survive all that was thrown at them.",

The problem is that after 40 minutes the story takes a nose dive and the result is a total mess. From then on you have to sit through over 2 hours of total mishmash as Wahlberg and Reynolds get more irritating by the minute.  Not even the presence of screen beauties Julianne Moore and Heather Graham make you care what happens as the script plods along through the years. All in all another film which is very over rated.

            "content": "In a nutshell, \"Boogie Nights\" is a rare movie in that steps out of the lines in terms of categorization. The movie surfaces around the pornography business. Even though there is a fair amount of steaming seductive scenes, it's content is not overly gratuitous. There is a lot of humour delivered here, it's mostly dark and at times a bit hard to swallow at times. A plethora of the settings and situations were not intended to be entertaining, but one couldn't help but to be intrigued by the scenes as they were very entertaining in spite of it almost three hour duration.The structure of the film is not very perpendicular that makes this movie stand up above the rest. There is no spoon-feeding in terms of delivery by director/writer Paul Thomas Anderson, instead it's customized to play with your mind which is obscure in the film business. Can anyone name me a moment in a movie where they install a very lustful sex scene and turn it into one very mundane effort that continues on for so long? \"Boogie Nights\" succeeds in its attempt to show how unglamourous the sex industry really is as it's nothing more than all in a day's work.Set in the 1970's and 1980's, principal characters in the movie include Eddie Adams (Mark Wahlberg who was very dominant in his role), who is taken by awe by a porno guru Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds who was also quite impressive) as he transforms Adams into a porn star and goes as far as to change his name to Dirk Diggler.Diggler's rise in the porn star business is weaved by other performers that share the world he's gotten himself into. There's the doped up porn queen Amber Waves (Julianne Moore), who's like a mentor to Dirk because she is off limits from seeing her own biological child. John C. Reilly was a standout as Dirk's best pat Reed Rothschild. Heather Graham was brilliant and beautiful as Rollergirl and feels her comfort zone is when she performs using her roller-skates. Then there's Buck Swope (Don Cheadle), who likes to dress like Gene Autry and has further ambitions to open up a video store. And finally there's Little Man, (William H. Macy) who has bottled up anger because his wife constantly commits infidelity on a regular basis and shows absolute no remorse for her actions. Director Anderson follows his narration much to the tradition of Robert Altman by executing his story in a vignette approach.The constant rags-to-riches story as a whole is both funny, terrifying, melancholy, but still succeeds in lifting your hearts at the the right time. One of the more engaging scenes is when Dirk cuts a deal with a druggie. The problem is the crack he's selling is superficial and the dealer's pad is filled with goons while this is happening, firecrackers are being lit all to the song of Night Ranger's \"Sister Christian\". This scene was perfectly executed that the fear and tension comes to life and while you're watching the scene the fear takes charge into the rooms you're sitting at. If thats not top notch directing, than what is? The performances were brilliant, but it was Reynolds and Moore that had the strongest performances. The feeling of the 1970's and 1980's looks very authentic (even the poster of Cheryl Tiegs on Dirk's wall looks groovy), and the music is truly far out. It definitely is one of the best films of the 1990's and though Anderson may have patted himself on the back a little too much, all the flaws can be forgiven easily due to the vibrant energy and the engaging performances.",

Last March I finally saw it and I had to say that I was very impressed and it stood to my expectations.It begins in 1977 with Eddie Adams (Mark Wahlberg) that lives with his abusive mother and works as a dish-washer in a night club when is noticed by porn movies director Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds) who auditions him instantly. After the upteenth discussion with his mother, Adams leaves home and moves in with Horner in his mansion. Adams soon changes name in Dirk Diggler and becomes an overnight sensation because of his charisma, good looks and big sausage. With the money he manages to buy a new house, a huge new wardrobe and a Corvette. With his friend Reed Rothchild (John Reilly), Dirk stars in a series of action-themed porn films and use cocaine on a regular basis. Because of this, Dirk fails to having boners, has frequent mood swings and becomes irritated with a new adult actor Jack has assumed. After lots of disaventures in 1984 Dirk will return to his work.The direction by Paul Thomas Anderson is great not surprisingly, and the cast is full of great names in outstanding performances: Mark Wahlberg as the young porn star that goes from rags to riches thanks to his cocaine addiction but will end it in an unexpected way, Burt Reynolds as a adult movie mogul and a father figure to Wahlberg, John Reilly as Wahlberg's best friend who becomes a magician after the end of his cocaine addiction, Julianne Moore as a smoldering porn actress, Alfred Molina as an irritable drug dealer, William Macy as an assistant director always cheated by his wife, Don Cheadle as a black porn star that survives a shootout and escapes with some money... where do you find such a cast? Only in your best dreams. The soundtrack was also great, full of great songs of the years the movie is set (from 1977 to 1984) and the cinematography was kinetic and crisp. The script was very smart with lots of clever dialogue translated well to film.In substance, this is some sort of exploration of the adult entertainment industry and the American Dream that has never been seen before 1997.

I mean, there are a lot of laughs throughout, but you always laugh with a lump in your throat.

Particularly the ending, which I can't go into too much detail about, captures that idea perfectly. At first it's pretty fulfilling, but the ending gets less happy with every second you think about it. Apart from being a great, bittersweet character study, the movie also creates tremendous amounts of tension when it needs to. The scene with the drug deal that goes awry might just be the most bone-chilling scene I've ever watched. Everything about it is just perfect, right down to the use of silly 80s pop songs as the soundtrack. I was drenched in sweat after watching that part, magnificent how it gradually builds up to its unexpected climax. The only bad thing I can really say about this movie is that the practical effect in the last shot is laughably unconvincing, but even that's not really a criticism given that I can imagine them doing it on purpose.

We are treated to an intimate look at the ins and outs of the porno industry as we follow Dirk Diggler from overnight success to inevitable decline.The first thing that must be said about this film is that the cast is outstanding. It's character actor heaven with the likes of John C. Reilly, William H. Macy, Luis Guzman, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Philip Baker Hall and more. Not only that, there are others (like Mark Wahlberg) who deliver the best performances of their careers.However, all of this acting talent would have gone to waste if the screenplay wasn't up to snuff. Luckily, Anderson's script was good enough to snag an Oscar nomination. It contains plenty of humour although the tone of the film gradually darkens until the characters hit rock bottom. Overall, the story is nicely balanced and presents a fascinating view of this 'family' of pornographers.Anderson's direction is well handled though some might feel that he was just a little flashier than necessary. On the audio front, the soundtrack is yet another component of the film that deserves high praise. Vintage songs are featured prominently and the selections show a keen sense of taste and aptness.All in all, I'd rank this as one of my favorite films of the 90's. However, I can see that the subject matter and approach may not appeal to all. Nevertheless, I think that this is Anderson's best film (so far).",

Lurking behind some well-written dialogue is a mess of a movie that tries to go in too many directions.A hypnotic and continuous camera can't make up for a muddled story. I don't understand the choices the director made on the final cut. This movie is too long and lacks focus. It's a mood piece, full of dramatic irony without any real drama for balance. When SOMETHING finally happens to make things interesting there is no basis for it - no setup, no motivation. Just a plot point that is supposed to happen to move things along. Director Anderson knows how to handle a camera, but he should let someone else write the script.",

            "content": "Burt Reynolds immediately grounds us within the 70s world of pornography that seems to be at first all glitz and glamour. He is the most assured of this wild, sweeping cast - a porno king played straight. He takes his porn serious, thinks of it as an art-form, and aspires to elevate the medium to new levels even as the technological shift threatens to move from big screens to small. Not only is he the overseeing director, but he is the daddy of this f*cked up family, and even as his kingdom falls around him his arms will be wide open welcoming back his children and telling them to clean their rooms. But of course, this is not about him, but about Wahlberg's Eddie who strives to make it big after years of emotional abuse from a stunted upbringing. Anderson makes the porn star life as frenetic and glamorous as possible - from the opening take that sweeps around and unveils the crowded bar, to the whip pans and frantic zooms and camera light- bulbs flashing from all directions in the frenzied montage that says \"you've made it\". Of course, it's nothing that Scorsese hasn't already done before. And it seems that Anderson likes to pick and choose his tragedies as he pleases in order to serve the narrative; early on there is a hilarious encounter with a washed-up star that has just seen his second OD in just two days, and although this is foreshadowing, Anderson can't help but show this through a comedic lens because of the hazy, orgasmic high from Dirk Diggler's rise to stardom. Later, when the script calls for his fall from grace, drug addiction is again the vice, but it doesn't unfold in any real capacity. It's like Anderson needed a stereotypical plot device to engineer the darker moments and just throws cocaine at the screen without actually engaging with it at any deeper level. And that goes also for Macy's character, who exits with the most self-indulgent little nod you might see from a suicide scene. The rest of the 'family' have their own f*cked up problems, although the theory that leaving the family results in tragedy doesn't seem to hold up when you point the camera at Julianne Moore. Her own storyline is tragic enough; having lost out on custody of her actual kid, she spends her days codling and mothering Dirk as a way of compensating for her previous loss. But Anderson feels the need to condescend these heart-wrenching emotions by focusing on her sobbing after another failed attempt to win back visitation rights. How can we pity someone when we do not know the whole story, but are merely pushed into the act of sympathy because pornography is somehow being demonised? It works a little better for Don Cheadle's Buck, where we see the visible frustration at being not taken seriously because he acted in a few pornos.It seems that Anderson grows the story from these characters, the live-wire humour, the zany, half believable situations they find themselves in. There are smaller moments of characterisation that are allowed to stand for themselves. The sweet little \"ki-yaa\" that Buck and Jessie share in the car, both having somehow escaped from the toxicity of the family and made a life for themselves (although even then Anderson has to shove the most inexplicably coincidental bit of violence to kickstart it). And Heather Graham's Rollergirl, a bundle of sexual energy that glides around everywhere in her skates and almost makes us forget she is just a kid still in school. But if you pull away for the bigger picture it seems all too inconsequential. Philip Seymour Hoffman has a heartbreaking moment, and then just sort of disappears. Wahlberg's rise and fall seems completely determined by the script rather than actual cause and effect in the narrative - when he can no longer get hard, the cause is because of his drug addiction, but this hasn't been expanded on, but merely presented as a symptom of burn out in the high stakes porno industry. And Anderson adds dissolves to the crucial scene, instead of letting the built-up frustration from Wahlberg take its natural toll (this might be because Wahlberg has never really been a great actor, but at the time he seemed fresh). Why not let the film roll, like he does in that tense cooker-pot situation where the fireworks keep making the group jump and they slowly realise this is a bad idea? Wahlberg sits there frozen for a good 45 seconds as he comes to the realisation. It's also one of the only scenes where Anderson's use of 80s pop hits doesn't seem like an ironic touch (although that just might be because of Molina's fantastically unhinged performance - \"He's Chinese...). These are the worn out tracks from the jukebox, the tunes that everyone knows even if they didn't experience that era. It's phony.",

Anderson is a great writer and director and BOOGIE NIGHTS deserved an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture and Best Actor - Mark Wahlberg, and should have won Best Supporting Actress - Julianne Moore.BOOGIE NIGHTS is filled with many different types of characters. Mark Wahlberg turns star in this picture with twelve inches to his name. As Dirk Diggler, he becomes a great porn star with the help of Jack Horner - Burt Reynolds, Rollergirl - Heather Graham, Amber Waves - Julianne Moore and many more. BOOGIE NIGHTS is centred around all these characters and the hardships they go through to be porn stars and what happens to them when their stardom and lives collapse.With drugs, nudity, and violence, BOOGIE NIGHTS is an all right movie. Of course it's not for children, but it is an interesting sight to see. Even if you take away the sex, if you think about it BOOGIE NIGHTS has an interesting story line. Thumbs up to PAUL THOMAS ANDERSON. I hope the best for him. MAGNOLIA and HARD EIGHT are interesting and I believe that Anderson, by the end of his career will have a couple of Academy Awards. I know that if he asked me to be in one of his pictures, I know I would accept, not even looking at the script. GO P.T. ANDERSON!!!",

It is just such a cool and great movie that I can't help but watch it all the time!I first saw it a year ago last summer. I recorded it because I knew it was gonna be cool. And sure enough, I got a great film!I hate when people say, \"Oh, Boogie Nights is that movie about porn that everyone's talking about.\" Sure, Boogie Nights is about porn, but it is not a porno itself. It follows a colorful group of porn makers: the stars (Dirk Diggler, Reed Rothchild, Amber Waves, Jessie St. Vincent, e.t.c) and the filmmakers (Jack Horner, Little Bill, Kurt) through six very colorful years: '77 to '83. There we see their heyday when an unknown teen, Eddie (Mark Whalberg) is transformed into Dirk Diggler. Then we see their fall (Dirk is almost replaced by his director, Jack [Burt Reynolds]). I would tell you more, but...well, you just have to see it for yourself.This is my and my best friend, Tony's favorite film. We've both seen it a million times and know it by heart: from \"Jackie, Jack, Jack\" to \"I'm a star of a star of a star\".With colorful characters like Rollergirl (sexy Heather Graham), Dirk Diggler, Rahad Jackson, e.t.c and great performances from Graham, Reynolds (I'm shocked), Whalberg, Moore, and Macy added to writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson's pure artwork, forget Titanic!

At the start of the film you cant help but really like the people, they all have there own personalities. They all start of as a sexy group of people and after the drugs kick in they become inwardly ugly. In a way the film does take a down turn when their personalities change simply because you dont quite like them as much as before and that says a lot for the cast.

            "content": "I gave this movie a eight because I later discovered that certain shots and dialogue were plagiarized from other films. That's not saying though that this wasn't a kick-ass, well-executed film! I heard so many opinions (a lot of them negating) over the years. And it never occurred to me ever to write a review about the most profound film that rocked my world since the original \"Star Wars\" did when I was six. I read numerous reviews on this site that were both good and bad, but they ALL said that this was a powerful film.To this day, I always feel as if I'm in a sudden time-warp when viewing this, and that this is actually happening within the years of 1977-1984. There is so much attention to detail and dialogue in this movie, and there are never gags or contrived period-piece references for the sake of telling the audience \"hey, this is in fact 1977! Look at the hair! Look at the disco ball! Listen to the music!...\" Films like \"The Wedding Singer\" are just loaded with them! The film is about the rise and the fall of Dirk Diggler/Eddie Adams (Mark Wahlberg)- a high school dropout working a dead-end job with a care-free attitude that helps him glide into the porno industry with ease. Discovered at a nightclub by Jack Horner (played by the charismatic Burt Reynolds), he quickly meets and associates with other actors at Jack's house, who are in fact damaged goods with porn as their guise. They have been outcasted from society at one point in time, and really hold on to their dignity through this and drugs. It's not long before Dirk makes it big because of the size of his tool, and his notoriety continues throughout the first half of the film. William H. Macy's actions on New Year's Eve of 1979 set a darker tone for the bottom-half of the movie, and each main and supporting character is systematically \"punished\" in some way. Beginning with the slow, pudgy grip/gopher Scotty (Phillip Seymour Hoffmann), who makes an unsuccessful homosexual pass at Dirk; the beforehand mentioned assistant director, Little Bill (William H. Macy) suicides; their producer/distributor, the Colonel James (the late Robert Ridgely) is jailed for statutory rape; Dirk himself gets subsequently fired (for exploding into a volatile, verbal, drug-induced outburst with Reynolds); Reed Rothchild (John C. Reilly) is punished by accompanying Dirk in his downward spiral with cocaine and bad luck; Buck (Don Cheadle) is turned down for a loan because of his involvement with porn; Jack is subjugated to making movies on videotape instead of film, thus the films seem to lose their zest and become numb and banal. Amber (Julianne Moore) loses a custody battle with her son; Rollergirl (Heather Graham) is raped and degraded by a former classmate; Dirk is beaten up (another honorable mention); and Todd Parker (Thomas Jane) is shot and killed.The film has numerous subplots, long takes and long-shots, a phenomenal music score (where they play almost the whole song in every scene), day-glo dialogue from everyone (you feel as if the actors aren't acting), and it is all an infinitely a sad story. After Dirk's expulsion, he crawls back to Jack and is forever enslaved back into the porno industry. The film also echoes pieces of John Holmes's life (not to mention pieces from his films), Martin Scorsese's movies along with Jonathan Demme.This is the only picture from P.T. Anderson I really like. To me, I thought \"Magnolia\" and \"Punch-Drunk Love\" were just bores. He has an affinity with good dialogue, but I notice that he brings in the same team (both cast and crew) to each film. It's good and bad, but when a director is comfortable (which he seems to be with his little gang), they're not good directors. Those movies seem to be proof of it. Nevertheless, \"Boogie Nights\" is a powerful and important film that both filmmakers and critics should use as a template to continue with their careers.\"Ever see that movie 'Star Wars'? People tell me I look like Han Solo.\"I laugh every time I hear that !",

            "content": "After being stunned by the subtle artistry of Hard Eight everyone knew that Paul Thomas Anderson's sophomoric directorial effort would have to push cinema limits. And boy did it ever. It not only pushed aesthetic limits, but the limits of what you can actually get away with in movies. Boogie Nights is a film set in the 1970's adult film industry. Dirk Diggler wants to be somebody and he gets his chance after finding his way into the porn industry via a director named Jack Horner. Jack is a director with vision and he wants to elevate pornography into an art form rather than just, well... what porn is intended for. The film spans about ten years, chronicling the rise and fall of Dirk Diggler and the various characters he meets along the way. It's a fanatical ensemble piece with all sorts of spunk and nuance to it that sets it apart anything we've ever witnessed.The IMDb page for Boogie Nights wrongly categorizes it as a drama. This film is absolutely a comedy that poses as a drama at times, and it knows it is doing so. You have to face facts. The characters we are involved with here are all sorts of shady people. They are a bunch of sex crazed, coked up, short tempered sociopaths, and thats what makes it all so much fun. There is nothing like watching a coked up Alfred Molina run around in his underwear shooting at Mark Wahlberg and John C. Reily. The film does get dramatic at times, but there is that constant subtle undertone that says, \"None of this is really supposed to be taken seriously. It's all for the pure insanity and the fun.\" Anderson has really done something ingenious with his script here. Jack Horner wants to create pornography with a story in order to draw in his audience in a different kind of way. He wants to enthrall his audience in the story and then entertain them with the porn side. But the result of his aspirations is the most hysterically awful plot lines and characters that you would expect from a porno. And what is even more hilarious is how the talented actors in the film pull off God awful porn acting perfectly. And the great irony of it all is that everyone else in the film is blown away by it and they treat it like master class material. There is a scene at the Adult Film Awards where Dirk Diggler wins multiple awards for his work, while we have just been witnessing how hilariously awful the acting is. The satirical levels on which this story works are just brilliant.But not only does Anderson show off his script writing and story telling abilities in Boogie Nights, he also proves that a great script can be raised to all new heights when it is directed so incredibly well. Anderson's eye for long tracking shots and aesthetically fantastic pans is displayed here in every fashion. The film's opening shot, which starts outside of a night club, follows Jack Horner and his wife in, then proceeds to show many of the main characters in the night club is almost three minutes long. But he doesn't use all of his talent up there. We are treated to plenty more of these brilliant shots throughout the entire two and a half hour film which never gets dull and never lets up on the crazed hilarity.Boogie Nights is a film that is driven so steadfastly well by everything in the film. Anderson's script is fantastic and it tells a wildly entertaining story. His direction moves the film along at a brisk yet deliberate pace which develops every subplot just as fully as the main plot. And he also directs his fantastic actors with the same level of keen poignancy. Every performance in this film is incredible, even the brief cameos from huge names like Phillip Baker Hall or the great Alfred Molina. There's never a dull moment in Boogie Nights, probably due to the fact that every last bit of the film is unlike anything you've ever seen before. Paul Thomas Anderson took some major risks making a film about porn, yet he does it with so much satirical class and hilarious playfulness that it is difficult to dislike the film whether you find the subject matter offensive or not.",

            "content": "For more than 20 years, Paul Thomas Anderson has proven to be quite the unique filmmaker for his themes of alienation and loneliness, flawed characters, and distinct visual styles. So it's no surprise that I'd be discussing the film that helped kickstart his claim to fame, Boogie Nights. Although the title might suggest a film about disco, do not be fooled, for this is more about the pornography industry. In spite of such a crazy idea for a film, it actually works well in its favor, because a film like this could not have worked well enough without a little bit of craziness.The movie centers around a teenage busboy named Eddie Adams, who gets discovered by porn director Jack Horner and becomes a world famous adult-film star, Dirk Diggler. Despite succeeding in flying colors, Dirk begins to develop a severe ego and drug problem, which results in his downfall. Admittedly, the story itself is the typical underdog turned superstar plot where a nobody is turned into a somebody overnight but then enters a decline due to certain issues, making the viewing experience a little predictable. However, what elevates the film from its premise is how it depicts the porn business. As the film is set in the late 70s and early 80s, it displays a certain nostalgic representation of how the industry was when it came to classic exotic features. By depicting the business side of these movies, the viewing experience is set more in the shadows than the spotlight, and it's admirable to see the behind the scenes debacles of porno filmmaking.In terms of characters, Eddie is a pretty good representation of aspiring low-key actors who let their career get the best of them, and Mark Wahlberg carries enough charisma to make him charmingly energized in spite of his shortcomings. However, the character who steals the show is Jack Horner. Played wonderfully by Burt Reynolds (may he rest in peace), the man presents himself as sort of a father figure for a bizarre family of porn stars, yet he often seems more subdued with the idea of it, down to never shown having sex himself. In addition, Amber Waves is a former housewife turned porn star who is in desperate need of seeing her child again, and Julianne Moore is able to carry as much sympathy towards her character as she does with her seductive presence. Whenever Amber is with Eddie, she practically becomes a mother figure towards him, even becoming generally concerned for him during their sex scenes.Despite being about adult features, Anderson cleverly limits the nudity in the film, making the reveal of Eddie's dynamite dong all the more surprising. It's often funnier when you approach things like that subtly without revealing much, and the film takes full advantage of that, including a particular scene at a pool party where Dirk shows the financer of the features his thing offscreen for only a few seconds. My only main complaint with the film is the few subplots revolving around the supporting cast. I understand the influence of Nashville and Pulp Fiction with the variety of characters displaying differentiating human qualities in a louche world, but I personally found them to be a tad distracting and rather fluctuating in pace. Then again, at the end of the day, this film is about the fluctuating unpredictabilities that life can offer in such an infamous industry, so I suppose it fits within the context of the story.We'll probably never get another movie like this again, and we don't need to. Overall, Boogie Nights is a great commentary on the adult-film business that paints itself with a bizarre story about the crazy ups and downs of making a living, a cast of highly flawed albeit understanding characters, and a wonderful tribute to the glory days of porno. If you're into films that beautifully explore and comment on a particular subject of art and film, then this is just for you. Although given its subject matter and dark content, just be warned that this is not a movie for the sensitive viewers. If there's one thing you will get out of this movie though, it's that those who live by the sword also die by it, because people like Dirk Diggler may end up selling their dignity for the right and wrong reasons.",

            "content": "This film is a masterpiece.  It was exhilarating from beginning to end. Writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson's story about a porn star is told with style, grace, humor, even poignancy.  The actors and the characters they play are all first-rate, including Mark Wahlberg in the lead, who proves himself a solid actor and can carry a film.  Burt Reynolds gives perhaps his best performance ever as a porno director who discovers Wahlberg.  The film recreates the late 70s and early 80s with dead-on accuracy, from the disco scene that begins the film to Wahlberg's Don Johnson \"Miami Vice\" outfit that he wears in the final scene.  Most regular moviegoers who see this film will no doubt compare it to PULP FICTION, but it really has much more in common with the films of Robert Altman and Martin Scorsese.  The film is a triumph in style.  The opening tracking shot that begins the film is just as impressive as the ones in THE PLAYER and ABSOLUTE BEGINNERS.  The editing by Dylan Tichenor is simply phenomenal.  I couldn't believe the editing didn't receive an Oscar nomination (GOOD WILL HUNTING was a better edited film?!). The best scene in the film has to be the one with the firecrackers.  I had butterflies in my stomach because the scene is incredibly intense.  When I saw the film a second time, I had the exact same reaction to the scene. Unfortunately, it may not have the same impact on TV as it did in a theater with good stereo sound.  It's a shame that many people didn't see this movie during its theatrical run, because it is the best way to watch it. Anderson's use of widescreen will suffer on TV (so get the DVD or a letterbox tape).  It is amazing how easy Anderson makes it all look, because this is only his second film.  The music, sets, costumes, photography, offbeat characters, sex, violence, happiness and heartbreak are captured by a guy who is clearly in love with filmmaking.",

The fashion, the lifestyles, the music, the sex, the drugs. It's all here in large amounts. The soundtrack for Boogie Nights is one of the best you'll come across.It features so many big name actors delivering some of their best performances at once. The characters are unique, real and often quite likeable. Drugs, guns, sex, violence, darkness, humour - there's really a bit of everything here for everyone.Burt Reynolds was perfectly cast in his role as Jack Horner. Mark Wahlberg delivered his best career performance and made his character surprisingly likeable. I think I fell in love with Julianne Moore in this - her intimate scenes with Wahlberg were standouts. William H Macy, Don Cheadle and Philip Seymour Hoffman through in ample doses of hilarity whenever they were on screen too.Many memorable moments, and at the same time a complete blur too - which is fitting for the time and place it's set.

The fact that this movie is about the porn industry and one of its most famous stars leads many people to reject it, or not look deeper into what the film is really about. It starts off with sheer energy, the music, the dancing, the fabulous opening sequence filmed without any cuts by a very under rated director. the movie rolls on, introducing the viewers to many characters and their own personal problems. This is where the many interesting subplots occur. William H. Macy's character, little bill is struggling through life as his wife is constantly cheating on him without remorse, this story is sad, but funny and very ironic. Other characters such as Buck played bashfully by Don Chedale is trying to start his own business, you have Jack Horner, a man wanting to make a \"film\" a man who rejects moving to videotape, and many more. The most fascinating sub plot, is not really a subplot, and some might argue with me, but it keeps your interest one way or another. i am talking about how everybody in the movie is so fascinated with Dirk Diggler's special friend. all throughout the movie you have people seeing it and the look on their face is always priceless. for this very reason, the viewers want to see it as well. it seems to be always just out of the frame, i found this to be a very odd way of keeping the viewers alert. it is not revealed until the end.The acting is superb, this one of the best casts since the godfather, everyone in the picture plays his or her roles perfectly. PT Anderson's script is funny, intelligent, and most importantly...real. his direction is good, i enjoy his many long shots, it gives the film a sense of authenticity, allowing the viewers to completely enter this shocking world.it is fun to watch, great music, great acting, great direction, 100 percent original, fascinating sub plots and sub stories, great film.",

            "content": "Paul Thomas Anderson is a director I have a lot of praise for. I thought Phantom Thread was great and I really loved Punch-Drunk Love. Boogie Nights is one of his best.Boogie Nights focuses on the porn industry during the late 70s to 80s and takes us through a range of characters involved the line of work.Paul Thomas Anderson's examination of this industry and the period it's set in is a winner all the way. There's so much to appreciate and so much fun to be had with Boogie Nights. The opening scene alone had me hooked and transported me to its flashy and glamourous world. The use of long takes during some scenes tell me so much about the time period and the lifestyle these people lived. Despite this being Anderson's second feature, he displays a lot of confidence behind the camera by capturing the spirit of the 70s and 80s in great detail. This is a very atmospheric film where you soak in the beauty of the scenery. The soundtrack is easily one of my favourite aspects. Not only did it sound great but it contributed so much to the mood of each scene. The song choices fit extremely well for the time period and the variety of them kept me entertained and engrossed throughout. The camerawork is slick and stylish. There are incorporations of various long takes with action taking place at every corner which is not only impressive but also purposeful in terms of developing its characters and worldbuilding.For its subject matter, Paul Thomas Anderson manages to handle it in a very smart and mature manner. For a film about the porn industry, the film wasn't as sexual as I thought it was going to be. The second half of the film takes a much more dark turn which I didn't expect. The script is fantastic in every way. Dialogue plays a large role in the film and some of them are really funny. Anderson introduces us to memorable characters with interesting personalities. We learn more and more about them as the film goes on. The darker second half plays a great contrast to the first as it peels back the glamour and shows us how troubled these people really are. The acting by everyone involved and Anderson's direction helps us identify with these people during their highs and lows.Mark Wahlberg in his breakout role delivers one of his performances here. His character goes through a range of emotions and Wahlberg proves himself to be a worthy actor by conveying that range brilliantly. There is one scene however where Wahlberg argues with his mum and the acting seemed a tad off then but he did really well during the rest of the film. Burt Reynolds is amazing here and is one of the standout performers in the film. Julianne Moore and Heather Graham are also terrific. John C. Reilly surprised me by how good he was. I've gotten used to seeing him as more of a comedic actor but there are a handful of serious scenes where he shines. I loved Philip Seymour Hoffman here. He's consistently impressed me and once again he shows how good of an actor he is. Don Cheadle is also great here. The entire ensemble cast bring their A game here.I cannot wait to see Boogie Nights again. It's a very entertaining period piece that captures the industry and time period with immense detail. There are many memorable scenes and characters that are fun to watch and go through a rollercoaster of emotions. Paul Thomas Anderson demonstrates his skill and talent as writer and director once again and I hope he continues making great films like this.",

Dirk Diggler's life was crazy, beginning with being a fresh face in a fresh industry. Well as the 70's ended and the 80's began, he suddenly got a big head to match his big \"tool\". He got really into drugs and even started prostituting himself. This movie is so impressive because it is so true! This is exactly what happened to porn actors of the 70's and 80's. Just take John Holmes for example. His life was like a carbon copy of Dirk Diggler's life. Start off good, do dope, start prostituting yourself, get wrapped up in murder, and have a good career again. It really is great when they switch to VHS like many porn companies did during the early 80's. I thought that was a very subtle but important part of the ever-changing porn industry.

You know who really deserved a nomination, right along with Burt Reynolds? Robert Ridgely as the Colonel. He was awesome. Does anyone else agree with that? Also, the biggest snub in Oscar history.

Although it's set in the porn film industry, in a surprising way it's more about the extended family that develops among all these people who work together, and how things like drugs, fame, and money may have stretched those bonds, but not broken them completely (except for William H. Macy's character).  Another nice thing is how much affection Anderson has for these people, even when he acknowledges some of the bad things they may do (like how Dirk acts like a jerk because of his ego).  And the use of period music was inventive, like the 80's songs during the scene with Alfred Molina, which add to the tension of the scene.I wasn't a fan at all of Mark Wahlberg until he turned to acting, and then he started to show some talent, especially in this movie.  He acts on everything he feels as if it just occurred to him.  I'm also not a fan of Burt Reynolds, but he comes through here, because he doesn't condescend to the movie.  But of all the cast (who are really good), it's Julianne Moore who stands out, playing, in effect, the den mother, who is looked up to by her co-stars, but can't get custody of her own children.  She also pulls off the difficult trick of playing a bad actress, and she's the most convincing at it.",

            "content": "Mark Wahlberg plays Eddie, a well-endowed teenage busboy in a San Fernando Valley nightclub. One night he is discovered by blue-movie director Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds). Jack takes one look at Eddie's unwrapped package and, presto, a huge star is born. Eddie assumes a nom de porn, Dirk Diggler, and the \"acting\" jobs start coming his way. His own family life is far from ideal, so Eddie/Dirk is more than happy to move in with his surrogate parents, Jack and Amber (Julianne Moore). Amber, as in Amber Waves, is a porn star and the mother figure little Dirkie needs. He even gets to sleep with her. Soon the '70s become the '80s and the heavy drugs start taking their toll. Video has changed the porn business forever and Dirk's enormous, uh, ego has become even more engorged. Bad times are a-coming. Ambitious young studs are being groomed to take the star's place. Must he resort to hustling? Can he keep performing on cue? By 1983, poor Diggler's just one more limp Dirk. All of this sounds pretty lurid, but young director Paul Thomas Anderson keeps the heady material from dragging us down with the characters. It is all surprisingly buoyant and, at times, even affecting. Boogie Nights does take an awfully long time (152 minutes) to reach a climax. Some serious issues get the skin-deep treatment, but a more diverting R-rated fairy tale would be hard to find. The cast is near perfect. Reynolds has never been better and former underwear pinup Wahlberg shows that there is plenty to life after Calvin. Moore scores the most emotional moments, while sterling support is provided by Don Cheadle, Heather \"Rollergirl\" Graham, William H. Macy, Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Alfred Molina. The disco-heavy soundtrack is a treasure trove that will have you shaking your own groove thing, prosthetic or real.",

While a lesser filmmaker could have used this film as an excuse to be shallow and vulgar, PTA approaches this subject matter with maturity and he includes lots of depth for the amount of characters in his movie.Mark Wahlberg, Julianne Moore, and Burt Reynolds all give fantastic performances, with the supporting characters being just as good and memorable. PTA is really talented at giving his actors lots to chew on; I am constantly amazed at the high-quality of acting in all his movies. Another key feature of PTA which is highly present in this film is the fantastic camera work.There are many scenes in this film that involve long, swinging shots where the camera follows character after character for a very long time. Although some may find the camera work self-indulgent, I find that the long, unbroken takes help the viewer fit into the world. It makes it easier to relate to the characters because we feel as if we are in the situation with them.Boogie Nights is a blast from start to finish. It is a very dynamic film: we experience the characters at their highest highs and lowest lows. We root for our characters and we hate them at certain points.

Anderson has directed and written a film of great emotional depth, and the subject of porn is an area where most people would assume that emotions and human feelings are far less important than clothing at a photoshoot. The film boasts a cross section of America's finest character actors, and Anderson took an extremely big chance on a couple of actors who must have seemed like very questionable choices. By the mid 90's when BOOGIE NIGHTS was released, Burt Reynolds tabloid personal life exemplified the most lurid aspects of The Seventies, and his inclusion in the film might have detracted from Anderson's nuanced presentation of the film industry's impact upon sexual liberation. But, Reynolds delivers a perfect characterization of an American businessman who is only satisfying the public's nascent hunger for cinematic knowledge of the country's changing sexual mores.And, casting Mark Wahlberg in the lead role of Dirk Diggler was risky at best. At the time, Wahlberg was primarily known as a member of a boy band and an underwear model, but who really knew that he could be such a convincing actor? The film is very long, but never lags, and there are really far too many fine performances to note. MUST SEE",

Julianne Moore and Heather Graham play the roles of porn people so good that it really shows you the life these types of people live with all the sex, drugs, money, divorce, and many social problems they experience. Boogie Nights is one of the better movies I've seen in terms of taking a character like the Mark Wahlberg one and showing the upside with success in the 70's and the downfall to drugs in the 80's I like how it spans two decades. Boogie Nights is one of the best movies for pop culture it really shows reality of how the 70's happened even though I wasn't born till 78 I well know about the disco and styles plus the music from that era is terrific! The two volume music tapes from Boogie Nights is a must buy! Each time you watch this movie you feel like you are right with these characters because it was popular times that we all remember and with liking these characters so well who have the guts to make money from a controversial subject like pornography makes Boogie Nights all that much more of a classic that we want to feel the emotions of. Most of you will soon be like me and tape Boogie Nights and add it to your movie collection and call it a classic.",

            "content": "90s was a great decade for films. We saw uprising of this whole new breed of young talent most of whom learned about film-making through movies and books. Linklater, Tarantino, Rodrigues and of course the best of the lot Paul Thomas Anderson. They brought a sense of freshness to scripts and screenplays as suppose to the zombie film schools technical writing that we were being dished out With his second venture Boogie Nights, Anderson sought to go back to his first amateur film \"The Dirk Diggler\" story.For a young director, this was a tough film to make for several reasons. Can he make a film about Porn stars and the industry with nudity but without alienating the audience? Can he make a film that makes the audience connect to these characters who are more or less alien to these world? Can he make a film compassionate, emphatic and non judge-mental of these actors? Can he retain the audience interest and the pace of the film when it deals with so many characters with different sub plots? Can he re create the magic of swinging 70s? Of course will the prosthetic penis work? In many ways P.T.Anderson's task was just as daunting as that of Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds) who had the ambition of keeping the audiences in the theater with an enticing story even after they \"get off\" on it.The movie essentially centers around Eddie Adams (Mark Wahlberg) who is an aspiring actor, gets discovered by Jack Horner, a porn director who considers his job an art form. Eddie then changes his name to Dirk Diggler and gets sucked in the lifestyle and relationships of the pornography industry of the late-1970s. The movie is an exercise in evolution of Porn Industry through the 70s and the 80s, the highs and lows of the characters especially Dirk. It reminds a lot of the great works of Robert Altman in its \"ensemble\" nature and also of Martin Scorsese in some of the camera work. Anderson is not shy and shows of every trick in his book, even the shot of camera following the girl into the pool from Soy Cuba.The movie is fast paced, extremely funny in places, insightful in others with some of the most jaw dropping sequences one would hope to see. The sequence with Chinese crackers is out of this planet, early indications of the phenomenal talent of the man. But most of all, I feel the film is not judge-mental about any of the characters be it Rollergirl (Heather Graham, I never take my skates off), Little Bill (William H. Macy, My is wife is the back with a \"cock\" in her \"ass\"), Buck Swope (Don Cheadle), Reed Rothchild (John C. Reilly), Amber Waves (Julianne Moore), Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds) and many others who have taken this film to a new level.Arguably one the greatest movies of my lifetime, it is a must watch for one and all.",

Paul Thomas Anderson is a filmmaking genius.  One of the things I loved most about the film was PTA's use of music.  I thought I was the only one who loved the Andrew Gold song \"Lonely Boy\"!  But as brilliant as PTA is you can tell a lot of his \"style\" is lifted straight out of Scorsese.  He's a badass Scorsese doppelganger to be sure, but so much of his visual style is a shot by shot ripoff of shots from Goodfellas.I felt SO much for the character of Dirk Diggler, my heart ached for the poor guy.  We even both live in the same town, beautiful downtown Torrance! I loved the little touches of this film.  Like the title card that read \"Long Way Down (one last thing)\".  And the long take of Dirk's face when he's on the couch at the drug dealers house.  The little look of madness, of coke fiendishness, and of how far down he had sunk from being a wide eyed innocent were all brilliantly summed up in just a minute or so of facial expressions.  Fan-frigging-tastic, daddy-o!PTA has made a classic American film.  And he's still got a helluva long way to go!  Life will be good and so will the future of filmmaking as long as PTA is walking this Earth, Jack.  As an aspiring screenwriter I kinda hate him for being so talented but it's a cross I'm willing to bear, baby.  And in the words of Dirk Diggler, \"Let's Keep Rockin' And Rollin'.\"",

Mark Wahlberg (The Big Hit, Planet of the Apes) plays Eddie Adams a.k.a Dirk Diggler who longs to be famous in the late 1970's. His wish comes true when a top-class porn-film director discovers the young talent with the 13-inch penis and before long, Dirk becomes the lead in many adult-orientated films.Wahlberg throws in a performance worthy of a Golden Globe nomination - he's a charismatic lead that can hold humour and tragedy with one hand, and is backed up by awesome performances by Julianne Moore (The Lost Word, Hannibal), William H. Macy, Burt Reynolds, John C. Rielly (Never Been Kissed) and Dan Cheadle (Ocean's Eleven). One of the more memorable characters is that of Rollergirl, portrayed by the uninhibited and highly under-rated Heather Graham.As the film progresses, you get caught up in all the characters and wonder how each one will end up (at 2\u00bd hours there's definetely enough time to change your mind). The club scenes where Wahlberg, Moore and Graham get down with their bad selves and \"boogie\" are particularly entertaining, and whether you like porn or not (there's plenty of it here) there is something undeniably attracting about \"Boogie Nights\" - something even the most prudish can't deny. 9/10",

From the beginning it is clear, that it is going to be a \"rise and fall\"-type of film, and I think the biggest fault of the film is, that the \"rise\"-part is too long. Sure it captures a lot of seventies-atmosphere, but at length it gets boring, until the last part of the film finally saves the day. The anarchistic end of the movie is in many ways a parallel to that of Raging Bull - the star who - no longer a star - refuses to realize, that he's finished.

            "content": "\"Boogie Nights\" is that remarkable achievement, a depiction of particularly ugly goings on made singularly watchable through vibrant direction and the sheer likability of an endearing cast. It's a sort of secular \"Pilgrim's Progress\" in which we follow the journey of Eddie, a high school dropout and dish-washing nobody to the heights of porn film acting by virtue of his super well-endowed cock, then to the depths as both he and his associates mess their lives up during a period of decline in their industry to a finale that gives just a little peek at their recovery. Clearly influenced by Scorsese (all those exhilarating tracking shots in and out of rooms in single takes) and Altman (the skillful manoeuvring of a large cast), Paul Thomas Anderson has fashioned a great ensemble piece that cleverly balances comedy and violence in a way that is genuinely funny in spite of the often shocking happenings. Burt Reynolds brilliantly plays Jack Horner the porn king who gathers into his entourage a troupe of grotesques that continuously delight. Particularly lovable are Rollergirl who never takes her skates off even when having sex, Julianne Moore who plays the motherly dope addict actress Amber and a remarkably young Philip Seymour Hoffman as the cuddly queer cameraman Scotty who has a crush on Eddie. When Eddie eventually f***s things up by rounding on benefactor Jack, our eyes are cleverly drawn away from the two main foreground protagonists to a distraught Scotty in a background group of onlookers. It's a wonderfully perceptive moment in a film full of small wonders and sometimes greater ones as when Eddie drinking with Jack and another friend, all half immersed in a vat of water at a party declares his chosen stage name to be Dirk Diggler. \"I think heaven has sent you here, Dirk Diggler. I think the angels have blessed us all because of you\" declares Jack. It is an almost spiritual cry of joy, the climax of what is for Anderson clearly a creative labour of love.",

Among a number of potentially interesting sidelines which go nowhere are a paedophilia strand and a male co-worker who drunkenly kisses Dirk Diggler. A lot of fairly famous faces appear but are underused.Some scenes are not convincing such as the very contrived confrontation between Diggler and Jack (excellently played by Reynolds) leads to Diggler's prolonged bout of ostracism from the porn family. And there is a strange vacillation between comedy and brutal reality. For instance, the graphic William Macy shooting scene is followed not long after by a video tape sequence in which Diggler refers to Napoleon as king of the Roman Empire, an example of stupidity which Diggler does not exhibit elsewhere. These scenes seem to come from two different films. The scene in which Don Cheatle is the sole survivor in a bizarre robbery and ends up with the cash also strikes me as implausible at least in this contest. Boogie Nights does manage to capture some of the mood of the times in these video tape sequence, but certain details elsewhere do not ring true, such as the presence of silicon implants (too early in 1980 surely?).",

This movie achieves its goal of showing the careless lives of these people. It does not stress you with many problems, fights and whatever, it just gives a careless vibe of the reckless 70's and 80's.The story might look quite blatant and not really that grasping, but the vibe this film has makes you not care about the story or how good or bad it actually is, it feels different. The first half of the film is more centered around the porn industry and Dirk's success doing what he loves, but the other half is all about character development and barely touches on the porn industry. So all those people who pass up watching this movie just because they dislike porn or porn industry, should know it is not all about porn and is a lot more likable than you might think.

Hands down my favorite film because of its impeccable sense of humor and ability to shape characters in a short amount of time. P.T. Anderson grabs pop culture and jams it down the throat of reality, all the while using the porn industry as a backdrop for a very dysfunctional \"family\" of different people. It's hard not to feel sorry for Little Bill when his wife sleeps with other men, or for poor Scotty, whose confusion and lustfulness has been felt by every human being at some point in time. But the real star performances come from Burt Reynolds and Don Cheadle. I'm not a Reynolds fan, but he is stellar in a very complex role. He's a porno visionary who loves the people he works with but also is driven by his desire to make great movies. Cheadle is the oft-rejected Buck Swope, whose shady past limits his ultimate dream to open a record store. It's pointless to name all the funny little exchanges, but there are enough to keep the film on an off-kilter journey towards oblivion (a.k.a. the 1980s). Some of the best lines come from the secondary characters such as Luis Guzman, Philip Baker Hall (\"I like simple things...) and Todd (Thomas Jane) who turns in a great performance as a frustrated, cocaine-driven small-time criminal. Forget Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch for five minutes, and you'll also realize Mark Wahlberg as a strong actor. Same goes for John C. Reilly, who is underrated and brilliant as a less-attractive porno star and Dirk Diggler sidekick. The film is simply great on every level, and the originality cannot be disputed.",

            "content": "I remember seeing Boogie nights when it first hit the theaters. I was blown away and absolutely fell in love with this movie. To begin, we all have reasons why we like and dislike movies. For that respective reason i will not criticize anyone's review since they all tend to of a personal nature. Much like the reasons i like Boogie Nights is due to the personal way it hit home with my childhood memories and how effectively it registered as truthful and vivid recollections of my youth. Having grown up as an adolescent in the late 70's and early 80's I can relate to Boogie nights that would be hard for me to explain to those who didn't experience them in my eyes. Boogie Nights is a masterpiece. Not only does it represent the desperate human nature of people yearning to be accepted, loved and appreciated, but it also captures the wasteful time of American history where some people actually earned a living without ever doing anything of any value. The 70's for young adults was when some people abandoned any sense of social responsibility. Being a morally upstanding person was disrespected and regarded as uncool, because being risqu\u00e9, daring and promiscuous was en vogue. As decadent as Anderson presents his characters and the sleazy lives these people lead it is apparent that he shows his characters as people who believe in themselves and their self delusion. Anderson doesn't judge his characters, but rather makes them very real.Boogie Nights is fun and exciting to watch. The story never lags. Anderson uses great angles, jump-cuts and effective usage of popular songs of that era for ambiance. It looks kitschy, slick and vibrantly paced. At 2.5 hours it seems to fly by.Why is it cool to like this movie? For those who can appreciate the period and setting that the story takes place is enough to draw your attention. The characters are also oddly interesting if even completely despicable. The humor is also good when it is harsh as well as uncomfortable. it's also a historical representation of the 70's that beautifully depicts the mentality of people in that time. People were far less socially aware of their faults, hangups and personal flaws back then. Today, we still have decadence and immorality in all of its numerous forms, but at least social media has kept us in check. The younger generation of today is far more informed and reminded on a daily basis the consequences of their actions. In the 70's, being promiscuous and drug addicted was upheld in pop-culture and used to separate the hip from the square by means of peer pressure. In post Y2K America we have learned the ills and setbacks of such a lifestyle and how that leads to self destruction, STD and pain.Why is it not cool to like Boogie Nights? All the characters in this movie are sad and damaged people. They are the losers of society who have chosen a soulless and hideous lifestyle devoid of any positive or meaningful aspirations. Their goals are short-term and have repulsively unsatisfying outcomes. They are all bottom-feeders who have clung together under the patriarch, Jack Horner. Exploitation, moral decay, human desperation, addiction and promiscuity are themes explored in Boogie Nights. This movie serves as a human and historical lesson. Don't watch this movie thinking you want to emulate any of these people, because you should react on the contrary. Yes, the movie does a great job with acting, plot development and authenticity. The purpose it should serve is that what a parable or Biblical story does.",

Armed with dozens of well-chosen songs and wonderfully garish costumes that perfectly complement the production design, Anderson deftly balances the huge cast, giving each of the excellent performers their chance to shine.  Ensemble casting often shortchanges the supporting characters, but nearly every person in orbit around Dirk Diggler gets a defining moment or series of moments.

I find this to be a very interesting subject as I don't think it's been done before this movie, also because one never stops to think about what the people in this kind business are like once the cameras stop rolling. This movie is a study in character development and relies heavily on the acting by all parties involved, who succeed admirably. Although this movie was not a big blockbuster hit, mostly due to the subject nature, I assume, this is a great movie none the less on a subject we don't often think about. Many have copied this movie, but few have managed to capture the feel of it.",

It captures just how tawdry and explotive these films were with many of the porn cast sincerely believing that they were \"actors,\" and no just porn machines. Next, how many appreciate how what I think is a marvelously effective score the movie has?  Many scores in movies are superfluous, even unwanted, but not this one.  It adds to the actions displayed in a way that heightens that superbly heightens them.  For example, the bells in one of the later sequences of scenes starting with Dirk getting in to a car to pitifully earn a few bucks.  Or the penultimate scene in the house where the boys go to sell some talcum powder as cocaine. The rock music, although not really a part of a superimposed score, blasts at us to the point where we want to scream, \"Turn that damned stuff off.\"  When it finally is shut off, what a great relief.  This technique I found in some Spike Lee movies, particularily Jungle Fever, although I'm sure other have noticed it in different films too.",

Boogie nights is one of these enjoyable, partly documentary, partly \"well build story\" type of movie, where you can just sit back and really get a feel of the era representing it. The biggest credit goes to director (P.T. Anderson), who has picked the right actors. Always sexy Heather Graham, surprisingly talented Mark Wahlberg and all the others. Well done. Beside that, there is a great music theme that really gets you in (funky) 70's mood. In it's genre is certainly classic and a movie you'll most probably like to return to. 7 out of 10...well almost 8:)",

            "review_title": "The Greatest film about porn",
            "content": "Perhaps the greatest story about the porn industry ever committed to a motion picture? Probably. In Boogie Nights, a movie filled with outstanding performances and pop culture for days, Paul Thomas Anderson shows us a movie in which he is truly and utterly in control of. Every single shot in this 2 and a half hour celebration of excess exists for a purpose and Anderson shows us his skill as a director. Like I said, it is a film filled with great performances, but really outstanding work from Mark Wahlberg in a truly committed performance. The movie delivers in a great use of music, filled with popular songs of the 70s and 80s and an amazing use of volume in the music (when to make it louder, quieter).All of this brings me to the ultimate flaw of Boogie Nights. There is a fine line between paying homage to a certain movie or a director and for a while, Boogie Nights rides this line with Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas. But after about the first half of the film, Anderson bluntly just rips off Scorsese. The story in itself is essentially a Goodfellas remake. A story about a young man joining a frowned upon business, starting from nothing, the film explores the inner workings of this business and we see it through the eyes of our main character (fish out of water) and we see his rise and ultimate fall through addiction and excess caused by the very business he started out in. In Goodfellas, it's organized crime. In Boogie Nights, it is the porn industry. Of course, there have been several movies to use the cookie cutter provided by Scorsese's seminal film (including two by Scorsese in Casino and more recently The Wolf of Wall Street), but Anderson also copies many of the shots used by Scorsese: Many tracking shots, the snorting of the coke then rapidly zooming in on the character's face, etc. The use of music (not the songs, but its use in the film) is nearly identical. But the similarities do not stop there. Anderson goes further in copying Scorsese's technique in using almost the same film shots used in Mean Streets. And the one that was just too much for me, personally, were the parts where Mark Wahlberg talks to himself in his dressing room, then by the end of the film it's the same thing but he is now a much different person and he starts shadow boxing (right after showing his giant c**k to the audience, of course). It is literally the exact same camera positioning (or nearly identical) as in Raging Bull. Like I said, this may be purely seen as homage to many, but for me it took it a bit too far.But overall, I can't really not like this film. Sure, Scorsese's framework is used in Boogie Nights, but as its own story it is truly gripping and compelling. It's not only a movie about the porn industry in the late 70s and early 80s, but a movie about addiction, the troubles of life and overcoming them. I have to confess, even after all of the similarities, I really like Boogie Nights and it is definitely worth a watch. The movie is two and a half hours long, but it flies by because it is insanely entertaining to watch. This is a sign of a pretty good film.",

            "content": "1997 was not Oscar's best year, particularly in the Best Picture category, which consisted of three lousy movies (TITANIC, GOOD WILL HUNTING, and AS GOOD AS IT GETS) and two that were mediocre at best (THE FULL MONTY and LA CONFIDENTIAL). As it turns out one of the lousy ones won, while one of the best pictures made that year unaccountably failed to even make the nominees list. I am referring to Paul Thomas Anderson's brilliant, no-holds-barred, and unflinchingly frank look at a \"family\" of pornographers (everyone from the producer to the stars to the film crew gets face time here) from the days when \"adult films\" were made with actual film and often financed by organized crime to the legal but undoubtedly cheesier days of direct-to-video movies.While this is mostly an ensemble piece, the central figure is Eddie Adams (Mark Wahlberg, sensational here), a slightly dim-witted young man with a huge \"endowment\" who attracts the attention of porn producer Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds in perhaps his best performance since DELIVERANCE) and is soon a member of Horner's company, renamed \"Dirk Diggler\" and bearing more than a passing resemblance to the late John Holmes.Anderson makes big movies, and they tend to run long; this one takes a little over two-and-a-half hours to tell its story, but there isn't a frame of wasted film here; this is an exciting, involving, and utterly fascinating film from start to finish. Even if you find the subject matter objectionable, you will not be able to deny the power Anderson brings to every moment of this film.The ensemble deserves mention here as well, because this is a film loaded with some of the best character actors in the business and every performance has greatness in it. One of my particular favorite scenes is a cocaine-fueled stream-of-consciousness dialogue between porn actresses Amber Waves (Julianne Moore) and Rollergirl (Heather Graham) that is as harrowing as a train wreck and quite as impossible to avoid looking at.There is a lot of other great talent on hand here: Luis Guzm\u00e1n as an aspiring producer; Don Cheadle as an aspiring porn actor with the peculiar quirk of dressing in cowboy outfits that make him look more like BLAZING SADDLES material than a porn star; William H Macy as a member of the crew whose wife (Nina Hartley) enjoys \"doing it\" with every available male whether or not the cameras are turning, and a slightly stereotypical but nonetheless compelling turn by Phillip Seymour Hoffman as a gofer with a major crush on both Dirk and his \"sidekick\" and frequent costar Reed Rothchild (John C Reilly); and two brilliant cameos: Joanna Gleason as Eddie/Dirk's hateful mother, and Alfred Molina as a highly-placed drug dealer whom Dirk and Reed make an abortive attempt to rob, nearly losing their lives in the process.This is a great film, rich in both form and content. There isn't a bad performance or a single scene that fails to hit the mark in the entire movie, and if you haven't seen it yet, I urge you to get it. It is proof that great movies are still possible even in this day and age when we are drowning in remakes and silly action pictures.Final note: the most interesting and compelling thing about this film is that Anderson makes no judgment calls about his characters. He shows them for who they are, the good, the bad, and the in-between, giving the film a depth that is rare in Hollywood.A work of genius.",

Paul Thomas Anderson fails on both counts.  The movie opens with a very long panning sequence, but besides getting us acquainted with some of the characters, the camera's movement lacks any deeper meaning than that Anderson wanted to see if he could do it.  This would be fine, if the rest of the movie had this same gliding, spinning spirit about it, but Anderson has chosen a darker, more cynical approach.  He doesn't judge the people he creates, but he doesn't really know how to tell a story about them, either.  He is reaching for new insights about the porn industry, but the only times he avoids its banality is when he catches the humor in the situation.  And this doesn't happen too often.  Only the marginal characters have any freshness to them; John C. Reilly, Don Cheadle, and Philip Seymour Hoffman shine.  The principals--Mark Wahlberg, Burt Reynolds, Julianne Moore, and Heather Graham--are dim, and porn stars that I've ever seen in interviews have a sharpness and resilience that they lack.  The women in this business are tough and clever.  If they ever are maternal like Moore is, it's not evident on camera, and only the pretentious ones harbor thoughts of being filmmakers.  For this movie to touch anything close to greatness, it would need to be more comic in tone or go all the way with its sights on the dark side. Instead it chooses to remain somewhere in between, and the sensual promise of \"Spill The Wine\" overflows in vain.  What a waste!",

The film's tag-line rings very true, saying everyone has something useful.  Diggler's something happened to be very marketable back in the late-'70's madness that was the porn industry.  Aside from this, the film must be looked at as a slice-of-life, historical document because of how sex is portrayed and thought of then and now.  Porn, of course, is still booming.

And they don't come much bigger than Eddie Adams (Wahlberg), discovered by Horner working in a nightclub: with his massive schlong and enviable sexual prowess, he is a natural. As Dirk Diggler, Eddie quickly becomes an industry legend, but with success comes excess, which leads to the young porn-star making some dangerous choices that almost cost him his life.A thoroughly engrossing tale of decadence and corruption, Boogie Nights is a superbly crafted film in virtually every area: the script is gritty, witty, poignant and shocking, brimming with unforgettable characters and sparkling dialogue; the superb period detail and wonderful soundtrack effortlessly transport the viewer to the carefree pre-AIDS days of the late '70s/early '80s; the stellar supporting cast\u2014which includes William H.

The previews look OK, perhaps even funny, the cast seems attractive, but overall you simply cannot imagine a movie about pornography will be very good. Well, you would be wrong.  Boogie Nights is quite simply one of the best films of the 90s, and definitely one of the best period pieces I have ever seen.  Given the 70s and 80s were not that long ago, but writers and director really demonstrate a reasonable understanding of not only the porn industry, but the societal changes that turned it into a profitable business.While Boogie Nights does not seem to glorify pornography in any way, it also does not fall into moralizing mode and become an indictment of the people of the industry.  Most of characters managed to expand beyond their conventions and become living, breathing creatures.  Wahlberg is phenomenal in this film, surprisingly so, he really brings a sense of pathos to an otherwise stupid and unsympathetic character.  The scene where his mother is taunting him and ripping his posters down is genuinely moving in a wierd sort of way (although she is not ultimately wrong).Most of the characters are equally as complex and engaging and the plot is beautifully done and ends on a rather strange kind of upbeat.  Overall, I would advise this film to anyone who was genuinely interested in the 70s or 80s, and to people who have sort of an off-beat sense of art.

The overall story deals with the successes that the characters enjoy within their own secluded little world of adult films . . . and the failures they encounter when they dare to reach for more.  The rest of the world views them as perverts, as criminals . . . or, worst of all, as pathetic jokes, which probably hurts most of all.The ensemble cast of `Boogie Nights' is nothing short of awesome.  Mark Wahlberg is Dirk Diggler (loosely based on the real adult film star John Holmes), a man endowed with a rather large gift \u0096 unfortunately, it isn't a brain.  He puts in a great performance as a very earnest, self-deluded guy who hasn't the faintest idea how to deal with his own success.  Frankly, I'm amazed he wasn't nominated for an Oscar for this role, and I never thought I'd ever say that about a guy who used to call himself Marky Mark.  Julianne Moore is terrific as Amber Waves, the porn starlet who acts as a mother figure to the other people (particularly the men) in her films.  William H. Macy is pathetically funny and tragic as Little Bill, and Phillip Seymour Hoffman is excellent as Scotty, the production guy who hangs out with these porn stars as his sad little way of being close to fame.  Don Cheadle, John C. Reilly, Heather Graham, (even Nina Hartley, an actual porn actress!). . . the list of knockout performances goes on and on.  I'd also be remiss if I failed to mention Burt Reynolds' turn as Jack Horner, the porn producer who likes to think he's making quality films for the masses.  Watching Reynolds in this film put in a quiet, understated performance without his typical mugging or hamming it up for the camera was a real treat, a remind of why Reynolds was once considered a truly great actor.Director P.T. Anderson is clearly a fan of Robert Altman and Martin Scorsese \u0096 their influences show up not only in how Anderson deals with an ensemble cast, but in his choices of sweeping camera shots, of music, and how he often chooses to unfold his story.  That's okay, because he also manages to take those influences and make something quite original \u0096 and very gut-wrenching. `Boogie Nights' is a marvelous tale.  Watch it.  A",

Along with David Fincher and Danny Boyle, he's most certainly the best director to immerge from that hard decade for film. Pardon the clich\u00e9 but `this is a must see for film lovers', the script is amazing, the performances are stunning, a plot to die for, excellent soundtrack, editing and the cinematography is mind blowing. Throughout the film Anderson puts a whole new meaning to the word steady cam, he uses it to great effect and again and again, meanwhile we sit there and go \"wow\". And the main thing is that he's not trying to over stylise the film just for the hell of it, like Guy Richie or even David Fincher with Fight Club. Each shot is meticulously planned with the audience in mind as well as the films narrative, enabling us to dig deeper into the characters in the film that struggle to find dignity in their lives. One particular shot in the film that I favour is when the camera holds close up on Mark Wahlberg's character for about a minute, intensifying the situation and enabling us to relate with his character. Ultimately this is a film about humans, people being people, something that we can all relate to, watch and enjoy. Of course there is the language, violence and sex scenes, so it wouldn't be suitable for younger viewers but I don't see any other reason why anyone should miss out on a marvellous piece of cinema. And if you enjoy this then check out his other films Hard Eight and the three hours masterpiece Magnolia, which he should have, without a doubt, won best director for.

This film, in some sense, follows the same very basic story as Hard Eight, Magnolia, and Punch-Drunk Love:Person (or people) begins in normal life, but something unusual happens triggering either a change, or at least deviation from normal behavior. There is this buildup of good events; it looks like things could only get better and better, but there is something obviously wrong going on. Something bad happens, and then begins the descent into hell. But, suddenly, there is an event that causes things to suddenly become perfect. And the hero goes back to life, but not as it was; he still has his experiences.Dirk Diggler's speech-to-the-mirror in the end really seals this sort of plot pattern in the end.

            "content": "Boogie Nights isn't really an incisive look into the world of pornography. Instead it's more of a point and laugh comedy. Look at these idiots, the film seems to be saying. Look at what losers they are. You knock one out to these people. Therefore the film has kind of a smug tone to it, one that eschews real depth.The reason why I don't really feel for the characters in Boogie Nights isn't because they're messed up or because they're in porn, but because they're all so overwhelmingly stupid. Not one has a brain in their head. The best example is Reed Rothchild (he's even stupider than the monumentally brainless Dirk Diggler). He talks about bodybuilding, he does inane magic tricks, he recites awful poetry and his attempts at acting are cringe worthy. In fact, I'm convinced that John C. Reilly is having a laugh. Have a look at the way he makes a Bruce Forsyth pose when he's in the background in a restaurant scene in a Brock Landers film. And just look at him dancing when Dirk is strangling the cat in the music studio. It's a performance that is fun (it cracks me up) but it's not one that is grounded in reality. Consequently I can't feel anything for the character.And the same is true with Dirk Diggler. I can enjoy the performance and I can enjoy his story, but not for one second do I sympathise with him. He's just too dumb.Dirk's colossal stupidity is well established from the beginning. His mother rightly tells her half-wit son that he's stupid. Dirk, though, wrongly states that he isn't. Right from the start he's deluded. But his delusion continues to progress as the film develops. First he wants a name so sharp that neon signs will explode. Then he wants to make porn films with a story. And by the end he wants to make music. You can't feel for a man this thick. You can only squirm and laugh as he's reduced to whacking off in car parks. He's a loser.But the rise and fall (and rise again?) is fun to watch. One of my favourite scenes has to be his first porn shoot. There's a lot of funny stuff in there (\"How long has it been since you've had a woman?\" \"A long time.\" \"That's terrible.\") but nothing can quite supplant the atrocity that is Dirk's come face. It looks like he's got an itch in his brain that he's trying to scratch by rhythmically scrunching his eyes. And then you've got Dirk as Brock Landers. Every frame in his film is comedy gold. You've got his mullet, his cap gun, him slipping before he does some karate moves, the badly choreographed fight and the actual dialogue in the film itself:\"I could die of starvation.\" \"Still hungry?\" \"Starving.\" \"Why don't you feast on that?\" \"Okay.\" (Pause.) \"Oh it's true.\" \"What's that?\" \"You are Brock Landers.\" (Chug.)But I also like it when Dirk becomes a drug-addled mess. Suddenly he thinks he's an artist. He's talking about helping marriages and he's taking sole credit for the films. And then later on he's dictating terms to the director. The man's a fool. His meltdown elicits nothing but cackles \u0096 I particularly like the way he tries to karate chop the boss at the record studio.However, Dirk and Reed aren't the only imbeciles. There are plenty to go around. There's Scotty, the gay crew member who has a crush on donkey boy. There's Amber, the junkie who's lost her family. There's Little Bill, the pathetic cuckold. And there's Buck, the black country and western fan. But I do have to say, of the characters in the film, these four, as dense as they are, do garner a little bit of sympathy \u0096 they're slightly more well-rounded than Dirk. I certainly feel somewhat for Buck who wants to escape his porn past and start a legitimate business. He actually comes across as something of a human being. Ditto for Amber. And although Little Billy is overwhelmingly pathetic \u0096 grow a set of balls, man \u0096 Macy is a good enough actor to give the character a bit of depth. But the problem that the film has is that most of the time is spent with Dirk, and while its fun watching him mangle a Transformers song, most of the film is mocking in tone. As a result its pleasures are slightly more superficial than they could have been (just because the people are superficial, doesn't mean that the film has to be).And the film also suffers a little because it apes Scorsese (particularly Goodfellas). You've got the long steadicam shots, the whip pans and the heavy reliance on the music of the period. Technically it's near faultless, but it never feels particularly original. Indeed, the scene where Dirk apologises to Jack feels like a carbon copy of the scene in Goodfellas where Henry apologises to Paulie. And Dirk's coked up meltdown (which culminates in the amusing scene with Alfred Molina) feels almost identical to Henry Hill's. But although it's not quite as good as it could have been, it's still a very enjoyable film. And even though the characters are idiots, it says something for the film that the almost universal happy ending leaves you feeling satisfied (only the pederast investor gets an unhappy ending). But having said that, is Dirk going back to porn really a happy ending? Well, considering it's the only thing he's competent at (his come face prevents me from saying that he's good at it), I guess he should be grateful.And one last thing, this is the only film where Heather Graham has been properly cast. With a great rack and non-existent acting talent, she makes a convincing porn star.",

            "content": "Boogie Nights is a surprisingly good drama that deals with one man's rise and fall in the adult film industry. Mark Wahlberg delivers one of the best performances of his career as Eddie Adams, the young man who is spotted at his job as a busboy by porn filmmaker Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds), and who changes his name to Dirk Diggler, the newest and temporarily most popular porn star in the business. Wahlberg even managed to make the screaming, emotional scene very convincing, which is the type of scene that is almost always screwed up (see about 90% of Chasing Amy). Evidently, Horner's dream is to make an adult film that has a good story, and literally sucks the audience into it. Maybe there should have been some debate about whether or not that was possible, or necessary (who goes to see a porno for the story?), but it doesn't matter that there wasn't. The 1970s are very realistically created, in every way from the outfits to the disco soundtrack to the god-awful interior decorating. Heather Graham is also very convincing as Rollergirl, the high school girl who flunks out of school and works in the adult film industry as well. This, by the way, is one of the roles that makes her performance in Lost In Space totally unconvincing and impossible to take seriously. Poor William H. Macy plays one of his traditional, unenviable roles. Why does this guy always get awful parts in his movies?  This poor guy's wife is constantly cheating on him (in some cases, in the middle of a circle of gaping, nearly comatose people), and she clearly has no respect for him. And to make matters worse, being in the porn industry, no one seems to understand what his conflict is.\n(spoilers) The majority of the film deals with the business aspect of adult films \u0096 everything from the hiring to the shooting to the big money and drugs and the awards ceremonies. While this aspect of the film was very well done, as was Dirk's eventual fall from celebrity status, there were a lot of things about the movie that were either very badly presented or just didn't make any sense. For example, near the end, when the donut shop gets robbed, the robber walks in with a gun and pays all of his attention to the black guy in the nice white suit while he's robbing the store, completely ignoring the rough looking redneck with the hunting magazine that was sitting in a nearby booth. And then, after all of them have ingeniously shot each other to death, Cheadle's character grabs the paper bag full of money off the floor and runs. Evidently, he didn't see the recent film A Lesson Before Dying (in which he starred), which was about a black guy in the 1940s who did that exact same thing and then faced murder charges in a heavily racist society. And then there is the scene where Dirk and a couple of his buddies go out to sell a large quantity of fake drugs to a big time drug dealer with the intent of robbing him (in a scene, by the way, where Sister Christian is playing, which is Marilyn Manson's favorite song). What the hell was going on in that scene?! There was some half naked Chinese kid walking around and casually lighting off dozens of fireworks in the freakin' house! This was one of the things about this movie that made no sense whatsoever and just should not have been there. Overall, despite numerous weaknesses, Boogie Nights is a very good film that is miraculously able to live up to all of the expected notoriety that it developed, given such facts as that Heather Graham gets naked in the movie and, of course, that infamous, groan inducing final scene. Ironically, I think that the film deserves extra praise because they had enough nerve to make a film about a topic that is not generally accepted by society. The thing that really makes Boogie Nights succeed is that it is based on reality. It's not attempting to use the nudity or the subject matter to pull along a weak script. All of the big porn stars eventually fall from stardom, and return to small and unappealing occupations. And the occasional pedophile winds up exactly where he belongs \u0096 in prison getting slapped around and treated like a bitch by a huge black man. Paul Thomas Anderson wrote and directed a film about the porn industry, which is one of the most hated industries in the world, and the film that resulted is not only informative about the workings of that industry, but also very entertaining.",

            "review_title": "Perhaps the most touching analysis of the porn industry ever made",
            "content": "In one of this film's most crucial scenes, porn director Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds) explains that his aim is to make an adult picture with a story that's compelling enough to keep the audience focused on the plot and not just the hardcore sex scenes. He wants to move the viewers, rather than arouse them. That sequence neatly sums up what Paul Thomas Anderson has achieved with his second feature, the stunning, oddly heartbreaking Boogie Nights.Set between 1977 and 1984, the picture tells us how lives can change thanks to the adult film industry: it is the golden years of porn cinema, and Jack Horner is the most successful filmmaker in that sector. He gets particularly lucky when he meets Eddie Adams (Mark Wahlberg), a 17-year old waiter with an unusually large manhood. After a night of drinks and sex in Jack's house, the young man happily accepts to become his new star, and the results show pretty quickly: Dirk Diggler, as he is now known, is the hottest name in the business, which means he can get whatever he wants, whether it's a fast car, nice clothes, ladies or drugs.Such \"happiness\", however, is not meant to last: being a porn star might change your life, but \"change\" does not necessarily mean \"improve\". The trouble starts when Floyd Gondolli (Philip Baker Hall) tells Jack the future of the industry is videotape, meaning there is no more need for professionals. As is that weren't enough, most of the cast and crew have problems of their own: Jack's leading lady, Amber Waves (Julianne Moore), is in the middle of a bitter custody battle with her ex-husband; Rollergirl (Heather Graham) is uncertain about what to do with her life; occasional collaborator Buck Swope (Don Cheadle) has trouble finding a real job; producer Little Bill (William H. Macy) has to deal with his adulterous wife. But the biggest liability is Dirk: filled with drugs and having an ego the size of his \"torpedo\" (\"It's my big d*ck and I say when we roll!\"), he and his partner Reed Rothchild (John C. Reilly) make increasingly dangerous \"business\" deals with the wrong people, slowly making him realize super-stardom isn't that glamorous after all.On a technical level, Anderson gets more ambitious than he was while making his first film, Sydney, and delivers a flawless exercise in style with echoes of Scorsese (the beautiful opening tracking shot, the expert use of music), Altman (the brilliant handling of an ensemble cast, especially in the swimming pool sequence) and Tarantino (some of the characters and the dialogue, plus the off-screen violence). But what impresses the most is how he succeeds in getting a touching story out of an unconventional subject: rather than offering a two-hour montage of explicit sex (there are only two such scenes in the entire film) he focuses on the people involved in the making of this kind of flicks, with particular attention to how their lives are affected by what they do. Those expecting naked bodies are watching the wrong film: this is a chronicle of the experiences of flawed human beings in a peculiar context. Despite the premise, the movie is less interested in hardcore material than it is in the characters: layered, real and affecting, not to mention played by one of the finest ensemble casts in history (the standouts being Reynolds, Moore and Wahlberg), they are the real selling point of Anderson's poignant opus.Sex has always been used as a tool to tell stories. This film's greatness lies in taking that tool, using it to establish the setting, context and characters and then throwing it out of the window: Boogie Nights is not about sex, nor was it ever meant to be. It is a picture about life, loneliness and suffering, and that's what makes it one of the finest movies of 1997.",

            "content": "From writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson (Magnolia, There Will Be Blood), this might have looked like a really seedy film, focusing on the porn industry, but it is actually a really good portrayal of the times. Basically, in the late 1970's, high school drop out and bar worker Eddie Adams (Mark Wahlberg) is approached by adult filmmaker Jack Horner (Golden Globe winning, and Oscar and BAFTA nominated Burt Reynolds), who wants him to become his new big star. After running away from home, Edie practises a \"scene\" first with co-worker Rollergirl (Heather Graham), then he adopts the new name Dirk Diggler, and his \"talent\" is brought to the screen when he performs with Amber Waves (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Julianne Moore). After many other \"performances\", and winning three awards at the 2nd Annual Adult Film Awards, Jack and Dirk, with co-star Reed Rothchild (John C. Reilly) create a new sex-filled cop show called Brock Landers: Angels Live In My Town, which gets Horner much more notice. The cast and crew of Jack's celebrate the new year and head into the 1980's, but after seeing his wife with other men, Little Bill (William H. Macy) ends the life of his wife on the night, and then himself. One day though this success is taken away when Dirk loses his temper and flees after Jack is not ready to start filming when he is \"ready\". The various characters are now separating from Jack's world, he is trying to get a new talent off the street, Buck Swope (Don Cheadle) is trying to make it in the technology centre business with his own shop, and Dirk and Reed are getting involved with drug dealers like Rahad Jackson (Spider-Man 2's Alfred Molina). In the end though, apologies are made between Dirk and Jack, and the other characters all come back to continue the success they have lost and want back, and the film ends with Dirk finally showing us his \"big talent\". Also starring Philip Seymour Hoffman as Scotty J., Luis Guzm\u00e1n as Maurice TT Rodriguez, Philip Baker Hall as Floyd Gondolli and Tomorrow Never Dies' Ricky Jay as Kurt Longjohn. It has a really good all star cast, the script makes it not like your typical sex filled film, and the direction is marvellous, a great sex, drugs and disco filled drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Original Screenplay. It was number 26 on The 100 Greatest Sexy Moments. Very good!",

Mark Wahlberg gives a great performance as the bus boy in Torrance to the rising porn star Dirk Diggler of L.A.  All the actors were very good but this film really belongs to Burt Reynolds who gave a tour-de-force performance as Jack Horner. For this being Burt's greatest performance, he got royally screwed by the academy.  Like Robin Williams was THAT good in \"Good Will Hunting\". P.T. Anderson who did the equally good \"Hard Eight\", has great poise and energy in his writing. How could you every forget a name like Dirk Diggler?  \"Boogie Nights\" in my book was the best film in 1997 and is near a masterpiece to me.  Others will find it boring, disturbing, gross, whatever, the point is, that this is a film that people are going to remember for years.  P.T. is a breakthrough talent who in more years to come will be giving us more interesting films and this man will win an Oscar some day. Mark my words!",

            "content": "I've seen 2 other movies by P.T. Anderson, Magnolia and There will be blood. All three are brilliantly crafted but disturbingly empty while the story lingers on and revels in distressing characters. So my opinion is P.T. Anderson should not write and be content with directing movies. As such it feels like a man-who-thinks-he-is-an-artist's work, with a lot of self-indulgence for the subject matter, and very little substance.In Boogie Nights the pornography business is seen as a nice family, with some occasional violence and an increasing drug consumption. Actually it could have been about a rock band or small time drug dealers. The pornography industry may be fascinating from the outside but it is more about people living from day to day and is thus not the least interesting, especially with the un-gritty look and feel P.T. Anderson gives his movie.Poor boy Dirk Diggler and his friends are neither bad nor nice, nor clean, not dirty. What they do has no meaning (sure, they are living from day to day) and they learn nothing, build nothing. OK some just happen to suddenly disappear in the process while one of them eventually gets a wife, a baby and the money to settle a 'real' business. Nobody's saved, nobody's doomed, everybody is just normal people: who cares about a movie like that? It is just episode after episode, starting 1977 and ending 1984, a patchwork of anecdotes making up for a story: style shall never be an excuse.",

            "content": "All the characters are in the porn business. But this movie isn't really about porn, it's about family, and we care about all of the family members. Every single one of them - from the main players down to the supporting ones played by the likes of Don Cheadle, William Macy, John C Reilly and Heather Graham. These are interesting people every moment they are on screen. Since they deal in skin flicks, all they have is each other to lean on as the outside world turns their backs on them.It's a testament to the actors, under the sure hand of Paul Thomas Anderson, that everyone is so compelling. Julianne Moore, one of my favourite actors, is sympathetic and heartbreaking as Amber Waves. Mark Whalberg, former rapper and model, who was ridiculed when he decided to get into acting, successfully shows the long journey of a lost boy desperately trying to matter. Technically, the film is vivid and interesting in its depiction of the 70's and 80's, plus it has consistently inventive camera work.The relationship between the characters, and what they do for a living is explored with patience, subtlety, breadth and depth. There are no saints or sinners but people just trying to get by. As we start in the 70's and move to the 80's (memorably), each character has to adapt to a world and industry that is moving away from what they have always known. Overall this movie just feels so authentic, speaking volumes over many other under-baked films. But despite the praise I've heaped on it, it isn't a classic. I didn't feel restless during the 2 and a 1/2 hour running time but by the end you feel that there are things left unsaid. A little too much is left open. I'm not just talking about a lack of resolution to the characters' story lines but a lack of resolution of the themes that Anderson has been juggling all along. Less is more to be sure, and the future of the characters is clearly in the balance, but they are all so closely linked in situation and destiny that there seems to be a definite way to end the film that wasn't tapped into. This lack of conclusive unity makes the film seem more bloated and over-baked.Put another way, the weaknesses in the film are magnified in Anderson's next film after this one - 'Magnolia.' 'Magnolia' was so long and had so many story lines that its impact was severely muted. It felt Robert Altman (rip) light. Anderson exercises a lot more control in 'Boogie Nights' and its definitely worth seeing if you like meaty and dramatic films that makes sure the little details are taken care of as well as the big ones. There's sex, drugs and violence but its not gratuitous.",

We watch Eddie transform from a simple good-hearted busboy to the biggest star of the adult cinema industry, with all the money, women and drugs that come with that fame. The movie ends with the predictable moral that taking yourself too seriously leads to failure, as we watch all of the actor-characters sink into their own personal hells, as they mistake their fame and money for personal talent and success, only to realize too late that they're being consumed by the business that feeds their instant gratification. Burt Reynolds is excellent as the father figure director who is the center of the group of porn actors he recruits. Bill Macy turns in his usual great performance in a small role as the cinematographer whose wife (played by Nina Hartley, as an inside joke to all the porn fans in the audience!) can't stop having very public sex with other men, every chance she gets.",

No what I mean is he becomes adult entertainment star Dirk Diggler. Under the direction of Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds) he becomes a top porn star.The film isn't a porn fest rather it shoes the rapid rise of Diggler and the equally rapid fall due to drug misuse and age as the film focuses on the 1980s. Featuring an excellent soundtrack of my childhood including the likes of 99 Red Balloons! The cast is quite good including the already mentioned Wahlberg and Reynolds. Julianne Moore, the late Philip Seymour Hoffman and William H. Macy who suffers a shocking end to the 1970s.Directed by young filmmaker Paul Thomas Anderson the 155 minute runtime is enjoyable.",

We see the kind of life Eddie lives with his parents.His mother represents the kind of parent that he probably wouldn't like to live with being that their relationship is not so mother and son.The only father Eddie(Dirk Diggler) has is the man who has caused him to be a sensation.Burt Reynolds plays the filmmaker who would rather shoot his films on film rather than video.Burt Reynolds was recognized with an academy award nomination for best supporting actor.From what I heard he was ignored of a nomination for \"Deliverance\" due to a centerfold he did.I do not know if that's a rumor or not but it was not a rumor when he finally got his respect in the form of an Oscar nomination.Watching this film was like playing with a bag of mixed emotions.\"Boogie Nights\" is also on the goodside due to it's performances by Don Cheadle(\"Rush Hour2\",'Family Man\" and \"Traffic\"),Julianne Morre and Heather Graham.The film had certain points that irritated me.I was never fond of the 70s or early 80s which is why I was blocking my ears on the way home listening to that Rick Springfield song \"Jessie's Girl\" in my head.That took me back into a time that I did not want to go into.The 70s to me were dull but then I was a kid.But I was old enough to look around and see for myself and watching \"Boogie Nights\" was like opening a door that was meant to be locked.\"Boogie Nights\" is not a bad film.it has great performances and a decent story but the film gave me to many mixed emotions.What can you say about a film that confuses you like that?Roger Ebert gave this film **** which means that he really enjoyed it.I am not Roger Ebert so my opinion is this:Everone has their own opinions.Only problem with my opinion is it zig zags in different directions because of this film.\"Boogie Nights\" will be remembered as an important film to some people but to me,I had no idea what to think of it.",

Perhaps, we are finally urged to consider, it is metaphorical of the film or the world of Porn.  Ultimately we are left without the real answer.The only thing this distasteful concoction of a film achieves is to push the envelope of probity and civility out a bit further.  Thus, many critics and audiences have shouted, \"Brilliant,\" despite the fact that nothing is brilliant at all here.\tOnce again, we see the emotionally damaged and others of borderline intelligence trotted out and drawn to Porn, the artificial world of make-believe filmmaking.  This form of filmmaking reduces for us all the quality of life and steps on the triumph of the human spirit.

Make sure to stay tuned for the deleted scenes at the end of the special edition to get a better idea of Reilly's comic genius. Perhaps most amazing is the maturity that writer and director Anderson exhibits at such a young age. He was no more than 26 or 27 when he made this movie, yet the structure of the screenplay and his wildly entertaining style is solid and interestingly complex. He seems perfectly capable of maintaining more than a few storylines and subplots, keeping them all intriguing and spinning them out to satisfying endings.

(It was especially good to see a small part performed by real-life porn veteran, Nina Hartley).Basically this film combines comedy and tragedy with the result being one of the best films of 1997, which was snubbed at the Oscars (probably due to the \"racy\" - as they would say - subject matter, and the general conservatism of the Academy.",

            "content": "\"Eddie Adams\" (Mark Wahlberg) is a high school dropout who lives with his mother and step-father and works at a nightclub as a dishwasher. One night while working he is noticed by a man named \"Jack Horner\" (Burt Reynolds) who is a director of pornographic films and is looking for new talent. So when Jack learns that Eddie is endowed with an extremely large penis he asks Eddie to audition in front of him with an aspiring female actress named \"Rollergirl\" (Heather Graham). One thing leads to another and not long afterward Eddie has moved in with Jack, changed his name to \"Dirk Diggler\" and becomes a star in the adult film industry. Unfortunately, like everything else in this particular business, a person can only stay on top for so long and soon Eddie's pride, lack of maturity and his newly acquired cocaine habit begin to take a toll on him--and all of his colleagues as well. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that Mark Wahlberg's character is largely based on the life of John C. Holmes with a number of other lesser-known individuals and scenarios thrown in for good measure. To that effect, this was a highly acclaimed film with both Burt Reynolds and Julianne Moore (as \"Amber Waves\") being nominated for several awards for their performances including \"Best Supporting Actor\" and \"Best Supporting Actress\" respectively. Having said that, however, although I thought that this was a satisfactory film, I have to admit that it seemed a bit too long and lost its focus along the way. There were just one too many sub-plots. For that reason I have rated it accordingly.",

The film follows the film career of Dirk Digler and is apparently loosely based on the life of the porn star John Holmes. Although not quite as disturbing as 8mm this certainly shows the dangers of being sucked into the world of porn. The people that make the money from porn ruthlessly exploit the people that star in the movies. Why Burt Reynolds didn't win an oscar for his performance is a mystery. Other notable performances are turned in by Julianne Moore, Heather Graham, John C Reilly, William H Macy and Mark Wahlberg, but that isn't surprising as these are some of the finest character actors plying their trade in Hollywood. For anybody who just wants to see what all the fuss is about, just watch the last 30 seconds and apparently it's not Mark Wahlberg !",

Paul Thomas Anderson captures the very essence of the 70's. The one thing i enjoyed the most about this film was the music.

Another thing to note was that this was Paul Thomas Anderson's 2nd film and he was only 27 when this was released (25 when he wrote the script). In spite of that, this film manages to be much better made than some filmmakers twice or thrice his age. I don't really even have a problem with this movie.

But when I saw it (about one year ago) i knew at once that I had missed out on probably the greatest film of the 90`s!! I sat for two and a half hours and I was simply stunned! I cried, I laughed and when the end came I was sad. I really didn`t want it to end. First of all, I was deeply moved and touched by this film and I can`t say it enough, Mark Wahlberg is simply magnificent in this film and portrays Dirk Diggler with passion and skill. It`s really a kind of sad story and you begin to feel sorry for Dirk, but you know that he has himself to thank.The best thing about this pic maybe, is the acting. Academy Award nominee Burt Reynolds in the role of his life! Great and if nothing less, SUPERB!! Don Cheadle, Luis Guzman, Julianne Moore, Melora Walters, John C.Reilly, P.S.Hoffman, William H.Macy, Phillip Baker Hall and Heather Graham!! Every each and one of them delivers blistering performances and makes this movie unforgettable.The director/writer Paul Thomas Anderson is one of my personal favourits and i do believe he will continue to make great films in the future. His excellent style in camerawork and his intense and brilliant scripts are all known qualities. I think and I mean that he really deserved that Oscar for Best Original Screenplay!! I would already categorize P.T.Anderson as one of greatest and most promising director/writers of all time.The best movie of the 90`s and why stop there?! This movie is the best movie I have ever seen and I think it`s one of the all-time top-ten!! I give it 10/10!! So, see this movie and do not miss out on the great soundtrack that is also a strong part of the film.\"I am a big,bright,shining star\"-Dirk Diggler-",

The I got to thinking something that provoked that strong of a reaction had to be worth my time. What an understatement that is!Boogie Nights is the first film I saw that was able to combine Comedy and Drama equally and effectively. Within the first 15 minutes of the movie,(the TK421 scene) I knew two things. This wasn't going to be just another T&A flick and that it was going to be a great parody of the porn business in the 70s. When the 80s were ushered in (dramatically), I realized there was more to this film than comedy. As the final notes of what P.T. Anderson referred to as \"broken circus music\" faded, I wanted to go through the whole journey again because while watching Boogie Nights I go through the whole gamut of emotions. That is why this movie is so much more than just \"worth your time\". Finally. as kind of a side note another thing about Boogie Nights that makes it such a superior film is that it is able to employ Tarantinoesque style (hip pop culture references etc.) in a very humanistic manner. For example you won't hear Reed Rothchild say \" I just shot Dirk in the face.\" in this movie or any other PT Anderson picture for that matter. That is why I will never be disappointed or feel cheated after seeing a PT Anderson picture.",

However it seems to me that the porn industry is the main character here and everyone else is just there to assist. It bothered me because this film seemed to me like a set of good scenes that don't always have to be connected. Almost every character has a problem, it does not have its own special story with the beginning and / or the end but its only purpose is to get an insight into the second half of the seventies and the beginning of the eighties of the last century.",

If you ever rent this movie and get bored ('cause it is looooong!) hang in there because the drug deal at the end is one of the funniest moments in film history. I actually taped JUST that scene when this came on HBO a few years ago and I still have it on tape ... I can't think of any other scene in film history that's made me want to do that - wait!

But still, it's just such a great story!  Eddie's rise to stardom and the life of luxury and then his eminent downward spiral.Another aspect that most people might not notice or admire (although all movie buffs would of course) was Anderson's use of extended shots to capture many different conversations and actions going on in the same scene.  The transitions are really cool.  Sometimes I wonder how many takes it might have taken them to get just what they wanted out of a single shot.Finally the part of the film that really makes it stand out for me is the amazing use and choices of music throughout the movie.  The music really gets you into the groove of that swingin' party life of the 70's.

Well, I'd imagine that looking at porn from the 1970s and early 1980s would give the same feeling. This film is like a long, continuous reel of behind-the-scenes footage from old pornos \u0096 there are long-drawn shots, shaky and intimate camera movement and it all presents a very 'objective' view of its subject, eliminating the narrator factor in the product.It's an enjoyable product too, featuring an impressively cast all-star ensemble as the broken, bruised, decaying 'old' porn-stars, snorting coke and not really giving a damn about anything besides the art of film-making. Being a portrayal of an era rather than a plot-driven piece, there is really not much else to the story than that, unless you want to count Dirk Diggler's (Mark Wahlberg) claim to fame in the adult industry. \"Boogie Nights\" is, in spite of its upbeat title, a harrowing film that navigates the themes of decay and out-of-date values. For example, the once big-shot adult-movie director Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds) is at the height of his career when the film first zooms in on him, but toward the end he is fatally fading which culminates when a frat-boy screams at him: \"Your movies are sh it nowadays.\" He snaps, beats him up, but returns a broken man.Because the film deals with such a 'fun' subject (sex, and the porn industry) in such a tragical way, it manages funny and heartbreaking at the same time. I do not know of many other movies that accomplish this, but \"Boogie Nights\" perfects it. The scene in which a fantastically broken, defeated and soft-spoken Julianne Moore sits on the bed with Heather Graham \u0096 both high as kites, and snorting \u0096 and the latter asks her if wants to be her mom, it is a scene so harrowing and simultaneously funny that it's nearly too much to take.The best description I can give of this film is that it is a 2 and a half hours long orgy of sex, drugs and pornstars walking around in a bubble of out-of-touch values, fading fame and a life that will disappoint them. It's well-acted, occasionally poignant and often funny but ultimately it lacks too much direction and a clear sense of point. It leads me to thinking that if you strip it of its sex factor, then would people enjoy this film? For instance, if director Anderson had zoomed in on the car-selling industry during the 1970s-1980s, would we even give a damn? I doubt it.7 out of 10",

As the movie grinds into its third hour, Anderson runs out of ideas and the cracks in the characters begin to show.  Wahlberg goes from tortured to merely whiny.  A botched drug-deal subplot comes out of nowhere and Tarantinos around for awhile before going *back* to nowhere; if it weren't for the characters, you'd think it was from another movie.  My friends kept turning to me and saying \"Is it over *now?*  How about *now?*\"  Not even the sight of an obvious prosthetic in Wahlberg's fly felt like a payoff.Anderson is a wizard with visuals and excellent with casting, but needs to take a few lessons in storytelling (there is practically no plot to speak of) and work with a judicious editor.  Until then, he's merely good, with gusts up to genius.",

There are endless parties, sex, alcohol and drugs. Yes it could be very authentic, but sometimes it feels as if the plot is interspersed in between the hedonism. Not that there is anything wrong with it, I just feel that the film could have been a lot shorter and achieve the same results.I particularly like the characters played by Mark Wahlberg and Julianne Moore, as their acting skills are great as usual. The Rollergirl (Heather Graham) gets too annoying with her perpetual skating, and I feel a little sorry for Heather Graham because her role is reduced to being an empty vessel who only needs to look pretty.I like the dance sequences in the scene where Dirk leads the dancing on a dance floor with Rollergirl briefly joining. After all the fun, most characters get back to square one, except Dirk because of his \"talent\". It's an OK film to watch.",

Not that they didn't act well; it's just that this is a movie which the world would be a better place had it never been made. I will give credit to Moore, Reynolds and especially Wahlberg for taking roles that could lead to everlasting embarrassment. Maybe they were broke, I don't know. That would make more sense than the notion that they saw artistic merit in this script.Maybe the sequel will be Showgirls Boogy Knights?I rated this a 1 only because there was no zero available.",

Unfortunately, it doesn't deal with what ultimately killed Holmes, and it certainly could have benefited from doing so.  Burt Reynolds and Mark Wahlberg got the most praise for this, but I felt the true stars were Julianne Moore as the cocaine-sniffing mother wannabe, Don Cheadle as a black man struggling with identity as pornstar/stereo-salesman in some wild getups and William H. Macy, who's wife is the ultimate slut.  Not to mention a nearly unrecognizable Alfred Molina.  Macy's new year's eve bash and Cheadle's chance for a better life after a donut shop robbery gone wildly wrong are probably the two best scenes in the movie, or at least the two best shot. What this movie does best is show how power can easily corrupt in its various forms.

They are frighteningly similar in a lot of ways, and I think Showgirls was a lot more entertaining. Marky Mark is no more of an actor then Elizabeth Berkely. The second half of the movie is just a long, pointless Tarantino rip-off that is even harder to watch then 2 Days In The Valley. When I think of this movie's success, all I can think about is the story about the Emperor's New Clothes.

It would take too long to go into detail of every character but lets just say that everyone is portrayed in a fantastic way standout being burt Reynolds and walhburg to me. The characters are also very well writing i only had 2 issues with the writing of the characters.2. The films design is amazing and really captures that 70s and early 80s feel while also portraying Hollywood in a very stylish beautiful way.3. Pta crafts a very Scorsese like movie here that gives off heavy goodfellas vibes which is a great thing. Pta really did a good job with this one.4. The best scene to me is when dirk has hit his all time low jerking off infront of a stranger again and then jack has a outrage after a porn situation went wrong. The editing is very smooth, music, acting everything was A+5. The stuff with amber and her actual kids i think fits in the story really well showing that she cant be an actually functioning mother so she decides to mother the children of her porn family.6. Another perfect thing about this movie is how it puts a group of misfits that are misunderstood and puts them together to be a \"family\" that gets along and understands each other.7. The rise to fame with dirk is absolutely amazing stuff and A+ cinema to me the fall i had issues with but when you are on the journey of dirk coming to the top is perfect with amazing direction, pacing, acting and editing.8. Another big plus to this movie is the editing. It feels very smooth and fluid.9. The little bill and Scottie characters i think are actually very good and show how that with scottie even if he does fit in he is still a sad character and with bill he never could find his place.10. Cant go into all the characters but I want to talk little bit about dirk. He is played so good by Walhburg bc he is portrayed as insecure, broken , and always has a chip on his shoulder because he was never accepted by his actual family and was outcast by them expected to be a loser like his mom says. That stays with him throughout the story. The ending is also very interesting, at first I didn't like it but when thinking more about it I actually kinda do because its dirk realizing he isn't accepted anywhere else so he goes back to the people who did accept him and makes things right. The mirror scene is amazing because as dirk stands up his face isn't in the shot its just his dick and he says \"im a star im a star im a star\" whats amazing about that scene its just his dick the only thing that is a star and brought him to the top, pta you outdid yourself with this scene.Negatives:1. The rise of dirks fame is amazing, when he is at the top amazing although i found during his fall that it has some plot holes and issues. First is that there is really no build up to dirks outrage at jacks house. The new guy doesn't really do anything and it seems like just an odd and rushed move for dirk to make since he was treated good around there. Second is the making music subplot with dirk and reed felt like a plot that didn't have an ending and kinda got forgotten abt.2. I think the alfred malino cameo scene, and don cheddle donut scenes are a lil to long and stylized but those are small negatives.Overall:The movie is extremely entertaining and A+ to me in the first half, has some slumps in the middle but never fails to entertain and when you look deeper has an amazing message.Writing/plot/characters 9/10\nActing 10/10\nDesign/cinematography 10/10\nMusic 9.510\nDirecting 9.5/10\nEditing 9.5/1057.5/6096%",

            "content": "If you wanted an example of perfect filmmaking to come from a new director in the 1990s, many would instantly choose Pulp Fiction. It's the most logical option, and certainly higher regarded when compared to Anderson's second feature, Boogie Nights. But what Boogie Nights has that Pulp Fiction doesn't is the deep character details and backstories. In Pulp we jump from character to character with little rhyme or reason whereas in Boogie, we start with Eddie Adams and end up with his new persona, Dirk Diggler. I've always felt a stronger connection with Boogie Nights and when it comes to a rewatch, it's more enjoyable overall.The dynamite 70s soundtrack is a prime example of how the movie creates such a great atmosphere of the era. Of course, set design is a major factor but as a lover of music from that era, it was great to see so many awesome songs crop up. Burt Reynolds' character is my favourite in the movie; it's a real shame he didn't want to ever watch the movie post-release. In my opinion, it's his best role- he got a Golden Globe win and an Oscar nom for his turn as Jack Horner, the calm and cool Movie Director that Dirk finds himself working with.Talk about an ensemble cast! Wahlberg, John C. Reily, Julianne Moore, Don Cheadle, Heather Graham, Luiz Gusman, William H. Macy, Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Alfred Molina. Genius casting across the board, no matter how small or insignificant the role. They each get certain scenes or moments to shine. I have to admit, my favourites were Guzman, Hoffman and Molina. All three give stunning performances that are highly underrated roles, Molina for example, only appears for one scene, but the scene is magnificent and he is magnificent in it.The rise and fall style story structure seen in other legendary movies such as Barry Lyndon or GoodFellas is also seen here, but adapted to fit a different style of filmmaking. Anderson is more similar to Tarantino than he is to Scorsese or Kubrick in the way he directs his films- a very eccentric and humourous style.And this applies to fans of all three directors above- watch Boogie Nights. It is an immense film that does absolutely everything and more.",

There were previous softcore porn films that snuck some hardcore action in (i.e., THE PIGKEEPER'S DAUGHTER, PLEASE DON'T EAT MY MOTHER), but this was full-on, deep sexual penetration here.Heather Graham (actually a rather good actress) plays herself, a woman unsatisfied with her sex life. After consulting doctor Burt Reynolds (the first male porn superstar and another good actor), he discovers her clitoris is deep down in her throat, meaning she must give \"deep throat\" oral sex to pleasure herself and her partner. She practices on Burt, then becomes a nurse for him, aiding his patients with sexual problems (including a \"Coke addict\"). Meanwhile, Burt has sex with his nurse in many positions, with Heather in many positions, and Heather's friend has group sex.A lot of the sex in the film is not very erotic because it is filmed like open-heart surgery: up close and personal. The best sex scenes are the deep throat blowjobs, Heather's friend's gangbang, and Heather having sex with Burt to cure his broken penis (!). Anyway, BOOGIE NIGHTS is legendary and should be seen by anyone who is into either a) hardcore sex or b) waiting to be introduced to the world of hardcore pornography. It is not a very good erotic aid, but it works well as a comedy above all else and features rather good performances by the cast (especially Graham, Reynolds, and the actor who plays Linda's friend, Don Cheadle) and an ingenious plot (for a porno film).",

            "content": "After having it watched for the fifth or sixth time since I had first seen it when in came out cinema back in 1997, it struck me that this film only gets better with age.The second half of the 1990s saw few, more or less successful, cinematic re-examinations of the late 1970s. Spike Lee's \"Summer of Sam\" is a worthy example.\"Boogie Nights\" is a historical account of certain eminent trends, social structures and patterns that existed at the time. Set between 1977 and 1983, the film portrays the pornographic film industry in California at its peak, and its imminent downfall, invoked by the introduction of the video tape - something that reduced the creative ambition of the porn filmmakers to a simple push-button recording and introduced competition from anonymous amateurs to the business.It appears that the people involved in the industry (actors, producers, directors, technicians) all lived in a sort of a ghetto (flashy and glossy nonetheless); had they ever dared to part from it, they would have had inevitably gotten burned - either by the stigma that had been cast on them, or in the face of the fact that their abilities in the real world were never held at a high price, which is what lured them into the industry in the first place. It is obvious, then, that inside this little world, these people have found a haven where they could appear important, a universe which was built upon and sustained through all sorts of hedonistic temptations and dubious financial sources. It was a cocaine-fed lie, and they knew it.\"Boogie Nights\" describes the paradigm shift of the sex cinema industry in a similar manner in which \"Gone with the Wind\" approached the abolition of slavery as an eclipse of the civilization of the South. One of the film's features is that it loosely depicts real-life characters and situations, like the film's Dirk Diggler (Wahlberg's character) posing for John Holmes in real life. This is what makes characters of the film all the more believable; they are ignorant, shallow, terrified and self-indulgent. The soundtrack of the film is impressively appropriate.Certain scenes definitely make cinema history, like the one in Alfred Molina's character's apartment, where an unexplained Chinese character, probably in an opium-induced frenzy, explodes fire-crackers every half a minute or so. The story-telling in scenes such as this one hits the mark in expressing the state of the characters' minds. The film is simply brilliant.",

            "content": "Paul Thomas Anderson wrote an impressive original screenplay for his first official Drama film \"Boogie Nights\". He of course also directed the film. The story takes place in 1977 during the time when porno films were filmed on movie cameras and were released theatrically in porno movie theaters. By 1983, when the movie ended, the porno film industry has switched from theatrical release to video tape release. This era that I referred to is called \"the golden age of porn flicks (1970s-early 1980s)\".That is mainly involved in the plot of the movie. The film was released on October 10, 1997. The film shows experience on how it's like becoming a famous porn star in the porn cinema industry and here's how it began in the movie : Mark Wahlberg portrays a 17 year old high school drop-out and dishwasher working in a Los Angeles nightclub named Eddie Adams. Eddie lives with his parents in Torrance, California. One night, Eddie is discovered by a porn film director named Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds) at the nightclub, where he works.The Nightclub is owned by Maurice Rodriguez portrayed by Puerto Rican character actor Luis Guzman. Then, Jack became fascinated of Eddie so, he took him to his house to audition him by watching him having sex with roller girl (Heather Graham), who is a young female porn actress who always wears roller skates all the time. After Eddie succeed the audition, Jack hires him to star in his pornography films. There was a argument that Eddie and his mom had about his open relationship girlfriend and his sexual life. That's what made Eddie decide to run away home and move in with Jack Horner in his San Fernando Valley home. After Eddie agreed with Jack to get involved with the Porn film industry, he changes his name to his screen name Dirk Diggler. Speaking of which, here's a fun fact: Boogie Nights was an expansion of P.T. Anderson's short film The Dirk Diggler story (1988).After Dirk Diggler started in a couple of Jack Horner's films, he started to become a famous male porn star of pornographic films.The films' big cast is definitely well casted just like Anderson's third film Magnolia. Julianne Moore portrays Maggie a.k.a Amber Waves, who is female porn star of Horner's films, drug addict, former housewife & mother and she develops a relationship with Dirk. William H. Macy portrays Jack's assistant film director Little Bill, he is married to porn star who constantly bangs (sex) on men. Reed Rothchild portrayed by John C. Riley, who develops a great friendship with Dirk and stars with him in a film series of action theme porn films. He has a dream of becoming a famous rock musician and a magician. Buck Swope is portrayed by Don Cheadle, who is an hi-fi stereo salesman and second-tier actor. Maurice Rodriguez the night club owner also wants to star in Jack Horner's porn films. Rick Jay portrays Jack's cinematographer. The Colonel James portrayed by Robert Ridgely is the porn film financer. The Colonel's boss is Floyd Gondolli portrayed by Phillip Baker Hall, who on New Year's Eve, 1980, breaks the news to Jack that videotape holds the future of the porno industry.Phillip Seymour Hoffman portrays Scotty J. is a gay boom operator, who is in love with Dirk.The reason why P.T. wrote an impressive original screenplay because every line that he wrote in the script made it astonishing. It's one of those movies that has an experience type of story. It's just like the mob movie Goodfellas that features how is the experience like in the Italian-American Mafia. Boogie Nights shows you the experience of becoming a famous porn star of the 1970s.It's also just like Stanley Kubrick's Vietnam War flick Full Metal Jacket (1987), it shows experience of becoming a soldier in Vietnam war.Here's another example of the perfect film that shows experience:their is also a crime drama film called Boyz N The Hood (1991) that shows experiences of growing up in the African-American ghetto of South Los Angeles. P.T. Anderson's magnificent cinematography film style has Stanley Kubrick's same significant film style. P.T.'s same film style as Kubricks' is the film camera following the characters body movement. For example, the scene when the film camera follows the female background character gets into the pool during Jack's pool party. Stanley Kubrick was Paul Thomas Anderson's main influence and that's why he uses Kubrick's film style to make his films. Thats what makes his film style magnificent.Burt Reynolds played the perfect role as the porn film director. His role marked him that he acted out very well for his role. Warren Beatty and Sydney Pollack were originally offered the role of Jack Horner. I am not so sure why Beatty turned down but, I Pollack attended the film's premiere and expressed regret for turning the role down. Mark Wahlberg portrayed an outstanding role as Dirk Diggler for a couple of reasons. He portrayed his first out of his element dramatic lead role. The way that Mark Wahlberg portrayed his first lead Dramaitic very talentedly. His lead role of Boogie Nights made him famous as a movie star. That is the reason why Boogie Nights is Mark Wahlberg's best film. 155 minutes of the film was overall great. It's the best film of the year 1997.Here's my advice for the film: \"It's definitely worth watching \". I give it a 4 out of 4 stars ****",

            "content": "Paul Thomas Anderson is somewhat of a frustration. He is a director with obvious talent but his films seem to have a very hollow center and feel more fragmentary than a complete film. Boogie Nights has a great energy and superficially present the early days of the adult entertainment industry. It is very loosely based on the career of John Holmes but does not really get into the darker aspects of his story when he was still making porn films while knowing that he was infected with the AIDS virus and probably infecting his unaware co stars. Like The Master Anderson really never goes too deep into the motivations of his characters and seems to focus on the more lurid aspects, wallowing in the excesses of the decade. There are plenty of great performances in the film and make it worth re watching periodically. The most sympathetic character is played Don Cheadle but I like the little family that forms amongst Burt Reynolds, Julianne Moore, Heather Graham, and Mark Walberg is genuinely sweet at times. But the excesses the era and the industry they are in cannot be entirely kept at bay and sets up the third act downward spiral. The soundtrack is spectacular and is a great sampler of the 70's but can be a bit overbearing at times in the course of the film, jumping from one song and going right into another...and then another. It is like a juke box that someone pumped a sack full of quarters into and you just want a little quiet time. I recommend to anyone interested in the subject to read a book called The Other Hollywood which expands on a lot of the subjects that Boogie Nights covers but with much more detail and insight into the darker aspects of adult pornography industry. Boogie Nights is flawed but has ambition.",

The film was nominated for three.  The film also includes a killer soundtrack which is very rare.  PT Anderson wrote a brilliant script which I own into a nearly three hour masterpiece.This film revived the career of Burt Reynolds.  It also launched careers for Mark Wahlberg, John C. Reily, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Don Cheadle, Luis Guzman, Thomas Jane, and Heather Graham.  Julianne Moore and William H. Macy also put together great performances.\"Boogie Nights\" is a look into the adult film business of the late 1970s and early 1980s.  Dirk Diggler, played by Wahlberg, is a seventeen year old with one special thing, a 13 inch long you know what.  You watch him as he rises to the top of the business and his terrible fall to the bottom.  Which includes drug use and even attempting to cut a record.Burt Reynolds is Jack Horner, an adult film director who discovers Diggler. Moore is Amber Waves, a mother who loses her child because of her occupation of an adult film star.  John C. Reily is Reed Rothchild, Dirk's best friend and sidekick in most his films.  Philip Seymour Hoffman is Scotty, who works on most of the films.  Heather Graham plays Rollergirl, who is just a very interesting character.PT Anderson really proved that he is the one of the best filmmakers in Hollywood with this film.  This film is just truly a classic.  A lot of memorable lines and scenes.  \"Boogie Nights\" is not a porno and is a must see for anyone who wants to see a great film.",

This is typical P T Anderson excellence.  What more can I say except that it is a shame that there is not an \"ensemble acting\" category for the Academy Awards because this group would have either won it hands down or been robbed.  Cinematically, the final scene, with the camera following Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds) through the house to the studio is a breathtaking piece of work.

            "content": "Boogie Nights is a parable. It is a cautionary tale, a tale of misfits in a makeshift family and it is a story about an era--how a time and place felt, how wonderful that feeling was, and how it couldn't last.Innocence is a theme and a feel in this film. What could be less innocent than pornography? Boogie Nights admittedly sugar coats the industry enough to make it palatable to the audience enough to keep them focused on greater themes of human nature, family, finding a place in the world, and the idea that everyone has something special, a gift.It is often said by viewers that Dirk is pathetic and his penis is the star. The way he's portrayed though, it is clear he is the perfect storm and his 'gift' is his general sexual appeal mixed with pleasant personality, perfect for the industry at the time. Back then both male and female performers were seen as sexy people, not just meat. Very touching is watching how Walberg plays Eddie/Dirk before he enters the industry. He's beat down by a loveless family and a mean mom who does not believe in him in any way. The archetype of this mom, far from outrageous, is so relevant to reality that it makes most viewers cringe. Eddie/Dirk walks out with nothing but belief in self to find his own off beat version of self worth, and in the process he gets a de facto family.Boogie follows a whole array of characters with varying degrees of closeness. Few films allow one to feel connected to this volume of people. Perhaps, though, it is the odd father/son substitute between Dirk and Jack (Reynolds) that is at the personal center of the film. We don't see it fully until their last hug at the end, but Dirk is no throwaway talent to Jack--he likes Dirk, and thinks he's not a replaceable person or talent. Perhaps he sees himself as a father figure to Dirk.Despite the changes in Dirk throughout the movie, fueled by B-level 'underground' stardom, he remains mostly a likable guy and you can see why the others in the 'porn family' like him so. He only loses control and breaks off (for a time) when his cocaine problem gets the best of him. Even then, he is kind and loyal most of the time. Everything in these late 70's early 80's days was more innocent, even if they aren't in principal. The drug of choice is coke, which while bad, is not as bad as the Crack and Heroin that would take over as the 80's ran on. Even at his lowest low, the infamous scene where he tries to sell fake coke and everything goes wrong, Dirk maintains a level of innocence and goodness that most wouldn't and later eras might not allow for. He makes a decision there, in the famous space-out shot, to go back to Jack and set his life back on track (relatively speaking).A dimension of Boogie Nights that astounds me is the documentary aspect. This involves rigorous recreation of the look, the styles, the fashion and the feel of self indulgent, brightly colored innocence that went so far as to make the porn industry something of a fun, light time.The bare bones production of the porn films is fondly milked for smiles. Andersen doesn't let this fondness for his characters and their era allow them off the hook. He constantly skewers how dumb most of the characters are. He allows us to have a laugh at what was considered classy and fashionable at the time--crazy collars, polyester, platforms, feathered hair. Perhaps the most pathetically funny scene I've ever viewed in a movie is when Dirk and Reed try their hand at music. Dirk sings (off key) a classic piece of 80's cheese from the transformers movie 'The Touch' and a song, right out of the era, Reed and Dirk work on in front of us (actually by John C. Reily and Anderson)'Feel the Heat'. No director has ever gone this far to recreate an era. In addition, we get some scenes from the actual Dirk porn films,(a hilarious foray into Dirk and Reed creating a 'James Bond type character'). Finally, we get to see a documentary about Dirk made by his mother figure, Amber Waves.Boogie gets us to believe in an era, one that has a reputation that's less than flattering. As a bit a parable, bit of a satire and a bit of a legend, it takes a black and white view--as soon as 1980 dawns trouble begins. It works in the mythic universe of this film and what it is trying to do. The changes we see under the small lens of the porn industry in the film help us to understand where we are culturally today, oddly enough. The fact that the 80's are a darkness that comes and can't be dodged, but the characters find ways to deal with it suggests something about human nature and also what our age is all about--putting up with our ever more destructive excess.The film also gives true pathos to mostly stupid people who at times make poor decisions. We are interested in them, and cheer for them. Even when we laugh at them we don't dismiss them. As an audience we relate to them, even as they are ostracized in a untouchable line of work. The film is a legend based on the most odd subject, yet we feel it on a personal level and the human tales are transferable to anyone's life.Few films do this much, show us this many aspects of the human condition, have this much humor, warmth and satire, bring to life an era in such vivid splendor, and are this much fun. Boogie Nights is one of the great films of our time.",

            "content": "My Rating: ***1/2 out of ****. Boogie Nights will be remembered as the movie that made Paul Thomas Anderson into a successful director. He got critical acclaim for this film and received an Academy Award Nomination for Original Screenplay, which was well deserved. Boogie Nights ended up on top ten lists for 1997 and one critic called it, \"The Best Movie of the Decade.\"Anderson's films always have some unique look to it. Boogie Nights is no exception. The film gives off a seventies feel that is undeniable. This is mainly due to the set designs and the cinematography. The feeling also changes very well when the film moves into the eighties.\nThere was alot of hard work put into writing this script. The Academy saw it that way too and gave Anderson a nomination for his writing. The writing is what Anderson receives a nomination for in his movies, he received another one two years later for Magnolia. Boogie Nights has a well written script that only contains a few flaws. Those flaws are mostly overlooked when watching the film, except for one. Acting is a strength in Anderson's films and it definitely is here. Mark Wahlberg gives the least impressive performance but hes still good. His performance is uneven. During the beginning he seems a bit stiff, but he warms up to it and turns in a solid performance. Burt Reynolds received alot of attention for his performance (A golden globe win and an oscar nomination) and he does do a great job here. William H. Macy does some scene-stealing work, in fact I wished he had a little more screentime. Don Cheadle, Heather Graham, Nina Hartley, Alfred Molina, and John C. Reilly all do solid work. However, the standout here is Julianne Moore. This represents her best performance to date and it shows why she is so talented.\nLike I said, Boogie Nights is not a flawless film. The most glaring flaw I found in the film came at the end. I did not like how Anderson decided to end this. It was unsatisfying and it also seemed somewhat-immature. However, Anderson does so many things right its possible to overlook the few flaws. Alot of his fans say this to be his best film. Personally, I prefer Magnolia, I thought it was a more mature picture and Anderson put one of the most creative endings on the screen. Boogie Nights is still very good and I give the film a strong recommendation.",

Reilly: Masterpiece about porn industry in 1970's when sex and drugs were without consequence. Burt Reynolds delivers a great performance as a director out to make the greatest porn film ever. He discovers Mark Wahlberg as the amusingly named Dirk Diggler, a dishwasher and renders him his star player. His success leads to drugs and the fear of replacement as numerous awards. Julianne Moore plays the leading lady undergoing a child custody battle. Heather Graham steals scenes as Rollergirl who roller-skates in the nude. John C. Reilly plays Diggler's co-star in amateur porn, as well as being a magician. Great ensemble cast playing outcasts rejected from society. Brilliantly observant view by director Paul Thomas Anderson who previously tested the waters with Hard Eight. We sense Wahlberg's rejection from home and his longing for acceptance, and Reynolds as director Jack Horner whose frustration to create art out of exploitation. Moore plays Amber Waves who tackles directing as well as provide a mother figure where she failed in reality. Anderson juggles several subplots as this large cast interact but he also gives great vision into the seventies porn industry. Great film about broken lives lead by lust, fame and the desire to matter. Score: 9 / 10",

            "content": "Though it is 2003 I feel that the comments on this film are rather weak and I would like to update them.The opening sequence is one of the best in the films. The first few shots introduce all the main characters that are important to the story without it even feeling like that was the intention. We are shown the dance club, roller girl, Maurice, Jack and Amber/Maggie, Eddie/Dirk, and Little Bill (William H. Macy). Amazing that Anderson could be so blunt with that and not even feel like you're being smothered with characters. Brilliant directing.Boogie Nights is one of my favorite films. It deals with the rise and fall of numerous characters during the peak of pornography in the 70's and early 80's. Mark Wahlberg gives probably his best performance we might ever see. Burt Reynolds plays Jack Horner, a filmmaker trying to tell stories through pornography. Hard task but he's a man of vision and the character in my mind is a genius. This too was a great performance by not my favorite Burt Reynolds.This film should be studied by cinematographers and writers alike. My best and easily acceptable example is the donut shop scene. Cinematographers note that in this scene there are so many opprotunities for reflection but not once do you see the camera. Not once. This, in my opinion is one of the best scenes. The beauty of that scene shows how simple the human mind really is. Don Cheadle had numerous options after what happens and you could see it in his face that he was thinking about what to do. He chooses selfishness, takes the bag and runs, which I believe most of us would choose.Writers take note that Boogie Nights goes into great character development and has a number of characters to build. Paul Thomas Anderson is I think one of the best writers of our era. His understanding of human suffering and confusion brings his characters to life. Especially Eddie Adams and Jack Horner. Anderson shows even more depth and emotion in his film Magnolia. But that's another story.If you don't like Boogie Nights that's perfectly alright. The beauty of Boogie Nights is that the film is about the 70's porn era, but there is barely any nudity when plenty could have been put in. The film doesn't glorify pornography, it shows how great and terrible it can be. Or at least how quickly something good can be swept out from under you. Boogie Nights is about people and their belonging in this world, whether it be the porn industry or anything else. It's not about porn, or sex, or making drugs seem great. It shows how easily people can be corrupted and ruined by the things around them. I love this film and recommend it to anyone who is going to study film.Why Anderson hasn't recieved an oscar for writing and directing I don't know. His films keep getting better and deeper. The thought provoking movies he has made keep me coming back for more. I'm sure he has plenty of ideas for the next decade or so to entertain the masses.",

Among the things this movie does right (a very well chosen cast, great production design that brings the '70s to life, and an excellent soundtrack), the characters are what really make it live and breathe. These are real people, funny, tragic, na\u00efve, sleazy; they run the gamut. What's more, this is set against the porn industry, so it's disarming when you find yourself caring so much for people who live and deal in sleaze. When things are up, it's exciting. When the chips are down, it's just punishing (Whalberg's assault and Moore's custody hearing, especially). On second thought, I don't even think there's really a happy ending to the story - but just returning to the status quo is enough for all involved.

            "content": "Boogie Nights is a film that should sit with pride in any collection. Its a film about so much more than fly on the wall look at the Porn Industry of the 1970s and the character types that inhabited that world, its a statement about the excesses that permeated the end of one decade and the beginning of another. Mark Wahlberg brings in a confident performance, demonstrating once again, that it can all be about the material that the actor is given. He plays Eddie Adams, a bus boy in the valley of Los Angeles at the club of Luis Guzman who is soon brought to the attention of adult movie director Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds in what is probably his best ever performance) and soon turned into super porn star thanks to his considerable talents below the waist. Director Anderson made no secret that the story was partially inspired by the late John Holmes, but here he seems to be represented also by a supporting character, played by a young Thomas Jane.Though initially the journey is that of Eddie into porn star Dirk Diggler, Anderson very capably gives all his supporting characters flesh on their bones and their own stories which endear us to them all. John C Reily, Nicole Ari Parker (Massively underrated actress) Don Cheadle, Melora Waiters (Superb) all bring life to the ensemble of the piece as the rest of the adult stars in Horners circle of friends, all of their characters have flaws and weaknesses, but all of them too seek something beyond the porn industry that they find themselves. Julianne Moore is the mother of the group taking on Dirk and Rollergirl (Heather Graham) as her siblings in place of her estranged son, who her ex husband will not let her have contact with because of her involvement in the industry - She copes with this by consuming vast amounts of drugs and showing her affections on her co-stairs instead. Anderson uses a number of interesting techniques to make dialogue scenes a little more interesting and the film, though long, passes through the 6 decades it covers at a bouncy pace. The production design here must be commended too as its all spot on, and the colours of the film make you feel like you are watching a movie from that era. Anderson manages to blend both the tragic and hilarious moments of very life seamlessly as they often are in reality to great effect here. The fact is the porn industry here is used as the catalyst to study the excesses of the era, but you didn't need to be in the porn industry to be involved them. Although the ending maybe a little unsatisfying, showing you that some characters have moved on while us are much where we found them in the first place, it is true to life and the study of character here is first rate. Every single supporting role has a pitch perfect cast too which include a young Seymour Hoffman, already showing his metal and William H Macy as Little Bill in one of the first roles I remember him in. A recent re-watch of this on DVD encouraged me to leave this review and at first I was thinking 'God this hasn't aged well' but actually yes it has, I just forgot that I was suppose to feel like I was in the 1970s, then I remembered, that is the point. Put this with Studio 54 on in one evening and you will feel you have lived the end of the 70s on both coasts of America. A time before the shadow of AIDS and HIV came into the heterosexual world.",

The ensemble cast is uniformally excellent. Julianne Moore, Heather Graham, Burt Reynolds, Mark Wahlberg, and Don Cheadle are absolutely perfect. One of the best movies of the 90's. In my opinion, 2nd only to Fargo.",

            "content": "Boogie Nights feels quite similar to gangster films such as Goodfellas in that it is about a close-knit 'family' who exist in a closed-off world, out-with the mainstream. Unlike that aforementioned crime film, the characters here are largely misfits and lost souls. But stylistically, director Paul Thomas Anderson follows the style laid down by Martin Scorsese pretty closely. What with the fluid cinematography with bravura long-takes; the specific period detail captured by way of the colours, dress, decor and music of the time \u2013 including some priceless recreations of dialogue scenes based on genuine 70's porn films. But this is no mere Scorsese clone; it has a life and feel all of its own. The fabulous script mixes comedy and tragedy in a highly effective way \u2013 the humour is laugh-out-loud funny, while the dark elements pull no punches. There are several contrasts of the porn industry that are examined \u2013 the 70's 'innocence' vs 80's cynicism, the porn golden age vs straight-to-video low-rent. All of these dynamics fuel the plot-line which effectively works as a rise-and-fall narrative, with an ending which has some hope yet illustrates the inescapable trap that the porn industry creates.What takes all of this up several levels more is that this is an ensemble film of the highest level. The cast here is quite brilliant. Impressively, many of these actors and actresses, who would go on to make great careers, make their breakthrough performances here. Burt Reynolds wasn't one of those but his role here as porn director Jack Horner was his best since Deliverance (1972) and his measured performance here was rewarded with an Academy Award nomination. Then there is Mark Wahlberg in the central role as Dirk Diggler, he proved himself as more than capable of leading a film and shows considerable skills at both comic and dramatic acting. Julianne Moore puts in a towering performance as Amber Waves the porn queen who fights a doomed custody battle to get access to her child and whose maternal instincts are transferred to others within her porn family. Heather Graham is unforgettable as the super-hot starlet Rollergirl who never removes her skates. John C. Reilly is very funny as the veteran porn actor who takes Dirk under his wing. Don Cheadle is both funny and sympathetic as a bizarrely country-and-western fixated stereo-salesman who does porn on the side. Philip Seymour Hoffman makes a huge mark as the super-awkward crew-member who is in love with Dirk. William H. Macy is the assistant director who is consistently humiliated by his porn star wife's hilariously public infidelities, leading to tragedy.There are far too many classic scenes to mention in this one. It never misses a step all the way. Boogie Nights isn't just very good, it's one of the very best. A triumph in every way.",

            "content": "Paul Thomas Anderson's Boogie Nights adheres to many conventions of gender in terms of the way it portrays women, but subverts its portrayal of men by highlighting masculine insecurity and the fear of being inadequate. The film concerns a young man named Eddie, played by Mark Wahlberg, who has dropped out of high school and is making ends meet working as a busboy at a nightclub and living with his parents. One day on the job, he catches the eye of Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds), a renowned porn director during the industry's \"Golden Age,\" who admires his natural attractiveness and invites him to come spend time with him at his enormous ranch. Numerous people live under Jack's roof, including a young starlet named \"Rollergirl\" (Heather Graham), nicknamed because of her obsession with her rollerblades, Maggie (Julianne Moore), an older porn actress famous for a long-running series of films, Buck (Don Cheadle), a struggling stereo salesman, and Reed (John C. Reilly), a squirrelly man who seems to just live off of Jack's dime. Upon running away from home, Eddie soon becomes \"Dirk Diggler,\" one of the industry's most famous and acclaimed porn stars almost overnight; he is glitzed with awards, recognition, and more money than he could ever spend, but slowly allows his masculinity and fragile ego to command him as a person. Such concepts heavily adhere to feminist film writer Laura Mulvey's ideas of \"phallocentrism\" and the male gaze. With that, Boogie Nights handles male and female characters quite differently, giving the male characters an inferiority complex that makes them define their worth based on their own personal work, and the two main female characters in the film dichotomous roles, one to showcase attractiveness and the other to showcase the lack thereof.The pornographic industry has always been under fire for its treatment and sexualized depictions of women. Paul Thomas Anderson immediately dismantles that assertion by giving it some equality; in porn, everyone, regardless of race or gender, is a sex object, though most pay to see said films to have their eyes locked on the females in the film. Consider the fact that in Boogie Nights, Rollergirl, while having a name, which you may have missed, lacks a character. Her mysteriousness is part of her aura and that's the attraction in porn, Anderson subtly implies. Because we don't know much about Rollergirl as a character, we, the audience, can appreciate her for her flesh and ability to have sex because we can't look beneath the surface at her character. Her flat characterization, while devaluing her as a person, essentially makes her successful at what she is trying to convey; an empty vessel capable of great sex many men of varying different ages can only dream about. Had we learned about Rollergirl as a person \u2013 maybe she had a troubled childhood, did poorly in school, or simply doesn't have a strong and sustainable relationship with her family \u2013 she would've become less attractive because she would've had more baggage, and that's not the kind of pleasure we pay to see or hear when we watch pornography. Anderson showcases this by portraying Rollergirl as unbridled sexiness as a porn starlet.Read the full analysis on my blog, http://stevepulaski.blogspot.com/2015/11/the-penis-power-and- predicaments.html",

            "content": "'Boogie Nights' is centered around seventeen year old Eddie Adams (Mark Wahlberg) who leaves home to pursue a career in the porn industry under the alias Dirk Diggler. This film follows Dirk and an all-star cast in exposing their lives within the porn industry from the 1980's to 1970's. 'Boogie Nights' is written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, best known for his work in 'Boogie Nights' and 'Magnolia'. The cast in this film was absolutely perfect. In most cases with an all-star cast, you would expect a film to be sloppy and made just for the money, but the entire cast was flawless. When you can cast a film full of amazing actors and get them all to mesh together and work so well, you know you have a great film. Mark Wahlberg obviously steals the show as Dirk Diggler. Although it is really hard to pin point one actor in the film because they were all just so great. It was very intriguing to watch the entire cast grown throughout the film. One thing that really made this movie special was, you cared for all the characters. Through their falls and triumphs, you are there for it all and you really pull for them to succeed. One thing that really surprised me was the cinematography in this film. Every scene was shot perfectly and is so pleasing to the eye. Cinematography as well as the score in this film were done just right. Score matched perfectly for the situations and set the tone for events taking place. Editing was done right, served its purpose. Costume design was very well done to. Portrayed the 70's and 80's perfectly. It is real hard to get all these things right in a film, so a tip of the hat to all cast and crew.'Boogie Nights' received 3 Academy Award nominations. One nomination for the role of Burt Reynolds supporting role as Jack Horner. Reynolds does an outstanding job with his role and is so powerful on screen. Another nomination came to Julianne Moore in her supporting role as Amber Waves. Whenever Moore is on screen she is mesmerizing. She plays her role perfectly and it is one of the greatest in her career. The final nomination came to Paul Thomas Anderson for Best Writing/Screenplay. I can not praise Anderson enough. The writing in this movie is great, everything was just gold. Great job by Anderson on directing and writing this film. I must say I am surprised Wahlberg did not get a nomination and I am highly surprised that this film did not win a single Academy Award.'Boogie Nights' is a very surprising film that all movie watchers should see at some point in their life. The way this all-star cast works together is astonishing and a rarity. Every aspect of the film, acting, cinematography, score, you name it, was perfect. People skeptical about viewing this film thinking it is all about porn should know one thing. This is not a porno. This film follows the lives of many individuals through the 70's and 80's. Sure a bulk of the movie is about the porn industry, but there is not a mass amount of porn in the actual movie. Ultimately, 'Boogie Nights' will leave you feeling many things. Laughs, depression, happiness, shock but most of all; satisfaction.'Boogie Nights' receives a perfect 10/10 from me!",

            "content": "BOOGIE NIGHTS starts with virtuoso camera work and goes down hill from there. Loosely based on the career of John Holmes and the erotic film business in general, the film is alternately harsher and gentler than reality.  As a former connoisseur of erotic films, I can tell you MANY of the 35MM erotic films made in the 70s and early 80s are better than BOOGIE NIGHTS.  Even many of the erotic film actresses were better looking than anyone in BOOGIE NIGHTS. I was appalled at how stupid everyone was presented to be.  Anyone who has listened to interview with many of the top flight erotic film stars of that time (Paul Thomas, Ron Jeremy, Annette Haven, John Leslie, Jamie Gillis, Gloria Leonard, Sharon Mitchell, Georgina Spelvin, Harry Rheems) can tell you, \"These people are NOT stupid.\" I did notice a couple of adult film people in this movie. Nina Hartley plays Bill Macy's wife (my, what goshawful makeup! Was that intentional?)Forget the gross errors (Burt Reynolds smoking a cigar near the camera while filming; references to FRESCA, when the product was off the market during those years; Bill Macy's blown line, \"My wife has her a** in a d**k\").  What about the shot in the bar when the camera is pointed off into space while Reynolds speaks, then pans over to him?  What about the terrible framing on Mark Wahlberg during the ripoff that climaxes the movie?  What about Don Cheadle's horrendous ignorance of stereo, even though he becomes obsessed with selling it? What about the guy telling Wahlberg to \"get in his car\" when he is driving a pickup?) My gosh, this stuff is amateur night. There IS some things to like in BOOGIE NIGHTS: a great performance by the late Robert Ridgely as Colonel James, and notable performances by Don Cheadle, Burt Reynolds and whomever the actor is who played Reynold's cameraman, as well as really fine period music. Anyone interested in the TRUE story of John Holmes (far more horrific than BOOGIE NIGHTS) should watch the special on E!  But I would like to make two points before I close. The box score on erotic film stars is not good.  Many die in their 30s.  The primary causes of death appear to be (in order) suicide, drug overdose, cancer and AIDS.  Second, does anyone besides me care that civil liberatarians seem more interested in cable TV and adult magazines for prisoners than whether prisoners are raped, brutalized or murdered by other prisoners?  I bring up that point because that appears to be the fate of one of the characters in the movie.",

Such films like Magnolia, The Master, and There Will Be Blood are all unique this way. Now Boogie Nights can be added to that list. This movie features vibrant storytelling and features lots of sex and drugs. No, this not an adult movie directly but it's more of an indirect adult movie aimed at the mainstream moviegoers.Anderson's film is about a guy named Eddie Adams who works at an L.A nightclub where he is discovered by porn director, Jack Horner. Now Eddie begins his new life as an adult star where he enjoys sex, drugs, and fame. But is this life truly for him? One would agree that this film has an incredible cast. Mark Wahlberg gives his break-out performance as Eddie and it's one of his best performances. Burt Reynolds and Julianne Moore give out Oscar-worthy performances as well. The rest of the cast in John C. Reilly, Heather Graham, Philip Seymour Hoffman, and Don Cheadle all create a very fine ensemble.Overall, Boogie Nights is a great film and one that adds a nice touch to the resume of Paul Thomas Anderson. It's a little lengthy especially for something like this source material, but the story is told in such a vibrant way. It's colorful, sexy, violent, and nearly a masterpiece of film. I rate this film 9/10.",

            "content": "The subject here is the porn industry from the late-1970s to the mid-1980s. \"Boogie Nights\" is a wild and crazy roller-coaster of a movie that dominates because of an unrelenting screenplay, smart direction, and outstanding performances by the entire cast.  Young Mark Wahlberg has had it at home and decides to go to work for adult-film director Burt Reynolds (Oscar-nominated).  He meets all sorts of interesting people as his career starts and gradually progresses.  The industry is quickly changing and Reynolds knows that his chances for theatrical success are decreasing as time passes.  Veteran actress Julianne Moore's (also Oscar-nominated) ex-husband is refusing to let her see her child because of the unsavory elements she is involved with.  John C. Reilly is successful, like Wahlberg, but his life is empty as well.  Assistant director William H. Macy is having trouble with his wife because of her numerous sexual affairs.  Young Heather Graham is also feeling the sting of the industry as she just cannot stay drug-free.  African-American actor Don Cheadle tries to get out of the industry, but his past keeps slapping him in the face.  In the end, some will meet with tragedy, some with triumph, and some will stay the same. Writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson knows exactly where he wants to go here and it is his direction that keeps everything focused throughout the running of the film.  In many ways \"Boogie Nights\" is an epic tale of sex, lies, drug-addiction, intense situations, and memorable characters that delivers on so many levels.  One of the best films of the 1990s.  4.5 out of 5 stars.",

            "content": "I must have watched writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson's Boogie Nights over thirty times in my life. Around 1999, it represented cinematic perfection to me and I would view it repeatedly. Now almost 20 years old - although I no longer consider it as the pinnacle of cinema - I still consider it great and to be one of the best movies of the 90's. This is mainly down to how fresh is still feels, with its show-off yet breathtaking long-takes, moments of off-the-wall humour, and dead-on depictions of the decadent 70's through to the over-indulgent 80's, which all assist the film in sweeping you into its hidden world of glamour, sex and drugs.That world is the world of pornography, though through Anderson's lens it doesn't feel too dissimilar to Hollywood itself, just on a smaller scale. The young, handsome and unnervingly well-endowed Eddie Adams (Mark Wahlberg) is working in the kitchen of a Hollywood nightclub when he is talent spotted by porno auteur Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds). Jack knows that \"there is something special behind those jeans just waiting to get out,\" and soon enough Eddie has renamed himself Dirk Diggler and is the hottest porn star in the country. With success comes the big house, the designer clothes and the fancy sports car, but also lots of cocaine.Clearly inspired by the work of Robert Altman, Boogie Nights boasts a fantastic ensemble of interesting characters, all hugely endearing despite their obvious flaws. Jack lives with porn star Amber Waves (Julianne Moore), who doesn't get to see her son due to her lavish lifestyle, and Rollergirl (Heather Graham), another actress fresh out of school who never takes her skates off. Dirk buddies up with Reed Rothchild (John C. Reilly), an aspiring magician who idolises his enigmatic co-star. Behind the camera are Little Bill (William H. Macy), the timid scriptwriter whose wife (played by real-life porn star Nina Hartley) openly sleeps with other men, and Scottie (Philip Seymour Hoffman), who becomes smitten with Dirk. There's also Buck (Don Cheadle), a stereo-system obsessive going through an image crisis.Anderson was only 26 when the film was released, hot off the disappointingly pedestrian Hard Eight (1996), and yet despite his youth he pulled of something remarkably complex with Boogie Nights. Not only is it a peek behind the curtain of a business normally portrayed as sleazy and distasteful, seen through the eyes of those who operate it, but also a summary of the shift in social attitudes and values at the time, from feelings of optimism and sexual expression of the 70's, to the greed and paranoia of the 80's. As Dirk's drug consumption spirals out of control, he struggles to perform and falls out with Jack. One standout scene near the final act sees Dirk, Reid and mustachioed sleazeball Todd Parker (Thomas Jane) attempt to pull off a drug deal with a friendly but unhinged Alfred Molina.It's during this scene that Anderson lingers on Dirk's face for a considerable amount of time. Although it probably only lasts about 25 seconds, it manages to pin-point his moment of realisation while allowing the audience time to some up their feelings towards him. And most probably, despite his horrible and selfish actions, you'll still hope it turns out well for him. The camera plays like a character sometimes, whether it be swooping in and out of a pool in one of the many homages to Martin Scorsese, or lingering on producer Colonel James's (Robert Ridgely) startled face as he sees Dirk's prize asset for the first time. Anderson would go on to prove himself one of the finest of his generation with Magnolia (1999), There Will Be Blood (2007) and The Master (2012), but Boogie Nights is still one of his best - dazzling, funny, and uniquely absorbing.",

I was completely pleased with this movie!It starts off in the late 70' with Eddie Adams (wahlberg), a niave teen who dream of fame.  He is having trouble at home.  He just can't seem to comunicate with his parents.  Eddie works at a nightclub a long way rom his home so that he can just get away.  It does not take long for adult film maker Jack Hornes to realize that Eddie was born with an abnormaly large penis, 13 inches to be exact.  Jack introduces Eddie to fellow porn stars. That night when Eddie gets home late he has a very big argue with his mother.  Eddie leaves his family behind and goes to live with Jack at his large house.Now Jack wants Eddie to be a star in hs porn films and Eddie gladly takes a role.  But under his new adult movie name, Dirk Diggler.  Dirk get's very popular in the industry and even wins a few Adult Movie Awards!  But success comes too soon for him and soon he is being replaced.  Dirk thinks he is the number one star in the porn buisness and reassures himsef by sayig \"I'm a star I'm a big bright shining star\".  But it doesn't help and when he blows up in Jack' face for little reasons (wich was an oscar-worthy performance) hes fired and lives a life of drugs.The movie is spectacular!  Mark proves himslef to be an amazing actor as do the rest of the cast.  Rollergirl, played by Heather Grahm happens to be one of my favorite charactors.  She gave her role spunk and personality, but did not overde it.  Amber Waves, played by Julieanne Moore, was also fantastic, she was mother to al those who needed it, including Dirk.  Some scenes I thoguht they even had a romantic relationship, but I may have been wrong.This movie is most certainly worth my time.  In fact bcause I missed a few important nudity scenes, like the end (if you have seenit you'l understand)because it came on a cable channel so they bleeped it out, think I'll go rent it so I can get the full enjoyment.In all this movie was robbed out of an oscar nomination as was Mark.  I give it 10/10 and two thumbs up!  I recall Entertainment Weekly raving it the years best movie for 1997.  Not Titanic.  It gave somthing fresh and new and different form most movies I se today.  I wish they made more like it.  Go see it!  It's amazing!",

            "content": "Can't say I've seen many theatrical released dramas about adult films, so this is new territory. Pornography is, obviously, very popular and this film showcases the rise of said industry in the 70's and its downhill in the 80's. It centres around the fictional Dirk Diggler (that name...it's just beautiful) and how he finds success through a adult film director named Jack Horner. Being in that type of business, Dirk starts becoming susceptible to the lavish lifestyle and the drugs and crime that follow. A fascinating albeit daring subject to tackle, director Paul Thomas Anderson manages to make it a rather compelling story. Slight tonal inconsistencies, particularly in the third act where it just loses steam but overall I found this to be thoroughly entertaining with dark comedic moments. It's another Anderson movie where his direction takes precedent. Super nice long takes that just lets the characters interact. Whether it be having sex, sniffing cocaine or running away from a shotgun wielding psychopath, the characters resembled the 70's. The disco attire looked fantastically authentic and really made me want to get down and boogie in my lounge (was so tempted...). Acting was outstanding all round. Julianne Moore and Burt Reynolds deserved their award nominations. Mark Wahlberg pulled off that sparky confident teenager role well. When it came to filming the pornography, the acting was incredibly cheesy which was sooo good to see. They honestly nailed it. Then seeing how porn progressed to amateur and drive-by within the 80's was interesting. I'm not addicted to porn or anything, but it's a refreshing subject to watch instead of slavery, haunted houses or World War II. So yes, despite the inconsistent tones this was incredibly enjoyable with phenomenal direction.",

            "content": "Another of these really long films to come out in early 98, the never dull BN is a mesmerizing look into the porn industry, a few sex scenes involving a lot of skin, implied, not as raunchy as a lot of people will expect. Mark Wahlberg, still in one of his best roles, plays the troubled street kid, who earns the name Dirk Diggler, with his discovered talent who's approached by Reynolds, a big time porn director, in one of his best ever acting parts. The two form a friendship, where Dirk becomes a friend among many other crew and cast, and becomes the next big thing. The period of late 70's to the breaking of the eighties is well captured and unhurried. Everyone is great where Wahlberg, competes well against some real acting heavy weights, (you'll know who I mean). Exceptionally good, was Julianne Moore, fantastic as a B porn actress fighting a lot of demons, only finding solace and happiness in what she's doing, while really she's floundering in despair, as fighting boldly to gain custody of her son. This film shows you what happens to retired porn stars, when seeking a new career or dream. One such instance threw me into a shockingly momentary disillusion. But this film is very inspirational, and how it tells you to \"Never give up on your dream\", especially in Dirk Diggler's case. There is a couple of coincidences in this film I didn't buy, and a little of repetition, hampering the great film, but the hampering really just becomes void, as we we don't have to forgive it, the films so good. One example involves a washed up Dirk Diggler getting pummelled by some gay hating punks, in a car park, while just after a limo just so happens to roll past with Burt and hot Heather Graham ( Rollergirl who never takes her skates off- EVER- I like that) getting it on with a high school jock who use to diss her. Shortly after, she in a much deserved revenge, as well as one I lapped up (You go girl) starts mashing the guy's face with her skates, after an offended Burt that is, tackles and punches him. There is some explosive violence, including one shock suicide scene, that's Wild Bill's doing, but like the sex, it's in the small number. My favorite scene is the one near the end, in an edgy, drug/money exchanged with a coked up Alfred Molina, as an young Asian kid, intermittently letting off firecrackers to intensify the nervousness, enwrapping Dirk Diggler and co (mo wearing Thomas Jane, you'll hardly recognize here, in still what I consider his best acting. BN is one hell of a movie ride and one of the best films of 1998. I have so much good stuff to write on this, but this is such a small offering. If you forgive the faults I mentioned, just sit back and watch what is a rewarding and insightful look into a industry was shunned, but it's how we see these shunned people lived, partied and boogied. The stick out hampering part is the ridiculous elongated penis, Marky Mark reveals at the end. Not only is it patently fake, it could do the Markster some mischief if tripping over it.",

It's an empty viewing experience. I'm not a prude by any standard, but is there any other place Hollywood movies about drugs, sex and porn go other than descent and misery? Gee, with such ignorant characters, I thought things would always be swell. The idea that somehow plots made porn more valuable before the industry moved to videotape is utterly ridiculous. Plot has always been in the way in porn movies. This didn't need to be 3 hours. It puts no ideas into play that do not issue directly from the mouths of one character or another. Long before Magnolia's contrived epiphany sequence Anderson was so uninterested in decent storytelling that he did it here too. All three characters have epiphanies compressed into a single day. I guess that was simpler for him to grasp. But hey, the \"long movie must be respectable\" gimmick worked and this garnered a bounty of nominations. So he's done it twice since.",

The movies just happen to be of the pornographic nature, which doesn't seem to faze Eddie all that much. He promptly changes his name to Dirk Diggler and the film follows his and his associates' career through the late 70s and early 80s. All the way from the golden age of porn right to the onset of video tape.For a film unabashedly about adult entertainment, the film is surprisingly non-raunchy in nature. Sure it's rated R, but there are very few sex scenes and it's more about the things that happen between the shoots. About the business itself and the kind of people it takes to undress in front of the cameras and do the naughty, as it were. It also has a great style and a lot of talent behind the camera. The soundtrack is well-crafted and contains a pleasingly huge amount of hits from those two decades. The costuming, the camera-work and the colours all harken right back to the 70s and it is one of the better period pieces about the decade I've yet seen.The acting is also superb. This is one of Wahlberg's earliest films and definitely one of the ones that put him on the map as someone with great acting chops. But the real star of the show has to be Burt Reynolds as the director Jack Horner, a man anguishing with the changes in his chosen medium, struggling to have his films seen as something worthwhile, perhaps even art.I'm sure this film has its critics solely because of its subject matter. But if you can get beyond that or if it doesn't bother you in the first place, Boogie Nights is a great film. Superbly crafted, well-acted and with a style of its own.",

            "content": "P.T. Anderson has created an incredible film about the rise and fall of an extended family of porn stars, and the individuals who supported them financially, during the late 70s-early 80s. During this time period, adult film-maker Jack Horner (played by Burt Reynolds in a Golden Globe winning performance) had a vision that his films could go \"legitimate\" in the mainstream film industry-- that is, be seen as more than pornography but as actual works of art. Many critics dismissed this film as pornography masquerading as bona fide movie-making.  Those who sat through the film, however, met a fascinating, albeit naive, group of characters. In a heart-breaking (and Oscar-nominated) performance, we meet Julianne Moore's beautiful \"Amber Waves\", an actress who seemingly has everything she desires but aches for the love of the son she has lost because of her chosen career path.  Amber readily channels this displaced love on her self-made family of actors, including Mark Wahlberg's \"Dirk Diggler\" and Heather Graham's \"Rollergirl\", who go through the motions of sex on screen but have no understanding of true love or intimacy due to prior rejection of family and/or society in general.Other note-worthy performances include Philip Seymour Hoffman's \"Scotty\", who spends the film smitten with and completely devoted to Dirk in a love that is painfully unrequited.  Also interesting are Don Cheadle's \"Buck\", the actor with loftier ambitions of owning a stereo store, and William H. Macy's \"Little Bill\", who is continually cuckolded by a wife who enjoys putting on sex shows with any willing man in public. This drama is played out with a wonderful soundtrack that revisits the glory days of disco and the \"one-hit wonder\" gems that peppered the early 80s. This was certainly one of the best films of 1997.",

Some would say that Boogie Nights is his only fully intact movie, in that it's main purpose isn't to reveal some other hidden meaning.In contrast, many casual viewers thought Boogie Nights was simply the story of a porn star. None of these people paid attention to the plot of the movie, and to whom the director is at the same time.  P.T. Anderson certainly didn't attain his joy for hidden meanings all of a sudden.  As anyone who has followed his career knows, it's in everything he makes. It's the kind of filmmaker he is.In short, just as several great movies before it, Boogie Nights is the story of America in the 70's through the 80's.  The climate in the movie follows that of the nation to a T.  The soft, fun and enjoyable 70's make way to the drugged, over-indulgent 80's with the striking image of, well, how's a double murder by and suicide of a jealous husband?Another P.T. Anderson trait, being coincidence of events, is overwhelmingly present in the movie.  A prime example being the night of 2 beatings and a very strange robbery, as well as the colonel's house being a magnet for Corvette's.Off the topic of the script itself, the acting is superb.  Rarely do you see so much acting talent in a movie.  The atmosphere of the movie fit the time it is set in perfectly.  The music fits well, and isn't over used (a trend that many 70's-80's movies were unable to resist).  It's very hard to find significant faults in the movie.I give it 4 stars (out of 4). The movie is extremely enjoyable. It's clever without being overbearing, it has all of the major cinematic elements, it succeeds in dissecting a delicate subject matter (pornography) without being overly vulgar, and the quality is exceptional.  To top it off, this is of a relatively amateur writer & director.See it.",

Except for Citizen Kane I have probably never seen a movie so enthusiastically cinematic. He is not afraid to use split screens and other unfashionable film techniques, and because he is not afraid to use them they work. This is one of the most confident films I've ever seen. Anderson's camera moves through the scenes like a kid in a candy store, floating about gayly eying everything around it but never coming to a full stop because there is so much other stuff to see. And there is certainly a lot to see. Boogie Nights is a huge ensemble, but Anderson never really gets lost in the scope (there is admittedly one storyline that doesn't really go anywhere, but it serves to advance the other threads so it's fine). Take the opening scene of the movie. Faced with the problem of introducing such a huge cast, Anderson decides to \"dive right in\" and brings us to a nightclub where the entire cast is partying. We don't exactly meet anybody during this scene, as the camera just floats from booths to the dancefloor to the kitchen and back around, and we overhear out-of-context blurts from the characters as we pass them much as we would were we walking through the club ourselves. However, the blurts are revealing--Luis Guzman wants Burt Reynolds to put him in a film someday. Don Cheadle's fashion sense is questionable. Julianne Moore is like a mother to Heather Graham. William Macy is more concerned with business details than the carefree Reynolds. By the end of the scene we feel like we have a pretty reasonable grasp on the scene these people run in.This speaks to Anderson's other great strength as a filmmaker--his writing. People often talk about his camera and how it relates him to his idols like Scorsese and Oph\u00fcls, but rarely mentioned is his ability to create wonderful characters. Boogie Nights, like another great ensemble, Robert Altman's Nashville, is a movie that really feels lived-in. We do not for a second doubt that these are real people, and they occupy our imagination long after the runtime is up. The movie is bursting at the seams with life. Anderson is anything but a lazy filmmaker. He loads the characters with traits that might not seem \"essential\" to a lesser writer, but end up giving the characters the necessary human qualities to make the story really touching. Would Boogie Nights be as moving if Mark Wahlberg wasn't obsessed with karate, and didn't pump himself up by doing punching exercises in front of the mirror before porn shoots? Or if John C Reilly and Don Cheadle didn't have ambitions of becoming a magician and a stereo equipment salesman, respectively? I think not. Boogie Nights is a classic film in the same sense as The Godfather--the filmmaker takes us into a world unknown to most of us, one many of us might think unsavory, and creates a truly moving piece of human drama. And like Nashville, it being so full of life makes it truly life-affirming. Boogie Nights is one of the few movies that not only makes me feel like I've learned more about human beings, but also makes me truly happy to be one.",

Almost every character in the movie is under some self delusion and can't see themselves as they really are. Jack Horner tells himself he's a \"film maker\" and protests when he has to switch to using video tape, but quickly compromises failing to see that all he really is is a pornographer. Look at the line \"Ever hear of that movie Star Wars? People tell me I look just like Han Solo\" uttered by the highly under rated John C. Reilly (who looks nothing like Harrison Ford obviously). This hidden theme runs throughout the movie in all the characters. There are several great moments if you look for them. Buck, an African-American redneck/cowboy, the most redeeming character, lies to himself throughout the movie, hoping to be accepted for who he is without being judged for going against stereotype and being in porn (he's constantly stating \"I'm an actor\") is forced to compromise in the end to open up his stereo store with the hip-hop style commercial. What is great (and sad) about this movie is that no one really evolves. There is no character arc. Dirk comes back when he hits bottom but not out of any self realization. In the end, they are still self deluded. Hence the reason, in the final scene where Dirk is rehearsing his lines and stands up and unzips showing his rubber phallus repeating his mantra \"I am a star, a star, a bright bright shining star\" the camera doesn't pan up showing Dirks face and we hear the lines while looking at this 13\" fake phallus.

            "content": "Writer/Director Paul Thomas Anderson probes the adult film industry of the 1970s in this classy, but imperfect, fictional story that spans the disco years, beginning in 1977, when porn movies were actually shown in movie houses. Set in the San Fernando Valley of Southern California, the basic plot pivots around Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds), king of adult film-making, who eyes a nightclub busboy named Eddie Adams (Mark Wahlberg). Soon, Eddie morphs into \"Dirk Diggler\", hot-to-trot porn star whose got the goods.But the sprawling plot encompasses a vast array of colorful characters that orbit Horner and Diggler. And therein lies one of the film's problems. The plot is overdone. It's too epical. A lot of fat could have been trimmed from the 180 pages of script and the roughly eighty speaking parts. As is, the film exudes a sense of grandiose self-indulgence.Even so, the film clearly paints porn as a for-profit business, a rather grubby, cold-blooded one at that. Horner's detached perspective insures his product's financial success, if not his workers' emotional needs. Splashy disco music enlivens the entire production, though I could have wished for a better selection of 70s music.Casting is fine, except for Wahlberg. I've seen more convincing looking porn stars-to-be sacking groceries at the local Piggly-Wiggly. Burt Reynolds makes an ideal sleaze seller. And sweet Julianne Moore convinces as a 1970s liberated woman.As much a celebration of 1970s disco culture as a primer on cinematic erotica, \"Boogie Nights\" oozes all the glitter of that era, with colorful costumes and funky production design. As such, it reminds me of \"54\" (1998), a film that is to New York City what \"Boogie Nights\" is to Southern California.Energetic, expansive, and chaotic in tone and plot, \"Boogie Nights\" thematically cautions that 1970s porn \"stars\", though superficially attractive, took too seriously their star status, myopic to the reality that times change, and that youth is fleeting.",

The story starts when Jack introduces himself to 17 year old high school drop-out Eddie Adams in San Fernando Valley nightclub after hearing rumors that Eddie is 14\" long in the \"Mr. Torpedo\" area.At the same time we are introduced Rollergirl (Heather Graham), a high schooler already making a career as a porn star & Amber Waves (Julianne Moore), a 30 something cocaine addict who lost visitation rights to her young son because of her chosen career. Over the course of the next few days Eddie moves out of home after a fight with his mother and into Jack's house. Where we are introduced via a party to the rest of the characters including Reed Rothchild (John C. Reilly) The Current king of Jack's stable, Buck (Don Cheadle), is the only character in the film who sees a life for himself outside of porn, Scotty J. (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) a young, overweight, gay man and Little Bill (William H. Macy) whose wife seems to be screwing anybody who isn't him.Before long Eddie has become Dirk Diggler, the biggest thing to have ever hit the porn industry, not suprisingly he quickly starts to falling into the trappings of his own success, introduced, via Amber to cocaine and becoming too big for his own boots, he falls, hard. The people around Eddie are falling too but they always stick by one another. All the performances in this film are stellar but it is Moore's Amber Waves and Cheadle's Buck that standout as truly stunning, P.T Anderson has written a brilliant screenplay complemented by his great direction.

Other people tell him he has \"something special\" and so does Jack Horner, a pornographic filmmaker who wants to make actual quality movies with the pornography still in it. This movie shows what the business was like in the 70s and it shows a star go through his rise to fame to his downfall in the 80s. Every one gives a great performance including a early role for Marky Mark himself. The writing is also a great thing in this movie with a little bit of comedy sprinkled in. Every character is interesting from Burt Reynolds, Julianne Moore, and Don Cheadle. If your a P.T. Anderson fan then I don't see why someone would dislike this, he carry's over a handful of the cast that was in Hard Eight and uses a lot from this film to Magnolia and so on. Every aspect about this movie I think is great from it really feeling like the 70s time period from the costume and set design to the really good soundtrack that sounds like one Tarantino would put together. Highly recommend and Don't get scared by the running time, it flys by for me at least",

Paul Thomas Anderson pays homage to a host of brilliant directors like Martin Scorsese, Stanley Kubrick, Robert Altman, and Quentin Tarantino to guide his camera and volt forward, his supreme storytelling style. With a plot that involves the trials and tribulations of everyone involved in the adult film world, Boogie Nights has a cast here that is full of interesting, quirky characters, it has a couple of enthralling (not to mention elaborate) steadicam shots, and it possesses a soundtrack that tracks gleefully, the rhythms of all the fabulous, energized jump cuts. Mark Wahlberg as the lead and well hung male adult actor (Dirk Diggler), gives a startling, breakthrough performance. But it's Burt Reynolds who bests him as his go-to porn director. Burt's star never shined so bright as it did here (and this is over a 50 plus year career). Look for a drug deal scene gone amuck, a donut shop scene posing as a Mexican standoff, and a disco dance sequence that gives you your Saturday Night Fever fix.Overall, this is what invigorating, epic, staunch film making is all about.

            "content": "A first film in Paul Thomas Anderson's California Suite (all taking place in California). It shows that the director has studied Scorsese carefully: long tracking shots, period disco music, but the characters seem to come with the laid-back California lifestyle. More than that if conveys the mentality of the era.What could be more interesting than a film about the porn industry; but it's really about the film industry, with it's star behavior, drugs, bored, behind the camera people going through the motions and its share of misfits hoping for a bit of glamour. Its a comedy until toward the end it isn't, and the butchers bill comes for people who play meat on camera.The film skillfully evokes an era and a time (starting with the mid-seventies) when making porn was almost a family affair, and those who came to Hollywood seeking their fortunes find that paying the bills leads them to the productions of Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds in his best role) a pornographer. It'd a transitional period in which the standard sex scene are still played, not the hard core stuff that goes nowadays.One of the best scenes shows Jack Horner's girlfriend, a porn performer, gets it on with a boy she really wants to make love to, and does it on camera right before Horner, who thinks it's a wonderful 'performance'.Boogie Nights also interweaves the lives of dozens of characters, who try to communicate things they can't articulate, so that even the most obvious double-entendre is taken seriously. They're way over their heads, playing with fire, and don't know it.Unless your older, you won't remember eight-track tape, HI-FI systems, bell bottoms, disco, Corvettes as status symbols, coke on everyone's coffee tables, or a dozen other period artifacts.I think the film is great if you've not seen it before. I tried watching it a second time and fount it a bit confining, as almost all the action takes place at Jack Horner's home or a disco named 'Boogie Nights'. The few scenes that don't seem shoehorned in, and don't work.If the acting seems bad, remember that the film wants the characters to be stupid... like the characters in a porn movie. The length of the film (you won't be bored) promises larger ideas than the film finally delivers, and that is that. No big message, and maybe that's a good thing.I recommend it highly if you haven't seen it. Just remember this is deeply ironic and humorous film - don't take anything seriously and you'll have a good time.",

He knows how to take a character and flesh them out so that they all seem to have urges, dreams, cares, and fears about the world that Anderson places them in, and in giving these characters more depth, the world feels far more tactile. The character relationships shift and change as things happen throughout the movie. Almost every character in this movie is dynamic- when we're introduced to them in the beginning, they're one way, and by the time we leave them, they're different. What's so impressive about this film is the way that Anderson works in all of the different character arcs without making the story feel overly complex, complicated, or an hour too long (there are some scenes in this movie that probably could've been trimmed, but for a two and a half hour film, it seems to move quickly). While the main story revolves around Eddie/Dirk's rise to fame, this movie is essentially an ensemble piece- we spend time getting to know each and every character in their own separate scenes, fleshing out the members of the adoptive family that Dirk joins. I do want to mention, that while I think this script is great, I'd say that Anderson's later scripts show a lot more complexity and depth.",

For a while, Paul Thomas Andersson's Boogie Night's recalls Goodfellas; a subjective story about a nobody who becomes a big somebody. Unfortunately Andersson is not content with the movie being that simple. He wants to make it bigger and bolder, and about halfway in, it turns into an ensemble feature. The whole thing doesn't come together very well. The plot grows increasingly stagy, and the characters are given no room to grow. Where as Goodfellas grew tighter and more intense with each chapter, Boogie Nights grows tiresome. Its self-indulgence is frustrating because for a while I was really enjoying myself. But just when things are looking good, Boogie Nights ceases to commit to the direction it started with, so why should we stay committed?.",

            "review_title": "Boogie Nights, a real \"star\"",
            "content": "All most all the characters in `Boogie Nights' that are not involved in the porn industry call the industry just that (`porn', `porn star', etc.), while almost all the characters within the industry call their art film and themselves actors.  As accurately depicted in `Boogie Nights', this highlights one of the key reasons why a transaction from theater porn to video porn occurred in the late 70's and early 80's.  Unlike what the delusional directors of the time (Jack) believed, people pretty much only went to porno movies in theaters to do their business and then get out. The plot, though, never takes us to the theaters.  Rather, it follows the bigger-then-life lifestyle of porn industry insiders in the 70's through their tremendous fall from grace in the early and mid 80's, and finally into there initiation into normal society in the (presumably) late 80's and early 90's.  This gives `Boogie Nights' an epic quality; a peculiar occurrence considering it follows an `unclean' business.  Although an epic quality exists, no one scene is particularly breath taking (as compared to classical epics), but in reverse fashion, actually very bland.This leads to another key quality of PT Anderson's film, in that he takes sex, and depicts the mundane quality it has within the porn industry. Some of the sex scenes with Rollergirl seem to be so spontaneous and casual that it seems as if the porn films are just an extension of real life.  Of course when an outside influence (video) topples this `great society' everyone falls off the deep end.  This fall primarily takes the form of Cocaine (Dirk, Rollergirl, Amber, Reed, et al.), though, alternatively, Little Bill kills himself, and Jack just accepts the change despite the fact that he is obviously not as happy.  During the years between 1980 and 1984, the only characters who seems to gain or even maintain happiness are Buck and Jessie St. Vincent.  The fall culminates with the scene at Rahad Jackson's house. At the end, though, almost everyone is redeemed (i.e. Rollergirl gets her degree, Amber becomes a legitimate director, Reed goes on a magic card circuit, Buck opens his own sound performance store, there are parties once again at Jack's house, Maurice opens his own night club, and of course Eddie becomes a legitimate actor.).  The phoenix-like end crescendo's with the Eddies final monologue where he states, `I am a star. I'm a star, I'm a star, I'm a star. I am a big, bright, shining star.'The budget for this film was perfect.  If Anderson were given any more money, the studios would have been all over him demanding a `safer' film to protect their investment.  Although the film probably could have been done for less, it would have been impossible to do it for much less considering the elaborate set design and the (quasi) star studded cast (i.e. no Brad Pitts but plenty of high paid actors).   As it is, this movie was probably done on about the perfect budget.The film also hit the mark when it comes to the actual final product. Anderson stated on the DVD that he would have liked to expand the mother-son scenes a little further, which I agree would have been productive.  I would have also expanded Dirks fall from grace. In my version Dirk would be depicted as an isolated (not even Scotty J or Reed are there anymore) homeless, starving bum on a decrepit Hollywood Ave. (irony?), for 1 or 2 scenes before he finally get around to contacting Jack again.  With the movie already being 2 hours and 40 minuts, these additional scenes might begin to make the movie a little excessive. It is of my opinion that although a few scenes could have been added, there are really no scenes that could have been subtracted.  The film follows a number of different story lines, meaning that if one story line is deleted it won't ruin plot of the film.  This being said, I feel that all the story lines help add to the `feel' of the film and if any were deleted, the quality of the film would be lessened.All in all `Boogie Nights' is a great, epic film, which would be hard to re-edit for the purpose of improved changes.",

This film stars a brilliant ensemble cast in what may seem like a solid non- documentary examination of the pornographic industry during the 1970s but is actually an inside look at the characters' adventures through the controversial entertainment business. With the stylish script, direction, and realistic depiction of the social satire in the 70s by Anderson; this film comes be a sassy and powerfully clever picture. Set in San Fernando Valley, California in the late 70s, this film introduces Eddie Adams (played by Mark Wahlberg), a seventeen-year old high school dropout who spends his nights working as a bus boy at the Reseda Night Club. There he meets adult film director Jack Horner (played by Burt Reynolds) who sees talent in the young man. After a meeting with Horner, his star Amber Waves (played by Julianne Moore), and a young runaway named Brandy (played by Heather Graham) nicknamed \"Rollergirl\", Eddie is driven into the eccentric world of the porn industry where he meets actors Reed Rothchild (played by John C. Reilley), producer Little Bill (played by William H. Macy) who struggles with his wife's infidelity, and music executive Bucky Swope (played by Don Cheadle). Adopting his stage name Dirk Diggler, Eddie ventures through the highs and unexpected lows of the Californian porn industry.From the exhilarating screenplay by Paul Thomas Anderson, the sassy disco soundtrack and costume design to represent the 70s (and 80s) settings, and the ambitious performances by the cast; it is easy to consider this Anderson's career-defining entry. Venturing through the lives of the characters and their ups and downs in the adult film business including infidelity and troubled fame, this film delivers plenty of surprises and wit from the hands of director Anderson, and the story falls nothing short of engaging and sweet, though it feels somewhat uneven in the second half. Of course, as pornography serves as the central point of the story, there is a heavy amount of sexual activity, raucous dialogue, nudity, and abundance of cocaine abused throughout, let's not forget the unexpected violence that breaks out between certain scenes; all of which can be significantly uncomfortable for sensitive movie-goers to sit through. But thanks to the stylish cinematography by Robert Elswit and the sharply written dialogue, it's all done in a way not meant to be gratuitous. When the story suspends from it's emotional heft, viewers are granted with some hilarious (and vulgar) dialogue, slick social commentary, and light- hearted gags, mostly from the mouths of Mark Wahlberg and Burt Reynolds, both of whom are deeply engaging in their roles; standing out from the overcrowd of underdeveloped characters. Though Paul Thomas Anderson may suffer a bad case of \"ensemble cast syndrome\" that results in some characters that fall shallow, his stylish quality in filmmaking and writing are effective enough to shade over these flaws.Boogie Nights is a smart, provocative piece of work that can be called one of the best films made by the hands of Paul Thomas Anderson. This film is full or surprises and intelligence that scale high above its vulgarity and rawness. Though this doesn't pack the same kind of popular status as other 90s film like Quentin Tarantino's 'Pulp Fiction' or James Cameron 'Titanic', it makes an important piece of modern cinema.",

The writing is superb.  Original characters and situations that come from an original filmmaker.  The drug deal at the end is one of THE best scenes in cinema history.  Alfred Molina prancing around with a crack pipe, singing along to \"Jesse's Girl\", while his Chinese friend throws firecrackers around the room, causing Dirk, Todd and Reed to jump out of their seats is just a pure movie moment and is worth the price of the DVD alone.  It doesn't happen often, but when it does, the music, the images, the acting, the subject matter... it all blends into the perfect movie experience and Boogie Nights has all that in spades.",

This movie just happens to be about the Porn industry in the late 70's-early 1980's. When I first saw this when the film just came out, the only person I recognized in the cast was of course, Burt Reynolds and that rapper-turned-actor, Mark Wahlberg. Nowadays, I can recognize everyone and just be agog at how much pre-starpower there is: Julianne Moore, Heather Graham, John C, Mcginley, Don Cheadle, William Maxy, Phillip Seymour Hoffman etc etc, This film just gets better and better with each viewing, and the firecracker scene at the ending becomes more hilarious then nerve wracking ( not that it doesn't lose it's power - After maybe 3-4 viewings, I always forget the conclusion of this scene, which increases it's brilliance because it's the firecrackers you remember, and it keeps you wondering.. what happens after this?",

In a sense, this film tells the story of the late 70's becoming the early 80's, and uses the porn industry to do so. It's closest point of comparison is \"Nashville\". Both films use a web of vividly drawn characters in an unlikely industry to paint a portrait of where America was in a specific time and place.Where it really doesn't feel like \"Nashville\" is in it's determination to dazzle the viewer. Anderson really lets loose with some amazing things ... long unbroken takes, dropping from a 4-way split screen into a dance number, homages to \"I Am Cuba\" and \"Raging Bull\". It all works.It's also meticulously cast. Mark Wahlberg and Burt Reynolds turn in career best performances. A huge supporting cast of character actors are all perfectly cast. Alfred Molina almost steals the whole film. Robert Downey, Sr. Even pops up.All of this could feel like an exercise if it wasn't grounded in a subtle and warm portrayal of an extended family of sometimes deeply flawed people that draws you in and makes care about them. This would be a career peak for most directors, but it's really just Anderson's first volley.",

The movie generates a surprising amount of sympathy and even a kind of grudging respect for (some of) them.  My favorite line occurs in a scene where Burt Reynolds, who has always worked with \"professional\" actors to shoot his porn flicks on celluloid, decides reluctantly to explore the possibilities of the new video medium and takes his leading actress, \"Rollergirl\" a blond who never takes off her skates even when she takes everything else off, out in a stretch limo to film her having sex with random volunteers picked up off the streets.  This goes badly wrong when they pick up a snotty college boy who recognizes her as a high school classmate and tries to have sex with her without any of the usual (even in porn films) conversational preliminaries, and without paying any attention to suggestions from Mr Reynolds about taking his time and enjoying himself a bit.  After a final indignant expostulation from Reynolds, \"Hey, show a little respect, this is Rollergirl!\" the college snot is unceremoniously dumped out of the car. \nWell worth your time.",

The movie really is talking about hope and finding dreams among broken people through the lens of the pornography industry.Like my previous PTA movie, \"Boogie Nights\" presents the audience with effective establishment of characters right from the get go. Mark Wahlberg definitely stood out for this film and maybe many will consider this his best (unfortunately) because before this movie, I saw him as sort of B-list action movie star. Other performances from casts like Reynolds, Moore, Cheadle and Reilly were all strong. The movie gets even better towards the end. The scenes where the characters are shown hitting their rock bottom in sequence was terrific. The drug selling scene also kept me on my toes. The firecracker plot was honestly genius.In technical aspects, I thought the music choice was superb and the whole movie did really feel like a great homage to the 70s and the early 80s. There weren't a lot of fancy \"wow\" shots but the overall cinematography was just as smooth as butter.I didn't find the movie very comedic but it felt really special because I had never seen anything like it. The characters are bunch of broken people but endearing in many aspects. So as they go through the vanity of it all, the ups and downs of the seemingly glamorous industry, the audience can't help but follow their journey with observant eyes. In unexplainable ways, the movie tucks on the audiences' heartstring in a mature way because everyone has failed and gotten better at some point in their lives. Come to think of it, maybe the pornography industry is the best to showcase the inner struggles that these characters go through in contrast to their external glory.Overall, a beautiful PTA movie yet again. Perhaps I might fanboy him.",

(What's your talent? Good at math?) It is exciting to see how ,somewhere, there is a whole world of happiness and misery surrounding the making of porn movies. The 70's atmosphere is simply great! The parties, the music, the drugs, the clothes and the people, they're all there. A lot of scenes have outstanding acting performances(see below)and some are very sexy. Also you will find many interesting little characters surrounding the main players.Why not: The movie is pretty long and not all scenes are acted that well. The 70's theme you've probably already seen a lot of times. The characters in the movie are (on purpose) mostly pretty simple minded, so don't expect many interesting thoughts.\nActors/actresses: In most scenes Mark Wahlberg does an excellent job playing Dirk Diggler that pursues a career as porn star trying to find some affection that he didn't even get from his own mom. He desperately wants to be popular. When the story gets more dramatic he's at his best. Heather Graham has the easy part of just being a sexy Rollergirl, which isn't hard to screw up. It probably worked out well for her career, as a lot of sexy roles do for actresses. Burt Reynolds is wonderful in his character of the director of the movies and being the patron of the \"porn-family\". He looks like Sean Connery and secretly you would like to be in his little porn world for a couple of days too. Julianne Moore completes this world. She brilliant in the short scene about the custody of her child. And ,of course,very sexy as the woman de la famille and performing porn star. Notice Philipp Seymour Hoffman's role as the crew member who's secretly in love with Dirk Diggler.Other observations: The story of Boogie Nights is like that of Casino or Goodfellas, but then for the sex industry.Conclusion: As I said, the 70's setting and the many small scenes that characterize this period are simply great! With often wonderful acting. (8)",

            "content": "P.T Anderson hit the Hollywood scene in 1997 with \"Hard Eight\" and \"Boogie Nights\". But it was \"Boogie Nights\" that launched his career into the mainstream, and earned him several Oscar nominations. But it was robbed, BIG TIME, for at least a nomination for best picture. \"Boogie Nights\" is hands down one of the best American movies in the last 25 years. P.T Anderson is an undeniable master of drama, and he (really) should stand among the ranks of Tarentino and Scorsese. The way he weaved this tumultuous narrative was groundbreaking for any filmmaker of the time. The story is essentially a young man finally finding the love and affection he always needed from a new family. The only problem is, this family is in the smut business. It's a story as provocative as the centerfold of a Hustler magazine, but as thought provoking as \"Citizen Kane\". The performances are some of the best I've ever seen. Mark Wahlberg's screen debut as Dirk Diggler is arguably his best performance to date. Burt Reynolds is captivating as Jack Horner, the pornographer who dreams of making Oscar gold. Julianne Moore deserved her Oscar for her performance of Amber Waves, a former mother who finds her sense of family with the people she sleeps with, and not with the children she birthed. Also, you've got Heather Graham as Rollergirl, Don Cheadle, the always funny John C. Reilly, the even funnier Phillip Seymour Hoffman. Then, you have William H. Macy as Little Bill, or what can only be described as the ultimate cuckold. His shattering performance ranks with Steve Buscemi's Donny from \"The Big Lebowski\" as one of the funniest characters in all of film. Who else could forget the scene at the drug dealers house with the firecrackers and the\u0085.? OK for those of you who haven't seen the movie yet, I might be getting ahead of myself. I just get so excited talking about this film! Its scenes like that that make the entire film an unforgettable experience. This film clocks in at 155 minutes which is precisely one minute longer than Pulp Fiction, but like Pulp Fiction, every minute is enthralling. Its the greatest 2 and 1/2 hours you could possibly spend on Netflix. My love for this movie grows every time I think about it, and I want to share that love with all of you. Enjoy!",

While many of his `regular' actors (Julianne Moore, John C. Reilly, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Phillip Baker Hall and Ricky Jay among them) are excellent actors in their own right, he squeezes hilarious, ironic and gut-wrenching performances from them. Probably the most effective performance of course is by Mark Wahlberg. While this was not his first film, it was his first starring role and when the film was over he was `Marky-Mark' no more.  A lot has been said about this film, and there are far too many reasons to mention to illustrate why this film has very solidly remained in my top 15 favorite films of all time, but one scene I would like to mention is the scene near the end of the film between Wahlberg, Reilly, Thomas Jane and Alfred Molina.  Set in Molina's living room and involving a drug deal, Anderson directs this scene with such incredible finesse that it goes down in history as one of the greatest moments in the last thirty years of film. Between the palpable tension, the brilliant choice of music and the unbelievable acting by the primaries, this scene is important to watch more than once to experience how a scene should be written and blocked to tell a story with both unflinching imagery and subtlety at the same time.  I will see a mediocre movie and then put on this scene after to renew my faith in *good* filmmaking.This is obviously not a film for everyone due to its subject matter, but it is such an incredible and important film, it should not be overlooked.--Shelly",

When I wanted to study movie directing, now famous film director Jasmila Zbanic said that I can not study since I watch too much porn???!!!??? First of all how did she find out that? Well I assume because Sarajevo was during my teen years and still is such a small town that all the owners of the VHS rentals of those times knew each other and shared information of customers interests. Zbanic owned one of the VHS rental places but she never had porn films for rent. Her mother was a big Muslim believer and she would not permit anything of that in her store. I rented those films from a different VHS rental places and she still found out. So to make the long story short twists and turns of history turned us so Zbanic became award winning film director, while I hm, became a IMDb amateur reviewer.I am so glad Ron Jeremy contributed to this film, he is such a great guy! I met him once briefly, very nice guy. Philip Seymour acted in this film. One more time R.I.P.Now this is a must see! Film portrays adult film industry well.

Well, guess what. The characters in the film are loathsome, their lives get destroyed, and it made me fell as miserable as watching the downward spiral in \"Leaving Las Vegas\" (where at least the characters were interesting and well-acted).I was not looking for a good story, good acting, good much of anything.

(There is a quick shot of Heather Graham.)Who should see this film:-- Nobody, even if you think you might want to.I'll give \"Boogie Nights\" a generous 2 out of 10 for Heather Graham's sake.",

            "content": "Paul Thomas Anderson is renowned for making weighty films filled with masterful directing, writing and acting. There Will Be Blood (my first taste of PTA) almost immediately became one of my top five favourites, resembling one of Stanley Kubrick's very best. I gave Magnolia a watch more recently and the whole thing astounded me with its emotional depth and richness. I'd been saving up Boogie Nights as many consider it Paul's greatest film. At a mere 26 years old, he created a critically-acclaimed masterpiece that blew his debut (which is still a pretty good film) out of the water. I couldn't wait to give Boogie Nights a watch and it didn't disappoint.I know it's not a popular opinion, but I still think There Will Be Blood and Magnolia are far better than Boogie Nights. However, that just shows how talented our Paul is as a filmmaker because Boogie Nights is a seriously terrific achievement right from the opening sombre music. We're then hit immediately by a blasting 70's pop track and a sweeping camera which takes us into the mind of Madonna when she was working on Confessions on a Dancefloor. A beautiful retro disco with all the main characters being introduced with perfect camera timing I don't know how Paul managed to do it but it's a fantastic piece of camera-work and it almost feels as though he's showing off a bit.The film is a rags to riches tale, with more than a touch of irony to it, of a young and na\u00efve dishwasher who's whisked away by Burt Reynolds to become the biggest porn star there's ever been! The first half is the more entertaining and funny half. It's full of infectious energy and memorable characters who jump off the screen. For a film about the porn industry, there's surprisingly little smut aside from an extended sequence where Mark Whalberg films his first sex scene with Julianne Moore. It's extremely lively and full of fab scenes such as another impressive Steadicam move around a pool party and a fun montage showing Dirk Diggler's rise to pornographic stardom.The darker, second half is the more interesting one for me. We're suddenly plunged into the 80's and watch as everyone's lives go spiralling towards hell. The once friendly Dirk has turned into an egotistical cocaine-addict and Burt Reynolds has become a desperate director pimping his surrogate daughter out to strangers on the street. It's a sad chapter which adds weight and morality to the tale. The film could've been a terrific comedy in the vein of the Wolf of Wall Street, but the second half offers a lovely bleak balance and shows us that pornography is not an industry to aspire to get into. The seemingly fulfilled characters become much deeper and more tragic figures.There are some lovely scenes. One sequence which I really loved was a montage where all the characters are at their lowest. The music suited the scene so well and it felt very unsettling and intense. I also liked the moment where we're given a glimpse into Julianne Moore's life as she discusses getting custody of her child with her ex-husband. The film stops being fun and starts to become a much more serious beast set in a real world more closer to our own. Boogie Nights handles its many characters so expertly, kind of in the same way Magnolia did, although to a slightly lesser extent.Just when you think the film can't throw up any more brilliance, the best scene pops up towards the end. It involves Dirk's pathetic gang trying to orchestrate a drug deal at Alfred Molina's house. Everything about this scene is pretty much perfect from the acting to the music to the tense, unpredictable atmosphere. Even the firecrackers are a masterstroke! It erupts into a Quentin Tarantino styled shootout and the unpredictability of it all makes for a thrilling watch. In fact, the entire film is filled with so many terrific scenes that it makes for a very high rewatchability factor.My only complaint would be that, like Dirk's manhood, it's quite overlong. I think I would've preferred more of a focus on the 80's segment rather than the 70's. However, Boogie Nights is still a really great film. The thing that stands out the most is the masterful directing by the young Paul Thomas Anderson. Some argue that it's a Martin Scorsese rip-off but I'd argue that his style is even better than Martin Scorsese. It's a fantastic ride which leaves you with a lot to ponder about. So get your glad rags on and hit the dancefloor kids!",

And, like with most gangster films, the first half of Boogie Nights is a feast for the eyes and ears. Anderson lets the camera swoop through one entertaining scene after the other, accompanied by a terrific soundtrack. All actors are in top form but it is Burt Reynolds that steals the show as a totally believable porn director. The second half of the film is less impressive. The story at times gets too far fetched (the Molina cameo although great, the scene is a bit too much), too Hollywoodesque and subplots (like Cheadle's) that are not interesting only distract from the main plot. First half an 8, second half a 5. So a 6,5 is my final verdict.",

Dirk then goes into the porn industry and his life gets turned upside down.It is a very entertaining story and very easy to follow. I would say this movie was a comedy. There were a lot of funny moments in it, as well as other serious moments, which gave it an element of drama.The cast list was amazing. I knew a few of these people were in it, but I didn't realise this many famous people were acting in it. The film starred Mark Wahlberg, the legendary Burt Reynolds, Julianne Moore, Heather Graham, John C. Reilly, Don Cheadle, William H. Macy & Phillip Seymour Hoffman.Everyone did an amazing job. It is not surprising that this film and the actors were nominated for so many awards, and even won a lot too.It felt like a bit or a roller coaster of a film. The emotions of the movie were all over the place. One minute I was laughing, then something would happen and it just shocked me. The drama kicked in... but then the comedy would come back.The film was set in the 70s and 80s... the clothes and hair was great. and the film also has a pretty good soundtrack.There was a lot of nudity in the film too. I don't know why I was surprised at this. After all, the film is about the porn industry... but for some reason I was shocked to see all these Hollywood actors and actresses flashing it all... and as for Mark Whalberg... he wishes his dong was that big! haha. Apparently, the fake willy that you saw at the end of the movie was given to Mark Wahlberg when filming was finished... he still owns it to this day... but it is not in the same condition anymore. haha.I will give this film 7 out of 10.I really liked it, and it really put me in a time machine and took me back to the 70s/80s. :)For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",

So, here are five simple reasons why it's one of the greatest films of, if not simply the 90's, the last 40-50 years of cinema:1. Potentially the greatest ensemble cast put before a camera (Hoffman, Hall, Guzman, Moore, Macy, Reilly, Reynolds, Wahlberg, Cheadle, etc.)2. Absolutely the most danceable soundtrack that can double as a time capsule of the greatest dance hits of the 70's.3. Any film that can generate enough quotes to be used extensively in an ESPN.com article as allegories for the NBA and NOT be a film about basketball is a sign of a golden script. (By the way, the article I speak of, \"Boogie Hoops,\" is hilarious.) Say any line from this movie at a party loud enough, and you'll have another shouted back. Go on. Do it.4. It shows, in raw, realistic fashion, the classic hero arc--and set against the contrasting values of the 70's and 80's, no less.5. It makes you care about the characters without telling you that you have to.(Bonus Reasons: 6. Any film that includes the song \"You Got the Touch\"--originally from \"Transformers: The Movie\"--needs to be bowed down to. 7. Heather Graham.)",

You'd also want to disregard reviews done by horny people who \"dug\" this one because \"there was nudity GALORE!!!  I LOVE PORN!!!\"  Because not only is this movie NOT a porno,  it's not about SEX, SEX, SEX!!!  Granted this movie is set entirely within the shadowy culture of the adult-film industry of the 1970s, and there are a couple (no more) scenes of nudity and simulated sex acts, but this movie is not about that.  They are simply plot devices.  The movie is about people who have dreams...dreams,  goals,  desires to better their lives,  and appearing in adult movies is simply a pitstop on their road to \"better-ness\".  Eddie Adams (Mark Wahlberg---remarkable performance!!!) is an innocent (I mean just that) 17 year old from Torrance who commutes all the way to Hollywood every night to bus tables at Boogie Nights,  a disco club.  Why would he want to work miles from home when there are plenty of bus jobs in Torrance???  Because Eddie has dreams--to be a star,  to be rich,  to be loved,  to get away from Torrance and the mother who doesn't love him.  He meets Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds) in the disco hot-spot,  and the company Jack keeps:  Beautiful Amber Waves,  a porn vet played by Julianne Moore;  Reed Rothchild (John C. Reilly);  and a girl who is equally as young and innocent as Eddie,  The Rollergirl (Heather Graham).  Eddie sees a kinship in the fact that Jack,  Amber and Rollergirl have been tossed by the wayside by their families.  They have dreams too,  of money,  stardom and a better life up the road.  This movie is a portrait of this handful of throwaway refugees,  their humanity,  their frailness,  the raw open wounds that are exposed in their lives,  evident despite their ritzy homes and glitzy '70s disco attire.  You'd think such people who shed their clothes and perform sexual acts for money would be jaded to the point of zombie-like indifference,  but this movie presents the reality that the real person in all their painful soul is under the rubble somewhere,  and no amount of drugs or alcohol can keep it buried indefinitely.  Those people looking for the typical pointless porn-flick with close-up copulation,  augmented breasts,  blond wigs and zero personality in the characters will be let down by Boogie Nights.  Those looking for a great movie experience combining wan humor with extraordinary human drama should be more than satisfied with this movie.  I also loved the assortment of '70s rock and disco songs too!!! **** out of **** stars.  I also recommend Gia and The People Vs. Larry Flynt for character studies of misunderstood characters.",

I dare say there's a few who will read this who will argue they would out of sheer ideological defiance; but the majority of parents wouldn't like their children to be exposed to moral filth.Boogie Nights is an amoral movie - by that, I mean that it is a semi-docudrama screenplay about a young man's entry into the porn-industry and the chaos and upheaval that lifestyle creates in both his and other peoples' lives without providing any moral perspective. Throughout the movie, the only people who object are narrow-minded bigots, and those who embrace it are intelligent and enlightened.Yet, it depicts a movie-making scene peopled by morally-ambiguous characters, who swing and sleep around despite being married, and are entangled in pornographic pursuits to one degree or another. This has got to be - yet again - another example of Hollywood money thrown at a movie to reinforce relativistic, amoral values and mock principles and anyone who lives by them.All the actors deliver utterly convincing roles, along with all their fetishes and sexual openness. The movie portrays victims of the porn-industry along with its winners. The only thing it fails to show is the absolute consequences, and those who suffer consequences do so only by virtue of being caught in the act.",

            "content": "BOOGIE NIGHTS tells a lie, a big fat whopper of a lie. You know it's lying and it probably knows its lying. But you listen to the lie and are mesmerized by it, because it is a sad, dreamy lie. It's like the uncle who talks about what coulda-shoulda-woulda happened had he not started drinking, or the cousin who wistfully tells of what she plans to do once she wins the lottery. It's a lie you come to believe in because, well, it's just nicer and easier that way.The big lie in BOOGIE NIGHTS is the whole concept of the story. The film is about making porn films in the 1970's. The film somewhat romantically suggests that the ragtag band of filmmakers involved at this one little studio are somehow a family. They also believe they are creating art as pa rt of a family business. The film almost makes you believe it too. The idea that the porn industry is basically opportunistic and exploitive is somehow tucked away in a corner somewhere, vaguely visible, but never pointed out or discussed. To do so would interfere with the sense of community that exists between the characters. And the characters need that feigned innocence in order to justify the way they survive.Don't get me wrong, I have no moral qualms about porn -- to each is own -- but I don't have any delusions either. Porn is a business as cold and impersonal as the sex it depicts. Some pornographic filmmakers may, indeed, take pride in their work and strive to make the best films possible, but that is like striving to make the best hotdog possible. Porn is a product, ground out for fast and easy consumption. And the people who work in porn do it for the money, or to satisfy their own particular sexual kink, or because, well, they haven't anything better to do with their lives. I just don't believe that a life in porn is something anyone aspires to, let alone turns to for social acceptance.But for a few hours watching BOOGIE NIGHTS, you simply accept the lie, just as the characters accept the little lies that make up their lives. You believe Mark Wahlberg's Dirk Diggler really believes the he has found his special place in life by using the special gift God as given him. You believe that Heather Graham's Rollergirl believes that she has attained true stardom. You believe that Julianne Moore's Amber Waves is convinced that you can be a drug using porn star and that shouldn't affect your right to have custody of your children. You believe that Burt Reynolds' Jack Horner truly feels he is making \"art\" films. Such is the magic web that Paul Thomas Anderson weaves in his long, meandering and amusing slice of the low life.\nAlas, reality sets in and naturally things go awry. Everyone must face their lies and the film's characters have to pay. Ironically, the film itself replaces its central lie with an even bigger one: Anderson's Altmanesque epic of off beat reality suddenly gets sidetracked near the end and becomes a Tarantino-like mess of lurid plot twists. The dream world of casual sex becomes an unconvincing nightmare world of violence. The film gains its footing again at the end, but this large chunk of BOOGIE NIGHTS is just unbearably bad. Sex and violence become bedfellows. Anderson loses faith in his lie, just as his characters do.But when it is good -- in a sexually naughty sort of way -- the film is most endearing. Anderson explores a world rarely even acknowledged in polite circles and introduces an intriguing cast of characters. Reynolds possibly gives his best screen performance as the film's father figure and he is backed by a fine cast, especially Wahlberg in the role that moved him into the realm of stardom.A secondary, but relevant, theme in the story is the love of film as a medium. Like ED WOOD and BOWFINGER, BOOGIE NIGHTS celebrates the basic allure of making films, regardless of how questionable the finished movies might be. In a strange way, this is where the film's real honesty lies. A turning point in the film is the realization that film as a community event is fading. Tape and video are forever altering the way films are made and seen. Adult theatres, like the neighborhood movie house, are facing doom as video moves film from the public to the private sector. In wistfully mourning the passing of \"classic porn,\" the film makes a statement about the way technology has demystified cinema: efficient multiplexes have shut down the movie palaces, VCR and DVD changed movie watching from something special to something banal, computer effects are passed off as drama, and anyone with a video camera can be a director.I guess one could be offended that Anderson uses pornography as a metaphor for all that film represents, but then again he wouldn't be the first. But in the end, he uses the alternate universe of the skin trade to make a profound and insightful observation about an art form. What begins as a lie becomes the truth.",

Unfortunately the screenplay carries quite a lot of dead weight. Too many characters, somewhat uniform individual destinies and, above all, a sickeningly moralistic message that really does great harm to the whole thing. All the main characters are flawed \u0096 as if there was a certain logic to it, which just isn't true. It is not true that because you participate in a porno movie you become a cocaine addict and ruin your family. The movie nearly suggests as much. There is a scene in which the character Don Cheadle plays steals money after a hold up. It is totally unnecessary for the story and stupid because the essential message of the incident is that he is an immoral guy anyway, so why should he care. The ending, when all return to Horner's \"ashram\", is puzzling and irritating. Are they all a big, loving family or what? Equally irritating are the contrived camera angles and movements which are not really motivated and don't provide additional viewing pleasure.So I think Boogie Nights is generally overrated. I regret that the director did not stick to the core of the story. Because it is a really good story \u0096 these people want to make something out of themselves, they want to be somebody. Not only do they want to make money, they dream of being true artists or at least accomplished craftsmen. The force of their apparent willpower causes some really funny scenes and the viewers can sympathize and identify with the characters. The set design is also very good, especially the pool zone of Horner's \"ashram\" is really beautifully filmed. Alfred Molina plays a completely crazy coke addict with a companion who continually throws crackers on the floor. I could recommend the movie for that over-the-top scene alone. All the acting is of the first order.",

            "content": "\"Boogie Nights\" is a classic Hollywood film of dreams and dreamers \u0096 the twist is its set in the porn business of the late seventies and early eighties. Writer director PT Anderson was just 25 when he made this homage - or should that be expose - and the movie shows him experimenting with techniques clearly borrowed from Scorsese and Altman amongst others. What's amazing is that it all comes off confirming his reputation as one of the most exciting young directors to emerge from the nineties.The film follows the life of the creatively named Dirk Diggler (Mark Wahlberg) as he leaves home determined to make it by using the only asset he has \u0096 and it is quite a substantial asset. Along the way we meet the varied characters that inhabit the porn scene, most of whom are introduced in a stunning long take through a nightclub that opens the movie which is reminiscent of both Scorsese's \"Goodfellas\" and Altman's \"The Player\".At 156 minutes this film is very much an epic but Anderson wisely keeps the explicitness to a minimum, making this very much a piece of drama rather than erotica. What we are shown is a world where sex, drugs and money act as substitutes for artistic dreams and emotional need.The large cast produce uniformly excellent performances from Burt Reynolds porn director through cuckolded William H Macy to Jullianne Moore's drug addicted pornstar facing a child custody battle. Anderson handles his large cast with the assuredness of a seasoned veteran none of the characters get short changed by having their story lines abruptly abandoned.Both funny and disturbing in equal measures this is an excellent film, with bravura directing from Anderson and a style that perfectly evokes its setting. If there is a criticism to be made, and it's a harsh one, it's that Anderson occasionally seems too fond of his characters. Don't let the subject matter put you off, this is an excellent film that heralds the rise of a potential new auteur.9/10 - Excellent",

            "content": "When I think of \"Boogie Nights\" three other films come into my mind: Martin Scorcese\u00b4s \"Goodfellas\" and \"Casino\" as well as Abel Ferrera\u00b4s \"King of New York\": almost all movies happen in a period of one, two or three decades and tell the story of men who have it all - power, money, sex and drugs...\"Boogie Nights\" tells the story of a 17 year old country boy who becomes a celebrated porn star at the end of the 70s. But his downfall seems to be inevitable: with the beginning of the 80s and the glory of the videotape his star begins to sink, he becomes a junkie, a male prostitute and his career seems to be ended before it began...Paul Thomas Anderson\u00b4s film is an homage on the spirit of age of the 70s as well as a movie about idealism, about people who believe in their ideas, their visions and themselves. The film contains next to \"Saturday Night Fever\" one of the greatest 70s soundtracks I\u00b4ve ever heard. Only a short time after \"Boogie Nights\" was released a similar movie with nearly the same theme came out: \"54\" starring Ryan Phillipe and Neve Campbell tells the story about the 70s disco-era, glitter, glamour and cocaine. This film has almost the same plot that \"Boogie Nights\" has , but it never reaches the qualities of its predecessor in any way! It is also the great cast which makes Paul Thomas Anderson\u00b4s film being one of the definitely masterpieces of the 90s: especially the great performances of Burt Reynolds (a real surprise!!!), William H. Macy, John C. Reilly, Marky Mark Wahlberg who acts like a young de Niro and Julianne Moore are outstanding!!!A must-see for all those who think the real big cinema is already dead or only consists of soulless moneymakers like \"Pearl Harbor\" or \"Titanic\"!!!!!!10/10",

            "content": "The very beginning of Boogie Nights sets the tone for the entire picture. A melancholy piece of sentimental music plays over a black screen before being quickly drowned out by an explosion of upbeat disco. It's almost as though PT Anderson wanted the audience to feel like they just snorted a line of cocaine. The brilliant tracking shot that follows does a fantastic job of introducing all the characters, but it is that first screen that sets the tone; Boogie Nights is not about the glitz and glamor of its time period, but rather the sadness and desperation that lies beneath the gilded surface.The film follows a well-endowed and starry-eyed teenager named Eddie Adams (Mark Wahlberg), who escapes the turmoil of his home life by immersing himself in the sex and drug-fueled world of disco-dancing and hardcore pornography. Porn mogul Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds)and the sexy yet maternal Amber Waves (Julianne Moore)take Eddie under their wing, adopting him into their own twisted 'family', which Eddie is eager to join. As Eddie changes his persona to Dirk Diggler, the line between his real self and his on screen persona begins to blur, and the humbleness of his Eddie Adams is replaced by the ego-crazed arrogance of Dirk Diggler.After watching Boogie Nights time and time again, I have come to realize how truly unique it is in that the tonal shifts of the plot seem natural rather than jarring. There is a lot of humor in this movie, and at the same time a lot of sadness. Like all great filmmakers, PT Anderson is a master at playing with the audience's emotions. Boogie Nights, as well as his next film Magnolia, are emotional roller coaster rides. The key to mastering this is good characterization and seamless tonal shifts, both of which Boogie Nights succeeds in getting right.Tone is hard to define, but it can make or break a film. If a comedy is too serious, then it doesn't work. If a drama isn't taking itself seriously enough, then it doesn't work. Boogie Nights somehow manages to find that balance throughout its many tonal shifts, and for that it is a unique film watching experience.Perhaps the biggest strength in PT Anderson's films is his attention to detail in regards to his characters. In this ensemble cast, almost all of the characters undergo an emotional journeys of some sort. The fact that even the most ancillary characters have a storyline makes the film seem more realistic, and this makes it easier for the audience to sympathize with their struggles.The acting in the film is mostly superb, although truthfully I found a few scenes a bit too melodramatic. Mark Wahlberg did a good job, but in some scenes I feel he has a tendency to overact. However this is a minor gripe, and in the overall scheme he does a fantastic job revealing the emotional nuances of his character. John C. Reilly plays my favorite character in the film, Reed Rothschild, Dirk Diggler's best friend and eternal man-child.Julianne Moore gives a highly emotional and affecting performance, and Burt Reynolds is, for once, not completely annoying.On the contrary, he gives another fantastic performance. Heather Graham is great eye candy for the film, but her character has a lot more depth than her 'rollergirl' persona might suggest. In some ways I find her storyline more interesting than Dirk's.As someone who is a big fan of the music, films, and culture of the late 70's and early 80's, the setting of Boogie Nights appeals to me a great deal. The soundtrack is phenomenal, and the film uses it in some very unique ways. For example, who could forget Dirk's rendition of 'The Touch'? If you haven't seen the film yet, its worth watching for that scene alone! The film seems to have an appreciation for the time period, but also uses the changes of the period to represent changes in the characters, such as when the primary medium of porn changed from film to tape. This is masterfully done and a unique way to tell the story.Boogie Nights is a finely crafted and emotionally engaging film that engrosses you not only in its story, but in its characters and setting as well. Its one of those films you can watch time and time again and never get tired because there is simply so much to appreciate. The only things holding it back from masterpiece status are some stilted performances, but for the most part it is a great achievement.",

In 1977, when the story starts, porno movies are shot on film and play in theaters, and a director can dream of making one so good that the audience members would want to stay in the theater even after they had achieved what they came for. By 1983, when the story closes, pornos have shifted to video and most of the movies are basically just loops. I think many people pass up \"Boogie Nights\" cause they are anti-porn, or just flat out hate the adult industry and can't overlook that aspect of this film. But underneath that is a great story about characters losing everything and battle to regain themselves. This is a beautiful film... and it's too bad that enough people can't see that.",

Anderson's direction is filled with flare and lust, reminiscent of Scorsese (the frenetic cutting, the abrupt close-ups) and Brian De Palma (those steadycam shots), depicting with an exquisite detail the sensitive era when home movies turned to video, and coke was the big thing.

            "content": "PT Anderson's docu-satire on the hardcore porn industry of the late 70's and its collapse over the conservative 80's is a bold and daring tale. It also establishes him as one of the greatest young directors around at the moment. Anderson creates a unique style in the visual aspect of the film. It maintains the look and feel of a low-budget porn movie, but also the un-graded look of a documentary and the over-lapping, interweaving narrative of a satire. Indeed, he really should pay his dues to Robert Altman as he creates a similar effect. `Boogie Nights' certainly isn't for the easily provoked. There's an awareness of explicit sex as well as an aberrant sexual content, throughout. It's actually surprising that the film didn't receive an X rating (i.e. the kiss of death) from the MPAA.But one thing that `Boogie Nights' may have missed out on- perhaps intentionally- was heart. All of the characters have such high degrees of bad attitudes, it's hard to really sympathise with them or understand what they're going through. The movie follows an unusual pattern. While it is ultimately compelling, it lacks the overall dramatic shape and comprehensiveness of what it sets out to be. It also may have benefited from a better- that is more audible- soundtrack.Much like the style of Altman, the movie creates large visual sweeps as it takes in a variety of events and talks. The sound emphasises on the key elements. The editing is done very seldom in each scene as the camera follows around the characters for long periods of time, adding to the authenticity of it all. These techniques are very impressive and appreciative, but with so many characters on screen at once and the rapid-rate plot, the supporting characters rarely develop. As soon as the camera settles on one character, it quickly moves on to the next, providing us with no new information or background. And in classic Altman sense, sub-plots are briefly glanced upon but rarely explored. All characters are taken at face value.Having said that, there are tremendous performances all round from a cast made up almost entirely of Anderson's best friends in showbiz. Mark Wahlberg is a suitable lead while Burt Reynolds' turn as porn director Jack Horner is probably his best performance to date, though he takes the back seat for most of the movie. Julianne Moore's Amber Waves is an excellent creation and she perfectly balances sex-goddess with vulnerable single mother. Other supporting parts, no matter how small, are all fine but the real stand-out is John C. Reilly. It's strange how someone can go from saintly nobody (`Chicago', `Magnolia') to egotistical, tyrannical porn-star so easily.Other technical credits are top-notch all round. The art direction and cinematography are so synthetic to the last detail; it's easy to forget that the film was made in 1997. Of course there have been many complaints about the shocking amount of violence towards the end. While they may have gotten a little carried away with themselves, I prefer to think of them as punctuation marks stressing how important the given scene, and the collapse of the porn industry is.In my humble opinion, `Magnolia' is the better film as it went into a little more depth with the characters (virtually played by the exact same actors) but `Boogie Nights' is a glistening, gritty and colossal satire on the change of attitudes as the 70's ended and the 80's began. My IMDb rating: 8.0/10.",

One of the most star studded movies you will ever come across except that most of them were not stars yet.Eddie Adams (Mark Wahlberg) has an exceptional natural gift which is spotted by Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds) who grooms him, gives him an opportunity to show the world of his gift and also help him achieve his dream. Can Eddie control his ego that came along with his newly successful life, is Horner just a man who exploited his talent or something more? Answering these questions form the rest of the story.Now let me rephrase my synopsis as it sounded more like a parallel story of Rambo 3. Horner is an adult film maker who spots Eddie with a large penis and an ability to go all day long. Their synergy builds a successful run for both along with the entire unit who treat each other like family. One fine day Eddie's ego gets the better of him and the entire unit crumbles with it. Their road to darkness and resurfacing to light forms the rest of the story.I hated Paul Thomas Anderson when I watched Magnolia. Though it had a moving story and filled with excellent performances, it was flat out depressing. I feared a similar approach in this movie too not minding the energetic title. There were quite a few movies that follows the exact same storyline, most of them has either dealt with musicians or athletes but none with porn stars which stands out here. It has its moments of being awkward, cheeky, innocent and informative. It has a number of lengthy purposeful cameos by talented actors, researched portrayal of how the business of adult film industry is run, an excellent background score especially when Eddie, Horner, Rollergirl (Heather Graham) and Buck (Don Cheadle) hit rock bottom. Unlike most of his other movies, Anderson managed to life the spirits at the end of the movie though he takes you through hell just before it.Though it goes through a familiar plot line, you haven't seen anything like this before.",

Anderson captures that atmosphere very well here by juxtaposing the shallow music of the era with the depraved actions of many of its lonley occupants.  The result is a compelling story told within a lurid cheapness.  All the actors are great, and the donut shop scene is absurdly entertaining.",

            "content": "Boogie Nights is a great movie, and gives a sugar coated insight into the late 70s subculture of the Californian porn industry, before vds became deadly and when porn was shot on film. This is very much a picture of a world after the sexual revolution of the late 60s, inhabited people who are all slightly eccentric, to varying degrees. There is Roller Girl (Heather Graham), who literally goes through life (and school) on roller skates, there is Eddy Adams/Dirk Diggler (Marc Wahlberg, who's character seems like a combination of John Holmes and Jeffrey Stryker) and who has \"one special talent\" (his humongous dong) and is obsessed with Bruce Lee (who isn't/wasn't), Maggie/Amber Waves (Julianne Moore) and Buck Swope (Don Cheadle, based roughly on the famous porn actor Johnny Keyes, from among many other films, \"Behind The Green Door\", and/or Jack Baker).I especially like Don Cheadle's character (a great actor), who in an epitome of the way all the characters don't fit in with society, is an almost perfect stereo salesman, who falls down because of insisting on playing the customers _HIS_ (rather than their) favorite music, Country & Western. Buck Swope is continually one style behind, insisting that \"country will make a comeback\" throughout the seventies, and at new year's eve party 1979/1980 being decked out in an afrocentric/outer space outfit that makes him look like one of the members of Earth, Wind & Fire. He finally finds his style, though, in early eighties Hip-Hop.Rather than being simply a showcase of seventies culture, all of the characters are amalgams of several porn characters, and many of the situations are similar to actual events.For instance, the drug situation at the end of the movie is similar to what happened to John Holmes (he was interviewed by homicide detectives - see the movie \"Wonderland\" with Val Kilmer). John Holmes, though, in the end died if AIDS, caught in a gay video shoot, rather than just being beaten up by a gang of homophobes (without ill effects).Which is where the sugar coating comes in. In this movie, most of the characters in the end find their places in society, whereas in real life, several ended up dead. Another example, in this movie, the drug of choice seems to be cocaine, but in reality, it was heroine, probably so we don't have scenes of people shooting up. So, you have the situation of several characters overdosing on coke, which is a rare event, whereas od'ing on heroine is quite common. Also, no one ever catches any std.Anyway, the structure of the movie is almost very similar to Oliver Stone's Vietnam movies - the viewer is swept along with the progress of history and time, rather than depending on intricate plotting. The characters do develop, though, but predictably.Either way, this is a unique movie. Go and see it if you haven't already.",

The other star is taken off, because, for all of its grit, the movie was a happy one, with a happy ending. That's not how it usually goes in life.

This is a mystery, in light of an excellent director, an excellent cast, and excellent camerawork.  In fact, nearly everything about this movie is perfect, EXCEPT the script.  To put it nicely, the script just plain stinks. While I can see that the film is supposed to make some sort of point about loneliness and interpersonal relationships, the story is completely jumbled and just doesn't make very much sense.  Characters never really develop as well as they should and are not very interesting.I'm not really sure why anyone does anything in this movie; motivations are never an issue.  Although the film certainly succeeds in evoking certain moods, I was never sure why I felt the way I did about a particular scene and ended up getting annoyed.  Finally, the ending, which could have saved the entire film, kind of petered out and left me feeling disappointed.\nI can see why this film made money.  It contains excessive drugs, sex, and pornography.  It's not that these ruin the film for me; it's just that the film never really gets beyond these into any meaningful story. \nIn summary, this is a nice technical film.  However, _Magnolia_ is superior in every way (incidentally, not only to this film, but to many others as well.)",

Everyone of the characters, who all work in the blue movie biz, end up in the gutter. No-one seems to make a fortune, earn respect, or even have fun. No, they are all junkies, coke-heads, losers, and even dumb. The only world they can make it in is their sinful trade. What a hypocritical way to look at things. I assure you there are plenty of careers in Hollywood based on some involvement in the adult film market. This film tries to get the reputation of a \"daring and groundbreaking film\". Nonsense! Is it daring? Nope. Just take the scene in which Julianne Moore and Mark Wahlberg are filmed on 16mm. We can see the footage they shoot. It's supposed to be a hardcore flick, right? So why does the director only shoot from the waist up? Repressed. And this infamous shot of Wahlbergs Willy - it only shocked the uptight American critics. There was no need to show it that late in the film. It just wanted to gain attention in a cheap way at the end of a very long film. It is a shameful film, in more than one way.

Let me make this clearer: the plot is interesting, but the story line is too light. This is not necessarily a bad thing. Sometimes, movies turn out better when they are more \"light weight\". Due to the volatile natures of the characters, this lightness fitted in quite well. It's almost perfect. A certain heaviness of the story is embedded into this lightness with a very \"merry\" soundtrack following it around throughout the entire movie. However, it was not embedded enough. I mentioned the soundtrack. Before I comment on that, I must say that I think that soundtracks are VERY IMPORTANT in a movie. If the soundtrack does not fit into the movie, it is very possible that I will dislike the entire thing, even though the movie itself without the music might be good enough. The OST of this movie is: TERRIFIC. The music goes along with the characters and especially the story, but in some instances: the music was too happy, when it should have been more solemn.It would be a shame not to watch this movie.

            "content": "Since having seen this film and in a previous review where I thought it \"realistic,\" I have made a study of the adult film industry. As a result, I have found that this highly regarded and most entertaining film conveys some misconceptions about that industry. Firstly, if you look at the films in that period (the late seventies), you'll find that much of the acting is quite good and the production values were quite high (it was not unusual for a porno film to be budgeted at $200,000).  Sex scenes and nonsex dialogue or plot scenes ran about 50/50, unlike todays films which are almost all sex and have very few accomplished actors in them. Often foreign locales such as London were used as settings (see Marylin Chambers in \"Insatiable,\" for example)., and the sets could be quite elaborate.  \"Boogie Nights\" suggests that only the cheapest of sets were used and the performers were a pack of semi retarded dolts, and that was just not true.Secondly, for the most part the performers did not congregate in well-knit groups, although some of that was done.  Most went their separate lives after a scene or a film was shot.  Some just went home to the wife or husband and the kids.  Christine Fugat, in her recent documentary \"The Girl Next Door,\" tells of how much she was impressed by how \"normal\" these people seemed to her.Next, generally the women were not  dumb and forced  to work for menial wages; many of them were quite intelligent and just chose to work in that industry and aspired (unsuccessfully for the most part) to get into mainstream films, mainly for the money.  Today, it is taken for granted that women rule that industry often setting the conditions under which they will work, the things they will and will not do, etc.Probably the most accurate depiction in the film was the debilitating effects video tape had on the quality of the films produced. There was a period in the 70's were \"porno chic\" was prominent.  Even Roger Ebert gave a favorable review to \"The Devil and Miss Jones,\" as I recall.  People, often prominent ones, would wait in line to see such productions as\"Deep Throat\" and \"Behind the Green Door.\"  Marylin Chambers was treated as a true star and stayed at the best hotels and appeared at grand openings, searchlights and all.Next, although cocaine use was widespread, that tended to be true of many professions in that era, including mainstream. Hollywood. The adult film industry was not a glaring exception.If the director \"researched\" the porn film industry, as he claims, I would suggest that he did a poor and one sided job of it. I still say his commentary track is one of the worst I have heard on a DVD.",

Most of the characters were wholly likable but far too shallow to really care about - worrying about superficial values, appearances or how many lines of coke they can snort at a time.Initially I was wary of the impact of Boogie Nights, expecting a sordid, dark, sinister type of experience, instead of a frivolous tale with tongue-in-cheek humour throughout. I new I was going to like it right from the start, with it's star-studded cast, excellent soundtrack and visual style, but it started to lose steam after an hour because of the non-discernible plot progression and novelty level that had worn off.The film has lots of swearing, epic amounts of cocaine abuse but not that much nudity or pornography, surprisingly. It's also graphically violent in places, but didn't shock or affect me in the way I expected. In fact, Boogie Nights is a film about gullible, often charming, not very sensible people that ultimately lose their way in life, later trying to redeem themselves, accepting that they're ultimately pretty f**ked up as a whole.But somehow it didn't gel together well enough, emotionally, by the end.Definitely worth a watch, but not as shocking or ground-breaking as you might think.",

A solemn little piece of music placed right into the 70's adult industry is in front, just to get cut off with a solid funk act... known and placed in the 70's. Really nice!There is a sense of a theme park during this film as it begins and stops with a typical theme taken from the late 70's and the early 80's adult industry. A little charming and careful tune as from a barrel organ that sets the entire tone for the movie. There is things going on all the time during the around 160 minutes of movie... something around every corner.Is this sarcasm to the adult industry? Is it a show off in how the stars and crew behind the scenes acted and acts? It can be both. It 's all in the eye of the beholder.The naive and total lack off integrity in the adult business is shown off in a huge comic sense during the whole motion picture.

Burt Reynolds and Mark Wahlberg is excellent together and touches that \"fake innocence\" that the adult industry tries so hard to develop and force upon the viewers.Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Good work and well performed production. \"Best written screenplay written directly for the Screen\", Academy Award nominee. Amazing excellence in the costumes and the surroundings during the era of 70's and 80's. - The actors : Julianne Moore and Burt Reynolds nominated for Academy Awards. Burt Reynolds won a Golden Globe for his performance. - The story : As it is almost 20 years ago since the movie settled, it was and is an important movie. Before the global phenomenon of the internet \"amateur adult\" industry came into the light. About this time, there were documentaries about the adult industry and business getting television time globally. Yes, an important movie and I would say the time was right. Maybe there could be a Boogie Nights 2 now with the same actors to shed light on today's industry in the same business. - Entertainment : Tragic, sad, little laughs here and there.

If you like the 70's and 80's you should see it to know about the reality that they lived during those years. Paul Anderson was great, he really knows how to make good films that entertain a lot. This is an interesting movie in which you could see the way some people during 70's and 80's were. Things were very bad during those years and what about this year?? I think we still have problems like drugs, sex, money, etc. This movie shows it and more. Watch it and find out some more about the 70's and the beginning of 80's. On the other hand Julianne Moore was incredible, she is really a great actress, she got a nomination for best actress. This movie won a lot of awards because of its plot, camera work and the way they show how bad life is. It's worth watching only to know what's bad and good. 7/10",

The film is beautifully illustrated by the grooviness of the '70s with a classic song constantly playing in the background or unique camera movements to immerse the audience into the drug-infused trip the characters go through. The film has a premise that feels original and emotional, tacking the adult pocket of cinema when it was at its peak of popularity, transitioning to the aftermath of its slow decline. This is brilliantly inhabited by characters that are written with such emotion and humanity, accompanied by performances that breathe life into the characters, giving them genuine character and personality. The directing in the film is also noteworthy, bringing an earlier version of Anderson's style to the masterful filmmaking that will come later in his career. However, despite the many positives this film has, it is not entirely perfect. The film at times feels a little all over the place, focusing on characters that don't really have a purpose to the overall story. The film also goes on a little longer than it ultimately should. Although it may have minor flaws, Boogie Nights is a groovy experience filled with a brilliant character study, an amazing story, and immaculate directing that will shock and awe the audience with every viewing.",

What if this person has a burning desire to be in the movie business and it is the the 70's before independent film took off? One answer, porno movies.\nBoogie Nights gives a glimpse into the world of skin flicks in their hey day in the San Fernando Valley. Writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson is masterful in capturing the energy of this time with disco scenes, parties with the right clothes and music. But better than this are the quirky characters. They believe that they are terrific actors, artists and musicians. What they will not admit is that they make poorly made porno films. The pain of life is too strong for them but it can only be held off for so long. Time and again the facts come crashing in finally leading to an ending which feels like a bad hang over. Paul Thomas Anderson's style is impressive. It sometimes looks like Scorsese with the long tracking shots and a great Raging Bull dressing room scene. There is a little bit of Tarantino also. But better than this is how well the actors perform under Anderson's direction. This is Burt Reynolds' best work since Deliverance. Julianne Moore, Heather Graham, Don Cheadle are great portraying people who have turned their back on much of the world, trying to create their own. These characters grow on you after a while. They are there for each other including taking in Mark Wahlberg's Dirk Digler who is the most convinced of his \"greatness\". I can't help but think of Ed Wood when I see this film. He also brought together a group of misfits that struggled to create movies. When the B movie business died, he went on to make porno films which was the only place where a person with his \"talent\" could go.Boogie Nights wrestles with the question about how people express themselves. And more than that, it is about dealing with life. It does it with rare humor, style and heart and how often can you say that about a movie?",

As a 70s child, I have a deep acceptance that the rules were not that defined and there's this transition from the flower power to the hippie era where the borders of sex are oftentimes too open and too easy to abuse.

I'll narrow it down to four.1) It de-glorified pornography. It wasn't glamorized rather interpreted as a character study of the individuals involved.2) It was real. The dialogue matched its characters. These people I could have known personally as my next door neighbor or a regular at the grocery store. They had feelings and they all enjoyed and suffered the benefits as well as the liabilities they allowed in this type of work. We as the audience got to witness this.3) I am a big fan of dark humor.

            "content": "Paul Thomas Anderson brings to life the porn industry, during its most triumphant moments.  Set in the late seventies and early eighties, Boogie Nights is the story of Jack Horner, a director of adult films who, with his cast of characters, dreams of creating the first legitimate porn film. \nHorner's cast of players each brings to the story their own unique baggage, suggesting that their past is what brought them into the sex trade.  Juliane Moore is a coke addicted mother who mourns for a child that was taken from her.  Heather Graham is a roller skating teen who could never fit in with kids her own age.  And Thomas Jane is Todd Parker, in his own mind the studio stud.And of course, the crew have their own dramas.  William H. Macey is the lighting director who can't control his sex starved wife.  Phillip Seymour Hoffman is the sound guy, a social misfit who hides his lustful thoughts. And Robert Ridgley is Colonel Parker, the financier for all of Jack Horner's films, who is just as much a victim in the vile world that he creates, as he is a villain.And naturally, while the porn industry becomes a haven for all of these tragic figures, it eventually becomes their downfall.  Their lives are first impacted by the discovery of Dirk Diggler.  Dirk, played by Mark Wahlburg, is a keen, but troubled kid, blessed with an extra special endowment.  It's this endowment that makes him an instant hit in the porn industry, taking him right to the top, eventually setting him up for the biggest downfall of all.Anderson directs a brilliant picture, ironically creating the kind of film that his character Jack Horner could only dream of; a pornographic film with top notch acting and a compelling story line.  While Boogie Nights never delivers the money shot, there are graphic sexual depictions that suggest that this one was made for (not just about) the porn industry.  Scenes with characters having casual sex, taking obscene amounts of drugs and basically throwing their dignity away serve to make this one of the most shocking films of the decade.   Burt Reynolds stands out in an Oscar nominated performance, playing a pervert with a heart of gold.  While Reynolds sometimes gets caught up in his own mannerisms he does manage to  pull it off.  I suspect that this part tailor made itself for Burt, more so than Burt for the part.  In fact it has become Hollywood folklore, and perhaps proof that Reynolds is himself trapped in the seventies, the fact that he fired his agent when he saw the finished product.  It's funny he couldn't even see that this was his best work in an otherwise dopey career.Mark Wahlburg is good as Dirk Diggler.  Again, Anderson makes a natural casting choice.  The performances that truly stand out in my mind were those of Juliane Moore and Phillip Seymour Hoffman.  As Amber, den mother to the cast, Moore is dead on.  I found her most brilliant work to be when her character is actually required to act.  Anyone who has ever seen a pornographic film will recognize this card board performance and probably laugh out loud.  Hoffman, on the other hand, lusting after Dirk, is wonderfully pathetic.  In a sea of low life characters, here is the one we least want to be.The direction in this film is often overwhelming, and for me that is a good thing.  Anderson uses the camera to his advantage, sometimes allowing it to float through the crowd at various parties, and at other times providing quick flashes of truth.Boogie Nights does not condemn the porn industry, nor does it praise it.  At the time when sex films were transferred from 8 millimeter film and onto video tape, they somehow became legitimate.  This film simply documents that time.",

Julianne Moore gives an Oscar nominated performance as Amber Waves- a rising porn star, trying to battle motherhood, while making a living in the adult film industry- powerfully portrayed and impressively handled, Moore should have received the award. Burt Reynolds also gives an Oscar nominated performance- however though this performance didn't have any Oscar potential, it did have wit and personality. Heather Graham gives a stunning performance as Roller Girl which deserved at least a Golden Globe nomination. This movie showed what it is like to be in the adult film industry. The beginning of the movie, outlined the nightlife, and the joys of being in the Adult film industry, but as the movie goes on, the joys end and the problems begin. PT Anderson's direction, would make you feel for each character. An AMAZING job and n AMAZING movie.",

It was very well-written, well-filmed, and a sad, dark portrayal of how the world can be as a place. Although this film is undeniably for mature audiences, it is the sort of film that has enough meaning built into the shock to really justify the shocking nature of it. Not to mention that, but it is the sort of film that satisfies the curiosity into the world in which Dirk lived. Throughout the whole film the acting is exceptionally well, being such an easy film to get sucked into. I think that the wide appeal for the film comes from its' thoroughness in character portrayal as well as the depth that each character has when it is cultivated in such a short amount of time; each person who appears in the film is more than just an image on the screen, but with the passage of time, you really see them as actual people. It is a movie that, while watching it, you simply forget it is a movie due to the perfection that Paul Thomas Anderson achieves in his realistic, no-holds barred film. I especially enjoy how Dirk Diggler is portrayed with his beaming innocence and simple mind: it makes one see nothing sinister about him, but it lends to the viewer an air of a certain objectivity and lack of judgmental sentiment as they watch the entirety of the porn world unfold around this character.Overall, I recommend this film to everyone who can appreciate good film and has the stomach for sometimes rather edgy and racy material.",

            "content": "Starting against a black screen with fade in credits, Michael Penn scores broken circus music that whistles triumph and failure of the grandest scale. The warped tones and drowned out laughter provides a foreshadowing of the gradual downfall of a man we all see ourselves in. This score leads into the epic one-shot opening of Boogie Nights, set to Best of My Love, which shoots us into the glamorous world of the social circle we will eventually join.Paul Thomas Anderson makes his mark by direction in every front. Sporting Mark Wahlberg, Julianne Moore, John C. Reilly, Phillip Seymour Hoffman as an incredible ensemble as is, PTA directs these actors to preform their roles as simple-minded humans who are just trying to find self-assurance of their own worth in a complex world. All characters seem to have a heart of gold, but lead themselves into disaster by no fault but their own human mistakes. PTA refuses to let us find their job as machines in the porn industry as an excuse to pass them as lesser human, as he sets them in scenes with one another that establish their puppy-dog-like loyalty to one another in hope to feel and be loved, to feel a sense of belonging, to find a home which can celebrate them for their own achievements and be proud in one another alongside themselves.Beyond the raw emotive scenes of ones darkened past and fuzzy future, we are drawn in by all stylistic choices that make this epic feel incredibly intimate. PTA directs cinematographer Robert Elswit to capture the story a very distinct way. Seeing influences such as Marty Scorsese in his quick zooms, stylistic incoming vignettes, heavy steady cam and dolly shots between drawn out nearly theatrical drawn out scenes with complex blocking, challenge traditional film making standards of quality, in that it draws sever attention to the audience of the film being in fact, a film, and fictional. However, his direction to his cast and writing which previously mentioned, is impeccably human, seems to cancel this heavily orchestrated style to challenge the viewer to choose what is in fact real or unreal, to suspend disbelief and yet honor the film as a film in a rather superficial and frankly dumbed-down manner that puts us in the same position as the characters.In addition to all external direction PTA approached for this movie, we see heavily influence and reflection from PTA himself. Besides being set in the 70s in San Fernando Valley around the protagonist as a 17 year old, we have several other moments and key features that we see PTA projecting from himself. Early on we have a glimpse into the life of Eddie Edams (Wahlberg) in his dysfunctional relationship wit his mother through a heated, raw exchange that ends in his estrangement. In commentary of this film, PTA shares this is merely a glimpse into a real-life exchange between his mother and himself. He has admitted on other occasions to being estranged from his mother. As we as an audience question the reasoning to the anger, accusatory sense, and aggression the mother has for her son, PTA is there with us, questioning the motives of his own mother, of questions he himself could not answer.The real word that emerges to describe this movie is \"momentum\". From literal camera styles of quick pace pull ins, to a blossoming storyline that illuminates us with the wonders and woes of ambiguous characters who we don't think to question their origin but accept their presence in the most intimate nature, this movie has an unexpected \"edge-of-your-seat\" nature that keeps your heart in an emotional roller-coaster. In the end, we are left to feel a sense of home as we learn, with the characters, that it shall be wherever you strive to make it.",

One of the scenes that put the icing on the cake is with Don Cheadle in the donut shop. The whole thing seemed to have this Hollywood fakeness that, in my experience, is unparalleled.

            "content": "Paul Thomas Anderson's Boogie Nights is a bold and accurate representation of the adult film scene in Los Angeles during the late 70's and early 80's. While it primarily chronicles one man's rise and fall within the industry and is base on the expolits of real-life porn star John Holmes, the story is so much more, juxtaposing the similar fates of several principal characters during a six year time period. Anderson's fascinating and brutally honest character studies allows the viewer to overcome reservations toward watching a movie about pornography. The result is a truly outstanding film on every level.Seventeen year old Eddie Adams (Mark Wahlberg) has a chance meeting in a nightclub with porn film maker Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds). Disenchanted with his life and spurred by a violent argument with his abusive and alcoholic mother, Adams moves into Horner's home and joins his stable of adult film actors which include veteran porn queen Maggie/a.k.a. Amber Waves (Julianne Moore) Horner's daughter and aspiring starlet Rollergirl (Heather Graham) and fellow actor Reed Rothschild (John C. Reilly). As a well-endowed new face in the industry, he achieves quick stardom. However, Adams (now \"Dirk Diggler\"), eventually falls victim to the temptations of fame and becomes addicted to cocaine. As newer actors emerge and the medium changes from film to videotape, he becomes a bitter, drug-addled liability. After a heated confrontation with Horner, Diggler gets kicked off the compound and spirals out of control. Unable to \"perform\" due to his drug use, he is reduced to turning tricks to support his habit. After a brush with death during a botched robbery of local drug dealer Rahad Jackson (Alfred Molina), Diggler tearfully reconciles with Horner and cleans up his act but clearly faces an uphill battle in reaching the heights he once climbed within the industry.Anderson clearly shows us the devastating consequences many of these \"actors\" suffer as a result of their career choice without beating us over the head with a morality play. This is a sad story about sad people: Diggler bottoms out. Jack Horner, who fancies himself a film maker is reduced to churning out low-quality garbage on video. Amber's career choice and prior drug arrest force her into role playing instead of true motherhood, as she unsuccessfully seeks custody of her child. Porn star Buck (Don Cheadle) cannot secure a business loan due to his affiliation with adult films. A film director (William H. Macy), humiliated by his wife's public infidelities, kills her, her lover and himself at a New Year's Eve party. And Financier The Colonel James (Robert Ridgely), who fronts the money for Horner's productions is jailed on a child pornography charge. What was once hedonistic bliss is now an unmitigated disaster. There is no happy ending.The styles, fashion and music create a mood that successfully transforms the viewer into a 1970's time warp. And excellent characterization of the drug dependent and open-sex lifestyle popularized by many in the entertainment industry lend the movie authenticity. There are so many subtleties and great scenes- the (purposely) bad performances in the \"Brock Landers\" feature films, the cheesy interviews, the awful recording sessions by Diggler and Rothschild, the delusions and self-deceptions by the many characters who are not very smart, totally insecure, largely uneducated yet fancy themselves as much more than they really are.The acting is first rate. Burt Reynolds, whose career stagnated for years after a decade of box office stardom in the 70's, returns to greatness as film producer Jack Horner. Mark Wahlberg, under-appreciated by many who remember the \"Marky Mark\" nonsense is totally believable in the title role. Julianne Moore, as good an actress as there is, doesn't disappoint as a popular yet tormented porn queen. John C. Reilly, the late Philip Seymour Hoffman (as a shy, gay crew member), Heather Graham and the wonderful Phillip Baker Hall all shine in support roles. And Robert Ridgely does a great job in a bit role as The Colonel- a film producer with an affinity for young women and a perversion for underage photos.One of the best movies of the 1990's and in my personal top ten films.",

Burt Reynolds plays a slightly pathetic porno-director at the end of the grainy, earthy sex-on-celluloid era which is about to be overtaken by the videotaped, sanitized, twinky zone of the '80s... Other actors are notable, including Heather Graham, Don Cheadle, Julianne Moore, etc. Oh, and how could one forget Philip Seymour Hoffman and his quivering boom-mike?? But Mark Wahlberg's casting makes the thing work, not simply because of his build (a lot of buff actors exist out there) but his demeanor--- his relaxed, lost, slightly forlorn, semi-arrogantly knuckle-headed vulnerability... he absolutely SCREAMS late-'70s teenager. (I'm not sure if Mr. Wahlberg has ever understood how \"right\" he got it with his performance).The movie, naturally, is a bit of a parody of the time, yet within that spirit of parody, gets the disco era much, much more right than it does wrong. Period zeitgeist is always made up of more than just mere physicality, and BOOGIE NIGHTS, through whatever method, manages to convince you that 1977 is actually 1977.And that's no small praise.There are some elements the film probably misses. When one recalls the late-'70s --- especially as it might relate to the sex/porn industry --- it's might be easy to ignore or forget its aspect of superlative sleaze; it was the time of early-Sex Pistols (before \"real\" punk got cleaned up in the '80s), CALIGULA, CRUISING, Studio 54 (no, not that terribly watered-down film with Ryan Phillippe years later) when a certain sexuality of degradation seemed to reach its apotheosis... If you side-step or miss that \"sick\" note of that time, you've almost missed the time... Admittedly, BOOGIE NIGHTS, deliberately or not, doesn't \"get\" that element; it's all a bit too giddy and innocent to do so (although that rings true, too).And yet I'm kind of glad it didn't go into that gutter; otherwise, the film would have likely slid into something else too unseemly, and the things it got right might have run the risk of being negated or overshadowed.A good, delightfully silly picture.

Just like Paul Thomas Anderson's other well known movie Magnolia, he proves once again with this film that his work has a very unique, trademark feel to it - all the more impressive when there are definite nods to the films of Scorcese for example. PTAs films are full of human life - just like Magnolia, here he creates a spectrum of characters who are all likable and real, and the strength of their creation is what sees pretty much faultless performances from the entire ensemble cast. But he is not afraid to show us the highs and lows of each character, and this is what engages the audience. Mark Wahlberg is very good as Dirk Diggler, and Julieanne Moore exceptional as the maternal figure fascinated by him. But Burt Reynolds as the unofficial father figure of the cast was both a delight and a surprise, and John C. Reilly also sizzled in every scene. There is some obvious symbolism - when Wahlberg and friends travel to Alfred Molina's apartment to rip him off in a drug deal, his padlocked gates close behind them as they enter his house - clearly a reference to the gates of hell. And the overwhelming impression of the concluding scenes, when Reynolds wanders around his vast porn-funded house checking in on all the hangers on and cast members he has assembled over the years - but with a warm sense of fatherly love - was very poignant and clever. It's impossible not to like the cast - and although there are some very shocking scenes that lack huge subtlety, this is film making at its best and deserves a lot of recognition.",

It's not bad but it doesn't really move you, it seems like a rather shallow shot at what they wanted to do.  The sex scenes seem actually rather amateur like in actual B porno movies, maybe it was meant to imitate them.  It's better than Showgirls overall, but the sex is worse. Of course we don't get to see the star's 13 inch wonder until the very end, and my wife has 2 bucks that says it was rubber.  (Hey, how would she know?) -Bob",

To be honest there's not a bad performance from any of the actors in his movie,. Those i found most noteworthy besides Wahlberg were John.C.Reilly and Don Cheadle who really excelled in their roles. Also the cameo from Alfred Molina as the Russian roullette playing drug dealer is simply class. This movie depicts the pitfalls of showbusiness in the 70's and 80's wonderfully and although its quite long it never lags and in my opinion is an instant classic.",

Boogie Nights is a bold and sprawling story about stardom, family, and the porn industry. Anderson shows the late 1970's as a fun ride that the characters enjoy, and the 1980's as the fun that fades away while things go downhill for everyone. I'm not a huge fan of Mark Wahlberg but he really impressed me with his role as Dirk Diggler. Burt Reynolds and Julianne Moore are also incredible as their characters feel like true parents to Dirk. The soundtrack is pretty lit as well. Overall, Boogie Nights is funny, tragic, and suspenseful.",

            "content": "Pornography has always been a delicate subject to tackle, and with the bold approach of Paul Thomas Anderson, it becomes even more surprising in its modern portrayal. Most people when they hear about pornography, they immediately regard those responsible with disdain and unapologetic hatred. Their humanity, as well as any sympathy is stripped from them by the very people judging them, as if they don't recognize their own flaws, when really that's the whole concept beyond this story. Boogie Nights is a multiple character study about a group of people, who each bare a unique quality within them, despite all the doubts and fears they hold in their struggle for survival. The film's direction is raw, and the scenes are long, as they capture the emotional aspects of each character in both their triumphant and tragic moments. It goes beyond a more conventional subject, as Anderson, both writer and director of this film illuminates these characters in a 6 year period from 1977 to 1984, initially finding a more empathetic definition for family, outside its traditional biological standards.Beginning in the year 1977, upon the discovery of a 17 year old Eddie Adams (Wahlberg), adult film director Jack Horner (Reynolds) takes the troubled high school dropout in the hopes of making more influential and meaningful pictures. Along with the gifted Bruce Lee fan, comes Roller Girl (Graham), a mellow porn starlet who never takes her skates off, during or after sex. Ginger (Moore), Horner's girlfriend immediately fills the role of surrogate mother for Eddie, seeing him as a second chance for her to be an actual mother, knowing her addictions prevent her from ever seeing her own for even one weekend.This film is really all about second chances for everyone. Early on in the film as Eddie makes love to a young woman named Cheryl (Holloman), she compliments his penis, and how he uses it so well to make love. Eddie then smiles and says, \"Everybody's born with something special.\" The optimism that Mark Wahlberg that gives off in his performance, along with his youth give his character Eddie Adams an authentic sense of idealism. In this life, we all have this desire to make the best of it, and knowing that our time is short, then do we dream of being great. We hope to succeed in our lives, with the very talent we were born with. Call it God, destiny, or the Universe, wherever these talents emerge from, we all hope to use it as a means of defining ourselves more profoundly in this temporary journey. Boogie Nights captures this idealistic ambition through its assortment of characters. Ranging from the well-endowed Eddie Adams/Dirk Diggler, the country/hip-hop artist Buck (Cheadle), the aspiring filmmaker Jack Horner, to the cocaine addicted Amber, Anderson portrays these characters sympathetically, thus taking influence from his own family's involvement in the porn industry, as well his own personal feelings towards the familial aspect that aspires towards a new definition.Aside from that many critics have often discussed the oedipal complex looming its shadow over the course of this film, and it can be clearly seen within the interactions Eddie has with both Amber his surrogate mother, and his biological mother played hatefully brilliant by Joanna Gleeson. A scene where Eddie returns home after his initiation at Jack's, he is confronted by his mother, who questions his sex life. This interrogation instantly turns into a brutal and humiliating argument as Eddie is berated to the point that he whimpers like a helpless child and desperately begs for his mother to stop. Within the comfort of Amber, comes a unique benevolent and innocent bond, and it is clearly seen within the graphic sex scenes they engage in, as the mother and son infatuation is explored against the more conventional standards of morality incestuous morality.Long, and raw to the point that with each instance of change in its documentary essence, Boogie Nights beautifully captures the end of an era, as the 70's head to the 80's, and society turns to new direction. The cultural changes of drugs, music, and clothing attire constantly shift in the world Paul Thomas Anderson has created. A bright and colorful opening introduces the audience to a variety of characters each with a unique trait, soon to be fully open that we see their ambitions, as well their weaknesses. Anderson's writing style conveys a realistic interpretation of each his characters. In both their positive and negative qualities, the camera gives enough focus, rendering their reactions as authentic and polarizing to the degree that we can't look away as they run around going crazy. Boogie Nights is inspired from Anderson's 1988 mokumentary short, The Dirk Diggler Story, which chronicles the life of a well-endowed model, Dirk Diggler. Following a similar story pattern to the short, Boogie Nights expands its story more, with its variety of characters as they experience an era that challenges their own places in the world as human beings. Its captivating in its performances, and even touching within the themes tackled, as Anderson captures a more empathetic portrayal of family, escaping the biological roots that people often cling to despite the dysfunction, and delivers a more open minded concept, without demonizing the more traditional idea of family. The surrogate family, although they are in pornography, they all have love, and that is all that is required to brave an ever changing and indifferent world.",

Again and again functionally the same thing is enacted three or four times. I guess maybe this is what happens when the same guy writes and directs a movie, and comes from a hardball position about control over final cut... especially when the guy in question has relatively little real experience. In a way it's great stuff... but it REALLY lacks focus and discipline... it's just a big, wandering, repetitive, self-indulgent sprawl. Still... it's certainly better than something without the creative juice in the first place. By all means see it... I'd recommend it to pretty much anyone (other than those easily offended by the subject matter). But don't really expect to see a finished movie... be prepared to spend a long evening watching stuff that could have made a fine movie (maybe even two fine movies). One final thing - don't be discouraged by the fact that this movie is \"about pornography\"... at least not unless you just can't stand to contemplate or discuss pornography at all - Boogie Nights really isn't mainly about porn... it's about people and time and hope and despair and all that usual awful stuff we all live through, one way or another.",

            "content": "If you are wondering what it would be like to be a porn star during the late 70's and early 80's, you should watch Boogie Nights. It may seem shallow and objectifying but the story actually goes deeper than that. Paul Thomas Anderson's film is about Eddie (Mark Wahlberg), a misfit soon to be 18 years old, who works as a dishwasher in a night club. He meets Jack (Burt Reynolds), a porn film director who can offer him a chance. Eddie leaves his messy home environment, takes the name Dirk Diggler and heads straight into a tough industry.Anderson's Boogie Nights is a dirty film and not really a glamorous story. On the surface it may seem easy and tempting considering Dirk's quick and easy way to success, but behind the curtains it's not a pretty tale. Lies, deceit, infidelity and selfishness grow beneath the surface. The story focuses and is mostly about Dirk, but also Jack and his team in the industry. Julianne Moore plays Dirk's co-star and fights for the custody of her own child. Heather Graham plays the young Rollergirl who quit high school to enter the porn industry. Each character has his or her own emotional baggage. Paul Thomas Anderson's style is visible even this early in his career and the film is made of long takes, a lot of characters and a plot sometimes not really knowing where it's going.I claim that in some way the essence of Boogie Nights lies with the characters' own approach and attitude towards the industry. It is embraced but everybody still sort of wants a way out. Someone dreams of a family and parenthood, another wants to be a magician or a salesman of stereos. Even Jack dreams of directing his masterpiece and constantly tries new ways to get there. In some way they all still gather in the industry because it is the easy way. I don't think Anderson's purpose is to smear the industry but at the same time he doesn't want to glorify it either. There is a will to portray these bleeding people in a serious and emotional way while feeling neither sorry nor praise for them. It is about the understanding of other people's life choices even if they feel wrong for others. Boogie Nights is a few years old but still stands well today as an emotional portrait of a group of people that took a different path than what society called the normal one.David Lindahl - www.filmografen.se",

But yeah, the movie is okay or a watch but the structure of it is very close to the foundations of most Hollywood films.

Also, much of the dialogue between the minor players is so shallow, it's very realistic, and curiously entertaining. The actors play it straight, as if they really were that stupid, so it comes off as genuine and not derogatory, and you develop an attachment to them just as they are. By minor players, I mean, the porn actors, because their lives were controlled by external forces, whereas the major players like Jack Horner and his financier were the ones in control.*** Spoiler Alert ***When Eddie's mom tears into him with her \"You're stupid!\" tirade, it was so well done, I wanted him to hit her, she was so mean. And it made it easy to see how he would have gone into something like porn, but it wasn't preachy about it. More like, here's what happened and what this particular guy did as a result.Same with the cocaine. It wasn't a preachy anti-drug thing, but bad things really did happen to people who overdid cocaine, and these characters were able to pull out of it and get their lives back on track.I thought the way Buck Swope found redemption was little facile, and it's pretty hard to believe that there would have been enough money in that safe to finance his business. However, isn't it interesting that whenever someone in a movie goes to a convenience store at night, bad stuff is bound to happen?Also, I didn't like the way the ending was so happy. Nobody had to pay for their sins, which were pretty egregious for some. Like Rollergirl smashing a guy's skull with her skates, and then not much later being admonished to clean her room by Daddy Horner. And what about Buck taking the money and not getting caught? Excuse me, but I seem to recall surveillance cameras even in the \"distant\" past of the 1980's.The ending brought humanity to the whole story, with so many broken, damaged people finding a kind of salvation and love, however twisted, under Horner's wing, but I think it would have been better with a little more anguish. That would have made it a masterpiece, if the remaining characters had been able to find love and redemption and some kind of inner peace in the face of imponderable sadness.But then, the final scene was Eddie Adams looking at his huge member in the mirror to give himself a pep talk, so I guess something like the depth of emotion of the end of The Deer Hunter would have been inappropriate.",

            "content": "Having grown up on watching movies and having no reason for making them other than to ape his idols, Anderson lifts the template from Scorsese's Goodfellas in this adolescent ripoff. Tell me - Which film am I describing here? Narrative structure: Set primarily over the course of the mid-1970s through the 80s, a young high-schooler has troubles at home and has to live with abusive family members. He feels trapped in this environment, and to help him escape, he grows attached to a surrogate family whose activities revolve around moral and societal vice. He finds that he excels in this environment and rises quickly in this new family hierarchy, earning both respect and riches from it. He eventually becomes fully initiated into this new family when he passes a test that demonstrates his commitment and talent to the vices that they support, and he is then rewarded by this new family with a celebration. At near mid-point, a \"retro reel\" involving 8mm or 16mm home movies and photos are used in a montage to express the passage of time and the deepening relationship between our protagonist and the other members of his new family. Things are going swimmingly until, at what is supposed to be a fun social occasion among friends, violence unexpectedly breaks out, resulting in murder and death. This scene mid-way through the plot tells the viewer that not all is well within this \"fun\" social structure, and that its very mores helped to contribute to the mindset that would lead someone to murder. But our protagonist tries to brush aside this violent event as a mere aberration, not wanting to question social world he has embraced. After eventually reaching a pinnacle of success, cultural shifts along with an infusion of drug abuse drag our protagonist down to the point where the same elements stemming from the vice and the surrogate family he joined now work against him until he hits rock bottom. When he hits rock bottom, he has a falling out with his surrogate \"father figure\" who turns against him for his betrayals and now uncontrollable drug use. All of this nearly kills him - but he still manages to survive rock bottom (unlike some of his friends around him). He is eventually able to pull himself up from rock bottom and settle into a less-than-ideal but by no means awful life, wistfully thinking back on the good times and how they are likely gone forever. Stylistic elements: Wall-to-wall music to help set tone, establish the time setting and occasionally provide an additional commentary on the action itself. Swish-pans, rapid editing sequences to convey frenetic energy, punctuated by extensive dolly and tracking shots to convey more leisurely times of our characters and cover the spaces of the lively nightclubs that they frequent. Title cards placed late in the film in order to subtly tell the viewer that the upcoming scene, times or sequences will be especially significant to the lives of the characters, followed by a shift in editing style to highlight the stresses that the protagonist has gotten himself into - which systematically builds the dramatic tension in the sequence until it results in a conclusive tipping point in his life. Which movie am I describing here? Boogie Nights? Or Goodfellas? Which one came first again? The final scene where our protagonist talks to himself in the mirror and looks back on his experiences is obviously ripped off from Raging Bull rather than Goodfellas, but that is still another Scorsese work.Anderson has nothing to say other than he wants to be thought of as a great director, but he needs to ape the true pioneers that came before him to make that happen. He just needed to make sure he adapted Scorsese's work into the porn world in order to appeal to his adolescent male fan base that eats up anything that helps mainstream their sexual fantasies. Don't fall for the hype. This is an extremely derivative, mediocre work.",

It's not as warm as the film would like to think of itself.The acting in this film is absolutely top flight. Without a single weak link in the cast it steamrolls you, keeping you riveted on even the most trivial characters. Not only is this a career making role for Wahlberg but one that did for Burt Reynolds what Pulp Fiction did for Travolta. Ask anyone what who has seen this film and the usual response is \"Burt is great\". That misses the point however, EVERYONE shines in this film. The director has a lot of actor/actress weapons and he doesn't fail to bring out every single one in this film. Tight interweaving stories bring this family closer to your heart and make you care for what happens to some of these what society considers lowlifes. It humanizes and dehumanizes characters at the same time. With all the sexual posturing and the nature of the business you find the human thread in all of their insecurities as the central axel turning their drive. Sure this story is unlikely but at least it tells a human story to an inhuman business.After re-watching this film after a few years it still has one of my favorite scenes in any film ever. This scene known as \"Long Way Down (one more thing)\" is involves a long camera shot of Mark Wahlberg staring off into space sitting on a couch contemplating his life. I can't explain why but it was like magic on film that you just don't get anywhere else in my opinion. Sad in a way, that more people remember the film by the `money shot' delivered in the final scene than a few of the others great ones.

But I'm glad I saw it once and would recommend it to anybody else who likes PTA's stuff--Magnolia and Punch Drunk Love first and foremost.  Be forewarned--like Magnolia, it's over three hours long; unlike Magnolia, it's less of a pure character study and has a bit of a plot, so those who were bored by Magnolia might find this a little more palatable.Boogie Nights follows a young man's rise to porn stardom and subsequent fall.  PTA acknowledges in the DVD commentary that the movie is heavily influenced by and borrows from the life of the real porn star John Holmes, although the story as a whole is not a John Holmes biography.  In the first half of the movie, Marky Mark's character gets into porn and becomes a huge star.  In the second half, he does too much coke, gets full of himself, falls dramatically from his throne, and returns to those he rejected for redemption.  We follow the other characters in his little porn \"family\" through this story arc as they also peak and, to varying degrees, fall, and then come back together, their porn \"family\" ultimately intact.  Like all families, this one's defining characteristic is that it sticks together in spite of rifts and occasional tragedy.Like all of PTA's movies, this one is heavily character-oriented.  The movie is about things happening to people instead of people acting out a plot, if you get the distinction.Artistically, this movie is excellent.  I am repeatedly impressed by PTA's camera direction.  He loves to use long steadicam or handheld shots, and by long I mean maybe one to three minutes.  I think they're beautiful, innovative, and creative.  He also has a knack for making transitions through the use of the camera--a car containing one character drives down the road as the camera peels away to follow a car going the other way containing another character, for example.  I love these little touches.Overall, I give the movie a 3/5 even though I probably wouldn't see it again.  I wouldn't be adverse to it, though... Well worth seeing once.",

            "content": "Though I do realize what a sleazy piece of toss Boogie Nights is as opposed to some of the better, classier flicks down the course of film history, I guess I'd have to honestly admit that the reason I still after about 2-3 years of watching it on cable love it, is for the reason it does take me back to the good, old days - the 70s - and does identify w/ my taste in 70s porno. Being that I am a Holmes' fan now and then, I'm surprised that none I've read so far pointed out that Boogie Nights was supposed to parodize the lives of certain pornographers throughout it's history.\nFor instance critics believe that the scene where Reynolds stomps the hell out of that poor dope on the street is suppose to mirror the events in Jamie Gillis' life, since he was responsible for the first-ever pro-am flick, though I don't know if he resorted to that sort of violence. And there are other parodies of real-lives, but just for instance. If you know any thing about erotica's history then you'll be able to recognize the parallels.\nOn the downside, you have Marky Mark, John Reilly and friends snorting lots of coke, being idiotic and undesirable, and wasting about two hours of our time. However, I'm glad Reynolds back to work again. I haven't seen him in anything recent since Smokey and the Bandit.",

            "content": "What a breathtaker.  God bless P.T. Anderson's for creating a film that rockets the sockets.  With a brilliant screenplay, set design, wardrobe, cinematography, editing, soundtrack, and most of all casting; Anderson plunges head-first into the world of pornography in California's San Fernando Valley, circa 1977, chronicling its rise and fall over 6 years. Burt Reynolds, delivering one of the finest and most unexpected performances ever in film, plays Jack Horner - a middle-aged, world-weary porn director who sees his work as true art and not simply as a masturbation device. He plucks busboy Eddie Adams - already suffering from a horribly comfortable middle-class existence - from inside a discoteque, due to his particularly large endowment.  Eddie christens himself Dirk Diggler, begins a career as a porn actor while we ride with Dirk to the top of the porn mountain and down to the cocaine-addled mess that becomes his life.  As Dirk, Mark Wahlberg delivers a captivating performance that probably no one was expecting at the time.  Wahlberg more or less carries the film both as a suave, schoolyard bully and a fragile, wounded child.This rollercoaster has an extremely colorful cast of characters that become Dirk's surrogate family.  Jack is Dirk's new father, ripe porn queen Amber Waves serves as Dirk's mother.  Other porno actors, including the impressionable Reed Rothchild, clueless Buck Swope, roller-skating Rollergirl, and chocolate-breasted Becky Barnett become Dirk's brothers & sisters.  All the while Anderson pumps out a nicely varied collection of 70's musical gems; equally mixing rock, soul, funk, disco, R&B and even folk.  The entire cast of this film is flawless - EVERYBODY performs superbly.  Mark Wahlberg, Burt Reynolds, Julianne Moore, John C. Reilly, Don Cheadle, Heather Graham, Phillip Baker Hall, Luis Guzman, William H. Macy, Ricky Jay, Nicole Ari Parker, Robert Ridgely, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Melora Walters, Alfred Molina - these actors are all wonderfully fantastic in this film.I won't waste time saying who plays who, enjoy the discovery (or rediscovery) yourself; they all shine marvelously.  You cannot blame Anderson for reuniting most of these actors for \"Magnolia\" - they work uniformly under his eye.  Anderson is a triple threat because he's an actor's director, a writer's director and a director's director - all in one.  If \"Boogie Nights\" is only his second film, we are bound to witness greatness from this guy for years and years to come.Certainly the best film of 1997, Anderson's frenetic storytelling skills works wonders as he doses all his characters with a healthy fraction of empathy; we even understand the bad guys (and their motives), yet we're still not made to feel sorry for them.  What particularly impresses me about this film is Anderson's ability as a writer to express the thoughts & feelings of characters who would be considered less than intelligent by many people.  You may be quick to call them \"dumb\", but Anderson isn't so harsh; he feels they are simply people who cannot articulate themselves very well. I love the ever-present sympathy he has.  Many detractors of this film claim the cinematography borrows too heavily from Scorsese while the editing technique employs the work of Altman a little too often.  Indeed, like many Scorsese \"disciples\", Anderson wears his \"Scorsese Camera Badge\" a lot more heavily than Spike Lee or Oliver Stone.  Still, it's used to such dizzying effect in accordance with a fantastic screenplay & cast that after a while you forget he's doing so (unless you spend the entire film judging it as it goes along).  I really felt like I was in the 70's throughout this movie, immersed in everything beautiful & wonderful it had to offer, as well as its consequences, even though I was born in the middle of that decade.  What a glorious spin from P.T. Anderson and his ENTIRE cast & crew - they created the perfect time warp.  This film is a sign that all of us can be rescued from the Jerry Bruckheimer hell that is Hollywood.",

It's a modern masterpiece with just one weakness, which I'll get to later. And forget about the latex; that's NOT what this film is about.The normally dislikeable Mark Wahlberg is a waiter who earns some extra bucks showing his outsized appendage to paying customers. His \"talent\" is spotted by Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds), a director of pornographic films. The film is set mainly in the Seventies, the decade where pornography nearly became a legitimate art form. He is taken to Horner's house and is quickly seduced by the \"glamour\" of the porn industry. He adopts the moniker Dirk Diggler and it is not long before he's a porno star. That's only half the story. The film then takes a decidedly dark turn as we enter the eighties. Diggler develops a nasty coke habit which begins to affect his performance. He drops out and has to resort to getting fellated in darkened cinemas by homosexuals. Reynolds, meanwhile has his own problems, as the industry shifts from cinema to video.The film skillfully balances humour with high drama, often shifting gear from one scene to the next. A good example is the fate of Little Bill's wife. It is also, in essence, a sad film, telling of broken dreams, drug addiction, failed relationships.It is also one of those films with many great scenes: the camera following the girl as she dives into the swimming pool, Julianne Moore (possible the film's most sympathetic character) and Heather Graham doing coke together, the armed robbery gone wrong, Wahlberg and John C. o' Reilly in the recording studio.There's also a great soundtrack. The Beach Boys' God only knows represents one of the beat uses of a song in any film I've seen (second, perhaps only to Your song in Breaking the Waves). Hell, the film's so good it nearly made me like Rick Springfield.And the cast. wahlberg, Reynolds, Graham and Moore are basically the main actors. While there performances are good (particularly Reynolds), in my mind it's the character actors who make the film. John C. o' Reilly, Don Cheadle, Philip Seymour Hoffman, the great Luis Guzman, William H. Macy. All give magnificent performances.OK. There's brilliant scriptwriting and direction by Paul Thomas Anderson, fine cinematography and music, and terrific acting. So are there any flaws? Yes, the ending. Somehow the picture of Burt Reynolds walking around his house like some mother hen just doesn't ring true. But that's a minor carp and won't stop me watching this movie again and again.",

Hey, it's better than wallowing through Nic Cage's snuff vehicle in \"9mm\".  \"Boogie Nights\" has some great characters.  Most notably is Mark Wahlberg who is blessed with some . . . ahem . . . sizable talents, Burt Reynolds as the fatherly direcor, Heather Graham as the super-sexy Rollergirl, and Julianne Moore as the motherly performer.The atmosphere is terrific and action flows remarkably well.  Director P. T. Anderson makes an intriguing character study out of an otherwise shallow and voyeuristic subject matter.  \"Boogie Nights\" obviously has its share of sexual content and nudity, but not to an overblown or gratuitous degree.Of course, it does get annoying after a while to sit through the ignorance of the central character's mentalities but some remarkable scenes will probably keep a viewer riveted.  Unfortunately, the final half hour of the film is dedicated to Tarantino-esque violence that does not fit well with its quality drama, but this part of the film, as well, has its classic moments.  Especially the donut shop mayhem and the \"Jessie's Girl\" drug deal (talk about unforgettable, Alfred Molino is hysterical).Don't look for \"Gone With The Wind\" qualities despite the rave reviews, but don't expect the hollowness or qualities of \"Debbie Does Dallas\" either.

This, in my opinion, is vastly superior to Magnolia (which is, by its own right, a great movie). The script is brilliant, the performances are all excellent, and, of course, the soundtrack kicks arse. Shades of Tarantino and Scorcese can be detected in many scenes, yet overall the director has managed to cultivate a style all of his own. And this film also contains some of the most hilarious scenes I have seen in any movie for a long time. For example: the promo for Brock Landers, Dirk and Reed singing 'Feel my Heat', and Cosmo's firecrackers unnerving the three lads on a drugs scam notably crack me up. And hey, what about those long camera takes! The most I have ever seen collectively in a film, blowing dePalma and Scorcese out of the water- the opening shot, Jack's first party, and New Years Eve, in particular, stand out.As for those performances: Wahlberg more than successfully making the transition from singer to actor (lampooning his own singing inadequacies at one point), Good to see Reynolds back on form, Julianne Moore perfect in her part as the 'mother' of the group, and of course, all the other Anderson regulars turning out more than satisfying performances, with Cheadle and Macy's characters effortlessly gaining my complete sympathy.The plot: I didnt really see this film as just being the story of rising (and eventually falling) star Dirk Diggler; instead I saw it simply as the story of a collection of characters in the porn industry over approximately ten years , with their sadness and joys in between. *SPOILER* And the film also boasts some particularly great writing by Anderson in a number of scenes. For example, When Buck Swope is in the donut shop and the robber bursts in, I felt sure that that was the end of Buck Swope- but instead, the outcome is one of the most unpredictable I have seen since the 2nd story in Pulp Fiction.  This is, in short, the kind of film that you want to watch again and again immediately after your first viewing. If you haven't seen it yet, do yourself a favour...",

They perfectly capture the goofy, decadent cluelessness of the late 70's and early 80's.  If you don't like this movie because it's \"idealized\" or doesn't truly capture the porn business, you miss the point-this movie is about a group of slightly deluded outcasts brought together for dubious reasons but finding themselves in the midst of a family. Paul Thomas Anderson was the real star of the movie, however. The period touches were so dead on and he was successful in capturing the palpably different vibes of the late 70's and early-mid 80's. Julianne Moore was totally robbed by not even being nominated for her performance and Burt Reynolds was a shoo-in, in my opinion.

If you watch the trailer, you'll be lead to believe that this is a fairly lighthearted disco film a la \"Saturday Night Fever.\"  But \"boogie,\" as used here, does not refer to the music and dancing of the 1970s club scene.  Instead, it refers to a much more earthy and raw sexuality that pervades this film.  As such, it bears little resemblance to the decade I remember as I fondly reflect.It's obvious from very early into this picture that its intention is to deglamorize the 1970s.  Like Flaubert's \"Madame Bovary,\" this film leaves its viewer completely de-romanticized about the 1970s.  It is a hard-biting drama that hits the viewer upon the head like a sledge- hammer until she or he is completely devoid of romantic illusions about that era.The story concerns a movie director, played by Reynolds, who seduces the idealistic Wahlberg into the porn movie industry and the downward spiral that results for Wahlberg's character.  The industry feeds off his character's enthusiasm and upward mobility and exploits it without mercy.  The other characters are sucked in their own ways into the whirlpool of sex, drugs, and violence that consumes them all.The biggest problem with this movie is not its story, but its pretentions. It is an inaccurate portrayal of experience in the 1970s for all but the very small percentage of people it depicts.  This small percentage is hardly a representative sample of those who lived through the '70s, as the film makes it seem.  As such, it really is a false memoir.It is accurate only when taken as a microcosm of an industry in the '70s, and then only for a small number of people in that industry.  The film should serve as a warning or an eye-opener, because the irony is there is a significant minority of people who suffer quietly under the conditions that the film portrays.  But the grandeur it pretends to affect is a delusion about the 1970s.  I can only give it one star.  It is not pleasant to watch.",

            "review_title": "Hans down for Anderson",
            "content": "Posited on the not uninteresting notion that cinematic entertainment is to be found in the lives of a bunch of people who spend most of their time in a state of undress, Paul Thomas Anderson's `Boogie Nights' is less a reminder of its intended era \u0096 the 1970s \u0096 as of some 100 years earlier, when `The Emperor's New Clothes' was all the rage.Satire purveyed as fairytale, this attacked the self-serving pomposity of a European cultural elite as represented by a sycophantic Court so in thrall to its Emperor that whatever he said, and whatever he did, was unfailingly marvellous. Even when he appeared stark naked and invited admiration of his new clothes, response was fulsome and unquestioning.Fast forward from Andersen's fairy tale to Anderson's film and it's clear from the reviews of so many US critics that the court is still in full swing: the references to Boogie's richness of tapestry and brilliance of detailing could just as well have been culled from the parroting so deservedly ridiculed in `Emperor'.Like Andersen's fairy tale, Anderson's film is about people with no clothes: porno actors doing their thing in 1977's California. Directorially, Anderson is at one with his subject because he hasn't any clothes, either, hence two and quarter hour's worth of the ransacking of other directors' wardrobes.Unfortunately, cinematic dress sense is lacking: where others went for style with purpose, Anderson goes for style per se. The opening sequence is Nicholls-out-of-Altman-out-of-Welles, a three-minute tracking shot concluding with a character on roller skates who promptly absents herself to go for a pee. Dramatic, or what? (One assumes that, out of shot, she then handed over the skates to the camera operator, so that thereafter the lens may hurtle around one static set-up after another in hope of signifying vitality). Anderson, however, has more in his armory than tracking shots and roller skates: Nicholas Ray is in a sub-sub-Deanish confrontation between the film's hero and his deranged mamma; Tarantino arrives as soon as people start shooting each other; Scorsese gets comprehensively ripped off in the unintentionally hilarious climactic scene. As for the bit when Anderson follows a character into the swimming pool and under the surface, a round of applause seems appropriate for Jacques Cousteau.The problem with all this laborious artifice is not that it's there, but that it's there for no reason: you swoop your way into a night club and find absolutely nothing happening, plunge into a pool and, er, find absolutely nothing happening. In fact, so often do you find absolutely nothing at all happening that it's no wonder Anderson finally gets bored himself and moves from sex to its stereotypical concomitant, violence.As a comedy about the porn industry, about the fatuity of its mainstream aspirations and the self-deception of its principal exponents, `Boogie Nights' could have been a refreshing entertainment, audacious yet affectionate, searching yet sympathetic. Unfortunately though, Anderson's script never gets over the novelty of its own pitch -- a movie about 1970s porno people: gosh, wow, how radical! \u0096 and, thus mesmerised, plots its characters' rise and fall in more pedestrian fashion than any porno chronicle of tumescence and aftermath.In the role of the hero, Mark Wahlberg is defeated from the outset: Anderson's script makes him a sleazoid from scene 1, thereby denying any opportunity for examination of innocence traduced. Wahlberg's little sleazoid is disowned by his bonkers mother and becomes a big sleazoid courtesy of his ability to handle a very large part in a succession of porno movies. At this point, Anderson could have found the iconoclasm these dismal proceedings so urgently need and had \u0091Dirk Diggle' living in a mansion and endowing a new hospital. But no: middle-America knows porn is bad, so ergo, the people in it must all come to a bad end. And so Anderson obliges the Moral Majority, trying, but failing, to obscure the predictability of the redemptive route by constructing setpiece events more bizarre than anything encountered by Bunyan's Pilgrim. Discarded by the porno people because of the so-sad truth that there's always a, how can one put it, a new up-and-comer, Dirk sets off to be a singing star, a surprising career move given that he hasn't so much whistled in any preceding scene. More surprising, however, is the fact that Dirk has somehow lost house, car, and bank account in remarkably short time, a disaster that might have elicited some sympathy had Anderson's script bothered to mention it. Instead, all the audience discovers is that the world's most famous and richest porno actor is cruelly thwarted his dream of being a recording star. . . because he can't afford the cost of a demo. Hmm. Sad.Inexplicably bankrupt and demonstrably unmusical, you'd have thought Dirk's mortification was complete. But no: he's now landed in a Tarantino setpiece filmed through one of Fellini's old view-finders, and thus winds up with two ex-porno friends in the baronial living room of a rich loony to whom they'd dearly love to sell baking soda masquerading as coke if only the loony's Asian houseboy would stop running around letting off Chinese fire crackers. Breathtaking cinema? Had an introduction been here effected of a nun on a pogo stick playing a bugle, it's likely US critics would have signed a petition to ensure Anderson's Oscar.As to the fate of others, two are worthy of mention: porno film director Jack Horner, played by Burt Reynolds, and porno actor Buck Swope, played by Don Cheadle. Reynolds, inexplicably nominated for an acting award, decides early on that Jack Horner sat in a corner and thus spends most of the movie doing just that. His expression is glazed and his directorial input, zilch: it's as if the material over which he presides has a life of its own, and somnambulism is all that's required. (The same thought probably occurred to Anderson). Cheadle, whose career \u0096 unlike Reynolds's -- at least looks like surviving this tripe, has a more lively time of it: his character wants to move from low-life to hi-fi, to have his own store in order to sell the eight track cartridge players depicted by Anderson as quintessential 1977 regardless of the fact that by then they were all museum pieces anyway.Although the bank refuses to provide the substantial financing a hi-fi store clearly needs, Cheadle strikes it lucky by first walking into a small bakery to buy doughnuts and then, Bruce Willis-like, by finding himself the Last Man Standing when a homicidal maniac rushes in (as they do, as they do) and everyone else winds up dead. Drenched in gore or possibly, raspberry jam, Cheadle stares at the money the maniac would've taken. There must be all of twenty dollars there. Can he resist the temptation? Apparently not, because in his next scene there he is, proudly opening a new landmark on the block, his very own hi-fi store.That you could buy and equip a hi-fi store with just 20 dollars will come as a surprise to all those who remember the 1970s. Anderson, at 26, doesn't, so it's little wonder that the film overall is about as historically accurate as \"Ben Hur\".Still. `Boogie Nights' is a triumph of sorts, in much the same way that Cheadle's hi-fi store was. With minimal investment in wit, originality or imagination, this unlikely construct has nevertheless been hailed as a landmark on the cinematic block, its distinctly rightwing triteness blithely misrepresented as exactly the opposite. There's no doubt Anderson does have talent, and once he gets over the preoccupation with being young, radical, and free to nick everybody else's directorial styles, he could well assert an identity of his own, beginning, perhaps, with a script that surprises and characters that engage with more than each other.For the US critics though, no redemption is in sight: they're probably still in court now, praising the clothes of the naked director, still listening to their eight tracks and claiming it's real fidelity. . .\nends",

This is really something, because from a technical point of view, everything is well-put together. The photography, scenery and lead actors are all great. Even though, the film's running time is almost three hours, the deep development of the characters and the clever plot gives more and more tension to the viewer. The editing of the movie but the story as well, is a mature look on a world which is unacceptable and offensive for many people. You can decide to not judge the strange family of Dirk Diggler but familiarize with them, even like them and maybe, try to understand them. This film refers to the 70s and 80s when the industry of porn was still evolving fast, when film was replaced from videotapes and when people used to watch soft porn movies in public theaters. Even if the last half of the movie is more violent and dramatic, the movie keeps a balance between the possibility of drama and the option of acceptance and conscience.",

The characters played by William H. Macy and Phillip Hoffman were just pointless and only served to waste screen time. Don Cheadle's character is obsessed with his look and dresses first like Sherrif Bart, and then like Rick James.  This character was mildly interesting, but he didn't serve the story at all.

            "content": "I was really exited to see this film after watching the preview. I went on opening night not knowing what to expect. I wanted to see this movie mainly because of all the stories of wild, care free party life that my parents always talked about (disco, Studio 54 etc) and wanted to see how it translated to film.I was surprised by some of the things that they depicted from that era, but nonetheless, it was well done.My favorite character in the film is Jack Horner who is brilliantly played by Burt Reynolds. His desire to make \"The Great American Adult Film\" is what drives him to be the top director in the business. However, as time goes on and we enter the 80's, he is forced to come to terms that with the advent of the cheaper and easier to film and edit \"videotape\", not to mention the VCR, people no longer care about plots in a porn movie. He also sees that with this technology, people will soon be able to film a porn movie from their own basement for practically nothing and make big bucks. He reluctantly makes the transition, yet, that soon becomes the least of his worries when the 80's begin and life around him and his \"family\" slowly begin to unravel.The saddest point in the film for me is when rollergirl (played wonderfully by a very sexy Heater Grahm) encounters someone from her past( you have to see it for yourself) and the brutal scene that follows her encounter with this person. The other Characters in the movie were well picked for their roles, most notably Julianne Moore. Mark Wahlberg's character was terrific also but I liked the supporting characters more.Mind you, this is not a no-hold barred film about porn, but a story of people involved in the porn scene in the 70's and 80's.

Mark Whalberg who was really good in Basketball diaries tries his best to make an awful part good but he can't pull it off.  Alfred Molina is a pathetic over the top joke.  John C Reily looks dazed and confused and is better off taking small roles in films like A Thin Red Line then trying to co-star in garbage like this.

            "content": "I had so many problems with this movie. I understood that it was cinematic genius and ended up with cinematic excrement. I came into the movie uninfluenced by the good reviews it naturally gets, but it was still to no avail. Here's my beef:First, Boogie Nights tried to hard to have that deep message about how a life of moral decadence leads to regret and a general waste of innocence. We all know this, we all think about how empty the dirty stripper is on the inside. Second, I have no beef with Anderson, it's just that his cinematography was so over the top. I fully understand that he has the capability to make long shots on tracks, cranes, dollies or with a steady cam, but not every single shot has to be a long shot. I don't want a porno version of Raging Bull. Third, Burt Reynolds really didn't deserve an Oscar nomination for his role. It was a good character, but not nomination worthy. The only thing he deserves is the Awesome Mustache Trophy Fourth, this movie gets so much damn praise from people. I can't figure out why. I think it's the classic ideology that something risqu\u00e9 has to be good. This movie is over inflated because of the type of content (in this case, the pornographic type) in Boogie Nights instead of the quality of the content (which was weak). Fifth, this movie was filled with too many 70's stereotypes. It was overdone. Sixth, Mark Wahlberg's acting wasn't that great. It was subpar at best. I'll give it him on that he was good in the scene recording his album because it was pretty funny. Regardless, he was too dramatic and and over worked the nonchalant attitude of his character. Seventh, too many useless characters. I love William H. Macy, but his character was useless. I'm indifferent on Phillip Seymour Hoffman, but he too was useless. Eighth, this movie had that feel where if you keep waiting patiently, it will get better. It never did. I hate when movies do that. Ninth, I personally think the writing for this movie was unimaginative and boring. Such a clich\u00e9 story, boy goes on his own, boy makes porn and becomes rich and famous, boy finds drugs and hits the gutter, boy finds his way back to glory. Seen it before, let's write something new. Tenth, too many useless side stories. If Anderson would have completely cut out the black guy making it in the stereo business with stolen money, Phillip Seymour Hoffman's homosexual journey, Luis Guzman's club adventures and William H. Macy's marital frustrations and this movie might have been somewhat less aimless.Overall 2.3 out of 10.",

On the surface, it is just a movie about a guy who gets into the porn industry, but underneath that, it is really about the people involved in the story and their lives outside of porn and because of porn. The characters are what make it come alive. t's kind of like Pulp Fiction. The story itself isn't really all that fascinating, but the characters in the movie are just very interesting. That's what makes the movie so good.I was fascinated by the character played by Philip Seymour Hoffman. I was fascinated by Amber Waves and her relationship with Dirk and her relationship with her own real life son. Every character had their own personality and there was a part of me that cared about all of them (even if only a little).",

I wasn't too happy to be 'paying' to see a movie about the porn industry (not my favourite subject matter) with Mark Walhberg and Burt Reynolds who weren't two of my favourite actors at the time but all that has changed. I was surprised to see it was an excellent film. This isn't solely about the porn industry, this is about the people behind it and their lives and feelings. Mark Wlahberg is superb and Burt Reynolds is at one of his very best, the rest (Julianne Moore, Heather Graham, John C. Reilly and many others) hold their own respectively. The opening scene at a nightclub which is just one long cut makes for excellent veiwing, and one powerfully emotionally raw scene where Dirk (Eddie at the time) gets thrown out of home with only the clothes he's wearing on his back. All in all it's an excellent film and is well worth the watch. If you ask me, this should have swept The Oscars instead of silly, stupid, no-story, Titanic. This film focuses on 'real' people's feelings instead of special effects. But even so you don't need a few gold statues to say whether this is a good film or not, this is excellent with Oscars or without.",

            "content": "PTA's Magnolia is one of my favorite movies so I naturally watched Boogie Nights after seeing Magnolia. Boogie Nights is a sex-negative morality play that teaches, like a Catholic nun, that sex is bad. PTA doesn't even include a monogamous married couple to portray the many blessings that are rained down upon a monogamous marriage between a man and a woman. But you'll quickly see that seems to be one of the takeaways from the conclusion of the film - and the more sexually active the person, the more likely that they will not be able to continue relationships with their biological families.Stereotyping porn actors is just weak. The two youngest, Dirk (Wahlberg) and Rollergirl (Graham) are high school dropouts and not very bright. No one is very bright in the movie with the exception, maybe, of Reynolds' Jack Horner character but even he's out of touch with good taste as he naively calls one of his porn flicks a 'real movie' that will preserve his memory.The first lesson we learn is that a marriage that is not monogamous can only end in murder-suicide. Little Bill (Macy - does the little moniker mean that he has a small organ unlike those in the porn films?) is shamed by his sexually active wife (played by real-life porn star Nina Hartley - a pro-porn defender and long involved with a man and another woman in an alternative relationship) so he naturally murders his wife and her lover and then commits suicide. Because, you know, that's what cuckolds do, right? Little Bill is involved in the porn industry and although Hartley is never seen as an actress in Horner's films, she's a serial adulteress and she gets her just reward.Dirk learns his lesson when he thinks that his success is a result of his smarts as much as his organ size just when his organ is failing him because of drug use. He separates from Horner, taking a couple of his buddies with him but they leave him before he falls upon hard times. Hard times, we're to assume, means being picked up by men who want to watch him handle his organ as they handle their own. We just have to assume this as the only scene that indicates some experience in these matters is a single scene in which he is pummeled by guys in trucks who are just out for a night of gay bashing. Lesson? You might be gifted with a large organ but you'll never be smart.Third and final lesson. This one is tricky - even those who are successful outside of the porn industry (by luck, theft, whatever) have been forever marked by their association and the artificial families that they have created are the only ones that they can depend upon. In the end they are all united under Jack Horner's wing to continue in the porn industry.It's been 20 years since Boogie Nights' release. Pornography on the internet has become almost respectable with the 'amateur' streaming clips being popular and men by the millions having (to me, completely twisted) cuckold fantasies. Twenty years on anyone can be a porn star and hold a PhD in sociology. The aforementioned Nina Hartley began her porn career in 1984 and graduated from nursing school in 1985. In the little research that I've done it simply doesn't seem that the nascent porn film industry was filled with stupid high school drop-outs. Revisiting some of the most successful films of the time you may find more eroticism than in the 10-20 minute videos of today. And you might alternately find that there are very well educated men and women actually enjoying non-monogamous and non-traditional sex.Boogie Nights just doesn't stand up to scrutiny or scholarship. It doesn't even present much in the way of the times when people had public hair.One final note. The cuckold fantasy is one of those 'be careful what you wish for' fantasies. A real woman has fantasies of her own and - surprise! - they may not include you. Your fantasy may be just what she needs to have relations with another guy... as 10 other guys watch. Encourage a woman's lesbian fantasies and she might leave you for another woman. Each person is sexually unique - like a fingerprint - and before becoming involved with anyone in a sexual relationship you need to know a few things up front. Even if the person is fulfilling your sex with a stranger fantasy you need to know a few things. You won't learn much about sex watching Boogie Nights. The only history that you may learn is that when porn came out of the film theaters and onto home video, there was an explosion in sales and proliferation in product. Did the transition mean less artistic products? I don't think so... not every film of the time was a 'Behind the Green Door.'",

            "content": "Although the lifestyles of the characters in this movie are deplorable, they are well portrayed. I'm not familiar with the 70's porn industry, but I can definitely see how that kind of self-gratifying life of debauchery would lead to bigger problems like drug addiction, depression, and desperation. The characters I enjoyed most were \"Amber Waves\" and \"Buck Swope\", because to me they were the most believable. They were the only two characters (besides \"Colonel\") with any redemptive value; namely, that there are unavoidable consequences for our actions and the life we choose for ourselves.The one part that didn't fit at all for me was Rollergirl. She made no sense whatsoever. I guess she's supposed to be the Traci Lords equivalent -- a girl who drops out of high school for full-time sex. Okay, so what. Big deal, right? But what's up with the limo scene where Jack picks up a guy off the street to film having sex with Rollergirl in the backseat, and then when he doesn't do it right they get all upset, kick him out of the car and beat him senseless? \"Don't you ever disrespect me!\" Duh?! What's there to respect about her? She invited him into the car to have sex with her and then turns on him! I don't even know why they cast the part of Rollergirl at all, other than to see if Heather Graham would cave in and finally shed her clothes on film (which she did).Well, enough ranting and raving. Overall, I thought the movie achieved its goal. The bad acting portrayed was just perfect, it really helped you get an idea of how shallow these movies really are. And just for a laugh, Dirk's incredible prosthetic at the end was worth the ticket price alone (no, it wasn't real).",

            "content": "This is a classic \"rise and fall\" plot set in the 1970s porn industry. There are two main elements of the movie that make it both endearing and unforgettable: the characters and the music.Director Paul T. Anderson brought together a highly eclectic and talented cast of actors to portray the abundance of characters.  The three most notably stand-out performances definitely belonged to Mark Wahlberg, Julianne Moore and Burt Reynolds.  They kept the movie together even during some of the more weaker plot areas around the falling out of Diggler and Horner.  They brought highly believeable characters on-screen.  One of the most telling talents of any actor is to show a very distinct difference between acting and acting as though you were acting.  See the line drawn in the first movie Eddie films as Dirk Diggler.  Wahlberg and Moore show how natural they are before the filming and then show cardboard cut-outs of themselves in front of the camera.  Anyone who has ever seen a porn film from this era can see how true to character they portrayed the filming. \nIf the plot and the characters weren't enough to keep you hooked , Anderson adds music from the era that gives it the right feeling for the times.  He also knows what songs to play during certain plot points.  Notice how all the songs played from the pool party through Dirk Diggler's initial success as a porn star are all upbeat, while the later scenes where he is in a downward spiral are all ominous and foreboding.It took a couple of viewings to fully appreciate the brilliance in Anderson's dialogue and camera angles.  I loved that scene where he follows the girl into the pool underwater and right into Dirk and Reed on the other side.  It was fluid and highly unorthodox.  Another brilliant stroke were the scenes near the end where he expertly showed Jack, Dirk and Buck have interesting experiences on the same night and all within a few blocks of each other without ever running into each other.  This film is definitely a must see.  Though the main plot point was about a young man becoming a porn star, it had very little nudity and even fewer sexual situations.  The drug scene that was definitely rampant in the 70s and early 80s is much more noticeable.  Anderson obviously has the makings of a Scorcese or a Tarantino, and this movie will be the one people will remember as the first of many brilliant movies.",

Here's why. It's brilliant.I realise that isn't really a great review so I'll have to give some reasons. First of all, the characters (as in 'Magnolia') are so well-rounded you feel you could watch them sleep. The screenplay (Oscar-nommed I believe) is tender and bizarre (\"Will you be my mom?\") and should have won the Oscar. The storyline documents the rise and fall of not only people, not only and industry but a whole era and I don't think any other film has done that quite as well since 'GoodFellas'.

Julianne Moore is tremendous as well, Don Cheadle nails his role dead on. Burt Reynolds is the perfect actor for his part and does not dissapoint. Heather Graham takes a role that many actresses would have shied away from and she just runs with it, lending an odd innocence to the film, while remaining sexy as the role demands. John C. Reilly, consistently lives his roles in Anderson's films, no wonder he keeps returning in them, he is great also. Philip Seymour Hoffman once again turns in a performance deeper than the role he was given, no surprise there. There are so many fine performances in this film, it is hard to define them all, but Mark Wahlberg had his coming out party here, he was surrounded by talented actors, but his role was pivotal to the success of the film, and he delivered.

Mark Wahlberg is absolutely fantastic in this movie, too bad its the only convincing performance on his resume to date. He carries this movie expertly and really was snubbed of an Academy Award nomination. I guess the academy just couldn't get past the fact that they would be nominating the former leader of the funky bunch.The supporting cast is also fantastic. Julianne Moore is fantastic in every movie she is in, and this one is no different. She almost steals all of her scenes. Heather Graham surely peaked with this performance since she has been dreadful in everything else - but she certainly was convincing here. William H. macy is fantastic, Phillip Seymour Hoffman is the best character actor in the business, so its no surprise he was good - and John C. Reilly is one of the most underrated actors out there. Will he ever get the credit he deserves - plus his name was Chest Rockwell in one of the movies!\nBut Burt Reynolds steals the movie - he was absolutely perfectly cast and was almost hypnotic to watch. I can't BELIEVE they gave the Oscar to Robin Williams - nothing against him, but c'mon people. Anderson has gone on to direct the riveting Magnolia - and the recently released, and equally fascinating Punch Drunk Love.

But get to the point, Boogie Nights is a movie that will be remembered by the Oscar nominations, sex and of course the last part.*****************SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS********************** This movie is somewhat funny to me. First, the porn names, oh dear there so funny, they make no sense and there just funny. When Dirk looks at himself in the mirror all the time and sees his penis, its pretty silly. When that guy kills his wife and himself because his wife is always having sex its pretty funny. When Mark and Julianne have the sex scene when they are filming, I'm sorry, but he comes to quick. The scene when that guy kisses Dirk, oh dear i should of known he was weird. One of my favorite characters is definitely Rollergirl, how she beat up that guy with her roller blades was very disturbing. Ouch!!!!!!! I did not expected to see Julianne or Heather naked and sniffing. When Dirk masturbates in the car is pretty weird because that guy wants to, pretty weird. But definitely the movie will be remembered by is the end. The stupid long and very fake penis oh god that thing was so funny and fake. At least try to make it look real. That made movie history of course. Still this movie is pretty good with an upbeat look and enjoyable must-see cast. This movie is definitely a unique experience you will have watching a semi-porn movie 3.5 out of 4 stars. A deserving and powerful film",

            "content": "Believable dialog and clever camera usage makes not a good movie.  This is a non movie.  It practically feels like the writer wrote this piece thinking only about the camera, and performances.  There is volumes more to writing than those elements.  This is a would be moral tale with no substance.  It attempts to be honest; gritty, yet we have absurd plot twists, Dukes of Hazard style action scenes, and a happy ending, almost out of no where, showing how well these character's lives went, and good things happen to people who try... Are we talking real life here, Anderson, or fantasy.   The movie ATTEMPTS to be an ensemble character piece, and for that it is an out and out utter failure.  What can you say of these characters having watched this movie.  What do we learn about these characters, their views; their pasts?  Almost nothing!  Too many characters, only one of which (Dirk) is reasonably developed.   In a film like AS GOOD AS IT GETS, not only is it ENTERTAINING, the film speaks volumes of its characters.  Boogie Nights seems to only exceed in visual style and acting.  Visually, Anderson's work resembles Scorcesse, without any of the subtext.  But he is 1/1000th of the storyteller that  Scorcesse is.  Look at that closing scene of Boogie Nights and compare it to the final Raging Bull scene.  A point is being made in Raging Bull, a final conclusion to the story, his whole life, Jake, himself was the enemy.  What can we say of the end of Boogie Nights?  Dirk likes his penis.  After a good opening, say the first twenty minutes, this film becomes a boring, meandering barrage of a porn stars rise to fame.  THEN... when the writer realizes his work has become TOO boring for the mainstream, he decided to throw in some obligatory violence.  Which, if better set up like a good writer might know how to do, could work.  This is a ninety minute story (if that) as told in two and a half hour bloated style.  I think the reason some have taken to a picture like this is because, it visually looks good, is well acted, and has a great soundtrack, but beyond that, what is there?  There is no discernible plot.  Now, I have no problem with the content of this film.  I think a powerful, REALISTIC film on this subject matter could have been made.  But this sure as hell isn't it.  With his visual flair I'm sure Anderson one day may be able to amount into a story teller.",

Well at least it's an original topic. What I really liked about the movie is the cult way it is filmed. Not too much steadycam, keep it a bit shaky. It is also interesting to see what goes on around the 'actors' in a porn movie. I especially liked the way Burt Reynolds played a porn director, who wants to make a porn movie with storyline, good acting and style(not the usual garbage). The movie has some strange twists, but that comes with the genre I guess. I think it's a must see!",

I think the movie has a strong appeal to me because the fact that in the years 1977 to 1980 were my youth. No I was not into pornography except for a reading of Penthouse once in a while but Boogie Nights has an un canny ability to reflect the attitudes and behaviors of this time.

Besides Heather Graham taking off her top, I didn't know what to expect.  Sure, the movie is raunchy, but you have to expect the degree of raunchiness this movie has before you check it out. Despite the trashiness of the main characters, the movie was well acted and actually does have some moral value.  Mark Wahlburg does well as John Travolta wannabe Dirk Diggler.  He does a really good mood change from being a naive, somewhat modest high school dropout turned fresh young porn star in the 70's, to being a stuck-up, drug addicted, low on his game nobody in the 80's.  Burt Reynolds was the actor in this that, if you hated the whole movie, you'd probably like his role because he plays it so well. Especially where he'd make this movie that was obviously terribly acted, and he'd say to his producer, \"This is the best piece of work I've ever created.\" Robert Ridgly, as Colonal Jack, also had a pretty powerful scene.  The scene where he was talking to Reynolds from jail is pretty powerful. Overall, this is a hard movie to get in the mood with.  The characters and plot are hard to understand at first, but you'll like it.  I give it an A-. This movie will shock you, make you laugh, maybe make you cry, and it takes a lot of risks.  Note to guys:  Wahlburg drops out an 18 inch rubber dick from his pants at the end of the movie.  Be prepared to avert your eyes at all costs.",

T. Anderson did a masterful job with this thing. If you ask me, he borrowed a little too much from the Scorsese book of filmmaking but he pulled it off none the less. I was blown away when I saw for the first time 4 years ago (damn, it's been that long?) and it still blows me away now.The entire cast was terrific. This was the movie that made people forget that Mark Whalburg used to dance around in his Calvins for a living...Ok, maybe not totally forget. His performance as Dirk Diggler was beautiful. Not in a million years did I think that Marky Mark was capible of that kind of Acting. Burt Reynolds did his best work since his cameo in Smokey and the Bandit III and truly deserved the Oscar. And the list of great acting goes on: Jullianne Moore, Don Cheadle, Phillip Seymore Hoffman, Heather Graham, and most notably John C. Reiley. They all shined.And to the people who complained that the movie turned into a downer once the action hit the 80's, that was the point. Life isn't all a bowl cherries or even mandarin oranges. There are times of depression and despair. And if you can't handle that, take your money and go see the latest Freddie Prinze Jr. flick.

Anderson's script manages to juggle various story lines and turn them into one cohesive film. His command of such a large film is astonishing, as it never feels as if he loses control over the plot or characters. This is achieved largely through the use of a family dynamic among the characters, giving them a connection strong enough to hold their plot lines together. An all-star cast manages to make every character compelling enough to justify their own film, and by the end you want to spend more time with these characters. The film does manage to run into some problems in the final act, when things start to feel a little rushed and Paul Anderson's boundless energy is misused. Overall, Boogie Nights marked the emergence of the most talented filmmaker working today, and remains a classic in its own regard.",

So what, exactly, is so great about this 1997 film set in the 1970's and 1980's porn industry?Well, for one thing, it is beautifully written and directed. Paul Thomas Anderson's writing is perfect because it hits just the right note at just the right time. Every character has an equal amount of depth (although the film focuses on just one), and it is interesting to watch them interact with each other. The film is practically unequaled in how it makes the audience become invested in its characters. And Anderson's long takes and tracking shots help each actor to truly step into their roles, making for a truly personal film.Boogie Nights is an essential film for anyone who loves the art form or is interested in the art of film directing or writing, and I would recommend it to anyone. That is; as long as they don't mind a little vulgar dialogue and content. It is the porn industry, after all.",

Anderson tries to conceal his formulaic fable by adding in a few gimmicks: well-known actors, nostalgic 70s music, a few entertaining scenes, his trademark long-shot, etc...Simply put, I think the story lacked depth. The open-ended nature of the story provided no global goal for any of the characters to achieve, and the last hour of the film felt unterminable.Then again, as I read over the other comments, I see that perhaps this is one of those \"love / hate\" movies. In any case, if you really must see it, I advise you to rent Boogie Nights along with another movie, and if you find yourself thinking \"Where is this going?\" early in the story, you can start watching your second movie and answer \"Back to the store\".",

We get the first cliche' with Eddie Adams(Mark Wahlberg)a suburbian boy that dreams of one day being a star eventhough he really doesnt know what he would be good for.The Second cliche-the  discovery. Where as Lana Turner was discovered when she was drinking soda at at pharmacy counter minding her own, Eddie Adams was discovered working at a nightclub but it wasn't Jack Horner that set his eyes on Eddie, Eddie set his eyes on him.Eddie beckoned Jack to approach him to propose a price for viewing his large member. And how lucky he was that the person Eddie picked to do so was a porno film director.In the interim. Many stories abound as to where some start such as Marilyn Monroe,Lana Turner and such, had to give sexual favors to people who promised them a chance at stardom. Enter Eddie Adams. He knew what he was getting to and relished the thought that he would be having sex before and behind the camera to make his star rise.The fourth cliche-stardom rising. This is the only instance where Eddie Adams, now as Dirk Diggler, has something in common with main stream stars- time to live in luxury. Dirk moves into his own house and decorates it with the best linens on his bed and a shiny red Corvette in his garage.The fifth cliche-Swelled up head. Like mainstream stars, Dirk Diggler gets a swollen head. He tells the man that discovered him, a legend in the porn industry, that he would be nothing if it wasnt for his great \"big dick.\" He alienates his friends and goes into a depression. He abuses drugs and sells showings of his big member to street perverts.The last cliche- the comeback. Most stars never get a chance to be famous again. Mamie van Doren ended up doing \"nudie\" films when her star fell. In thsi instance Dirk Diggler(Eddie Adams) went back to where he became famous-in  porno films.\nBoogie Nights takes the old Hollywood \"rise and fall of its stars\" cliches except uses the porn film industry as its source. This movie does to this genre what Rocky and the Karate Kid did to all sports cliched film. There can never be another movie like Boogie Nights that deals with the rise and fall of a star-porno or main stream. Boogie Nights is cliched but it works and it should never be tried again.

I'm a not that familiar with Anderson's other films, but I sincerely hope if he has tackled any other \"based on a true story\" themes, he has indeed been more ACCURATE! For starters, the film claims to have been based \"loosely\" on the famous (or infamous) porn star, John C. Holmes, and his turbulent life.  They may have gotten the \"meteoric rise and fall\" part right, but in no way did this film reflect anywhere close to what John Holmes' life was like, especially in the pornography industry.  I guess Anderson must have felt, for the public to truly accept it, he must sugarcoat (if that's possible) the story a little. It wasn't nearly as tragic or brutal as Holmes' life, so apparently that would never sell. More so, everybody has raved about the cinematography of this film, and to be honest, it's just average.  That goes to show that in the post-modern world we live in,  people's standards have slipped, have less knowledge about art and art in film, and are obviously more easily impressed by not their own opinions, but the media's... Burt Reynolds at least got to salvage his career by not taking a totally cheesy role again, and that's about all the credit I can give Anderson on this film.  Mark Wahlberg is clearly a terrible actor, and anybody who believes he IS good, must be in the 14-21 year old demographic somewhere. Further evidence this film is a lemon, long time porn star Juliet \"Aunt Peg\" Anderson clearly stated that the film's \"behind-the-scenes\" vibe regarding the industry in the late 70's/early 80's was vehemently wrong!",

It's kind of hard for me to explain without spoiling it so I'm going to stop avoiding spoilers from here on out with this review.All I was trying to get across is that after Dirk hits it big and has a falling out with his producer, that's where the real conflict of the story starts. Every good story has a conflict, that's Writing 101. The problem for me is when at the end of the film, all that Dirk needs to do is say sorry and everyone lives \"happily ever after\". Also, the scene where Don Cheadle's character witnesses the robbery at the bakery and comes across all that cash; that's a really great scene. The problem is that it was pretty much just dumb luck and all it did for the story was give the character a free pass towards a happy ending with everyone else.

Not to mention art direction that re-creates the late seventies and early eighties in a way that suddenly makes one realize how time flies. I was reminded of Scarface - note that violence in that film is what sex is in this one. What makes Boogie nights so fascinating is the uncanny sense of \"reality\" it creates, while drawing you into the very \"fake\" world of the porn business. Somehow there's tragedy in all these shattered dreams that look like cheap old TV shows. The last 60 minutes are sheer torture, but they kept my eyes glued to the screen.

            "content": "P.T. Anderson is one of a few directors who will attempt to make a movie out of a script that includes a varied mishmash of characters. He is one of even fewer who can actually make it work. In Boogie Nights we meet the likes of Dirk Diggler, Jack Horner, Amber Waves, Buck Swope, Reed Rothschild, and many others. They take us on an unforgettable journey through the porn industry from its heyday in film in the late seventies to its conversion to video in the early eighties. Seventeen year old Eddie has a special talent that the keen eyes of mega-porn director Jack Horner can't miss. Rejected by his family Eddie is soon transformed into Dirk Diggler, the \"biggest\" star in the adult film industry. Dirk also becomes a part of a new family with a new mother (Amber Waves), a sister (Roller Girl), a brother (Reed Rothschild) and of course Jack Horner as father. He also inherits a whole host of uncles, aunts, and cousins. He makes money, buys dope, and becomes a somebody that his biological family never thought he could be. The porn industry is viewed by the outside world in two ways. There are those who condemn it as immoral and obscene and even a few who believe it should be illegal. The other side views it as entertainment and enjoys the physical pleasure they can achieve by engulfing in its visual hedonmism. The bottom line is that both groups ask the question \"Should sex be a commodity?\" Of course both sides give different answers. Anderson does not let either side get off so easy because he lets us know that these are real people with real problems, just like everybody else. Those who would like to censor porn are forced to see that these people aren't the evil spawn that foreshadow apocalyptic events and the porn consumers are shown that these people are more than just nymphomaniacs waiting to mate with the next thing coming down the street. No, they are real people that relate to each other in real ways. Some get married and have children, others have careers/hobbies outside of the porn industry like music and magic, some are confused about their sexual orientation, others have addiction problems. Before long these people don't look much different from the people that judge them as righteous or unrighteous. Anderson does not allow us the clear black and white picture we so desire in order to judge not so much upon the porn industry, but those who participate in its production. I personally believe the porn industry trivializes and abuses both those involved in its production and those who traffic in its products. My first viewing of the film left me depressed at the sad outlook on life most characters had at the end of the film. Upon further viewing I found something hopeful in this movie. Despite the fact that the people in this movie take a human act and reduce it to animalistic sensationalism, these people still care for each other and show the quality that still makes us human. They still love each other even though it might be in an imperfect way. They hurt each other, they forgive, they reconcile and they love. If there is room for that in an industry that reduces lovemaking to a product to be bought and sold, then maybe there is still hope for us all.",

He has less presence than most of the others, although I think it's fairly clear that his character was conceived as having quite a bit of nebbish in him, which hardly allows for much strong presence.The casting is good. The appearance is good. The soundtrack is inspired. The soundtrack establishes the movie in time and place and that's important, because the story is deeply rooted in it's time, and, especially, it's place.BOOGIE NIGHTS is a quintessential Los Angeles, movie industry film. It's a film *about* Hollywood in the 70s and 80s, and that, I think, is the key to understanding what the movie is about, and at least part of the key towards understanding why it seemed so popular among Hollywood people.Pornography is the setting of the story, but, in a real sense, the pornographic film subset of the entertainment industry is almost a McGuffin in BOOGIE NIGHTS. The deepest theme of the film is something along the lines of \"The show must go on\" and that the real role of the people who make movies is to keep making movies. All the rest is detail or distraction. Success is making movies. Life outside making movies is just time spent between making movies. And, when, somehow, life outside making movies interferes with making movies, it's bad.Nothing else is bad. Just things which interfere with making movies. Everything else is forgivable. If it helps make movies, it's not only forgivable, it's actually good.I suggest reviewing BOOGIE NIGHTS with this thesis in mind.The appeal of this idea to people in and around the movie industry ought, I think, be obvious. It provides them something like an ethos. A raison d'etre.And, significantly, it makes for wonderful excuses for every mistake and failing in their lives. Nothing matters as long as movies get made. If you can keep going, you're a winner and you never, ever have to be sorry.You may, perhaps, have to *say* you're sorry, sometime, as Wahlberg's character does when he begs Burt Reynold's character to take him back after a coke-fueled breakup. But, the point is that the apology was the way Diggler got back into making movies. This is the underlying ethic of BOOGIE NIGHTS. And, it's a pretty sad and ugly ethic.",

The makers of films like this have a moral obligation to depict at least a modicum of reality into their productions. I think our civilization is terminally ill when it is all right to show blood and brains flying all over (Repeatedly) but it is somehow wrong to show a healthy, happy girl's crotch, especially if she is having a nice healthy orgasm, with or without a partner! This film does not make sex look bad.  It makes the people doing it look bad! Cruel, self serving and stupid behavior is acted out throughout this film. It has always been my film going experience that some degree of sex has been allowed in a film as long as sex was depicted as some evil that resulted in the ruination of the participants.  This film is not only of the same ilk, it probably deserves some sort of award!\"Live long and prosper\" Spock, of the Enterprise",

            "content": "Boogie Nights opens with a shot that lasts for 2 minutes and 55 seconds. The words Boogie Nights appear on the screen, but within the universe of the film; the name of a nightclub, which the camera spins away from and onto the entrance of another nightclub. The camera snakes inside, following several primary characters interacting with each other, while patrons dance and drink, all soundtracked by a rocking 70's soul tune. What a way to start a film. Paul Thomas Anderson was only 26 when he made this.In fact, looking at the context of the writer-director's age, it's a ridiculously ambitious movie. We are thrown, for 148 relentless minutes, into the world of the 70's porn industry, a challenging topic to make into an accessible film; but Anderson succeeds with ease. We sympathise with these strange characters and their strangely innocent world, and with Mark Wahlberg's well-meaning and well-endowed Dirk Diggler. \"Dirk\", real name Eddie, is a lowly dishwasher at that nightclub in the first scene with a reputation for his gigantic member. Taken under the wing of Burt Reynolds' director, he grows to become a porn superstar. And then, just as Diggler's career hits its peak, it goes downhill as the 70's literally turns into the 80's. The fall side of this rise-and-fall plot is catalysed by, at a New Year 1980 party, one of the most shocking and brilliantly handled screen deaths I've ever seen. The film's second half is chaotic and messy, but feels intentionally so; the tight structure of the opening hour unravelling as the character's lives fall apart. I mentioned before the strange innocence of the porn industry. It's seen in the hilarious in-porn dialogue, in the Margherita-soaked parties, in Reynold's dream to be a real, artistically valid director making real art. As film gives way to video and that visual aesthetic is lost, we start to see the effects of drug abuse, of ego, of exploiting women, and of an industry that is dangerously linked to real crime. There is a violent scene in a donut shop that seems indulgent and pointless, and a subplot with Julianne Moore that doesn't really go anywhere. Some may feel that the running time is excessive, and they'd have a point; but I wasn't bored for a second. It's funny, shocking, sexy, ugly, and frightening at all the right moments. There's an obvious debt to Goodfellas in style, plot, and yes, the long shots; but it's never a pastiche or ripoff. That's partly because of Anderson's assured and confident direction, partly because California and porn offers such a nice contrast to New York and gangsters. John C Reilly and Philip Seymour Hoffman offer excellent supporting work, and the soundtrack is fantastic. Boogie Nights is vibrant, effortlessly entertaining and intelligently made cinema.",

Mainstream Hollywood movies could not show a man and a woman in bed together and if they did , both actors had to have one foot on the floor during the scene. The words such as \"Pregnant\" and words referring to a woman's breasts or a man's penis were never allowed so this film means Hollywood has moved farther OR sunken deeper in trying to find what the public wants to see and spend it's money on. Burt Reynolds was the first man to appear in a nude centerfold picture in the woman's PLAYGIRL magazine and played a woman chasing Senator in the movie STRIPTEASE, so he is right to play the Porno film director in this movie that tries to show the way pornographic films were made during the 1970's to 1980's. Mark Wahlberg(later in the Planet of the Apes remake?)plays the young stud that Burt finds to star next in his porno flicks.

The Movie becomes boring when the director fires(not exactly) the main character .. This was just something to increase the movie timings nothing else .. but its better to work on quality rather than quantityN one more thing ... i don't think the movie name goes with the movie , if it had been the adventures of Dirk Diggler something like that, it would have been great .. Now coming to the GOOD POINTS .. it was good combination of Exotic n Erotic Scenes .. a couple scenes were very good n its always good to watch celebrity sex ... kind of gets u turn ON .. Most importantly it tells the history of Porn industry , how the golden era of porn changed through 1980's .. n the introduction of sex videotapewell at the end i should tell u that i have gone too deep to provide my reviews n u may consider these flaws have been explained in to detail, so overall i consider it a good movie and a must watch moviei'll give it a 7.5/10 ..",

Some cannot remove themselves from moral constraints and objections over content. But to the viewer that either has none or is able to part with them 3 hours at a time, Boogie Nights is a redeeming film that goes beyond catchy soundtracks and tricky photography.  The ensemble of actors that populate this film, from a very competent Mark Whalberg to an extremely endearing and emotive Julienne Moore, mesh together and into their characters so well that after that immense first scene, you forget they're actors.  And that's the main allure of BN, Anderson's created a world so broad and aptly nihilistic that as a viewer, I found myself and those dear to me in nearly all the archetypal roles he's imagined.  Some will draw the obvious comparisons to Goodfellas, and they're well-founded.  However, after giving Boogie Nights a more detached viewing, I realized that this film goes beyond mere pining about money or respect.  It's family solidarity and the capacity to forgive that takes this movie over its three hour journey.  Score one for the Playstation generation, because, make no mistake, if I made a film with this kind of raw veracity and redemptive economy, I'd make PT Anderson seem bashful about his abilities.

Paul Thomas Anderson showed flashes of genius in his debut, Hard Eight, in 1996; and in 1997, he all but solidified his place in the Director's Hall of Fame.  Everything about \"Boogie Nights\" is pristine, from the 5 minute one-shot introductory scene, to Anderson's fluid camerawork, to the pinpointed details of a turbulent social era.  Mark Wahlberg is perfectly cast as Eddie Adams AKA Dirk Diggler, the boy wonder who makes a HUGE name for himself in the adult film world.  Julianne Moore and Burt Reynolds were properly praised for their career-making and reviving roles, respectively.  And the strong supporting cast of John C. Reilly, Heather Graham, Don Cheadle and William H Macy provide enough comic relief to make it through the 2 and a half hour epic.  The most impressive aspect of this late 90's classic (besides the terrific music) is that these pornographers/drug users/general lowlife actually warrant sympathy and even sometimes, love.  Anderson's amazing script makes you FEEL for these people like no other script could.(with this subject matter anyway)  WARNING: This movie's biggest knock is that it's far too long, but my tip is this....become a slave to Anderson's masterpiece, and you won't find a better two and a half hours you could spend.  Paul Thomas Anderson is the man to watch for the 21st Century, and with his new movie, Magnolia, slated for a late 1999 release; with all due respect Mr. Lucas, there is only ONE movie I will wait in line to see this year.",

Maybe you will too.My friend kept whispering to me after about 30 minutes how much he hated it. Despite this, I still really liked it.  To be sure, though, I went back to watch it a second time, this time on my own.  I liked it even better the second time.  Despite the large number of characters we are presented with, we are able to understand each of them, for better or worse.  The vast majority of the characters are sympathetic, which, in my mind, makes them all the more interesting.  The soundtrack is fantastic and embodies the period and the mood of the film.  The acting is superb.  Some of the actors give two performances.  Firstly, there is the 'off-camera' acting which presents the characters' actual lives.  Secondly, there is the 'on-camera' acting which, intentionally, is terrible.  To act as a character who acts poorly is much more difficult than you would expect.  The late British comedian, Les Dawson, had a recurring sketch where he would play a tune on the piano.  The joke lay in the fact that while we could understand what the tune was, it was played so badly that it was embarrassing.  Try playing a tune you know, well enough for it to be recognised but poorly enough for it to be amusing.  It's a difficult task.  It's the same with acting.The aspect of the film which most interested me however, was the direction and the camerawork.  There are numerous lengthy and interesting shots. The scene where the camera pans around a swimming pool, incorporating many different conversations before following someone into the pool (underwater) had me bouncing in my seat. It is, however, the opening shot which most impressed me.  A continuous tracking shot which lasts for around 3 minutes, which begins outdoors and about 20 feet high and ends indoors, having introduced us to the majority of the film's main characters.  For my money, this is one of the greatest shots in film history.  It's length, the amount of detail it contains and its relevance to the film as a whole is amazing. Arguably the best compliment that you could pay this film is that, despite the fantastic opening shot, the film does not disappoint from then until its closing credits.",

First, there is rarely making-out in porn because it is a personal act. Second, what the hell is this?! It's like what a 12 year old would imagine in his little immature mind to be a porn sex scene. Totally unreal. So is this the maturity level of the director, or is it that he could not convince big-movie-star Heather Graham to strip for more than a few seconds and only do the scene if Mark Wahlberg was fullyclothed. If that's all you have to work with, fine; find another way to make it feel genuine, find another cast, or don't do a movie about porn!Even worse, is the scene when Burt Reynolds and Heather Graham lure the fratboy into the limo to video tape anonymous porn. Things don't go as expected,and then they beat him up. The development of the scene and it's dialogue does not build to anger or frustration for the viewer. It just feels entirely random, like the director is just throwing behaviors and events out there with no explanation or emotional connection. The whole movie is a string of similarly surface- shocking, shallow scenes.I have the same complaint of nearly every \"intense\" scene in every PT Anderson film. How did this guy become acclaimed as an \"important\" film-maker? I admire him only because he goes out with Fiona Apple.Based on the all positive reviews of this 2.5 hour waste of dramatic time, I have to assume people are very wooed by the glitz of big actors and glamor of 70sporn. This stuff should be incidental as a setting, but instead it's the only thing the whole movie boils down to.",

Burt Reynolds was the caring father figure and Julianne Moore, frustrated by missing her biological son, became the mother to both Mark Wahlberg and Heather Graham. When Mark Wahlberg is introduced to the family, everyone is open and friendly and he quickly becomes the favorite child. But when he becomes jaded by easy praise and another \"new boy\" appears, he acts like a spoiled child who has been introduced to a new sibling. What sets him off is his \"mother\" Julianne Moore kneeling next to the new guy and talking to him. Anyway, they all support one another and hang out at parties together during the holidays (instead of Christmas parties, it's New Year's Eve parties). At the end, Heather Graham is actively calling Julianne Moore \"Mom\" and is back in school getting her GED and Mark Wahlberg is back in the bosom of his \"family\" because they always forgive you there. A beautiful film, tribute to one of the many alternative families out there. Music, lovingly orchestrated by Michael Penn (seen in cameo) is appropriate, moving the scenes effortlessly onward.",

Every time I watch this, I notice an actor that is now famous that wasn't famous the previous time I watched it...but I think I've now covered off all the main characters in the movie as they all seem to have gone on to bigger and better things; most notably, Julianne Moore, Heather Graham, Bill Macey, Tom Jane, Philip Seymour Hoffman, and of course Mark Whalberg and C. Thomas Reilley. A notable mention also to Don Cheedle who was just nominated for a Best Actor award at the 2005 Oscars. This guy is awesome and sooo cute in this movie!

The look is so gritty that you will find yourself glancing around the room, wondering where you are.I recommend this movie to people often, and they usually come back with that raised eyebrow look. This movie tells the truth and shows us things we don't want to see, both about ourselves and the world we live in. This is why, in my opinion, it is so disturbing to so many individuals. They want to escape, not be re-engulfed. The acting is top notch. All the characters remain believable at all times, and act as any normal person would act if they were them. They truly engulf themselves in the character, avoiding the typical unreal characters written into the script. Speaking of the script, it is amazing. I have unfortunately been unable to locate a copy of it... But after my ninth watching I began to feel it more and more. The dialogue is well written, and the scenes are well played out. The photography for this film is also amazing. The first shot alone left me in awe. I would begin to fall out of this trance, but then another scene would cruise by my eyes and return me to my previous state... Needless to say, I love this movie. The time and effort put into it is obvious. I believe that this was, hands down, the best movie of 1997.",

Rounding out the cast is the all-time great actor Burt Reynolds playing director Jack Warner with his sexy wife xxxxxxxxx played by the lovely red headed Julianne Moore. To sum everything up, Boogie Nights is a fun ,sexy ,and very entertaining movie. And the only reason I didn't give it five stars is I'm jealous of Mark wahlberg's amazingly large penis lol.

Didn't anyone want to get even a slight sneak peek  inside their lives? I know for sure many teens really wished to know how they live, as much as they wanted to see a movie about it. \"Boogie Nights\" starts off more of as a feel-good Saturday night movie for a one-time watch with your girlfriend or boyfriend, but, once it gets to the middle, everything literally changes. At some point you don't understand what's going on because of the amount of events that is happening, but once you finally start getting what's happening, you start feeling worried. You start to get the feeling of a person's life literally going from highest highs to lowest lows in just a matter of minutes. I adore this film a great much, because of how many controversial topics and problems it raises, which are still actual up to this day. Juliana Moore also looks stunning in the movie, as you get to live through her short, but really memorable role. Every single song that plays fits the theme well, every single side character is amazing in his or her own ways, as there was not a single moment, where I cringed from someone's performance. The dialogue is what makes this movie tense and what turns it into a drama-thriller and the ending is something that leaves you really shocked, but you will only get it once you will watch the movie, you'll see what I am talking about.  The setting is very well picked: every single party feels like an actual party, every single \"film\" made feels like if it is actually being filmed. This movie just takes the idea of a life of adult movie star's life falling down and just takes everything it can out of it. This is a real must watch, but of course, if you are mature enough. A lot of scenes require somewhat preparation, as it is not an easy movie to watch. \nStrong 9/10, the best ever Mark Wahlberg's role and a breath taking plot.",

There are a lot of great actors in this movie who are old today so its fun to see them so young in their careers, back in the 70's. I can't remember them all but you got Don Cheadle, Marky Mark, John C. Reilly, Willam H Macy, Heather Graham, Burt Reynolds, Julianne Moore, and Mark Wahlburg (and Julianne more ON Mark Wahlburg). In that scene where Clarice and Marky Mark do it the first time, she was sure feeling those \"good vibrations.\" It was really cool and surprising how they set up the 2004 Punisher movie and Spiderman 2 because you see the Punisher (again played by Tom Jane) undercover and trying to bust Doc Ock, who is in his crazy college days as a maniacal coke dealer. Also, it is cool that Marky Mark and Dr. Steve Brule could both be in a movie WITHOUT Will Ferrel, 'cause back then, he was just a guy on SNL and not a movie star. He's also not much of a star now, if you have read my reviews of Eurovision and Downhill, they fucking sucked. Heather Gram was looking mighty cute as Roller Girl, but I do wonder if she ever took her skates off for a shower / wash / powdering. It could get kinda nasty if she never takes them off, and it's dangerous if you're skating around the pool or a BBQ or in the kitchen. Safety first, but this was the 70s, so you don't see a lot of safe sex in the movie. Especially the first time Clarice and Marky Mark do it. So suspend your disbelief for these small fantastical touches since they heighten the drama and give more character to the film. This one's for the ladies because you see Marky Mark at his prime and hanging dong. He's not always on top as Dirk Diggler though, and its this journey of highs and lows, set against the immersive retro backdrops that take you back in time and to the gentle heart that makes this film such a winner. The real message about movies whether they're pornos or Disneys is that they don't make 'em like they used 2!!!",

With Reynolds, Moore, Wahlberg, Reilly, and Cheadle each providing wonderful acting quality, and even smaller roles filled up with some legitimately top-tier supporting cast members in Macy and Hoffman. The storytelling is of such quality that the film can wander in and out of subplots with ease, completely independent of the time previously ascribed to them (Cheadle in particular seems almost separate from the remainder of the film on the whole, but it doesn't necessarily seem out of place). The narrative twists and familiarity with violence seem to bring Tarantino to mind; the cinematography and score are both top-notch. But sewing it all together with such a commercial and unvarnished look at sex is where the real innovation and shock lies. (4.5/5)",

Mark Whalburg shines here as Eddie \"Dirk Digler,\" Adams a dropout who lives in a shitty home with an abusive mom. He has no brain or any normal aspirations but against all odds he meets a top porn producer and finds his way into the porn industry where becomes the top dog. Along the way he bangs a lot of women and wins a ton of awards but also gets addicted to coke and his life comes falling appart. \n\nWhat makes this unique is the effort in giving the side characthers their own arcs. Burt Reynolds gives the best performance of his career as the porn producer in which he got an Oscar nom, he's really really good in this and def earned it. You also get great performances from Julliane Moore and Heather Graham as the porn babes, and you have William H Macy, Don Cheadle, and Phillip Seymour Hoffman as the tech guys who have their time to shine. Macy has a lot of heavy dramatic scenes and does excellent. Cheadle has a lot in the 2nd half and ends up the most likeable character in the piece.\n\nThe third act's really really out there but it ends a fun ride.  As a time period film it demonstrates it well but there were a few missed opportunities character arc wise that just made it a little from perfect for me. Still a very solid film none the less.",

He also got the best out of his actors, because some talented people give some of their top performances ever. Mark Wahlberg (Eddie/Dirk) is strong, while Burt Reynolds (Jack Horner) and Julianne Moore (Maggie/Amber) seem to steal the show. John C. Reilly (Reed) is really funny, while Heather Graham (Brandy/Rollergirl) is possibly at her best. The soundtrack is extremely fitting. I also must commend all the behind the scenes people, as the sets and costumes are easily some of the best things about this movie. Don Cheadle (Buck) was also quite good, as were Phillip Seymour Hoffman (Scotty J.) and William H. Macy (Bill). Lastly, it's quite interesting to see the toll the porn industry takes on the lives of the people involved.\n\nWeaknesses: It's egregiously long. There's no need for this movie to go for two and a half hours. You really feel it as it nears the third act. While the story is good, I don't think it ever quite touches great territory. There are several side plots that feel like they're a bit extra. I understand what the Bill storyline was meant to showcase, but it wasn't needed. Even Buck, who was a fun character, felt off to the side a bit. As good as Anderson was as the director, a few of his shot choices were odd. There were moments when the camera lingered on seemingly unimportant things. Also, while all the characters were fully developed, I didn't feel a need to root for many of them in most situations.\n\nOverall: People hold this movie in very high esteem. It's good, but I wouldn't consider it a classic or anything like that. The running time is a real problem, damaging the overall enjoyment of this film. If it was closer to two hours, it would've worked better.",

Whilst 'Magnolia' is undoubtedly his masterpiece; one which I doubt he'll ever beat, movies like 'Boogie Nights' show him in his unrefined, yet most daring stage. Although this movie is way too long, and feels rather messy in its construction, it also demonstrates some of Anderson's most experimental work. The fluid camera movements, the excellent soundtrack, all backed up with some fantastic performances meant this was one hell of an entertaining ride. You feel the length (no pun intended), and it sometimes feels a little meandering in its plotting, but at the same time it manages to sweep you up into the chaos of this world.

We experience his highs & lows as well as that of everyone else as they struggle with their personal relationships, drug use and their place in a changing industry as the \"art-form\" essentially goes from classical music to dubstep.\n\nFeaturing a deep ensemble of characters that are all complex and well-developed, Boogie Nights weaves multiple story arcs seamlessly and uses contemporary music from the era to perfectly set the tone for each scene. As Eddie says in the beginning, \"Everyone's blessed with one special thing\", but this movie has everything going for it.

It manages to cover a lot of different moods and tones without feeling scattered, and the soundtrack feels intoxicatingly upbeat. The story is phenomenal, and P. T Anderson's imagination seems to have been non-stop when it came to the events and situations the characters find themselves in. But, as with most of the writer/director's films, the characters are the biggest source of intrigue here. As I mentioned before, they're all really dumb. Some more than others, but they're all quite dumb. But they're also passionate and have an obvious desire to love someone or something, and it makes them sympathetic and engaging to watch on screen. The performances here are nothing short of fantastic. The film also portrays the passages of the decade or so it takes place over with an extreme attention to detail. It's very believable, and incredibly atmospheric. It's not hard to understand why \"Boogie Nights\" is a classic. It's an absolute masterpiece.",

The second hour is arguably another genre, radically turning on us as the consequences of falling from a peak are met.\r\n\r\nMark Wahlberg is sensational; incredibly focused, vivid in his portrayal, consistent to the attitudes of the story, but always entertaining.  He gives the fight with his mom a comical twist that could hardly be given any direction beyond what the performance must intuitively know in order to get that idea across; he's determinedly present.  In the faux coke-dealing scene at Rahad's (Alfred Molina), there's this hopeless gaze that comes over his face as he realizes the impasse of his circumstance, which we all feel as an audience; the situation is absurd, and the odds of escape don't look good.  Look at his eyes, they numb over, each moving off in different directions - I'd imagine that could only happen to a person caught in such a situation in real life, but to act this seems impossible.  He also develops a strong independent activity in the form of a few karate moves that thread him through key points of the picture, including a hilarious award ceremony, and a brilliant homage to Raging Bull's ending in front of the mirror.  Watching Eddie develop as Dirk Diggler, one gets the sense that as we are all truly born to do something in life, most definitely Eddie is a pornographic godsend.\r\n\r\nI love that this giant 13\" protrusion in Dirk's pants is left to the imagination until the very end of the picture.  My compliments to the whole third act finale, which neatly tied up everyone's story in a way that so many films frustratingly leave unresolved.  It's really perfect, and a nice little comeback from some pretty awful circumstances.  It makes the film less judgmental, that we could get behind these characters and actually see them end up okay, a nice little family.\r\n\r\nAnderson's staging is amongst the best in the history of the craft, with long camera moves, but no wasted space between tracking/dolly moves, quickly picking up the action of the next set of characters, getting into their vibe, their story, and getting a sense of how interconnected everybody is.\r\n\r\nWhat an amazing cast all around.  Don Cheadle as Buck Swope achieves a total presence through the relation of his various appearances, the 80s New Years party Rick James look being my favorite.  This is when everything is budding for changes, including Buck and the girl who will eventually be by his side - they are losing interest in this business and want to do something more legitimate.  A new mustached character is introduced, one who will lead Dirk and Reed down a dark, godforsaken path.  And then there's the culmination of Little Bill's (William H Macy) crisis with his cuckolding wife, which perfectly transitions us into the next phase of the film.",

It features (mostly) great performances from its fairly large cast and fantastic direction from one of the greatest living filmmakers and one of the greatest American filmmakers to ever live. The only downside to how it was directed, and a general problem with a lot of PTA's work, is that lengthy dialogue sequences aren't shot too dynamically. A lot of it is simply shot/reverse shot close-ups. Sometimes this works really well when you have a great actor and a great script (as is the case with Mr. Anderson's masterpiece There WIll Be Blood), and although the script was not bad by any means, it really lacked something that made listening to these people talk a bit trying at times. Perhaps it felt repetitive, I'd probably have to re-watch it to determine exactly why. I was really interested to see how Paul Thomas Anderson would tackle a subject like the 70's porn industry, but he's a man who can make anything fascinating. The movie is (mostly) rife with humor that pokes fun at its subject and is always entertaining. I'll admit my mind started to wander from the movie during the last half hour, although it wasn't dull in any way. This is a movie that has a large cast of characters, which can sometimes really hinder a movie, but PTA pulls it off so well (mostly with the brilliant opening shot of the movie). However, the greatest pitfall of this movie is none other than it's lead: Marky Mark. I know it is an unpopular opinion, but I think Mark Wahlberg just isn't a good actor. He just didn't convince me in this movie. I just see Mark Wahlberg in every movie he's in, he's never his character. However, everyone else is great.

Giving up the cherished virtue of intimacy is no problem - we'd be doing it anyway, they tell themselves as they slowly but surely get asphyxiated by the deluge of sleaze that takes over their lives.\n\tOne such individual is Eddie Adams (Mark Wahlberg), a high-school dropout who works as a nightclub busboy while his alcoholic mother (Joanna Gleason) berates him for being a loser without a future.  So he considers himself lucky when he's noticed by porn producer Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds, giving one of his finest performances) and is taken to San Fernando Valley to begin a quick-footed career.  With his youthful wiliness acting as a front for his well-endowed persona, he becomes an instant sensation, going by the glorious stage name \"Dirk Diggler\" in the process.\n\tLike regular fame of the Old Hollywood sort, Eddie is enchanted by his newfound life: drugs are at his beck-and-call, women kiss the floor he walks on, and he, only a few months into his crude career, is labeled as a star comparable to John Holmes, winning more Adult Film Awards than anyone else in the industry.  \n\tBut to live under such a filthy psychological roof can only do harm - termites have to come around sooner or later - and Eddie, despite his original satisfaction, finds himself continually disjointed from reality, the drugs soon becoming too much, the women too much, the attention too much.  It isn't long before \"Boogie Nights\" begins to turn into \"The Rise and Fall of Dirk Diggler\"; if it weren't for the happy-ish ending, maybe that title would have stuck.\n\tA film with the plot of \"Boogie Nights\" might sound vulgar, but, as the second film of the now sought-after Paul Thomas Anderson, it is anything but: it's a character study comparable to the fast moving epicness of Altman's \"Short Cuts\" or Tarantino's \"Jackie Brown\".  It travels quickly from black comedy to drama to black comedy over and over again, looking at the porn industry through both a satirical light and a deeply serious one.  We can laugh-and-point all we want at its fixtures' self-important realities, believing that having sex for a living is really a talent; but we can also look in horror as their world soon evaporates as their cocaine adoration becomes a problem, as arousal is no longer much of a possibility, as the mere dropping of their real name is able to destroy what they've come to know about themselves.\n\tAnderson's direction and writing is so monumental because it is able to find the humor and the darkness in the grimy situation, all the while maintaining a nonjudgmental handle on the icky setting.  He doesn't see his characters as objects like the people watching a porn film do - he rather looks at them as desperate people who acted hastily in their youth and are forced to endure a lifetime of pain for that initial agreement.  Whether they choose to become a porn mainstay or a porn drop-by is up to them, but the decision to appear in the first place will haunt them for the rest of their lives.\n\tWe see this as Eddie loses his place as the 1980s make their way into porn and he dissolves into piles of drugs, as the maternal Amber Waves (a terrific Julianne Moore) finds herself in the midst of a custody battle as her past marriage catches up to her sordid present, as the doe-eyed Rollergirl (Heather Graham) eventually realizes that dropping out of high school wasn't such a good idea after all.  Most heartbreaking is when Buck Swope (Don Cheadle), pregnant wife in hand, leaves porn and decides to start a business; but as he's asking for a loan, he is denied the money because of his long-ago mistakes.\n\t\"Boogie Nights\" seems to climax left and right as reality soon sets in; it's so brilliant because it experiences life through Eddie's youthful eyes, originally unassuming and finally, damaged.  The film is initially warm, inviting, and sun-soaked - but every single day afterward, the industry loses the honeymoon magic of its first few days.  Anderson's lightly maintained satirical eye during the first act of the film is notably luminous, and as he descends into off-kilter grit later grit, it feels like a natural progression.  The bold first ending (aka the wake-up call of Dirk Diggler), which sees the protagonist and a couple other coke-headed losers attempt to swindle a playboy out of $5,000 for coke (which is actually baking soda), is unpredictable and explosive, matching the capricious fickleness of the rest of \"Boogie Nights\".  It pools together every mood Anderson introduces us to during its 155 minutes.\n\tTake away the porn angle, and \"Boogie Nights\" would still be a standout ensemble character study.  Anderson doesn't rely on the gimmick of onscreen faux intimacy - he is more interested in the effect that it has on the people who devote their lives to giving a physical connection up for money.  An early, funny scene, where Eddie makes his debut alongside Amber, is just as sad as it is funny: between takes, Amber coos compliments to him like she's his mother, as if she's praising him for a soccer win, an academic triumph.  It's funny because audiences see the scene as sexy, the performers as a job, and we, as voyeurs, guffaw at the sheer fakery of porn.  What's sad, though, is that the performers don't see the toll committing such acts will have on them in the future, that audiences think that what they see on screen is real.  Thankfully, the world Anderson concocts makes \"Boogie Nights\" the furthest thing from cheap.  It's the real deal.",

His sprawling epic about the rise-and-fall of a skin-flick entourage is explored in intimate detail in this star-studded homage to the success and excesses of the '70s porn industry. Anderson does nothing to tame the subject matter for the big screen, but he doesn't fall back on shock value to keep you titillated (sorry again.) The two-and-a-half hour runtime is used to paint a mosaic, building up the characters involved, making their relationships the primary narrative drive, making Boogie Nights more a film about family than boning on celluloid. And if that doesn't put you in the mood (last one, I promise), you can revel in the stylistic flair Anderson brings in the form of intricately engineered tracking shots, lascivious color, and more camera trickery than you can shake an 8track at. Cinematic and torrid in equal measure, by pretty much any measure this is all the film you could reasonably want or need",

The story is very well-engineered, with driving plot twists that keep the story going, and there's plenty of room for real character development. Of all the films that are set in the 1970's but were released after that decade, this film manages to recreate the 70's beyond the usual style and music. It recreates the distinct glamour of the 70's, but it also recreates the highs and lows, along with the carefree ethos and mentality of the people in it. They do just as good a job at establishing the right mood. The first half of the movie is presented with ecstatic highs, while the second half, which is set in the early 80's, is presented as the point where everything starts coming down.

I mean it's not like it was shown that they all had some revelation, right? They just went from the bottom to the complete opposite in a matter of minutes! Unfortunately My friends, that's just called lazy writing. Plus, Diggler was just shown to go back to his life of porn, but isn't that kind of the thing that messed him up in the first place? Was it trying to say that he's an idiot that didn't learn anything from his experiences? I don't know, but either way it was disappointing. \nDespite my rambling criticism, it wasn't all bad, I mean I have given it 3 stars. I really liked how it showed the changing attitudes to porn as time went on, the directing was fairly good, as was the acting, and despite all its flaws it was an entertaining film to watch with its multiple character backgrounds; although it seemed like some of them weren't quite finished...\nMaybe I should let PTA off and use the excuse that he was a young director/writer at the time, but i think i preferred his first movie, Hard Eight, to this.

Anderson's use of longer scenes and longer takes doesn't let the characters escape the viewer and given the world it portrays, they kind of mirror the way they are used in the porn industry, as shown in the film. The soundtrack is a little crowded with perhaps too much music, but some songs really hit the spot. All in all, it's recommended, because the talent on display is just to good to ignore.",

            "content": "Well, Philip Seymour Hoffman just died, so much like I did with Peter O' Toole, I'm going to write a review of one of his movies (even though he's no more than a bit part in it). What's weird is that I just watched Boogie Nights for the first time last night, and then I woke up this morning to find out that Hoffman is dead. Huh. Maybe the next movie on my itinerary should be Justin Bieber's Never Say Never. Anyway, Hoffman was a great actor who starred in both some of my favorite (The Big Lebowski) and some of my least favorite (The Master) films of all time, but the consistent high point in even his worst films were his performances, which had depth and range. He will be missed.\r\n\r\nSo: Boogie Nights. Directed by Paul Thomas Anderson (who also did The Master, by the way), this film is an intense and graphic showcasing of Hollywood life in the 1970s-- specifically the porn industry. It stars Mark Wahlberg as an up-and-coming (no pun intended) porn star named Dirk Diggler and Burt Reynolds as the director who \"discovered\" him. Interestingly enough, Reynold's character is a terrible director who makes shit for a living, and is still a pretentious ass about it... which is exactly what PTA became in his later years. Oh, the irony. Anyway, although this movie does lack the air of self-importance and arrogance that has plagued PTA's recent movies, it does lack something that the others do: A frickin' story.\r\n\r\nBoogie Nights showcases a slice of Americana that is a good chunk of why other countries hate us so much. And no, I'm not talking about porn (that's part of it though), I'm talking about the 1970s. Anderson takes great lengths to recreate the air of decadence, amoralism, and seediness that plagued that decade, but he doesn't actually build a story around it. Wahlberg's character is a whiny little bitch who doesn't really connect with the audience in any way (his defining feature is his apparently 13-inch penis, so yeah, don't watch this movie if you're not prepared for that), and he never really does anything throughout the course of the film. One would think that a movie about such a subject would finish off with its characters in a spiral into darkness, a tragedy like Requiem for a Dream or The Fly. But for some reason, Boogie Nights concludes its tale of filth with a fairytale ending: Wahlberg pulls his life out of the gutter, Reynolds returns to making movies, and the audience wonders if this couldn't have been accomplished in less than two and a half hours. Why would you end a movie like this on such a high note? It almost justifies what the people in it are doing. Not that I'm looking for some sort of hellish, morbid conclusion to it all, but there has to be some reason for why I just sat through the film.\r\n\r\nStill, I can't entirely write off Boogie Nights, as Anderson's direction is admittedly quite vibrant, and the characters and dialogue are spectacular. It creates a Pulp Fiction-y vibe, and although it's not quite capable of reaching the pure and unbridled insanity that is a Quentin Tarantino movie, it still impresses. Wahlberg, who isn't a very good actor, is given a lot to work with here, and even though his character often comes off as annoying, you still want him to make it to the end of the film. With a supporting cast that includes Hoffman, Julianne Moore, John C Reilly, Don Cheadle, and Heather Graham as the unnamed \"Rollergirl,\" there's really not a high probability that this would have been bad. Even though the runtime could have easily been trimmed down a bit, I can't seem to pinpoint many scenes that I would edit out. This dark comedy only really works when all of its randomness is joined together in one glorious amalgam of sex, drugs, and chaos. For better or for worse, it's one of the most demented movies out there.\r\n\r\nFinal Score for Boogie Nights: 7/10 stars. I really wanted to like this movie more, as everyone calls it PTA's best film, but I honestly couldn't get as into it as I should have been. The ending really killed it, but there is no heart to this movie in general, and much like The Wolf of Wall Street, its emptiness cannot be combated by the cheap thrills it delivers. Maybe if it had had a more charismatic lead actor, playing a more sympathetic character, it would have been better. But it settles for being a slightly above-average movie about porn and drugs... in which nobody actually says the word \"porn.\" Also, did we really need to see Wahlberg's penis at the end? I'm not a prude (although it was gross), but it kind of destroys the illusion of the movie. Much like Steven Spielberg revealing the aliens at the end of Close Encounters, it doesn't leave anything to the audience's imagination. And that's not something movies should do.",

Everyone's born with one special thing, and Eddie Adams (Marc Wahlberg) uses his \"special gift\" and is poised to take the world of porn by storm. Eddie Adams, (also known as Dirk Diggler), is discovered by porn director Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds) and soars to the top of the pornography industry. After achieving great success in the industry during the 1970's, the 80's did not fair so well for Dirk. A change of culture coupled with a drug addiction, he quickly hits rock bottom not knowing anything else to turn to.

It's a movie more than the usual life of the party story in which fun and drugs ensue. It tells its story with fascinating characters, including an absolute standout lead by Mark Whalberg. But what makes this movie stand out is Anderson's style and technique on how he tells this story and never loses your attention. The situations feel grounded in reality that we can identify with the characters and the struggles they go through. It does not just show the fun to be had behind the porn industry, but the dark side as well. The transformation in structure is done so beautifully that it stands out from other movies that take on this similar formula. Overall, \"Boogie Nights\" is a standout thanks to its excellent style, storytelling and performances (even if it hits familiar beats.) I give this an A!",

The scenes between Wahlberg and Reilly's characters are among the most memorable in any Anderson film. There is a lot more humor from scene to scene than in most Anderson films, ironically that may be why I didn't connect with these characters as well as would have liked. The scene where Diggler and the boys go to a drug dealers house to rip him off best illustrates this. This is a scene that is ultimately where the protagonist of the movie hits rock bottom, but instead of feeling that emotion, I was laughing and shaking my head in disbelief. Don't misunderstand, I enjoyed this scene, and I think Anderson wanted us to see the absurdity. However instead of connecting with these characters as I have in other Anderson films, these moments disconnect me. For me moments like this are what takes this film from being great to just another good movie.",

During the late '70s, a small cadre of directors believed that they could combine the raunch of real sex with an involving plot. It was a lofty goal, and one that ultimately proved impossible to realize, especially with the advent of video forcing movies to be made cheaper and faster. In his new film, Boogie Nights, writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson takes us back to the disco era, and, by following a small group of characters, recreates the rise and fall of \"artistic porn\" and those who participated in it.\r But Boogie Nights isn't just an expose of the porn industry -- it's a provocative and involving character study, as well. While it could be argued that Anderson has bitten off more than he can chew -- a few too many of the men and women populating his film are left half-developed -- an overambitious approach is always preferable to the alternative, and Boogie Nights does enough things right that it's easy to overlook its few shortcomings.\r One of the movie's greatest, and most immediately obvious, assets is its ability to capture the feel and mood of the late '70s and early '80s. At different times throughout the film, Anderson uses long, single takes where the camera pans from one character to another, putting the viewer in the midst of a swirl of activity. The director also has a talent for picking just the right songs for each scene, making the soundtrack an integral part of the movie rather than just a jumbled collection of old disco hits. Add to that the hairdos, clothing, decor, and attitudes of the era, and you have an effective re-creation of recent history. And, unlike The Ice Storm, which transpires in '70s suburbia, Boogie Nights is set in the sleazy heart of Los Angeles' drug-and-sex industry.\r Anderson also does a wonderful job of delineating the differences between the late '70s and the early '80s. The first half of the film, which takes place between 1977 and late 1979, is lively and energetic, with the focus on parties and good times. Then, following a pivotal sequence at a 1979/80 New Year's Eve gathering, Boogie Nights' tone shifts to something more grim and contentious. The porn industry goes into a downward spiral with mass-market video supplanting carefully-made movies, and the actors and directors are sucked down with it. Drugs and death run rampant. No one dies during the movie's first half (although there is a drug overdose), but the final hour features a body count.\r At Boogie Nights' center is Eddie Adams (Mark Wahlberg), a waiter at a San Fernando Valley night club who is \"discovered\" by idealistic porn movie producer/director Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds). Jack's dream is to make a movie that is \"true, and right, and dramatic,\" and his vision excites Eddie, who changes his name to Dirk Diggler and quickly becomes the hottest young stud in the industry. Together, the director and his star seek to elevate the Adult Film to the next level (which actually resembles a cheap exploitation action flick).\r Although Mark Wahlberg has the starring role, and gives the best performance of his career (although there are still times when he is stiff), he is easily overshadowed by two more impressive portrayals. Burt Reynolds, doing his best motion picture work in recent memory, develops Jack into a three-dimensional individual who really believes in his job until disillusionment hits. Matching Reynolds' performance step-by-step is Julianne Moore, who can add her role in Boogie Nights to an ever-increasing list of interesting and challenging characters. Meanwhile, Heather Graham, Don Cheadle, and William H. Macy are impressive in smaller parts (all of them deserve more screen time). And porn icon Nina Hartley gets some mainstream exposure, and even a few lines, as Little Bill's wife.\r Boogie Nights is filled with so many subplots and secondary themes that it would be impossible to recount them all here. Some of the most obvious involve the allure of stardom and the price certain individuals are willing to pay to attain it, the difficulty of \"rehabilitating\" one's name after being associated with something as \"damaging\" as the porn industry, and the inner need to belong. All of the men and women populating Boogie Nights encounter at least one of these elements as they traverse their character arc.\r With Boogie Nights, Anderson has realized the potential he showed in his previous feature, Hard 8 (which featured John C. Reilly and Philip Baker Hall, two members of this movie's ensemble cast). Boogie Nights is a dramatically rich and visually arresting motion picture that has earned (and is deserving of) comparisons to the films of Robert Altman. The result is a memorably penetrating motion picture.",

Riley) a Porn Actor with a unique taste in Magic, Buck Swope (Don Cheadle) a Porn Actor who is extremely knowledgable on stereo systems and is keen to run a buisness based on them, Scotty J. (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) a Gay boom operator who immediately falls for Eddie, \"Little\" Bill Thompson (William H. Macy) whose wife (real-life porn Actress Nina Hartley) constanly embarasses him by having sex with other men in movies and public, them and many other colourful characters.\r Eddie becomes acquainted to all of these quirky, likable characters and joins the industry under the name \"he sees in bright, blue neon lights\" Dirk Diggler, And becomes the industries hottest thing.\r Eventually Drugs kick in, the 80's is approaching and everyone goes there seperate ways, Dirk hits rock-bottom countless times, Bill shoots his wife them himself, Julianne Moore fails again to legally see her kids, Buck fails to get a loan. in a nutshell everything get's to their individual heads and ultimately it destroys them.\r Eventually though everything works out, in both unhappy and happy ways, Dirk reconciles with Jack, Rollergirl continues education, Buck uses stolen money to fund his buisness and aid his pregnant wife, Reed becomes a magician in a Nightclub. Essentially everything is back uder Jack Horner's control.\r Paul Thomas Anderson has made a film that is not solely based on Pornography, but based around the Actors and behind the scenes of it all, inspired by watching 70's porn flicks and enjoying the cheesy stories and setups which would eventually be missing from the 80's ones. he wrote \"The Dirk Diggler story\" a 30 min tribute flick about a fictional porn star.\rObviously sometime later he managed to build this wonderpiece around that original idea.\r Boogie Nights is an Essential PTA movie, everything he does has always had character development in mind, and in all honesty with this film he's not asking you to engage the characters or Pornography, but rather watch and identify the individualism of the real people behing the fictional Camera.\r Aside from that everyone is wonderful, Burt Reynolds steals the show as the always laid back director, Mark Wahlberg's insecurities give him alot to work with and he does well,\rEveryone in their own right in this movie, actors and characters are all perfect.\r Final Verdict: Sit down and Enjoy, Great casting, An Excellent screenplay, Sharp directing and of course one of the 90's best hits.",

Thanks to the great direction and writing from Paul Thomas Anderson, Boogie Nights may have subjective subject matter, but uses that solely as a springboard into the lives of dark, troubled people who are actually incredibly sympathetic, believable, and relatable. In a sign of things to come, the film uses an ensemble cast to great effect with phenomenal performances from Mark Wahlberg, Burt Reynolds, Julianne Moore, Heather Graham, Philip Seymour Hoffman, John C.

Burt Reynolds is phenomenal as the director Jack Horner and the rest o the performances are all interesting and show the actors and actresses as people, not objects. One other thing about \"Boogie Nights\" is how it effortlessly brings together humor, drama, and action. Julianne Moore's custody battle for her child is a particularly heart-wrenching scene; while the pool scenes bring in more comedic elements. However, Boogie Nights does have a few shortcomings. The entire second half of the movie teeters on being melodramatic and gets rid of the likability of some of the characters. I understand that it is meant to show what fame does to people but to me it wasn't the right direction for the movie to take. Also, a few scenes such as the scene at the drug dealer's house were out of character and were more upsetting then integral to the plot. Despite these shortcomings \"Boogie Nights\" is an excellent movie by an excellent director.",

Paul Thomas Anderson has its name written all over the frame that is perfectly balanced on this character and plot driven feature where if not for his execution, it would have been difficult to pull off such a powerful script. Mark Wahlberg is brilliant in his portrayal and is supported well enough by a great cast like Julianne Moore, William H. Macy and Heather Graham. Boogie Nights not only has enough content to feed the audience but is celebrated with a great conviction with the help of stellar performances, amazing background score and explicit editing and execution.",

All the negative reviewers all seem to either have an agenda, or aren\u2019t mature enough to accept the subject matter of the film. The negate reviewers are turning a blind eye, to all the fantastic performances by the whole cast, the incredible writing throughout the film, And of course absolutely jaw dropping cinematography, camerawork and editing which is some of the best of all time. The music and score is great,  the production design and costume design is exceptional. Anyone giving it lower than an 8 went it in with their mind made up as they were offended by the subject matter.",

A clever analogy for the beauty, innocence and art of cinema and celluloid, being replaced by cheap and nasty mass-produced video, made solely for profit and entertainment.What's interesting is how PTA is able the make such a sleazy and immoral environment seem so fun and innocent, within the first act. When the 80's arrive and everything takes a turn for the worst, the writing lost its way and Boogie Nights becomes a bit of a mess (I thought the same of Magnolia). We lose touch with the central characters and Wahlberg (who is great in the 1st half) doesn't have the chops to play the latter stages of his character's demise. The character/scene's which made the greatest impression were with Eric and his mother,  based on PTA's own mother.Bogie Nights is still a great achievement, especially considering PTA was only 27 when he made it.",
