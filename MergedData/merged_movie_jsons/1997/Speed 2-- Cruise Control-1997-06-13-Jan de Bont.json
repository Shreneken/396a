            "content": "Now I liked Sandra Bullock in the original Speed. I even liked her in that film where she went into a beauty pageant. But in this monstrosity, I just wanted to slap her repeatedly and say \"What are you doing!?\"She is just dire. Not in acting (well... any more than usual, anyway) but just in the way her character made you want to shake her until she regained some sense. Whoever was responsible for the script needs a good beating here. Unless I am completely mistaken, her character between the events of the first film and this one, turned into a complete and total airhead bimbo.Add in Jason Patric (who will never be leading man material) and it seems that only Willem Dafoe was having any fun. Truly awful!But it is good to see that ocean liners, which may have to weather tropical storms, apparently have windows made of glass so easy to break that anyone can hurl themselves through them on a whim. Priceless cinema.Avoid this one if you liked the original.Avoid this one if you expect a thrilling sea drama.Avoid this one if you like Sandra Bullock.Avoid this one if....well....just avoid it.",

            "content": "I was so curious as to what they would do in the sequel of Speed, I just watched Speed today and absolutely loved it! So, I can understand why Keanu turned down the movie, first off not only the script was bad, but the coincidences were beyond ridiculous of Sandra Bullock being in the same position twice and Jason Patrick?! He was so scared of doing a great movie like The Lost Boys, but yet he couldn't hesitate to do this movie? The movie just lost it's course and didn't work on any level, if it had different characters, maybe, but these great actors should know better and check twice before signing onto these sequels.Annie is with this new policeman, Alex, and he surprises her with cruise tickets. He is planning on asking her to marry him, but that is shortly interrupted when Willaim Defoe is now the super duper bad guy. He is upset that he designed the ships computer system but gets no credit, so guess what? He decides the best way to avenge this is to blow it up! But with Alex on board... yup... you guessed it, he's gonna stop William and save the day! Good for him! Speed 2: Cruise Control was just a money maker that is truly a fake movie that was really sad. The acting was really bad and Sandra's character went from admirable to just plain annoying. Alex had no character or any sympathy. The explosions were lame and the plot was just beyond unbelievable, poor William, he was probably on medication when he said yes to making this movie. Well, just please stay away from this movie, it'll be a waste of your time.2/10",

            "content": "\"Speed\" was a surprise hit movie. While it cost about $30,000,000 to make, it made back more than four times the cost. So, some Hollywood executives (with a collective IQ similar to that of a gerbil) thought...'if we do a sequel, we must spend $120,000,000 on it because THAT is why the first movie was such a success'. Not surprisingly, the movie tanked and it somehow has made it to IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 list--the 100 worst ranked major releases of all time.In the original, Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock work to prevent a bus from exploding and killing folks. Now, because this is an overbloated sequel, they've placed the story aboard a cruise ship...which is also out of control and will kill everyone unless our heroes save it....though this time Reeves refused to reprise his role. So, they cast the rather bland Jason Patric in the lead...who offered little improvement other than he was very good at using sign language in one small scene.How bad is this film? Well, not bad enough to be on the Bottom 100 list. So why is it on the list? After loving the first film, so many folks expected more of the same...and got nothing but a dull overblown action picture with little in the way to interest viewers....and I think THAT is why it made the list....because it disappointed so badly. Instead, I wish IMDB had a list for films with the worst ratio of cost to enjoyability of the film...in which case \"Speed 2\" would easily make the top 100.By the way, this sequel ended up spending nearly as much for ONE crash scene as the budget for all of \"Speed\"! And, after paying $11,500,000 just to obtain Sandra Bullock for this film, you can only assume that the film simply had nothing left to pay competent writers. Instead, I assume, they hired some penguins to write the script....some very, very dull and untalented penguins!",

            "content": "Having long since broken things off with her boyfriend, Annie and her new beau plan a romantic holiday on an ocean liner.  When onboard a disgruntled ex-employee of the liner disables the computer controls and sets it on a collision course while he escapes with his goods.  Alex has to take him on and try to stop the ship as it `races' out of control.As if Twister hadn't done it already, Speed 2 basically showed us that the potential that was shown by De Bont's debut was clearly misplaced and he has yet to show he was really anything other than in the right place at the right time when it came to Speed.  The smell of desperation is in the air from the very start when Reeves declined to star, although Bullock was more desperate and did it.  This caused Annie to repeatedly state that `relationships built on etc etc never work out', all in an effort to explain it away and help the audience move on.  That the film is constantly harking back to a much better film is a big problem, it would almost have been smarter just to move totally away than to retread.The plot is plain silly and never gets close to being involving.  To demonstrate this, I never once gave a rats' ass what was happening - people got crushed by the boat and mangled in it's propellers (unseen) but the film (or me) never care and never lingers.  Likewise the supposed big climax is unengaging and smacks of desperation - bang for buck and all that.  The whole set up never really feels immediate or threatening, even when the boat swings out of control it is difficult to feel terrified as the boat slooooowly goes towards the tanker, worst come to worst people can jump off to safety.  The cruiser setting also is daft when seen beside the bus concept - the vast majority of the audience will ride a bus quite often, very few of us can relate to an ocean liner!  The speed is a problem and it is almost laughable it works so poorly!The cast is another problem.  Bullock tries to repeat her sparky performance from the first film - when she manages it, it only feels like an impression, when she doesn't manage it she is cast as a shrieking beauty needing saving. However she also struggles from a lack of chemistry with Patric.  It is a shame as he is an OK actor but not used to a pure action role and not used to not having material to work with.  He lacks charisma and is quite unconvincing.  Dafoe is awful; he drags the film down as much as anyone. His villain is a joke and never threatens in the way that Hopper's did (who managed to be funny and scary).  It is a bad impression all round.  The support cast of `innocents in peril' do much the same as the ones on the bus did, but we care less about them - they are well off and are separated from the action; those on the bus were in the thick of it and `normal' people who we could relate to.Overall this is as good a reason for not making unplanned sequels as any - there should be a board to approve all sequels to prevent cashing in!  The memory of the original is cheapen by this nasty film that is uninspiring and unthrilling at best, dull and stupid at worst.  De Bont never gets up a decent head of steam and he shows his inability to inject drama out of his own skill - anyone can point a camera, not everyone can (or should) direct. A dull 2 hours later, I was wondering why I wasted my time with a film that was so clearly all at sea.",

Here, the bus was replaced by a cruise ship and the movie doesn't work, partly due to this: a cruise ship can't go as fast as a bus even if it's trapped.Then, Keanu Reeves' absence can terribly be felt. His replacement is so colorless and listless that Sandra Bullock almost steals the show from him. Moreover, as a rule, \"Speed2: cruise control\" is supposed to be a suspense film. Well, in this case, where's the suspense? The filmmaker doesn't succeed in creating the suspense and he even can't create a disturbing atmosphere. The end of the movie falls into the ridiculous when the ship is entering the dock and destroys everything in its path.At the end: one of the worst sequels ever made.",

            "content": "Let the screenwriters and director go down with the ship I say. As the sun sets slowly in the West, Speed 2: Cruise Control sinks without a trace. The sequel to 1995's surprise drive-a-bus hit has barely caused a ripple at the box office. The threadbare script is mostly to blame. It consists almost entirely of simplistic, exclamation-point dialogue like, \"We're gonna crash!\" \"We're going too fast!\" \"Do something!\" \"This isn't happening!\" \"We gotta get him outta here!\" \"There's not much time left!\" and the ever useful, \"Oh, s**t!\"There is, indeed, not much time left for characterization or interpersonal drama. Speed 2 gets off to a winky-dinky start with Sandra Bullock taking yet another disastrous driving test. Bullock's natural charm can go only so far, however, and you keep wanting to throw her a life preserver or a new script. As people drop dead around her, she must continue to whine about the ruination of her vacation. Bullock doesn't get a lot of help from blandish co-star Jason Patric, who plays her cop boyfriend. The nasty, computer-literate villain, who likes to attach blood-sucking leeches to his body, is certainly quirky. Willem Dafoe, who's pretty quirky himself, does what he can with the overriding vagaries of his character's mad-bomber motivation. The action bits are fairly frequent, but seem anemic when compared to what else is available to fans of such. Director Jan De Bont fared much better in 1996 with the flying cows and funnel clouds of Twister. Speed 2 ends up with some highly anticipated destruction as the cruise ship plows into the island of St. Martin. No matter, as I hear the whole thing was computer-generated anyway. This cruise is no carnival, and could have used a cameo by Kathie Lee. Would loved to have seen Dafoe slap her around a bit.",

Sat through the entire thing feeling like I was at sea in a teacup (in the middle of a cyclone), made worse by the terrible acting (even Temuera Morrison wasn't up to par in this) and lame 'action scenes'. The baddie wasn't bad enough, his reasons for hijacking the ship was just plain dumb, and Keanu Reeves, where the heck was he?\nThis whole flick was over-the-top-bad, trying waaaaay too hard to equal Speed One. But putting all the action on a cruise ship - a SMALL cruise ship at that? There was twice as much action in the elevator scene at the beginning of Speed One!I found the gigantic tanker explosion, the ship crashing through the dock at the end TOO long and boring. By this time, however, the sea sickness had subsided (probably because the ship had already landed!) The ending would've been easier to bare if the characters hadn't said such dumb cliches....\nI think I should've stayed at home....",

It didn't have the 'speed' theme, it was mostly a boat out of control, how? Someone just hacked it, and there it went, it wasn't on the threat of terrorists, there wasn't the threat of a bomb explosion, and it wasn't even sinking. Where's the excitement?

The result is a film that plays like a spoof and is not taken seriously, nor is it funny. The film has no suspense whatsoever and also lacks on excitement. The silly dialogue - especially from Sandra Bullock's character Annie even during action sequences - is so bad it is laughable. The film also has a ridiculous plot that makes nothing believable or convincing. The 'abandon ship' procedure (and the reason therefore) is so utterly pathetic that I won't even go into it!! The ending, which is supposed to be spectacular as the ship crushes everything in its way, is once again marred by silly dialogue and attempts at humor that is way out of place.",

Hence I recently watched the universally panned \"Speed 2\"Plot In A Paragraph: Annie (Sandra Bullock) and her new beau Alex (Jason Patrick, who I last saw in \"Lost Boys\") are taking a vacation in the Caribbean aboard a luxury cruise ship, which is hijacked by a villain (Willem Defoe) who hacked into the ship's computer system. As they are trapped aboard the ship, Annie and Alex work with the ship's first officer (The guy who plays Jango Fett in Star Wars) to try to stop the ship, which they discover is programmed to crash into an oil tanker.OK is it as bad as people say?? No it's far from it. It just doesn't live up to the first movie. A lot of sequels suffer from that problem. Had this movie just being called \"Cruise Control\" and references to the first movie dropped, it may have done better. To put it simply, this is just another routine action movie. The film's final scene, where the ship crashes into the island of Saint Martin, cost $25 million of the film's $160 million budget (which is more than the entire production budget of the first film)As for Sandra Bullock (who agreed to star in this film in order to get financing for her pet project Hope Floats) she remains one of the most talented and beautiful women in movies, and her ladylike sexiness is in rare supply. Any movie becomes promising just by having her name in it's cast.",

(god knows why) After 2 minutes I realized why Keanu didn't accept the role for this second part. The entire movie is filled with extremely bad timed jokes and unrealism beyond recognition... The killer being sandra bullock chainsawing open a fire door with people trapped behind that door (as if there wouldn't be an emergency handle, and what the **** is a chainsaw doing near the cabins?!?) After completing this task sandra keeps the chainsaw in the opening she just made. the people look at her and say she has to get out of the way with the chainsaw. she looks back, doesn't respond. They have to ask AGAIN and then she's all like: \"oh oh oh, yeah yeah yeah yeah, sorry sorry sorry.\" taking another 5 minutes to apologize before she finally removes the roaring blade....another great feature about this movie is the fact that people have to die 4 times before actually dying, or other impossible things that somehow the actors can make possible with their magic wand or something. a nice example: **** SPOILER **** The bad guy (i didn't even bother remembering his name) is flying one of those water planes. He isn't really paying attention as he flies over an oil tanker and hits the mast with a speed over 50 mph at minimum... Instead of crashing down or getting hit off course, nooo... the plane instantly stops and gets stuck at the top of the mast. The bad guy naturally hasn't a scratch. Then suddenly the plane decides to explode, taking the entire oil tanker with it. Of course there couldn't be any safety measures on board, since oil isn't flammable at all. anyway my conclusion is that speed 2 is a blown up piece of poo, and should have never been made. this is one of those movies just to get people in the seats, leaving them to die of boredom in the theatre.

The plot is silly, and a weak attempt at recapturing the essence of the first(which, in turn, was a somewhat half-hearted attempt at recreating that of Die Hard, a film that is far superior to either). Taking the idea(which basically originated in Die Hard... Speed just gave it a shot of, well, speed) out to sea was never a particularly interesting one(what does a colossal cruiser far out on the water have to offer that a bus that needs to keep a high speed on the freeway doesn't?), and what little potential it may have had is hardly utilized. The pacing is, much like that of the first, too intense. We aren't given time to stop and breathe, to take in all the(as a result, downright overwhelming) action. The acting, save for one or two parts, is unimpressive. Odd, seeing as such talented names are on the cast. Morrison and Dafoe have given quite good performances both before and after this film... heck, even Bullock has a fair acting job or two behind her. The dialog is dreadful. The characters are half-heartedly written. Why is Annie now such a crummy driver? In the first one, she was said to be fine behind the wheel. And who thought of adding that annoying Scotsman? Anyone who's seen the film will know what I mean. And no, it wasn't his nationality... it was all his character. The clich\u00e9s return... the new villain also cackles, there's a new hero cop, and the damsel is, yet again, in distress. All in all, this probably shouldn't have been made at all, and it certainly shouldn't have been a sequel to Speed(which, while by no means great, was certainly a whole lot better than this). I recommend this to the fans of the first and of the Die Hard type films who *must* see it, no matter how bad they hear it is(you know who you are!). Everyone else should probably just avoid. 1/10",

What was he doing, paying off a debt? Sandra Bullock is a great lady, but her character is somewhat annoying here, and not really given much to work with. I can see why Keanu Reeves turned this masterpiece of waste down, and why both Bullock and Patric regret this project. Willem DaFoe, to his credit, tries hard as the villain, but he is just an unintentionally comic and moronic madman, and the rest of the characters are cardboard cutouts. Where's Dennis Hopper when you need him? An action-packed thriller? A love story? How about just a severe case of seasickness? Eeeeewwwwwwww . . . . . . Watch this one if you have a strong stomach, are half asleep, or if you need to kill time. Get out the barf bags!",

            "review_title": "Another one of those sequels",
            "content": "You all know what I mean. No one has any original idea so they find a movie that was popular a few years back that did not necessarily need a sequel and then they make one with little thought going into it. \"Speed 2: Cruise Control\" is not only one of those movies, it might be the worst movie I have ever seen that did that. The film stars Sandra Bullock, reprising her role from the original \"Speed\", and a new male lead played by Jason Patric, taking over for Keanu Reeves who smartly bailed out. The villain is played by Willem Dafoe who once worked for the company that made the cruise ship's autopilot and was fired when he became sick. With revenge on the mind, he takes control of the cruise ship and plans to crash it all to get revenge and steal some jewelry.As part of their anniversary, Alex (Patric) and Annie (Bullock) go on a Caribbean Cruise. The film's antagonist John Geiger (Dafoe), takes control of the ship and forces the crew and passengers to abandon ship on threat of blowing the ship up. A small group of passengers and crew are left on board and it's up to Alex, Annie, first mate Juliano (Tempura Morrison), and the small remainder of the crew to stop the cruise ship before it is forced to crash.A line that Bullock's character uses to describe her relationship with Alex is, \"We know nothing about each other.\" Ironically, that is how it is with the majority of the characters, including the two leads. The most we know about our leads is that they are in a relationship, Alex is a cop, Annie is a terrible driver, and any other detail that the audience might remember from Annie that we learned in the first \"Speed\". The only character we get to know is Geiger and he is not very interesting. In the first \"Speed\", we got to learn a little bit about some of the more minor characters on the bus such as Stephens (Alan Ruck), but in \"Speed 2: Cruise Control\", at the most we either get to see who their family is or are told what their job is. We get nothing beyond that. The only character who might be a little memorable is the little girl named Drew (Christine Firkins) due to her being able to take care of herself better than most of the adults in the movie and her creepy line asking Alex to wait for her. Another problem with the film is the actors and the acting. Throughout the whole film, the actors seem uninterested and to not be on their A- game. Bullock is the most obvious example of this. While Bullock is a good actor, she was not trying and sounded more like a whiny child than a person who has been in a similar situation before and can be cool- headed. The next biggest problem is that the film is a one and a half hour story that is told in two hours. There is a chase between Alex and Geiger at the hour and ten minute mark where it could have ended the entire film then and there. However, the movie keeps going, the remainder of the time being filled up with the cruise ship having to avoid an oil tanker and then it crashing into a harbor-side town.With a story that over-stays its welcome, boring characters, weak usage of comic relief, lacking any tension, with a clich\u00e9 ending and being overall stupid, \"Speed 2: Cruise Control\" is a prime example of movie sequels with little thought put into it. I will say that one positive thing is that it does not feel like it insults the audience, but that is about it. My advise? Watch \"Speed\" and stay as far away from this as you can.",

The dialogue is clich\u00e9d and the characterization is thin, and the plot devices are overfamiliar. Jason Patric fails to impose himself as the lead which left Sandra Bullock who was sidelined into producing a frenetic character which she ends up overworking. Willem Dafoe looks the part but he acts tough without seeming tough. All in all, it's action packed but froths over.

The cruise ship's passengers include members of a diamond dealers' association, who have filled the ship's vault with valuable diamonds.

Geiger was fired and cast aside by the computer company he worked for, and he wants revenge......Nowhere near as bad as what people are saying on here, the film is dumb in many ways, but it's a little bit of fun, very bright and breezy, and features a really good explosion at the end.Bullock does her ditsy shtick here, and it really grates at times, so we switch to Patric, who looks more concerned about getting wet and wondering what happened to his hair in The Lost Boys, a dull hero.So we are left with Dafoe, who is clearly having a ball and enjoying the sun and fat pay-cheque.For some reason, UB40 are on the ship, but you never see them again, and then guess who pops up near the end, the annoying bloke from speed, and they homage his scenes front that in this!!!It's lethargic at times and knowing that the budget on this was $160 million, would make anyone hate it, but it's not a bad film and certainly not De bongs worst film.",

Sandra Bullock on the other hand respires her role as Annie but she has since regretted returning to this complete mess of a sequel.Where do I begin? Well first of all there's a scene where Sandra Bullock's character is using a chainsaw to free many trapped people on the ship, why there's a chainsaw on a cruise ship beats me. But after making an opening for them, she's still got the chainsaw on hand and she's got it rather too close to the trapped guy on front, are you f****** crazy? Could have gone full on Texas Chain Saw Massacre on that guy and she's like \"Duuuurrrr\". It's like they turned her character into an idiot while in the original film she wasn't that stupid.The action was very campy, most of the characters are very bad with poor acting, it lacks the seriousness which the original film had and worst of all it's like the people who were making this movie had no clue what they were doing. There obviously was no quality control whatsoever.It just blows my mind that this awful movie is a sequel to an awesome movie and this film is often regarded as one of the worst sequel movies ever. I suggest that you should at least watch the excellent Speed and the Father Ted episode \"Speed 3\", the latter of which is still miles better than Speed 2.",

If not for them, this movie would have 0% on Rotten Tomatoes instead of the 3% it does have. I can see them liking some aspects and some parts, but both guys actually thinking this was a good movie is beyond me. Honestly, I found this movie worse than Batman & Robin. Batman & Robin tried to be cheesy and kiddie, but it accidentally crossed the line between fun and stupidity. That movie's weirdness just got old after a while and was actually fun in many parts. Speed 2 was not comical and did not become old after a while. Here's what happens, Sandra Bullock and Jason Patric go on a cruise were madman Willem Dafoe uses crazy computer schemes to blow everything up. Sounds good and fresh right? The first half-hour actually is good. People having fun on a cruise, Jason Patric going to propose to Sandra Bullock. When the movie switches gears by becoming more of an action movie as Dafoe hijacks the ship, that is when everything becomes very bad very quickly. If the movie would have stayed the way it was the first little bit, I would have liked this movie just as much as Siskel and Ebert. But nobody knew a ship being taken over would not work, that idea hasn't been done a whole lot and when it has been done, it turns out to be a success. The main problem with is the acting and dialogue (the two are in conjunction in this case). Sandra Bullock is one of Hollywood's best actresses who does a mega crappy job in this. Jason Patric started off okay, but the gear switching made him just as bad as his on-screen girlfriend. Everybody else in this movie is just as bad. The saviour is Willem Dafoe. He was the only reason I did not just turn off my TV. Dafoe is an awesome actor who nails this as an insane computer hacker. But even he got stuck with some poorly written dialogue. Some of the destructive scenes on the ship and filming techniques are actually pretty good, until a dumb character blurts out laughable material. But eventually, even the disaster scenes become boring and the CGI becomes funny too.0.5/4",

            "content": "How can this happen? You take an exhilarating film like \"Speed\" which was a big success at the box office, approved by fans and critics alike and then you follow it up with a sequel that fails to measure up. What went wrong? I've seen a lot of bad sequels or good ones that were inferior to its predecessor, but this is the worst one of them all. The thing that angered me the most was that it possessed a lacking effort to even try to even stay in sync with the original \"Speed\" even though it took an enormous budget to make this. The whole idea of the story is completely illogical and convoluted. \"Speed 2: Cruise Control\" sees Sandra Bullock again caught in the centerfold of another hijacking only this time instead of on bus, we are now on a cruise ship complete with dumb passengers and an equally stupid crew. The main baddie is Willem Dafoe who's mission is to mess up the computer systems on the ship that he designed to that it will go on a collision course with a tanker while also taking in possession valuable jewelry.Nobody in the audience wanted this movie to be made and though I never really care much about popular opinions, I have to say that I agree with the majority of the fans. There were signs that this film could have been great. Bullock always has a great deal of charm. Director Jan De Bont was successful in thriller films at the time with \"Speed\" and \"Twister\". Willem Dafoe has been in many great films over the years. It's just a shame that this film was so bad it was beyond repair.\"Speed 2: Cruise Control\" demonstrates that just because it was a big budget film, doesn't mean that it'll guarantee high approval from the masses. The original \"Speed\" had shoestring budget coming in and it became box office gold. Sure it was surreal and illogical, but it gave high tension, a scary but effective atmosphere and character that you truly care about. The sequel, you don't find any of that. Even the action sequences lack any drama or intensity you can be invested in. It's just there for action and nothing more.De Bont's strategy is simple, keep the action running and let the action do all the talking. And if he thinks for one minute that the constant shaking of the camera has any kind of lasting impact on the action scenes, he is seriously wrong. The only thing it does is make your stomach churn.So now we find Bullock back as Annie Porter, who is now in new relationship with a cop named Alex (Jason Patric) who surprises her with two tickets on a luxury cruise, even though she still laments that her ex-boyfriend, Jack (Keanu Reeves from the original \"Speed\" who cleverly backed out) gave her an anniversary gift of pepper spray which resulted her spending some time in an emergency room. While they're enjoying a relaxing vacation, a madman named John Geiger (Dafoe) has nothing but evil intentions as he wants to crash the ship into a tanker and steal some loot.As a rule, most villains are not evil for the sake of being evil, there's always a method to their madness. In Geiger's case he was the one responsible for installing the computer panel on the ship. But one day he reported sick, the next day he was fired where he uses leeches as medicinal remedies for his declining health. It also explains the reasons for his anger.Part of the reason why I saw this movie was because I naturally enjoy Sandra Bullock and her character is easy to become sympathetic with. She's easy to like, makes a few wisecracks here and there and tries to make this movie a bit interesting. Once Geiger takes over the ship, we hope that the number of deaths are few and far between.Sadly the rescue mission getting people off the ship and into the lifeboat was tedious and boring. Though I did wish them that they'd return to shore safely, the scene was badly affected by the soundtrack from composer Mark Mancina.The biggest blunder in \"Speed 2: Cruise Control\" is when the ship loses control and glides into a coastal town located in the island of St. Martin. While civilians can spot surfers, sailboats and ski boats a mile away. But they all can't see a giant luxury liner coming their way. The most labouring part is that the sequence lasts over minutes long and no one sees it coming until it's too late.Although Bullock has an adorable smile, but her smile can be featured in many scenes where there's very little to smile about. When the oil tanker explodes and dozens of people are killed in the process she's still holds her head up with glee like it doesn't phase her in the least. When Alex slips the engagement ring on her finger, her shiny teeth gills the air without knowing that she's to embark on another dangerous misadventure.Is it just me but in movies doesn't it seem ironic that couples seem to form when something terrible seems to happen? It might also happens in the real world too. Maybe this movie would have been better if everything was just normal the way it is. In this movie too many things happen with very little to keep you intrigued.",

Poorly contrived script, abysmal acting, unfunny one-liners, unconvincing action all play a part, but it can all be summed up briefly: the film is just idiotic.

Unfortunately, Speed 2 lacks both of these things, as well as anything else which could make it a good film.Annie (Bullock) is off on a cruise with her new boyfriend, Alex (Patric). But surprisingly things don't go to plan when a crazy ex-employee of the ferry company with a terminal disease (Dafoe) takes over the ship using only his laptop. So its up to Alex, Annie and a few stupid crewmen to save the day.So that's it in the way of plot. I'd go onto character development but there's nothing to say about that so I'll skip to the acting. Although Bullock is given top billing, she is (unfortunately) relegated to the sidelines and Keanu replacement Jason Patric does most of the work. As for his acting abilities, lets just say a coffee table would have been more convincing. And you thought Keanu Reeves was wooden. Dafoe is almost as bad.Another area of dire quality is the script. Actually, atrocious would be more appropriate. Unlike the original it's filled with lots of \"funny\" bits, which only made me cringe even more than I was doing before. Even the action is poor. Where Speed screamed along at 100mph, the sequel kind of meanders along like a pensioner driver.Verdict: Bad story, bad acting, bad script, bad film. Sitting through this film is as torturous as listening to Westlife. So in case you haven't caught on yet, AVOID THIS FILM.",

Surely this movie still can't be rented? Please, don't waste your money, just stick with the first Speed and walk away slowly.At the time I was a projectionist for the movie theater where I worked. I had to watch this film to make sure the print was in good condition and that I put it together correctly. The only thing that made it worth seeing? I guess is that I was on the clock while watching. This movie was terrible and very uninteresting.OK, the first Speed was exciting and interesting. Keanau Reeves is dopey, but he does give cool-headed action hero quality to his characters. So does he show up in the sequel? No. I'm sure he read the script or saw SOME red flag that made him think, \"Walk away slowly\". Perhaps he had other commitments. Either way he was fortunate enough to not be involved in this wreck. The villain, Willem Dafoe, is just not convincing (Ooooh, he's a disgruntled computer programmer!). Jason Patrick's character seems to be a cardboard stand-up, and Sandra Bullock gives classic lines like, \"Oh man!\". The end sequence DOES have an impact, but they drag it out SO LONG that I started laughing! I mean, one minute would have been cool to see all that destruction, but FIVE MINUTES of crashing?!? It might look cool to a six or seven year old (maybe a preteen), but for me it was a barrel of laughs...and this isn't suppose to be a comedy.",

            "content": "Why are so many sequels bad? One of the main reasons is that they were not planned until the first film became so successful. This success prompts movie studios to make a needless sequel in the hope that the name alone will draw big bags of currency. These sequels are often bad because the originals did not leave any space for another movie. \"Speed 2: Cruise Control\" is a sequel in name only. It cost nearly four times as much as \"Speed\" although its earnings were significantly lower. No link exists in setting and plot, and the premises are completely different.Sandra Bullock reprises her role as the lovable Annie Porter, this time with Jason Patric playing her boyfriend. The dialogue explains that she broke up with Keanu Reeves' character from the first film for a number of reasons, but the real reason is that Reeves did not want to make a sequel. A bald Joe Morton and Glenn Plummer have cameos, but aside from that and a few humorous references to \"Speed\" there is no connection.Annie and her boyfriend Alex Shaw (Jason Patric) decide to go on a Caribbean cruise aboard the luxurious Seabourn Legend and have the bad luck to be on the same vessel with John Geiger (Willem Defoe). Geiger spent years designing the computer systems on the ships and can take control from his laptop. He is bitter because his exposure to the computers gave him severe copper poisoning and the company fired him when they found out. He now takes several prescriptions and carries a jar of leeches to suck the copper from his blood. Apparently nobody learned from George Washington's death.After murdering the Seabourn Legend's captain, Geiger sets off a series of smoke bombs, conveniently hidden in his golf clubs, and gives the first mate (Temuera Morrison) fifteen minutes to evacuate. This proves to not be enough time, but Geiger restarts the engine anyway, and sets it on a collision course with a colossal oil tanker.Willem Defoe, The Man with the Golden Laugh, comes through with a rock solid performance once again. He is funny, charming, and extremely weird. Take for example when he vents towards the ship's captain. He sates, \"That's what really infuriates me, you don't even know what I'm talking about!\" in a voice of anguish that does not sound normal. Nothing about Geiger is normal. I felt sorry for him, but not enough to justify his actions. After seeing this and \"Spider-Man,\" my dad wondered out loud if Defoe could go into public places without getting funny looks.The action onboard the ship is the film's best in concepts, execution and intensity. Director Jan de Bont establishes many of the ship's sets so the layout seems familiar when the action starts. It is in the final half hour that the operation falls apart and loses its recommendation. It involves a nutty boat chase and a crash scene that is supposed to be amazing but is undermined by fake effects and jokes that seem inspired by Abbott and Costello.Another turn off may be the absurdity of the stunts, such as the sequence with the seaplane or the bit where Shaw floats mere feet away from one of the liner's propellers and eventually stops them with a cable. \"Speed 2\" embraces its goofiness with pleasure, but overkill proves to be its undoing. It is certainly not one of the worst movies ever made, but it too often crosses the line into farce.",

The original Speed was absolutely awesome, fantastic action scenes, over-the-to casting, directing, script and wonderful music. As for Speed 2, I have the idea that the producers and director thought that if they did another movie, based on the same material, although with different means, Elevator peril-----Motorcycle chase; Bus danger -----Boat Danger and Subway Danger-----Helicopter/ Tanker danger, would work out well. It didn't. Somehow it didn't, the movie is sometimes boring and slow, almost losing its way after 30 minutes in it. The special effects aren't top notch, and don't satisfact the viewer as much as their mission should. Anyway, it's an entertaining film starring once more the gorgeous beauty/genius Sandra Bullock and Jason Patric (replacing Keanu Reeves) and as his predecessor, fills the screen with beauty and charm.See it and (try) to enjoy it ------------------ 5/10",

Everyone agrees setting a Speed sequel on a boat was dumb. I think the original script was a generic script retooled into Speed 2. Annie is honestly a idiot here and Alex is a bland hero.CGI was overused for awhile starting in the late 90s. Unlike Speed, this movie used CGI. The effects are terrible, I guess they were fine back then.Overall, Speed 2 was terrible. It's another lazy sequel which shouldn't exist. Would Speed 2 be better if Reeves were in it?

            "content": "If there was ever an action movie that didn't warrant a sequel, it's \"Speed\". However, the film grossed enough money to be numbered among the big summer hits of 1994, and the unfortunate result is this film, which reunites director Jan de Bont with Sandra Bullock, while leaving Keanu Reeves somewhere safe and dry, \"working on his music\" with his band, Dogstar. Considering the dubious quality of the final product, this may be the wisest decision of the young actor's career. \"Speed 2\" can be numbered among the worst second chapters ever made.The original \"Speed\" was an entertaining jolt of pure adrenaline that took everyone by surprise. De Bont was an instant success and Bullock became a hot commodity. It was almost inevitable that any sequel, no matter how thrilling, would be a letdown. What no one anticipated was how sharply the downturn would be. Not only is \"Speed 2\" missing the first movie's main character, but the excitement seems to have departed with him.This time around, Keanu Reeves, who portrayed Jack Traven in the first one, has been replaced by Jason Patric, who plays a new cop, Alex Shaw. For the most part, they're the same person (it shouldn't surprise anyone to learn that Alex was originally written as Jack), and their function is identical. The highest paid member of the cast, Sandra Bullock, is back as Annie Porter. Now, having broken up with Jack, she's in the midst of a long-term relationship with Alex. Things are a little rocky between them, so Alex comes up with a solution: a romantic cruise to the Caribbean on the Seabourn Legend. However, just like John McClane in the \"Die Hard\" series, Annie is about to find herself in the wrong place at the wrong time. Also aboard the Seabourn Legend is a mentally-unstable computer genius named John Geiger (Willem Dafoe) who intends to take over the ship, crank the engines up to full power, and crash it into something very big.\"Speed 2\" is a classic example of \"sound and fury, signifying nothing.\" Only, in this case, that \"nothing\" isn't bolstered by the high-energy tension and tremendous special effects of de Bont's previous excursion, \"Twister\". \"Speed 2\" is lackluster -- the plot methodically drives the film from one action set-piece to another, and the visuals are merely adequate. In fact, the only real thrill offered by \"Speed 2\" comes during the bloated movie's final half-hour (as the ship's collision course becomes apparent). By then, it's too little, too late.The original \"Speed\" was frantically paced and featured a number of individuals that, in spite of their two-dimensionality, were likable and exhibited human characteristics. We felt like we were trapped on the fast-moving bus with them. This time, the pace and characters are mechanical, and it doesn't seem as if we're actually on board the endangered and slow-moving cruise ship. Instead, we're watching form a detached vantage point, noticing details that we're not supposed to be paying attention to (like what kind of lighting best highlights Bullock's features) or waiting in vain for someone to break into a chorus of \"The Love Boat.\"Jason Patric has only one mode: serious guy. He makes Kristen Stewart look like an Academy Award contender in comparison. There's no sense of fun or goofiness. I never thought I would admit to missing Reeves, but that's the situation here -- at least he understood the right tone to adopt. Meanwhile, Bullock plays the same part the same way (albeit for a lot more money) -- she looks cute, gets involved in a couple of action scenes, and is taken hostage. But Sandy and Jason never click; their chemistry is glacial.Since Dennis Hopper's Howard Payne was decapitated at the end of Speed, the sequel needs a new villain. Enter Willem Dafoe, who's usually a good psycho. Not here, though. Geiger has no manic energy, and Dafoe doesn't seem particularly excited to be playing him. \"Speed 2\" is the kind of film that demands a strong opponent, but Geiger isn't it. And in the end of \"Speed 2\" Geiger dies...laughing? Meanwhile, there are a pointless cameos from musicians such as Carlinhos Brown, Tamia and the reggae band UB40.Watching \"Speed 2\", I felt embarrassed for everyone involved. Sure, they're all being well- paid, but no one wants a $120 million flop on their resume. And, once the word gets out about how disappointing this movie is, crowds will dwindle. There are enough action alternatives out there to sate the public's summer appetite. Someone should have recognized what an appropriate metaphor the climactic sequence (which features massive destruction) is for the entire film. \"Speed 2\" appears headed for a box office disaster of titanic proportions. Creatively and entertainment-wise, it's already sunk.Conclusion: this movie is a total garbage and that no longer left me wanting a \"Speed 3\". What it will be about? Will it be on a plane? No, we already had \"Passenger 57\", \"Turbulence\" and \"Con Air\" before. With a little bit of imagination, would be an outer space travel, with a rocket/shuttle to Mars....a mix between \"Die Hard\" and \"Star Wars\" (paraphrasing a positive review that said \"Speed 2\" was \"Titanic\" with \"Die Hard\")....but with Ben Affleck playing another cop (and Sandy's new boyfriend) who is the only that saves everyone from John Travolta as the hijacker? No, thanks. I'd rather to stay with the bus 2,525 mph and my almost 2 hours of action and explosions of quality than to see that.P. S .: To all those comments that say \"Speed 2\" is better than the first, I don't think they praise it so much because the actor (Jason) has the name of a Power Ranger. So, StuOz, if you didn't think it was bad, go watch \"The Rugrats Movie\" instead (and too for the other comment who says that Drew - the deaf girl - is his favorite character). Just in case, Drew is the name of Angelica Pickles' dad (a character from \"Rugrats\"). And for \"samanthahibbert\", please, this is an action movie, not a romantic comedy of those played by Katherine Heigl (who is maybe your idol).",

Dafoe is simply terrible, hamming it up even worse than Dennis Hopper, all leering grin and wild eyes.The film builds slowly towards it's spectacular climax, in which the ship has a near miss with an oil tanker and crashes into a Caribbean island instead (spectacular but strangely uninvolving), chucking in nonsense involving improbable technology (Dafoe controlling the whole ship with a portable computer), Bullock brandishing a chainsaw, and a deaf fourteen year old girl who has the hots for Patric.

The subtitle references driving a car and the idea that a terrorist is taking over a boat. Sandra Bullock reprises her role and is joined by Jason Patric who plays a cop. Willem Dafoe rigs a cruise ship with bombs that resemble golf balls. From there it is a mad panic to get off the ship (or leave the theatre pending on one's circumstance). Jan de Bont seems to have lost touch with his directing skill. His work in Speed showed great skill and a promising talent for directing action, but alas, nobody figured he fall this badly. Patric and Dafoe are frail images of Keanu Reeves and Dennis Hopper. Patric will rescue Bullock but who will rescue him from this morbid career choice? Dafoe has done better than this and he will hopefully overcome it. Bullock's whiny portrayal of Annie is unnerving. At one point she is even seen waving a chainsaw about. Perhaps she should have tested the blade on the script. What we have here is overspending to the highest degree to the point where a monster truck pile up on TV would be much more entertaining and less pathetic. While Speed is a clever action film with tense action and suspense, this sequel is embarrassing and unnecessary. It is a high budget piece of junk that should be used as shark bait. Score: 2 / 10",

Keanu Reeves was smart\nenough to not go on board of this shipwreck (literally), Sandra Bullock was only in it for the money; Jason Patric became an interesting hero but never captured\nthe same vibes and confidence Reeves had in \"Speed\"; but Willem Dafoe shows that whenever he plays nuts and crazy he always delivers something worth seeing or\nat least worth remembering. This movie is a mess of all sorts, you can watch it drunk or sober and the effect is practically the same: a worthless piece of\ngarbage that hasn't any redeeming quality...except for seeing a cruise ship invading an island.\"Speed\" (1994) was so good that they actually predicted what was about to come in this second installment: \"Relationships based on intense\nexperiences never work.\" Spot on! Annie and Jack split up but the unluckiest girl in the world managed to attract another cop (Patric), and here's a guy\nwho's truly committed in making this relationship work, trying to take it to another level and marrying her but...comes maniac John Geiger, a computer\nexpert who takes control of the ship they're in and complicates the situtation for everyone involved. As usual with the franchise, it's all about revenge\non a system, yadda yadda...I won't deny that there was good action sequences or intense/dramatic ones that made me care for the film - like the deaf girl trapped in the elevator\n(a recycle from the first film but this time with lots of water involved and she was alone waiting for her hero to come). But 1997 was the year of \"Titanic\"\nand if a film couldn't reach a similar spectacle we couldn't care less (20th Century Fox produced both on the same year, by the way). I was annoyed, tired,\nhardly ever impresssed with this mockery of a film. Hollywood gave too much credit and confidence to a lucky cinematographer who had an excellent resume as DP,\nmade two successful films as director and then came this disaster and that is Jan De Bont. His career after this thing? The lousy \"The Haunting\" and the okay\nsecond Lara Croft film that sort of like ended the franchise...revived recently with a reboot. \"Speed 2\" is so bad that it's not even fair or interesting\nenough to pinpoint its countless plot holes, its rushed ending or the lack of more substantial material. A movie like this shouldn't exist, even if the studio is\nlow in box-office - but they weren't as James Cameron's epic proved.It was a boring waste of time...and in my case I repeated the dose - because I'm a helpless\nguy who likes to give second chances to movies and many times I've changed my views and end up loving a film after a second view. This and that unofficial\n007 film with Connery in the 1980's are the tragic sins that I vow to never watch again. Not even if they pay me.\nAs for acting, Bullock mantains the qualities and quirkness of Annie (nice as usual); Patric is cool but he's not intense or fast as Keanu was; Dafoe\nmakes again a great villain; the helpful folks from the ship, played by Temuera Morrison and Brian McCardie, are some of the good reasons to take a look at this\ndreadful experience. They were really good and effective in their jobs, I won't say anything bad about them. Highlight of the film is seeing Carlinhos Brown\nsinging his mega-hit \"A Namorada\" and no one explained to me how the hell he actually managed to get off the boat. Maybe some stop before the final destination...but I don't recall seeing that. What I do recall is that this movie was terribly bad when I was younger and it's still the same aching pain in my head after all these years. Never again because that joke isn't funny anymore. 3/10",

The soundtrack! Music is supposed to set the mood and blend into the film invisibly. The music chosen for this sequence, I suspect, should have been selected to incite pulse pounding nail-biting excitement. Instead, we are treated to a sad, tragedy-laden violin concerto appopriate akin to a funeral dirge. The non-sequitor was surrealistically hilarious.The beaching of the liner. The ocean liner grounds itself not 100 feet out to sea when the bottom of the boat wedges into the sand but OVER the beach and after it tears up the boardwalk taking out a few flimsy oceanfront hotels that would have been carried away a la Wizard of Oz by any respectable hurricane. The writers appear to have neglected that ocean liners don't skim on the surface of water like jet-skis. Even supposing it did, liners are triangular and would fall over if placed on a beach. Ya kinna defy the laws of physics, cap'n!Dreadful failed attempt at suspense. When big boats go bad they do it slowly. Yes it takes miles for a ship at full throttle to come to a stop, but the moment of tension occurs a good fifteen minutes before impact. After that, it's a matter of waiting for the inevitable. It's a matter of forlorn mourning, not edge-of-your-seat terror. Titanic captured this well. Speed 2 desperately tries to make a 30 mph crash have the same feel as a NASCAR crack-up. It just can't be done. To round out the rationale... The acting is wooden, our beloved steely bus driver of Speed has been replaced by a piece of arm candy that Jack would've thrown out the window. Jack supplanted by a generic cleft-chin Dudley Doright named \"Alex\". The rest is recycled badly. A park bench with the Budweiser labels poking out from inside.",

In the first movie, the story is basically finished, but, oh, as a kind of after-thought, they just have to blow up a plane. In the sequel, the mandatory Big Boom (TM) is an oil tanker which is again blown up for no reason that has any shred of relevance to the story (and the explosion is obviously fake, too). This is the kind of thing that characterizes the worst kind of bad action movies - a category into which these movies most certainly belong.My rating of Speed: 5 out of 10.My rating of Speed 2: 2 out of 10.",

Sandra Bullock proves that she\u00b4s the opposite when it comes to choosing parts. Her excuse to why she signed up for this movie was that she wanted to do Jan De Bont a \"favor\", since she got her big breakthrough in Speed, which he also directed. I don\u00b4t really buy Sandra\u00b4s lame excuse. Does she mean that, since De Bont gave her career a big boost, he\u00b4s allowed to ruin it as well? After a few years, Sandra has managed to get up on her feet again, but she had big problems to find good parts at first. This is pretty understandable, because Speed 2: Cruise Control is really terrible.Here, Sandra has a new boyfriend, played by Jason Patric. That\u00b4s because Keanu Reeves decided not to reprise his role from the first film (wise move, Keanu). Anyway, when Sandra and Jason goes on a cruise to the Caribians to relax, a madman (Willem Dafoe) takes control of the ship. But Sandra\u00b4s new boyfriend is a SWAT-member, just as Keanu was, and he decides to stop the terrorist on his own.Speed 2: Cruise Control is too long, the effects are laughable and the characters are some of the most irritating ever created. Pretty soon, you\u00b4ll wish that the whole ship would just sink, like Titanic. If the ship would have sunk, the film would\u00b4ve been great. You can see that the film has a big budget, and the people behind it obviously had high expectations of it, since it\u00b4s the sequel of a very good film. But it doesn\u00b4t have any of the exciting action that the first one had.\nSandra Bullock is very annoying, Jason Patrick is way to dull to carry the film, and Willem Dafoe doesn\u00b4t do a good job either. All the supporting actors are just plain stupid. And the dutch director Jan De Bont only proves three things: 1. that Speed was one time-hit, 2. that he should go back to the time when he was a cinematographer, where he\u00b4s done some very good work, and 3. that he sucks when it comes to writing good scripts.Speed 2: Cruise Control, is one of those films which I will never watch again in my entire life.* out of *****",

The truth is, a 3 hour movie featuring a group of robots crawling in circles repeatedly around a muddy field chasing snails would be at least 10 times more exciting than this dreary, desperately atrocious snooze- fest. If you're confused as to whether you're watching a film or having your soul sucked out by a Dementor, I wouldn't be surprised. The visual effects are impressive, but the action is virtually non- existent, the acting is atrocious, the script is below the bottom of the barrel and for an action movie it's all just so boring. Even though the director of Speed returns, he was clearly a one-hit wonder. Basically, go watch a computer simulation of a ship sinking and you've seen Speed 2, so save some time and do that. 1/10",

Jason Patric, normally a fairly decent actor, is out of his depth with lines that are mostly monosyllabic gems like \"Stop!\" or \"Look out!\" or \"Down here!\" Even Sandra Bullock takes her 'sweet and quirky' role from the first film and overplays it, turning Annie into a hyperactive idiot who needs everything explaining to her, even concepts as simple as 'crashing the ship will be a very bad thing'. Despite Bullock being the star, poor Annie is reduced to 'The Girl', incapable of doing anything without a man's help - a horrible comedown from Speed where she performed heroically under pressure.Not even the effects can save it; the CG ship that so much time and money was spent on creating a decade ago now looks like a plastic toy by modern standards, no more realistic than the models seen briefly in a clip from 'The Enemy Below'.

The myriad problems are reflected in the reviews here, but I'll summarise the worst offences:While logically we know a cruise liner takes a long time to stop or turn, watching a large object try to move slowly in open water for half an hour isn't suspenseful.Sandra Bullock's Annie has gone from a woman driving a bus equipped with a bomb to failing her driver's license test worse than Cher Horowitz. Surely the PTSD of her experience would account for this? Instead of using it as an explanation for why she doesn't want to press the brakes, she babbles about men and love, validly adjusting her hair and sunglasses like she's had a bad breakup, not been held hostage. My theory: they weren't allowed to mention the first movie or her backstory, so went the easy \"bimbo unlucky in love\" route.Jason Patric's LAPD Alex is a breathing, talking mannequin giving a chiseled jaw closeup while doing unnecessarily helmetless motorcycle stunts, underwater stunts, in-air fishing stunts, boating stunts... he can even speak sign language. The only stunt he hasn't mastered is a genuine smile.Willem Defoe is, as always, pitch perfect as mad genius Geiger. His delivery of the camp dialogue and villain's evil laugh are a singular joy.Stunts are frequently used to (intentional?) comic effect, despite the loss of life. A yacht is t-boned by the cruise ship and somehow bursts into flames as if the yachting party packed a dynamite picnic. A speedboat launches up a ramp and into a building. A dog yaps to keep the ship at bay while people are plowed down.The most realistic part of the whole film is when an LAPD officer continues to assert jurisdiction and take control of a situation despite his total lack of knowledge of anything involved whatsoever.",

            "content": "I usually only review movies I've just seen, whether I've just seen them for the first time or have just revisited them, but I've decided to make an exception here. Late in 2005, I rented \"Speed\", the 1994 action blockbuster, and this 1997 sequel, \"Speed 2: Cruise Control\", together. I found the first one, though flawed, to be a great adrenaline rush for the most part. Then I saw this sequel, aware of its bad reputation beforehand, which I could fully understand after watching it! Early last year, I watched the original again. This time, I thought it was mediocre, so I obviously wasn't going to re-watch \"Cruise Control\", which I found to be far below average the first time! So, I haven't seen this 1997 flop in over 3 \u00bd years, but I think I still have enough to say about it.Annie Porter has broken up with her boyfriend, Officer Jack Traven, and now has a new lover, Officer Alex Shaw. Alex has been lying to her about his profession. He is actually another police officer, and Annie wouldn't have dated him in the first place had she known. To make it up to her, he gets two tickets for an ocean liner cruise, so the couple can go on a romantic vacation. However, this vacation doesn't go according to plan. Annie and Alex don't know that there is a dangerous passenger on board the Seabourn Legend cruise liner with them, a man named John Geiger! He is an ex-employee of a computer company, who was fired from his job due to ill health. Seeking revenge, he disables the ship's controls, and sets it on a collision course! It's now up to Alex to try and foil the madman's plans and rescue the passengers! My memory of this film is fairly vague, but I clearly remember my feelings as I watched it. I found that it started out mediocre and just got worse as it went along. By the end, it felt like the dragging adventure had been going on forever! For that reason, after seeing the entire film, I thought it was horrendous! I found that it was far from even being in the same league as the original \"Speed\"! Never before had I seen a sequel THIS far downhill from its predecessor! Since it's been a while, I can't remember the dialogue in this film very well, but that seems to be something this film is criticized for. I noticed some cheesy dialogue during my second viewing of the original, so I'm sure there's more of that in this film. Same goes for the acting. However, for me, the main problem (a HUGE problem) was that \"Speed 2\" was so boring and probably more ridiculously tedious than any film I had seen before! If I saw this awful sequel again, I'm sure I would be able to write a more insightful review. However, since one viewing was bad enough, I do not intend to spend another two hours sitting through this crap again! Even my second viewing of the original \"Speed\" was much better than my only viewing of this follow-up! It seems most sequels are generally considered inferior to their predecessors, but not as far inferior as this one! Of course, most sequels feature the main character from the original film, and this one doesn't. Keanu Reeves refused to return as Officer Jack Traven, but even if he didn't, this movie probably wouldn't be any better. If you like action movies, you might like the reasonably popular original 1994 blockbuster, but regardless of whether you do or not, \"Speed 2: Cruise Control\" should probably be avoided at all costs! If you pay to see it, you just might wish you could get a refund!",

The leading man is uncharismatic and wooden, the villain is pitiful, the \"heroine\" is extremely unfunny and vapid and the little deaf girl is just a ploy for sympathy, which fails miserably.The script is so awful it defies logic. A series of \"jokes\" falls flat (why is the destruction of an entire community at the end supposed to be portrayed as funny? All the stupid jokes they try and make during its destruction seem to indicate they were trying to be comedic.) and the romantic element is below average. The guy telling the girl his police badge number to show his love will not exactly surpass Romeo and Juliet.The villain's motive is never explained, unless I missed that while trying to gnaw through my wrists, and is appalling at best.Overall, unless you want to torture yourself, give this steaming pile of tripe a miss.0/10 if I could.",

Where's Keanu Reeves? I know Sandra Bullock is a cutie, but Keanu really made the original \"Speed\" a top mark thriller where not only was it a original masterpiece of heroes, villains and memorable characters. Now Sandra Bullock reprises her role as Annie where instead of kind of calm, she's annoying and makes me want to kill myself.Instead of a bus, we have a boat now! Jeez, what can go wrong? After Annie's boyfriend Alex (Jason Patric) risks too many challenges on the job, she wants him to take a break on a cruise ship where all of their problems might go away. Think again. The new villain is played by eccentric and gifted actor Willem Dafoe in a waste where his mission is to blow up a ship just for the fun of it. Dennis Hopper's character in the first Speed was not only a sadistic maniac, but used his threats as a way of ransom. Not only did Hopper's character wanted money, but he wanted to show his accomplishment to prove that villains kick ass.Annie and Alex have to stop the new maniac and save everybody. It uses too much of the original movie where there's no spark to explode this piece of dung.",

I knew what i was getting myself into watching this movie with all the negative feedback for this movie, but i just had to see it; I now regret watching it. This movie is nothing like the prequel; Its not thrilling at all and i got bored after the first 50 minutes which was alright to be honest, but it goes downhill after that. The plot is also not great and didn't make sense in some parts, like why would you deliberately let water onto a cruise ship? But the damage was done when they decided to set the movie on a cruise ship which was such a bad idea, especially when the title of the movie is called 'Speed'.To be honest, the movie wouldn't have got so much negativity if it wasn't a sequel of 'Speed' and i probably would give it a higher rating in that case, but i believe the negativity is justified because the prequel was so thrilling, had great action scenes and had a intriguing plot, whereas this movie was the complete opposite. It's so disappointing; no wonder Keanu Reeves didn't want to star in it and i feel sorry for Sandra Bullock who tried getting out of the movie, but had to in order to star in another movie which she wanted to do.",

Not just from of the content of the film, but because the film makers wasted over 100 million dollars making the film whose best aspect is that it shares the same title as the original.Speed 2 consists of a two hour sequence of a bad story, supported by a lot of shallow acting and shocking dialogue.  The first half has the feeling and depth of an episode of the love boat.  Sandra Bullock displays the full range of her acting ability as she did in the first film, but this time the direction and script don't come to the rescue.  Teaming up with Sandra is Jason Patric, who is relatively uknown in big money holywood circles and he shows you why.  His acting is flat, shallow and uninteresting and most of the time you could care if he was water skiing naked off the back of the boat. From here the bad guy (Willem Defoe) starts to do his stuff and the show falls into a ramble of shodily put together events which seems to have little to do with each other or the script.At this point the director probably could have saved the film by playing off the acting skills of Willem Defoe in a head-to-head type matchup of skill and wits.  But the director chooses the special effects path for the film to take and wastes the characters of Willem Defoe and Tumuera Morrison and instead of running away to a speay climax, the film slows to a halt with a scene that explain where the majority of the film budget disappeared to.All I can say is : How dare people waste the sort of money that goes into a such as this!! Was it made as a joke by some hollywood producer to laugh in the faces of smalltime unsigned film makers who could make 50 decent films for the price of this one ? I guess we'll never really know, since all we have as an answer is the two hours of awfullness that sombody called a film.",

            "content": "For those who have seen the first instalment from 1994, Speed 2 this time follows Anne (Sandra Bullock) instead of Jack and lots of things have changed since we last saw Anne escape an exploding bus...Our film begins with Anne attempting her driver's test (and oh boy is she a bad driver now...) and quickly lets us know that Anne has in fact moved on from Jack and their relationship has ended. But thankfully Anne has met someone completely different who is nothing like her last boyfriend... or so she thinks.Anne is disappointed when she discovers her current boyfriend, Alex (Jason Patric), is in fact working as a Swat member just like her last boyfriend did, living day to day like a wild man saving lives. But this time something is different as Alex confesses and sweetens his apology for not being honest by taking Anne on a cruise ship for a romantic getaway. Naturally Anne is mad, but she forgives him on the spot because... Yay for cruise ships, right?But what begins as a romantic time for our leading characters becomes a completely new nightmare when a mad computer hacker alters the ship's computer, sending the large cruise ship straight into INTO OR TOWARDS? an oil tanker.Compared to the original action smash hit, Speed 2 pulls on the handbrake in regards to both plot and its leading characters (yep, I'm getting into it!). The film basically turns Anne into a silly (and annoying) character. Previously we witnessed Anne save lives while driving a Bus, but here Anne is just not the same. At the opening of the film, Anne is trying to complete her driving test and is risking lives, implying she is the worst driver in the world. She lost her licence for speeding in the 1st film... not because she's the worst in the world! Not to mention the film destroys and flushes one of the greatest things from the 1st film- Jack. Let's talk about Anne's relationship. If you liked Jack (Keanu Reeves) previously, you will be shocked to find he's not here, plus the film likes to rag him out as if he were a horrible man. All of this occurs within the film's opening sequence.Instead of Jack, we have Alex, who is suppose to have the same level of skill, perhaps be even more dangerous. Alex and Anne's relationship never feels real and I found it very hard to believe that Alex is a wild man who saves lives. To put it rudely, the film has down-graded when it comes to the love interest, instead feeling cheesy and forced. This element really surprised me considering the film has the same director as the original film.As a plot, it's also a disappointment. Speed had such a fast pacing plot I found myself grabbing my seat at every moment, but Speed 2 doesn't deliver any of these things. Speed 2's general threat is nothing exciting or thrilling. The concept of a boat heading towards an oil tanker doesn't make me sit on the edge of my seat in suspense. Alex and Anne are also dealing with a new villain simply by luck and the film creates no real chemistry between any of the leads throughout the film. But! If I had to pick one character I enjoyed slightly, it would have to be the actor William Defoe who always knows how to play a cool (and yet silly) villain.I'm not all negative about everything in this sequel. I can praise a couple of minor things. Personally I enjoyed hearing the original Speed theme returning, especially during the film's opening sequence as Alex chases a man with stolen goods (cheesy scene but set to a great tune) and to my surprise the film's visuals are pretty solid. The film does take on a brighter tone compared to the last film. William Defoe also gives a couple of creepy moments on screen, but as for the plot and leading actors... Nope I don't like it. If you watch the special features, I was amazed at how much work went in visually, not to mention what the financing of this film would have been. In short, big bucks, big effects, poor results.Overall, this is a rather disappointing instalment to what was an action smash hit. With main characters who are painful to watch and are unbelievable (plus cheesy) as a couple, the same could be about the film's side characters too. Even with some fun visual effects and the return of Speed's instrumental track, Speed 2 is one of those sequels that causes us to question how they got this film so wrong. Other films such as Grease 2, xXx 2, Universal Solider 2 all fall into the same pile of sequels that should ultimately be ignored and avoided at all costs.1.7/10\nWalkden Entertainment",

This lacks so much so many qualities and attributes that the first didn't. There's no terror and suspense at all, even though we know this ship is on a collision course. Most of the film is shot in dark too. Mad hacker John Geiger (Dafoe) who's looked better, has hacked into the control system on this cruise ship, that just so happens to have the annoying Bullock on board with her new Beau (Patric, totally wasted) sending it on a course with death, if he doesn't get his ransom of moolah. Geiger isn't fearing death either, as he is dying from a cancer, his pet worms his real only friends, and also a cure for his pain. Dafoe goes all out with his character, showing us why he's one of those special great character acting talents, where Patric almost looks as though he did out this of desperation for work. When the cruise ship smashes into that makeshift harbor and condos near the end, that part is good for two reasons. 1, it looks really cool, as we wonder where the liner's actually stop, and 2, it's the end. Thank god it's the end of this franchise, but then again, you don't really know what the future holds.",

I was at the tender age of 16, and I thought it was great: action-packed, with great effects and a fun, DIE HARD-style storyline. Well, it still has all those things, but time has not been kind to SPEED 2, and watching as an adult I can see just how poor it is.The problem with the film is the infantile nature of the script, which sounds as if it's been deliberately written for children. Jason Patric's clunky leading man I can forgive, but the supporting characters and their lame comedy are excruciating. The porter and the Scottish guy are bad enough, but Sandra Bullock takes the biscuit with her repetitive attempts at light humour. If ever a film made you despise someone, it's Bullock in this.Otherwise, the story suffers from a little bloating and an ending that goes on way too long, but it does have some stuff to recommend it. The low rent action-man hijinks are a hoot, and Willem Dafoe is fantastic as the over-the-top villain, all teeth and hair and as crazy as he was in WILD AT HEART. The effects hold up pretty well, too.A shame, then, about the child-friendly nature of the production; had this been a proper, adult-focused outing along the lines of UNDER SIEGE it could have been a damn sight better.",

Just watch the entire film and you'll see why: it's flat out boring and lame. Unnecessary sequel. For me, that was a very wise move, Keanu! I would totally give him the props (bro fist) and five thumbs up, not for ditching Jan and Sandra but for criticizing the film's plot, setting and script. He knows what a horrible, shitty sequel is when he sees it. Even if Keanu returned as Jack, he would truly shine as Jack but that's not enough to save this movie. You're better off watching the first film. Great decision Keanu! You truly deserve a raise! Jason Patrick, although he does do his best to shine as Annie's new policeman fianc\u00e9, let's face it: NOBODY, not even Jason can replace Keanu's role (no offence). Jack has just the right facial appearance and the right amount of mischief in his eyes to be a born heroic cop. He's the MAN! Although Sandra, Willem and director Jan try to prevent this already waterlogged sequel from sinking to the bottom of the ocean by inserting some twists and turns, a few action sequences and some laughable dialogue, the biggest flop of this sequel is the lack of thrill with a slow-moving cruise ship rather than a fast, wired-for-explosive-destruction bomb laden city bus zooming above 50 MPH through the streets of Los Angeles and ending up at the airport. Even when the ship crashes into a beach town of Saint Martin bringing it to a halt, look at how slow the ship is, even at full speed. It BARELY damaged the area. I mean, look at the substantial amount of deceleration in this film. It was slower and poorer, like a garbage truck or by watching paint dry. As soon as Kenau declined to reprise his role as Jack, Sandra (as Annie) should have followed. The director Jan could have done a better job at the plot line and setting like have Daniel Payne (Howard's son) avenge his father's death by rigging a huge C4 in the cargo area of a Boeing 737 that Jack, his wife Annie and their two sons are flying on vacation to Hawaii activate if it accelerates above 185 knots and ascends above 2300 feet (the captain or first officer gets injured leaving the other pilot to fly the plane with Jack and Annie assisting him. After ALL the hostages parachute to safety from the moving plane, the out of fuel Boeing 737 nosedives into the ground. Jack, Mac and Annie continue to defeat Daniel using a slightly different scam than from the first film. After Jack, Mac and Annie kill Daniel, they all head home into the sunset or eat pizza in a restaurant. That's more like what the plot should have been; on a fast moving vehicle, with Keanu and Sandra's characters married (they make such an adorable couple) and a few newcomer child actors for the two sons. This flopped sequel just killed the speed film franchise. I doubt there will ever be a Speed 3 (Keanu declined the possibility of a third film) and if there is and reunites Keanu and Sandy, I just hope they can still maintain their young looks from the '90s. Annie's character is significantly reduced here. Also, Glenn Plummer, Joe Morton and Sandra Bullock are the only ones to reprise. Jan should have abandoned the project for a sequel when Reeves quit.",

Basically Annie (Razzie nominated Sandra Bullock) feels her boyfriend, Officer Alex Shaw (Jason Patric) isn't spending enough time with her, but then he surprises her with a pair of tickets for a luxury cruise to the Bahamas. Also on the cruise ship are some diamond dealers' association members, and of course the mad villain John Geiger (Razzie nominated Willem Dafoe), designer of the ship's computer system, with some bombs hidden in his gold clubs and balls. So once in the middle of the ocean, Geiger puts his plan into action by disabling all the ships controls and communications, get to stealing the diamonds on board, and setting th ship to crash. Alex and Annie of course are trying everything they can to stop more explosions, gain back control of the ship, and stop the madman from succeeding.

Upset & worried Alex reassures Annie & then says he has two tickets for a cruise to the Caribbean on board the Seabourn Legend (the TV edit strangely changes the name to the S.S. Legend) where he intends to propose, excited Annie agrees to go on the cruise. However disaster strikes when a bitter computer programmer named John Geiger (Willem Dafoe) decides to hijack the Seabourn using his expert knowledge of the ship's computer systems in order to steal millions of dollars worth of diamonds & then crash it into a huge oil tanker to cover his tracks, that is unless Annie & Alex can stop him...Co-produced & directed by Jan de Bont this was the mega budget sequel to the smash hit action flick Speed which has become regarded as one of the finest action films from the 90's, a general opinion with which I am in agreement with. However conversely Speed 2: Cruise Control has become regarded as one of the very worst action films of the 90's, a general opinion that I am not in agreement with. OK sure Speed 2: Cruise Control isn't any sort of masterpiece or even a good example of the action genre but I thought it was alright & the current IMDb user rating of 3.3 really is too low. The script Randall McCormick & Jeff Nathanson feels like a cross between The Poseidon Adventure (1972) & Die Hard (1988) & was in fact originally intended as the third Die Hard film but luckily the producers of that franchise saw that the script didn't work & went with something else, I suppose with this script lying around Fox decided to turn it into a sequel to Speed but Keanu Reeves didn't want to come back so the main character had to be rewritten & the whole dynamic & familiarity between Reeves & Bullock that could have been explored here is missing. Reeves was replaced by Jason Patric who is a really bland & forgettable actor & the fact that his role is so badly written doesn't help, this is the occasion when we need a Sylvester Stallone or a Bruce Willis or a Keanu Reeves or someone who has on screen presence as an action hero because Patric doesn't have any. The story feels half hearted as well, ironically for a film called Speed it's strangely slow going & lethargic. In the original Speed the action was none stop here it's extremely sporadic & forgettable. I didn't like the villain that much either, he was just one guy, he never kills anyone & he even stops the boat so all the passengers can get off! What kind of a bad guy is that? Having said that he was played by the always watchable Willem Dafoe which helps.Director Jan de Bont turns in a good looking film for sure but the action scenes drag, there's very little threat or menace & there's some irritating comedy relief too. Then there's the subplot about the deaf girl that goes nowhere, the silly scene where Dafoe places leeches on his body & some even sillier scenes bookending the film showing Annie having a driving test. The sequence at the end where the Seabourn crashes into St. Martin & destroys half the town looks visually impressive but isn't exciting in the slightest. The original Speed had an out of control bus careering through Los Angeles while this has a cruise liner sailing through the open sea, the energy & high octane action of the original just isn't here. Also being a PG-13 the violence is really toned down, there's hardly any fights, I can't remember anyone being killed & the language is also squeaky clean which is not what most of us expect from our big budget action flicks.With a supposed budget of about $110,000,000 Speed 2: Cruise Control should have been better, sure it's well made with that big budget Hollywood polish but it's so lethargic & pedestrian. In an interview Sandra Bullock described Speed 2: Cruise Control as 'the biggest piece of crap ever made', Gary Oldman turned down the role of the villain to do Air Force One (1997) instead (good choice) while Jason Patric has not got a leading role in a Hollywood film since. According to the credits the band UB40 are in here somewhere.Speed 2: Cruise Control (wouldn't it have been great if this had stared Tom Cruise? You know, because of the title...) is nowhere near as good as the original Speed but isn't as bad as many make out, it passes the time & there are a few big budget spectacular set-piece sequences that are pretty to look at. If you want to see a proper action film set on a big boat watch the Steven Seagal flick Under Siege (1992) instead.",

Her own personality shines through, and she emerges untarnished.  Wish the same could be said for Jason Patric.One question: this is so clearly a movie version of the novel BUZZ CUT by James W. Hall, why isn't he credited?",

            "content": "The problem with being a sequel is that you have to live up to the original. Nowadays, this isn't much of a problem because hit movies are easily predicted, and the masses flock to the best advertised ones like sheep. But \"Speed\" was an unexpected success story, and because it made a lot of money, a sequel was put into the works. The result was a film that was vilified by the critics and public alike.I'm honestly surprised that the reviews of \"Speed 2: Cruise Control\" are so vicious. While I won't deny that the original is better (a LOT better), the sequel isn't as bad as some people make it out to be. It contains its share of flaws, but it does a lot of things right.After the events of the original, Annie Porter (Sandra Bullock) is liking the peaceful life. She has a new boyfriend, Alex (Jason Patric), and he surprises her with a week-long cruise. Someone should have warned him about her propensity for disasters (and NOT just because she's a bad driver). Also on the cruise is John Geiger (Willem Dafoe), a psychotic computer genius with an ax to grind. Shortly after the couple gets on board, Geiger takes over the ship and sets it on a course for disaster.The film's biggest mistake was doing casting Jason Patric as Alex. Keanu Reeves turned down the role to tour with his band, but judging by his performance, they should have offered Reeves more money, or gotten someone else. Patric is awful. His performance is so wooden it makes Reeves, who is not a versatile actor either, look good. At least Sandra Bullock is back as Annie. Annie is adorable as always, and she is used to this sort of thing, so she gets to give a few one-liners, which are pretty funny. As Geiger, Willem Dafoe is great. He's creepy, and not just because he puts leeches on himself. Dafoe is so good that he gives Dennis Hopper a run for his money. Rounding out the cast are Temura Morrison, Brian McCardie, and Royale Watkins.Director Jan de Bont has a lot of fun with this movie, and it shows. He doesn't take this sequel as seriously as the first, so there are a lot more one-liners and jokes. But he still manages to get some thrills packed in the movie, and that's the important thing. One thing I didn't like is that he used slow-motion too much, and in some scenes he has a tendency to move the camera a lot.\"Speed 2\" is not as good as the first movie, but it's still fun!",

The action sequences are really good I did think it went on a bit too long and it would have benefited from being a bit of a darker movie but other than that very enjoyable certainly not as bad as some people seem to think!

Moreover, I noticed that it somehow ended Jason Patric's promising career back then. And aside from hundreds of offensive reviews all over the internet, Sandra Bullock, the movie's lead and producer, referred to this movie as \"The biggest nonsense ever made\"!!OK, something is wrong in the world. I call it The Parrot Theory. Just one person on the plant says that this movie is bad, so millions of people just replay the same thing over and over again perfectly blind, ending up with believing themselves! On IMDb, it happened so many times when all the reviews says: \"It's the best, it's the greatest, blah blah blah\" or simply the same thing in the same words, then you watch the movie, or the real stinker, to understand that maybe 1) These people have an awful taste, 2) These people most probably didn't watch the movie!, 3) Perhaps the major studios hired many persons to log in the site and write good, mostly very naive, reviews to promote their film, or 4) All of the above! Just read the majority of the reviews in cases like (Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Man's Chest - 2006), then watch the movie itself, and believe me you'll going to be surprised.. Truly surprised!Of course when it came to (Speed 2), with all of the aforementioned, I got axiomatically a very bad idea about it. So I kind of avoided it many times. But when finally I got the chance to watch it, I find myself so confused out of all the ugly reputation, or rather the ugly propaganda that this movie had. I even began to recall rare opinions for friends of mine that said once some things like: \"Keanu Reeves made a mistake not doing this\", \"This is a cool flick\", \"The sequel delivers\"! First of all, as a disaster movie, it's different and very good. The action sequences were well written and directed. Even the Hollywood exaggerations weren't that badly made, or seemed silly. I know that it was strange for some that LAPD man could handle the situation in a ship, but he's the maverick heroic lead, that the script fairly didn't put him in illogical frame, or granted him an over-the-top Superman's halo either.Yes, the evil man is crazy, but that's the stereotype in the American action blockbusters during the 1990s; so intelligent, so advanced, so evil, and so mad! And according to this formula, this movie didn't go wrong; on the contrary, he was a victim for the company who pursued a revenge on it, and a huge amount of money as well, using his experience of controlling the ships to destroy one brilliantly, let alone the details about his sickness (the leech) which were new, distinguished, and gave some sympathy for the character.There is a big fuss about the movie's end where the ship bisects the harbor and part of the city, while it's unprecedented, quiet ambitious, and so clever sequence that I've never seen in movies of that kind. And the CGI, the special effects, the set designing all was ideal.The acting was clever, I was sick of the way the viewers smashed Jason Patric??, complaining that Reeves was better?! Basically Patric is charismatic as Reeves or higher, and please, Patric is surely better as an actor. It's so sad how the producers exiled him out of Hollywood, not even giving him the chance like many others, while he's better than working so-called stars that we suffer from daily!Maybe because it doesn't own the unstoppably explosive persona, the bolt-of-the-blue effect, or the theme music of the original; it was disappointing for the first movie's fans. They went to see the same thing, to find another (Speed - 1994) structure, with - for instance - a 20 minutes long start about many talking characters, a cool cruise, and 2 hesitated lovers, instead of unbroken breathtaking cliffhangers from the opening credits as part 1. Maybe the tension of the ship's lights, being on then off repeatedly at one point, was a bit annoying. Or maybe (Titanic - 1997) was around in the same year, with sinking ship also (and a Billion Dollar profits!). But definitely, as a whole, (Speed 2) didn't deserve the hate reviews; I know that I enjoyed it as an escapist, solid big action, and smart disaster movie.To all the ones who banned it non-objectively or without seeing it, talking in parrot fashion \"This is the worst sequel\", sorry, but I had to replay \"These are the worst sequel's reviews\", being clueless, or deluded, or hungry-for-deformation anyway.",

For some reason, the back of the van he's chasing opens by accident and various objects come spilling out, so he has to avoid them, as if in some primitive video game. Why is all this happening? We don't know, we don't care. Then things really slow to a crawl on a cruise ship, on which our returning heroine, Bullock, and her new beau (Patric) embark to avoid a break-up - will the thrills never stop, er, begin? Enter the villain, Dafoe, terminally ill and with a fondness for leeches. If you're in the mood to just relax and enjoy the Bullock personality out at sea, then maybe this movie's for you, but this was not the reason this picture was made. No, it was to provide spills, thrills and chills! What we get, mostly, is a lot of confusing action on the big boat, much of which takes place in darkness after the villain sabotages everything. Patric appears uncomfortable in many of his scenes; Keanu Reeves passed on this movie, a canny move seems like, and a search was on for his replacement. Hm, so who do they select - an actor known for his moody character roles in edgy dramas; sure, he'll do! A sign of how bad this gets: the more interesting point for me was spotting a passenger who also had a small role in the elevator scene from the previous \"Speed.\" Plummer also returns, in a wildly improbable turn of events, and manages to be somewhat entertaining - a sad comment on everyone else. Finally, we have the climactic $25 million wreckage scene; it's slow going like everything else. The final nail in the coffin of this pic?

The original Speed film has everything that this film is missing.The script is very poor. I know that it's supposed to be juxtaposition to the first Speed film but some of the scenes towards the end are like watching paint dry - the action is so slow.",

The first thing that annoyed me almost as much as Sandra's voice was her saying \"my ex-boyfriend Jack...my ex-boyfriend Jack...\" The second was who the hell is the bad guy??? He doesn't get an introduction, he doesn't get properly explained. He just IS the bad guy... why do we care? We're trying to watch the SEQUEL to Speed. The only thing it has in common with the first film character-wise is Annie, and her going on and on about \"her ex-boyfriend jack...\" I don't blame him for breaking up with her!!! She's so annoying!!! A sequel is supposed to be a developed version of the first one with roughly the same people, this only has Sandra Bullock. Its basically the same movie. On a boat. With bad acting, and a rubbish ending. I wish that I hadn't watched it. And the ending??? SO CHEESY!!! OK that was developed from the first, in a weird way, but it didn't work. It makes the first film look bad. The sequel could have been amazing someone getting revenge for Howard Payne, but not on a boat, there are enough forms of transport that go at high SPEED that they could have used instead. I think that it was to big of a coincidence that Jason Patric's character is in the LAPD with the same boss who is only in one scene. Wouldn't he know who Jack was? There was only one thing I liked about it the guy that Jack took the car from in the first movie is used again, but this time they're taking is boat! Apart from that I really didn't like it, I wish I hadn't watched it. Thats 121 minutes of my life I'll never get back. If you can avoid it then don't watch this movie.",

            "content": "Speed 2: Cruise Control earns its spot as one of the worst sequels of all time, right amongst such ill fated sequels including but not limited to Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987), Jaws: The Revenge (1987), Rocky V (1990), Robocop 3 (1993), Batman and Robin (1997), Mortal Kombat: Annihilation (1997), and A Good Day to Die Hard (2013). Riding from the success of the 1994 action blockbuster Speed, the question on everybody's lips were: \"When is there going to be a Speed 2?\" The answer, the box office bomb Speed 2: Cruise Control which was a critical and commercial failure.Keanu Reeves wisely passed on the sequel which turned out to be an excellent career move. Sandra Bullock returns in her role as Annie from the first movie. This time her new boyfriend Alex Shaw (Jason Patric) is also an LAPD SWAT officer who is also a thrill seeking motorbike riding daredevil, but has opted to keep his career a secret from Annie, instead telling her he is a beach patrol officer. Alex has bought 2 tickets for him and Annie to go on a Caribbean cruise aboard the Seabourn Legend. Unfortunately for Alex and Annie, the Seabourn Legend has been taken over by a disgruntled computer engineer John Geiger (Willem Dafoe) who has sabotaged the ship as revenge against the company which terminated him when he became ill as well as stealing the diamonds on board the ship. Annie and Alex, who have been caught up in the wrong place at the wrong time, must stop Geiger from successfully executing his plan as well as save the passengers on board the ship.Unlike the fast moving action blockbuster Speed, Speed 2 is absolute nonsense that just milked from the success of Speed. The excitement level is minimal compared to the first movie and it lacks all the thrills from the first movie. The stunts are unrealistic and the action sequences are of a below average standard. The dialogue including many of the one liners are also pathetic. I've noticed that the violence had been watered down and bubble gum action has been substituted.Jason Patric is a poor substitute for Keanu Reeves as the lead hero. He was just lame. Sandra Bullock had more character in the first movie, here she is screechingly irritating. I don't blame her in the slightest for her later admissions of regretting to return to this dud of a sequel. Willem Dafoe is the only redeeming feature of the movie as the main villain Geiger. He chews up every scene he is in and he saves this movie from being a complete dud. Speed 2 has harmed Jan DeBont's career as a director and since then he has followed up with the box office flops The Haunting (1999), and Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life (2003). Since then he has disappeared off the radar.It's no surprise that Speed 2: Cruise Control has the dishonour of making every list featuring the worst sequels in history. I don't blame fans of the first Speed who would rather banish Speed 2: Cruise Control from their memory and treat it like it never existed.If you want an exciting action movie, stick with the first Speed. Speed 2: Cruise Control is a disappointing movie that sinks to the bottom of the ocean.3/10.",

Just like \"CON AIR\" and \"AIR FORCE ONE\" needed the help of John Malcovich and Glenn Close respectively, SPEED 2 needed the mercenary-like help of star William Dafoe.I don\u00b4t question Dafoe\u00b4s motives to enrol in this kind of cheesy project -I would also put up with some embarrassment for the alleged millions he cashed in with this movie- nor I question the producers for signing up a designated hitter to give the movie some credibility. What I do question is the taste and self esteem of those people older than 25 who really, really, really believe this movie had anything good in it. Hey! I still respect their opinion, but I certainly would tell my sister not to date them.Sandra Bullock is charming. True. Did that make her do well in this film? I don\u00b4t think so. She\u00b4s right to regret taking part in this sorrowful affair. The boat? the speed? the coincidences? Please!

The movie started off okay and at a steady pace, and I was somewhat enjoying it! Then as the movie progressed, section by section, it rapidly declined and I was constantly checking the runtime to see how long the movie had left, because I wanted it to be over. The storyline was so sloppy, uninteresting, and there was little to no character development. I didn't grow attached to one character; not one. That's sad. Toward the end of this movie, I actually started to root for the bad guy, John Geiger (Willem Dafoe). As sadistic as it sounds, I was hoping the cruise ship would collide front on with the oil tanker at full speed so they both exploded, and Dafoe would get away with his jewels and live happily ever after. You know a movie is pretty ordinary if you're not rooting for the good guys, and you want a disastrous ending instead of a happy one. At least it would have made the movie somewhat exciting. And what was with the scene where the cruise ship became beached on the towns edge? It was just a little excessive. For how little the ship actually went inland, it seemed like it went at least a km, because it dragged on for quite a long time. Also, was the entire township made with a wooden ground? The ship was at least 50 meters past the docking area and wooden planks were still being ripped up by the ship. I don't understand... I don't plan on ever watching this movie ever again, because there are better ways to spend 120 minutes.. In all honesty, this movie went for 2 hours and 1 minute too long, though still not the worst movie I have ever watched. I'll be generous and give this movie a 3/10",

After the original helpless boy, in \"The High and the Mighty,\" the child must be a girl. Girls are more pitiful. She needs a kidney transplant or the transfusion of some rare blood type to save her life. Obviously there are going to be problems fitting this stereotypical sick child aboard a cruise ship. After all, if you're going to rush your kid someplace, you don't ordinarily put her aboard a cruise ship full of rich drunks, gamblers, and leisurely honeymooners like Sandra Bullock and Jason Patric. So this pretty little girl is made mute, deaf, and speechless, and she's trapped in the elevator on board a ship that appears to be on fire and sinking. That's the best the writers could come up with. I feel like apologizing for them.However, on the plus side, every other single action movie clich\u00e9 that you can think of is on reckless display in this piece of dumbed-down and mentally dangerous garbage.Just take the sound track. There is an alarm bell constantly ringing in the background, overwhelming speech, even though everyone is shouting hysterically. (Except the mute little girl, of course, who must use sign language.) The music thumps and stomps most of the screams into oblivion. The camerman wobbles all over the place, probably drunk on excitement.During the first major crisis -- a lifeboat is hung up on the davits -- the editing is so lightning-fast -- a shot of a spinning winch, a terrified face, a cable snapping thread by thread, a body falling into the sea, arms waving, hands grasping for something just out of reach, an explosion of flashing lights, computer screens turning into a fireworks display, the director dashing momentarily in front of the camera and giving the audience the finger -- that you can't follow events. Each shot lasts for one blink of one eye, dashing past like muscae volitantes on speed, until they blend into one another and form a stupefying collage of abandoned movement.I rather liked the original \"Speed,\" which was thoroughly mindless enjoyment.

            "content": "As far as brainless action movies go, Speed 2 is probably undeserving of the barrage of abuse it has received ever since it first hit cinema screens back in '97. That isn't to say that it's a good film \u0096 it isn't. In fact it fails on nearly all counts. But it still isn't the absolute disaster so many people seem to hysterically claim. That it would fail was an absolute certainty. A cruise liner travelling on an open ocean at around 20mph just isn't going to push the thrill button the way a runaway bus careening around the streets of America at never less than 50mph does: it's like staging Die Hard 2 in a one-bedroom flat. And having Sandra Bullock reprise her role as the borderline dippy Annie Potter merely serves as a reminder of the gulf between Speed and Speed 2.When we meet Annie she has dumped Jack Traven because he lives life too much on the edge for her comfort, and taken up with Alex Shaw who, to her surprise, turns out to be as much of a life-edge liver as the hunk she's just dumped. The couple decide on a romantic cruise together to overcome the shock to Annie's system but, this being a sequel, lightning is about to strike twice as they have chosen the exact same cruise on which bonkers John Geiger (Willem Dafoe) has set his sights. Geiger worked for the company that designed the liner's on-board computer system, but was sacked when they discovered he had a weird leech fetish and a violent golf game. Outraged by this injustice, Geiger plans to hijack the liner and ram it into an oil tanker after first relieving it of a load of jewels.The main problem with Speed 2 is that it is almost totally lacking in tension. Only for a period of about thirty-seven seconds as Shaw and the ship's photographer (don't ask) repeatedly dive underwater to do something clever with a wheel to divert the liner from running into the oil tanker is any kind of suspense generated. Willem Dafoe certainly appears to be enjoying himself, but director de Bont really should have asked him to tone his performance down a bit \u0096 he flashes those huge gnashers and rolls his eyes like a complete loon which just makes him look ridiculous rather than menacing. He has also written one of those computer programmes that present the kind of screen that only ever appears on Hollywood movies. When I punch the wrong access code into my computer, I get a little grey box about two inches square saying incorrect user password \u0096 Hollywood computers get flashing messages in size 24 font dramatically announcing that access is denied. Bullock is relegated to comic relief for much of the film, and is merely another helpless female for the rest \u0096 she's also pretty annoying much of the time. Speed was the film that catapulted her onto the A-list and we can only assume there was a clause written into her contract stipulating that she star in any sequel \u0096 either that or they offered her a shed-load of cash for which she was prepared to risk her career.Bottom line: go into this expecting an average run-of-the-mill action adventure flick and you will probably only be mildly disappointed. Expect something on a par with its predecessor and you will be as hysterically indignant as the majority of reviewers.",

I remember when this movie opened in June 1997 thinking \"why did they make a sequel to a great action film?\" For years, I had shyed away from seeing this movie(mainly because I wasn't interested) and now, 8 years later I finally decided to watch it. My one line summary of \"Speed 2\" basically summarizes everything I want to say. That is, this film is a great example as to why MOST sequels should not be greenlit. \"Speed 2: Cruise Control\" has everything you love to hate about a movie or a sequel in general: bad acting, paper thin plot and a terrible script. Jason Patric(in place of the more charismatic Keanu Reeves) is the hero this time around and does not live up to what an action hero should be. Sandra Bullock, this time around does not come off as cute or charming but rather annoying in this bland sequel.If I had to really think, I would probably say Willem Dafoe is the only good thing about this movie but even he is terrible as the film's main villain itself. I think the main problem with \"Speed 2\" is that it severely lacked the charisma the first \"Speed\" had. Overall, I hope the producers learned their lesson with this one. By the way, who's \"genius\" idea(sarcastically) was it to rate this film \"PG-13?\" In the end \"Speed 2: Cruise Control\" was a lame attempt at cashing in on the success of the first film but ultimately fails in doing this.",

            "content": "** out of ****Wow, this film along with Batman and Robin were perhaps the worst received big-budget sequels of the past decade.  Critics were mostly mixed over Speed 2, but audiences mostly panned it from left to right.  This is a surprise: the audiences actually hate a summer movie far more than the critics did. Do I agree?  While I do say that this is an extremely unnecessary sequel and that it does take quite a while to get moving, when the action starts there's enough all-out carnage and disaster sequences to keep it entertaining enough to watch, despite the lame story.As a sequel, Speed 2: Cruise Control's link to its predecessor is tenuous at best.  Something tells me its reception would have been warmer had it decided to cut off its connection with the much loved original.  Sandra Bullock is pretty much the only similarity the two films have, as well as some crises involving vehicles, though of considerably different sizes.  As to where the first film involved a bus, this one's a cruise, and a big one at that.The movie begins with Annie Porter (Sandra Bullock) and Alex Shaw (Jason Patric) heading on a cruise for a vacation of sun and fun.  Unfortunately, there's a computer terroist on board, John Geiger (Willem Dafoe), who has a plan to hijack the ship and steal its jewels without anybody knowing. He plants devices all over the ship, causing havoc and it leads the crew to falsely believe there are fires on the ship, thus they must evacuate.As Geiger's plan unfolds, Shaw begins to realize Geiger is the one behind this and searches for him.  He then discovers Geiger's purpose, which is to ram the ship into an oil tanker.  With time running out, Shaw must find a way to veer the ship off its disastrous course.Speed 2 begins fairly slowly and it takes awhile to build up momentum.  The first few action scenes aren't particularly good, but some excitement is created when the crew discovers the ship's final destination.  So, for the last 45 minutes director Jan De Bont stages some well-executed action sequences (actually, it's pretty much non-stop in those lost 45 minutes) that rival the original in its pacing and outdoes it in size and scope.  De Bont basically tries to outdo himself.  In the original, a bus ran into a pile of cars.  In this film, a cruise rams into the port of a small town, destroying virtually everything in its path.  In the first movie, the bus explodes in grand fashion.  In this one, an oil tanker blows up in an even larger explosion.  With all this sound and fury, there's just something missing here: the sense of frantic urgency due to the characters.Admittedly, in technical terms, the pacing is frenetic, but you don't particularly care for any of the characters all that much.  This new cast isn't likeable or developed well enough to elicit any real sympathy, unlike the passengers aboard the bus in the original.  The people whom we get to liking the most are a deaf girl and the second mate, but neither are given a chance to really make much of an impression other than be part of the visual spectacle.As I stated earlier, De Bont hasn't lost his flair for action scenes, but he needs a much better script to work with.  The plot's hardly worth mentioning and the dialogue isn't much better.  The worst must be when Annie escapes the grasps of Geiger, who starts shouting, \"Come back!  You're supposed to be my hostage!\"  Dear Lord, it's hard to imagine  anyone writing that without some self-parody in mind.The acting is serviceable.  Jason Patric makes a fairly effective action hero when it comes to the physical work.  He just doesn't exude the charisma Keanu Reeves had.  He also takes the film far too seriously.  Sandra Bullock isn't that different from her previous performance as Annie Porter.  She's still the feisty, fun-loving girl who's out to have a good time.  She's okay in her role, but there's no chemistry between her and Patric.  Maybe it would have worked had the two been complete strangers on the cruise.  Willem Dafoe is quite bad as the villain.  He's among my favorite actors and it's a pain to see him relegated to a role this weak.  Basically, all he has to do is look menacing once in a while, and incompetent as well, which seems required out of movie villains in big summer blockbusters.\nIt seems by now that the movie is considered a dud by virtually everyone. Even actress Sandra Bullock has disowned it (though, methinks this had more to do with audience reaction and the box office numbers).  Still, there's enough visual spectacle to keep undemanding action fans satisfied.  The script is a true dud and the movie as a whole is still only middling at best, but at least the film acknowledges it's nothing great.",

            "content": "OK, so it's not as good as the first movie. In fact, in the trivia section, it notes that director, Jan De Bont had another idea of making a sequel about a plane that cannot ascent a certain altitude without exploding. Now that might just have made for a much better squeal & maybe, just maybe Keanu Reeves might have stayed onboard for that. Who knows?Speed 2: Cruise Control is by no means an Oscar winning movie but I've rated it a 7/10 merely for the entertainment, quirky lines & explosive effects that we see towards the end of the movie. It's clearly not a massive action-packed thriller like the first movie but it has potential & it's a nice little family film for all to see.There's some degree of secondary billing far as Sandra Bullock appears, she has more of a massively featured role in the first movie but here I feel like she's taken a bit of the back seat with regards to her role as 'Annie'. Jason Patric, however, makes the greatest hero here however, the climbing up to the cockpit to save Annie while it's bouncing across the sea was just superb. And he looks great!This movie is one of a kind, sure to entertain all. However, I wouldn't say it's for those that don't like cruises and if you get easily sea-sick, then give this a miss.",

The direction which was made by Jan de Bont as in the first movie, it was below average and it did not keep the good work while it did not follow the successful steps of the first movie.

            "content": "Another film watched for the \"How Did This Get Made\" podcast, although one I had, or course, seen before. It is legendarily poorly thought of, and indeed, it's not good - though I'm struggling to put my finger on exactly why.Annie (Sandra Bullock) discovers that her boyfriend Alex (Jason Patric) is not the staid policeman she thinks he is, but instead a daring and impulsive SWAT officer. By way of an apology, and with a plan to propose, Alex takes them on a Caribbean cruise only for the ship to be hijacked by John Geiger (Willem Dafoe) a former employee with an axe to grind and the technical knowledge to take control of the vessel. Instead of abandoning ship with the rest of the passengers, Alex decides to stay and help bring Geiger to justice.I suppose it's hard to say exactly what's wrong with the film, because rather than any one particular aspect, there are instead a bunch of smaller aspects that don't quite work. I don't think Jason Patric is particularly awful here, even if, especially looking back at this career now, he's not generated the iconic roles that Keanu Reeves has. Sandra Bullock is as charming as ever, but it's interesting to read in the trivia section here that both she and Patric, and even director Jan De Bont, all did the film because they were contractually obliged too, or to generate funding for a project they actually cared about.There are certainly some spectacular (or at least, spectacularly expensive looking) moments at the film's conclusion, with a giant explosion and the crashing of the ship into a small town. I guess you just have to mentally ignore the idea that many people are chopped to bits by the propellers in the run up to that an assume that they get away somehow. The actual conclusion of the story though, and the end that Geiger meets is quite disappointing and random though and seems more accidental than just desserts.With cast and creative forces seemingly focused on other projects, it's perhaps fitting that I too couldn't keep my interest levels in the film up.",

How dare they even put Speed as part of the title.  A COMPLETE insult as far as I'm concerned.  I always think of this movie as \"the rubbish one without Keanu Reeves\".That brings me to the first thing I hated about this movie.  I missed the obvious on-screen chemistry between him and Sandra Bullock and is it because Reeves didn't take part in this film that the writers turned his character (Jack Traven) from being a really cool guy sound like a complete jerk. The guy they replaced him with was CERTAINLY no Keanu Reeves and I wouldn't be surprised if this film ended the actor's career (I've yet to see him in anything else).Cruise Control's villain was far to comic for my liking and lacked that certain 'something' that made Dennis Hopper's portrayal of Howard Payne a worthy adversary to Reeves' Jack Traven.  Dennis Hopper's acting in Speed was FANTASTIC and, again, the chemistry between him, Keanu Reeves, and Sandra Bullock was strong and not lost among the BRILLIANT Special Effects and EXCELLENT stunt work unlike Cruise Control.The acting talent and chemistry between the characters in Cruise Control is totally lost and nowhere near as strong as that in Speed.Even the special effects in Cruise Control don't seem to have the same impact as those in Speed.Reeves and Hopper ARE missing from this and noticeably as well.  Reeves because he declined to appear and Hopper because his character lost some...height...in Speed and Bullock should NEVER have been in this at ALL!Avoid Cruise Control like the plague!!!

            "content": "Summer 1997 - a high-octane trailer for Speed 2 precedes Con Air in cinemas. Audiences are impressed. \"That looks good\", they say. Con Air is a number 1 hit in early June. One week later (Friday the 13th no doubt) it is knocked-off the top spot by Speed 2. Audiences are still shell-shocked by the trailer and by memories of the 1994 hit. By the following week all goodwill that anyone was willing to lend the film had evaporated and it plummeted from the top spot at the box office to fifth. Two weeks later it would be out of the top 10. A bad result for a $110-million movie.Speed 2 was originally scheduled for release in the UK in October 1997 but was switched with Volcano (another Fox production) for an August 15th release date. Apparently Fox wanted to be done with the movie as soon as possible. This was before the internet allowed every minute detail of a movie to be scrutinized before its release. Speed 2 wasn't released worldwide as much as it was purged.I hate Speed. Keanu Reeves is a terrible actor and I have called his performance in that film one of the worst efforts in the past two decades. He is superseded in Speed 2 by the much more likable Jason Patic as Alex Shaw, an LAPD renegade who takes Annie Porter (Sandra Bullock playing up the ditzyness) on a cruise on the Seabourn Legend (a real ship) in the Caribbean. Their holiday is interrupted by John Giger, a likable maniac in the Travis Dane mold who seizes control of the ship and plans to rob the purser's safe in revenge for being fired by the parent company.Most of the passengers are evacuated onto lifeboats, leaving a handful in danger as the ship heads forward at a whopping 14-miles-per-hour on a collision course with an oil tanker. It is incredibly dumb and stupid, but is still very entertaining and infrequently exciting. The running time is a little bloated, and it could have excised all of the \"running around in dark corridors\" scenes for a superior final cut. There is also a very, very annoying Glaswegian character (who speaks correct English, which no Glaswegian has done since the dawn of time) called Merced, which is probably the most far-fetched thing in the entire movie as people from that particular place are never called Merced. They are called disgusting names like Stuart McGeechnie, or Colin McGillvary, or John Muirhead. They are not called Merced. If he were also cut from the final product it would most certainly raise the overall rating.One of the more curious things about Speed 2 is that it was rated PG in the UK (compared to the 15/R-rated original). Usually I would cry sacriledge at this family-friendly rating but it barely caught my attention back then and in retrospect it actually helps. Speed took itself very seriously. Speed 2 does not, and the jokey, goofy tone makes it much more enjoyable.Mark Mancina raised the bar on action scoring with his iconic effort in 1994 and he delivers probably the best score of his career with Speed 2. It really proves what one can do under pressure as Mancina was scoring Con Air when he was called away early to work on Speed 2 (leaving Trevor Rabin to finish Con Air) and had a very tight deadline. It's not the tinny, synthy sound of Speed anymore, he uses a HUGE orchestra which might be the only thing bigger and more bombastic than the actual premise of the movie. Really amazing stuff and it's most definitely worth hunting down the limited edition CD.There's a lot to like about Speed 2, and it doesn't deserve it's reputation. If you want mindless action, implausible set pieces, sunny scenery, and lots of destruction then look no further.",

But this is Speed II and not Speed. Because of my disappointment with the first movie, I wasn't too keen on seeing this one, but my brother hired it from the video store and basically I was pleasantly surprised. I approached this movie with a lot of cynicism and saw that it wasn't as bad as I though it was.Speed 2 wouldn't go on my list of all time best movies though as it was just average. The bad guy wasn't all that great. He was a computer programmer that was dying of some blood disease and was sacked because of that so he decided to hijack a ship to vent his frustration. It was similar to the bad guy in Speed who was upset with the fact that he didn't get much after retiring. The guy tries to make a statement but nobody is really interested in what he is saying and thus it doesn't make an impact. There is not tug of war between the bad guy and the corporation, and as far as I can see, the corporation was not attacked by anybody else because of their actions.Alex (Jason Patrick) was a far better hero because he had a noble side to him. He was a Swat officer and his when his girlfriend found out she wasn't too happy with that, but still, he had a much more noble side to him especially how he spends most of the movie trying to propose to her, and I felt for him when she blatantly says that she is not interested in a permanent relationship (before he has even asked her). I originally thought that Jason Patrick was simply replacing Keanu Reeves and remaining the same character, but I realised early on in the movie that this is not true.I guess the main thing I learnt from this movie this that it is not true that the sequel is always worse than the original.",

All the characters are pretty dull, and the story is routine, and not very interesting, even thought it did have a cool few action scenes. If Keanu returned for this sequel it would have been an entertaining ride for sure, and i thought the setting was cool, but it was just too bland to really work, plus the finale isn't that great in my opinion. Willem Dafoe is very good as the main villain, and Sandra Bullock did all that she could, however it's just not enough the action scenes try hard to be exciting when there just not, as it had me yearning for the original, however the ending was really cool.It actually starts of really well and i was thinking hey this might not be so bad, unfortunately it collapses in the 2nd half, due to the dull pace, over length and lack of charisma from Jason Patric, plus Bullock and Patric had no chemistry together. This is a boring and lifeless sequel that should have never been made, Jason Patric is no Keanu Reeves and makes a dull action hero, and Sandra Bullock is wasted!, don't bother with this sequel stick with the original!. The Directon isn't very good. Jan De Bont does not do a very good job here, with OK camera work, so so angles, and keeping the film at a bland pace. The Acting is mediocre. Jason Patric is below average here, he makes a very dull action hero, and is way too serious as well, he also had no chemistry with Bullock, and didn't convince me one bit, and looked bored in certain scenes, where's Keanu when you need him?. Sandra Bullock is not her usual amazing self, because she has barely anything to do, she is still stunningly gorgeous, and was still her likable perky self, it's just she's wasted, she did good with what she did though (Bullock Rules!!!!). Willem Dafoe is very good as the main villain, he is often creepy and very menacing, and is one of the film's lone bright spots. Temuera Morrison is good and adds some charisma as well i liked him. Rest of the cast are OK. Overall Don't bother with this one stick with the original!, which is one of the best Action films ever. * out of 5",

However,Mr Dafoe picked the wrong liner because Miss Bullock and Mr Patric were on board to foil his dastardly plan.

One of the first things he does is lock a nosy Cabin Steward in a cupboard.Now that doesn't necessarily make him a bad guy,but when he throws the Captain overboard he oversteps the mark a tad. \"Speed 2 - cruise control\" suffers in comparison to its \"ship in trouble\" contemporary \"Titanic\" on every front.Mr Di Caprio and Miss Winslet may be irritating to anyone over the age of consent but Miss Bullock and her beau have an annoyance factor that is off the scale.

Instead, Annie's new boyfriend Alex is chasing after the criminals who stole some computers.But eventually we do see what has to be, to the horror of the poor license examiner effectively played by Tim Conway, the worst road test in the history of driver's licenses. Wonderfully hilarious! And they even catch up with Alex.The movie gets off track briefly, but once Annie and Alex go on the cruise, things get better again. Alex and Annie's relationship ceases to be entertaining, but that's okay because John Geiger is upset over losing his golf clubs ... which are not merely golf clubs. And neither are his golf balls just golf balls. Things are about to get exciting! John Geiger worked for the company that designed computer systems for the cruise ship, but when he got sick they fired him, and he wants revenge. Once he sets out to take control of the ship (Get it? 'Cruise control'.) it is a non-stop thrill ride right to the end. And about the end: it's like Count Basie's 'April in Paris'.All I've ever heard about this movie is how bad it was. I didn't get that impression at all, although the slapstick ending of the cruise ship story was kind of weird and possibly inappropriate, given the fact that some people might have died or gotten seriously hurt (though we didn't see it). But I couldn't help but laugh.Willem Dafoe made an chilling and even borderline insane villain, though I have seen better. I liked the humorous way his character explained ending up on the ship's bridge. Sandra Bullock once again ended up reluctantly trying to save the day, and she did a nice job, even showing her funny side at times. Never again, though, was she as funny as when she took her driver's license test (Okay, once, but I have to leave some surprises).Several characters deserve mention: Drew, the adorable blonde 14-year-old who can't hear, manages to be quite a charmer without saying a word. Alex knows sign language and they have a cute conversation when they first meet. Later, Drew manages to get lost as things start happening, but she does a capable job of getting at least part of the way to safety. She does speak at several times, but with difficulty. There was also Dante, the annoying photographer. I wish we had seen more of him, though he did play a role in rescuing the others and preventing disaster, and, while he wasn't funny in those situations, he was okay.There were a couple of other characters I liked but I didn't catch their names. One seemed to be like Gopher on 'The Love Boat' and he not only couldn't seem to do anything right, but he encountered all sorts of bad luck throughout the movie. I mean more than the passengers and crew in general. Also, there was the captain of the boat at the Caribbean resort. Now there was a character!

            "content": "Says one stricken passenger towards the end of the film. Easy love: you're a cardboard character in a derivative sequel that was purely made to cash in on the far superior original film.I decided to watch this film after having heard some awful reviews about it together with some midway reviews, so I was not expecting much, but considered that the negative reviews might be a bit harsh. Unfortunately, I was wrong: this film is utterly deserving of its poor reputation.Sadly, the absence of Keanu Reeves is felt from the offset; not only is Jason Patric a poor substitute, providing a male lead who real is indistinguishable from everyone else but, even worse, Reeves's absence makes it clear that Sandra Bullock's Annie is an extremely irritating character who really cares only for herself. From my perspective, it made me wonder just how tolerable the original \"Speed\" would have been without Reeves in the lead role. Oh well, at least he had the good sense to jump ship with this film (since Patric's character was clearly meant to be Reeves's character, Jack), whilst Jack was saved the utter turmoil of spending any more time with Annie than he had to.The plot on the cruise ship plods along interminably in parts with no one really caring about the vessel or its passengers or crew. Whereas \"Speed\" skilfully made you care about its characters - even the minor ones - \"Speed 2: Cruise Control\" is a very cluttered film and it is extremely hard to like the characters, even the ones that we know. Sadly, Lois Chiles, a great actress in her own right and one time Bond Girl (from \"Moonraker\") gets pulled into the slipstream of this rolling nuisance of a film. Indeed, the film's most embarrassing moment comes around when Chiles's onscreen daughter, a 15-year-old deaf girl offers herself to Patric's character.For a long time, the most likeable characters in the film were Annie's driving instructor and Willem Dafoe's nutball until Mr Nutball became that bit too cartoonish in his approach. After that, I gave a big sigh of relief when Glenn Plummer who was the memorable \"Jaguar Owner\" in \"Speed\" made a welcome return in a similar situation.Whereas \"Speed\" was just that and tailored its action sequences with that in mind, \"Speed 2\" is truly unworthy of that title. Case in point: an \"action\" sequence towards the end of the film that involves the cruise ship very, very slowly lumbering towards an immovable object. Hardly the high octane action on the highways, airport runways and subways of Los Angeles from the original film...The film did pick up admirably towards its conclusion, which was when this film finally started to seem similar to \"Speed\".Nevertheless, I cannot deny that I was relieved when the film was over!Thankfully a third film was not made. If it ever is, the filmmakers should ignore this entry and give us more Keanu Reeves.",

I usually don't find action movies very interesting anyway (and I really dislike de Bont) but I genuinely enjoyed Speed (the original) despite its faults. It just worked. In this sequel, de Bont basically took the EXACT SAME PLOT and moved it to a boat. C'mon. In Speed 2, the lovely but dull Bullock trembles and stutters and screams, \"Are you crazy? Are you insane?\" fifty times before leaping in to help save the cruise ship. Her boyfriend, Patric, is the absolute most boring and unemotional actor I've ever seen, and that includes Keanu Reeves. (Whom, by the way, I gained a good deal of respect for after learning that he'd declined the idiotic role in Speed 2!) This movie would have been a lot better--though I guess it would have been over faster--if the people involved were intelligent enough to get off a boat once in a while. There's an oil tanker involved in the film, and the cruise ship approaches it for about half an hour while the people on the oil tanker panic and run around in circles despite being maybe 100 feet from land. Jump off the boat, you morons. Even the people on the cruise ship spend the movie acting as if they're sailing across hot lava or something. De Bont throws in some bit about how they'll get sucked into the propellers if they jump into the water, but there are plenty of opportunities to do so. The ship stops, the ship slows down, etc.When it smashes through a resort town, crushing condos, the people there are leaping out of the way at the last second--what the hell? How did they all somehow manage to not notice this cruise liner bearing down on them at 5 knots (which is slightly less than 6 mph?) I gave this 2 stars instead of one because it was on a boat, and I like boats. Otherwise, I'd have rather watched Family Guy's predictions for Speed 3.

            "content": "My Take: A much-maligned sequel to the highly-successful SPEED has none of that film's thrills, but it ain't as bad as most say it is. Movies during the summer don't depend themselves much on smart, clever situations and characters, and SPEED 2: CRUISE CONTROL is no exception. This maybe it's year's dumbest action flick, with everything happening implausible overdrive. Yes, it is dumb, but when it comes to its action sequences and tight pacing, SPEED 2 is a \"could-be-worse\" summer fun, as long as audiences expect less than more from the writer's intelligence. Having said that, the movie does have its share of huge problems and plot holes that could sink the Titanic. Instead of a traveling Los Angeles bus, SPEED 2 takes the danger to a Caribbean cruise liner. Sandra Bullock returns to her lovable role of Annie Porter from the first SPEED, with much less to do, rather than the usual damsel-in-distress behavior. She goes with her boyfriend Alex (Jason Patric), an LAPD, lacking the heroic charm of Keanu Reeves' Jack Traven role, on a Caribbean cruise on board the Seaborn Legend. Unlucky for them, and for the other passengers, to board a ship with John Geiger (Willem Dafoe) on board. See, he's a crazed computer engineer with vengeance, after being fired when he gets a certain ailment, he believes, came from a technical malfunction of the ship, which he helped control. After he takes over the ship, he sends it speeding towards an oil tanker at a rush. This gives time for Patric to flex his action muscles, while also giving Bullock a chance to say her distressful dialogs like \"I swear, I'm never leaving the house again!\".Director Jan De Bont is back on the fast lane (if i may say so) directing this sequel to his summer hit. This time, though, he doesn't do very great job, unlike that he did for the first film. De Bont uses a lot of the \"Shakycam\", shots that follow the action sequences, but gives the viewer a dizzy feeling. He gives these treatments, even to moments that don't require them. The plot, of course, is highly preposterous and implausible. Firstly, no ship moves at an incredibly fast like how it was pointed out in the story. Once more, we also get a dull dose of characters, a lot less colorful and busy like the ones in SPEED. The film loses a lot, basically, from the lack of Keanu Reeves' character, and Patric's isn't much of a good replacement. Bullock's role here isn't quite as charming as how she did the character in the first film. The only character that has much dimension is Dafoe's Geiger, but he seems way too over-the-top to be any plausible than a comic book villain.Nevertheless, despite all the flaws, SPEED 2 manages to make a thrill ride of itself. The special-effects take on a life of its own during the film's better action sequences. My favorite, is the ship's collision with the giant oil tanker, which is where the bigger-budgeted effects are best observed. De Bont, despite his tired and uninspired direction, manages to produce a couple of good moments.Perhaps as long as the audience doesn't think even once the moment the theater lights have dimmed, SPEED 2: CRUISE CONTROL might be worth a look, but with so many flaws and gaps in reality, it doesn't even come close to what it could have been. Stick to the original; at least Keanu Reeves was smart enough to do that. Rating: ** out of 5.",

            "content": "That's not a quote from Willem Dafoe, but what the cinema manager came and said to me during the screening of this film. Yet Speed 2 is perhaps an unfairly derided sequel, particularly in regard to its predecessor.For 90% of negative comments surrounding this movie are comparisons with the 1994 original. Most of these points are, however, without foundation. Take criticism of Jason Patric for a start. Okay, a man with a receding hairline might be a daring choice for heroic lead, but slating him for wooden acting? I admit he's not the most expressive of men, but the original starred Keanu Reeves, for goodness' sake! And where Dennis Hopper admitted at an awards ceremony that his villain had \"no motivation whatsoever\", Willem Dafoe's blood-infected victim does at least have a purpose for his actions.That's perhaps where the reappraisal ends. In the annals of villainy, a golf fanatic is unlikely to feature. Sandra Bullock's limited role is almost entirely reactionary, and her trademark \"kookiness\" (TM) is overdone and perfunctory, like most of the humour on display. And as the \"Cruise Control\" subtitle tells us, a boat is hardly the place for fast-paced action.The functionality and patronising blandness of the dialogue soon starts to wear as thin as Patric's hair, and clock-watching becomes a necessity. Gratuitous musical cameos scream desperation (didn't UB40 have a career before they starred in this?), while a racial stereotype is tagged on the end to desperately add some pep to proceedings. Also look out for a bizarre \u0096 and irrelevant \u0096 subplot involving a deaf girl.I wonder what the producers thought when they saw the finished product? \"Man the lifeboats!\" couldn't have been far from their minds. I actually found this almost entertaining the first time round and watched it again with a positive redress in mind. However, time, distance, and common sense have worked their magic on me, and so I now cheerfully admit that this film is a complete pile of pants.",

A vehicle is hijacked out of control and our heroes (I COULDN'T FINISH TYPING THAT WITHOUT LAUGHING), some \"characters\" have to stop a vehicle before it crashes.

The acting in this \"film\" is nothing short of a joke from all of the actors and actresses. However, the best of the worst is Willem Dafoe as the villain, John Geiger. Once again, here we have a garbage \"movie\" where the best character is the villain. I don't know whether to call that a good thing or a bad thing. All of the other actors and actresses were just abysmal with their performances, especially Sandra Bullock. You've probably guessed already that I'm not a big fan of Sandra Bullock. She's had a couple of good performances in other films, but overall, she's a terrible actress. Finally, the soundtrack is just your average action soundtrack, with absolutely nothing to write home about. Now for the positives, yes, even this waste of a \"movie\" does have positives. All of the sets/locations are nice, and give the \"film\" a decent atmosphere. The other positive is the special effects, they are all well-done and still hold up today. \"Speed 2: Cruise Control\" is nothing but a worthless diarrhea stain that should have never been made.

            "content": "The original Speed was a fun, wild ride that exploited a great gimmick of a bomb-wired runaway bus, terrific chemistry between leads Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock and managing to peak on a variety of action fronts. It was a given that there would be a sequel, but did it have to be this stinking inept? Wags bad-mouthed Reeves for backing out of the sequel, but the world owes him an apology. First, the sequel is just plain lame-brained and lacks any sense of fun or suspense that characterized the original film. The gimmick of a runaway cruise ship on a collision course with an oil tanker just never seems especially riveting and the ridiculous way that many of the passengers get trapped aboard the ship, including the lead duo, never makes much sense. Willem Dafoe turns out to be a poor substitute for Dennis Hopper as the villain of the piece - a disgruntled computer hacker with lead poisoning (or something) that require the administration of leeches. Anyone who thinks Reeves cannot act at all needs to explain how it is possible for him to have succeeded so well in the first film, whereas Jason Patric - his woebegone replacement in the sequel and widely considered a far better actor than Reeves - is completely at sea. Patric is not charismatic or dynamic, shares zero chemistry with his leading lady and comes across as lumpish. And speaking of Bullock, why has her charming character from the original been re-imagined into a ditzy, incompetent, nagging boob? The opening and closing comedy sequences where Bullock attempts to regain her driver's license with beleaguered driving instructor Tim Conway is played for laughs, but it is inappropriately ludicrous with its broad comedy, and it would have us believe that the expert driver handling the out-of-control bus from Speed has devolved into a total dithering idiot behind the wheel. The first dialog scene between the leads is a hint of things to come with Bullock discovering by accident that Patric (who wants to marry her) is - horrors! - a cop who faces danger every day like her prior boyfriend. Apparently Bullock's Annie has become so timid, she cannot handle any relationships involving stress...good luck on that one! If the writing is tragic, then the direction is on the same level. Returning director Jan DeBont cannot come up with so much as one memorable action sequence in the whole shebang. Trust me when I say save your money and watch the original a second time.",

            "content": "Whoever pitched the idea for a \"Speed\" sequel on a boat must have been out of his or her mind. One of the most derided film sequels in cinematic history, it has rightfully earned its infamous reputation for being so rotten (look at the 3% rating on Rotten Tomatoes). Missing the high octane thrills from the first film as well as charismatic leading man Keanu Reeves in one of his best roles as Jack Traven, the film was doomed from the minute the cameras started rolling (or maybe from the moment the script was finished?). Set sometime after the events of the first film, \"Cruise Control\" introduces a new lead character in the form of Jason Patric's Alex Murphy, an LAPD officer, who is now dating Sandra Bullock's Annie from the original \"Speed (what exactly happened with Annie and Jack is unclear)\". The two set off for a Caribbean cruise when a deranged former software engineer (Willem Dafoe) hijacks the ship and sets a course for disaster. As per action movie clich\u00e9, it's up to Alex and Annie to stop the madman's reign of terror. Replacing Keanu Reeves's Jack Traven is a terribly unconvincing Jason Patric as Alex Murphy. The actor, who was more known for his teen roles in the 1980s, is clearly not suited to helm an action sequel that was blatantly written to have Reeves in the hot seat. Patric is visibly uncomfortable throughout the film as his expressions range from boredom to forced and bland attempts at sweetness towards Sandra Bullock's Annie and his beyond lack of \"action hero\" bravado to stop Dafoe's character's antics. Thankfully on the part of the absent original lead, Reeves had dropped out to pursue his short-lived music career. However attempting to follow up his success with a horrible replacement cop and supposed hero was the first nail in the coffin as you really hope Alex will go down with the ship (along with the other poor souls who got suckered in).Gone is the reluctant heroine in Sandra Bullock's original portrayal of Annie in \"Speed\". Now we are subjected to a much whinier and annoying caricature of her former self. Bullock had a few moments of being a nuisance in the original film, but here in \"Cruise Control\" the actress is insufferable. At the beginning she is portrayed in a more dim- witted and slightly less annoying light but enter Jason Patric and we get an Annie who is perpetually nagging and whiny. Even when she is eventually taken hostage by the villain of the piece, it is impossible to root for a chance at Annie's escape or Alex to rescue her as we don't have much sympathy for either character. Spoiler: she gets away and does reunite with her boring love interest. And luckily Sandra now refuses to do sequels thanks to this train-wreck.The film's solely enjoyable performance in this schlock-fest is the delightfully insane Willem Dafoe, hamming it up as much as he can. Playing an intelligent villain with the typical action movie madman complex, the actor doesn't fail to be entertaining despite being far above to material he is given. Dafoe brings his usual manic glee to the part and is clearly enjoying himself as he wreaks havoc aboard the slowing moving vessel. Despite some horrible dialogue and the movie clich\u00e9 of explaining why he is doing what he is doing, it's just too much fun to watch the crazed actor just relish chewing the scenery and showing up the awful performances of the other actors. It is relatively easy to only root for his maniacal villain to win and just end the movie quickly from its awful cheese-factor. Sadly the film did earn the respected character actor and Oscar nominee a Razzie for Worst Supporting Actor; Dafoe thankfully lost and his career remains intact. The script is just all over the place in this sequel as we wait little over two hours for the boat to crash and eventually see the baddie meet his demise. The relationship between the leads (Alex and Annie) is virtually non-existent unlike the first film. Action clich\u00e9s are abundant and uninspired. Director Jan de Bont barely brings anything new to the table that impresses; I will credit him for trying to deliver another solid villain in Willem Dafoe's Geiger which does succeed in a fashion due to his casting choice. This film is admittedly a guilty pleasure for me due to its villainous lead and just ridiculing the awfulness.If you loved the original \"Speed\" best to stay away from this turkey unless you're curious about its infamous reputation for the worst film sequel ever.",

As a result, the action sequences in this movie are far-fetched, boring and unintentionally funny. Which is in a way a good thing, because the INTENTIONAL humour in this movie is, well, terrible. To top it all of, the special effects look like the budget for them was about $ 12,75. To wrap it all up, this is a terrible, terrible movie that should be avoided at all costs. NO stars",

But I will say one thing: With a garbage script the cinematographer, the editor and director De Bont NEARLY manages to save the day. They create a hairraising last 30 minutes with a major norwegian cruise ship (OK, I couldn't help mention it seeing as I'm from Norway myself).

The editing in this at times especially in the middle of the film is not good. The cinematography is very uneven at times. And the pacing absolutely feels terrible. The plot is very farfetched as well. Terrible Action Movie Overall.",

            "content": "OK, this is a sequel, and it is not a great sequel, we agree on that. But is it THAT bad? It has ratings far below worse movies in the same genre.Let's look at the \"right\" it does:ONE VILLAIN. Just like Speed, but also like Dirty Harry, Alien and Predator, it focuses on a SINGLE villain. That is a great idea. No faceless target villains thrown in for some cheap action, focus on one.BIG CHANGES WHEN MAKING A SEQUEL: Bigger, but also different! It worked for Aliens, Die Hard 2 and Predator 2!IMPRESSIVE SPECIAL EFFECTS: This movie has spectacular specials! I had to wonder how much was real and how much was models.YOU DON'T HAVE TO FIGHT VILLAINS TO GET ACTION: In much of the action, the heroes are fighting the environment and not the villain.COMIC SIDEKICKS: There are some characters that clearly are intended to be funny. (No, they were not very funny but they tried... a bit.)SAVE THE KIDS: We care about kids. Just think about Aliens. (That is part of why we hated when Newt was written out of Alien 3. We loved to see her making it.) This is clearly included here, and the deaf girl idea is pretty nice.This doesn't look like a bad sequel at all, not on paper. Obviously it went wrong, it flopped. Why? I think it is bad timing, uninteresting dialogue, uninteresting romantic side story, weak directing... So all the good things just weren't assembled to a great whole.But I can list a couple of much, much worse action movies with much better ratings, movies that left me with a stronger feeling of wasted time and dull plot, B- movies on AAA budget, just like this.So did I waste my time? Well, I certainly could have watched a better movie, but it was not a rating 1 movie. Just another dull popcorn movie. A typical movie for a rating at 4-6 somewhere.",

The score like the first one is very good. Everyone is saying how bad it is, well I didn't get that impression at all. My favorite scene is when the unstoppable ship goes beyond the ocean and onto the road, where no ship ever goes. I wondered why they didn't evacuate everybody then sink the ship or blow it up before the bad guy could ever do.This movie has some amazing shots, like the shot where the anchor side swipes the ship , tearing it from the outside in. Or a nighttime shot showing the ship, it was very pretty.I love Drew, she's so cute and I like how she liked Alex and told him she loved him. Even as a young girl that's important and really added a sweet touch to the movie.All in all, in terms of sequels go, this one is pretty good, it's a favorite.",

The fact that the bomb is gonna explode inside a boat doesn't change the path of destruction we're used to see. A boat can do a lot of damage, that's what I know now!

What we have here is a heartbreaking story about a zany cybernut (Dafoe) on a warpath to insanity because of some injustice or whatever done to him in his former sane life. He hijacks a cruise liner filled with comical cannon fodder, so that he may acquire some invaluable diamonds for his evil schemes (???). On the good guys side, we have token black guy, moronic crew, bad acting LAPD cop-person (Patric) no one's going to ever hear from again, and Sandra Bullock on her worst day... all of whom are equally worthless in this script. There's really no development or story which is sort of hilarious. All we get are Dafoe's wacky and zany antics and LAPD cop-person pretending to be smart and clever while Bullock whines and grunts every now and then as a reminder that there are other important cast members in this monstrosity.

After watching it, one of my expectations came true, it was bigger but not better.Speed 2 (Spoilers******) Sequel to the original 1994 action blockbuster, Dutch director Jan de Bont comes again to tell another thrilling chapter after a three year gap. For the first film the studio was not sure whether this foreign film director can carry a different action movie, but after its unexpected success, 20th Century Fox studio makes his return in a bigger way and in a different canvas.But things went wrong there, first of all absence of writer Graham Yost and even Joss Whedon, they got replaced by new writers. Resulted a script originally intended to be a installment for the Die Hard Series. Knowing this Keanu Reeves turned down the project and accepted a much more respected film called \"The Devil's Advocate\".But Fox was well set for this sequel, making a sudden rewrites in the script the story begins with Annie Porter (Sandra Bullock), the troubled civilian from the last movie falling in love with a new cop, Officer Alex Shaw (Jason Patric). They go for a dating on a cruiser ship but things went wrong when the bad man John Geiger (Willem \"Green Goblin\" Dafoe) tries to control the 'speeding' ship.Scripted by Randall McCormick and Jeff Nathanson for the story of Jan de Bont and Randall McCormick themselves, brings this second thrilling experience. In fact I enjoyed the movie (I thought Keanu Reeve's original character, officer Jack Traven was re-casted by Jason Patric!), but major thing missing was those tight tensions, over the edge shots. Surely it came bigger, from a bus to a size of Ship, from road to the deep sea. But the producers failed to create those extreme circumstances.Even so, the soul created for this movie from Mark Mancina and Christopher Ward tried to connect the sequel to its original. Mancina's score tried to flesh out the excitement like the action scenes on the speeding bus, however major portions of the sequel suffer from arrhythmic, more dissonant cues. Sandra Bullock in the other hand didn't know what to do, whether she has to reinvent the character or go on with the same stage, she was totally lost in establishing her role in the sequel.All in all it's a great movie if you didn't see the original.

What were that Dante- guy and the deaf girl doing there, except being annoying?Sandra Bullock was fine as Annie, but Jason Patric can't let us forget Keanu Reeves.If there will ever be a Speed 3 (which I doubt after the disappointing box office gross this one made), please pay at least a little attention to the script.",

But you were young then and this was your first lesson about the cautions one must take where sequels are concerned. Some stories just need to be left told. When they chose to replace the star character with another (played by an actor who was unintentionally and so incredibly upstaged by Sandra Bullock); when they replaced a speeding bus with a BOAT, completely undermining the whole concept, further adding insult to the title's singled-worded zinger...suspicions should have been raised. Maybe then this sadly disappointing flop wouldn't have stung so much. Fortunately, after the hurt subsided, you realized the movie was so incredibly estranged from the original in almost every possible way, that you'd subconsciously come to regard it as it's own entirely separate film. And you've moved on happily regarding 'Speed' as ONE of the greatest action flicks of its time. And that other film with a similar title is completely forgotten save for the part about you having seen it once.But I say, if you haven't seen it already, save yourself the emotional steps it will take to find happiness again and just give the first one another watch.

Basic Plot- Sandra Bullock and Jason Patric (Keanu Reeves turned it down) go for a cruise trip. Predictably it is hijacked by a crazed maniac. Cue many explosions etc. along the lines of every terrorist film. Ever.Speed 2 offers nothing new. It travels the same path as Die Hard, Under Siege etc. and every set piece can be seen from a mile off. Patric and Bullock do their best- the film's failure is not down to them, more to the appalling script they have to deal with and the sheer unoriginality of the movie.Speed 2 should be avoided, unless you are determined to see every example of its genre, or are compiling an 'All-Time Worst' list.

The male lead (Jason Patric) is as believable as an action cop, as it would be to watch a 2 year old fly the Concorde. Sandra Bulldog is annoying beyond hope, due to the characters exaggerated amount of stupidity. The rest of the cast, is just bland and as memorable as a rainy Monday. The only two members of the cast that I find the slightest bit interesting are Christine Firkins and Susan Barnes. The plot, well, it's a ship out of control. The main problem with this is, that the director and producer did not take the time to make it believable. There are so many technical errors in this, it's ridiculous. They did not take the time to find out, how a cruise liner works and that way could have eliminated the ways of stopping the ship in a believable fashion. These technical plot holes just go on and on through the entire movie and ends with the biggest blunder ever.

For me, this movie really stepped up the plot from the first Speed, with some truly dramatic scenes (lifeboat evacuation) and some quality disaster moments (oil tanker collision). Willem Dafoe's character is interesting, and he plays a classic villain. I also found Sandra Bullocks uninspiring yet satirical attitude not cheesy or ridiculous, but somewhat amusing.

All of those ones I mentioned are awesome, fun and full of excitement.This isn't the case with \"Speed 2\". \"Speed 2\" got panned by critics for all the right reasons and years later, this film is still a mess. It deserves to get hated for many reasons, especially since it takes place on a slow moving cruise ship instead of something fast like an airplane (I'd recommend you see \"Air Force One\" instead) or a train.Anyway, Keanu Reeves was smart enough to refuse to return to this abomination and star in \"The Devil's Advocate\" and tour with his band Dogstar. Every actor that was offered a substitute for Keanu Reeves did the right thing by starring in other films and Gary Oldman was smart to turn down the offer to play Willem Dafoe's character to star in \"Air Force One\".Jason Patric's character is wooden and so are the other characters. There are many pointless and awkward scenes including at the end where a bus that looks similar to the one from the first film pops up out of nowhere and Sandra Bullock's character says \"Sorry! That bus was going way too fast.\" Is that to keep the film in good continuity?At least there were no plans for a \"Speed 3\".",

If they were looking for a way to explain Keanu's absence in this sequel, they really could have done better.  Especially since her new boyfriend is even more extreme than Jack.Speed was an excellent action film, with some nice acting and a great plot to boot.  Speed 2 makes an excellent attempt at a follow-up, but with plot problems like the above and acting that is, from everyone but Sandra Bullock, not nearly on the level of Speed, it just doesn't have the appeal of the original.After the excellence of the Speed, Speed 2 is a real disappointment.  Oh, its still a good film in its own right, but when compared to the first it really is just a drab copy.  While there is a good amount of humor, many of the jokes are just restatements of the jokes from the original.  Much like the entire plot, which is largely the same, except that they use a boat this time instead of a bus.  There ARE other things that the word \"Speed\" could suggest, guys.Like I said, though, it is still a good film.  It just falls short of the original, despite the fact that it is very obvious that everyone was trying their best.  Speed was a sort of miracle combination of acting, plot, and stunts that just doesn't happen twice, but Speed 2 does a good job trying. Watch it.",

Like all sequels comparisons will be made to the original but the only link to 'Speed' is Sandra Bullock. This film is more reminicient of 'Under Siege' and 'The Poseidon Adventure' than it's namesake. Bullock is now dating Jason Patric (after she dumped Keanu Reeves) and he takes her onto a cruise ship - hoping to propose to her. On board is Willem DeFoe - a disgruntled ex-employee of the cruise liner company who is now terminally ill - now seeks revenge. The Captain is killed, the ship shudders and the passengers panic. Most of the passengers escape via lifeboats but those few (including a deaf girl who didn't hear the sirens) remain on board - the ship now bound for an oil tanker. It is up to resourseful Bullock and hunky Patric to save the day. Bullock plays her usual spunky self in this film. Patric (who has never been in a \"commercial\" film since 'The Lost Boys') plays the heroic role admirably. Willem DeFoe sneers constantly. Temuera Morrison (last seen in 'Once Were Warriors'), Lois Chiles ('Evil Under The Sun', 'Sweet Liberty') and Colleen Camp ('Die Hard With A Vengeance' They All Laughed', ' Wayne's World') offer support as crew and passengers who remain on the doomed ship.

Neither does it take 15 seconds to pull hundreds of meters of anchor chain out of the water, more likely 45 minutes... Furthermore, it is impossible to hold a mooring rope under hard pulling force with only one turn on the nock... Also, trying to stop a revolving 18 tonne propeller under the influence of an 25-30.000 horsepower machine is like stopping a runaway train with a shoestring... Last, since there will be no air to breath within 10-15 seconds after a haloon system is set of, you can only launch it, after a long alarm, from a separate location....

Added to that the fact that you didn't have the majour hero star, well, it was pretty impossible. Yet, the producers decided to soldier on.  They got a new hero, and Sandra Bullock, and they made a go of it.  It's not brilliant, but let's face it, I don't think they we're trying to be brilliant.  Frankly, I believe that the largest problem with this movie is that it tried to be a sequel to the first movie.  Also, it was on water, which had been done to death e.g. The Poseidon Adventure, Under Siege, one of the Airport movies, etc.  Strictly as a stand-alone feature, it may've done better without referring to the original.  Mind you, maybe it would've been better as a direct-to-video feature.  Looking at it strictly by itself, I liked it, but I've been known to like crappy movies in my day.  I certainly wouldn't rate it higher than a 5 out of 10.  It's no Speed, and it's not even worthy of being a sequel to Speed, but it's got its merits.

When you walk into the theater or put the movie in your VCR, if you haven't seen it before, you're already wondering.\"Speed 2\" doesn't do that.

            "content": "When I first saw the original Speed, I didn't know it had a sequel. When I heard about Speed 2: Cruise Control, it wasn't long before I also heard from people who'd seen it that the first film had a better storyline. I agree - a cruise ship isn't as fast as a bus but I wouldn't be so hard on Speed 2.The opening to the film is great and Alex's speeding entrance in the motorbike chase is fun to watch. I also find Annie retaking her driving test very funny. I think couples going to away together can be a great way for them to get to know each other. The Seaboard Legend is a beautiful cruise ship and I love the panning shot and the music when the ship is first seen. I like the vacation feel of Speed 2 and the onboard entertainment is fantastic. My Dad liked boats and ships and when I first saw Speed 2, my Dad saw it as well and he did not compare it to the first Speed at all. In fact, Speed 2 was a big hit with my Dad!I love the onboard entertainers and Tamia's performance of \"Make Tonight Beautiful\" is wonderful. There are some scenes where the Seaboard Legend isn't as slow-moving as some have said. Willem Dafoe is well-cast as the villain John Geiger. Unlike the first film, the villain's motive is more clearly explained - by the villain himself. I felt sorry for the Captain when Geiger threw him overboard and the crew when they'd lost control of the ship. When I first saw Speed 2, the cruise ship closing in on the offshore oil tanker was tense, as was Geiger taking Annie hostage. Poor Annie - twice in two films! I was glad that Alex and Dante found a way to turn the ship using the bow thrusters to avoid a head-on collision that would've destroyed the oil tanker and the cruise ship.The sequence where the Seaboard Legend smashes through the boats and crashes into the island is great to watch and my Dad really enjoyed it. The ship finally stopped at the bell tower. For quite some time, I wondered how the filmmakers had a whole cruise ship crash into an island - until I read Wikipedia and discovered that it was only a full scale replica bow and a collapsible town set, but it's fun to watch!I think Maurice making an appearance in this film (after his car was hijacked in the first film) is a positive and Alex hijacking his boat makes me laugh every time! The chase after Geiger's seaplane does well, as does Geiger's end when he crashes the seaplane into a tower on the oil tanker - which explodes spectacularly. I think that's more classic than Payne's end. I'm pleased Maurice picked up the bag containing the multi-million jewellery collection. Also, unlike the first film, Alex proposes to Annie - and she accepts on the condition that she makes the travel plans from now on. The camera pans out from the island and I'm amazed every time that an entire cruise ship has ended up there. Don't worry about Seaboard Legend. She'll be repaired and will be back on the seas again for more great cruises.Annie retaking her driving test again certainly ends the film on a comic note. The bus that speeds past is identical to the one in Speed. Maybe it's the same bus. Maybe that bus was rebuilt and is back on the roads again. Annie said that bus was going way too fast. I think it was going at more than 50mph.Although Speed 2: Cruise Control may not be as thrilling as Speed, here's 2 positives: Speed 2 made more than its budget and the ship crashing into the island set records as the largest and most expensive stunt ever filmed.I was interested to discover that Speed 2 was originally going to be a Die Hard film. I think that fact is worth exploring - what if Speed 2 had been a Die Hard film instead? It may have done well at the Box Office. I can imagine John McClane taking a vacation on a cruise ship but some bad guys are also on board and they take over the ship, hold the passengers hostage and set the ship on a cruise for destruction. However, McClane saves the day - and the ship.I heard the Seaboard Legend is now called the Star Legend. I would like a nice cruise someday.",

Why do the ship get flooded when they open the ballast tanks? To enter a ballast tank off a ship you have to enter a man-hole that is sealed with a hatch and many bolts... It's not open like a big door... Btw, you can't just sink a ship with filling the ballast tanks.2. I have never seen a wheel on the thruster that you can turn and make the propeller turn. Most thrusters are electric so i find this hard to believe... correct me if i am wrong.3. At the end of the movie when they are hitting other vessels they slow down by 1knot every time while the main engine is still running at full. Even if the engine was off the ship would not have lost that much speed of a small impact like that. The ship weight is 9,961 GT so it would take much more to slow a ship like that.4. Yes you can lower the lifeboats when the ship is moving.All in all it's just to stupid.",

Surprisingly, nobody does anything.And since the trailer gives everything away, strangely, when they crash up against the oil tanker or when they crash into land, NOBODY hangs on to anything. They all fall over onto objects, therefore increasing the injury rate on the ship. Also, there are annoying crew members all over the ship. Even if you stay in your cabin, they WILL find you....The directing was good, screenplay bad, and music good.I wouldn't be surprised if Seabourn lost some money after this...",

The story line is totally unbelievable, full of cliches, the characters got NO depth whatsoever, and it's just plain boring. The action scenes is unrealistic to the point of despair.

She and her boyfriend, an LA SWAT team member, are taking a cruise to get away from it all. In this sequel she once again picks a doomed vehicle to travel in. Willem Dafoe is a disgruntled former cruise line employee determined for revenge with his golf clubs and balls hiding bomb materials, something I've not seen before. There is plenty of action and some fine special effects.

The part when the cruise liner is about to crash into the oil ship is by far not as thrilling as a bus trying to jump a missing part of a bridge like in Speed.Willem Dafoe acts like an idiot, but did a pretty good job, I liked how they put a Scotsman and a Kiwi in the cast as one of the crew of the cruise liner, but Jason Patric shows us why many of us had probably never heard of him beofre this movie. He's just a bad actor, especially as the hero-type guy. Sandra Bullock remained herself from Speed, which made at least one main character act decent in a otherwise awful movie.Last but not least, When the Cruise Liner crashed into that town on the water front, well that looked sooooooooo increddibly fake, or did they really spend most of the $100 million on that scenario?, and one last thing, it was funny to see that jamaican dude who gets his car and cell phone destroyed by Keanu Reeves in Speed, this time gets some damage to his boat and fishing line and interupted while on a date by Jason Patric.",

What kind of retarded individual acts in such a behaviour when she is taking her driving test as Ms Bullock.Surely that was worthy of an arrest in itself.Next we move on to a cruise ship where supposedly Bullock and Patric are taking a vacation so that the two can work their problems out and get to know each other better.  Throughout the rest of the movie God only knows why Patric didn't throw Bullock overboard for the simple reason as to get her to shut the hell up.The film could have been some what better had they not billed it as a sequel to Speed.  Take away Bullock and the numerous plot holes and there is just a hint (and I meen a hint) of an OK action movie.  When I say plot holes, I of course use examples such as turning a ship to avoid an oil tanker that turns enough to avoid the head on collision and then fails to keep turning. People flying through glass windows when the ship slows by a knot.  Crashing into yaughts and pedaloes which help the ship slow down enormously.  That kind of thing.I am personally a big action film fan and am normally very happy to shut my mind down and watch great scenes that involve explosions, special fx and mindless killing but not even I could oversee the disasterous attempt that this film produced.Avoid if at all possible.",

I don't know...something about hacking a cruise ship? At least, you probably know about the movie. This is one of the worst bombs and worst sequels of all time because there are 3 things this movie is a bumbarded waste:\r 1. Bad casting choices.\r2. the story is terrible, can't even stay loyal to the infamous bomb on a bus scene from the 94 version.\r3. Lack of character development, not enough hype, and a ridiculous soundtrack with only reggae music.\r Sure, the film was a success at the box office, but we don't care anymore. I definitely want to see a reboot of the film anytime soon. Any director who is capable of bringing back the moments I love about the original version, it's gotta be a fair and very successful director like David Fincher.

Disgraceful! A good example of a horrible sequel. You can tell EXACTLY why Keanu turned it down and rejected Speed 2 even though he was offered a $12 million paycheck. Just watch the entire film and you'll see why: it's flat out boring and lame. Unnecessary sequel. For me, that was a very wise move, Keanu! I would totally give him the props (bro fist) and five thumbs up, not for ditching Jan and Sandra but for criticizing the film's plot, setting and script. He knows what a horrible, **** sequel is when he sees it. Even if Keanu returned as Jack, he would truly shine as Jack but that's not enough to save this movie. You're better off watching the first film. Great decision Keanu! You truly deserve a raise! Jason Patrick, although he does do his best to shine as Annie's new policeman fianc\u00e9, let's face it: NOBODY, not even Jason can replace Keanu's role (no offence). Jack has just the right facial appearance and the right amount of mischief in his eyes to be a born heroic cop. He's the MAN! Although Sandra, Willem and director Jan try to prevent this already waterlogged sequel from sinking to the bottom of the ocean by inserting some twists and turns, a few action sequences and some laughable dialogue, the biggest flop of this sequel is the lack of thrill with a slow-moving cruise ship rather than a fast, wired-for-explosive-destruction bomb laden city bus zooming above 50 MPH through the streets of Los Angeles and ending up at the airport. Even when the ship crashes into a beach town of Saint Martin bringing it to a halt, look at how slow the ship is, even at full speed. It BARELY damaged the area. I mean, look at the substantial amount of deceleration in this film. It was slower and poorer, like a garbage truck or by watching paint dry. As soon as Kenau declined to reprise his role as Jack, Sandra (as Annie) should have followed. The director Jan could have done a better job at the plot line and setting like have Daniel Payne (Howard's son) avenge his father's death by rigging a huge C4 in the cargo area of a Boeing 737 that Jack, his wife Annie and their two sons are flying on vacation to Hawaii activate if it accelerates above 185 knots and ascends above 2300 feet (the captain or first officer gets injured leaving the other pilot to fly the plane with Jack and Annie assisting him. After ALL the hostages parachute to safety from the moving plane, the out of fuel Boeing 737 nosedives into the ground. Jack, Mac and Annie continue to defeat Daniel using a slightly different scam than from the first film. After Jack, Mac and Annie kill Daniel, they all head home into the sunset or eat pizza in a restaurant. That's more like what the plot should have been; on a fast moving vehicle, with Keanu and Sandra's characters married (they make such an adorable couple) and a few newcomer child actors for the two sons. This flopped sequel just killed the speed film franchise. I doubt there will ever be a Speed 3 (Keanu declined the possibility of a third film) and if there is and reunites Keanu and Sandy, I just hope they can still maintain their young looks from the '90s. Annie's character is significantly reduced here. Also, Glenn Plummer, Joe Morton and Sandra Bullock are the only ones to reprise. Jan should have abandoned the project for a sequel when Reeves quit. Honestly, Keanu is so smart and generous to decline and explore other opportunities. WELL DONE KEANU THUMBS UP!",

However, the film grossed enough money to be numbered among the big summer hits of 1994, and the unfortunate result is this film, which reunites director Jan de Bont with leading lady Sandra Bullock, while leaving Keanu Reeves somewhere safe and dry, \"working on his music\" with his band, Dogstar. Considering the dubious quality of the final product, this may be the wisest decision of the young actor's career. Speed 2 can be numbered among the worst second chapters ever made.\r The original Speed was an entertaining jolt of pure adrenaline that took everyone by surprise. De Bont was an instant success and Bullock became a hot commodity. It was almost inevitable that any sequel, no matter how thrilling, would be a letdown. What no one anticipated was how sharply the downturn would be. Not only is Speed 2 missing the first movie's main character, but the excitement seems to have departed with him.\r This time around, Keanu Reeves' Jack Traven has been replaced by Jason Patric's Alex Shaw. For the most part, they're the same person (it shouldn't surprise anyone to learn that Alex was originally written as Jack), and their function is identical. The highest paid member of the cast, Sandra Bullock, is back as Annie. Now, having broken up with Jack, she's in the midst of a long- term relationship with Alex. Things are a little rocky between them, so Alex comes up with a solution: a romantic cruise to the Caribbean on the Seabourn Legend. However, just like John McLane in the Die Hard series, Annie is about to find herself in the wrong place at the wrong time. Also aboard the Seabourn Legend is a mentally-unstable computer genius named John Geiger (played without any panache by Willem Dafoe) who intends to take over the ship, crank the engines up to full power, and crash it into something very big.\r Speed 2 is a classic example of \"sound and fury, signifying nothing.\" Only, in this case, that \"nothing\" isn't bolstered by the high-energy tension and tremendous special effects of de Bont's previous excursion, Twister. Speed 2 is lackluster -- the plot methodically drives the film from one action set-piece to another, and the visuals are merely adequate. In fact, the only real thrill offered by Speed 2 comes during the bloated movie's final half-hour (as the ship's collision course becomes apparent). By then, it's too little, too late.\r The original Speed was frantically paced and featured a number of individuals that, in spite of their two-dimensionality, were likable and exhibited human characteristics. We felt like we were trapped on the bus with them. This time, the pace and characters are mechanical, and it doesn't seem as if we're actually on board the endangered cruise ship. Instead, we're watching form a detached vantage point, noticing details that we're not supposed to be paying attention to (like what kind of lighting best highlights Bullock's features) or waiting in vain for someone to break into a chorus of \"The Love Boat.\"\r Jason Patric has one mode: serious. The actor, who is best suited to introspective, brooding roles (as in The Journey of August King), treats this ridiculous screenplay like it's War and Peace. There's no sense of fun or goofiness. I never thought I would admit to missing Reeves, but that's the situation here -- at least he understood the right tone to adopt. Meanwhile, Bullock plays the same part the same way (albeit for a lot more money) -- she looks cute, gets involved in a couple of action scenes, and is taken hostage. But she and Patric never click; their chemistry is glacial.\r Since Dennis Hopper's Howard Payne was decapitated at the end of Speed, the sequel needs a new villain. Enter Willem Dafoe, who's usually a good psycho. Not here, though. Geiger has no manic energy, and Dafoe doesn't seem particularly excited to be playing him. Speed 2 is the kind of film that demands a strong opponent, but Geiger isn't it. Meanwhile, there are a few interesting cameos: Tim Conway and Bo Svenson have small parts, and Speed veterans Joe Morton and Glenn Plummer are on hand for a couple of scenes.\r Watching Speed 2, I felt embarrassed for everyone involved. Sure, they're all being well- paid, but no one wants a $120 million flop on their resume. And, once the word gets out about how disappointing this movie is, crowds will dwindle. There are enough action alternatives out there to sate the public's summer appetite. Someone should have recognized what an appropriate metaphor the climactic sequence (which features massive destruction) is for the entire film. Speed 2 appears headed for a box office disaster of titanic proportions. Creatively and entertainment-wise, it's already sunk.",
