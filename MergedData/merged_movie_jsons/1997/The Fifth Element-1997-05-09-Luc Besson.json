Chock full of killer performances and excellent effects.Korben Dallas is your average ordinary New York taxi driver. Fresh out of the military, unlucky in love and this close to losing his job. One day the ultimate fare literally falls into his lap as Leeloo enters his life via the roof of his cab. Leeloo it seems was genetically manipulated to be the ultimate weapon against pure evil but her beauty and butt-kicking hide a more fragile nature that Dallas and a host of others will have to step up and help her save humanity.This amazing sci-fi adventure from Luc (Leon) Besson has a little something for everyone. Beauty (the gorgeous Jovovich with orange hair even), action and gun-play, excellent acting, amazing visual effects, romance, creative sets and costume design, dynamic and interesting music and a mildly annoying but funny Chris Tucker. You name it\u0085this film has it in spades. 5th Element is hands down one of the best science fiction films ever.I've seen it many times and always want more. I highly recommended it.",

            "content": "From PASTO, COLOMBIA-Via: L. A. CA; CALI, COLOMBIA& ORLANDO, FLThe Fifth Element is in a category all its own. Just take a careful look at the IMDb info for the film. Country: France, Director: Luc Besson, Filming Locations: Pinewood Studios, UK (Mostly), an International Cast, and most certainly, a rather International feel to many aspects of the production. As an avid, lifelong film buff, it seems that as the years pass, the more I watch ELEMENT, the more I really come to appreciate practically every exquisite detail!Oddly, after my first viewing, I wasn't really all that impressed. I suppose it wasn't at all apparent to me just how much of an \"onion\" ELEMENT really was. From the onset, labeled 1914, exquisite design, costume and set elements are obvious! Analyze the external appearance of the alien \"protectors\"Quite artistic, indeed. The same can be said of their spacecraft. The music, by Eric Serra, has won awards and quite deservedly, I would say. It adds delicious depth and an International flavor and texture to most of its scenes.There is really something for everyone in ELEMENT. If you want straightforward action/comedy/entertainment, that really doesn't require much in the way of analysis, there is plenty. If you're a bit of a romantic, you, too, should be satisfied. And if you are looking for a \"Message\" or some sort of philosophical moral, if you look, I'm sure you will encounter quite a bit. IMDb lists it as Action/Adventure/Sci-FiTo which I would certainly add Comedy, among other elements.Not that ELEMENT is perfectIt does have a few minor flaws. Gary Oldman, for example, is frequently over-the-top, (but then again, when ISN'T he?) But, I must say, these moments add to the overall entertainment, all-in-good-fun, quality of the movie! Pretty much everything in ELEMENT honestly \"Works\" Which, in the total scheme of things, is what really matters, isn't it?8*......ENJOY/DISFRUTELA!Any comments, questions or observations, in English o en Espa\u00f1ol, are most welcome!",

            "content": "THE FIFTH ELEMENT is a complex film....if you WANT it to be! It offers varying levels of analysis depending on the tools you have to dig with! On the surface, a \"leave your brain in the cloakroom\" sci-fi yarn, you may well find wanting!  As far removed from STAR WARS as Austin Powers is from DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER. this film is pitched uniquely at those who can laugh at life but who have deep down an unquenchable desire for adventure and the romantic.Set on a futuristic earth, where really nothing has changed except the technology, Bruce Willis is STILL John McLane, a has-been stormtrooper reduced now to driving air-cabs for a living...same old premise for him - nothing's changed much since STRIKING DISTANCE, except maybe the yellow hair-rinse. Now, legend has it that in a time long long ago, the forces of darkness visited earth and were repelled by the unification in close proximity, of four stones representing the four elements. earth, wind, fire and water together with a fifth \"element\" of unknown origin.Dear old Ian Holm is Priest Cornelius, an expert authority on the five elements and keeper of all knowledge on things magical and mysterious. Gary Oldman in arguably his most way-put role is General Zorg who has done a deal with \"The Dark Side\" and whose sole purpose is to take possession of the elemental stones. The scene wherein he demonstrates the new weaponry to his alien henchman (from which the one-line \"summary quote\" above is taken) is an absolute classic of cinema. Milla Jovovich (Married to Besson at the time of the flick) is absolutely rivetting as Leeloo, the cloned/unzipped humanised fifth element. She must have practised long and hard perfecting her ancient language dialog....it's amazing. She strikes exactly the right note as a being of purity, femininity and warrior woman. As the film progresses she assumes the identitiy of the perfect girl any man would wish for and want to protect.The comedy angle is hysterical, the action sequences in your face, and the fx generally impressive if not mega weird at times. Color and visuals play a major role in this pro-European production, the continent where not surprisingly it was most successful. The outcome naturally is predictable and in the best traditions of \"will love save the day?\" as if it wasn't always going to???So, there u have it. Watch it one-dimensionally and that's what you'll get back. let it flow, immerse yourself in IT and you couldn't fail to have a good time, unless of course you are clinically dead or devoid of any sense of fun or fantasy ....but in that case you'd be wasting your time anyway, it wasn't MADE for you!",

            "content": "After making heavy movies like La Femme Nikita and Leon, it is somewhat of a departure for Luc Besson to do this comic, pulp, sci-fi film The Fifth Element. Looking at his work now, with such high-octane humor as the Transporter series, among others, (written by Besson, but not directed), it doesn't seem that out of place. He just must have decided to only direct his more serious fare and leave the fun stuff to others. However, The Fifth Element is by no means a slight film without a fan base. As far as sci-fi goes, this is a very capable installment. With its mythology, creatures, action, and special effects, the movie has everything going for it. The humor that's infused just makes it better, vaulting it through genres and making it accessible to almost everyone who gives it a try.Like most of its ilk, the story revolves around an evil force about to devour Earth and the rest of life itself as it increases in size and power with each influx of destruction and hate thrown at it. Every opportunity to blow it up only makes it stronger. Through a series of fortunate/ unfortunate happenings, (depending on who you are aligning with), we have the paths crossing of a priest who holds the answers for survival, an ex-military, cab driver bent on having some fun and excitement, a strange woman from another place at the center of it all, an evil mercenary out for money, and the government of the galaxy trying to save face in front of inevitable extermination. It is good versus evil traveling through space in order to either shed light or death out to the universe as victory.In what is a nice little introduction to the myth of the fifth element that will unite with the more common four to wipe out evil, we learn of those who keep the secret of its location. We don't quite know if these aliens are good or not until later, but we do find out the impetus for their coming to the temple on display. A cut forward in time introduces us to the president of the galaxies, (played in what would seem to be horrible casting, but ends up being pretty good with Tommy \"Tiny\" Lister, Jr.), and our head priest in the guarding of the truth, Ian Holm. Holm explains what the dark force coming after them is and goes on the quest to find the fifth element and her four stones needed to combat it. This supreme being, played wonderfully by Milla Jovovich with a childlike glee and discovery, falls into the unwitting hands of cabbie Korben Dallas\u0097Bruce Willis at his sarcastic bad-ass best. Willis must join with Holm and Jovovich on a mission to recover the stones and find a way to save the world.A lot of the success lies with the man behind it all, Luc Besson. His script is made up of a pretty solid plot line as far as the world destruction goes. Everything makes sense and is explained in a way to not bore us, but instead in tidbits culled from the numerous characters running about it this singularly unique landscape. The art direction is spectacular and for being a decade old, still has some nice special effects that stand up. I've always been a proponent for prosthetics, when able, at the expense of computer graphics. Reactions are always better from actors who have something real to play off of and the lighting and environments just become more realistic. Even so, when computers are used, the effects are more subtle than flashy and never take away from the story that is being told. No matter what spectacle is on display, the script is what is important.All the personalities on display also lead to much of the greatness that The Fifth Element has to offer. Bruce Willis is the king of this kind of role. His quips and rapport with those around him are priceless. Other standouts are Chris Tucker, in an early role for him, and the great Gary Oldman. Tucker takes loud and obnoxious to a whole new level, but it works flawlessly. His radio DJ has no shame when it comes to working a crowd or chasing the ladies, but his utter fear of danger is hilarious. As for Oldman, I have to believe Besson just said create something fresh. This villain is a pastiche of so many crazy components. His futuristic hair, complete with plastic half shield, is plain weird; the southern accent and buck teeth look is just the right amount of hillbilly; and the disposition of greed and ambivalence is perfect for a bad guy. When he explains how destruction allows all the little machines that man created to finally have work cleaning up the mess, it's fantastic. The real beauty, though, is that no matter how many strong lead roles are here, the little guys steal scenes as well. Singer Tricky is great as Oldman's \"Right Arm\" and Mathieu Kassovitz partakes in one of the best scenes in the film when he attempts to mug Willis at his apartment.Even with all its camp and fun, Besson keeps it all grounded in drama as any fantasy tale does. He has a real vision for aesthetics and has changed his scope often as he goes from film to film. From the mobster/corrupt cop world of New York, to the countryside of war with Joan of Arc, he never pigeonholes himself in a style. I am still holding out hope that his newest, Angel-A, with all its black and white, stylish noir feel, will hit the big screens here in Buffalo. It will be a real shame if the rumors are true and the completion of his children tale, Arthur and the Minimoys, will be the final work by him as a director.",

            "content": "I remember when 'The Fifth Element' first came out in the cinema in 1997. I saw it twice. It was awesome. It was only really after its release did the narrative begin breaking through (the ways thing did prior to the internet!) that it wasn't 'very good.' And yet everyone I spoke to loved it. I worked in a video rental store in 1998. It was still a major title and the public seemed to love it, too.Over time I realised that, despite critics seemingly delighting in pulling it apart, the general public thought it was great. They say there are only about ten different story types and that every film is just a variation on the way each is told. With that in mind, 'The Fifth Element' isn't anything particularly original in terms of the actual story - in the distant future, a giant planet of 'pure evil' is hurtling towards the Earth preparing to wipe all us humans out. The only thing that can destroy it is a being of pure goodness (Milla Jovovich before she hit the big time in the 'Resident Evil' franchise), who just so happens to be in the care of a wise-cracking New York taxi driver (Bruce Willis when he still put effort into his performances). However, what makes the film stand out is the way its presented.If ever a film 'built a world' it was here. The special effects may look just ever-so-slightly dated today, they were amazing for the time and I think most people will still enjoy them for what they are. You'll see New York in the future with mile high skyscrapers and flying queues of cars gridlocked around their peaks (beating the 'Star Wars' prequels by a few years!). You'll see a variety of futuristic settings and technology, presented as if they are just everyday items that everyone uses. I hear fashion designer Jean Paul Gauteur (spelling!) personally designed every costume - right from the stars' own wardrobe to the background characters to give every person that 'space-age feel.'I've already said that Bruce Willis was still an A-list star when he made this. His once natural charm and endearing smirk, mixed with wise-cracks and macho heroics worked well here with Milla Jovovich's faux naive persona which underlies her true mystical powers. But they're just the icing on the cake. 'The Fifth Element' is practically an ensemble cast with villainous Gary Oldman as the bad-guy and Ian Holm as the well-meaning priest who's on hand to help out. Maybe the reason there was a certain amount of hate directed towards the film was down to Chris Rock. If you ever see some online list of 'Most Annoying Characters in Films' you'll probably find him as 'Number 2' (only pipped by Jar Jar Binks from 'Star Wars'). Yes, he's pretty obnoxious - but he's supposed to be! You're supposed to be irritated by his antics and he only comes into the story in the last third, so - personally - if you really can't stand him that much, I'm sure he should ruin the whole film for you.Basically, 'The Fifth Element' has everything an enduring film should have. It has action, romance, sci-fi (if you're into that!), adventure, sets, special effects, costumes, humour, brilliant direction (the way characters in one scene answer a seemingly unrelated question a different character had just posed is very nice and adds to the quirky feel very well) and - perhaps most importantly - if has all that without needing to be 'adult' in content. It was rated 'PG' here in the UK and I think it's a film that all the family can enjoy together. Better still... it never received a sequel or remake (to date, 2020!), therefore leaving this as a perfectly self-contained little gem of sci-fi brilliance.",

            "content": "There is so much entertainment in this movie it would be almost stupid to write about its flaws. Especially the story is not the best thing here, but who cares. I liked every scene, every moment in this movie. The movie opens in Egypt, 1914, and we meet some strange creatures. From here on we know this is not going to be a normal or very serious sci-fi action movie. The creatures tell a priest that the stones are no longer save on earth and they take some things. They tell the priest they will return in 300 years, when evil arrives.300 years later. The strange creatures return but they are attacked by other strange creatures. The only thing that survives is reconstructed and turns out to be Lee Loo (Milla Jovovich). She is the fifth element, the ultimate weapon against evil. Evil here looks like a great ball of fire. Lee Loo escapes from the authorities, and in an astonishing shot we see how a city looks like now. She jumps of a building and ends up in the flying cab of Korben Dallas (Bruce Willis). He saves her from the police, she asks for priest Vito Cornelius (Ian Holm), he brings her there.We learn a little more about Lee Loo here. She needs four stones, the four other elements, to save the world. The stones are on a vacation resort where we meet DJ Ruby Rhod (Chris Tucker). He has some funny scenes as well. We have also met Zorg, who is played by Gary Oldman in a great way. The attack on the strange creatures early in the movie was planned by him. He wants the stones as well, he is offered a lot of money for them. How the story develops from here I will not reveal.The story doesn't even matter. In every scene we have something to like. Beautiful settings, great visual effects, Gary Oldman, the beautiful Jovovich or the funny moments from Bruce Willis, Chris Tucker and Ian Holm. May be this movie is not for everyone but if you don't think to much you will definitely like it.",

It's kinda like a live action comic book.  Visually stunning, awesome use of color that just jumps out at you, and non-stop action, lots of it done with tongue firmly in cheek. Plot?  Well forget the plot, it's the weak point of the film.  But hey who ever said comic books had to have strong plots? Willis, Jovovich, and the rest do a fine job.  I especially like the casting of Jovovich, she exudes innocence, vulnerability, sex, exotica, intelligence, and kung fu machismo all at the same time. So turn off the cynicism sign as you watch and just enjoy the ride.  Great stuff!",

I adored the concept and the story even with the lack of flow never failed to intrigue.The script and satire are fun and slick, the visuals are breathtaking and unusual especially the amazing Big Apple effects with honourable mention to the camp trip to the resort planet Fhoston Paradise and there are plenty of thrills and imagination in the atmosphere to be had.Besson's direction is excellent, Eric Serra's music is atmospheric and jaunty and the characters are fun. As is the acting, Bruce Willis is charismatic, Milla Jovovich is beautiful and Gary Oldman is the personification of haute-couture corruption.

The only thing I was disappointed in was the enemy aliens. They looked a little too artificial.My favorite thing about the whole movie was the music. It went from techno to opera to jazz, and to all over. I loved the music, partially because they used Engima and Vangelis.

But when I stopped taking the movie so serious, I really started to enjoy it. I thought it was a very fun movie.THE FIFTH ELEMENT is about an evil force coming to destroy the world. Five elements are needed to destroy the evil force and save the Earth. Four of them are stones and one of them is a beautiful woman named Leeloo (Milla Jovovich), who is absolutely \"perfect\". A priest named Cornelius (Ian Holm) seeks the elements to try to save the world while the military sends a the retired Major Korben Dallas (Bruce Willis) to find the elements and stop a bunch of alien bounty hunter-like bad guys and a very evil man (and of course very rich) man who is under the employment of the evil force named Zorg (Gary Oldman).And of course, there is the insane but loved radio DJ Ruby Rhod (Chris Tucker) who gets trapped in the middle of this whole thing and becomes the comic relief of the movie, even though this movie really does not need comic relief. At first you will probably find him annoying, but he will grow on you. At least, this happened to me.The acting is fair, but nothing special. Chris Tucker does a good job as the nutcase radioman, and Ian Holm does a pretty good job as the priest set out to save the planet. This was a very different type of role for Gary Oldman. He was still a bad guy, of course, but it was a much more comical part. It surely wasn't his best work, but it was still OK. Bruce Willis did a great job playing his part, and Milla Jovovich was excellent as the sexy but strong fifth element.The special effects were fantastic. The story to this movie is nothing big, but like I said the main purpose of this movie is for the viewer to have fun.

Three hundred years later and pure evil has stirred in the far reaches of space \u0096 and is heading straight for Earth, with traditional weapons unable to stop it. When the Fifth Element is returned, the ship is attacked and seemingly lost \u0096 but scientists are able to recreate the fifth element and are surprised to find it is a beautiful young woman, Leeloo. When Leeloo escapes custody she is helped by ex-army taxi driver Korben Dallas. Korben takes her to the priest she names, but he finds that everyone wants her for one reason or another \u0096 then he finds that both the army and the priest need him to go on a mission to reclaim the missing four stones and save the Earth from evil.I have seen this film several times and will usually come back to it if I find myself in the mood \u0096 but yet I also find myself thinking of its flaws whenever anyone asks me about it. I can't understand why I do this because I really do enjoy this film even though there is much I sort of dislike about it. The plot is one of the weak points; generally it is quite good as an idea but it has many weak points that make it seem rather silly and overly busy. While this is not enough to really damage the film I know that it has put some people off in some audiences, but for me it was only a minor problem as these rather silly bits were all part of a film that had a great sense of fun running through it. Some of it didn't make much sense and at times I got the feeling that the film had more ideas than it really knew what to do with, but the majority of it worked well. The action is good but you should be prepared for the fact that, like much of the film, it is done with a certain amount of tongue in cheek humour. Suffice to say I never found it dull and it has plenty going on for the majority of the filmVisually is the area where the film is strongest and I could watch it for this alone. The effects are great and are full of imagination as well as looking very impressive. The design work of Dan Weil is very well used and compliments the effects used \u0096 the film looks lavish and rich all the way through and matches the wonderful costumes from Jean-Paul Gaultier. Of course much of the praise goes to Luc Besson who has managed to pull this together really well to produce an endlessly impressive film, which manages to be a fun and exciting sci-fi.The casting also backs this idea up and features many performances that are spot on with tongue in cheek performances that match the tone of the film perfectly. Bruce Willis delivers the same, great mocking performance that he tried in Hudson Hawk but here he does it in a film that is better structured and less silly than that one and it works a lot better. He still delivers the goods as an action lead but he puts his tongue just far enough in his cheek so as to be there without hurting the film! I don't want to overdo it (after all \u0096 he is Bruce Willis!) but I thought he was very well cast here. Oldman is very hammy but this also works as it matches the humour of the piece. Jovovich had a very difficult role and it is easy to laugh at her baby talk etc but I think she made it work well and gave a good performance against the odds. Holm is pretty good and brings humour to his role as well. Tucker, sadly, fails to do the same as these and his overblown performance doesn't even fit well within this film (god knows where it WOULD fit!) and he only succeeds in being shrill and very annoying throughout \u0096 not all his fault, his character is a wholly unnecessary part of the film. The support cast is roundly good and features a raft of famous faces in minor roles including Lee Evans, Brion James, Tricky, Luke Perry and Kim Chan. Generally the cast seem to be right on the same page as their director and compliment the material and tone perfectly.Overall this is far from a perfect film and some may find the humour to be at odds with the sci-fi action; but for my money the fact that most of the film backed up this tongue in cheek tone made it all work. Some of the plot has too many ideas or unnecessary elements but most of it is really good and, combined with mostly good performances and stunning designs and effects make for a film that I will watch many times even if I cannot help but see the weaknesses that many others cannot get past.",

Luc Besson, a creative genius and the director of classic films such as The Big Blue, Nikita and Leon (The Professional) has returned to the genre that started his filmmaking career, sci-fi. In The Fifth Element Luc Besson realises his life long ambition to make a film based on a story he thought of while still at school, Zaltman Bleros. Writing and directing the film, he skillfully mixes humour with action and amazing visual effects that put The Fifth Element in a class of it's own. Stunning performances are put forward by Milla Jovovich, Bruce Willis, Ian Holm, Chris Tucker and Gary Oldman, who returns to work with Luc Besson after playing Norman Stansfield in Leon. The Fifth Element show us how well comedy, action and romance can be put together. Overlooked at the Academy Awards, Luc Besson won the Cesar for Best Director at Cannes in 1998 for The Fifth Element. Simply, an excellent film, 10/10.",

However, a team of scientists use the DNA of the remains of The Fifth Element to rebuild the perfect being called Leeloo (Milla Jovovich).

But the skilled Korben Dallas has fallen in love with Leeloo and decides to help her to retrieve the stones.I have just seen \"The Fifth Element\" maybe for the fourth or fifth time (last time was on 16 February 2002) and I enjoyed this film the same way I did fifteen years ago. The special effects are excellent; the story if funny and entertaining; Chris Tucker steals the movie with his gay character; Bruce Willis is excellent in action films; and Milla Jovovich is impressively gorgeous.

Set in a not so far future, the eternal battle between good and evil is shown to us in an extravagant setting. Flying cars, aeroplanes that go at the speed of light, weird creatures and ugly aliens are only a few things that are present during this film. The story has never been seen before : Good has only one weapon to defeat evil; it is composed of four stones representing the four element (water, earth, fire and air) and a perfect creature. These five elements have to be united before the forces of evil arrive to earth. But evil has found help and the stones have disappeared. Bruce Willis (one of the best action actors of our time), Milla Jovovich, Ian Holm and Gary Oldman make the suspense even more intense. Chris Tucker is incredibly funny and ads a lot to the comic side of the film. The story is extremely imaginative and is, in my opinion, one of Luc Besson's best. I have never seen anything else like it. The costumes, designed by Jean-Paul Gaultier, are unbelievably imaginative and fun. They are a big part of the extravagance and originality of the movie. The score, by Eric Serra (one of my favourites) is simply a work of art. And last but not least, the special effects are absolutely excellent, adding to the quality of the movie. If you are looking for action and a good laugh, this is the film to see. But the actors are not the only things that make this film worth seeing. Click here",

Not even Planet of the Apes (2001) could compete with this film's cinematography.

            "content": "Last night I watched \"The Fifth Element\" (1997) written /directed by Luc Besson for the first time - somehow I missed it and not being a huge fan of sci-fi, I did not search for it. Better later then never - the movie is pure and marvelous fun. It smiles at itself, does not take itself seriously and it is outrageously beautiful. It is a perfect mixture of Action / Adventure / Romance / Sci-Fi / Thriller/ with the comedy and the funny one, too. It seems to me that Steven Spielberg might have used some ideas of \"The Fifth Element\" in his great \"Minority Report\". The story's five elements, four stones that represent water, earth, fire and air, and a perfect human creature - a girl, must together fight the absolute evil. Bruce Willis is as good as ever doing what he does best -fighting the bad guys (ugly scary aliens and very bad Gary Oldman with a hairdo you have to see to believe) and saving not just a hotel or one big city or even the great country but the Life as we know it. Luc Besson, the director, also wrote the story and the screenplay and I read that he had written it when he was 13. I think it is great that he adapted his own early writings because there is so much joy in it, the joy and happiness that only can be felt in one's childhood. The visuals, the sound, and the music to the film are terrific. The costumes created by another boy-genius, \"enfant terrible\" of Paris haute couture Jean-Paul Gaultier will grab your eye and attention - so shockingly creative and unforgettable they are - the garment Milla was wearing in her first scene, for example. Who would think the wide band-aids can look so sexy yet innocent yet crazy when wrapped around a beautiful girl? Bruce Willis's orange top that matches Milla's blinding red hair, absolutely hilarious outfits DJ Ruby Rhod (Chris Tucker) was proudly wearing? I am smiling now when I just think of them. Milla Yovovich possesses a rare exotic unusual beauty and the eyes, radiant and green like a new spring grass - she was a perfect choice for a perfect creature, the Mankind's only hope for survival in the eternal ferocious struggle between Good and Evil, Creativity and Destruction, Life and Death, Love and Hatred.",

Deep in outer space a large moon like fiery planet has appeared from nowhere, not knowing what it is several Earth spaceships fire rockets into it but it only gets bigger & destroys the ships. Father Vito Cornelius (Ian Holm) tries to tell the president (Tommy 'Tiny' Lister) of an ancient legend where a force of pure evil will destroy all life in the universe & that he believes it has finally come & that a bunch of friendly aliens known as the Mondoshawan hold the key to defeating it with the four elements -wind, Earth, fire, water- & a mysterious fifth element. As they try to land on Earth the Mondoshawan spaceship is shot down by a race of aliens called Mangalore's hired by evil billionaire Jean-Baptiste Emanuel Zorg (Gary Oldman), however a hand is found in the wreckage & using it's DNA scientists create a body for it & it turns out to be a beautiful woman (Milla Jovovich) who escapes & ends up in the back of Korben's taxi who then becomes involved in finding the four elements & the mysterious fifth...This French production was written & directed by Luc Besson & I thought The Fifth Element was a wonderfully over-the-top sci-fi action flick that probably won't be to all tastes but it was certainly to mine. Besson apparently wrote the script while he was in high school which means absolutely nothing & is a lot of fun, it's action packed, it moves along like a rocket, there are some nice ideas here & it shows some imagination rather than just being a rehash. I liked all the character's in this, from Willis' special ops taxi driver to Jovovich's fragile yet interesting alien Leeloo to Chris Tucker's over-the-top gay DJ who you'll either love or hate to Holm's dotty priest to Gary Oldman's sinister villain. Having said that neither the hero Bruce Willis or the villain Gary Oldman ever meet on screen which sounds odd but is true. There are some colourful character's in here & some suitably odd looking aliens. The Fifth Element has a fantastic blend of substance & style, the story is good & eminently watchable while the film simply oozes with style & class. I thought some of the sci-fi elements were cool with a great comic book like interpretation of the future with flying cars & ultra compact apartments where things fold away into the walls to save space, the comedy & light heartiness worked well too with some nice one-liners & a fair amount of quotable dialogue & it's action scenes were similarly impressive with various gunfights, explosions, bombs & martial arts scenes, I mean it's all here what more do you want?Director Besson shines here as The Fifth Element is a stylish masterpiece, I've always though film was a visual medium & I love it when filmmakers just let loose & try to make something visually stunning & in The Fifth Element I think they've succeeded with panache. From the bright colour schemes to the constant use of shapes & angles to the imaginative & still pretty impressive special effects which were probably a mixture of traditional model work & CGI computer effects to the cinematography The Fifth Element has to be one of the best looking sci-fi films ever & it's a film I could watch purely on an aesthetic level regardless of the story. I love the look of the film, the design of the spaceships & the outlandish costumes designed by Jean-Paul Gaultier in which Bruce Willis goes from his trademark white vest from Die Hard (1988) to a bright orange one here which I thought was a nice little touch & maybe a nod to his earlier success. The aliens look good too & as a whole this is a joy to watch.With a supposed budget of about $90,000,000 The Fifth Element at the time it was made was the biggest budget none Hollywood film & one has to say the money show's on screen with plenty of special effects & a convincingly realised futuristic world, it was largely shot in England & has high production values. The cinematography is great but please, please, please make sure you watch it in widescreen. The acting is pretty good, I've always liked Bruce Willis & I like him in this, Chris Tucker is sort of annoying but not enough to totally spoil it.The Fifth Element is a fantastic sci-fi action film that's as good to look at as anything out there, the style together with an entertaining story & Bruce Willis pretty much means The Fifth Element is a personal favourite of mine, what can I say? Watch it as soon as you can.",

            "content": "The Fifth Element, years ago it now seems (and was), played a lot of TV and I usually watched it many times when it was on. It's not really a 'great' film, or one that should be seen by all serious genre fans like Leon- The Professional was for crime films. But it's probably one of the most watchable science fiction adventures put to the screen in the late 90s, a kind of techno-punk version of Star Wars meant more for the late teens crowd than for everyone. It's story is simple enough- trying to retrieve some missing stones that will help save the world from a meteor or other about to collide and destroy everything, and the group of people who can stop it- that its the colorful, strange supporting performances and imaginative visuals can steal the show. Milla Jovovich, more than anyone, makes her mark as a real kind of 'breakthrough' role (i.e. I never really heard of her before the movie and for a while I thought of her as the '5th element' chick in high school). Her role doesn't require too much dialog- as she barely speaks English throughout most of the film. She's got the sexy look (PG-13 with nudity for the boys), lots of power in the fight scenes, and she can even work the emotional scenes to. I would probably take her work in this film over her other Besson collaboration in Joan of Arc, as here she takes herself seriously for what she is, and it still ranks as one of her very best performances so far in her decade long career playing roles like this.The rest of the cast, however, is a bit more hit or miss, though a little more hit than miss. Bruce Willis is his usually cynical, hard-edged self with remnants of John McClaine kicking around as an ex-officer turned cab driver who's recruited to take the '5th element' (Jovovoich) to get the stones and to the temple. Gary Oldman is very bizarre (see the 'blood' or 'sweat' or whatever trickle down his forehead during a tense phone conversation) as a villain who is a kind of pawn for the enemy, while also supplying weapon for a bunch of ugly creatures. Some of his scenes are the funniest, while being very creepy the whole while. Others like Tony Lister and Ian Holm are dependable as always in uncomplicated 2-dimensional roles. Only Chris Tucker gets pestering in his most flamboyant role to date (if that's possible) as the 'comic relief' in the form of a celeb host. I don't know if whether the character is really the problem or Tucker's interpretation, but I still feel those scenes are kind of distracting and below Tucker's comic skills.But as a pure action spectacle, you could do worse than the 5th Element, where it's a kind of future world with weird gadgets and items, all in a more Earth-bound perspective. The main battle scene in the opera is also on par with some of the better sequences in The Professional. Sometimes the themes are hit a little too often, repetitive if you will, like with Jovovich getting over-emotional (though her little lesson on the history of the world via computer is amazing). So it's not really as fantastic as Besson might think it is, yet every time it was on I didn't change the channel much; it's got that comic-book appeal where you know what will happen- of course in repeat viewings- but you want to stay tuned for the really nifty sequences and rewarding unconventional moments and lines.",

It turns out that this woman, Leeloo (Jovovich) is actually the Fifth Element, a supreme being who, when joined with four ancient sacred stones representing wind, fire, water and earth, can fight evil. Which is lucky, since Evil is coming their way in the form of a big pulsating planet, assisted by the impossibly rich tycoon Zorg (Oldman), who is trying to locate the four stones so that Evil can prevail. After teaming up with a priest named Father Vito Cornelius (Holm) to find the stones, they travel to another planet on behalf of the Federation of the United States, where they meet up with various alien life forms who want to help or harm them, and their most frightening encounter of all, radio DJ Ruby Rhod. (Tucker)Truthfully, I am conflicted when it comes to my ultimate outlook on this film. Visually, it was completely captivating. The set designs, (layers of air traffic in the streets of New York, going up hundreds of stories, a floating Central Park) the costumes (Gaultier, with his usual S&M-looking couture) and the colorful hair and makeup were fantastic. A lot of the contraptions (a mask that instantly does your makeup, a cigarette machine that dispenses cigarettes with increasingly longer filters for those who are trying to quit smoking) were clever and entertaining, and the overall style of the film was impressive. There were certainly some things that were really odd to me that don't really warrant explanation, I still scratched my head about, (like what was the deal with Gary Oldman sounding exactly like Billy Bob Thornton>) but ultimately chalked up to eccentricity.There wasn't even anything universally wrong with the script; I thought that it was a very basic, but fun story, and I liked the fact that notorious badass Willis wasn't so much living up to his reputation until we approached the end of the film. Unfortunately, I became more and more irritated with some of the \"humor\" (mostly slapstick type things; people saying, \"W-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-what do you mean, a BOMB?!\" and the like\u0085 I think I heard \"W-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w\" at least thirty times throughout the film) that was being presented. After viewing the film, I discovered that Besson had actually written this screenplay when he was in high school, something that is slightly impressive, but actually explains a lot in terms of the goofiness, I think. The other major irritant was Chris Tucker. I completely understand that his character was supposed to be way out there (kind of a cross between Prince and Grace Jones) but I think that the weird costumes, hair and mannerisms could have sufficed. Instead I had flashbacks to sitting in the theater watching \"Star Wars: Episode I\" and literally wanting to get up and hit something after listening to Jar-Jar Binks screech and prattle on. Tucker's high-pitched voice and utter lack of charm did not win any points with me, and if anything, he made the film lose at least one point on my ratings scale. Other than the aforementioned things, there wasn't a whole lot to dislike about \"The Fifth Element\" but there wasn't really anything to get excited about either. If this film didn't have the obnoxious Chris Tucker in it, I would consider it to be a great popcorn flick. Instead, even while just mentally flashing back to some of his scenes, I begin to feel like a drill is nearing my ear. However, because the film was fairly enjoyable other than his scenes, I give it a 5/10.--Shelly",

It features a futuristic civilization rivaling / surpassing that found in most films of its type. It also boasts a cornucopia of interesting and bizarre characters, creatures, and futuristic fashions.Bruce Willis, in one of his best roles ever, is cab driver Korben Dallas, who is enlisted by fate to assist Leeloo on her mission. They're up against the odious tycoon J. B. E. Zorg (Gary Oldman), who has made a deal with the Evil to usher in global destruction in exchange for incredible wealth.With this movie, Director Luc Besson takes a very basic \"good vs. Evil\" story and blasts it into the stratosphere, resulting in a classic tale of mind-boggling entertainment. Everyone is great, including Chris Tucker as the hilariously annoying personage known as Ruby Rhod!As for Ms. Jovovich herself, she embodies the titular character so well it's scary! Her innocence is matched only by her ability to defend herself when necessary.BEST BITS AND BOBS: #1- The flying car traffic! #2- the multi-layered / multi-leveled city! #3- The cruise ship! #4- The Mangalores! #5- The astonishing weapons! #6- Leeloo's resurrection! #7- The Diva!This is a stellar achievement on this or any other planet...",

            "content": "As a kid I watched this, I wouldn't even know how many times, long time since a saw this and recently gave it a watch. And I have to say, it holds up, almost even better then I remembered and as the movie this time unfolded before me, I realized I remember every scene, but also that so much time had passed, that it still felt new while at the same time I remembered all of it, kind of a strange feeling actually but a good one.It's not flawless movie, it's very silly at times and the plot makes little sense and kind of follows one of the most basic story lines there ever been in storytelling. But it works, beacuse the film is filled to the brime with so much more then the basic core element of the basic plot.A stylistic cyberpunk masterpiece. With great performances all around. And also really funny, not a comedy per say, but the jokes do come at a steady flow and the humor works, this movie is actually filled with jokes and has a humorous tone as a whole over all, but in a way that really works for its benefit, because it becomes a part of the artistic style and vibe of this a bit wacky fantasy universe, that still very much represents our society and the human race, even if all in all a bit cartoonish and crazy here. This was also the movie were Chris Tucker were introduced to later become the Rush Hour star and Mila Jovovich was introduced, that later carried the whole Resident Evil movie franchise on her own, poor girl (just kidding). And this is to me Bruce Willis greatest film that he stars in (and he have made many good films) and Gary Oldman portrays a great cartoonish villian here that won't soon be forgotten.Now, what truly makes this movie so great is the sci-fi setting combined with Luc Besons artistic flare, here it creates magic (sadley I think Beson tried to do this aging in Valarian and The City of Thousand Planets but it really didn't work that time, mostly because the actors sucked but also because some misstakes from Beson).I think The Fifth Element is a cultural classic and actually had a cultural impact. It had a lot of imaginative ideas that has been used in other successful franchises today. Even though it perhaps wasn't the first on all of these ideas, for example we already had a strong femma fatale cyberpunk women in the Ghost In The Shell anime from 1995, but we still had never seen this before in a live action movie. Then we have the thing that she can use a computer to learn things that takes years to learn in merely seconds, later used by the Wachowisky brothers in Matrix. Then off course the big metropolitan with the insane traffic of flying cars (later used in the Star Wars prequels), is perhaps the biggest character of the movie. The city really benifited from being made with combination of miniatures and cgi, because that gives it an artistic and authentic look, that still holds up today.There are some iconic shots in this movie, for example the scene when Leeloo jumps from the building wall with an over head view as she jumps out into the traffic of flying cars, is just fantastic, what a great shot. And the whole scene with the blue tentacle-head opera singer is a masterpiece, who ever knows about this movie knows about that, seeing that was the first time in my life I thought \"hey, maybe opera is not that horrible as I have previously believed.\" And there are so many more moments in this movie, that at least to me is iconic, like Chris Tuckes character introduction as he does his monolog to his radio show, the Asian flying street restaurant and many more scenes and moments.This movie also tries to get serious at one point and carry a deeper more sentimental message and it does not come of cheesy to me, it's beautiful. This entire movie works perfectly. The action scenes are a bit silly, or very extremely silly, but this is how action was made in the 90s and it's a comforting nostalgic expirence to me.Sure, the story is very basic in the most simplest of forms. We have a big evil thing that wants to destroy all life. We have a somewhat antihero of a guy that's a bit lost in life but still unmistakably a good guy. We have the damsel in distress. And we have the mcmuffin thingys that the heros of the story needs get to certain place to destroy the evil. Has this story been told before? Yes, countless of times. But in The Fifth Element it's all the other things around it that makes the movie. And as a crasy-cyberpunk-futer movie goes, this is one of the absolut best. It's a masterpiece. And a classic. I personally just love it.",

It's fun, funny, kinetic, amazing looking and has one of Gary Oldman's most enjoyable performances (even if Oldman himself hates the film).A lot of the fun comes from the bizarre cast of characters. The Laconic Korben Dallas, the beautiful and mysterious Leeloo, the ADHD poster child Ruby Rhod (seriously, who thought of Chris Tucker for this? That was brilliant and unexpected), the dour priest, the evil industrialist and his alien buddies, a blue opera singer... Who comes up with this stuff?My favorite part is Gary Oldman's character Jean Baptiste Emanuel Zorg. Supposedly, Oldman took this role out of loyalty to his friend, Besson, and didn't like the film at all. I was sad to read this, because to me, Zorg is one of the most entertaining characters ever put on screen. His monologue about the virtues of destruction is a classic, and his description of the gun he's selling to the aliens should be shown back to back with any \"Q\" scene from a 007 film. (In the same way that This Is Spina Tap should be shown back to back with The Kids Are All Right.)All of this is wrapped up in a truly unique visual style and slick special effects that never seem forced.Sometimes what you really want from a movie is pure escapist entertainment, and that's what you get from The Fifth Element.The cherry on top: Korben's mother, voiced by Jill Mullan who literally phoned her part in.",

Jovovich looks a little like Uma Thurman, facially. She's interesting to watch with hr looks, strange dress and strange language. Gary Oldman plays his normal wacked-out character. In this one, he has to sports the world's worst hairdo ever seen on film! Tucker, who plays a RuPaul-type DJ called \"Ruby Rhod,\" and he grates on your nerves, big-time.

Science fiction films do not, in large part I think because it provides a simple scaffold for special effects and other moneymaking cinematic crutches. The only intelligent film constructions I can quickly recall are: Forbidden Planet; 2001; Bladerunner, and yes, this. Surprised?What I like are not the effects so much. Nor the story about Milla being a reconstructed key -- that's all rather illogical and unimaginative. Some of the small touches charm, but they pale compared to the big trick: the Chris Tucker character. He becomes the frantic narrator; self-absorbed but contrarily not as he is lost in the role of being the eyes for a whole population. The filmmaker puts himself in the film and by reference our own appetites for titillatingly exaggerated explosions and suspense.\nSo if you love science fiction for its metaphoric notions, for its clever creations of new or alternative worlds, then you will also be annoyed when the public draws it into the trivial sewer of cowboy revenge, of Bruckheimer propane bombs, or predictable, Hardy Boy last-minute escapes from doom, of bulbous boobs, of cheap scares. And you will appreciate this wonderful intrusion of the Tucker character. Willis has an appreciated comic talent, which in my memory will be epitomized by his one-syllable responses to that randy public.",

Bruce Willis is perfect for the laid-back air-Taxi driver and Milla Jovovich gave a perfect performance as the alien. CAUTION - MAY HAVE SOME SPOILERS BELOW.The movie starts in the year 1914, in Egypt, and we learn about the existence of a \"Fifth element\" to go along with the other four - wind, fire, earth, and water. The grotesque but friendly aliens take the elements and vow to return with them in 300 years when there will be danger.Cut to NYC in 2214. Vehicular traffic now travels in all 3 dimensions. Apartments resemble large railway sleeper compartments with a stove and fridge. The aliens with the 5th element are returning to Earth when they are shot down by bad guys. Only a \"hand\" survives. The DNA shows that it is a complex but \"perfect\" creature. So they put it into their \"people reconstructor\" and \"voila\", a perfect and nude Milla appears as the \"supreme being.\"  She can't talk or read yet, but learns at lightning speed and eventually tells them where the 5 elements are.Intergalactic, light-speed travel and a performance by the \"diva\" finally leads to the elements. Of course the ugly, bad-guy aliens are after them too so there is lots of shooting and a number of exlosions. but the good guys prevail.The climax of the movie is back in Egypt, with a giant fireball heading directly to destroy the Earth. Milla is almost dead and they need her to save humanity. The way the film portrayed the \"activation\" of the 5 elements was really fine and touching special effects. And, all along, the 5th element represented \"love\", and when it was expressed the world was saved.Explained this way it sounds trite. But the movie was filled with so many fine special effects with really great 5.1 Digital Dolby soundtrack on DVD that as a whole it is very entertaining. \"Over-the-top\" for sure, but that was its intent. We are not to take it seriously as we might have some of the other \"destruction\" movies. This one is more in the vein of \"Men in Black\", but even a bit more over-the-top.  One of the best tracks available to demo surround sound with powered subwoofer. A really, really powerful and gripping soundtrack.  But, watched on an ordinary sound system, or TV speakers, you lose at least half of the film's impact. Definitely made for \"home theater.\"",

The clothing and hairstyles are silly and distract from the film's strengths. The aspect of the mother could also be removed. But really, there is a very clever script under all this.

It's an opening scene that has featured in many movies and TV shows and while it's not very original it is a beautiful location , but not as beautiful as what happens next when the aliens land and make their first appearance in a very memorable scene that had me thinking I'd be watching a great movie Oh dear . The problem with having a superb opening is that it's difficult to keep up the consistency and I think this is where the rest of the movie fails . Before too long we jump 300 years into the future where the Earth is in danger from pig faced aliens . I am not xenophobic and have no prejudice about mankind being threatened by pig faced aliens any more that mankind being threatened by mutants in a metallic shell screeching \" EX-TER-MIN-NATE \" or aliens disguised as showroom dummies . No my problem is that director Luc Besson seems to frequently forget all about pig faced aliens and impresses us with set design and special effects thereby sacrificing narrative drive . We see a machine that reminds characters to stop smoking , we see a pod that turns itself into a machine gun/cross bow / flame thrower / rocket launcher , in fact there's hardly a scene in the whole movie in which the plot isn't held up without the urge to show us what a great job the guys and gals at the prop and FX departments have done . Oh bravo - but this is superfluous to the plot and nobody likes to see a show off One curious aspect Besson has done is to bring one of the most uneven casts ever assembled for a movie . No doubt Besson will claim it's an eclectic mix but I have to stick to my guns and say it's uneven . Ian Holm is totally convincing as is the late John Bennet who played Holm's predecessor at the start of the movie and as you might expect most of the best performances come from British equity members . Bruce Willis is Bruce Willis but was no doubt cast in order to make the movie appeal to an American audience . Tricky is a strange casting choice but holds his own while Oldman's accent is very irritating , I don't mean unconvincing I mean irritating . Without doubt the worst performance belongs to Chris Tucker who nearly brings the fim down Like the cast THE FIFTH ELEMENT is very uneven . It has a great opening 15 minutes then becomes just another flashy overblown futuristic fantasy and long before the final credits rolled I wished that the producers had developed the opening into a 100 minute feature film set in North Africa circa 1914",

Along with an ex forces cab driver and a priest called Cornellius, Leeloo must piece it together before the end of mankind arrives.Depending on which side of the fence you sit on, The Fifth Element is either a child fantasy made by an adult, or an adult fantasy made by a child! Here in lies the problem that many critics and movie watchers can't agree on. Just what does Luc Besson's film want to be? Having conceived the concept for his film at a very early age, Besson I think waited until he was comfortable with his adult eyes, and armed with the technological advancements in the late 90s, to realise his vision. With the result being a beautiful piece of science fiction that is, yes- cartoonish in every other frame.Crucial though is that Besson's futuristic vision of New York dominates proceedings, not even a villain overdrive from Gary Oldman can detract from the colourful vistas that Besson has crafted. The sea has dropped and New York is awash with flying cars, there are no take aways anymore, the Chinese junks fly to your front door to serve you food, how cool is that? Shape shifting aliens are amongst us, who in the context of this Jean-Paul Gautier clothed universe, blend in effortlessly, and opera divas are strangely beautiful and blue creatures. In short, the film is an art direction treat, a feast for the eyes, even as the comedy and action take control in the final third.Bruce Willis quickly leaves behind his successful trip to harder edged roles (Twelve Monkeys) to play super cabbie Korben Dallas. Gun toting and with a quip at every turn, this is the Willis that the MTV generation loves and adores. Oldman, for better or worse as Zorg, gives a memorable performance (oh my, is that a Southern American accent?), but it's with Mila Jovovich (Leeloo) that the film gets its acting spurs. A pure revelation, it begs the question on why Jovovich has failed to progress in the acting world? (stop doing tripe like Resident \"will work for food\" Evil films would be a good start).Sci-fi fans will obviously get the point that the support cast features Ian Holm (Alien) and Brion James (Blade Runner), which off sets the annoying and painful turn from Chris Tucker as zany, insecure DJ Ruby Rhod (is Besson having a pop at world DJs here I wonder?). To leave us with what? A film that mildly suffers from its director giving way to his heart over his head, but hey baby, it's one groovy and enjoyable romp from start to finish regardless. 8/10",

            "content": "Okay, I must first point out that Chris Tucker in this film was like a walking and talking migraine. I know to some extent that is EXACTLY what the producers and director wanted, but he was so whiny and nasal I wanted to see him hit by a laser! That's out of my system, so I can go on with my review. This is perhaps the strangest sci-fi movie to come out of Hollywood and starring a first-tier American actor (though the director is French). I might have expected something this strange and risky to come from an independent producer, but for the \"big boys\" to finance such an odd film is quite \"odd\" in itself.Aside from Bruce Willis, whose character seems like just a guy taken out of the 20th century, all other actors in the film seemed strange and other-worldly. This was true for the female lead, Milla Jovovich, who looks a lot like an 80s punk rocker but who speaks a strange foreign language no one other than Willis can understand. But, this strangeness was even more apparent by all the odd creatures that inhabit the film--ranging from a blue-skinned woman with a very odd-shaped head who sings in a sort of alien operatic style to Gary Oldman's thugs who look a lot like,....nothing I have even dreamed of before! The worlds, too, are very very strange and look nothing like the Star Trek or Star Wars worlds--having their own unique look and charm that shows that the film must have cost a ton to make and had a strong commitment by the studio for its completion as the writers had envisioned it.The plot is too difficult to adequately describe in the space I have here. In fact, it would probably be best to just leave that all up to you. Watch it if you are a lover of sci-fi or you are willing to see something VERY unconventional. Otherwise, I doubt if you'll get a lot out of this film, since it is certainly NOT derivative or like anything you've ever seen before (unless you are psychotic or have done some MASSIVELY powerful drugs).",

Chris Tucker is a scream as Ruby Rhod . His manic , over the top persona made him an instant star if he wasn't already .The enigmatic Diva . She who has launched 1000 web sites . We want to know everything about her . Who is she in real life ? Where can you get that wonderful song ? She's nothing less than thrilling . Thankfully there's a new DVD of The Fifth Element that explains many aspects of the Diva as well as the rest of the movie . I highly recommend it .But there's one thing that's missing . Not a complaint exactly . Maybe I really don't want to know . So if you know don't tell me . What in the world is with the Chocolate Syrup that drips down your face when you come in contact with the Super Evil force ? That is weird squared . So enjoy The Fifth Element and Bosco for everyone !",

            "content": "Seriously, this movie was very ahead of its time. I don't know what sprung in the director, but this movie was pure genius. There's so much originality in this and a lot of creativity. You know how when you watch a James Cameron movie and at the end of it you're like \"holy crap, this movie feels as if it came out this year\". Well, this is exactly how I felt about this movie. It's just like a James Cameron movie, way ahead of its time, well, the 90's.The city with the flying cars, floating Chinese take-out, and cigarettes that have the filter backwards, I love this film! I can watch this movie over and over again and it would still feel new to me. Thanks to blu-ray technology, I can see it in beautiful high definition followed by some nice surround sound system.The visuals and special effects were very amazing for a 90's movie. And this is 1997, you wouldn't expect much from movies in the 90's in terms of nice special effects, with the exception of T2. But this movie delivered on a massive scale.Gary Oldman is the villain. Not the brightest villain, but he's cool. We have cameo appearances from trip hop artist, Tricky, as Gary Oldman's sidekick I guess? Bruce Willis, one of my favorite actors plays the role of the sarcastic action hero. He pairs up with the hot and sexy Milla Jonovich. That scene where she was created by the machines got me a little excited cause she's just so sexy. Chris Tucker is in it and he's just such a goof. It's kinda hard to tell whether he's straight or gay because of weird fashion the world of the Fifth Element serves its citizens, but nonetheless, it fit the world, because it needed something new.The plot is another save the world from the bad guy scenario, with a twist. You have this deadly planet coming for earth, which looks like an asteroid, but apparently the planet speaks because it's alien, and the main group of hero's must gather all the stones which would be placed in a temple in Egypt to stop the impending attack on earth. You have a gang of mercenary-type aliens who can shape-shift into humans and use any means of violence to accomplish their goals.The main group of hero's are also joined by a priest by British actor, Sir Ian Holm, who does a phenomenal job on his part. The worlds and locations in this film are just stunning and beautiful, it's like you wish the world looked like that today, but sadly it doesn't look anything close to what the Fifth Element looked like.Overall, this movie gets a 10/10 for originality, creativity, and stunning visuals. If you haven't seen this, then you should, because this should be on the list of movies you should watch before you die. Buy this movie, it's worth every penny. I look at other sci-films today that involve a similar plot and I can't enjoy it as much as I enjoyed this movie. I wish the director had the ambition to make a sequel for this, because it's under-rated. Long live the Fifth Element.",

            "content": "I find it hilarious that most of the people that have left comments on this movie either HATE the film or LOVE the film.  There's only a few people that say \"It's alright\".I saw this movie when it first came out in the theaters and hadn't bothered seeing it again till last night, and I'd have to say that I liked it even less this time around.To be perfectly honest, I thought it was a HORRIBLE movie!  I don't really get why anyone would like it.  The story is horrible, the music terribly mis-placed, the comedy is just dumb and the characters are lame.Ok, so the \"Fifth Element\" is this alleged \"perfect being\" (Milla Jovovich)? I'm sorry...but STUPID!!!  And while I'm on the subject, why does everyone like Milla so much?  Don't get me wrong, she's a fine actress and an ok looker, but for this \"perfect being\" couldn't they get someone more-perfect than Milla, I guess I just wasn't terribly impressed with her looks.  Ok, back to what I was saying about the plot...there is this big ball of \"evil\" coming towards the earth?  Again...STUPID!!!  They didn't even attempt to explain what the HELL this big ball of evil is or where it came from or why it was headed toward earth.  Maybe I just missed something in the film, but it didn't make any sense to me.Ok, I have to mention this now, How on earth can anyone say that Chris Tucker's character was interesting...no wait...tolerable?  Chris' character was GOD-AWFUL!!!  Screaming like a little whiny bitch every 5 seconds!  His character was utterly useless, his character could have EASILY been cut out of the film and it would have made a MUCH better film.The only other character that I hated just as much as Chris Tucker's was the president of the federation.  The casting person should be shot!  Why did they choose Tommy 'Tiny' Lister as the president?  He looks like a cross-eyed retarded thug!  I just couldn't accept that this guy was the president, ANYONE else would have fit-the-mold better than this guy.As for Gary Oldman, I thought he did a fine job with the character he played, but what was with all that lame-ass wardrobe?  What was with that stupid plastic thing on the one side of his head.  I just couldn't buy it, I thought it was dumb looking.  And while I'm thinking of it, what the HELL was up with that stupid looking animal thing that Gary Oldman had in his office when he almost choked near the beginning of the film?  It looked like something you'd see in a Flintstones movie (no disrespect to the Flintstones).  I just thought it was SO out of place and SO un-needed.Also, I couldn't stand those aliens that had the egg shaped ship in the beginning of the film.  I couldn't stand their little heads, their enormous shoulders, and how slow they moved.  I didn't get it, were they aliens or robots or aliens in robotic suits or what?I didn't really have any problem with the Ian Holm character or Bruce Willis', but those were the only two that I could easily tolerate.I WILL give some kudos to the special effects department, IMPRESSIVE!!!  In fact, I'm actually considering buying this movie just for the special effects, they're really quite good.  But sadly, that's the only thing it's got going for it.You know, I like just about every sci-fi movie that comes along and I'm not kidding, I like just about everything, but I really DIDN'T like this film. It had a few good ideas, but it just seemed like they gave a 5 year-old a whole lot of money to make a movie.  Overall, I'm not going to stop you from seeing this movie, come to your own conclusion, but it was just dumb.  I hope you enjoy the film more than I did.  Until next time,-Cortex",

            "content": "Luc Besson shows again why he was one of the most stylish and innovative directors of the nineties with this effort. Bringing together a wildly varied cast, from action stars to stage actors to supermodels to cult heroes, and putting them in a genre defying film about the salvation of earth in the future, he gives one of the most visually impressive films of the era, as well as one of the most entertaining.The story begins in the early 20th century with an archaeologist and friend uncovering proof of aliens, and of a mysterious fifth element, the only thing capable of saving the world from destruction. Aliens arrive and take the apparent device, leaving Luke Perry to pass on the secret through the generations. Flash forward a few centuries and we meet a group of scientists who have found the Fifth Element. It is a beautiful young woman, and half the galaxy is after her, including evil aliens, and the tyrannical Gary Oldman. The young woman escapes, only to literally crash into washed up taxi driver and ex soldier Bruce Willis. She speaks in an alien language, but together they find Ian Holm, a descendant of the original archaeologist. Thus begins a frantic race to save the world from an approaching black ball of shadow, while protecting the fifth element from capture.The film has much to give- the sets, effects, and costumes are all wonderful, giving one of the best visions of the future since Blade Runner, and borrowing many ideas from such sci-fi classics. There are brilliant performances from all, though Oldman, Johovich, and Tucker stand out. The film is bursting with ideas and imagination, there are many funny moments, and the message that love can conquer all, though slightly glossy, is still relevant. At times bizarre, but always highly watchable, the Fifth Element is a film which everyone with a heart and soul should enjoy, or at least find something worthwhile in it. 9 out of 10.",

The FX are here sometimes and look good. Other than that, this is an ugly movie. The colors are poor. Also, the acting is quite wooden too. Bruce Willis is just phoning it in here. Gary Oldman....what can I say? What is he doing here? He not only looks ridiculous, but is not menacing at all. One of the least convincing villains ever. This movie also drags along slowly. SLOWLY. So slow and boring that I fell asleep while watching this. I woke up.....it's still on! Ick. This movie is also too long. The main problem: Freaking boring.The Last Word: Just plain bad.

It has got effects of all kind, but nothing more. From that, it's empty. I saw this movie at it's release and didn't like it. I've seen it again, and I still don't like it. I've also kind of \"imagined\" the effects away, and found a big hole. The acting is terrible. Except for Gary Oldman, who were hysteric and hilarious and Ian Holm, God he's great! Even though, I can't believe what he's doing in this trash. He's a quality-actor for God's sake! Well now. Bruce Willis was ok, but poor Milla what-ever-her-name-is was totaly awful.I believe Chris Rock, oh, I mean Chris Tucker (they are like twins) is in this movie. Seeing him, and thinking that it's really a movie by Luc Besson, who's got style, is sickening. This movie is plastic, folks! Not the usual Besson-style as in \"Nikita\", \"Leon\" and \"Le grand bleu\".\nBesson's worst. 6/10 (and a six is pretty poor for a movie like this)",

            "content": "In \"The Fifth Element,\" we learn that every 5000 years evil returns from the deepest reaches of outer space to try to wipe out all life in the universe. Only the Four Classic Greek Elements (Earth, Fire, Water, and Wind) plus a \"fifth\" element - the \"supreme being\" - can ward off this evil presence.And so begins \"The Fifth Element,\" French filmmaker Luc Besson's (\"La Femme Nikita,\" \"The Professional\") lavish nod to the sci-fi genre. I contend that not a whole lot of science fiction is high on intelligence, but Besson's film is not only high on intelligence, but imagination. With plenty of beautiful special effects, sights, sounds, story, perfectly chosen actors and Eric Serra's fitting score, \"The Fifth Element\" is pure sci-fi fun at the movies, the likes of which haven't been seen in a long time.\"The Fifth Element\" is simply an extravagant tale of good vs. evil in the realm of the science fiction genre. Besson began work on the screenplay while in high school, and the self-contained universe he creates is brought to life here flawlessly. Most filmmakers when trying to bring an outrageous fantasy to life on the screen tend to get lost in the fantasy, short-changing actors and story for special effects. For the most part, the actors chosen - Bruce Willis, Gary Oldman, Ian Holm, and others - are alive & kicking, and not cardboard cut-outs. I'm not saying that they're contenders for the Oscars, but you get my assertion that they are far better (and smarter) than most of the characters you typically find in most science fiction adventure fantasies, and are not stock or background to special effects and pulse-pounding action sequences.As I stated earlier, in New York City 300 years into the future (the 23rd century, I believe), evil - a great, big fireball named (named!) \"Mr. Shadow\" - is on its way to wipe out all life in the universe. So it's up to his Earthbound lackey Zorg (Oldman, over-the-top, as usual) and his alien-warrior minions to track down and obtain four stones representing the elements (Earth, Fire, Water, and Wind). But before that happens, we learn that cab driver Korben Dallas (Willis) has obtained the fare of a lifetime - the perfectly beautiful and perfectly dangerous redhead Leeloo (Milla Jovovich) - who literally crash-lands in the back of his cab after she was first regenerated from a scratch of alien DNA in a laboratory. It's love at first sight, but their relationship troubles are hampered by the fact that she's wanted by the police after escaping from said lab and the fact that she speaks an unknown extraterrestrial language.After eluding the cops, Dallas, a former soldier-of-fortune, takes Leeloo to Priest Cornelius (Holm), who realizes exactly who (and what) Leeloo is and what her role in saving the world is - she's the supreme being, the fifth element. So now Korben, under the guise of winning a contest to the outer-world Phloston Paradise, along with Cornelius and Leeloo, sets out to - what else is there to do? - save the world, with Zorg and his minions in hot pursuit.\"The Fifth Element,\" considering its production and the outrageousness of the story, should not be as good as it is. This is a beautiful-looking picture, eschewing the usual post-apocalyptic gloominess that's associated with futuristic science fiction movies for a marvelously shiny (and remarkably clean!) future-world New York. But Besson is a great storyteller, and knows what he wants on his picture. His script (co-authored with Robert Mark Kamen) is intelligently and expertly written, with strong, believable characters and perfectly composed dialogue that doesn't lose itself in meaningless diatribe and ludicrous explanations of trying to figure out what's going on. And it also contains enough action, humor (provided mostly in the second half by comedian Chris Tucker as flamboyant radio personality Ruby Rhod), intelligence, a performance by a blue-skinned alien opera singer named Diva Plavalaguna, and romance (yes, romance, and you thought it was just another brainless sci-fi picture) to ensure that it remains accessible even to those who don't care much for this science fiction/fantasy stuff.The film flies through its plot, arriving at a climax that is action-packed and shows off the same European action-chic that made Besson a household name with his earlier \"Nikita\" and \"Professional.\" In these action sequences on-board the Phloston Paradise cruise ship, there are explosions, gunfights with alien beasts, martial arts, and a special effects finale that has to be seen to be believed, but at the same time may be a little bit of a disappointment for those expecting a bigger payoff. And while the humor can draw in those uninterested in this sci-fi/fantasy stuff, it can at times be a little silly and inappropriate and take away from the adventure.\"The Fifth Element\" is certainly one of the best and most imaginative pieces of original science fiction fanfare produced in a long time. That a sharp director such as Luc Besson was able to get behind the camera of his own little world and not lose himself in it shows that he's a capable filmmaker who's perfectly in control of his film-making elements.9/10",

This Ultimate Evil apparently threatens the Earth every 500 years, the most recent attack being in 1987 when Jethro Tull won the Grammy for Best Heavy Metal Album.Never mind that of the 116 confirmed elements, the fifth element is boron (its atomic number being 5, denoting it has 5 protons in the atom's nucleus \u0096 sorry, I forgot the majority of people still believe in angels and astrology and in superstitions dating from 500 BC which identified only four elements that constitute the cosmos \u0096 didn't mean to bring SCIENCE into a fiction based on science\u0085), in a world where supermodel Milla Jovovich fights evil whilst being 96-percent naked, I'll run with her being the Fifth Element.It's up to THE SLAMMIN' Bruce Willis, playing Korben Dallas playing Bruce Willis, an ex-army, devil-may-care flying-cab driver, to keep nekkid alien Leeloo (Jovovich) out of danger and out of clothes. Hitching a ride to Planet Phloston \u0096 for seemingly no reason other than to flex Digital Domain's special effects muscles - he must battle aliens that look like bulldogs, put his hand into the innards of a singer who looks like a vacuum cleaner and try to avoid - THE GLAMMIN' Ruby Rhod (Chris Tucker), an interstellar DJ who looks like a transsexual Chris Rock.Then there's THE HAMMIN' Gary Oldman: he's done a junkie Pistol, he's done a gay playwright, he's done a deaf Austrian composer, he's done a blood-drinking undead version of Brad Pitt; here, he is Jean-Baptiste Emanuel Zorg, an interstellar black market arms dealer with a Bible Belt drawl \u0096 is there anything this actor can't do? To bring about the end of existence as we know it, The Ultimate Evil must work through Zorg's company, for which Zorg charges the usual agent's fee of 10-percent. 10-percent of the end-of-existence-as-we-know-it works out to about Canada.Even though the mysticism of a prophecy engines this movie's plot, Besson has unabashedly crafted a popcorn-and-bullets action-adventure comedy and obviously regards it as such, never for an instant threatening to tread philosophical, scientific or preachy ground; paradoxes, non-science, plot holes and cheap neoperene monster makeup flying hither and thither.There's something for all three sexes here: Korben Dallas for the ladies, Leeloo for the guys and Ruby Rhod for the girly-men.(Movie Maniacs, visit: poffysmoviemania.com)",

            "content": "This sci-fi actioner is a cut above the rest thanks to a superior script, strong acting, a great cast and buckets of style from French director Luc Besson, also responsible for the wonderful Leon. Besson's flamboyant direction helps to paint a colourful and interesting futuristic world which has a very distinct look and feel to it, one which is enhanced by a funky score and eye-catching costumes designed by none other than a top French fashion designer, Jean-Paul Gaultier. Whilst the story is basic stuff, and done before, it has never been done like this.Themes of originality (the five elements combining to combat the menace is great stuff and check out the excellent ending in which the participants must figure out how to work the magic stones) surface throughout and there are plenty of bizarre situations you won't see elsewhere. A tongue-in-cheek approach means that there's plenty of comedy to enjoy, most of it stemming from the bizarre and flamboyant characters crossing the screen. Constant action and furthering of the plot results in a film you can't take your eyes off in an instant in fear of missing something - the fast pacing is incredible and at a normal speed the action in this movie would probably take about twice as long to unfold.Bruce Willis stars in one of his last action hero roles before giving up on the genre and it's one of his best, most mannered performances, his wisecracking, everyday macho man hero a fine creation and his performance fabulous. But then he has to be good, otherwise the other actors would overshadow him. There's Ian Holm, all nervousness and unintentional comedy as a heroic priest; Gary Oldman playing probably the weirdest bad guy role of his movie career (check out the bizarre plastic covering that covers half of his skull and the lank, dyed back hair on the other size, not to mention the huge collar and colours of his costume); finally Milla Jovovich makes a stunning debut performance playing an alien and makes the film her own, an almost tragic, fragile yet incredibly strong creature who evolves from being a nonsense-speaking child into a controlled kung-fu fighting heroine.The rest of the supporting cast comprise familiar faces appearing in bit parts (Luke Perry, John Neville, Charlie Creed-Miles, rubber-faced funnyman Lee Evans) with special mention going to Chris Tucker, as the hateable, intensely irritating transvestite DJ who sounds like he's high on helium, and the late, great Brion James in one of the final roles of his career as General Munro - boy, had he aged since his appearances in the early '90s. The special effects are authentic-looking whilst being spectacular at the same time, whether it be huge interstellar explosions or weird morphing effects. The action includes flying car chases, a race against a ticking bomb and my favourite sequence, an incredibly-staged hotel ballroom shoot-out which must be one of the best ever filmed.There's so much more - the ugly alien mutants, the sweating president, opera, and lots of surprises plus a touch of pathos here and there (Jovovich discovering about human warfare is a surprisingly touching, moving moment, underplayed and deeply affecting scene). Altogether a great comic book sci-fi movie of the '90s.Now it's time for a proviso: I saw this film at the age of 16, when I wrote the above review. Some twenty years later I recently rewatched it and discovered that I liked it much less than I did originally; the overblown nature of the movie was annoying more often than not. I think THE FIFTH ELEMENT is very much a film of its era which looked cool and snazzy in the 1990s but has largely dated since then, so my rating reflects that.",

            "content": "I've seen The Fifth Element several times now, at least four or five, and I still can't say what it is find strangely appealing about it; I just can't bring myself to say that it's bad, though I don't consider it a spectacular(or even mediocre) achievement in cinema. The film is carried by an insurmountable amount of mix-ups between the various characters, and almost nothing else, which can be considered a strong argument both for and against the movie's quality; for, since it's somewhat of an achievement, against, since it should(arguably) be a more worthwhile line of situations that keep a movie going. The characters are almost all clich\u00e9s, especially the main characters, and there is nothing in the movie to outweigh that; however, somehow, it didn't matter too much, much like the plot being carried by mix-ups. The dialog is no crowning achievement either; neither is the action. So what is it exactly that draws people to this film, and works on so many levels, and is liked by so many? Frankly, I have no idea. It just does. Perhaps Luc Besson took a degree in psychology, and is somehow affecting our subconscious with the film; who knows. The acting is mostly good. Bruce Willis is good enough as Dallas, though his character(and acting) is mostly derived from all of the other smart, wise-cracking, well-trained and skilled characters he's played in the past. The science fiction elements of the film are sometimes spectacular, sometimes a little weird, but mostly entirely unbelievable; and I'm almost certain that's how Besson wanted it. What carries the film is the humor in it; every single scene has some humor in it, and it overshadows everything else. This is mostly a good thing, though, as it works, most of the time. The timing and gags are great, not tired, worn out, or forced, as they are with plenty of Hollywood productions. I thoroughly enjoyed the cross-cutting segments of the film, they were some of the best parts of the film, and delivered some of the best laughs. One thing that thoroughly annoyed me, was Chris Tucker's character; he was constantly irritating, and obviously(like many of the other main characters) he was mainly there to contribute to the mix-ups and the humor. I would've liked the film more, had there been something more...what's the word... \"Hollywood\", I guess. It's just annoying when there aren't really any characters that we truly care about, and just about all of the main characters mainly are there to make us laugh. All in all, an oddly appealing film, but too many shortcomings and distractions to be entirely enjoyable. I recommend this to... hmmm... that's a tough one; I can't really say who'll enjoy the film, actually. I suppose fans of Besson and his earlier work might enjoy it, but pretty much everybody should give it a try. It's hard to tell who'll like it and who won't. 7/10",

You try and imagine anyone else in his role. It's impossible.The film rarely takes itself serious, even though the subject matter is pretty serious and quite romantic. Even when nothing is happening, there is something going on. It's a veritable red bull of a pop music video, and multiple viewings offer something new and fresh each time.Old man is on bad guy duty, and, just like Air Force One, he's pleasingly unlikable, and pretty likeable at the same time. He's taken notes from Rickman's Sheriff of Nottingham, and taken it into outer space.The set pieces are wonderful, and the film is almost one big set piece, as the act structure has truly been thrown out of the window. The Stand out set piece is on Fhloston Paradise. It's so exciting, quite funny, and pretty genius.If you're looking for something that you can both concentrate on and at the same time not really taking any attention to it, then this is the perfect movie. You know it's something special, something that couldn't be made today, as it seems that all originality has flown away.",

            "content": "2257: the future of humanity is in jeopardy: powerful evil forces are menacing the overpopulated planet, only a congregation of priests anticipated that (gruesome) eventuality since 1914 when aliens took away stones representing the four elements. Where else than an Egyptian temple would a legitimate fantasy/sci-fi epic start? Only a fifth element in the form of a supreme being would liberate the stones' power to save humanity.Now, give that premise to Ridley Scott or Denis Villeneuve and they'd turn it into a grand and bicolor voyage into the hearts of interstellar darkness... with mystical undertones. But Luc Besson decided to make the whole thing totally bonkers. Indeed, when the aliens meet the Egyptologist (John Bluthal), his question is \"are you Germans?\" the tone is set. Poor man hasn't time to see the light (not from Aziz anyway), he is put into eternal sleep, his assistant (Luke Perry) can't oppose any effective resistance either. A three-century leap and a quick battle between the cosmic enemy and the Federation army later, the one survivor is technologically revived: it's a young androgynous woman with orange hair.All indicate that she is the fifth element. She has super fighting skills and manages to escape and fall in the taxicab belonging to Korben Dallas (Bruce Willis). What else, do we have? A President (Tommy \"Tiny\" Lister Jr.) talking like Marcellus Wallace on valium, an over-the-top and sassy deejay, a blue Opera-singing creature ... \"The Fifth Element\" contains at least fifty elements of awesomeness with the set-design and practical effects of a legitimate sci-fi film, making it a unique and epic space opera... with rock'n'roll. It is weird, funny, but never nonsensical.It was Luc Besson's baby, and yes, only a mind high on excessive imagination could conceive such a crazy story, but after a dreadfully slow 'serious' Golden palm winner, I was craving for that. I had fun following \"The Fifth Element\" and all the campiness of the world can't conceal its greatness, in fact it justifies it. Sci-fi has become the canvas for so many dark and gloomy films that I'm glad Besson put colors in them, made it fast-paced, spectacular and entertaining, almost dwarfing the 'classics'. Ian Holm as the priest and his cowardly assistant (Charlie Creed-Miles). Milla Jovovich as the lovely Lee-Loo, every character is fun and strangely endearing.In a French TV show, Yann Moix paid tribute to Jean-Claude Van Damme saying that \"B-movie is an art\". There is no proud cinephile who can't indulge to these little guilty pleasures, and just because the product is junk doesn't mean the package isn't worth the attention. And of course Luc Besson, one of the 'bad boys' of 'cinema du look', along with Beinex or Carax, was among those who put the final nail of the Nouvelle Vague when it was agonizing in its own pretentiousness. A 'Star Wars' alumni milked with American blockbusters and figuring some day \"why can't France do that?\". Besson crystallized the intelligentsia anger, accusing him of making Hollywood ersatz. Besson hated artsy films and figured there was more merit to make big-budgeted spectacles than two hours of people talking in the kitchen. Was he wrong?But if Besson made commercial films, he never considered the seriousness of a subject as antidotes against action or fun. His style was vibrant, exuberant at times but there was a heart at the right place. Still, \"Fifth Element\" is the result of a totally different mindset, this is a film he claimed to have designed in his teens, he had the vision but as an insecure French boy, he would have felt lucky to make it beyond comic-level. In a way, the film is a comic-strip, each vignette has a purpose, a background event, a capability to surprise you with what comes after. The bad guy finds his box empty, cut to the heroine laughing. The timing is awkward but we get the point: she's explaining why it is and so we're never one step ahead of the characters. Or just take the entrance of Ruby Rhodes (Christ Tucker), by the time you wonder 'what the hell is that?', he's already in in the adventure.Each scene is like Besson tapping your shoulder and telling you, wait you haven't seen anything yet. It's a continuous treat to the eyes, a sort of \"Blade Runner\" made out of ecstasy where you can tell everyone has fun doing it, from director to the actor to even Gary Oldman who said he didn't want to do the film but accepted because financed his \"Nil by Mouth\". As Zorg (a name so clich\u00e9 it's meta-hilarious) Oldman delivers one of these performances so ludicrous that it takes a certain genius to never make them badly laughable. As Dallas, Bruce Willis is perfect as the straight guy to the whole comedy, not exactly a loner with a secret past, when LeeLoo falls on his car, he's obviously smitten by her and when he hears that hypnotic voice from the Opera singer (Ma\u00efwenn), his expression contains his best silent acting.The scope if epic, stakes are high and Besson just pushes the envelope to the max, keeping many great momentums in the film, opera intercut with fighting against the Mangalores (extra-terrestrial bounty hunters with limited cognitive abilities who could have belonged to a Star-Trek film), a climax reminding of Captain Planet, Besson finds an element of unpredictability in predictable situation and even something as mundane as boarding in an airport had me repeating \"Multipass\". Multipass, I like that word, it fits the film, it's an extended MTV Video clip but with a delightful self-awareness, breathtaking visuals, spectacular effects... and a good story.In a way, it encapsulates the best that cinema can offer you, and this is why I dedicated it my IMDb 2000th review.",

I really don't know what Luc Besson was trying to achieve here, but whatever it was, unless it was to make a cinematic migraine, it didn't work.

In my opinion it is Bruce Willis best sci-fi action flick. I always loved this sci-fi action packed flick and I always will. I watch it more than 20.times in the row. This movie is amazing. I realized this year I think that the protagonist and antagonist never meet, and I think that's awesome. This movie has too many awesome aspects to list, and it's one of those movies where I get sad when the end credits come on. And it makes me angry that a movie so awesome doesn't get talked about. I got to look up the screenwriter and see what else they have done because movies this awesome are rare. I just love the look (cinematography), the cast, the special effects, the acting, the costumes (Jean-Paul Gaultier...just excellent stuff), the humor, the score. I remember that everybody in the movie theatre was completely silent when the blue alien was singing:) The Fifth Element will always be my favorite Sci-Fi movie, I will always enjoy this movie, it is gun and Entertaining. Movies like this one they aren't today anymore. I also love the film. It's a lot of fun. Love the cast, effects and music. It is a dam good movie. It has very well-made CGI effects that looks so breathtaking, great story, good characters especially Bruce Wills and Milla Jovovich. The use of miniatures, and prosthetics, then the added layer of CGI is what creates a more believable image. This movie was shot more than 18 years ago and still looks good and better than the films coming out today! A surprisingly awesome action scenes, funny dialogue, everything! I was amazed how this film was gonna turn out back then, considering the comparison with \"Star Wars\". Luc Besson also gave us such classics as The Professional. Fifth Element sees Bruce Willis as the reluctant hero who is thrust into protecting Milla Jovovich who happens to be such the 5th element before the evil Zorg played by Gary Oldman finds her for his own master purposes. Filled with stunning visual effects and some good old fashioned adventure this one is still as fun to watch now as it was back in '97. Luc Besson really stood out from the trend. It has to be said that back in 1997 it was all about the Fifth Element, an amazing French blockbuster which people eventually got tired of... Strangely enough, it was coldly received in the US. It's so different in many ways, the visual aspect is brilliant, the cast is great (featuring bigwigs Ma\u00efwenn and Mathieu Kassovitz as the robber) and too few Sci-Fi movies can claim to be funny and entertaining.The Things I have enjoyed was a wonderful humor, great special effects and memorable characters who create a brilliant tongue in cheek a Sci- Fi flick! That you will find worth watching the fifth time as much as the first. I love about everything that is in this film./: Before Milla Jovovich became Alice in Resident Evil Series she was Leeloo The Fifth Element. The action is very gore I am surprised that this movie was rated PG-13. Gary Oldman as Jean-Baptiste Emanuel Zorg did an outstanding acting performance in the movie I have ever seen. Gary Oldman also played in The Professional (1994) action thriller flick with Jean Reno. Timeless: Good versus Evil, with a little romance and ass-kicking thrown in for good measure! Set design and costumes are awesome, the characters are priceless (Chris Tucker!), this movie is just a lot of fun to watch! Sadly Luc Besson does not make any good movies today like is this one The Fifth Element.New York cab driver Korben Dallas didn't mean to be a hero, but he just picked up the kind of fare that only comes along every five thousand years: A perfect beauty, a perfect being, a perfect weapon. Now, together, they must save the world. Bruce Willis, Milla Jovovich, and Gary Oldman star in acclaimed director Luc Besson's outrageous sci-fi adventure, an extravagantly styled tale of good against evil set in an unbelievable twenty-third century world. This movie is what it is, a perfect 10, because it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors on Earth, and realizes them almost perfectly with all the tools that fit the task -- actors, stunts, puppetry, models, and CGI.The Fifth Element (French: Le Cinqui\u00e8me \u00c9l\u00e9ment) is a 1997 English-language French science fiction action film directed and co-written by Luc Besson. It stars Bruce Willis, Gary Oldman and Milla Jovovich.10/10 Grade: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval Studio: Gaumont Buena Vista International, Columbia Pictures Starring: Bruce Willis, Gary Oldman, Milla Jovovich, Ian Holm, Chris Tucker Director: Luc Besson Producer: Patrice Ledoux Screenplay: Luc Besson, Robert Mark Kamen Story by Luc Besson Rated: PG-13 Running Time: 2 Hrs. 06 Mins.

            "content": "Probably, the rating of the movie is such low, because it is not a serious science fiction, otherwise, it is one of the most enjoyable and colorful science fiction movies ever made and if you ask me, humor in it is not uneven. By the way, Fifth Element is one of my all time favorite science fiction movies. However, it is clearly seen that almost many people don't appreciate it and some find it ridiculous. The science fiction movies that made after 2000 were mostly disappointing such as Mission to Mars, Red Planet, Sunshine etc. As for Pitch Black, it was good, but forgettable. What I am trying to say is that to make a successful science fiction movie is not that easy. The plot of the movie is not deep may be, but creative and not childish. There are a few scenes I love and watched hundreds of times, because never felt enough. The first one is the scene which Leeloo jumps over, the following part is extremely enjoyable. Willis's car is one of my favorite engines in movies and the blue ones also, the design of them is very appealing like some other designs. My second favorite is the song part, in my opinion legendary, the song was reposeful and the scene was inventive. The third one is the best action scene of the movie, the gunfight scene at the saloon of the ship. Lots of people hate the character Ruby Rhod, almost everyone who has seen the movie talks about him like he ruined the movie, I liked the movie except for Ruby Rhod etc. This is really sad. He was an extremely funny and amusing character and Chris Tucker does not look superficial and his best performance so far as well. Therefore, I LIKED him. By the way, the movie is sometimes called Die Hard in space, I agree. Some designs in the movie seem childish, kitsch or flimsy like the gun of Zorg, his 'toys' in his office, the head of Diva or the monsters, but it is great fun, does not ruin the movie somehow and also it is made consciously that's the point. As mentioned, some say what a fake movie! No it is not. In contrast, visual effects of the space ships and the planets are first class. By the way, the creatures are also interesting characters and so fun to watch. The afro American guy who changes his face was a so popular and unforgettable image, still it is, if you ask me. Milla Jovovich is really a talented actress and her best performance is in this movie like Chris Tucker. As many people haven't done, I haven't forgotten ''multi-pass''. The laboratory scene is brilliant, so is her performance and every time, I bother so that her waist will broke. The city in the movie is extremely dazzling, one of the most well created cities in cinema. This is a rare thing that in a movie, every actor makes one of their bests, some of them make their best, but completely different characters from each other. As for Gary Oldman, he is one of the actors who can play every kind of character. He is almost as funny as Rhod and very interesting, amusing character, especially his accent.",

            "content": "Comedic science fiction-adventure from Luc Besson, with a screenplay Besson co-wrote based upon on a story he originally devised in his teenage years, shows definite signs the filmmaker was entranced--as were we all--with \"Star Wars\" and \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\". Unfortunately, Besson doesn't possess the canny, joshing touch of a Lucas or Spielberg, who were also derivative within these genres yet more commercially-viable. Besson doesn't have a clue how to warm up an audience, and one cannot watch a film like \"The Fifth Element\" without counting off all the movie references (a little \"Blade Runner\" here, a bit of \"Die Hard\" there). Bruce Willis, as a Brooklyn cabbie in the 23rd century, is still doing his John McClane schtick--unshaven and gruffly adorable, with a punky-blonde shock of hair. After a gibberish-speaking punk-waif female drops into his taxi, Willis' Korben Dallas becomes involved in a search for four mystical stones which are imperative in preventing world destruction. Obviously, the art direction and design of this thing are amazing; yet, on another level, it merely looks like an inordinate amount of money and imagination wasted on a dime-novel yarn, a futuristic-noir (one with irritating changing music cues, from rock to reggae to opera). For those who stick with it, the finale--after Besson has dispensed with the redundant gunfire and explosions--manages to come together effectively, though the picture still doesn't leave its audience with much beyond a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. *1/2 from ****",

            "content": "I watched a lot of (Besson)'s movies, as a writer, director, or even producer, sometimes all at once, and I felt how the man was trying to take the action entertaining cinema to the next level, and how also his sense of humor is so lost!In his entire career, he couldn't pull off one masterly joke. Yes, the action is all here and aspirant, but there is that certain amount of silliness around. (Milla Jovovich) was funny but not that funny! (Bruce Willis) was right in between the 2 phases of the old lively comic Willis (Moonlighting's type) and the later cold unfunny Willis (The Whole Nine Yards)'s one, or to tell you the truth, in here he maybe passed it to the second phase already! (Chris Tucker) is TOTALLY UNBEARABLE to say the least, this guy really must own a secret to be in movies till now and to have his name over Jackie Chan's name and bigger salary also in their average franchise \"Ruch Hour\"?? He lost the Razzie award for that year because it went to the only one who could be more awful: (Dennis Rodman) in (Double Team)! Even fine actor with many faces like (Gary Oldman) hackneyed himself to the utmost with no profit, or for the sake of making any kind of attractive and distinct evil character; the same case you would find it again in (Besson)'s less silly, more appeal, same stupid (Leon)!Whenever (Besson) put his touch, everything becomes madcap, horrendous, and most of all ridiculous. I liked the main idea as good plot for: \"you must save the world my son\" + \"Shoot 'Em Up\" kind of video game. As a bonus this time, (Besson) assures that: being spiritual is needed (which's a great and rare message indeed), the woman is the basic element, and how the hero must be American to sell your action flick internationally!The whole movie was forced or graceless which exposed the story as too empty. The dialogue is extremely not droll. The characters are stereotypes with inner-scorn. The ironies are just tasteless. The cartoonish atmosphere was mostly blazing, but lacked wittiness and elegance. The monster creatures weren't scary; maybe that was the point, however they weren't clever or interesting either. The camera's angles looked scary and strangely loved to deform. The performance is all bad (thank God that Ian Holm was there). And the semi-nude outfit of (Jovovich) was so cheap and degrading. As a whole, the movie was ruled by effective repugnant spirit like your classmate who specialized in saying the most non-laughable jokes ever, and desperately continues saying them. Watch carefully just one scene when (Willis) finds no escape from the reporters in every corner; it oozes intolerability with all the meanings of the word. This is perfectly the kind of works that nominates for the Oscar of the best effects, sound effects editing, and doesn't make you laugh or amuse you fully in the same time.(Besson) was so determined on giving it some different style (the operatic singing, Cheb Khaled singing in the background of the flying car chase,..) to present the French contribution in making such blockbusters, but all in all that was relatively influencing factor as the silliness attacked outrageously. It's more like when you love the colors of a drawing and hate, just hate, the drawing itself.In most of his movies, (Besson) wanted to make the forthright American action in the American way to compete with the real American movies. He succeeded in much of this mission, but sorry, he didn't - especially with movies like this one - surpass any of them, despite how (The Fifth Element) was once The most expensive French movie ever made.Objectively, it's loud brainless comic-book, with entertaining detached sequences, if only you can stand its innate ridiculousness. Subjectively, I was hoping for the ending since I was in the movie's middle! In best cases, I consider it a good (Blade Runner)'s spoof, but with no laughs!",

I wonder why she got a razzie nomination, those people who vote for that are really stupid. If anyone should get it it is that president. Oldman was OK as the villain, but not too great.

            "review_title": "Has its moments but is deceiving in its premise",
            "content": "At some point in the decade of the 1990s, almost every big name action star received the opportunity to play an action role in the science fiction genre. Bruce Willis was no different. After starring in three popular entries of the Die Hard (1988) franchise, it was time for Willis to step into the future. In the early 1900s, ancient guardians that had built a machine to protect humans from an evil force that destroys all life (kind of like Galactus) visited Earth. In order to make this weapon of protection work; four stones that represent the four elements must be placed in the temple of which it was created. At the center of it lies the fifth element. Skip 300 years later and viewers see Willis playing Korben Dallas, an ex-military man who currently works as a taxi-driver.It is in this lifetime that Dallas discovers that he will have to save the world by reuniting the five elements together back where they came from. Running parallel to Dallas is Jean-Baptiste Emanuel Zorg (Gary Oldman) who also wants the stones and is in cahoots with the strange nameless evil force. From what was just told, the premise sounds awfully serious. Turns out though, almost nothing is taken zealously. This tone shift is brought on after the brief introduction and it may take some time for viewers to readjust. Adding to that is the writing, which doesn't make a whole lot of sense. First, why does this mythical being want death and destruction to everything living? There has to be some kind of motive. Is it the same motive as Zorg's? That's the closest audiences get to one and it doesn't even come from the evil thing itself.Plus, of all things how did this evil force come into contact with Zorg and why did it choose to work with him personally? Surely there must be other chaotic death hungry villains in this universe. Another weird thing is that every time someone is near this force, they leak black fluid from their head? It doesn't make any sense. Writer/director Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen have both made better works and it shows they weren't catching the mistakes here. Unusually, even though the writing isn't very good, most of the actors give their characters a good amount of quality. Willis makes Dallas very nonchalant and his ability to role off the piling issues, which is a likable trait. Oldman as the evil forces' henchman is comical in some ways due to the manner in which he speaks. Chris Tucker as a popular radio DJ wasn't needed but was funny. Depending on preference, he will either be funny or annoying. Tucker is a polarizing actor when it comes to comedy. Even the late Brion James has a number of funny moments dealing with Willis' role.Perplexing as it may be, Mila Jovovich is the only actor who doesn't have the most likable role. It's not because of her looks or acting ability but more on the development of her character. She speaks another language and can understand English yet can't speak English. With this, the charm of her character isn't very strong. Also, she claims that she exists to protect Dallas when that barely even happens. I don't know, but you'd think that if an actor plays one of the most important plot related roles, they need to be the most likable and developed. Well it doesn't feel that way here. The editing is another issue. The pacing drags frequently, yet editing is done in a way that simultaneously connects all plot threads so that everything collides at once. The beauty of convenience,...but the movie still drags. Sigh. Thankfully, there is some action,...some. When the action hits, it works well. Willis and Tucker produce a number of laughs as the explosions ensue. Even Jovovich has her own fight scene. She looks great but it doesn't last long unfortunately.The visual effects have plus and minuses too. The special/practical effects look well made and for 1997 don't look have bad today either. The best looking features are the futuristic technology in various rooms and the creature makeup. The CGI sequences do look a little shaky but not noticeably bad. However, the cinematography does nothing to visually help the movie. Aside from the futuristic gadgets looking cool, the camera-work is plain and uninteresting. Completing this is composer Eric Serra's music, which only impresses half way. When it came to comedy, Serra's tracks did occasionally improve the scene and make it funnier. Yet for the dramatic moments and other scenes, he continued to use odd sounding instruments and weird overtones. This may draw viewers out of the scene rather than into it. Serra is a very avant garde composer, perhaps a little too much. He didn't even stick to the sci-fi genre of music. Disappointing.It's not a total failure but the entertainment it grants is only half there. The majority of the actors make their characters fun to watch, the action is quick and lively and the comedy is decent. Yet the music is a peculiar audio mix, the pacing is slow and the writing has numerous holes that don't make much sense. It's not unwatchable but it's not that decent either.",

            "content": "The Fifth Element was another one of those mid-late 90s films that helped usher in the age of digital technology. The special effects are dead-on, even for a film that is over 25 years old now. It helps bring to light the Digital Modern Age of filmmaking and paved the way to the CGI intensive Hollywood that we have today. Some would say that is a good thing and some may say that is a bad thing. But, if you can understand the drive of filmmakers, especially SPFX wizards and technical artists, whose challenge is to make things as real as possible, then this needs to happen. If you want your audience to really believe something is real, these advances in technology need to evolve in order to feed a starving audience, looking for next-to-reality, in their stories. The Fifth Element (1997), was one of the pioneers in modern CGI.This is a dark comedy of sorts. It starts out in Egypt in the early 1900s, then heads to a galaxy not too far away. It takes us to a future earth and the life of flying Taxi-Cab driver, Korben Dallas (Willis), as he becomes entrenched in a situation that could save or destroy the world. Along the way, he runs into a beautiful, fiery, mysterious, young woman (Jovovich), with orange-flamed hair, who is involved with something called the fifth element. Many other, strange characters abound in the film.It is an exciting and fun film to look at and has a smattering of comedy, sprinkled throughout. Also, keep an eye on the ever-present color of ORANGE. It represents the ever important aura of the fifth element, as the key ingredient to this film. Also, fresh off of 90210 is Luke Perry as Billy and Chris Tucker gives a head-scratching, but very important performance, as an alien TV personality. This film has it all.

            "content": "A friend of mine once observed that the real problem with The Fifth Element is that it wasn't in French; that had Luc Besson opted to make it in his native tongue all would have been well. He may have a point, but it's still a terribly overoptimistic analysis.The Fifth Element has to be one of the silliest films ever made: the barking mad plot, the comedy villain, the comedy \"bad race\" of Org, the crazy costumes, the crazy music, the Blade Runner with laughs script, the sci-fi icons (like Ian Holm and Brion James). It should be terrible; it is terrible! But it's also marvellous. Marvellously camp, marvellously entertaining and great fun. The difference between this and Big Bruce's Armageddon is that Fifth Element is in on the joke \u0096 in a very in-your-face way, but it is. Contrast near-identical Bruce lines in each film (the \"why d'ya call me\" line). In Armageddon, the question is taken seriously, in Fifth Element they play it for the joke it is \"firstly, out of all of your unit, you're the only one qualified to fly all these space-craft\" - cue the unrolling of an improbably long list - \"secondly, of all of your unit, you're the only one still alive\".This is The Mummy in Space \u0096 two hours of almost unrelenting silliness punctuated with some wonderful pastiches \u0096 the best and the most hilarious being Chris Tucker's Ruby Rhod \u0096 if you didn't realise he's supposed to be Prince it might be classified as ridiculous (what am I saying? It is ridiculous, but it's also bloody marvellous).The genius in this film is really in the casting. Butch Bruce, when left to his own devices, is capable of producing high grade camembert, and once again delivers on that. It's just that here it's so perfect. Ian Holm seems to be rehashing his role in the borrowers rather than Alien. Gary Oldman seems to have been pinching ideas (and costumes) from Max Von Sydow in Flash Gordon. And then there is LeeLoo, the films one original creation, who is played majestically by Milla Jovovich.If it strikes you that I like this film rather too much; well, I agree. I mean, I know this film is trash but it is, nevertheless, the kind of trash people put in a gallery and call art. Surprisingly re-watchable. 6/10.",

There's a good balance between puppets/costumes and CGI. I really dislike it when a production relies on CGI alone to just get by. The futuristic rendition of Earth is big and silly, which is a good break from the dystopia we see from most scifis. Bruce Willis is a legend in the flesh with that signature smirk and cool-guy persona. He was the perfect person for the lead role of this film.Milla Jovovich looks amazing in this film. One of the most unique female characters I've seen in a scifi yet. Her 'birth' inside of the cloning tube reminded me of the similar scene in Metropolis. Chris Tucker is amazingly secure in his flamboyancy, this is probably my favorite role of his.Don't let me forget Gary Oldman as ZORG... He is the real champion of this movie. He's monstrously charming, a class-act bad guy. He has some great one-liners that make me giggle every time.The story is pretty top-notch, as well as the subplots that twist throughout the film. Though, the story for me is a mere footnote. This film's strengths lie in the characters and the music/visuals.Speaking of, The music is extremely diverse and well done for a Scifi. The soundtrack is probably one of the best I've heard period.Luc Besson and crew, you win at scifi.",

It's yet another instance where the audience gets smothered by an avalanche of \"other-movie references,\" which forgets to build its own story or identity. There is a plot, and the cast even seem to be trying to make the most of this thing, but all this is lost amidst the muddled confusion.The comedy relief guy (Chris Rock, probably wishing he had a better agent) is intolerable, more grating than fingernails on chalkboard. This tired clich\u00e9 stereotype swishing around is so awfully unfunny that it must have been the inspiration for the despised Jar Jar Binks a few years later. Mila Javovich is refreshingly better than any of her co-stars, but the script offers insufficient development of her pivotal character. The main bad guy seems to be trying to mix Bugs Bunny with Hannibal Lecter; the result is as bizarre as you might expect.The ending is so hastily pasted together it's embarrassing.

There's some vague wiffling about Evil Ones, but this hardly papers over the gaps.The second, and far more serious negative, is Chris Rock's Ruby Rhod character. The Fifth Element is a sci-fi romp, but Ruby Rhod, also referred to as The Single Most Annoying Character In The Entire History Of Motion Pictures Ever, seems to have been imported from some entirely different movie. It is impossible to describe quite how annoying this character is to anyone who hasn't seen the film: the only way to understand is to experience it, and I wouldn't wish that on anyone. Suffice it to say that the experience of hearing fingernails scraped down a blackboard is euphonious beyond imagining by comparison with Chris Rock's vocal characterisation, and the character's visual aspect is on all fours with the aural.

            "content": "It's probably Luc Besson's best movie (with \"le grand bleu\"). In his movie, he takes back a trendy subject which is to save the world. On this subject that many directors would have surely taken seriously as it was the case with \"Independance day\", Besson introduces a lot of humor into his film. This humor is unexpected, involuntary and  the movie's got funny scenes that are most of the time based on the stroke (like the moment when Bruce Willis is taking Milla Jovovich (the fifth and perfect element) to the priest( Ian Holm) and the last one  thought that the fifth element had vanished forever. So you can imagine his reaction. Not only are some scenes funny but the dialogs are often zany. These comical elements enable to overlook the dramatic side of the situation. On another hand, Besson controls perfectly his movie: almost all the scenes (especially the action scenes) are meticulously well-ordered at the level of the making, the light, the costumes etc... So the movie doesn't neglect any point. Moreover,  Besson's making is inventive, clever ( besides the movie won an Oscar in France in 1998 for the best director). The screenplay is remarkably well put together and is boosting the spectator's attention by the apparition of new facts in common with the plot, even if it's a little manichean. The film is a pleasant surprise thanks to its actors too. Bruce Willis is simple, just, he doesn't ham it up and doesn't play the he-man. Gary Oldman is a wicked who never falls into the caricature; he's even fanciful and ridiculous. Let's add that the other actors are all excellent. At last , a sustained rythm not spoiled by the special effects, some extraordinaries sceneries; it seems that everything in this movie (which looks like a comic strip), was designed to charm the spectator. So it's not surprising that it was enormously successful in France.A remark: here, the president's got a neutral role unlike \"Independance day\" in which the president pilots a fighter plane.",

            "content": "The Fifth Element is a very creative and colorful movie with lots of in-your-face humor, flashy special effects and goofy, outrageous performances. It is a real sci-fi ride to enjoy, but perhaps not for everyone. When I first saw it, I made a point to check out all Luc Besson movies in the future because his unique style really impressed me. Unfortunately, it appears that The Fifth Element was not very representative of his directing style at all and more of a \"one time thing\".I'm having trouble recalling the plot of the movie as well as the manner in which it unfolded because The Fifth Element is a beautiful mess of people, aliens and events. It's set in the future. It's something about Bruce Willis (very John McClane-like) as a jaded cab driver and Milla Jovovich as the ultimate element of good versus invading alien forces of evil threatening to destroy the earth. That is one absurd plot outline, but it works well in the film and it is miles more complex if you want it to be. The reason it is so \"out there\" is because Luc Besson devised it as a teenager. If that doesn't promise an awesome movie, nothing does.Ian Holm, Gary Oldman (with a brand-new accent fit for the part, of course), Luke Perry and Chris Tucker all have parts in this film and both Holm and Oldman are excellent as ever. Many people found Tucker's over-the-top performance as an effeminate gay radio personality unbearably annoying, and I see where they are coming from. What I love about Milla Jovovich is that she doesn't seem to care what people think about her, but continues to take on ridiculous roles in even more ridiculous films (Ultraviolent, Resident Evil). In The Fifth Element, she certainly plays a colourful character but she does it very well because it calls for over-acting.To summarize, The Fifth Element is mostly goofy and fun. But sometimes\u0097in the midst of all action\u0097it actually manages to be very touching and beautiful. The sci-fi elements are extremely well-handled by Luc Besson and unusually imaginative for its genre. I highly recommend this film.",

            "content": "Written, both screenplay and original literary work, and directed solely by Luc Besson, this movie (to me) is the epitome of his artistic genius.The storyline/plot being one of the most creative pieces of work in the sci-fi genre, is as follows:There have been many battles between those Beings who first populated our planet and their ancient enemy, the Dark Lord. Throughout the centuries, every 1000 years, the Fifth Element is reborn (Much like the Living Buddah of the religious system known as Buddaism) in time to go up against the Dark Lord and his minions, the Mangalore. Only every thousand years, can he attack the planet Earth, in his attempt to conquer the universe.Along with the dynamics of the storyline, there are some twists which have to be figured out, which makes the movie even more interesting and enjoyable in this almost Egyptian-styled science fiction action/comedy.The effects are good, though some of them are a bit hokey, such as the guy's \"mirror hat\" in the first scene with Bruce Willis's character. On the whole, Joe and Yvonne Hobbs (wardrobe master/mistress) should be shot for the costumes they came up with in this movie. They are completely deplorable. There is NO sense of style, nothing even remotely believable was used, and the war gear belonging to the Mangalore warriors was flimsy as all h*ll and appeared to have come from a child's toy packet available at your local flea market for $4.99 + tax.Other than the costuming/wardrobing; however, this movie is one of the best in its class. The lines were well-delivered, the storyline flows nicely, with little or no stops, and the action and creatively crafted technological advances are quite thought-provoking, as well as highly entertaining.The stars of this movie are Bruce Willis as Major Korben Dallas, Gary Oldman as Jean-Baptiste Emanuel Zorg, Ian Holm as Priest Vito Cornelius, Milla Jovovich as Leeloo, Chris Tucker as DJ Ruby Rhod, the most colorful and inventive character of the movie. Without ruby Rhod, there would BE no \"Fifth Element,\" the movie. His character is the most entertaining, brilliant and totally hilarious of the entire list of personalities in this production.Bruce Willis just shines as Korben Dallas. His character is very well developed, well portrayed and carries that classic Bruce Willis style we've come to love. His character is smiling, sweet, caring and sensitive, yet tough and rough and ready for action at any moment. Brilliant portrayal by Willis.Gary Oldman; however, stank UP the place. Sorry, but his performance as Zorg was about as believable as Miss Piggy as a lead newscaster on CNN. \"He's about dumb,\" my cousin-in-law. \"Squiggy could've done a better job.\"Ian Holm is convincing and genuine in his portrayal as Priest Vito Cornelius, the priest who was trained for his whole life, for the moment when the Fifth Element would walk through his door. But what else would you expect from Ian Holm?Even Vladimir McCrary shines in his brief but poignant role as the \"human\" Aknot, the Mangalore leader.The wonders of fantasy instilled by Besson are genius: the flying Far Eastern restaurant, the ancient race of bardic Divas personified here by Diva Plavalaguna (portrayed convincingly and with sheer talent, style and grace by Besson's lover Ma\u00efwenn Le Besco) and so many other fantastical treats to grace the visual need for \"Eye Candy.\"This movie gives you depth, fantasy, and science fiction at its best; love and action, action, action.Enters: Ruby Rhod, in a live broadcast throughout the universe. He's an overdressed, flamboyant bi-sexual drag queen with a wonderfully phallic hairstyle. His wonderful sense of humor and the sexuality of the character he portrays comes through loud and clear in what is possibly the best acting of Chris Tucker's career. And his screams of fright will send you into spasmodic fits of laughter.The starship jockeys smoke ganja as they change the plutonium cores of the ships; torching the fuzzy, somewhat (Star Trek's) tribble-esquire space parasites from the ships' underbellies; and rocking to a nice soft island beat. A nice addition which occurs just before the first explosion of the movie, taking you fully by surprise.This movie has a very good feeling about it, even though it was written by Besson when he was quite young. I've understood he was a teenager when he first wrote this story, but it got revamped when he directed it as an adult.If you liked \"Stargate,\" the \"Lethal Weapon\" (for the action/comedy combination) series of movies, or \"Total Recall,\" you will like the \"Fifth Element.\"I absolutely loved this movie. The fight scene during the Diva's performance personifies Besson's genius. The choreography and execution of these two combined scenes is simply magnificent. In watching the movie again, for this review, I will say that this scene is moving in some way I can't explain. It's in a good way, but I can't explain how or why.That scene is the climax of the movie, and in my opinion, it totally redeems anything else you don't like such as the wardrobe of the characters. After this scene, the movie rock and rolls to a very satisfying end.As an afternote, I would like to add that I highly recommend the High Definition digitally remastered Ultimate Edition which contains over 120 minutes of documentaries, featurettes, plus a feature-length trivia fact track, and more. It's well worth the money and the bother of replacing your old copy.It gets a 9.1/10 from...the Fiend :.",

The poor woman trying to play the diva was utterly ridiculous in her attempt to look like she was producing the exquisite tones coming out of her mouth. In addition, for all the hype about the diva, it was only a letdown when the makeup and costuming effects were so-so and her phenomenal voice was augmented, not by incredible and imaginative visuals, but by silly hand movements and very un-diva-like she-bopping.The sets were eye-poppingly real and then suddenly cartoonish. Big ideas walked right alongside trite ones, constantly bringing the picture down. Entirely too much time was spent on the opening sequence, and other pacing issues bog the film down.

It is an annoying exercise in mediocre special effects , dumbed down story lines , and characters that are so one - dimensional and annoying that they are almost intolerable , aka Chris Tucker. Just what the hell was his character supposed to be doing anyway? As an inter - planetary DJ , he narrates nearly half the movie , and it's basically AWFUL. Milla Jovovich is an alien who can't speak English , and tries to communicate in cute foreign - speak throughout the movie , but is just annoying as well. And Bruce Willis as the world - weary cab driver is doing his macho thing as well as he usually does it , but I found this movie exhausting , stupid , amateurish , and just plain dopey.",

Even The Phantom Menace has more plot and credibility than this.Europeans like to criticize Americans movies, but when a French director comes up with his version of a Hollywood sci-fi movie, it accomplishes absolutely nothing.It can't be categorized as sci-fi, since the science is as good as a Duck Dodger cartoon, and there lies another problem, since The Fifth Element tries to be funny like the cartoon, but it is not even remotely that. It is not romantic, because Jovovich and Willis involvement is as shallow as it can be.Bruce Willis' character does not have a fraction of the charisma and wit that Han Solo had. Chris Tucker is supposed to be the comic relief but I was hoping for one of the aliens to shoot him up so the torture would end. The Divine Creature was actually a bit funny for being so badly written and an emotionally retarded character. It is a pity to see Gary Oldman being wasted in this movie.At halfway point, I was only hoping for the end, but unfortunately Luc Besson will never reimburse my money and I forever lost the time I wasted at the movie theater.",

            "content": "Good old popcorn movies. They never go out of style! They're the perfect remedy to pop on after a long week at work or on a boring rainy afternoon. Something to sit back, relax and enjoy. And director Luc Besson's 1997 sci-fi action/comedy epic \"The Fifth Element\" may just be one of the all-time greats! A film that is endlessly inventive and entertaining from the first frame to the last.In the distant future of 2263, a dark and mysterious force emerges that threatens to destroy all life as we know it. And the only thing that can stop it is an ancient weapon that combines the elements of fire, wind, water and earth with a living being- a \"fifth element\"- to channel them. And that fifth element? A peculiar and beautiful alien clone called \"Leeloo\" (Milla Jovovich), who must team up with a special-forces-agent-turned-cab-driver (Bruce Willis), a sagely monk (Ian Holm) and a fast-talking talk-show host (Christ Tucker) to save the universe!It's hard to believe that \"The Fifth Element\" will soon be going on twenty-five years old. Because for all intents and purpose... it's as refreshing and fun as it ever has been. The film benefits from a wonderful cast, a great tone and a deliciously over-the-top style that sets it apart from others that came both before and after.While Bruce Willis is definitely the headliner in the cast, there isn't enough that can be said about how wonderful Milla Jovovich is in the part of Leeloo. She is the beating heart of the film. She is fearless and charming, and can also kick some serious butt when needed. This is the film that made her a star, and she's just fabulous. Not that it takes anything away from the rest of the cast, though. Because they're just as good. Willis is a blast as usual, with his smart-alec nature and penchant for action, and he lends a lot to the proceedings. Holm brings a sense of class and dignity, and even gets some sharp comedic moments to sink his teeth into. And I know he's divisive in this film... but I friggin' love Chris Tucker as the obnoxious and hilarious Ruby Rhod. He's just a ton of fun. Special props also go to the always-reliable Gary Oldman as Zorg, one of the film's main villains. He's great in the part and brings a lot of life to the proceedings.I also really love the tone Besson establishes in the film. There's a lot of big, archetypal ideas at play, and in lesser hands, it could have turned out much more dour. But Besson wisely injects the film with some wonderful humor and a light, breezy quality. In a way, I would almost favorably compare it to a cartoon. Albeit, a cartoon for grown-ups. It never takes itself too seriously, and has a massive fun-factor. It's just such a joy to watch this movie.And then there's the style. And that's where the film really turns itself up to eleven! This is such a strange and unique film. There are so many wonderful details, eye-popping designs, wild costumes... you haven't seen anything quite like it! It's bold and vibrant and wondrous. Even sexy at times. This film is widely known for its insane visuals, and it's for a good reason. From the strange and otherworldly aliens to the hilariously revealing clothing to the vibrant pastel colors... Besson and his design team bring their A-game to the visuals. It's stunning.The only place where the film sometimes falters is in the pacing. The movie moves quite fast, and as a result, you do get the odd bit of tonal whiplash. Silly scenes don't always flow well into the more serious plot-driven moments. But I'd be lying if I said that this was a major problem. It's just a minor flaw in an otherwise excellent package.\"The Fifth Element\" is one of the definitive popcorn movies. It's loud. It's vibrant. And it's a ton of fun! This is not only one of best popcorn flicks of the 90's. It's one of the best popcorn flicks ever made. Period. It's hard to be objective in a case such as this, but there's no other way around it. I gotta give \"The Fifth Element\" a 10. Is it a perfect film? No. But it is perfect fun? Yes. Most certainly, yes.",

Chris Tucker's character is stupid, annoying, absurd, and unnecessary in this movie, his screaming all the time still building on the absurdity.  After Luc Besson's 'The Professional', which is a great film, and after seeing the 'Die Hard Trilogy', which are some of the best movies around, I had high expectations because of the clashing of Bruce Willis and Luc Besson.

The aliens in the film (The Mondoshawans, Mangalores and Diva Plavalaguna) are brilliantly realised and the action scenes such as the flying car chase and the all-out gun battle in the space hotel are staged brilliantly.I will never get tired of this movie. Be warned however that there is one blot on the landscape. THat blot's name is Chris Tucker. Don't get me wrong, I have seen both the RUSH HOUR movies and I thought he was very good in them, but here he is just annoying and obnoxious.

A secret priesthood is present on earth in order to keep the secret of an alien race with the only weapon, the fifth element, able to destroy this evil. When this evil appears, the aliens send a ship delivering the weapon. However the ship is ambushed by someone who clearly is not on the side of goodness. Only one being, Leeloo we learn later, (Jovovich) survives the ambush and unfortunately dramatically escapes from the authorities. She lands in Korben Dallas (Willis) cab and pleads for help. Soon Dallas finds himself involved in this mess with everyones survival on the edge. Good for us he is a retired commando.This movie is supergreen! It is completely spectacular and has it all. It has everything. Great special effects, good casting, nice acting (especially from Oldman and Rock), great directing, terrific music and splendid choreography, not to mention great story, humor, one-liners and Chris Rock screaming like a girl.The story is told in a lot of point of views, enabling the director to cut from different persons to tell the story. A possibility Besson uses frequently in this movie, with great skill. This makes the movie fast paced and full with humor. Willis and Jovovich is in the lead roles with Holm in a good performance as priest Cornelius. But the great acting is from Chris Rock, who makes a great radio-star/super-diva, and Gary Oldman, who is one of the best bad-guys ever. The special effects is great with the modern city, the hunt in the cab and a lot of alien views. But the best scene, one of my favorite scenes of all time, is the combined scene with the Divas performance and Leeloo's fight. A masterpiece.If you enjoy some action with little regard to plausibility, sit back and enjoy. Supergreen!10/10",

            "review_title": "The smell of polymethylethylchlorosomething",
            "content": "SPOILERS (as if anyone with a shred of sanity would care)I remember, being a child of the New Age of Plastic, getting shiny plastic toys for Christmas. Boiling with excitement, I tore off the paper, pulled open the box, yanked out the shrink-wrapped contents, and attempted to retrieve the toy, the actually goodie, from layer after layer of thick clear plastic. Invariably my mother had to retrieve her heavy metal sewing shears to cut through the nearly-impenetrable stuff. The combined smell of all of this, both toy and packaging, was almost insufferable: that dense, noxious smell of plastic and complex chemicals, compounds of benzene and styrene and polymethylchloryl-something-or-other, things that you just knew by instinct had never existed until just a few years previous, when clever scientists in lab coats had finally figured out how to dredge up the muck of countless long-dead creatures that had stored up energy from the sun when it burned a billion years ago, and coax and tease that muck into weird new chemical syntheses that will without doubt long outlive us all, buried in the bottom of a reeking landfill.But I was happy. I had my brightly-colored, plastic-smelling toy. It looked phony, it felt phony, it smelled phony, and if you burned it, it even burned phony, somehow, big glowing globs of plastic dripping like hellish candlewax. I soon tired of it, tired of the phoniness, and most of all the smell...but there would always be a new shiny plastic toy to catch my eye.It's that empty, shiny phoniness, that noxious smell that you hate subconsciously, but that reminds you of new toys, so you tell yourself you love it, that I get out of \"The Fifth Element.\" It is not the first movie that has reminded me of that plastic smell; in fact, I once thought that no movie would ever unseat \"Total Recall\" as the champion of the Plastic-Smelling Movie. I was wrong. I was wrong on a colossally huge scale.Everything about this movie, and brother, I do mean everything, is completely fabricated and plasticized. The harsh lighting, the ugly, garish costumes, the Looney Toons color scheme, the overwrought sets, the bright red hair, the deep blue skin, the rubbery-looking bad guy aliens, the whiney pseudo-Jewish mother on the cellphone, the meandering, pointless plot. Throw in double-takes, cartoon sound effects, goofy slow-mo, and a futuristic villain with a Southern drawl, and you have a movie that not only fails to capture your imagination and interest, but acts as a kind of reverse magnet for both. Try as you might, this movie locks imagination and interest right out with a big steel padlock.And yet I take my big metal sewing shears to this movie and try to cut off all of the senseless clear plastic wrapping to get at the brightly-colored, synthetic-smelling toy inside. Why? I don't think I can answer that question. I'm old; I know better. There is no rational explanation.So I'll leave it aside and move on to other topics. Example: This movie rips off lots of other movies. The similarities to \"Total Recall\" are too numerous and obvious to list. And then there are the echoes, however clumsily handled, of \"Blade Runner.\" (Although this megalopolis of the future is sunny and almost appealing, instead of dark, rainy and gritty.) Even \"Star Wars\"--those rubbery aliens, as a single example.The movie's attempts at humor are so ham-handed that they're laughable...or rather, beyond laughable. Insulting, really. The most extreme example of this is Chris Tucker's role, which is part superstud celebrity, part drag queen, part Buckwheat, and part PeeWee Herman. You have to admire the sheer chutzpah of the role, I suppose, even though it fails to work right from the start. But a failure like this is so cataclysmic that it's bound to evoke at least some pity. If a toy balloon pops at a party and a toddler sheds a few tears, we manage only a gentle smile. When the Hindenburg goes up in flames, we gnash our teeth and lament, \"Oh, the humanity!\" That's what this role is: It's the bleeping Hindenburg, only it's loaded with nuclear bombs instead of mere explosive hydrogen. Tucker has no choice but to keep rolling with this disaster, growing shriller and wider-eyed with every scene. Imagine being trapped in a role like that; you know it's not working; the cast and crew know it's not working; everyone knows it's not working. But what can you do? The hook is sunk, the barb has caught your flesh, so you put on your pushy-up bra and your fake-rose-festooned gown and crawl around on the floor on all fours, dodging rubbery-alien bullets and screaming like a little girl. Oh the humanity!Willis nearly disappears in this movie, even though he's the protagonist. It's just Willis being Willis. That same I'm-so-1940's-film-noir-hardboiled look he brings to practically every role. That same nonchalant way he lights a cigarette, or talks on the phone, or rolls his eyes. Willis shrinks to a vanishing point in this movie; they should have made his character a robot. An invisible robot.About two-thirds of the movie, there's a scene where a hotel-in-space is about to explode, and panicked guests rush to little space lifeboats, which stream away from the hotel by the hundreds. Alas, we are not so lucky, because even though the number one humanoid bad guy has been atomized, and the fabled \"stones\" recovered, there is still a big fireball hovering outside Earth, for some stupid reason, so we must soldier on. The attempt to build tension for the climax is ridiculous, with the rescue from death of the entire planet delayed until the very...last...second, and it's achieved by the silly red-haired chick's performing a kind of cosmic laser yawn. Oh, and by love. Stapled on at the last second because the red-haired chick was looking at a montage of pictures about war, for some inexplicable reason, and apparently she had never realized until that moment that the world is filled with ugliness. Even though everything IN THIS ENTIRE MOVIE up to that point has been UGLY. I mean geez, was she in a coma or something? Is this the same chick who personally kicked the asses of about 50 of those really ugly, violent rubbery aliens? (In a scene, incidentally, that is pure Three Stooges--except it isn't funny.) And then had to flee an exploding space hotel? Did she think that was a kid's birthday party or something? Anyway, these pictures convince her that there was no point in living, not for her or anyone else, and it takes Sweet Baby Bruce the Lovin' Hunk to convince her that she should do the laser yawn thing about 15 milliseconds before the Earth is atomized. Bruce: You might want to put parental controls on your collection of genocide pictures. Safety first!Oh, before I forget: those rubbery aliens have machine guns whose bullets can't penetrate even the flimsiest of furniture. They fire off about 50,000 rounds at Willis while he's hiding under a table whose top looks paper thin, and we see the table shredded to bits, but our hero emerges unscathed. Steven Segal would have been proud. In fact, about the only thing this movie lacks is a patented flabby kung fu scene by Segal where he moves with all the speed of a tree sloth and yet fends off 25 attacking super-ninjas. If I were making a \"special edition\" of this movie, I'd splice in one of those scenes right in the middle of this movie. I bet you no one would even notice.Then we cut to the final scene, which is another pointless ripoff (the director no doubt thought of it as an homage), to the Bond movies this time, where the hero beds the chick while the VIP's stand around and wait to congratulate him. Bruce and the red haired chick are in what appears to be an iron lung. Again, why? Maybe they mentioned a reason, but you're beyond paying attention to the movie at this point, so you just shrug your shoulders and say, \"Because that's what they came up with to rip off the Bond-in-a-space-capsule-in-the-sea schtick.\" And the very last second of the movie is...I swear I'm not making this up...a freeze-frame. What the heck? Is this 1973 or something?Please please please do not watch this movie. I couldn't bear it. Do you hear me? I couldn't bear it. No! Put it down. No! No! I'm begging....Fine. Just for that, I'm watching \"Neighbors\" again. No, don't start complaining now. I'm going to watch it, and I'm going to ENJOY it, and make you suffer. You started this.And I'm going to finish it.",

Only the fifth element (played by Milla Jovovich) can stop the Evil from extinguishing life, as it tries to do every five thousand years. She is helped by ex-soldier, current-cab-driver, Corben Dallas (played by Bruce Willis), who is, in turn, helped by Prince/Arsenio clone, Ruby Rohd. Unfortunately, Evil is being assisted by Mr. Zorg (Gary Oldman), who seeks to profit from the chaos that Evil will bring, and his alien Mercenaries. The Fifth Element should be seen by all sci-fi film enthusiasts. It is absolutely loaded with an incredible jumble of eye candy. One amazing spectacle after another leaps onto the screen to thrill us. It is laced with very rich imagery, and demands repeated viewing to take in all the details thanks to great direction by French director Luc Besson. The story is a disaster and I had to watch this film 2 times to appreciate it, and now I love it.

            "content": "After seeing this movie for the second time on video I have concluded that Luc Besson is a brilliant filmmaker. In regards to story and effects this movie has nothing new. The story is basically about saving the world and the effects are standard for a science fiction movie these days. Other than a comment on war, which ends with okay we fight but we also love, this movie does not raise any issues. In fact that comment is really stupid because its like saying, \"okay, I did kill somebody but that's okay because I helped an old lady cross the road.\" Stupid I reckon. What made this movie unique were numerous little oddities that set it apart from the standard Hollywood movie.The Fifth Element is a Hollywood movie, the line about war is a clear indication of the Americanism of it. The movie also uses American actors, such as Bruce Willis and Gary Oldman, but all of the production crew are French, especially Luc Besson, the director and writer of the movie. As such there seems to be lots of oddities that come across, though I would not label that as being strictly French considering Les Visiteurs is a purely French film, yet it appears to be something from Hollywood (not that it is a bad movie), thus I put down all of the oddities in the Fifth Element to Luc Besson's style, which is something I enjoy tremendously.The characters are very non-standard. Corbin Dallas (Bruce Willis) is probably the only stereotypical character in the movie, though he has his own little quirks as well. It is the minor characters that really stick in my mind. Luke Perry plays a young assistant to an Egyptologist who counts the number of times the Egyptologist cries out \"Aziz Light!\". Characters' reactions to the famous personalities are very memorable. The timidness really stands out. It is not a slight stammering but a really noticeable unease. The radio announcer is really weird, being a lover caught in the middle of a violent gun battle and commentating on it, and Zorg (Gary Oldman) the \"bad guy\" (though he is not really because the Shadow is the bad guy, Zorg is just one of his agents), is an incredibly memorable bad guy just by his unique characteristics. It is also noticeable that the hero, Corbin Dallas, and Zorg never actually meet.The movie is also very colourful, and much imagination has gone into the uniforms. The future has a very urban feel to it, yet the colour makes it really interesting. The colours are very stark, making it seem more like a comic book movie. The Fifth Element is a very good movie, well worth seeing just for the uniqueness of it.",

But when I decided to write these reviews, I vowed I would watch each movie start to finish to give it a fair shake. Well, shake time has come and I'm not getting it.Now I like a good sci-fi flick as well as the next person. But casual references to \"Star Wars\" isn't going to put this in the same league by any stretch. Not even if the whole picture looks like it was filmed at the Mos Eisley Cantina under new management. The closest parallel to \"Star Wars\" was Diva Plavalaguna, looking like a cross between an Alien and Bib Fortuna. Now \"Aliens\", that was another great sci-fi story.I'll give the picture credit for one creative bit - whoever came up with Gemini Croquet was brilliant - a clever riff of Jiminy Cricket. As in \"Yesterday's frog will be tomorrow's prince\", an actual quote from the film.So you have four stones representing the natural Earth elements at the center of the ultimate battle between good and evil. Presumably Leeloo (Milla Jovovich) was the title character and missing fifth element necessary to save the planet. I have to ask myself if Bruce Willis was the one single actor bold enough to portray Korben Dallas, because to get mixed up with this production, you needed a pretty big set of stones yourself.",

            "content": "For someone who doesn't normally like science fiction movies, it's pretty funny that one of the movies I was raised on was The Fifth Element. This was such a beloved movie in our household, we frequently quoted one-liners and even named one of our cats after Milla Jovovich's character. Because we couldn't resist the little kitten, even though we hadn't intended to come home with one, and because she had a bit of orange poking through her Abyssinian fur, we thought she was \"the supreme being\". The Fifth Element might not be your favorite action flick, but I'm sure you understand that it's one of mine.In a hilarious, wacky future with flying cars, robot bartenders, clunky guns, and devices that change one's nail polish instantly, Bruce Willis stars as a scruffy, recently fired cab driver who gets drawn into a mission to save the world. On accident, a beautiful, scantily-clad woman falls into his cab, and he helps her escape from the bad guys chasing her. She speaks no English and has no identification, but Bruce quickly learns that Milla is \"the supreme being\" destined to save the world. She's so adorable! As he helps her learn English and information about the modern world, they also fall in love. Ian Holm and Chris Tucker join the \"save the world gang\", playing a by-the-rules religious figure and an over-the-top gameshow host, respectively. The head bad guy, who's far more hilarious than evil, is Gary Oldman. Every scene of his is memorable, with delightful humor and a quotable line to take with you after the credits roll. Then again, the same can be said for everyone else's scenes; it's just that type of a movie.Much like the plot to save the world, everyone in the cast presents his or her own element, combining to create perfection. If you've never seen this movie, give it a chance. You might not name your cat after it, but you'll certainly be entertained and come away with some new household phrases. \"I don't want an incident!\" \"Mul-ti-pass.\" \"Think he's gonna be okay?\" \"Do-you-want-some-more?\" \"Aziz, lights!\" \"If you want something done, do it yourself!\" If those quotes don't bring a smile to your face, you've either never seen the movie or haven't seen it in a long time.

However, the star, for me, is Ian Holm who is a wonderful and dependable spine going through the whole film. He's mix of bewilderment and being thrilled is tremendous.

I guess I haven't seen enough French cinema. Bruce Willis plays your typical reluctant protagonist and it fits him well. Milla Jovivich plays Leeloo, an alien tasked with protecting the world, who can kick a** when she needs too, but is not invincible. Milla does a great job with the character and gives her so much life, creating many memorable moments. Gary Oldman is also entertaining as the industrialist, Zorg, who has his own part to play in the story. Supporting cast all around does a decent job, although, Chris Tucker as Ruby Rhod may be bit too much for some people. All in all, this is a great movie that is highly rewatchable and one that shouldn't be slept on. Final verdict: 8/10.",

I first saw The Fifth Element on VHS back in the early 2000s and sufficed to say I didn't enjoy it all that much. I recently decided to give the movie a second chance to see if my opinion on it has changed after nearly twenty years.The story follows retired ex military soldier Korben Dallas (Bruce Willis) who drives a hover cab in a futuristic New York City. Korben is on the verge of losing his licence due to too many accidents driving his cab when one day a half naked woman crashes through his cab roof and his life is changed forever. The woman just happens to be the most important person in the galaxy. The woman named Leeloo (Milla Jovovich) is on a mission to collect four ancients stones imbued with the power of the four elements Earth, Wind, Fire, and Water. The stones power when combined with a fifth element will create a weapon of pure light which is the only thing that can stop an ancient evil known as the Dark from destroying the world. Korben and Leeloo pursue the stones separately and together but find themselves up against a rather eccentric evil villain named Mr Zorg (Gary Oldman) aswell a group of war hungry aliens hell bent on causing destruction. Time is running out to find the stones and unite them with the unknown fifth element to save the world from complete destruction.I honestly had trouble writing that brief plot summary due to how bizarre this film is. The film starts out like it's going to be a serious science fiction film with a story about quirky characters trying to save the world from destruction. However the film quickly turns into a science fiction comedy by adding silly idiotic humour and some of the most annoying characters you can imagine. I completely lost interest in the films story at the half way point when Chris Tuckers \"Comic Relief\" character entered the film and all I wanted to do was tear my ears off.There's plenty of action in the movie however most it takes place during the last thirty minutes of the movie and is mostly spoiled by Chris Tuckers constant screaming like a woman in a high pitched tone. Bruce Willis gives a decent performance as usual. All Mila Jovovich does in the film is get naked and says the words \"Multi Pass\" about ten times. Gary Oldman seemed like the only actor having any real fun in this movie playing the movies overly eccentric and crazy main villain to perfection.I can definitely see why so many people enjoy this film and I appreciate the fun and entertaining energy writer, director Luc Besson was going for with the film. However I personally didn't enjoy the movies attempt at humour which to me felt like something I would have maybe found funny during my youth but as adult just find cringe worthy. Actor Ian Holm who played the psychotic android Ash in Alien also Co Stars in the film. There are also a couple of interesting cameos throughout the film. Actor Mac Mcdonald who played Captain Hollister on the British cult hit science fiction TV show Red Dwarf makes a brief cameo in the film as an overweight police officer. There's also a surprising cameo by famous British actor/stand up comedian Lee Evans who plays a bumbling spaceship sailer.I recommend The Fifth Element if you enjoy quirky and unique science fiction movies that mix comedy with science fiction storytelling. However if you prefer something more serious and entertaining like Star Trek TNG then maybe give this film a miss.",

Taking elements from the iconic comic book series \"The Incal\", by Alejandro Jodorowsky & Jean Giraud (Moebius), and \"The Circles of Power\", by Pierre Christin & Jean-Claude Mezieres. For whatever reason I find this movie to be extremely underrated. The performances, effects, and various species just make me wish more people would talk about it nowadays.Set in the twenty-third century. The story involves the survival of Earth, which becomes the responsibility of Korben Dallas (Bruce Willis), a taxicab driver and former special forces major. After a young woman (Milla Jovovich) falls into his cab, Dallas joins forces with her to recover four mystical stones essential for the defence of Earth against the impending attack.Bruce Willis is our lead. Playing the usual tough guy persona is nothing unfamiliar, but I think this character is a lot more well developed than the usual one off film he does here and there. Milla Jovovich is wonderfully quirky as the naive Leeloo, who trained vigorously for her role as well as developing a fictional language of 400 words with the director. Finally, Gary Oldman shines again as the corrupt businessman Zorg, fresh from the eccentrics of Besson's \"Leon: The Professional\" (1994). The likes of Ian Holm, Chris Tucker, Luke Perry and comedian Lee Evans build a wonderful supporting cast.To best describe it's sprawling futuristic city visuals of flying cars and eccentric uniforms, it's essentially \"Blade Runner\" (1982), set in the daylight. The way this city breaths is like a dance of sorts with great pacing, a fantastic soundtrack and energy that compliments this outlandish movie so well. You'll believe almost anything that is thrown at you and take it as the norm. Being that it was the costliest European film at the time of it's release, it seemed to divide people's opinions straight down the middle.Final Verdict: Luc Besson literally created an amazingly French science fiction movie, that captures the \"Bande Dessin\u00e9e\" vibes and adapts them to a tee. It's my sci-fi equivalent to \"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\" (1971). 9/10.",

I'll give Besson his due for having the right kind of general idea.  He wants to give us a guided tour of the rainbow, and he has a good deal of success, in individual scenes.  He knows that computers alone won't do the trick.  The perfect lighting combines with set and costume design to serve up some lovely colour-cocktails: president's purple throne room, the villain standing in a corridor of weed-tinted green, the blue soprano singing in front of a dark indigo arches framing a ripe blue planet.  But it doesn't always work.  Sometimes Besson's sense of colour fails him and the result is a mess.  And apart from his sense of colour he has nothing to fall back on.  The design of the future - it's all visual design - is mostly a compendium of clich\u00e9s, mixed in with a souped-up vision of the 1990s: an empty, hip, MTV flashiness.  Some of the computer images work, but most of them - the traffic shots in particular - feature the kind of cheesy rendering and animation that will forever be the industry standard, if we're not careful.Hipness - that's Besson's guiding star.  He doesn't even care what his film looks like so long as he can convince us that he's up-to-the-minute and with it.  I suppose that's why the action sequences are all underscored (and undercut) by ghastly techno-trash for which, as is so often the case, Eric Serra is to blame.Apart from the look and the feel there's nothing to talk about without being overcome by deep weariness.  The plot isn't hard to understand.  At least, it's as easy to understand on the first viewing as it's ever going to get. It will never make any sense.  Here's the central idea: once every five thousand years comes a great evil that will destroy all life, ALL life, if a magic ceremony isn't performed.  The villain wants to stop the ceremony from being performed.  The phrase \"obscure motivation\" doesn't even begin to describe this situation.  Does the villain want to die?  No.  Is he acting in ignorance?  No.  Is there ANY way of making sense of his psychology? No.If Besson had been content with a simple high-wire act of implausibility, if he'd been willing to let his central conceit rest unexplained, it MIGHT have worked.  But he tries to explain things and makes matters worse.  He can't even come up with some decent sophistry.  Watch the first confrontation between the priest and the villain while bearing in mind that both players know that the future of all life is at stake.  The advanced student who can salvage some kind of point from this scene should then turn his attention to the mysterious actions performed by the priest (a different priest) in the opening scene.  It's no use: there's no making sense of any of it.So far I've been kind.  It's despicable as well as bad.  Anything so soulless, that tries so hard to be hip and cynical, has no RIGHT to attempt such blatant emotional manipulation at the end.",

Luc Beeson has directed other films that are great (The Professional for example), but this is his best in my opinion. It has all of the best elements of an enjoyable film. Great characters played by great actors, a superbly funny sci-fi script, great set designs and special effects, and action that moves along briskly making the film seem almost too short. This is one of the few films that I have to watch whenever it's on TV. \"Multi-pass.\"\nFour ancient elements are hidden on earth to protect them. A fifth element is kept elsewhere to protect it separately from the other elements. Together they have the power to save the universe from Ultimate Evil which is heading to earth to get the 4 elements and annihilate the planet. Only one man, Corbin Geiss (Bruce Willis) can save the universe, and Zorg (Gary Oldman) is his nemesis trying to get the 4 elements for himself, on behalf of Ultimate Evil. Enjoy a really different sci-fi experience in this wildly creative movie! \ud83c\udf7f",

The storyline is set in the future when a taxi driver down on his luck happens to have a strange woman fall in his lap that doesn't speak English but obviously needs his help. He decides to take a chance that may ruin his career and direction but land him an adventure.This movie is directed by Luc Besson (Leon: The Professional) and stars Bruce Willis (Pulp Fiction), Milla Jovovich (Resident Evil), Gary Oldman (Bram Stokers Dracula), Chris Tucker (Friday), Ian Holm (Lord of the Rings), Tom Lister Jr. (Friday) and Luke Perry (90210).The settings, storyline, characters, costumes and special effects in this are so unique and science fiction gold. This movie could not have been better cast or written. The dialogue in this was awesome and I thoroughly enjoyed every character interaction. Willis was a perfect hero and Oldman was a great villain and both did a wonderful job of weaving humor into their performances. Chris Tucker's performance in this was legendary and he was hilarious.This is a movie where there is absolutely nothing they could have done better. This is an easy 10/10 and a science fiction masterpiece. I would strongly recommend this movie.",

And I thought Bruce Willis was the coolest action hero ever at that time. This is also the first film where I saw Milla Jovovich kicking ass and she does a fine job of it. I also remember there was a lot of marketing that went into this movie. And I remember my elementary school teachers carrying around cups from fast food restaurants advertising this film. And for what it is, I personally think that it still holds up today. It's imaginative and I liked the design of it all as corny as some of it is. It's like watching some of the sci-fi arts from Deviantart coming to life. For a movie such as this some aspects of it seemed like it is ahead of it's time. This is the movie that Luc Besson really got to showcase his directing style and the elements that he likes to bring to the table. It's like watching a really good live action movie based on a Japanese manga or anime. Overall, this isn't a sci-fi movie that should be taken seriously but to just enjoy the fun, creative and stylish ride. It's not a movie that takes on a dark and serious tone like \"Blade Runner\" after all. Instead it takes on a more witty and comedic approach with vibrant and stylish visuals but there is some meat to the story. Watching this again in 2017 was blast from the past.8.5/10",

            "content": "On the surface, this is a SF action film about former warriors-turned-taxi-drivers saving damsels in distress for a grand cause. Visually it is based on the famed graphic novels by Moebius and Jodorowsky. The plot is slave to a concatenation of unforgettable scenarios, from an alien blue opera singer shot to death at the height of her aria, to BADA-BOOM.But really, this movie tweaks modern culture, especially the \"culture am\u00e9ricaine\" with which the French (a species to which Director Luc Besson belongs) have such a love-hate relationship. The movie is full of 1000s (literally) auditory and visual cultural allusions. Some of them are hyped up to hysterical levels, like the annoying talk show host we all would like to kill (played to immense effect by Chris Tucker). Others are slightly more subtle (like cigarettes with filters longer than the tobacco part). Many require careful viewing (like some of the items in the collection of the flying Chinese lunch truck). One of the most loving and thorough set and prop designs I've ever seen in a film.I find that some people instinctively hate this movie. When cornered, they can't put their finger on the plot or acting (although neither is always pristine in this film), for there are many films with cartoon acting and deus ex machina plot devices that are not hated. Instead, I suspect they feel indignation at the fun that is being poked at the cultural memes they have accepted.This film is SF at its best: a satire that uses the distant future to examine our corporate politics, our pop culture, our high art, our food, and yes, our cigarette butts - now.",

This is the first review I write, as a public service to those who may be thinking about seeing it. Unless you really like flashy sci-fi films regardless of content, then avoid. Like the plague. To its credit, Luc Besson has done a spectacular job with the effects and costume. At the start, at Bruce Willis' apartment, there were some good Blade Runner-ish moments, but they are really wasted on this film. Oh, and the ending is really tacky. The film lacks any kind of plot direction, half the time I was wondering what the whole point was. Ian Holm tries his best to do Cadfael, but doesn't really convince. Bruce Willis puts a good effort in too however this is not to be his finest hour. In the end I just found the storyline to be tacky and irritating. The costumes just got more and more bizarre (golden ducks and a blue lycra male diva anyone?). Luc Besson has done far better films (Nikita, Leon) and you should see these instead - he must have been on some weird trip to concoct this.",

Something not to be surprised of by a a director (the most successful director) of the \"Cinema du look\" movement.The plot is paperthin but the images are terrific. The visual language looks very much like a comic book (\"Kuifje\" or \"TinTin), and I later read that this is indeed one of the sources of inspiration for director Luc Besson. The, often very strange, costumes were designed by the famous French couturier Jean Paul Gaultier. This was not the first time that this fashion designer contributed to a movie. Earlier examples are \"The cook, the thief, his wife & her lover\" (1989, Peter Greenaway) and \"The city of lost children\" (1995, Jean Pierre Jeunet).The film has hints of classic science fiction films such as \"Metropolis\" (1927, Fritz Lang) and \"Blade runner\" (1982, Ridley Scott), but takes itself less seriously. There are comic characters that in my opinion are a little silly (certainly after a while). Brilliant are the visual gags such as McDonalds and the Chinese take-away in the 23th century.According to Rogert Ebert the film is a bit to long, and I agree with him. To avoid this is in principle the job of the editor. One can imagine however the objections of director Besson when she cuts away very expensive scenes.",

            "content": "While this film isn't a master piece it is very entertaining it never takes itself too seriously nor goes it go in for lame jokes or slap stick, the humour comes from the characters and the situations they find themselves in. There is a degree of campness but what would you expect in a film where Jean-Paul Gaultier designed the costumes.In the prologue, set in 1914, we learn that there is a weapon which is used to protect the Earth from an evil which attacks every five thousand years, when its existence is discovered it is taken away by an alien race for safe keeping, they promise that it will be returned when it is needed. The rest of the film takes place three hundred years later when the evil returns. As promised the aliens return the five elements that make up the weapon, unfortunately they are shot down en route and all that remains are a few cells from the fifth element; a perfect being. Luckily in the future these few cells are enough to recreate the being who turns out to be Leeloo, a red haired girl played by Milla Jovovich. She escapes from the lab and leaps from the skyscraper it is housed in; landing in a taxi driven by Korben Dallas (Bruce Willis). The other four elements, four stone objects, are still missing and are being sought be a priest (Ian Holm) and the evil Zorg (Gary Oldman). The stones are being delivered by another person who will hand them over on another planet in a luxury hotel in orbit. Korbin and Leeloo go there after winning a rigged competition where unfortunately for Korbin he has to hang around with radio personality Ruby Rhod (Chris Tucker) as part of his \"prize\".The film is very stylish and has plenty of action and funny moments, when I first watched it I wasn't impressed with Chris Tucker's character but on later viewing grew to find him quite funny. Gary Oldman was entertainingly over the top as the pantomime villain the other main characters were well played too. It is nice also to see non-CGI monsters that still look good.If you enjoy science fiction and want to watch some thing that isn't too serious this will is worth watching.",

            "content": "Luc Besson's \"The Fifth Element\" is a sci-fi movie that puts more emphasis on adventure than on scientific speculation. However, that doesn't mean that the movie isn't brimming with imaginative content. The world of \"The Fifth Element\" is colourful and well realized, while the plot is full of action.The somewhat convoluted storyline revolves around the search for the titular 'Fifth Element', which is mankind's only hope against impending doom. A colourful cast of characters are on the trail of this mystical item for various reasons. I'm keeping this synopsis vague mainly because the premise is one that's difficult to describe in just a few words.The movie attracted an interesting cast, to say the least. Bruce Willis, in prime 'working man's action hero' mode, was the top-billed star and he didn't disappoint. However, Milla Jovovich had probably the film's most memorable performance as perfect human being Leeloo. That's not to take anything away from the always intriguing Gary Oldman, whose outlandish portrayal of an arms dealer was something to behold. Also memorably outlandish was Chris Tucker as entertainment personality Ruby Rhod. I haven't even touched on Sir Ian Holm or notable appearances by the likes of Luke Perry, Mathieu Kassovitz & trip-hop pioneer Tricky. As I said, definitely an interesting cast.Visually, the movie is a treat. Luc Besson went for a style inspired by French comics artists Jean \"Moebius\" Giraud & Jean-Claude M\u00e9zi\u00e8res, even going so far as to hire them to contribute to the production design. The result was a vibrant, fully realized world of the future that isn't just a retread of tired genre tropes. Meanwhile, Besson's direction is nicely handled and keeps the action flowing smoothly.All in all, \"The Fifth Element\" is a memorable science fiction movie that managed to separate itself from the pack by presenting a unique vision. A varied and well-assembled cast helped to bring the movie to life, as did a fast-moving storyline that's full of twists and turns.",

And the director, Luc Besson, is a well-respected artist whose short-but-impressive resume includes such international hits as La Femme Nikita and The Professional (Leon). I figured that if anyone could handle the task of putting together a rousing science fiction adventure with Bruce Willis in the lead, it was Besson. I was not disappointed! For its time, visually great and some funny moments. Not intellectually challenging like Donnie Darko or Serenity so no 8. The story is fast paced, but without overdoing the action and indeed Bruce Willis is actually intelligent in this movie for a change! Fanatistic costumes, really wacky and futuristic.",

He must have finished it before he turned seventeen, because \"The Fifth Element\" is one of the most immature and annoying movies I can remember.  What story there is becomes mind-numbingly dull by the end, but before that point, Besson heaps so much half-witted, pseudo-intellectual garbage on the audience that it made me want to scream.  I've heard some people excuse the lack of any logic or reason in the plot by saying, \"Well, it's a sci-fi film, you know?!\"  My response is that the best science-fiction novels and films have their basis in physics, biology, etc... and are usually meticulously structured and well thought out.  Besson seems to have based \"The Fifth Element\" in his typical sophomoric tendency of making style tantamount to substance.  However, I will say that the acting of Milla Jovovich was quite strong and Bruce Willis wasn't bad either.  One last knock against the film: it unleashed the unbearable Chris Tucker on the world!!!",

Because everything indicates that this movie should have been a rather big box office hit, and while it did rather good overall when you factor in the whole world, here in the United States it kind of had a lackluster showing. Makes no sense as it seems to be liked by a good many people and it had Bruce Willis at his best and introduced two relative newcomers to the screen in Milla Jovavich and Chris Tucker (though I believe Tucker was in \"Friday\" before this one). It also had really good special effects, especially in the city. So good in fact I often feel George Lucas really liked those city scenes as he seemed to add a place just like it in his second Star Wars movie \"Attack of the Clones\". The plot is pretty good, though it gets to be a bit much in areas as there are multiple bad guys here and there for our hero to overcome including time as the longer things go on the more likely it is for the Earth to be destroyed. Yes, an ordinary cabbie gets to be a hero, though he is an ex-soldier, as a young and mysterious girl comes crashing through the roof of his flying cab. On with some nice chases and such and a trip to a cruise ship in space for a bizarre operatic fight scene. The movie has a bunch of stuff going on though like I said at times to much as poor Gary Oldman's character just does not get enough screen time and he factors almost not at all in the final showdown. Still, overall this movie is a fun watch even though there is a lot going on and the ending was a tad anti-climatic.",

The only \"survivor\" of this attack is a hand, which when reconstituted and recreated turns into the \"Perfect Being\", (later named) Leeloo (Milla Jovovich). She manages to escape though, landing in the taxi of ex-soldier Korben Dallas (Bruce Willis), who takes her to the current knowledgeable priest, Father Vito Cornelius (Sir Ian Holm). Meanwhile, wealthy industrialist Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg (Gary Oldman) is trying to get the Elements for himself to increase the Great Evil he has had communication with. Korben and Leeloo arrive at Fhloston Paradise as winners of a big contest, with wild radio presenter Ruby Rhod (Chris Tucker) to distract him, but Korben does have an idea of where the Elements are. They turn up in the stomach of the entrusted keeper, Diva Plavalaguna (Ma\u00efwenn Le Besco), and it is a race against time to return the four stones, and Leeloo as The Fifth Element, to the site where they were found. In the end, Zorg was killed by his own bomb, and the five elements are returned and opened by their symbols, earth, wind, fire, water, and love, and don't worry, Leeloo did live after the world was saved. Also starring Luke Perry as Billy, Brion James as General Munro, Tommy 'Tiny' Lister as President Lindberg and look out for Lee Evans as Fog. The performances, from robust action man Willis, marvellously villainous Oldman, attractive and feisty Jovovich and hilarious Carter are all great. The special effects for the big city backgrounds and alien creatures are very well done, and if this film doesn't get you hooked with the fantastic chases, action, comedy and satire, then I don't know what will. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Sound Effects Editing, and it won the BAFTA for Best Special Effects. Gary Oldman was number 40, and Bruce Willis number 35 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Oldman was also number 11 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, and he was number 36 on The World's Greatest Actor.

While watching the film, we will notice Milla Jovovich in a very early role as a career starter. Within we realize that she is what the title of the film represents. Meaning, she is the fifth element, she's the sum total of our hope for survival, but she's way down the cast list and she can't get around town without Bruce Willis. The Fifth Element is an entertaining and visually stunning sci-fi piece but at times the film somewhat drags on. Not as high on the film as it has been praised, it is mindless fun. What makes the film great is the presence of Milla Jovovich as Leeloo, as well as the portrayal of Bruce Willis' character. There is chemistry there and it shows as the film progresses.",

            "content": "The story goes that director Luc Besson began writing THE FIFTH ELEMENT in his teens, incorporating all the Sci-Fi elements he loved into one over-the-top, grand space opera...sort of an \"E.E. 'Doc' Smith 'Skylark' Meets Flash Gordon and Barbarella\" hybrid with sex, intergalactic action, and even some pseudo-religious overtones tossed in...in other words, a teenage daydream come true! Critics panned the end result for this very reason, sneering at Bruce Willis' Earth-saving (yet again!) Korben Dallas, and Besson's then-girlfriend, clothing-optional Milla Jovovich, as the innocent demigod, Leeloo.The critics were wrong!THE FIFTH ELEMENT is, in the best sense of the word, a classic 'B' movie, a space opera where a prologue vaguely similar to STARGATE leads to a future Earth where traffic jams occur thirty stories above the ground, humanity is ruled by beefy 'Tiny' Lister Jr., and where the Ultimate Evil is served by everyone's favorite villain, Gary Oldman, sporting a Southern accent! If this DOESN'T convince you that this is a 'popcorn' flick, not to be taken too seriously, there is Chris Tucker, sporting a blond hairdo, as the Galaxy's favorite media personality, promoting himself as he hits on his adoring female fans; Ian Holm, as the monk who knows 'the Secret', forced, despite himself, to become an active participant in the adventure; and some of the most butt-ugly alien mercenaries you'll ever see, terrorizing a space resort, until they meet their match in Bruce Willis' 'DIE HARD in Space' protagonist! Yippee-Ki-Yay, indeed!The FX are astonishing, the comedy, broad and sly, the heroics, macho, and as Leeloo, sent to save Earth, Jovovich manages to be both naive and sexy, with broken English and a gymnast's grace.Bruce Willis is a joy, as always, to watch, and he carries the film with charm and self-depreciating humor, whether dealing with endless phone calls from his mother, driving his sky taxi recklessly (cabbies change very little in the future!), taking on terrorists single-handed, or falling for the exotic Leeloo. When he blows away a roomful of hostage-holding aliens, then asks, \"Does anyone else want to negotiate?\", you KNOW Besson picked the right guy for the lead!If you want Profound Science Fiction, watch 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY again...but if you want to kick back and just have fun, look not further...THE FIFTH ELEMENT delivers!",

It has that feel of uniqueness to it, like it knows exactly what it's doing, even if it's completely random. And sure, it uses the technique of throwing every single weird and random thing at the screen and watching what will stick. But the thing is, most of it does stick. Everything from the weird weapon designs to clothing to random little details like a yard long list of weapon proficiencies to the whole mythos of the fifth element.It's also features some real acting talent in Bruce Willis and Gary Oldman, both hamming it up to eleven, Oldman especially, and having the time of their lives. Milla Jovovich as Leeloo is not in their league, truth be told, but she plays a delightful oddball with suitable skill to convince and intrigue.The rest you really need to go and experience yourself. It's a thrilling, never-stopping ride of adventures, science fiction gizmos, unhinged humour, cool visuals and special effects, bizarre characters and even more bizarre circumstances and so much more. One of the most enjoyable scifi films ever made and well worth it.",

            "content": "The Fifth Element (1997, Directed by Luc Besson), set in the 23rd century, is a Cyber-Punk film bursting with hilarity, technology, electrifying music and flying cars. It ridiculously screams sci-fi, so much that it can be mistaken for a spoof, of which it certainly is not. Besson, ever the eye for detail, creates the future in a fantastically zingy way that draws the audience in to its colourful world of fast paced mingleaninga.Korben Dallas (Bruce Willis) is former special agent, now taxi driver turned special agent again in order to save the world from an ever growing evil in the form of a giant burning evil 'scare the pants of The President' ball of fire. In order to save the world from this said evil he needs five elements, 4 of which are unknown to everybody except the fifth element who he predictably meets after she falls into his taxi after being chased by cops.Leeloo Minai Lekarariba Laminai Tchai Ekbat De Sebat, otherwise known as Leeloo, is the Fifth Element that predictably falls into Korben Dallas' taxi cab. She is not human, not robot, not anything really, although she is very much a human. She was built from strands of DNA to create what scientists called 'The Perfect Being', and she is really. She was built to 'Protect'. She is a likable character; her flaming orange hair accentuates her unique personality. She is the brainiest character, knows everything, and learns everything by just looking at pictures and text for just one split second, possibly due to the fact that she was made with a photographic memory.Ruby Rhod (Chris Tucker) is a squeaky voiced, over-dramatic confusing Radio DJ whose hair is really eccentric and unpredictable. He follows Korban around like a bad smell, and annoys the living daylights out of him. If it's not the plot of the film that keeps you entertained, it's Ruby. While he may seem annoying and you may think that you will hate him, I can assure you that you won't. There's just something about him that makes you want to see this film over and over again. In all the scenes he's in, he speaks in his own way, and will not shut up. Most of the time you can hear nothing but him blabbering on. He is a great character for a film like this.The film is largely dependant on its fast paced music to keep the audience enthralled, the punky pop music is extremely enjoyable and helps keep the film bouncing on its toes. In one electrifyingly gripping scene, an opera singer, known as the Diva, is singing classical opera, and then suddenly BOOM! She starts singing opera but with a punkish popish side to it, zingy waves of fast paced electric pop music flying into your awaiting ears and through your brain, instantly changing the mood of the scene. Whilst the Diva is singing, the scene cuts back and forth on time with the beat of the music between the Diva and a fight between Leeloo the Fifth Element and aliens bent on stealing the other 4 elements, the music greatly affecting the feelings happening in the fight.This film entertained me all the way through, and has burnt itself with great detail and a lot of smoke into my memory; I could never forget the colourful electric eccentric hilarious fast paced world of this film. If you ever get the chance to see this film, you should definitely watch it, you will be thoroughly amazed.",

            "content": "I think you've got to forget the story when attempting to appreciate the merits of The Fifth Element. Its narrative is really a load of nonsense. What makes this film interesting is its aesthetics. Luc Besson has always been a director famed for his stylish action films, and this one is no exception. The only major difference of course is that this is science-fiction, and it is unusual to see such a big-budget film of that genre coming out of Europe. Its French origins do show too, with its elegantly attired characters and slightly strange sense of humour. It isn't a film without faults though, as its story about love against evil isn't exactly a strong point.But in terms of imaginative design, The Fifth Element is definitely a success. The streets of the future metropolis are full of life and crazed visual ideas. Bright primary colours abound everywhere and the overall look is certainly very well-conceived. I wouldn't necessarily say that this extends to the characters, as none of them are especially memorable. Even Milla Jovovich in the central role of Leeloo isn't all that well utilized in my opinion. She only gets to flex her muscles on the rarest of occasions and is in the main just a victim to be protected. Bruce Willis is of course her saviour, with Gary Oldman pitching in with a strange accented villain. For me the best character was the alien opera singer, her scene where she sings an aria while Leeloo engages in a fight with the bad guys is definitely the highlight of the movie.The tone of the film is almost that of a comedy. This is not a film that is taking itself in the least bit seriously. This playfulness of approach may be perhaps a bit jarring to some and might take a bit of getting used to. I guess though because of this it's easier to ignore the deficiencies in the story-line department. The Fifth Element is a silly but beautifully presented science fiction action flick and is recommended for those who gravitate to the quirkier side of the genre.",

            "content": "Targeted to lovers of Sci-Fi action comics, this could have been a decent film even if the plot is just an average good vs. evil story. However, the visuals are exuberant, with lots of shiny costumes, gadgets and interesting CGI. Besson started writing this script when he was 16, and it is easy to see it had massive appeal to the above mentioned public (young male).In a distant future, Earth is about to be destroyed by evil forces and only the four elements, reunited by a Fifth can save the planet. The Fifth element takes the shape of a female teenage, very sexy despite - or because - her extreme naivety. The Fifth element, under the name of Leeloo is played by Jovovich, at the time a mere 22 yo. Bruce Willis, 20 years older, is Korben Dallas, her \"love interest\".Therein lies one of the movie's problems, cleverly identified as the \"Born Sexy Yesterday\" (BSY). The term describes young women, totally naive in the ways of the world, but sexually mature. Missing experience, the first man they meet is irresistible and perfect, because they cannot compare him to anybody else. It is a slightly disturbing fantasy, bordering to pathological territory. In Besson's case, he also likes his BSY extremely skinny, almost anorexic and - obviously - half naked throughout the whole movie.Therefore, half-naked Leeloo and Korben run against the clock to save Earth, pursued by assorted enemies, inclusive of a campy Gary Oldman (evil industrialist Zorg) and evil aliens Mangalores. The camp takes a huge overdrive with the entrance of Ruby Rhod, possibly one of the most annoying (and basically useless) characters of the last 50 years. With the entrance of Rhod, what was a half-way decent adventure, turns into an insufferable, shrilly, silly movie.Not for nothing, both Jovovich and Tucker (playing Rhod) were both nominated for Golden Raspberries. Disappointingly, though, Tucker did not win, even if the award would have been well deserved.",

He's a really talented visual director, and you can see that he's having a great time.\nThe cast is also worth mention, Willis is good playing Corben Dallas, but Gary Oldman steals the show playing Zorg.\nThe movie has a big sense of fun, It's very entertainning.\nIn terms of negative aspects, it's problably a little too long and the script like I said before it's not that original.\nOverall the Fifth Element is a visually stunning movie filled with a decent script, good directing, ideas, and it has above all a huge sense of fun.7.5/10",

Only the fifth element can stop the Evil from extinguishing life, as it tries to do every five thousand years. She is helped by ex-soldier, current-cab-driver, Korben Dallas, who is, in turn, helped by Prince/Arsenio clone, Ruby Rhod. Unfortunately, Evil is being assisted by Mr. Zorg, who seeks to profit from the chaos that Evil will bring, and his alien mercenaries.There is one flaw in this film. It's kinda long with its slow start. Apart from that, after thirty minutes, it a smooth ride from there. This is what you would want in a popcorn movie. You have the great action sequences with the great special effects and you also have the lovable characters!Visually, the movie is amazing! The set designs are fantastic and the costumes and effects are great! I just loved this movie because not only it was entertaining at best, it was also very funny with it's clever comedic scenes.The acting by Bruce Willis was mediocre. I never thought of him as a great actor anyway. Gary Oldman's, Ian Holm's, and Chris Tucker's performance were funny and probably the best was Milla Jovovich. She learned an entire different language (made up by the director, Luc Besson) and spoke it so clearly in the movie!If you just want a very entertaining popcorn film with very funny scenes and great action sequences with breath taking effects, this is the perfect movie! It's just refreshing to see a movie that don't take itself too seriously to make it that good!",

Bruce Willis was great in this scene, and it would be his best gun-play scene had he not done last man standing. But other than a few great scenes, and when I say great- I mean just that, this movie had stupid cartoon dialog and some hall of shame-worthy over acting.The plot is kind of hard to swallow at times. It can be complex, but can also be shortened for those of whom don't like to think very much during a film. The basic plot is as follows; Bruce Willis plays a bad motherf*cker named Corben Dallas, who has lost his wife and is slumming it in futuristic Brooklyn. He is a former pilot who worked for the government- now, well... not so much. He is a taxi driver who, up until the first day you meet him, has a license with 3 marks on it I believe. After that day though, he ends up with the supreme being falling through the roof of his cab, his 3 marks being taken away along with his license and his job, and to top it all off- this chick can't speak a word of English. Now he goes to a priest, the priest that the chick keeps talking about- yelling out his name and so forth. This priest is an expert on the matter, and until Corben Dallas and his supreme being friend came knocking on his door, he thought mankind was doomed. Corben signs up, unwillingly, to do one last mission for the government, seeing as how he already was knee deep in it, and is set up to win a contest- putting him on a ship with some sacred stones that he has to retrieve. You know, it is not as complicated as it sounds, in fact it's quite an easy film to follow, but on paper... not so much.So anyway, this film was very entertaining, and seeing as how I just watched total recall this morning- I felt the need to go out and rent the fifth element. They remind me of each other for some reason. I heard through the grapevine that the first draft of this film was written by Luc Besson in the 10th grade. Now I'm not sure if this is true or not, and I am way too lazy to check on the IMDb.com trivia section- if it's even there. But anyway, if you're bored and want a cool film that is very, very sci-fi- then you should definitely rent this. I'd say it redeems itself for all the cartoonish dialog and over-acting when they reach the Oprah, but then again- I liked the film as a whole. Bruce Willis is excellent, as is Gary Oldman, but Milla Jovovich (spelling?) is phenomenal. Excellent to say the least. Too bad she went on and did resident evil.This was worth a 7/10. Just about as good as Total Recall, although I forget what I gave total recall.",

            "content": "\"The fifth element\" is a big, sugary slice of space opera, with a screenplay that feels as if was written by two twelve-year-olds on the back of an old envelope. (Think \"Flash Gordon\" with a sprinkling of psychedelic glitter.) The plot does not really bear repeating or summarizing, but it goes a bit like this : Good and Evil, aka Life and Death, wage war on a vast cosmic scale, involving scores of soldiers both witting and unwitting. These wild and diverse armies contain persons of human, alien and (possibly) supernatural origin from all walks of life : warriors, monks, taxi drivers, celebrities, scientists and yes, even opera singers.How to rate the movie ? This is a difficult question, since parts of it are good, parts of it are unremarkable and parts of it are bad. The bad straddles two different categories - simply bad versus so bad that it becomes good - and on top of it all there's a layer of knowing wit. I'm slapping six stars on it, for \"feel free to watch it, but only once\", but I can fully understand other ratings.\"The fifth element\" certainly delivers in the style and beauty department. Some of the best French graphic artists, illustrators and designers collaborated on the project, and it shows. The superbly inventive costumes, for instance, contribute to the general whackiness and extravagance of the movie, by fooling around with concepts of sexuality, gender and even species.Other aspects are far less impressive. The taxi driver protagonist, for instance, lives in what seems like a surveillance and police state. The police certainly aren't going for the calmly didactic approach : they wear frightening uniforms, use heavily muscled methods and think nothing of pulverizing the odd miscreant. But the movie does nothing with these concepts - this dysfunctional background could just as well be multicolored wallpaper.Aaah, science fiction, the genre that likes to tackle big, dangerous ideas !",

The movie draws from genres of sci-fi in its world, spaceship and props designs; a bit of western in terms of show-downs, dialogue and character subplots; and finally the second half of the movie is a buddy cop movie with John Mclaine and his 90s-stapled african-american funny side kick. THe movie is pure entertainment and might lack a little more depth to its backstory as it does an incredible time jump at the beginning without explaining anything that happened in between.

It doesn't make you think much and it is pretty much a good date movie which can appeal to a large audience. Still the twists and turns are quite interesting enough to make this an entertaining sci-fi adventure movie ala Star wars.A cab driver in the future(in the 23rd century) has the job of protecting a woman who is the only hope against the destruction of the earth. This woman is actually an alien from another planet. The cab driver Korben Dallas(Bruce Willis) who is heartbroken from a previous marriage slowly falls in love with her. The President of the world and a priest Father cornelius are also interested in the girl in order to save the world. There is no great twist towards the end but the many twists and turns in the plot are quite entertaining and are not jarring to the central plot. There is also a villain Jean Baptiste Zorg(Gary Oldman) who wants to get the items from the girl in order to destroy them to enable the destruction of the earth. Most of the scenes have a sort of wry humour which is common in these types of adventure films. The villain himself is a character with some funny lines. There are also other characters to add more hilarity to the plot.The special effects are the first thing that can be noticed about this movie. It can be seen why this movie was so expensive. The special effects are ahead of its time and the special effects don't seem overdone. Milla jovovich as the woman Leeloo has given an adequate performance. Gary Oldman's performance was my favourite in this movie as he shows no hint of the over the top performance that he did in Leon. Here he is perfect as the villain who will do anything to create chaos in the world. The many scenes he appears in are quite light hearted. Even the scene towards the end with the bomb is also quite hilarious. The only irritant in this movie is Chris tucker who has given a really over the top performance as the anchor Ruby Rhod. At some points, his voice is grating and his presence seems jarring. His comic scenes with the air hostesses are not all that funny and are quite an irritant. The role of the priest has also been done in a more restrained funny manner. The makeup of the aliens has also been done excellently.Overall you won't be disappointed as it has some good action scenes and great special effects. And of course Milla Jovovich's costume.7/10",

Friendly aliens have been keeping a weapon to fight evil on Earth, but in 1913 it is determined the weapon is no longer safe on Earth. 300 years later, Milla Jovovich as Leeloo, a friendly alien, meets Bruce Willis as Korben Dallas, a taxi drive at the end of his rope.\nZorg, portrayed by Gary Oldman has made a deal with an evil entity. The weapon from the beginning of the movie is his quest. He fails again and again. I believe the theme of this movie is the power of love, how it binds us, and how love can transcend time and space to smite evil and allow life to continue in the universe.\nKorben takes Leeloo to Cornelius, a priest played by Ian Holm. He is a descendent of the priest from 300 years ago, and has been expecting Leeloo. The progress stalls for a bit until the weapon, four stones, is recovered. The stones and Leeloo and Korben return to the temple in Egypt where the movie started, and use love, the 5th element to beat evil. All is almost lost as Leeloo questions her purpose, about what we do with the life she is saving. Will we use it for love, or evil?\nThe theme is present throughout the movie. The 5th Element does not push theme in your face. It is a simple story about how love can triumph over evil. Love guides the choices of the caracters throughout the move. The Professor loves Egyptology, and the idea of fame. The priest loves the aliens and preserving his sect. Korben loves his cat.\nEven the bad guy, Zorg loves what he does. He loves being evil. Again and again, throught the movie love beats hate. When Cornelius saves Zorg, he could have just walked away and let Zorg die, but he had to much love for life to let even an evil man die in front of him.\nThose without love will not succeed in their goals. As long as love exists in the universe evil will never triumph. The future will be how we make it. We can allow the Zorgs of this world to channel the hate that exists out there, or we can kiss, with permission, the Leeloos of this world to let love flow.",

I laughed at a lot of parts like when Zorg choked on a cherry and when Leeloo and Korben were having sex in the resurrection chamber(only because I have a twisted sense of humor). And my favorite lines were \"Negative... I am a meat Popsicle, and \"Multipass\". I did like when the Diva got shot and revealed that the stones were inside her though. Ruby was on sh-rooms, and Korben's mother was a bitch. THe movie combines what made the Matrix, and those books I mentioned great, and multiplies it by a whole lot. I still love this movie.

By the end of the year, the movie grossed over $263,920,180, making it the 9th highest-grossing film of the year. After seeing The Fifth Element, I was surprised to realize that the entire story and ideas came from an teenage boy. Who's that teenage boy you might ask? It came from the film's director and writer, Luc Besson. Besson came up with the story while he was in high school. As a movie, it is more than meet the eye.The story begins with a text, saying, \"Egypt, 1914.\" Aliens called Mondoshawans come to Earth to collect a weapon that can be use to defeat a Great Evil that appears every 5,000 years. The weapon consists of four stones. Each has its classification of elements. All four stones revolved around a fifth element, which is represented in the form of a human. Before leaving Earth, the aliens promise that they will return the four stones in time to stop the Great Evil. The movie then fast forwards to the 23rd century, in the year 2263, where New York City cab driver, Korben Dallas, (Bruce Willis), is an ordinary everyday man that sort of like the kind of guy Willis played in Die Hard, sort to think. Anyway, the Great Evil appears space in the form of a giant black ball of fire. Vito Cornelius, (Ian Holm), informs the president the background history of the Great Evil. As the Mandoshawans head to Earth, another race of aliens, the bad kind, the Mangalores, who work for Zorg, (Gary Oldman), decides to shoot down the Mandoshawans' ship. Even though the stones weren't on board, there is one thing that does survive. The hand of the fifth element. Scientists then create an beautiful alien named Leeloo, (Milla Jovovich). But Leeloo escapes and finds herself falling into Dallas' cab. After a rocky start, Dallas realizes that he must protect Leeloo from danger because she is the fifth element, as we learn later on in the movie.Now, you might think that The Fifth Element is a very bad science- fiction movie, right? Well, it isn't. In fact, I really enjoyed this movie because of the film's amazing and dazzling special effects. In fact, I like to point out that this the first science-fiction movie I've seen where the future is not at all depressing or screwed up in any way. I like this kind of future. I would definitely get lost in this kind of world. The way the colors are used in the movie and the way different shapes are used is something stunning. I really enjoyed the fact that the movie had time to stop for humor because there are a number of funny moments that are in this movie. Most of them come from Chris Tucker, who plays an radio DJ, who is very very eccentric. He really generates much of the movie's funny moments. At certain times, the gears do shift once in awhile. But, it did worked. The cinematography of the movie is very good and I also admired the costume design, which was done by Jean Paul Gaultier.However, even though I'm given a lot of credit to the technical aspects of the movie and to the story, the movie does run on a little too long. Clocking in at 2 hours and 7 minutes, the movie shouldn't been edited into a more tighter time space. I would definitely cut back on some of the opening scene of the movie because I felt it did go on for a little while. But that aside, I did have a good time watching this movie. I believed in the story that Besson had to offered although the most interesting thing about his story is that it isn't like Star Wars. When I mean is that in the Star Wars movies, there are a lot of ideas and pieces that are burrowed from other movies. In a way, those pictures are like puzzles. However, The Fifth Element isn't like Star Wars. There isn't anything burrowed from other movies in this film, but what we have is an original idea and story that comes from an man who grew up to become an very well-detailed virtuoso. There's a lot of money that was spend on the making of this movie, but Besson sure knows how to spend it. This is one ride that you would like to take again. \u2605\u2605\u2605 3 stars.",

All of this makes every scene seem out of the ordinary.\nNow with this different background the plot is pretty routine, evil is going to destroy the world with a few more religious overtones added than usual. Bruce Willis turns in an expectedly good performance. Milla Jovovich plays a very off beat heroine well. Gary Oldman is an equally unusual villain. The special effects are good. There is plenty of humor throughout the movie and even though sometimes a joke misses (for instance with the mother of the Willis character) I found the movie fun. On top of all this there is plenty of shooting and explosions.  Now there is something about obnoxious characters. They don't bother me so much in a sci-fi movie. Hey, this is supposed to be different so why not weird characters. The Fifth Element has plenty of them including one named Ruby Rhod who makes over the top seem tame.

Okay yes La La Land is impressive and yes Dr. Strange is a good choice certainly but The Fifth Element is the classic film to show off one's new HD goodness. It truly is a visual treat. You have the film's visual style from Jean Giraud and Jean-Claude M\u00e9zi\u00e8res mixed with the costumes designed by Jean Paul Gaultier.Well, first I was going to list all the horrible films that are on 4k Blu-ray while this one isn't.

Truly everything about this film is fun. Even the stuff you really didn't like the first few viewings (I'm looking your way Chris Tucker) seems to grow on you.The only strange thing that somehow still works but is jarring every viewing is the ridiculous over the top product placement for McDonalds. I swear The Founder had less golden arches. Some might also object to the rampant sexism, Tiny Lister's acting, Luke Perry's acting, and the general way the plot sometimes seems to play out.The Fifth Element has many layers that are not apparent at first. As an example, the good guy and the bad guy not just never meet in the film but are completely unaware of each other's existence. Here is the kicker.

The tasty blue-orange combination may linger in your thoughts for some time. Plenty of action but not overloaded. The futuristic metropolis is loaded with visual effects that are excellent, so you'll have to look hard to point out inconsistencies. But I'm glad the special effects stop with spaceships and scenery and do not continue with the making of the alien characters. There is a plethora of costumes and make-up, which gives the movie life. However, you can load a movie with art and still suffer by way of plot, dialog, and acting. But this is where The Fifth Element excels. The story is simply one of good versus evil but along the way there's a dose of unpredictability as far as where the good guys are headed and who they'll encounter. Just add in the sci-fi flavor and you get a tale of wonderment which doesn't let up. Bruce Willis, Gary Oldman, Milla Jovovich, and Ian Holm all produce the necessary passion for their deep characters and the splendid dialog. My appreciation for all of this has increased since when I first saw it at the theater in '97. There was a lot for me to process so it took me several views to fully absorb this fine experience. Action/adventure, comedy, love, and drama have been intertwined into this mesmerizing work of art for the eyes and ears. Do enjoy.",

            "content": "This is a popular sci-fi blockbuster from 1997, but I was a few months shy of eleven years old at the time of its release, and was totally unaware of its existence until several years later. I saw some of it at least twice during my high school years, but the first time I saw the entire film was in 2005 (shortly after finishing high school), and from what I remember, I was a little disappointed. Maybe I didn't exactly think it was bad, but it certainly didn't meet my expectations. After over four years, I finally watched it from start to finish a second time, and as I had hoped, it was definitely better this time. There were some things I couldn't remember from my first viewing, especially towards the end, but as well as being better, my second viewing was also more memorable.Every five thousand years, a great evil comes and threatens all life in the Universe! Four stones (representing fire, air, water, and earth) and a living being known as the Fifth Element together make the only weapon that can stop it! In 1914, three hundred years before this great evil is to return, an extraterrestrial group called the Mondoshawan come to Earth to take the Elements from an ancient tomb in Egypt and keep them safe. Three hundred years later, in an era of flying cars, the Mondoshawan attempt to return to Earth, but are killed by evil aliens called Mangalores! Scientists find a portion of the Fifth Element in the remains of the Mondoshawan ship, and use a machine to recreate it. It comes to life in the form of a human female named Leeloo, who escapes from the laboratory and falls into the backseat of a taxi driven by Korben Dallas, a former military man. He takes her to a priest named Father Vito Cornelius, who knows just who/what she is after he sees the mark on her arm! The priest is searching for the other four elements, but so is the evil Zorg, who has different plans for them! I may not have found this movie very suspenseful the first time I watched it all, but the same cannot be said about the second time. I found a lot of it suspenseful this time, with all the action, starting during the opening sequence, set in 1914 Egypt, and continuing for much of the rest of the film, set in the 23rd century. To add to the quality of \"The Fifth Element\", there are good performances here from Bruce Willis, Milla Jovovich, Ian Holm, Gary Oldman, etc. The film also has some humour, sometimes funny and sometimes not so much. The \"bada boom\" part is pretty annoying, and Chris Tucker as Ruby Rhod isn't a very good comic relief. I may not have found him nearly as annoying as some people probably have, but his antics can be pretty lame. However, there is some good humour, with Zorg (Oldman's character, a better comic relief), Korben hiding military personnel in his fridge, etc. I tend to really like the visuals in these modern sci-fi blockbusters, with the sets and special effects, and the visuals here are no exception. Finally, towards the end, there are some fairly moving scenes.This is not a film I've ever been able to describe as a masterpiece, but after watching it twice, I think it deserves a lot of praise. I'm not sure why I wasn't that impressed the first time. Maybe I wasn't exactly in the right mood, or maybe I had to see it again in order to understand its popularity. Well, whatever the reason was, it definitely improved with a second viewing, as some movies do, and I think I now understand why it's so popular, even if I don't like it as much as many others clearly do. Sure, some of the humour doesn't work (some Chris Tucker gags included), the romance between Korben and Leeloo is sometimes a little cheesy, and those may not be the only two flaws, but apart from that, there's not much I can criticize \"The Fifth Element\" for. If you like a good sci-fi adventure, many would obviously agree that this one is worth a look.",

All it did do was add to my impression that the European temperament does not lend itself to doing either sci-fi or blockbusters or sci-fi blockbusters.Recently, I decided to watch it again, thinking that I (perhaps) judged it too harshly. When I got to the ridiculous scene of Zorg choking on a cherry, I turned it off. No, I was not going to waste another two hours of my life on this awful, awful film.The film is immensely boring: Over and over again, the same over-the-top, silly scenarios are constructed. Everything, every character has to have some kind of oddity, from the opera-singing alien who suddenly riffs into some kind of weird \"pop jazz\" to the various oddball hats, cranial implants, and just-plain-silly hairstyles that are given out to people. None of it shocks or surprises; rather, all it does is bore. You think: \"I wonder which wacko, nutty thing Besson is going to have happen or what ridiculous outfit will Gaultier have them wear?\" And, predictably . . . Does Chris Tucker deserve the \"Jar Jar Binx Award\" for singlehandedly ruining this film? Perhaps, not: The film is already awful. His performance just takes it to a lower level of awfulness.The visuals are, well, the 90's: a lot of mustard yellows, greens, and bright pink. None of it works well together.The costumes are, well, Jean-Paul Gaultier: not designed in any way, shape, or form to be worn by anybody. Imagine a real police officer trying to lumber around in the outfit he designed! The military uniforms are something out of a cartoon. Maybe, that is what Gaultier wanted, namely, to play with different gestalts. But, whereas it might work for a fashion or art show, it does not work here where there has to be some semblance of a reality with people really living with these outfits and clothes. Having gadgets jump out at one from every side or come out of every orifice does not make for an interesting scene. Gaultier seems to ascribe to the philosophy: \"More is more\". It ain't; it just adds clutter.Instead, this movie falls all over itself with trying to remind the viewer at every instant: \"This is a sci-fi film you are watching!\" So overly self-conscious . . . The musical score is intrusive and overbearing.Although I am glad that I refreshed my memory as to why I thought this film was so bad, it is a half hour that I will not get back.",

This film was a bizarre and jumbled mess. It was quirky and silly and an absolute waste of 2 hours. The acting is still good because of Bruce Willis and Mila, Bruce Willis? What was he thinking? The future looked unrealistic and unattractive. We also had a very odd performance from Chris Rock which I do not know what to make off except he was very annoying.

            "content": "From the ecstatic mind of artistic visionary Luc Besson comes one of the most colorful and exciting science fiction adventures ever. The Fifth Element takes place 250 years in the future when humanity is threatened by the arrival of pure evil. The only way to stop this oncoming threat is by harnessing the power of four stones, each representing one of the four elements, through the fifth element which is in the form of a human being named Leeloo, who is played by Milla Jovovich in her breakthrough starring role. Bruce Willis plays Corbin Dallas, the cab driver who through being in the wrong place at the wrong time (or right place at the right time depending on how you look at it), meets Leeloo and must then protect her against those trying to prevent her from stopping evil. These opposing forces are led by the always incredible and over-the-top Gary Oldman. If everything else about this movie sucked, Oldman's incredible performance would still make it worth the watch. The whole film is a wildly fun ride that takes us to a futuristic world full of such vibrancy and adventure that allows us to set aside everything we know as reality, and escape into a whole new and exciting world. And that's what movies should be, right? Not only does The Fifth Element make a good fun escape film, it's simply just a well made film altogether. The story itself doesn't break new boundaries of storytelling, but it is prevalent, focused, and fun. There is however, an excellently weaved in use of comedy on the sci-fi backdrop. There are many elements of this film that are intelligently and appropriately over exaggerated for an effective blend of comedy and drama. Nothing is too overdone, or hammed up, or forced. Some of the dialouge itself might not be perfect, but everything works together very well, and all elements of the film compliment each other nicely. It's easy for a blending of genres to go horribly wrong, but The Fifth Element gets it just right, and a lot of this is due to great characters. The casting choices for this film were nothing short of excellent. I already emphasized it before, but I could not take my eyes off the screen while Gary Oldman was on it.Where The Fifth Element excels the most, however, would be its visuals. There are fantastic backdrops in this film with some great art direction that never leaves you feeling cheated out of seeing some sci-fi goodness. You get to see the facade of some wicked looking buildings, and then are also treated to the bizarre artsy contemporary sci-fi architecture on the inside. What makes this film the most artistically memorable would definitely be the colors. Instead of dwelling on the dark greys and blues that we commonly see in these futuristic urban settings, we have bright vibrant colors that flash, blink, and whir all around us in this fast paced world. But of course in such a beautifully designed world, we have to have a great director to show us this world in all its glory. And The Fifth Element has just the person to achieve this task, and it is Luc Besson. Besson's directing truly does bring this film to life. This is sort of a \"no duh\" statement but if you've seen the movie you'll know what I mean. The man can shoot an action sequence like no other, and this film has no shortage of action. There are plenty of memorable scenes ranging from high above the ground in flying cars, to an opera house full of aliens (and a Prince clone). Besson can direct these electrifying scenes with such precise editing ability that you don't miss a thing, only sucking you into the action of this film even more. And as an added note I would have to say that The Fifth Element has one of the neatest portrayals of the flying car I have ever seen.It's fun, it's fast paced, it's bright, it's vivid, and it's incredibly well made. Why wouldn't you see The Fifth Element? This is definitely one of those films that is hard not to enjoy. From start to finish it's an exciting sci-fi adventure that grabs hold of mind and never lets go until the end.",

If the performance sucks then no harm no foul. Every second past that is unpaid overtime. That whole last third from the departure to the fantasy planet onwards was as though Besson said \" I can't make up my mind between sci fi and forced camp.\" If there's a hell below intentional camp I'd like to know what it is. It began subtly with the jewish mother jokes and the General's crew stuffed in the freezer, by the fight scene it was outta control. Bruce Willis had a great action sequence, overshadowed by Tucker's shrill-bitch running commentary. He's not saving the world anymore, he's saving the girly-man from burping aliens. Like fake boobs, you get less pleasure staring at them right after watching the operation. Not only is it false advertising, but now you know you're being taken for a sucker. I kept watching with the hope Tucker would drop out of sight or a plot twist might keep it interesting, but got the feeling by the end that the Besso didn't give a damn anymore either.",

It is a superb story with all of the proper ingredients in it: humor, action, love and thriller-sensation. The director, Luc Besson does a formidable job and the script is also superb. Bruce Willis, starring in his second sci-fi movie on a short time(the first was twelve monkies) delivers as usual a very earthbound caracter with the basic ideals and a swift mouth. Milla Jovovich shows that she is not only very pretty but also a talented actress that I think everybody hopes to see on the screen again. And last, but not least Mr Oldman who shows again what a brilliant actor he is, he delivers the second most scary character he has ever made- nothing beats the one in Besson's \"Leon\". So I must say that I strongly recommend you to watch this movie A.S.A.P. 9/10",

            "content": "While I had missed out on this on initial release and various TV airings over the years, it now ended up being my second BluRay viewing! It was Bruce Willis' second of 3 sci-fi epics made in the space of as many years \u2013 the others being the superior TWELVE MONKEYS (1995) and the even lesser Armageddon (1998). Luc Besson often dabbled in fantasy and, though re-united with Gary Oldman from LEON (1994), this proved the French director's first real brush with Hollywood.The film is redolent of two earlier genre landmarks, namely STAR WARS (1977; in its plethora of monstrous characters) and BLADE RUNNER (1982; the 'chaotic' look); plot-wise, it owes a bit to RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK (1981) given the danger-fraught odyssey relating to an archaeological find. Casting, too, channels famous (musical/film) personalities with Oldman's campy villain evoking David Bowie, while Chris Tucker's outrageous but irrelevant TV show host brings to mind Prince!; in a similar key, actors from earlier classic sci-fi titles have been recruited: Ian Holm from ALIEN (1979), Brion James from BLADE RUNNER itself and John Neville who, though best-known for THE ADVENTURES OF BARON MUNCHAUSEN (1989), was also the lead of the low-budgeted but superb UNEARTHLY STRANGER (1963).As expected, the film looks great (showcasing imaginative production/costume design and special effects) and, while the central theme is interesting (if hardly original), the ending is a disappointment: Oldman is dispatched before the climax and by his own volatile 'thugs' to boot, whereas a super alien promising a showdown with the Forces of Good is conveniently dealt with by the ray of light unleashed when the mythic five elements come together in Egypt (some form of direct confrontation would not have been amiss at this point)! Incidentally, the ruse of forcing Willis (here sporting blond hair) to admit his love for heroine Milla Jovovich obviously rips-off the finale of Howard Hawks' RIO BRAVO (1959) \u2013 just as the couple's lovemaking being interrupted by suddenly adulating authority figures smacks of the James Bond movies! By the way, Besson would probably be deemed a visionary now, not so much for his futuristic films, but for daring to make the American President a black man (though DEEP IMPACT {1998} soon after employed the very same device)! The film, then, is action-packed, thus reasonably entertaining, but it also contains a number of flaws \u2013 mainly Tucker's embarrassing and overbearing character and the supreme silliness of having an alien for a singing operatic diva (actually, the whole over-the-top section on the flying cruise-liner was a mistake)! On the other hand, Jovovich and Oldman (helped in no small measure by their respectively sparse and gaudy attire) are a delight throughout and the main reason for watching this...",

Movies back then (80 ~ 90 and some of 00's) where more courageous, directors weren't afraid of craziness and nonsense. More art could be expressed, more challenging scenes! I miss this! This movie shows this things clearly, actors are very into this whole new universe and the universe itself is well developed. As a Isaac Asimov reader I approve this science fiction. Now lets talk specifics... I always write for you guys to help choosing this movie to watch, so this is why and when I think you should get this one: If you are into Sci-Fi get this movie, no matter what. It has some plot issues like things happening too fast and some weak comedy in scenes that don't need or match the requirements... but still this is a great Sci-Fi. You'll be able to enjoy even the lifestyle of the universe, the clothes, the environment, the mores. Just do it. As for any other, you should watch to experience a movie that doesn't work on the character development or on the people interactions but it develops an entire new universe so you can enjoy thinking of it. It may be your intro to Sci-Fi since it is a light Sci-Fi with easy to understand rules.Finally for the bads... This movie has some problems. Some times the scenes go too fast and it is somewhat hard to understand why somethings are to be that way. The movie doesn't end well too because of that, for some reason in the end near the climax, things start to solve really fast for idiotic reasons. That doesn't ruin the movie but instead shows how much potential it have if those were to be fixed. It deserves the 7 it has.",

Taking part in a poll for the best films of 1997,I decided that it was time for me to plea the fifth.The plot:Every 5,000 years a weapon made up of the four classical elements (and a \"chosen\" human acting as the fifth) must be made to stop the only weapon that can destroy the universe from successfully working. Finding that the aliens who vowed to guard the elements have been killed by Jean-Baptiste Emanuel Zorg, a group of scientists bring one of the aliens back to life,via re-construction. Instead of coming back as one of the aliens, Leeloo comes to life as the fifth element. Escaping the lab, Leeloo crashes into the cab of Korben Dallas,who joins Leeloo in going in search for the other four elements.View on the film:Going to space as the (at the time) most expensive European film ever made, director Luc Besson & cinematographer Thierry Arbogast take their Cin\u00e9ma du look stylisation to a galactic level,with Besson wiping out any hint of darkness with a Pop Art vibrancy of Comic- Book coloured reds,yellows and blues giving the adventure a pristine shine.Planning the film since his teens,Besson (and costume designer Jean-Paul Gaultier-who personally checked the costumes of five hundred extras used in one scene!) lovingly pay attention to detail in every scene, from the unique appearance of each monstrous alien,to all the items in Dallas's run-down cab.Mixing three separate screenplays together to form one movie, the screenplay by Besson and Kamen rolls out a thrilling Sci-Fi adventure,where the threat of the world going dark keeps the live wires lit,as Dallas follows Leeloo's search across the galaxies.Although Ruby Rhod is a bit on the \"loud\" side, (played by a jiving Chris Tucker) the writers paint the five elements with a refreshing level of humour,that bubbles up from Leeloo's funny fish out of water experience.While stating that his feelings on the flick were \"Oh no. I can't bear it.\" (he made it due to Besson helping to fund Nil by Mouth) Gary Oldman gives a wonderfully wacky performance as baddie Jean-Baptiste Emanuel Zorg, (who uniquely,never comes face to face with the goodies)who Oldman turns into a loose cannon that can go off any moment.Creating an alien language with Besson (who she would later get married to) for the film, Milla Jovovich casts an otherworldly atmosphere on the movie in her great performance as Leeloo,thanks to Jovovich having to making Leeloo come out of her alien,fish out of water state,in order to complete the five elements.",

            "content": "I've heard more than one person compare this film to Blade Runner (one [out of several] of my favorite sci-fi films of the 80s), despite the somewhat similar settings, it's hard to imagine two more different films.  This colorful sci-fi action spoof is also a marked contrast to Besson's previous films La Femme Nikita and Leon (known as The Professional here in the States), but does share some similarities with them.  Much like Nikita and Leon have a distinctive French style to them (even though the latter is set in the U.S.), The Fifth Element takes a lot of stylistic cues from French and Japanese comic books, both of which I'm a fan of, particularly Moebius (who contributed some designs to The Fifth Element) and Shirow Masamune (speaking of which, watch for a volume of the excellent Yakuza (Japanese for gangster) comic Sanctuary in Korben Dallas' apartment).The film isn't set so much in the future, more of a futurized comic book version of the world that Nikita and Leon are set in.  I always find futuristic worlds that are still grappling with contemporary problems more interesting, maybe that's part of why I've never found the utopian world of Star Trek very interesting.From my understanding, Besson wrote an early draft of the story in high school (along with an early draft of the under-appreciated The Big Blue), which I think is cool, since I can relate, because in school, I had (as of yet, unrealized) dreams of being a filmmaker, and I would often draw cartoons or write stories to help relieve the tedium of high school.  Of course, most of them were crap, and have no chance in hell of ever being made into a film.Besson has a wonderful visual style, here, it's very interesting to see him apply that style to a sci-fi world rather than a contemporary world (as in his films from Subway to Leon) or a bleak post-apocalypse world (as in the lesser known than it should be Le Dernier Combat).  Of course, credit is also due to production designer Dan Weil and cinematographer Thierry Arbogast (Arbogast's cinematography was one of the few redeeming features of the dismal Wing Commander).  Along with John Woo, Luc Besson is my favorite action director (they may have a three-way tie with the Wachowski brothers if they make more films like The Matrix). Eric Serra's excellent musical score is also worth mentioning.  I really enjoyed seeing Gary Oldman repeat his villain role from Leon, although in this film, his character is more cartoonish than evil.  I also really like a lot of the visual humor Besson included, like the cigarettes that are 3/4ths filter, and the well-edited sequence when the jet is taking of for Flosthon Paradise.A couple of complaints though, I would've liked to see Jean Reno play Korben Dallas, not that Bruce Willis did a bad job.  I wonder if Reno was originally cast for the part, but backed out.  Reno is one of my favorite actors, I could really imagine him in the role.  Another thing, I've never found Milla Jovovich's fight scene very believable, maybe I'm just spoiled from having seen so many kung fu movies, particularly the newer ones, like with Jet Li.  There are also a few plot holes and lapses in logic, but I choose not to worry about them too much, this isn't a film to take seriously or over-analyze.  I say if you can't enjoy the occasional silly action flick (like this one, which succeeds admirably on that level), you're taking life too seriously.",

The story is very predicatble and probably childish, but the film is unique for Luc Besson's perception of science-fiction, and funny alien monsters, etc. His camera work and direction is outstandingly unique and comparible to his other 2 well-known films. The costume and fashion designs are pretty orgional too, along with garry Oldman's psychotic, and Chris Trucker's lady-king preformances to take you on a roller coaster spins of action and adventure.Overall, it's not bad for a watch, and can be watched again at regular intervals of the year.

They're not only chased by the military but by Zorg (Gary Olman) who has linked himself with Evil and plans to get 4 stones that Leeloo needs to save the universe, but for less altruistic reasons then her. What follows is a great action packed movie. Chris Tucker as DJ Ruby Rhod is pretty annoying at times, but it isn't as much so as to aversely affect my accolades for the film. All the primary actors are great, the action set pieces are a blast and the computer generated scenery is much more appealing then the one's found in Star Wars: Episodes 1 and 2. While it may not be my favorite Luc Besson film (That high honor goes to Leon), it still is a fun ride.My Grade: B 2-DVD set Extras: Disc 1) A fact track Disc 2) 6 featurettes ( Visual, Digital, star, Alien, Fashion, and the Diva); visual Tests; Screen tests (including 4 for Milla Jovovich the second one with her in a great black see-thru number); Poster Gallery; and Trailers for \"the Forgotten\", \"Leon: The Professional\", & \"Mirrormask\"Eye Candy: Milla Jovovich is briefly topless two times",

How can I believe a movie, when in the very beginning for example, a man cannot see and feel thousands of watts lights, several aliens walking like elephants right behind his back? When an educated man is crying to obviously very hi-tech creatures that he will \"shoot\"? And why these creatures are speaking English between themselves? It's ridiculous.

Leeloo learns about all the bad and nasty things in the world through a cyber-Brittanica and becomes morose.  Oooh, wow, try walking through an American city sometime, hon.

            "content": "I like my science fiction but this film was just so out there I didn't know what to make of it in the end. It started off a bit like \"2001\" with the future ominously impinging on the recent past but started to lose me the minute hulking aliens which looked like St Bernard dogs who'd been too long in the rain arrived on the scene to attempt to steal the secret of the mysterious fifth element. Along the way they make an uneasy alliance with intergalactic master-criminal Zorg played by Gary Oldman and threaten the world with an Armageddon-type peril. Lucky for us all then that maverick retired space-captain Bruce Willis is in hand to save the world, just like he would in \"Armageddon\" a few years later too.The plotting, characterisations and cinematography are so wacky that you really do wonder what colour the snow is in director Luc Bresson's world, although at a guess I'd say orange. Willis gets involved when the newly but fully born Mira Sarvoni, literally what the world was waiting for, drops in on him when he's riding around in his air-taxi. Before too long, Willis is heading off to a far flung planet to try and get his hands on the four precious jewels which apparently are the keys to the universe before Oldman does.Along the way he encounters a transsexual dee-jay / reality TV host, a hermaphrodite disco-opera singer and a veteran priest but unsurprisingly it takes a combination of fire- power and stunt work to save the day in spectacular beat-the-clock fashion and wouldn't you know, he gets the girl too.While I was never bored watching it, I'm not sure I was ever fully engaged by it, its weird combination of campness and thrills just not quite working for me. Willis is his usual laconic self, Oldman goes for Ming the Merciless but comes off unintentionally as Dr Evil while Sorvino is just awkward and ultimately sex-less as the infant-savage with her shock of red hair and prototype mankini outfit. Some of the scenes were literally eye-popping, like the first sighting of the air-traffic in the future New York and the explosive gun-fight at the climax but as a film it just didn't hold together enough for me. If the future really is this bright I should have worn shades.",

The movie sets the colors the props everything is beautiful. Although I do not always like the costumes and I want to ask a few questions in some design decisions, I would say that the movie is a masterpiece. (From a visual point of view) But then he is pulled down by the fact that the script looks as if it had written a small child or comes from a children's book. The narrative style, the narrative structure everything is cooked really soft and fade the characters are quite okay but the dialogues are, please do not misunderstand, too stupid for science fiction. Especially during the climax I had the feeling that every moment \"Dora the Explorer\" shows up and asks for me help.However, I think Dora got lost in the plot holes, no plot caves. Not every story has to be infinitely complicated but if you make a movie out of it, we expect it to be a movie and if this movie has a PG-13, then I'll rate that as well. I am against the age restrictions, but even as a 13 year old boy would this cheap narrative + black and white representation of good and evil bother me tremendously.The story is the most important thing that makes a good movie and when I get such a \"My Little Pony Fanfiction\" that even my 5 year old cousin finds miserable mixed with costumes and furniture that belong in a museum, then I get headaches, depressions and gripes at the same time. I think it's a pity that all these wonderful set pieces and technological details are stuck between this crap of script. I'd rather have a movie with a fantastic script and awful flaws than the other way around.Bruce Willis is fantastic as always he could play a Nazi and I would still like the man. Chris Tucker is unbearable but Milla Jovovich has anything in this performance which just fills me with hate. I do not know what it is, whether it's her voice her costume or the way she talks like a baby, something annoys me so much that I always want to skip her parts because I'm afraid I'm going to go crazy. I like Gary Oldman but here he is totally wasted in this movie Zorg is a totally superfluous character that has no (major) impact on the course of the story.It's also really difficult to assign a fixed genre to this movie, what is it? Is this Comedy Action, SciFi Action, SciFi Comedy? Is it satire, is it serious or a costume orgy?PS: A lot of people like that the protagonist and antagonist never meet firstly Zorg is not the antagonist but only a lackey from the real villain, we never met our hero, Korben Dallas do not know about Zorg's existence or its influence the whole thing. That's why it's not worth mentioning. I like that the film has a theme of 5 that is a nice Easter Egg what I did not notice the first time.But on the other hand film has two TV troops I loathe as a solution to the problems.My conclusion: applause for Luc Besson ideas and cinematography but I can do without his films.",

How in the actual heck did a great actor like Bruce Willis get involved in this movie?

The entire film is just a confusing mess? Huh?Anyway, The Fifth Element is a poorly-written, ridiculously-executed and utterly unenjoyable idea in the first place. The story, which is what seems to be getting all the praise and adoration from so many audiences and critics (is it?), is just boring, messy and way too all-over-the-place.

And because one knows it isnt meant to be taken seriously, one can just relax and go with the wild flow of this bizarre science fiction comedy in which Milla Jovovich is an alien that must save the earth from an attack. Bruce Willis is there to protect her. And the ever evil Gary Oldman is out to kill them both. Complicated yet dumb story, but the action and the jokes are good enough to get entertained. Kids would love it. Most adults could love it too if they are into Bruce Willis and have an affection for other weird movies of Luc Besson. His directing style is very wild and imaginative, but he achieves to make very enjoyable movies out of absurd stories. The fifth element isnt a very great comedy, but it is still very enjoyable, because director Luc Besson's style is so unique and playful.",

In the summer of 1914 with nothing but war and destruction to look forward to on earth aliens landed near the ancient Egyptian ruins to retrieve the four magical stones. The stones represent the four elements, water earth wind & fire.They were to be put away to avoid from being destroyed until three hundred years in the future. That's when Evil is to be unpleased and where they'll be needed to combat it with the help of a catalyst the critical fifth element, the perfect human being, to defeat it.It's now three hundred years later and Evil, in the form of a massive fireball, is headed towards earth threatening to knocked the blue and green planet out of it's orbit and destroy every living thing on it. The earth enters into a battle between good and evil. Evil is represented by the greedy and immoral Emanuel Zorg, Gary Olman, who with the help of the alien Mondoshawans is determined to get his hands on the four ancient stones, elements,to keep them from fusing together with the fifth to prevent the fireball from crashing into earth. Good is represented by Father Vito Cornelius, Ian Holm, who knows that time is very short in preventing evil from prevailing and knows that without the important fifth element evil will be impossible to stop. Like in almost every important event over the course of history it takes an obscure person being taxi driver and former special forces major Korban Dallas, Bruce Willis, to put all the pieces together. Dallas almost single handedly save the world but he couldn't do it without a passenger that dropped in, laterally, on the backseat of his cab. A reconstructed alien Leeloo, Milia Jovovich, the elusive Fifth Element.With Zorg desperately trying to get the important four stones he's stymied at every turn together with his bumbling alien allies. Dallas is given the assignment to find the stones by Presient Linberg, Tommy Tiny Liser. The intelligence report he gets is that there's a good chance that the stones are hidden somewhere at Fhloston Paradise cruse spaceship. Dallas is fixed, by the secret service, to win a contest to get a trip for two, together with Leeloo, to Fhloston. On the spaceship he discovers that the stones are in the possession of the resorts main attraction singer Diva Plavalagunma, Malwenn Lebesco. The second half of \"The Fifth Element\" explodes with the force of a super nova as Dallas and Father Cornelius ,not to mention Leeloo, have it out with the forces of evil represented by Zorg and Co on the cruse ship with almost everyone there ending up vaporized. Zorg loses the support of the Mondoshawans when Dallas knocks off their fearless leader, who was holding Father Cornelius hostage. Leaving them as helpless as a body without a head or brain. Zorg is left on the Fhloston Paradise pleasure cruse spaceship, as Dallas & Co.exit it, that detonates in a fairy explosion from a bomb that he and his alien cohorts planted there. It's now up to Dallas together with Leeloo and Father Cornelius and his young assistant David, Charlie Creed-Miles, as well as the Fhloston Paradise Master of Ceremonies Ruby Rhod, Chris Tucker, to get back to the Egyptian ruins. To find and put all the pieces together, the five elements, and hope that they have enough time left to do it before the earth is reduced to a burning cinder.Corny but extremely entertaining movie that you can't at all take seriously. Just sit back and enjoy the show with a tongue and cheek performance by Bruce Willis as Korben Dallas. Dallas in the movie lost his job as a cab driver and his wife, who ran off with his lawyer, as well as having his nagging mother not leaving him alone for even a moment constantly threatening to throw herself into traffic. In the end all that pales by comparison to what he's up against in his heroic effort to save the world from the forces of evil both on earth as well as in deep space.",

The army, an order of priests, an alien race of warriors and some criminals, all trying to be the first to get hold of the five elements.The story combines SF, action, drama, romance, and comedy, in a way that is at times totally ridiculous, but this film should not be taken seriously, because its sole goal is to entertain and it does it more than well. Technically it is top-notch and at that time it was the most expensive film made outside Hollywood. The cast, besides Milla Jovovich, includes many well-known faces, such as Bruce Willis, Gary Oldman, Ian Holm, Luke Perry, and Brion James, and although their performances are not Oscar material, the characters are diverse, original and very entertaining, and for this type of film, they are just right. The directing is great, there are some excellent cadres, and the special effects are amazing for that time. There are also aria unachievable for the human voice, performed by a singer whose name is in the Serbian language, the biggest explosion ever recorded indoors, the language invented especially for this film, creations by Jean-Paul Gautier and a multitude of ingenious details.

The age old battle of Good and Evil is played out once again, this time to the tune of hovercraft, light-speed travel, and aliens. And the only thing stopping Earth from being consumed by destruction is Milla Jonovich and 4 old rocks. Sounds like we're in trouble, huh? Watch the seen where Leeloo (Milla) takes on a small army of baddies and wins, and you'll agree it's a good thing she's on our side.And of course Bruce Willis is there too, blowing things up and gunning down the baddies like only he can. In true Willis style, he snaps wisecracks left and right and also has the perfect line. Only Willis can shoot an alien in the head and crack a joke three seconds later. Chris Tucker also comes on board as a Radio DJ in a skin-tight leopard print bodysuit. The ladies in the film call Tucker's character 'Ruby Rhod' sexy and talented. Korben (Bruce Willis) holds him by the throat and tells him to keep his trap shut and leave him alone. Odds are that anyone who sees Tucker in this movie won't blame him. Surprisingly, even Tucker does his part to save the world. Although afterwards he whines and complains about it.Guiding Korben is an old priest and his apprentice. The priest wants to save the world. To do it, he stows away on a ship, knocks out Bruce Willis, and pretty much tells off the President (of Earth, not just the U.S.). This guy isn't your typical Sunday pastor! Also in the run for life are the President and the army. The President almost cries at the end, and the head of the army gets trapped in a freezer and frozen. Makes you wonder how they ever got into power...Opposing the Good are the Bad and the Ugly: Unlike many other movies, this one doesn't go overboard by featuring aliens left and right. But the Mangalores are fun, pig-like aliens that, like all good villains, are greedy, noisy, violent, and just far too easy to poke fun at. What's a movie without the incompetent henchmen? And Gary Oldman plays the part of Zorg, the cunning, intelligent and evil business man that doesn't realize he's helping to doom mankind. Hm, maybe he isn't that intelligent after all. Putting aside that tiny little flaw, Zorg carries a big gun, loves flamethrowers, and kills anyone who dares stand in his way- including his own employees. What more could you ask for in an evil villain? An outlandish costume? Zorg has it! Don't ask why he wears a piece of plastic that covers half his head, no one knows. But it looks silly, and actually fits in with Zorg's metallic green and orange get-up, so you'll get over it fairly fast. Or burst out laughing, one of the two.Overall, this movie is just plain fun! The villain's constant failures break him down to tears at one point, there's a giant fireball set to consume Earth, and every time we see Bruce Willis with a gun, it's a sure thing someone's gonna get shot. Ancient rituals, a perfect being, Bruce Willis and an all-you-can-kill buffet of explosions, gunfire and general mayhem. If you're looking for a great sci-fi movie, look no further!",

This is achieved in a grand extension by detailing, and full embodiment of characters by their actors. Starting with detailing, soundtracks as a whole, although not the best, were perfectly suited for the plot points and scenarios, however, the opera scene stands out with a pitch perfect assignment in both the tone and the parallel development of the story. Costume detail, mannerisms (all hail Chris Tucker), scenario construction and civilization assembling, which sometimes, in sci-fi movies, sins for lacking, and others for overextending, was developed properly, sometimes with funny quirks, others with deep universe-implying concepts, all these features generate a rich, fascinating, self- sustained, and, at times, distracting from the plot. Which leads us to the reason why the 9 was not the ten, although detailing and acting made this movie stand out, the plot was rather generic and didn't bring something particularly new. This, however, is not necessarily a bad thing, since it also enhances the typical \"save the universe with love\", \"naive girl with rebel ex-military super boyfriend\", \"some aliens are good, some are bad, but really, we use them just as a representation of themselves\", \"if we learned whole our lives and culture in one minute we would be disgusted\", to a point where, sarcasm aside, it genuinely makes it one this classic plot points cinematographic representations, and pretty much makes the viewer unable to dislike the characters, and the movie. Onward to the acting. Bruce Willis delivers a proper protagonist performance, which, by itself, by its linearity, leads to lack of space for improvement or admiration; still, the action scenes, the sarcastic remarks and universe level confidence make it worthy of the movie and fit perfectly on point. Mila Jovanovich, that usually excels as an action actress, also shows an astonishing performance as a more deeply emotional, acting centered Leeloo, while retaining Mila's skills, as the godly beautiful, inhumanly perfect Supreme Being. Gary Oldman, with a solid performance in a cast type that, as usual, is different than any other previously performed by the actor, constitutes a strong, credible, ruthless enemy, leaving the audience pitying him for not being the main villain, that however, would probably not have been as much \"Universe extinction eminent\" like. Chris Tucker, however, brings himself to another level, as a comic relief to a movie that was already not exactly a drama, jumping up to the clouds in all his fabulous \"Greeness\" and leaving the audience thinking what kind of alien was picked to act Ruby Rhod quirky character. Without a darker tone that some movies need to brand emotions in audiences, with laughable moments and action sequences, with amazing performances and detailing attention, fifth element truly transcends itself and the genre, supporting a classic hero love story until it is capable of becoming a classic.",

This movie is an action flick, set in the future. Sort of like \"Die hard 2020\".The storyline is interesting albeit a bit too loosely flushed out. We don't learn much about the priestly order of the protectors, or for that matter what this \"pure evil\" is all about and why it wants to destroy life (and then what?). Nevertheless, the plot is clear: Good against good-ole Evil, with a pinch of romance and a hefty dose of explosions. Don't expect too many twists either.Besson directs with professionalism, but without passion. Cinematography does not deserve any special mentioning too. Costumes, props and special effects are top-notch though and contribute greatly to the entertainment.Bruce Willis wonders in macho-funny land. His punch lines alternating with his punches. Milla Jovovich is physically exquisite and does a reasonably good job acting too. Holm and Oldman are solid, if restricted in their outfits. The various cameos (with the exception of Luke (look at my hair) Perry are well-put.Don't buy it, don't rent it even. Piggyback on somebody's passion for Bruce or Milla as appropriate and see it.

This third of Luc Besson's movies is truly a French comic book broken free of its panels -- not to be taken even remotely, momentarily seriously, it is a wonderful mixture of a comic book's childish simplicity and a movie's visual animation. Although quite violent, it is filled with sharp, witty dialogue and quick characterization, with many visual jokes and puns subtly slipped in for additional humor (the cigarette, for example, that's 75% filter). Bruce Willis's casting as the beaten down Corbin Dallas is obvious, but perfect. Gary Oldman deliciously overplays the wickedly evil Zorg, Milla Jovovitch wonderfully bounces from vulnerable to superwarrior, and the rest of the casting is equally inspired, straight down to \"Tiny\" Lister as The President. The \"Mobius\" inspired cityscapes and visual elements fit perfectly into the comic-book nature of the movie.No question, it *does* suffer on the small screen -- try to catch it in wide screen on a large Home Theatre system if you cannot see it at a real theatre. This movie needs to be \"big\" to be truly appreciated.The world has lost its Kubrick, but it's found an obvious successor.",

            "content": "Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg. Luc Besson deserves a medal for that name. Take the two most beautiful names from a language priding itself on elegance and add the ugliest one-syllable name ever concocted. Monty Python would have loved using it. It would have been as classic \"Mr. Smoke-too-much,\" and \"Sir Robin the Cowardly.\" An ingenious name does not make a movie by itself, but this one sums up Besson's brilliance. His world 250 years in the future has enough creativity for ten movies, and nothing is too absurd to occur in it.In the year 2263, Earth is the home of The Federated Territories, which is much like the Federation in Star Trek. People now live hundreds of feet above the surface. New York's flying cars still adhere to organized paths, but traffic moves in several ascending layers. Most people live in apartments where the bed retracts into the wall and they can have a restaurant come directly to their window. They cleanse their bodies by lowering the refrigerator, stepping atop it, and raising themselves into the shower. Some people prefer to use auto wash. When the police come into your building, you must place your hands into yellow circles on the wall, unless you are auto-washing, of course.Besson's vision of the future is more unique, creative and colorful than anything else to enter the cinemas save George Lucas' most recent episodes in a galaxy far, far away. Alas, the people live in dangerous times. Every 5,000 years, a black hole opens and a creature of pure evil enters our universe. Technically, it should be a white hole that sends it our way. In any case, if this evil reaches Earth before the Fifth Element activates the weapon against it, all life will be destroyed.To the rescue ride the Mondoshawans. They possess the four elemental stones and Leeloo (Milla Jovovich), the Fifth Element, but evil has an ally this time. Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg (Gary Oldman) has sided with the evil being, although what he stands to gain is a mystery. He uses the unwitting Mangalores as his allies, and it is them who ambush the Mondoshawan craft as it approaches Earth. However, Leeloo anticipated difficulty. With the help of Korben Dallas (Bruce Willis) and Priest Vito Cornelius (Ian Holm), she embarks for a distant rendezvous where the fate of every living being depends on the outcome.Bruce Willis plays a friendlier, less abrasive, more stable hero than is his norm. Willis built his considerable fame playing everyman heroes, and he still carries that spirit with him as Dallas. He projects sadness far more effectively and believably than he does in \"Die Hard with a Vengeance,\" and does so by muting his acting. Tommy Lister and Brion James play their roles as president and military leader with panache, and Holm meets all expectations as Priest Cornelius.The highest praise, however, belongs to Jovovich. She is able to do what few actors dare dream, namely create her own accent. While Leeloo has unfathomable strength and mind-blowing physicals skills, bullets still hurt and she is vulnerable in a world that bombards her senses in ways she never could have imagined. Jovovich has fun with Leeloo learning new words. She has the exuberance of an exploring child and emotes flawlessly in a language nobody in the audience understands. Plus, she can shed tears as well as anybody. There is no weak moment in her performance.Despite the fantastic name and distinctive appearance, Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg does not end the day among the classic villains. The shortcomings are not because Oldman acts poorly. They come from the way he and Besson created the character. Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel is not imposing or diabolical. Oldman elicits some laughs, which is a strong emphasis of the movie. However, he talks so strangely that many of Zorg's lines are difficult to understand.The action is awesome. Besson peppers it with reminders that none of it should be taken seriously. Many of Leeloo's fighting moves are purely comical and Dallas' winning attack in the climatic battle is purely for laughs. At one point he is no more than eight feet from three Mangalores and they all miss him with their fully automatic weapons. Despite its goofiness, the action quality is top notch.The best scene is a comedy-of-errors routine in Dallas' apartment. He must deal with multiple groups of people without everybody else knowing. He makes use of every gadget he can before, of course, the police arrive. It is a scene reminiscent of the old time comedies starring the likes of Abbott and Costello or Laurel and Hardy. In a way, it epitomizes what Besson's movie is all about, and that is pure fun.",

            "content": "Luc Besson's The Fifth Element is what you get when you give a massive budget to a director who has an otherworldly flair for imagination and a creative pulse that doesn't subside for one single second. It's one of the best sci fi films ever made, a pure intergalactic rush of absurdist qualities anchored by a solid blueprint that's both akin to and far removed from countless space movies out there. The surprise, and what works so well, comes from Besson and his team crafting a warped and almost Dr. Seussical world that dabbles in cartoonish territory, boggles the eyes endlessly and continually assures you that anything goes in terms of style and tone. It's an all timer for me, a blast of zany ideas, lovable characters (even the villains are teddy bears to me), a celebration of off the cuff production design and a goddamn certified barrel of fun. Most who read this will know the plot inside out and up and down, but we all know how much I love babbling on about actors and events, so bear with moi. There's an adorable prologue (\"Aziz, light!!!!\") In which an alien race called the Mondosheewans arrive on earth to remove a sacred and very powerful item from an Egyptian pyramid. They resemble shambling steam punk Volkswagen beetles, and are a force of good. This takes place in the 1800's, and before you can say Luke Perry, we've flashed forward to a dazzling futuristic New York City where the events that came before come full circle. Self depracating cabbie Corben Dallas (Bruce Willis) has a day of unending bad luck, until a gorgeous humanoid being named Leeloo (Milla Jovovich was my first cinematic crush in this role \u2661) literally falls into his lap, or rather, crashes through the roof of his cab and incites a high speed chase in hover cars, a fantastic sequence, I might add. It turns out this slender, orange deadlocked babe is the human manifestation of the coveted artifact that the Mondosheewans took into their possession. Willis and Jovovich have an immediate exasperated chemistry that practically leaps off the screen as giddily as your heart does whenever they're seen together. They're one of the cutest couples in history, and soon embark on a wild adventure to prevent mass destruction at the hands of a giant ball of pure evil that threatens earth (and no I didn't make that up). Also threatening them is Jean Baptiste Emanuel Zorg (wish that was my name), played by Gary Oldman in a preening, gaudy display of theatrical evil that must be seen to be believed. Zorg is an arrogent megalomaniac who basically runs the city, out to find the ancient stones that are the key to stopping that malevolent force that hangs out just outside of earth's atmosphere. This is the only film that can claim it has a scene where pure evil itself calls up Gary Oldman on the phone for a chat, which has to be some kind of achievement. There's a gaggle of incredible actors running around as well, including Bilbo Ba-, I mean Ian Holm as Father Cornelius, a priest of an ancient order sworn to protect Leeloo, the president of the united states (Tiny Lister, once again I'm not making this up), a hapless general (John Neville), a tweaked out petty thief (Mathieu Kassovitz in a scene of pure WTF), Brion James, Lee Evans, and Chris Tucker. Oh good lord Chris Tucker. I don't know how the guy has the energy, but he keeps it in mania mode as Ruby Rod, a flagrantly horny loudmouth prima donna radio DJ that tags along with Corben for a few gunfights and explosions and shrieks like a banshee all the while. Willis has never been as amiable as he is here, it's as if John McClane wandered into an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000 and decided to have some fun. Truly a great protagonist. You will fall deeply in love with Milla as Leeloo. Her lithe physicality, unearthly dialect that she actually learned in full for the film, striking naivete and burgeoning compassion all make her one of the most unique and mesmerizing heroines to ever exist in a film. Oldman mugs, chews scenery like a bulldog, prances about like he's in a grade school play, and is a sheer diabolical delight. The scene where he demonstrates the 'swiss army gun' for his dimwitted extraterrestrial cohorts is time capsule worthy, as is the entire film. Besson directs and stages his world with a reckless abandon that plays like a watercolor painting of pure expression. If there's an idea someone had, it ended up in this film no matter how outlandish and random it is. That's the kind of carefree artistic qualities that all movies should have; a willingness to be silly, to be crazy, to step outside the box and then trample on it whilst hurling confetti all about the place. This film is a shining example of that, and stands out as not only one of my favourite films of all time, but one of the best ever made. Big BADABOOM.",

Jonovich is certainly in top shape in this film and her character is fascinating as well, especially during the first act.

Admittedly, it doesn't put much science in science fiction, but it's a feast for the senses. Since \u0091Flash Gordon' in 1980, SF movies had lost their na\u00efve charm. `The Fifth Element' was basically the only big budget SF movie of the 90s that was pure straight-ahead fun. It was painful to watch for example `The Phantom Menace' trying to be funny by introducing a character with a silly squeaky voice. And on the other hand, it was equally hard to watch `Stargate' trying to be dead serious. Luc Besson had the concept for `The Fifth Element' in his teenage days already, and it shows. The movie offers fantastically designed colourful worlds and a whole menagerie of comic strip people with zero common sense, but not worrying at all. The villain wants to destroy the planet he lives on, just for the sake of being as evil as possible \u0096 other reviewers who complained that this is a screenplay mistake and not making sense didn't notice how that's poking fun at Bondish supervillains who point atomic rockets against Earth all the time. Milla Jovovich as Leeloo, the Fifth Element, is on a mission to save Earth, but already blown into pieces before she can say hello. Name any other movie where that happens. She is reconstructed after a piece of her corpse with the necessary genetic information was found. She escapes out of her glass tube to save life on earth (funny enough, French actress Mathilda May escaped from just the same kind of glass tube in \u0091Lifeforce' to destroy life on earth!). And it's not easy to look good in white bandages, with your hair tainted orange. I wouldn't want to try! Bruce Willis fits in well, creating his own cartoon image based on the `Die Hard' trilogy and the taxi driver from `Heavy Metal'. I'll never understand why there's quite a lot of people around who dislike this movie \u0096 I think it's exceptional in every way!

This movie is your basic save the world/love story. This movie has tons of action, some comedy, and great visuals. I am a Bruce Willis fan and he does not disappoint in this. Milla Jovovich is great in this movie. For someone who does not have much dialog, you always feel like she is always communicating with you. Is their a better bad guy than Gary Oldman? Maybe Walken, but Oldman makes a case for himself in this film. Who is Luc Besson? I never heard of him before until I watched this movie. After this I researched him a little and found that he has many other good films that I have checked out since. I'm not a fan of fantasy movies, but this is more than just fantasy. A classic tale of good versus evil. This movie is groundbreaking and is a movie you can pop in your DVD player and watch any time. Two thumbs up, way up!",

            "content": "In sci-fi, we find many examples of films with the courage to be original in their concepts and to have an auteur stamp from the filmmakers who directed them. It was like that with Blade Runner; Ghost in the Shell; Matrix; The Planet of the Apes; City of shadows; films that took hold of the genre's rich concepts and explored it in ways that the general public perhaps did not expect, and enjoyed the profit of being recognized today by legions of fans, even if it took some critics to swallow their egos and accept something new and original.A film like that could easily come from a director with a solidly renowned name like Luc Besson. Recognized today by many for being perhaps the greatest French director of the action genre, but who never stuck to just that genre and has always shown himself to be someone creative in the use of escapist cinematographic language, but with a refined European polish as his signature. Author. If today, Besson is ahead of forgettable films like Taken 3, Colombian and The Transporter 3, we see in \"The Fifth Element\" a perfect reminder of his past promising phase, a reminder of how highly original and creative the director could be in its script conception and creation of a universe of its own with its own rich mythology, and without any fear of having its somewhat bizarre quirks.When an alien ship of the peaceful people of the Mondoshawans is attacked, a mysterious artifact is used to reconstruct a humanoid woman, \"Leeloo\" (Milla Jovovich), who is described as the \"perfect being\". Afraid of her unknown captors, she escapes the compound and finds herself with Korben Dallas (Bruce Willis), a divorced taxi driver and former major in the special forces. That later discovers that Leloo is a living weapon known as the Fifth Element, a being capable of uniting the four elements into a divine light capable of defeating the great evil, a planet in the form of fire that threatens to destroy the entire universe.Perhaps an almost fantasy plot with epic ambitions worthy of a true science fiction film. No wonder its level of detail, which reflects the expansive futuristic utopian universe that forms this world, carries with it immense originality. Besson had already envisioned Fifth Element since his adolescence as a dreamy young filmmaker, and he shows on screen the fulfillment of a dream actually coming true. And yet it is remarkable to see how he manages to conceive in the main narrative certain bizarre and interesting traits of familiarity with great films of the genre such as 2001 - A Space Odyssey itself, with regard to the scientific and ethical questioning of human creation present in its brief between lines of the plot that deals with the origins of the creation and the search of the salvation of the galactic universe when we leave in the dazzling and exciting journey of Dallas to save its new beloved one and the whole universe.Furthermore, the screenplay by Besson (who wrote it at age 16) and by Robert Mark Kamen (from Relentless Quest) is a lesson in daring and creative cinema. Not only does he walk the threshold of utopia and cynicism, he also adds visionary elements. With familiar concepts similar in a way to Ridley Scott's own Blade Runner, in what refers mainly to the creation of a utopian future that reflects multi-urbanization in its immense megalopolis, and the intense dependence on technology. Concepts that are always presented in a very subtle way in the characterization of the city and the characters' environments, such as the narrow cubicle in which Dallas lives, or the countless technological devices that Gary Oldman's villain Zorg has in his office, for no apparent reason.The production is accurate in everything that composes it, without wasting time with so much explanatory exposition and knowing how to balance everything in an always fluid and perfect rhythm. And still bring with it this humorous and bizarre tone so gaudy that, surprisingly, it never crosses the line of silly caricature, but instead proves to be constantly funny and highly entertaining filled with a cast that is nothing less than highly charismatic where clearly everyone is having fun, counting with an always great Iam Holm with his unshakable faith and seriousness, convincing yet as golden comic relief. We still have Chris Tucker as the famous presenter who just screams for help when chaos sets in. But he manages to get some good laughs too. And having Gary Oldman as the villain is just an invitation to be someone memorable and intimidating, and that's exactly what you get here.Since \"Die Hard\" Bruce Willis has shown that he knows how to mix action with comedy at the right moments, and this role fit him like a glove. The great chemistry between him and Milla Jovovich makes the relationship between the two protagonists delightful to follow. The actress, by the way, is the best thing about the film. His Leeloo is abundantly captivating and shows an innocence, before the world in which it was played, that convinces and conquers the spectators. Besson invented a language for the Leeloo race and Jovovich quickly learned it. To practice, they wrote each other letters in the language and had entire conversations in the new language. This resulted in an enriching element to the scene where Leeloo and Korben meet for the first time, Willis didn't know what he was hearing, so his reactions were improvised. Not to mention the stunning beauty of the then young actress, who more than anyone could embody the person created to be \"perfect\" in every way. Jovovich mesmerizes the entire audience from the moment she appears on screen.The plot is staged as a bizarre action thriller, which ironically has almost no action so to speak. There's a good, and inventive, initial chase between buildings, and the big gunfight in the opera complete with an iconic brief Kung Fu fight interspersed with an extremely entertaining pop sonnet. This is Besson's irony, he rarely delivers action scenes in his films, but when he does, he manages to be a spectacle. Few are the directors who manage to achieve a visual refinement as rich and conceptual as he is. Even in his weakest films, the visuals are always a big standout apart from everything else.Cinematographer Thierry Arbogast gives the film a scenic format worthy of the best epics ever made. Where every mill metric space of scenery, big or small, has this 70mm level immersion capable of bringing the viewer into the film. It's not even a Lusophone need to want to captivate or impress, just something that is part of the director's visual style in wanting to immerse his audience into the universe he creates. Comics artists Moebius and Jean-Claude M\u00e9zi\u00e8res (artist of the \"Valerian\" comic, also adapted by Besson for the cinema) worked on the production design of the film and they were worth every penny. The feature is an explosion of colors, all well exalted by the director, who insisted that much of the story took place during the day, delivering a clearer, happier, eccentric, caricatured and even magical look.The cartoonish air is in the characters themselves, from the way they were conceived to their costumes (signed by Jean Paul Gaultier), which fit organically with the film's production design. The actors embody eccentric people and create a great atmosphere for comedy, which is enhanced by the courage of the script to embrace its playful proposal without the slightest hesitation, resulting in one of the funniest features of the 90s. Scene in which one character tells another that he has 20 seconds of his attention, and the other starts talking for exactly this period.The Fifth Element, which seems a far cry from all of Besson's filmography, is the one that punctuates and creates a milestone in his career. Without expecting more from someone who developed this story during his adolescence, there are numerous holes in the script, a questionable timeline and an antagonist that sometimes does not seem to make sense to exist in the plot. However, the film is unbeatable for involving the viewer both in its visual madness and in its fast pace of editing that compensates for the flaws and makes the experience a unique fun. \"The Fifth Element\" is easily one of the funniest works of 1990s cinema. A film that reminds us of a good time when we could see original, creative, and extraordinarily entertaining films with that admirable European polish, realizing a rich entertainment so cleverly conceived and sorely lacking in today's mundane world.",

Of course, there were some plot holes and things that could've been left out the final cut, but it was just too good to let little things get out of the way. This movie still is a great topic of conversation between friends and myself.The special effects were something to look at. Dozens of flying cars zooming by in traffic hell, and when Willis dives through them it's just spectacular. It was the best mid-air car chase I'd ever seen, and the scene where Leeloo is reconstructed from just DNA was an excellent way to introduce a main character.And for the record, for all those people who think Chris Tucker's character (Ruby Rode) was gay, I want to say that he wasn't. I would guess that Besson was thinking of how so many things would change in 3 hundred years. Just think now. There were no computers in the 1800's. Hell, there wasn't even a telephone (I don't think, but if there was it wasn't touch-tone).The haircuts were weird. So were the clothes. So were the rooms inside the apartments. But this came from the mind of a 13 year-old French boy in boarding school and revised into a movie. Besson's got a good and creative imagination. And if he is really helming the Tomb Raider movie, I'm sure it'll just add to the list.",

But this juicy eye candy can not substitute for a decent plot!Bruce Willis plays a rundown cabbie in 23rd century New York who's recruited by the government's top brass to--all together boys and girls... TO SAVE THE WORLD!!! No Spit! The guy from \"Blade\" uttered those exact words, yes they were that cheesy with the script! And of course he's a natural born war hero with a dozen medals/trophies and whatnot. But one must ask, \"What is this ultimate force which threatens to destroy the \"entire universe\"? Is it an advanced alien species bent on conquest? Nope. Is it some unique space virus? Sorry, try again. But rather a (get this) a 1,200 mi diameter fireball which is headed for Earth (uh-huh).\nC'mon, that's absurd! Even acting Prez \"Tiny\" Lister Jr. rolled his eyes while quoting the exact same line--as if to say, \"OhmyGodIcan'tbelieveI'msayingthis!\" I mean my 9 year old cousin could've come up with a better plot device than that! Never mind the gaping plot hole of how destroying the Earth will in-turn destroy the entire universe(?) But hey, take it or leave it!The plot got a little silly in the third act with a \"Die Hard\" style shoot-out (bet ya $50 bucks this was Willis' ideal) on the Carnival Cruise between Willis, the annoying Ruby Rob (Chris Tucker) and Dogmen bad guys. Actually Rob was rather tolerable at first, but after a while you were really ready for someone to vaporize him! Then all of a sudden, everyone gets dead serious in the final act when the fireball decides it's time to slam into Earth and wipe-out all these annoying characters (you can pretty much figure out the ending yourself).Rating: 5Other Nitpicks:1.) Eventhough the leader of the alien race (forgot their name) accidentally gets entombed at the beginning of the film, he (or his remains) are nowhere to be found when Willis and Co. return later on.2.) Minutes seem to snail by in the temple on \"Earth\" when Willis and Co. are fiddling around, yet the view from space would suggest collision between the fireball and \"Earth\" are imminent.3.) Ok, which production crew member donated the chocolate syrup leftover from their sundae to pour over Gary Oldman's forehead?",

            "content": "Whilst this movie is fun and has a nostalgic value, I hadn't realize how much of its story is left unexplained for us and thus doesn't make much sense after rewatching it now as a grown adult.As a serious movie (since it is actually one), it does pose a lot of questions that need answering. Who is the Great Evil? Does Zorg work for himself or Mr Shadow? And is Mr Shadow an Agnot? Why do they exactly want the stones? What exactly are the stones? Oh, and what are the Mondoshawans? Was the space battle scene 300 years after the Egypt event Korben's \"nightmare\" (as he said)? Lots of things were unexplained and left me perplexed. The film should've given us a lot of explanation on the background of the story.My other complaint is Bruce Willis. He was just being Bruce Willis, really. I also thought he was too old to be Leelu's love interest. They seemed like a father and daughter to me. Luke Perry, who appeared in the film's opening, would have been a far more age-appropriate (and much more attractive, might I add) Korben Dallas. But then again, Luc Beeson has a strange fascination with older men being into younger, adolescent looking females, which I find rather peculiar. But I digress.I would've preferred if Korben Dallas wasn't a typical macho male, action figure who was once part of the military. Just how many of those do we need in action movies? That was all been there, done that, and unoriginal. How about just a regular man with a normal job? He was a taxi driver after all. Why did he need to have a military past?Even though not much of its background story is explained, I did forgive it and enjoyed a lot of scenes until Fhloston Paradise. Whilst Chris Tucker is really funny, I thought he was inappropriate and unfitting in this. There was no point of zany comedy in a serious and somewhat philosophical film. The \"give me the cash\" guy at the beginning of the film was extremely cringeworthy, although he only appeared for like 1 minute. But it wasn't just comedy. The shootout fest at the end on the ship made the film lose its nice sci-fi aura that it had earlier, and rather felt like Die Hard.Gary Oldman, Ian Holm and Milla Jovovich made this film very watchable thanks to their good performance and their likable characters as well. The score by Eric Serra was mesmerizing and very sentimental to me. The film, in a nutshell, may be entertaining, but it is a bit too vague when it comes to its plot, in addition to being formulaic (\"let's save the world\") and inconsistent (it doesn't know whether it wants to be a philosophical science fiction or a mindless action shooter film).",

Ever.Ma\u00efwenn Le Besco, Gary Oldman and Ian Holm also deliver solid supporting performances.I won't say much about the plot. It's passable, but that's not really where the fun is. It's in the characters, the acting and the action, from Korben Dallas to Leeloo to Ruby Rhod. Get yourself a \"Mooltipass,\" because The Fifth Element is considerable fun.",

Luc Besson had a story with a central theme in it (the emotional progress of Korben Dallas, and how the fate of the world hinges on it), but totally failed to put enough into the film to fill that theme out. The climax of the film is greatly deflated because of this.The rest of it is marvelous fun, with excellent acting from all the major characters, uniquely entertaining side characterizations, a well filled-out future society, and an understandable and involving storyline. Had Mr Besson properly set up the climactic scene, it would have been an outstanding five star winner, instead of the three and a half star light watching that it is.",

            "content": "When a gargantuan space ball of pure evil is 48 hours away from eradicating the Earth and all who dwell upon it, there is only one way to stop it is by finding a being that is pure goodness. Not diluted 14% like Tom Cruise, not 25% pure like orange juice, not even 78% like Taylor Swift.100%.The only problem is that only a couple know that the orange haired, wide eyed, band-aid wearing gibberish speaker is the sought after pure being \u2013 and initially the space cab driver Major Korben Dallas (Bruce Willis) whose cab she crash landed into in this futuristic future \u2013 isn't one of them.Once it becomes evident though that the aforementioned gibberish speaking being Leeloo (Milla Jovovich) is the titular 5th Element everyone wants to get their hands on her.On the side of good is Priest Cornelius (Ian Holm) charged with mentoring and teaching Leeloo the ropes so that she is ready when the alien force arrive to escort her to safety, unfortunately the aliens are killed minutes before they arrive\u0085 which doesn't help.On the bad side is Zorg (Gary Oldman), a big business CEO whose business develops and sells weapons, often to other naughty guys. Zorg is concerned that if good succeeds in wiping out evil his business might suffer, (which makes sense if you think about it).The action moves to a Hawaii themed holiday ship in deep space, where a handover of special stones representing the other 4 elements is due to take place.Everyone wants to get their hands on the stones and Leeloo, and Dallas is stuck in the middle of it all.All the while Leeloo \u2013 who was only \"born\" hours previously when regenerated from damaged tissue \u2013 is learning at an incredible rate about humanity and what she has inadvertently got herself into.Everyone jostles for position and plans their attacks before the finale turns into a Bruce Willis special bullet-space-opera \u2013 only with odd looking monsters instead of terrorists of cowboys.Every movie nowadays is marketed either as \"Nothing you've ever seen before\" or \"Exactly like almost everything you've seen before\". Generally only the latter is accurate, only in most cases it should say the same\u0085 only worse.So while The Fifth Element is indeed just another sci-fi flick with big names and shootouts on alien worlds, it is perhaps the most original looking big budget film for a long while.The future New York (I think) looks especially cool, as we all expect traffic in the future is airborne and cruises around on multiple levels. Space is at a premium and the layout of Dallas' apartment is especially well appointed and designed.In fact we are not merely told things are futuristic we are shown, everything on screen looks similar but quite different to the versions currently available, the fashion is pretty insane but oddly practical and the backdrops and sets bright and colourful.Aside from the headline names the cast is filled with non-actors, models and pretty people mainly, and weed-loving musical headcase Tricky has a small role as Zorg's main henchman.Chris Tucker steals the second half of the film as chipmunk voiced radio DJ Ruby Rhod, a hyperactive, superficial vacuous motormouth who rocks ridiculous outfits and hairstyles and will not shut up from the moment his show starts to well after it ends. He is followed by toadying Yes-Men and for some reason is universally adored.None of this should work, and even if some did there is no way it should result in a great film \u2013 everything is just too different, too off-kilter, too Non-Hollywood to be successful.This film is more out there and ambitious than any big budget film I can remember, but somehow it all works.The first half is merely eye catching and amusing and basically ends with one and all arriving on the space resort ship.The second half starts with the introduction of Ruby and builds gradually until a concert performance by a giant blue alien creature. Now the performance is opera but don't let that fool you it's actually quite cool and really effective, and allows pause for breath before Dallas goes bang-bang, leading to an effective final 20 minutes as things start moving even more rapidly and the huge ball of evil looms ever closer.The Fifth Element doesn't get the credit that it deserves today, I'm not sure why but can only assume that it is viewed as a non-American made kiddie space film. And while Luc Besson, Bruce Willis and co don't take anything too seriously here The Fifth Element is an enormously entertaining, amazingly eye-catching and truly original flick that holds up even 15 odd years since it's release.Final Rating \u2013 9 / 10. Jovovich is good, Oldman suitably hammy and Willis wink-winks it up, but the triumph of The Fifth Element is the audacity of the visuals and effectiveness of the set pieces. This is a movie unlike anything you've seen, for once that isn't a bad thing.",

The sci fi action was done quite well in many scenes too. Ian Holm, Gary Oldman, Tommy Lister Jr., Lee Evans, and Brion James were all noteworthy cast members as well, as they are in everything.

The Ruby Rod character was so outrageous as to be a perfect foil for Corbin's Gary Cooperisms (\"yep\", \"nope\", \"maybe\").

I'd find myself saying \"Wait, what happened to...\" or \"Where did that come from?\" I guess, since this is sci-fi, we're just supposed to laugh and fill in the gaps ourselves, but I found it rather annoying. Speaking of annoying, I don't even need to elaborate on the character of Ruby Rhod, who--by the way--simply walks out of the pyramid at the end of the movie, presumably to a slow, fiery death (there I go filling in the gaps on my own).I'm not a big fan of science fiction anyway, but there are some sci-fi's that I like.

The Frenchman succeeds in bringing a very European look in to a major Hollywood movie (visually, the film most resembles a certain breed of European comic book) and for that alone deserves considerable credit. The effects, production and costume design all have been thought through with considerable care and make a coherent and compelling world even if, individually, they don't always work. The story, concerning the embodiment of love being required to save the universe, is deeply silly, aiming for profundity and missing by a fair margin but that's beside the point. The ride is entertaining and it's worth arguing that no female actor has ever done better as an action hero than Mila Jovovich. Kathleen Turner bombed in V.I. Warshawski (such a comprehensive disaster that, to be fair, that she never stood a chance) and the much more physically appropriate Geena Davis failed repeatedly with scripts of varying quality. The multilingual and seriously smart Jovovich has proved to have a startling range. She can do a complex historical character in \"The Messenger\", a comic villain in \"Zoolander\" and then beat the bejeezus out of all-comers in something like this. Leeloo is the only role in the film that asks much of any of the actors (Gary Oldman, as usual, gives enormously more than he is asked) and Jovovich really responds pulling off some very difficult scenes. Accepted on its own terms and \"The Fifth Element\" is a unique experience.",

I watched it only because it was a slow Sunday night on TV, and the small screen and commercial breaks didn't help. But it has a cheeky charm, plenty of action, villainous villains (though the biggest villain is an unseen force) flamboyant sets (Brooklyn circa 2300 may be stolen from Fritz Lang's `Metropolis' but is nonetheless very impressive.) You can empathise with the heroine, reconstructed from a few cells, when she sees the city for the first time.I won't go into the logical inconsistencies in the plot; this is not a movie with a plot that bears much analysis. The future presented is more of the same, but worse, so that in 2300 people will still be going to Las Vegas style resorts, except that they will be in outer space. This does make you think why we bothered with space flight at all. Essentially this is a French film but with two unusual factors; a big Hollywood star, Bruce Willis, and a fairly big budget, $US90 million. (The film more than recovered its costs but did better in non-US markets). Its also a very personal film with Luc Bresson both directing and writing, and casting Mrs Bresson , the gorgeous Milla Jovovich, as the heroine (she does fit the bill nicely, dyed red hair and all).It is possible to trace almost every scene back to some earlier film or series. Apart from `Metropolis' there's the Egyptian scenes with John Bluthal and Luke Perry in the style of `Indiana Jones', the death star from `Star Wars', the casino battle with overtones of `Casino Royale', the snogging in the escape capsule reminiscent of James Bond \u0096 you name it, Bresson has taken it from somewhere. Not a great deal of acting is required in these circumstances, though Ian Holm makes the most of his opportunities as Vito the priest. Chris Tucker is appallingly over the top as DJ Ruby Rhod and I fervently hoped one of the minor monsters would blast him, but to no avail. Gary Oldman put in a ho-hum performance as the evil entrepreneur (called `Zorg' for heaven's sake), but was labouring under the handicap of being a villain without a motive. Why would he want the Earth to be blown up? Had he insured it with some Intergalactic Lloyds?This kind of cultural `borrowing' is quite common in French movies \u0096 all those French film noir films with Hollywood ancestry for example -  but usually the French contrive to put their own stamp on the finished product. This film is such a jumble, and so vague in its intentions it is impossible to regard it as more than a pastiche, though done with a certain amount of sly humour and plenty of resources. I think Gaumont were very lucky to get their money back.",

'The Fifth Element' is truly an excellent film, or rather, a terrific combination of action and comedy...just like the perfect combination of stir-fry and beef. So tasty, yet so simple.Truly an exquisite film, 'The Fifth Element' takes place 300 years from 1914, when ancient inscriptions from a large Egyptian tomb were discovered. Basically, there are five elements which protect 'life' from all sources of evil. Put simply, it is the most powerful energy force in the universe. Made from fire, earth, wind and water, they all suside from the fifth element (hence the title of the film), which takes form of a powerful warrior. 300 years later, the four sources are stolen and it is up to an unlikely candidate (Bruce Willis) to take up the job of saving the world from a powerful menace.Despite the large array of talented cast members (Bruce Willis, Mila Jovovich, etc), Chris Tucker (acting as the funny Ruby Rohd) clearly outshines the rest of the cast...performance, comedy, everything. In fact, his performance in this film is clearly the best he's ever given! Amazing! I highly recommend those craving for the unusual mix of sci-fi/action and comedy, 'The Fifth Element' is a definate \"must see\".

            "content": "First things first: the only reason I am writing this review is because of the overwhelming amount of high ratings given this film, and its 7.0 average star rating.  Given this information I have no choice but to assume the people seeing this film have never seen any science fiction, comedy, or in fact any movie of any weight at all ever in their life.  Lets address the issues:Plot: Abysmal The plot of this movie is something like what you wrote in 5th grade for the composition part of the day, complete with that cool gun you always wanted. I read a review describing it as too complicated; that's a bit like saying a lego is complicated... No, this movie's 'plot' is simple, derivative, juvenile and eventually unnecessary.  Whomever commented that it is a little better than Dark City, I urge you to go soak your head and maybe watch the 5th Element sober this time.Acting: Laughable Bruce Willis plays himself.  Beautiful Milla Jovovich speaks gibberish...how hard is that? Gary Oldman terribly directed, it looks like it physically pains him to say each line with that ridiculous accent. Chris Tucker is obnoxious and unnecessary.  Everyone else is as well, I suppose.Special effects/style: They blew it If I were to give this movie any credit, it would be in this category--there was a monumental effort to get me to like this film by the director, costumer, cinematographer, etc etc, but none of them could do their job well.  I was sad to see this movie so badly directed after seeing Leon (The Professional in the USA), which is on my top 10.  The costumes were not over the top, they were ridiculous, we'll leave it at that.  Everything in the movie was exaggerated to the point of absurdity.  Now I'm a fan of action, SF, comedy, and everything this film tries to be, and I can't think of one film that has done ANYTHING as badly as any given part of this movie.  The special effects were a mixed bag--the city was decent, but not visionary as some of you have put it, just fun for a moment, which was soon lost.  In the first scene, I actually thought the animatronic alien things were a joke until they turned out to be an 'important' part of the movie's 'plot.' When this was made clear to me I nearly died laughing.  For those of you who haven't seen it, you'll know what I mean when you do.  There's no real style to the cinematography, directing, or editing; it was all done on the fly, I think, resulting in some shabby and excessive shots.Overall: just too bad to even consider I realize that some of you will say this movie doesn't take itself seriously, but I disagree; no 16-year old kid writes something like this to be a self-parody, not even Luc Besson.  Some will say it's just mindless fun.  Mindless yes, fun.....well, the gags weren't funny, the action was melodramatic, hideously overdone, and gimmicky all over.  That cool gun? It plays no part in the movie at all, and it takes up about 5 min of screen time.  Same for Christ Tucker's character.Bottom line: If the producers of this movie intended it to be this bad, I sincerely applaud them, because they succeeded marvelously in creating such an abominally bad piece of cinema (even popcorn cinema) that I actually thought it was made to be a serious hollywood movie.  The ONLY reasons to rent this are 1:an overdone version of the do's and don'ts of movies, minus the don'ts.  see it if you want to make movies--this isn't what you want to do. And 2:Milla Jovovich does the only good job at anything in this movie, being beautiful...and she doesn't even have to try.  Thus concludes the panning.And for all of you who sincerely enjoyed this movie..... never mind.",

I particularly liked Bruce Willis and Milla Jovovich. Chris Tucker's character was unbelievably funny, and for those people who were annoyed by how loud and whiny he was, well, that's why so many people thought he was funny. He was such an obvious parody of Prince(wussy, worshiped by ladies) that viewers couldn't help cracking up. The special effects were great, and I can't believe it didn't get an Oscar for the visual effects. I loved the exciting flying-car chase. However, my favorite part of the film would have to be the awesome fight scene between Leeloo and the ugly Mangalore aliens. This was filmed perfectly, and is one of the best movie fight scenes ever!Still, the rest of the movie is also really good, and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys action or sci-fi.",

            "content": "While watching The Fifth Element, Europe's latest attempt to make Hollywood style films, one cannot help but infer that Bruce Willis knows that this film is a giant cornball, much like the ball of evil that Father Vito Cornelius deems, \"Absolute Eeevil.\" His acting combines a kind- of smug knowledge with a down-to-earth attitude in a way that makes his scenes watch able. That's about as enjoyable in Luc Besson's sci-fi epic gets. The film starts off in 1910, where a few archaeologists are reading a hieroglyph that detail the ultimate weapon against evil: a fifth element. Suddenly, a group of mechanical beings known as the Monascheiwans (try saying that five times fast) come to Egypt and take the fifth element, along with some four stones that somehow represent the other elements, in order to ensure their continued existence. Besson doesn't bother to explain how this weapon works or even what makes the stones so special. He simply whisks us two hundred and fifty years in the future, where life as we know it is threatened by the arrival of Evil, in the form of a black ball flying through space. Only the fifth element can stop the Evil from extinguishing life, as it tries to do every five thousand years. It turns out, that The fifth element is a woman, played by Milla Jovovich as a clueless woman who speaks only a mysterious language and spends most of the film being carried by Bruce Willis' character, Korbin Dallas. This hardly explains exactly what the fifth element is, and why it assumes this form, but Besson isn't interested in explanations; perhaps because Besson knows it makes no sense. The fifth element is helped by ex-soldier, and current-cab-driver Korben Dallas. Dallas is going about his business when he picks up the fifth element in his cab and thus begins the overdone premise of the man who's forced into a situation that he's not supposed to be in, and who becomes a hero in such. Thus is the real influence of Die Hard. For The Fifth Element bars striking resemblance to Die Hard, with the exception that it takes place in the future, in space, and Bruce Willis fights off the bad guys without removing his shoes-oh and it doesn't take place during Christmas. Korbin Dallas is helped by a pop star, and notable queen, Ruby Rhod, played by Chris Tucker. It's hard to say whether Chris Tucker's high-pitched squeal and neurotic character is a result of his strange interpretation or a truly terrible performance. On the opposite end, Evil is being assisted by Mr. Zorg, played as a southern creep with a bad hair cut by Gary Oldman, who seeks to profit from the chaos that Evil will bring. He hires mercenaries, who look like humans with hogsheads, to do all the fighting. If you're having trouble following this, then movie will be no easier to understand. As if this wasn't enough to convince you that The Fifth Element isn't worth a bucket of warm spit, just pay attention to the acting. President Lindberg, played by one of the worst actors to ever appear in a major Hollywood production, Tommy Lister, recites his ridiculous lines with a staleness only found in week-old bread. I could go on and on detailing all the bad acting, but I do not wish to cause as much pain as the casting director does. The Fifth Element would work well as a comedy-that is-if it didn't have moments of great pain. In attempting to find the stones in order to activate the weapon against evil, Korbin Dallas ends up on an inter-galactic resort listening to a solo opera, sung by a blue woman with hoses attached to her head. Suddenly, the opera turns from classical music to disco. It is at this point that the film has reached its painful peak. The Fifth Element may not be the worst film ever made, but is sure in the running. If you've made the mistake of renting The Fifth Element, now would be a good time to find your remote's mute button, or better yet, the off button. F",

I think this is the best of those genres.\nTaking place two hundred years in the future (well, mostly) this film is a classic battle between good and evil with all levels of good and evil from supreme beings(generally non-human) to supreme idiots(generally, though not always, human) as the Bruce Willis character reluctantly joins a hapless band of intra-galactic do-gooders to save the universe from supreme evil. This is one instance in which getting the girl has life or death implications.  Unlike Blade Runner, for instance, this story is well assembled and unlike Star Wars, for instance, doesn't rely on computer effects.  I thought the international flavor of the casting lent an additional character to the script.My only problem with the film is that it is reported that Eric Serra, who scored and performed the film's music, hates doing this kind of work.  I don't know why because his sound track CD is certainly worth owning too.\nAziz, more light.",

The films all present naive concepts more in tune with style and flash rather than deeper substance.  My only real thought with The Fifth Element is: how many times did Besson watch Heavy Metal before making this?  So much material is obviously inspired from it that I just started rolling my eyes.  By the end, everything has abandoned the sci-fi genre and gone into the fantasyland that George Lucas reigns over as king...I am, of course, sarcastic in saying that.Truth to be told, neither Willis nor Jovovich are noteworthy in this film. Holm is wasted on a cracked-out priest that made me remember the glory days of Ash the android.  Oldman is an oddball this time, unlike his serious role in The Professional (Leon) and Chris Tucker is on the spot as the warp speed DJ.  Sometimes I was wondering when Denis Leary was going to come along and give the coup de-grace to the whole project with more lightning fast banter.Thankfully, Besson has Thierry Arbogast's help in creating some of the most diabolical visuals this side of Blade Runner.  Most of the CGI is too obvious and the makeup effects are terrible, not to mention the sound, but when looked upon as parody, this is a new Spaceballs.  You decide if that's good or bad.Overall, Star Wars meets Transformers meets North by Northwest meets Hard-Boiled.  You decide if it's good or not, I think it needed some enlightening ahead of time.  2.5 out of 5 stars.",

Towards the end of the film, this cross-cutting became too much of a nuisance to reaching the resolution of the film.  Also, I found the the third act of the film to be overly contrived.  The urgency of reaching Egypt was lost when Korben Dallas (Bruce Willis) told the President that he would call back in two hours, and, \"poof!\", he arrived in Egypt.Bresson overtly stated improperly the fifth element.  From a classical Greek standpoint, the four basic elements are earth, water, fire and wind, which Bresson used correctly.  However, for the Greeks, the fifth element was the \"heavens;\" all celestial bodies were composed of this uneartlhy element.",

(See my comment on Hart's War). So I knew going into the theater I would probably like it. I'm also a huge fan of Science Fiction, which gave me a second reason to expect to like it. What I wasn't prepared for was a movie that is so original that it defies classification. It crosses so many genre boundaries, it is truly in a class by itself! I'm not big on foreign films, as I have the same linguistic handicap as Korben Dallas (Willis). I only speak two languages, English and Bad English. I also consider subtitles to be usually a distraction. The only exception to that is when I'm watching a true masterpiece like Kurosawa's The Seven Samurai, or a war movie that has dialog in multiple languages to make it more realistic, like The Longest Day or Patton. I also find it hard not to laugh at dubbed movies where the mouth movements are totally out of sync with the dialog. End of digression. This movie is simply a wild ride from start to finish! Every character adds something to the unique flavor of it. When you add stunning visuals, fast pacing, great costume design, and a great soundtrack, it just works superbly on every level. Now back to the acting. Bruce Willis is the American master of delivering hilarious lines with total seriousness. I just can't say enough about Leeloo, (Milla Jovovich). She manages to be tough, vulnerable, childlike, and totally HOT, all at the same time! The same goes for Zorg, (Gary Oldman, or \"Scary Gary\", as the cast of Air Force One called him). There are very few actors in the world that are as good as a bad guy, and none better. He's at the top of his form here. BTW, did anyone else catch the irony of his given names? Jean-Baptiste, (John the Baptist), and Emmanuel, (one of the names of our Savior, Jesus Christ). Then there's the priest, Vito Cornelius, (Ian Holm), who not only serves as the movie's straight man, but even delivers some very funny lines of his own. I even liked the over the top performance of Ruby Rhod, (Chris Tucker). I thought the interplay between him and Korben Dallas was just hilarious! Including him screaming like a girl when Korben shot the floor all around him so the Mangalores wouldn't get him and the stones. I'm chuckling as I'm writing this! Last but most certainly not least, there's the Diva Plavalaguna, (Ma\u00efwenn Le Besco, speaking and Inva Mula-Tchako, singing). She was absolutely fantastic. I love so many movies that I have to get specific about the genre to name any favorites, but since this movie doesn't fit any single genre, it's my favorite genre crossing movie! 10/10",

Through action-packed fight scenes, a love-story that saves the world, and awkwardly entrancing villains, The Fifth Element builds a universe of destruction, mistrust, and the all-powerful male. It leaves space for depth, but creates a narrative with wonderful musical backing that is greatly enjoyable.The movie starts with an alien race, the Mondoshawans, arriving in ancient Egypt to collect 4 stones that power the only weapon capable of defeating an unspeakable evil that returns every 5,000 years. They will return when the time is right. Jump forward to the time of the attack, and the spaceship is returning to earth but is shot out of the sky. Only a hand is found that is reconstructed to create Leeloo, a humanoid whose DNA is \"perfect.\" She runs away and falls in love with Korben Dallas, our other main character, while they fight to find the four stones so that they can save the universe with the fifth element, love. Written by Luc Besson at the age of 16, The Fifth Element was released as a film when he was 38. The story line is supported by a great cast of characters including Bruce Willis as Korben Dallas, Milla Jovovich as Leeloo, and Chris Tucker as Ruby Rhod. Korben and Leeloo work wonderfully together as the leads, although Leeloo's helplessness as a perfect being shows her as being feminine to a fault, while Korben is overly masculine. She only shows strength in one fight scene between her and a group of Mangalores, an alien race hired to find the stones, at the end of which, she goes right back to being helpless and requiring the help of Korben. Chris Tucker shows a hyper effeminate male, whose only purpose is comedic relief while being over- sexualized and helpless. The main villain (with a face), Zorg, is played by Gary Oldman. He is a pleasure seeking sociopath bent on universal destruction, but he is comedic in his own right. The soundtrack, composed by \u00c9ric Serra builds up and adds depth to the film. The majority of the film has music in the background and this in no way takes away from it. The strongest moment, the \"Diva Dance Opera,\" was not composed by Serra, but combined with the dancing blue alien and the Leeloo's intense fight scene, it creates a perfect moment of music and film. Although it may not have created a soundtrack that I would purchase to listen to at home, for the film, it was ideal.Overall, The Fifth Element is a great blockbuster. Action-packed, with comedic and entrancing characters, not to mention great costumes, it sets itself up to be enjoyed. If you're looking for an enjoyable evening to sit back, laugh, and go to a different world, I'd recommend sitting down and watching this film.",

            "content": "Luc Besson created a wild futuristic universe two decades ago that was fun with a solid good vs. evil story. When a hidden weapon is found amidst the pyramids before the start of the World Wars, an alien race flies down to retrieve it and starts an order of priesthoods that would pass the knowledge down of a holy weapon to fight evil. In the very colorful future, Corbin Dallas (Bruce Willis) drives a taxi having given up his life as a fighter pilot. Absolute evil takes the form of a growing black ball that destroys military spaceships. As the priest, Father Vito Cornelius (Ian Holm) awaits of the fifth element with President Lindberg (Tommy Lister), Jean-Baptist Emanuel Zorg (Gary Oldman) sends shape-shifting aliens called Mangalores to shoot down the ship and retrieve the four elemental stones. The only survivor of the crash is recreated in a Neurolab into Leeloo (Milla Jovovich) and she breaks out. Her escape sends her crashing down into Corbin's taxi that leads to a wild flying car chase that holds well with special effects these twenty years later.Zorg is angry when he finds the case empty without any stones and tricks the aliens into blowing themselves up with some crazy rifle. Corbin brings Leeloo to Cornelius who helps decipher Leeloo's language that the stones are hidden with an opera singer on a paradise cruise off the planet. Zorg summons Cornelius to find out where the stones are but his bargaining does not go as planned. The evil blob calls Zorg ordering him to find the stones. Corbin finds out he is fired as he finds out he is being recruited for a mission to go to Fhloston Paradise. Unfortunately, Cornelius and Leeloo show up and then the police. The police capture his neighbor but the aliens steal the captive neighbor. Cornelius knocks Corbin over the head stealing the cruise ticket. Corbin accepts the mission and meets David (Charlie Creed-Miles) and Leeloo there, getting aboard.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",

Because of these things, it was impossible for me to care whatsoever for any of them.The theme of the film--basically that we should make love, not war--is ignored for most of the movie and then shoved in our faces at the very end in a very trite manner.  The romance between Willis and Jovovich is extremely underdeveloped.  Although many of the things that happen in the movie are funny, many of them are also rather predictable and a few even seem like they were taken directly from an episode of Full House.The film did have its positives, though.  The visuals were gorgeous, and the direction (cinematography and editing) was quite nice.  The junk airship was really cool.  Watching Leloo make chicken was very funny.But all that wasn't enough to make this movie any better than mediocre.

Actually the movie exceeds my expectations. It's a thoroughly gleeful sci-fi/action romp brimming with creativity; marvellous inventive visuals, distinctive style and idiosyncratic tone, and splendid and utterly unique world-building.The characters are quite relatable, and well-developed and have some reasonable depth into them, especially Leeloo, who brought to life by Milla Jovovich. Bruce Willis showed his solid action chops and plenty of stamina and charisma to make Korben Dallas a quite likable hero. Gary Oldman plays the villain of the movie, Zorg, and I think that his fantastic over-the top performance is more than enough to elevate his rather uneven character that was hindered by the decline of the plot's cleverness.The movie also has an awesome utilization of its electrifying soundtrack in the action sequences, which are pretty cool!The Fifth Element is a helluva fun time; but that doesn't necessarily mean it's dumb at all. In fact the movie has some surprisingly deep moments that work pretty well despite the fact that Luc Besson never wanted us to take his movie seriously.

It's a wild fantasy ride 300 years into the future that makes this one enjoyably satisfying, but the imagination gets clearly overstated by making itself too obnoxious. Of course, the visuals are as good as any recent sci-fi outing and there is some appropriate meaning about a female life-form while staying alive to prevent the end of the world from coming. The big beef is that its futuristic setting gets over-exaggerated for its strange behavior. Part of this factor is Chris Tucker, who is downright annoying as a radio freak on hyperwarp. I like how science fiction is vigorously refined for the 90s and beyond. I wish the film crews and directors would find better alternatives in not forging over the top on excess junk material. Pray that STAR WARS - EPISODE ONE doesn't fall into the sleaze trap where STARSHIP TROOPERS and this film landed in.Sony, your formula is greatly showing. Keep it up, or we'll run your godd--n studio like a bunch of professionally trained business execs who want to discuss a corporate takeover!",

A good sci-fi film makes you wonder could this ever really happen?  The Fifth Element did not do that.  For one, all of the bright colors and ridiculous outfits were completely unbelievable, and I mean that negatively.  The storyline, although it's been done a hundred times, suffered from the cartoony set design.  How could I believe the world was coming to an end when everything looks like it came out of a Saturday morning kids program?  A dark, brooding set design would have been better.  The film does have one saving grace-Mila Jovovich.  Her character is interesting and fun because of her conflict; she was built as a weapon but was like a child.  Other than that, all of the other performances, especially Bruce Willis's flat Rambo wannabe, were uninspired and the set design crippled the film so badly it wasn't even worth watching.",

However, if you're looking for somegiggles and action-packed creative fun, this is the one for you.It's bright, colorful, quirky, and fast-paced.

From that unbelievable 'Diva's Song' to the endless ramblings of Ruby Rhod, to Zorg's -er, head plate, there's nothing remotely like it that you'll see anywhere else.It almost serves as a spoof of sci-fi with it's silly aliens and ridiculous gadgets.

In the context of this SF-movie, the authors active in France and Belgium would be the most important, although there are fine examples in other genres across the continent.In my opinion, no movie before or after The Fifth Element was able to bring together the artistic aspirations of the comic book scene with the blockbuster format. In fact, it does it in such a way that it never gets cheesy, even in the \"emotional\" scenes. It is important to point this out, because the current benchmark are the titles from the Marvel Cinematic Universe which tries to hide the lack of content through an overload of CGI.Many years after watching The Fifth Element I learned that Alejandro Jodorowsky sued Luc Besson for allegedly ripping of the The Incal series, which is one of the legendary comic books from the aforementioned scene. Actually the truth behind it isn't important for my review. I'm pointing this out it merely because in the years since the release of The Fifth Element no one ever mentioned that the character played by Bruce Willis might have been based on the taxicab driver from Heavy Metal (1981), another legendary movie based on comic books. The character is called Harry Canyon, in a segment of the same name.",

The acting, despite the cheese, and such great humor, particularly by Chris Tucker and all of Bruce Willis's subtleties and sarcasm.

Korben is a retired special forces major who unknowingly takers this mysterious vandal in without realizing that she maybe earth's Saviour along with 4 peculiar stones otherwise known as classical elements.While head of the Zorg corporation, Jean-Baptiste Zorg(Oldman)wants these for something else And that's all I'm saying watch it you to find out what happens....if you like Sci-fi films might enjoy it or not. The story is quite unusual and Intriguing and the film tries not to take it self to serious which I enjoyed and also helped with it's humor. The Production design is mad and queer and almost looks psychedelic which left a feel to the eyes which made me want to see more of the utopia for the future.The characters were acted well but I felt they weren't developed well to actual care for them enough.Gary Oldman's Jean-baptiste Emanuel Zorg was,Superbly acted as was Willi's Korben. Some funny dialogue and over the top action Kept Me entertained for the most of the film.My Biggest Problem is that the pace is very inconsistent and some seem feel forced and tend drag on when there no need and it looses your focus and also Chris Tucker's super gay TV anchorman is probably More irritating then Star wars' Jar-Jar Binks being he has much more screen time and that the character is completely unnecessary to the plot,I was considering turning it off it he annoyed me so much .What Will say is don't watch this film with high expectations as you might disappointed but it warrants a watch for sure.",

It's like nothing you've ever seen before and it never takes itself too seriously. But in the process of trying to make a good looking movie, he failed to make it a great movie. The story itself is rather simple. There's a bad force in the universe and the only way to stop it is with four sacred stones and the titular Fifth Element. This happens to be the universe's supreme being. Not God or anything like that but a perfect being. A perfect being played by the lovely Milla Jovovich. She, along with taxicab driver and former Special Forces soldier Bruce Willis must fetch the stones and get back to the Great Pyramid to stop the great evil from destroying the Earth and taking over the universe. The movie itself comes off a little unhinged at times and more than just a little schizophrenic with elements and scenes that don't really fit into the narrative. And of course there's the elephant in the room in the form of Chris Tucker as a larger than life, hyperactive and extremely fast talking radio DJ. He's extremely polarizing with people that love him and people that can't stand him. It's definitely achieved the status of a cult classic movie with people either loving it or hating it.

            "content": "...he'll give it to you and waste 90 million bucks doing it.It was a highly anticipated, over-hyped blockbuster from Luc Besson of \"Nikita\" and \"Leon\" fame, featuring Bruce Willis still sitting on laurels from his performance in wonderful \"12 Monkeys\" just a year before. What I was expecting was nothing short of a miracle in film- making, thinking how European cinematography can only outdo Hollywood once it lays its hands on similarly high budget.Yes, my expectations were pretty much slaughtered once the film started rolling. What I got in for was a mere charade of clich\u00e9s, goofy acting and unwanted moral lessons garnished with the music of the hour. Nothing in it had any meaning or weight to it. I tried to watch it as a silly comedy but nothing really did it for me back then (and the guy laughing hysterically in the seat behind me certainly didn't help). Then I expected at least some point to all that and indeed it was laid heavy handedly upon the audience in the end when, out of the blue, the movie detoured into dead serious. Of course, by that point, I gave up and made sure not to take anything in it seriously. Goes especially for Besson's teenage naivet\u00e9 in making his case against war and human nature (one has to wonder about him - the man was closing 40 at the time). I was probably just as naive as him expecting something else.Nowadays, however, I try not to miss \"The 5th element\" whenever they air it on TV. Once you go past the pretentious BS you can find in it precious gems that redeem the movie. One of those is certainly Chris Tucker and his outlandish performance (the only thing I could acknowledge as quality even back then). Too bad his character was conceived as a strictly sidekick - there were opportunities for him to develop into a really meaningful protagonist. Many of supporting characters and lines are also funny (although majority still isn't - I classify it under \"the French humor\"). The cinematography and art design are lovely in their colorfulness and, in retrospect, it's a treat to watch Bruce Willis from the era while he still had some hair to his head.",

            "content": "When I first heard about this movie, I knew I wanted to see it and I had a hell of a time when I did. I could see right away that this film was heavily influenced by the work of French graphic artist Moebius. Sure enough, when I saw the credits, there was Moebius' name. The film captures the European sci-fi style that permeated Metal Hurlant and featured the work of Moebius and other top European artists. I think this is one of the facets that many film critics couldn't understand. They only seem to be able to handle Kubrick or Lucas. I was amazed that many called the film incomprehensible. It makes more sense than the last third of 2001: A Space Odyssey!The film has nice balance of action, drama and comedy. It doesn't take itself too seriously, nor does it degenerate into camp; and, it is always exciting. Bruce Willis puts in a nice turn as the hero and Mila Jovavich shines as Leeloo. Gary Oldman gets to chew some scenery and Ian Holm is always good. Heck, even Tiny Lister is passable, which is saying a lot for him. The music is outstanding, as is always the case with Eric Serra. The opera piece was hypnotic. I didn't even mind Chris Tucker.I have heard some people claim that the story is borrowed from the Harry Canyon sequence from Heavy Metal. Actually, Harry Canyon was borrowed (or stolen) from Moebius and Dan O'Bannon's \"The Long Tomorrow\", a Dashiell Hammet rif in a sci-fi setting. The producers were unable to secure the rights for the story and created their own, similar sory (much like Tarna was inspired by Arzach). The Fifth Element owes more to the Valerian graphic novels by Jean-Claude Mezieres and Pierre Christin. These stories date back to the late 60's, and Mezieres was a conceptual designer, along with Moebius, for The Fifth Element. Moebius' \"Incal\" was also a major influence. In fact, the original story for this movie was changed to make the hero a taxi driver (instead of a factory worker) after seeing a flying taxi in Mezieres' latest Valerian album.Although there is no set up for a sequel, I would love to see these characters again, or see Besson work in sci-fi again. I need something to take away the bad taste of the new Star Wars films! (By the way, was the Princess Leia hairdo on the female soldier a deliberate homage? I laughed my head off when I saw that scene in the theater.)",

The prologue was somewhat misconceived, though I guess it was necessary for plot purposes, but once things kicked in with the future, it was entertaining.  Luc Besson knows how to make entertaining junk food, as he did with \"Nikita\" and \"The Professional\", and he does it again here.  For one thing, he takes the time to create a dazzling world that also makes sense.  It's colorful, eye-popping, and visionary.  For another, while the story is pretty standard, it's told with style, wit, and verve.Except for one or two over-the-top performances per film, it seems Besson favors deadpan acting as a form of humor, and the actors here are well-suited to it.  Willis can be monotonous in films like \"The Last Boy Scout\", but here, he's got something to react to, and he does it well.  Ian Holm lends a touch of gravity to the film, as always.  Milla Jovovich is just fine as Leeloo, playing as if things were just occuring to her.  The two over-the-top performances, of course, come from Chris Tucker and Gary Oldman.  I can see why some thought Tucker annoying, but I thought he was funny.  But, of course, he was no match for Oldman, who, as he proved in \"The Professional\", is an entertaining villain.  His voice (which he claimed was a cross between Ross Perot and Bugs Bunny) was even funny.  All in all, check your brain at the door and have a good time.",

Outfits that look like they sprung from a combination of a nightmare and fantasy adorn the denizens of Earth, and various other planets, 250 years in the future.  Bruce Willis plays a cabbie who has the task of saving the world from ultimate evil. Piece of cake compared to driving a cab in New York.  Luc Besson manages to pack every scene with so much detail, it's staggering to watch for the first time.  Sure it's a bit silly, and if you stop and analyze it too much, the film falls apart.  But that's not why he made it.  The Fifth Element is a thrill ride pure and simple.  You have action, fantastic visuals, a really weird sense of humor, (courtesy of Chris Tucker's performance) and an over the top villain.

            "content": "** 1/2 out of ****The Fifth Element may very well be the most elaborate, visually magnificent film I've ever seen. Everything, from the spaceships to the flying cars to the city, is an example of eye-popping special effects. For that alone, I would recommend it. There are several other things going for it, too, though I can't forget the fact that the story is a mess and many individual scenes are annoying and headache-inducing. Hey, everything comes with a price, and these visuals are no different.In terms of plot, let's just say the film takes place a few hundred years in the future, and Bruce Willis is the hero who must save the Earth before a huge ball of evil will destroy it. To do so, Willis needs the help of the fifth element, turns out its Milla Jovovich. Impeding the good guys are a band of ugly aliens and an over-the-top Gary Oldman as a nasty businessman named Zorg.There are a lot of little things about The Fifth Element that bug me. First is Zorg's motivations. Apparently, he's been chosen by that big ball of evil to hinder Willis and Jovovich, and he cooperates seemingly because he believes in a big financial pay-off. Exactly what he can do with any riches after the Earth is destroyed raises more than a few questions. Basically, Oldman's just here to chew the scenery and give us a human villain, even though in the end, he isn't particularly menacing and never even comes face-to-face with Willis.Rather, the villains who participate in the physical action are a group of really ugly aliens (whose names I can't think of at the moment) that have the ability to shapeshift. These aliens look really silly, but I'll give director Luc Besson the benefit of the doubt and assume the effect was entirely intentional. Even then, they don't make for very imposing antagonists, they're almost as easy to kill as storm troopers, and they're only slightly more competent.But such flaws are made up for by not only the movie's great look, but its sense of fun. At its heart, The Fifth Element is not science fiction but a comical action/adventure with mismatched heroes, a \"damsel in distress\", and bad guys who threaten the world itself. Bruce Willis makes for a great deadpan hero, and as usual, excels during the action sequences. Jovovich isn't quite my idea of the perfect being, but she's acceptable in her role. Almost taking me out of the movie is an annoying Chris Tucker as an androgynous DJ. He's here as comic relief, and while he gets off a few good laughs, he's more of a detriment than anything else.Surprisingly enough, even though The Fifth Element moves at a fast pace, there are only a few all-out action scenes. Aside from a flying car chase (which Star Wars Episode II obviously took inspiration from) and a big climactic gun battle, there's not a whole lot of physical violence going on here, at least not when compared to some of the other sci-fi action films released around the same time (Star Trek: First Contact, Alien Resurrection, Starship Troopers).Keeping the film consistently enjoyable is Besson's sense of humor. He knows well enough not to take such a story seriously, so don't be surprised by how much the movie acknowledges its own silliness. I've not seen a whole lot from Besson that I liked (I always found The Professional overrated and The Messenger a bloated, though not entirely unenjoyable, mess), but The Fifth Element comes the closest to a movie of his that I genuinely liked. There's much from this movie I enjoyed and I do recommend it, but cut off the chaff, and we could've had a sci-fi/action classic on our hands and not just a good timewaster.",

            "content": "The Fifth Element is a triumph of style. Everything looks and sounds fantastic, from the Jean Paul Gautier created outfits to the varied and interesting soundtrack. Luc Besson co-wrote and directed this French science fiction film that is so over the top, madly unhinged in places (a space-ball of pure evil phones a guy!) and infectious that I can't help but be carried along for the (occasionally) bumpy ride.The overall style of the film flicks nicely between clean and technological spaces to piles of rubbish, tiny apartments and gritty, foggy parts of the world. The characters are pristine and beautiful, dressed in futuristic attire and haircuts, but get mucky and bloodied within seconds.The same duality applies to the story , flicking madly between glorious action, absurd space opera and sappy love story often within the space of a scene. To be honest, the story is not the film's strong point. I can admit that willingly. It's a simple 'Oh no! Earth is in peril, let us go on an adventure' type film. But the adventure is the film's strength and it plays to it with relish. Bruce Willis gives one of his finer performances and Gary Oldman plays his baddie with a delicious sense of fun and pantomime. Milla Jovovich (in an early film performance) plays the 'perfect being' Leeloo with a surprisingly level of range and emotion. She also looks the part. Also looking like he's having all together a whole heap of fun is Ian Holm.More here: http://thegiff.typepad.com/film_flare/",

Nowadays all scifi's are either \"soap-operas in space\" (e.g. Star Trek-TNG, Andromeda, Earth Final Conflict, etc.)or \"horror\" movies (e.g. John Carpenter's \"The Thing,\" and the \"Alien Bunch\"). This one (like \"Lost in Space\") had no message the director felt needed to be shoved down your apparently unenlightened throat. It was a movie that entertained from start to finish.Bruce is wonderful to watch even if he is only standing up against a wall and delivering a single line: \"That's a negatory, I am a meat-popsicle.\" (Proof: this line has been quoted to, and by, me many times.) Bruce is great. If you are a scifi fan you should really like this one, and Bruce makes it better than ever.Chris Tucker is great as \"Ruby Rhod.\" Watching his performance makes you realize how hard he must have worked to totally dedicate himself to playing this totally off the wall character. Kudos to Chris for a super job well-done. What I realized about his role was that I didn't keep thinking \"When is Bruce going to show up?\" That's a major accomplishment since it is very hard to appear interesting up against a star like Bruce Willis. So the movie had a triple punch of great acting.Triple because I would be remiss if I didn't mention that \"Zorg\" was *solidly* played by Leonard Gary Oldman. I was entranced by his stalwart singular focus mercenary/business man/genius. Just as interesting a character so as not to steal the show from anyone else nor make you long for another appearance from the others.This points to the great writing and directing - both allowed the characters to breath and develop without suffocating any other stars' roles. The production was very cool... I'm liking this movie even more now the more I describe it! :)Great scifi. Go see it.Zafoid",

            "content": "With the possible exception of \"The Professional,\" just about anything Luc Besson does is high art. The man who did \"La Femme Nikita\" gets excellent performances out of his actors and managers to crowd many plot lines into a plausible script. Such is the case for \"The Fifth Element.\" Basically, the plot (which you really won't care about when the film starts) deals with an alien culture that deposits four stones on Earth. Each stone is centered around a natural element. In the center of these stones is supposed to be a fifth element that will work with the other four to create a weapon to defeat pure evil. The aliens who placed them -- the Mondashawans -- eventually retrieve them and promise to return in 300 years.300 years later, a massive living fireball appears and streaks towards Earth. It makes short work of space cruisers that try to nuke it, which opens the door for the typical sci-fi \"only one thing can stop it\" scenario.What ensues is almost comedic mayhem as the living fireball that represents pure evil enlists an evil industrialist named Jean-Baptiste Emanuel Zorg to get the stones. Zorg, in turn, uses subordinates when he really should do it himself. Among his cohorts are ugly aliens called Bangalores, who ambush and kill the Mondashawans, but don't get the Fifth Element (they only wanted the stones and weren't aware of just how close they came to helping destroy Earth).The government revives the Fifth element, who as a confused humanoid named Leeloo, escapes and ends up in the cab of driver Korben Dallas. She has him take her to a priest who will know what to do.Of course, no one knows where the stones are so Dallas, who was once a special forces soldier who left the service in a vain attempt to salvage his marriage, is brought back into service. The priest tries to save the world with Leeloo. Zorg keeps sending henchmen out for the stones and everyone is running around with heads cut off.Sounds confusing, I know. But, it works. There are close calls, exciting car chases, excellent fight scenes and lots of comedy. The special effects are sumptuous, the music rocks and the suspense builds. The Earth of the future looks just like current Earth, except now everything flies. Besson knows editing and just when it looks like Zorg has got the stones, the scene cuts to another character foiling his plot. For instance, Korben doesn't want to go back into service. Zorg then indifferently fires a million workers, including Korben, thus freeing up the man who will eventually challenge him.There are lots of inside jokes that require repeated viewings to spot. Also, something rare occurs in this film. Antagonist and protagonist never meet. Korben and Zorg never face each other or even know about each other But, the best reason to watch this film is the acting. Bruce Willis plays Korben Dallas and this film was the second of the \"numbers\" film that revived his flagging career (joining \"The 6th Sense,\" \"12 Monkeys\" and \"The Whole Nine Yards\"). He doesn't have too many facial expressions, but he has an excellent sense of comic timing. Ian Holm as the priest continues to add to his impressive resume that includes \"Fellowship of the Ring,\" \"Return of the King\" and \"Alien.\" Gary Oldman (\"Bram Stoker's Dracula,\" \"Romeo Is Bleeding,\" \"Air Force One\") adds yet another sinister villain to his repertoire. I especially like how he spouts off disproved economic principles (like his speech to Holm about the need for chaos and disorder) in a cruel satire of modern corporate politics.The only weak spot is Milla Jovovich, who plays Leeloo. The Ukrainian-born actress mostly gets to show off her body (as she does in her \"Resident Evil\" trilogy). She does shine, though, in a spectacular fight scene against the Bangalores, one which Besson superbly aligns with an operatic aria. Interestingly, Jovovich married Besson shortly after filming, but divorced him two years later (she is now engaged to Paul W.S. Andersen, the \"Resident Evil\" director).The supporting cast is also good and they mostly play against type. Tiny Lister, a 6'7\" big man used to doing strong, silent types in movies like \"Posse\" and \"Trespass,\" plays the President. The late Brion James, one of Hollywood's ultimate movie villains in films like \"Blade Runner,\" is a hoot as Korben's commanding general. Also shining is Luke Perry (yes, that Luke Perry, of \"Beverly Hills 90210\") as Ian Holm's assistant (he's almost unrecognizable). Add in British musician Tricky as Zorg's right-hand man whose aspirations of being a big shot don't match his abilities. Throw in a dash of French actress Maiwenn Le Besco as the scrumptious Diva Plavalaguna and you get an excellent supporting cast. The operatic aria by the Diva is one of the film's highlights.To be sure, there are a few flaws. The countdown to the fireball hitting Earth is off by about 10 seconds. The airport is full of uncollected garbage and I still can't figure out how it fits into the film. The phone calls from Korben's mom get annoying real fast (except at the end). And Chris Tucker's flamboyant Rhuby Rod does get annoying real fast, although he does calm down at the end.Still, get this film for your collection. It's well worth it, especially on the special DVD edition.",

Gary Oldman is his usual great self (some guys make you want to cry \"INJUSTICE\" having all the talent in the galaxy), the supporting crew is fine (kudos to Ian Holm and Chris Tucker), the plot is classic sci-fi and Mila Jovovich is the price you have to pay for seeing a movie made by her SO (sorry but I can't stand her neither as a woman nor as a model -let's not talk about acting, OK?).Action is also wonderful. Fast, rhythmic and rightly balanced. If you haven't seen it already, raise your antennas when the blue diva starts singing \"Lucia di Lammermoor\" (this is *not* a spoiler!). It is one of the best directed action scenes made in the last 50 years as well as a very good version of the aria. Even Jovovich couldn't make it look bad.\nThe movie's peak though, is the atmosphere, the ambiance.

Maybe it's because of those dreamy visuals of the 22nd century, maybe it's because of the way Besson sees it, maybe it's because of the way Eric Serra gives it music, maybe it's because of Milla's smile, maybe it's because of its harmonial mix between action, comedy and drama. Maybe it's because of all those things combined. I just know that we can't situate this movie in any genre, since I don't see it as a science fiction movie, or a drama or a comedy, a bit like \"The Big Blue\", a bit like \"Leon\". Certainly (i'm sure) an epic movie in all the meaning of the word. I loved every minute and when I become a movie director, Besson will be my guiding light, since he sees things like I like to see them: BIG. Every shot of this movie is measured epically. I loved it, no matter what, Jovovich, Willis, Tucker, Holm, Oldman, they all have talent to spare, and once more, you, Luc, if you read this, I want you to know you already are an inspiration. Congratulations, this movie is worth every penny spent in it, and every drop of sweat shed. I could watch it once a day and not get tired.",

            "content": "Luc Besson is known all over the world thanks to several films, including the brilliant \"Fifth Element\". The director is not alone in taking up space fiction. Bruce Willis, the savior of all the Earth, becomes his assistant. A star of this scale is a great decoration for this film. Willis is charismatic, courageous, a true hero who goes straight through hordes of enemies. He does this with special zeal, because the hero met Lila, who, by the way, is performed by the magnificent Mila Jovovich. The girl coped perfectly with the role of the most formidable weapon in the universe. At the same time, the heroine is incredibly feminine and beautiful. All this is thanks to Jovovich's game.And of course, in this tandem it was impossible to do without a charismatic villain, who was tastefully portrayed on the screen by Gary Oldman.The film begins as a gloomy and even slightly apocalyptic action movie. However, the further you look, the more you realize that after all, this is mostly an entertaining movie. The charm of the film is added by the unique Chris Tucker, who smartly conveys the strangely funny pop culture of the future. He's really gorgeous. In my opinion, half of the film is based on it, and the phrase \"Corben, darling\" has become a household name.The film has beautiful colorful scenery, decent graphics, amazingly bright costumes. And a very memorable track, which is performed by Plava Laguna, the blue girl in the opera of the future. This composition is still recognizable and popular to this day.The whole comedy of what is happening is somehow magically intertwined with the main message of the whole film, which says that only true love can save the whole world.And after watching this masterpiece, you begin to believe in it with renewed vigor.9 out of 10.",

            "content": "\"The Fifth Element\" is a brilliantly overdone SF action extravaganza. It rips off probably just about every other SF movie ever made, while at the same time throwing in a lot of nonsense of its own (the floating Japanese restaurant boat still has me laughing out loud) and somehow molding all of this into a two-hour rollercoaster ride that leaves you with the feeling \"wow, how on earth did they manage to put all of that into two hours\".\nThe strength of this movie is that it doesn't take itself seriously for one moment. Sure, the story deals with the destruction of the earth and there's violence and death everywhere. But it's all cartoon violence: it's so overdone that you can't possibly take it all seriously. Add to this a host of completely over-the top characters, like a crazed game show host, a super-clumsy acolyte, a priest that looks a lot like Obi-Wan Kenobi, and a bad guy that takes sardonic laughter and over-the-top acting to a new level, and you know your in for a treat. And to top it all off, there's Bruce Willis who seems to be approaching this movie as \"Die Hard meets Star Wars\".\nLike Star Wars, this movie is unbelievable and silly to the extreme, but also like Star Wars, that's its biggest strength. If you want a serious SF action movie, rent \"Alien\" . If you want an SF movie with a good story, rent Total Recall. But if you want an SF movie that provides you with two hours of uncomplicated fun, try this one.***1/2 out of **** stars",

            "content": "I've always been a great fan of Luc Besson. With his chic Gallic ideas you can be sure that the presentational style of any his films is always going to be interesting.Leon is my favourite Besson film because it handles a difficult subject with a steady & intelligent hand, while still offering plenty of explosions & gun fights to keep the action fans content.The 5th Element, however, is more of mixed bag and I do feel he went a little too far with the ingredients - adding far too much visual candy and not enough dialogue & logic. The final outcome is a rather a mismatch of stylish ideas based on a thin storyline foundation.For Willis, as our 23rd century cab driver turned galactic hero, its just another Die Hard vehicle. As soon as he dons his white vest you just know he's going to be involved in a load of death defying stunts. So there are no radical acting departures for Willis which is a poor start because once we realize this fact everything else becomes a tad predictable.Milla Jovovich, as the alien visitor Leeloo, does a good job of a rather dysfunctional character. She doesn't have to do very much apart from mumble some alien speech and come over all cutesy and doey eyed when required.\nIan Holm is grossly miscast as the all-knowing priest. You can sometimes see from his body language & facial expressions how uncomfortable he feels with the dialogue & acting he is given. He tries hard to convince but I think he inwardly knows that this film is just plastic pap with a heavy dose of French mustard.  Gary Oldman plays the fascist yet again, hamming it up like there's no tomorrow (which in this particular film is just as well), just like in Besson's earlier film, Leon. Credit where credits due though, he does seem to be enjoying his role more than the others and you're almost guaranteed a good performance from him no matter how poor the script.Chris Tucker, however, really does ruin this film big style. He is totally OTT and screams & shouts like a little brat not getting his Christmas treats. The film is loud & garrish enough with him having to add to it, but he does so anyway and makes a real hash of everything around him.On the whole therefore, the film will be remembered more for its special effects than logical storyline. Besson has gone overboard with the $90 million budget,spending at least 95% of it on the sfx and the other 5% on the story, which is a great great shame.With a more intelligent script and with perhaps James Cameron or Gayle Anne Hurd producing, then I'm sure this film would have been a real blockbuster rather than the hotch potch we have here.\n***/*****",

            "content": "I've never particularly enjoyed the whole space-age sci-fi stuff, but when I saw that \"The Fifth Element\" was directed by Luc Besson - the creator of the brilliant film \"Leon: The Professional\", I thought I would give this one a shot.The film opens in Egypt, 1914. A team of archaeologists or historians of sorts are examining ancient runes. These runes turn out to be a prophesy about the state of the Universe far into the future - a state wherein a Fifth Element is needed in order to prevent everything from falling under the rule of darkness. Right off the bat, the script is smart and creative, the visuals are beautiful to look at, and I'm ready to settle in for another Besson masterpiece... Then in roll the aliens.Have you ever seen \"The Dark Crystal\"? If not, all you need to know is that it's a laughably awful movie from the creator of The Muppets which happens to have a very similar storyline - and the stupidest looking puppets ever designed. Well, the aliens that landed in Egypt in 1914 apparently came straight from that horrible movie. So much for my high expectations.Cut scene to 300 years later where Jedi Master Bilbo Baggins - aka Father Cornelius played by the very talented Ian Holm - is talking to what I imagine to be the President of the Universe(imagine the election process) about the all-powerful elemental stones and the perfect being that will play a key part saving all life from falling under evil forces. Yadda-yadda-yadda. Cool.On that note, we meet Bruce Willis who is reprising his role in \"Die Hard\" in the form of Korben Dallas - a washed up hover-taxi(gag me)driver with more to him than meets the eye. But for now, all he wants is to avoid losing another point off of his license and to find the perfect woman to settle down with. BAM. Who else should fall through the roof of his cab but an orange haired and babbling Milla Jovovich - who just so happens to be, well, the perfect woman. She's even gift-wrapped in a strategically placed ribbon. Oh yeah, she's also the Fifth Element. How perfect! But what's a space flick without a campy villain working for the forces of evil? Enter Jean Baptist Emanuel Zorg, an intergalactic arms dealer who is trading his weapons for the aforementioned stones so that he can hand them over to the bad guys... Pfft, Who needs a future of peace and happiness for all living beings? Apparently not this guy, who looks like Deep-South Hitler combined with the Gay Pride Parade - And is played by none other than the fab-u-lous Gary Oldman. Zorg is one of the many many factors that make this film completely ridiculous, but he is nonetheless the most entertaining thing about it.That's really all I'm going to tell you for now plot-wise, but if you decide to watch this film, keep in mind that you are in for a frenetic and obnoxious space adventure that combines every element from every nonsense space film ever created into a big,cheesy,ultra-campy, but undeniably captivating mess. Why is it captivating? Well, it's certainly not anything to do with Chris Tucker's teeth-grindingly irritating performance as big media personality with hair resembling either a handgun or a penis, but because of Besson's imaginative use of bright colours, fast-paced storytelling, amusing characters, and that hauntingly beautiful voice of an odd-looking blue Diva.Does this redeem Fifth Element from its many flaws? Certainly not. I mean, there's hardly a moment where someone isn't stuttering or just spewing out nonsense in a whiny voice, the dialogue can be super-lame at times, and Besson's futuristic universe looks as though it was engineered by 12 year old boys who spend every Saturday morning watching the Jetsons... And as for the costumes? I weep for the future of fashion.So I'm giving this movie a 5/10. It was completely silly from start to finish, but as long as you don't take it seriously, it's kinda cute. I would recommend it for younger audiences.",

Set in the 23rd century he gets embroiled in an exotic adventure.Besson devised the story when he was just 16 years old and finally realised his vision 22 years later as a labour of love project. It was the most expensive European film made at that time and was a box office success thanks to a great cast, imaginative set design, impressive special effects and an original and playful script.Besson believed that the future would be colourful and decadent rather than dark and gloomy like so many other sci-fi movies and he certainly achieves that here.

I can't understand it. Willis as Corben Dallas is a solid chunk of man style action unlikely hero who's style as one woman I know put it is 'Sexy'. Well for all intensive purposes, I don't judge his looks like that, but I was far-out too into this space-case that Dallas was on. He is surrounded by humorous aliens and humans then pursuing the drama that he does so well. Gary Oldman is a twisted and wild criminal character, he always does a job exceeding my expectations. As a fellow viewer stated the score of the film went from Enigma to Vangelis and a myriad of other types of music followed, truly wide in it's audio path. The plot, learn not to war, a little too Alan Alda for me, I never could take too much M*A*S*H, viewing in long shut me down. However all aside, I thought the casting was right where it should be and with exception of some of the aliens being a little too 'plastic' for a feel of reality, I find this is fun and entertaining every time I watch it...Chris Tucker always kills me, he is one of a kind.For sure in the end recommended to action lovers and Willis and Tucker types everywhere.

The Fifth Element is not the second-coming of Star Wars or something like Serenity, Blade Runner, etc.The Fifth Element instead is a tongue-in-cheek celebration of classic comic book science fiction that is done with class and finesse. The plot, the dialogue, the visuals, everything is done in a zany vein of both humor an style. The movie is equally adept at poking fun at the conventions of its subject matter while simultaneously appreciating it with the love of a 10-year old engrossed in a thrilling science fiction tale.In terms of visuals, Besson's flourishes are stunning and nigh-perfect in their matching the parodic/celebratory tone of the movie. The flashy colors, special effects, wonderfully performed action sequences, strange, indescribable moments of sheer wonder and overall bombast all combine well and fit the plot and dialogue like a glove.Most of all, the movie is just plain fun. The pacing is quick but not so quick as to make everything completely incoherent. The plot can be convoluded but once again this is a misunderstood element--the convolutions of the story are a deliberate play on the convolutions of classical sci-fi comic books and literature. Some might want to dispute me there, saying I'm giving the film too much credit, but Besson is not an idiotic director, and he didn't take transcribe the plot of a story he wrote in 10th grade just because he thought it would be a complicated tale of human triumph; he did it to be parodic, while never losing sight of the fun and color that makes sci-fi as enjoyable as it is.People will always say that 'The Fifth Element' is guilty of style over substance. I contend that the substance is there, it's merely that it is not the substance that those looking for the next uber-serious 'Blade Runner' want to praise. It is a substance as pulpy as can be, but like 'Pulp Fiction' it raises the 'low' art of such substance to the level of 'high' art. It's only problem is that most critics today aren't willing to accept this \"low-art-made-high\" and will discard any movie that embraces it as 'empty-headed.' But, then again, they don't get called 'snooty' for nothing.",

You can see parts of that same sequence is Spielberg's 'Minority Report' as well. In fact James Cameron's Digital Domain has created a work that stands the test of time and looks 100% real, while ILM's work on a lot more recent projects looks completely fake.This movie is all about aesthetics. Although the story is interesting, you can ignore the dialog and still have fun. It's a cross between Star Gate, Blade Runner and Star Wars.Together with 'Starship Troopers', the Fifth Element is the best Sci-Fi movie of the 90s.9/10",

            "content": "French film auteur Luc Besson has written, directed and produced some classic films and \"The Fifth Element\" was his first stab at a big-budget Hollywood-style Sci-Fi blockbuster. Jaded American film critics gave the film a so-so reception on its release. This faint praise put moviegoers off and the film wasn't a huge commercial success. Having said that, \"The Fifth Element\" has gone on to achieve the sort of cult status shared by \"Blade Runner\" and the \"Terminator\" movies. Despite a big American star in the lead role, this film is fundamentally Gallic and none the worse for it.Luc Besson collaborated with top French comic book artists and even roped in Jean Paul Gaultier to design the fashions of the 23rd Century. The film was shot in Europe and a lot of well-known British and French actors can be seen in the cast. He even managed to coax a decent performance out of Bruce Willis! But that's enough background. What's the movie actually like? Well, sort of like a celluloid comic book; bursting with inventive imagery, populated with larger-than-life characters and peppered with smart dialogue. The plot is pretty linear and predictable but Besson's sense of style and fun makes it entertaining. The movie is endlessly diverting, as a constant stream of bizarre characters and incredible visuals spool past your eyes at light-speed. \"The Fifth Element\" was made for the DVD format and it's worth pausing to view the detailed streetscapes of New York, or catch the antics of the extras in almost every crowd scene.As I've already mentioned, Bruce Willis appears in this movie but don't let that put you off. Besson reins in Willis's usual \"Look-at-meeeeeee\" screen preening, but allows just enough of the actor's natural charisma to show through the character he plays. Willis is admirably matched by ever-reliable Gary Oldman as the arch-villain and Milla Jovovich is perfectly unworldly as the alien love-interest. \"The Fifth Element\" may not have been a box-office smash but perhaps that's a good thing. We need directors with a unique vision to counter Hollywood's homogenised movie output. Even if he never makes another sci-fi movie, at least Luc Besson's talents haven't been diluted by the influence of the La-La Land bean counters.",

The plot is just great, with plot twists that add interest to the film. It is also worth mentioning about many of the rofl moments. They dilute the atmosphere. As far as the acting is concerned, it is pretty good. I think about Bruce Willis a lot of writing is not worth it because he is, as always, on top. What about others? Milla perfectly portrayed the role of Leeloo with all the emotions. But I want to highlight the Chris Tucker played Ruby. THIS IS THE BEST CHARACTER !! Damn, I don't even know how to describe my emotions about Ruby. Is it enough that he's just the best ok?))\nbut there is no such film where everything is fine right? (although I'm not sure lol) in the film, as I think, the aliens were absurd (?) in terms of not their very presence, but how they look. Although do not forget that the film was filmed in 97 so it's not surprising. By the way, the last scene with Leeloo and Korben was very unexpected and cool (whoever disagrees, agree))\nWELL\nI bet 8/10. Because of the damn aliens and the open ending. I don't really like this, because damn it, how can I be sure that everything will end well for them ???That's all thanks for reading :)",

The Fifth Element, will be watched in film schools and still be popular in 100 years, it has the perfect blend of future gadgets, tons of actions, great humor and very interesting story to follow as well. Love the fact that Luc, wrote and directed this film. He also had gotten a great cast with Bruce, Tucker and his then wife Milla Jovovich. Set in a not so far future, the eternal battle between good and evil is shown to us in an extravagant setting. Flying cars, spaceships that go at the speed of light, weird and mystical creatures and ugly aliens are only a few things that are present during this film. The story has never been seen before : Good has only one weapon to defeat evil; it is composed of four stones representing the four element (water, earth, fire and air) and a perfect creature. These five elements have to be united before the forces of evil arrive to earth. But evil has found help and the stones have disappeared. Bruce Willis (one of the best action actors of our time), Milla Jovovich, Ian Holm and Gary Oldman make the suspense even more intense. Chris Tucker is incredibly funny and ads a lot to the comic side of the film. The story is extremely imaginative.",

All of these things, packed into one film, make it difficult to feel as if the film was \"missing\" something. The back and forth between a very serious Bruce Willis and a way overly flamboyant Chris Tucker is priceless. For those saying Chris Tucker was \"annoying\" or \"too much\" missed the point of his character. He was meant to be all those things to the extreme - that's how the humor comes in. Furthermore, Milla Jovovich's character brings a nice light unknowing, strong, and gentle female character almost any girl could look up to.In a weird way (because of the dynamics of these characters) the movie has an unusual amount of replay value as well. You catch new things each time and the world they depict becomes more fascinating/fun.

The ads made it seem like an epic sci-fi adventure movie with lots of action and attractive women. Well, it does have attractive women. And some action towards the end.But this isn't really a sci-fi movie at all. It's set in the future and borrows some visual elements from other sci-fi films (I have to admit that apart from some cheesy effects and costumes, the movie looks pretty amazing), but this is purely a cartoony, campy, over-the-top comic book brought to life. If you're going to watch it, don't take any of the characters or the plot lines seriously and you'll have a much better time.That said, this just isn't a very good movie.

It's the first time I've seen it since 1997, when I saw it in the cinema.\nI didn't like it much then - probably graded it about a 4.8 in IMDB terms. I'm glad to report I was wrong. My criticism back then still stands though. After an hour of slightly silly SF epic, Chris Tucker turns up and screams at me for the rest of the film. Fortunately, it annoys me less now. Maybe I'm just used to him, having enjoyed Rush Hour? But his first scenes are still the movie's low-point. Along the way, though, there's just so much fun to be had. Besson's vision of the future, essentially a dayglo Bladerunner, is beautiful to say the least, despite being built on a bedrock of pollution and fog. And the actors all heartily overact (Ian Holm, Lee Evans, Gary Oldman) but that's part of the movie's charm. Only Willis plays it straight, recycling his joe everyman with a gun character once again, and impressing more than I remembered.\nThe design of this movie is far more praised than its script, and I think that's fair. Still, the multiple plotlines are fun to try and keep hold of, as about 6 different parties try to get on board the ship to Phloston, and the President keeps track of his agent by listening to the Rudy Rodd show. As for design, well, Besson and Gaultier do themselves proud, although the latter's costumes are occasionally distracting - note Lee Evans' sailor's uniform and Gary Oldman's odd headpiece. In the end, the Fifth Element doesn't really make sense (so is this all in aid of life on Earth then? Had the element not heard of war 5,000 years ago? what the Hell is Luke Perry doing here?) but it doesn't have to. It's nice-looking fun. Oh, but the last scene, which comes across like Moonraker crossed with some Jewish-mother comedy, is awful. I'd give it about an 8/10.",

They came here expecting a masterpiece, but its more like one of those Sci-Fi Anime's. Its over the top, unbelievable, got a atrocious plot, but you just can't help loving it!!Lonely cabby Korban Dallas (Willis) is surprised when an alien (Jovovich) falls through the roof of his taxi. But is even more shocked when he finds out she is a cosmic weapon which needs to be activated or the world will end. So he, priest Vito Cornelius (Holm) and radio presenter Ruby Rhod (Tucker) set out to fine the five elements and save the planet, all the time with evil Jean-Baptiste Emanuel Zorg (Oldman) on their heels.Honestly, This is the last place I'd expect to find Bruce Willis, the Die Hard tough guy playing a confused, ordinary guy when an alien just drops into his life (quite literally) and admittedly not is his best work. But he still plays the part reasonably well. Ian Holme is funny as the bumbling priest, Milla Jovovich pulls off what could be a laughable part (baby language and all.) Chris Tucker's the main problem, he's just annoying. But its Gary Oldman who steals the show, he is brilliant as the evil Zorg. The way he delivers some of his line is hilarious, and his timing is always perfect.Brilliant use of cheesy FX and brilliant colour make this into a form of live-animation comic book, it's just fun to generally look at, and the cheesy rubber-aliens are cool too!8/10",

            "content": "Bruce Willis saves the world, Gary Oldman plays the villain and Milla Jovovich is meant to shine as the Fifth Element. Well, there's no denying that some clich\u00e9s have to be dealt with at first glance. But director Luc Besson certainly succeeds in creating a both strange and refreshing concoction that has a solid share of many different genres: first of all, this movie represents a sci-fi-fantasy that spares its viewers irritating facts about what we need to understand about the future. Compare that to the 2014 sci-fi-milestone \"Interstellar\", which surely has its advantages over this flick but is not anywhere as entertaining. The plot line has elements of both adventure and crime in it: Pure evil in the form of an approaching planet is threatening the very existence of good ol' Earth. Violence begets only violence and therefore the planet continues to grow excessively when it is bombed or shot at with whatever weapon Earth can muster up in its desperate efforts. The only possible remedy lies in the Fifth Element which needs to be combined with the four well-known elements water, air, earth and fire to defy the evil forces. Milla Jovovich gives an amazing performance as the perfect being, the Fifth Element. Of course, the stupid humans don't get her importance and so she is chased by the police and rescued by\u0085.. Bruce Willis who was able to squeeze in another world-saving job between the Die Hard-franchise and \"Armageddon\". But you can't help enjoying Willis' unique talent for stunning action sequences (as an air cab driver in the future he can expand into another dimension) peppered by blunt remarks and disrespect for all authorities. His worthy antagonist is mimed by Gary Oldman with a forbidden haircut and a thoroughly self-ironic performance. \"The Fifth Element's strength is that it does not relies too heavily on its rather flimsy story but trusts in its creative potential to appeal to the senses: The audience may indulge the colorful bizarre costumes tailored by star designer Jean-Paul Gaultier and the futuristic cityscape. Jovovich with her fiery-red hair and immaculate body is eye-candy in its purest form. The stunning opera performance on the spaceship Phloston Island serves as an equivalent on an acoustic level. But more than any other genre, this movie lives up to its comedic potential: by telling a serious story about the impending end of the world in a decidedly unserious way, Luc Besson has created an extremely funny m\u00e9lange that hardly misses a punchline. At times, he may have overdone it if you take Chris Tucker's completely unnerving portrayal of a self-important MC. At other times, comedy oddly mixes with horror such as in a memorable scene when the villain Zorg phones with absolute Evil and he starts to sweat in such a way that his hair dye is streaming down his forehead. All in all, this flick plays out his creative potential nicely and it represents a very refreshing genre mix in an age where Hollywood bosses rather go for conformity.",

In fact, I think that after the four Star Wars movies this was the greatest movie ever.

When they are brought together it can create an unimaginable power. Then, the young woman falls in the hands of a New York City cab driver. With the help of a priest and a wierd disc jockey(which I think is like a Dennis Rodman of the future) they try to save the world.This movie was great on many accounts including, good performances, great digital design, and an interesting interpretation of the future. Willis was cool and so was Oldman. If you want to see a good sci-fi flick or just a good movie check this one out. 10/10",

            "content": "Luc Besson wrote the story of what would become \"The fifth element\" when he was sixteen years old. This teenage enthusiasm is evident in every aspect of the film, from its glamorous visuals, to its comedy with its often preposterous character. Although the film is in English, it is French from head to toe. \"The fifth element\" is, simply, science fiction \u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise.Every five thousand years, evil threatens the universe. The only way to stop it is though five elements: the classic four known to anyone who has watched \"Avatar:The Last Airbender\" (by this I mean fire, water, air and earth, here represented by four stones), and one fifth, that is so rare one has to rely on utter luck to find it. This is what happens to Korben Dallas (Bruce Willis), former army Major and taxi driver extraordinaire. This fifth element is an alien being called Leeloo (Milla Jovovich), that escapes from the laboratory she is held captive and jumps into the void, only to be saved by landing on the taxi's roof.When combined with the other four, this fifth element can prevent evil from destroying the Earth. This is something that the authorities know, and charge Dallas with saving it. It sounds simple, but it is not, when you have an evil megalomaniac, Mr. Zorg (Gary Oldman) chasing you for the stones, while some egoistic alien merchants, the Mangalores, want them as their own and are after him. This is the perfect recipe for what will be a succession of misunderstandings, surprises, and lavish spectacles, that even include a dance show starring a DJ.\"The fifth element\" is surely not a comedy, rather a tongue-in-cheek action film. The action sequences are thrilling, with Willis shining due to both his physical and his acting performance, his reserved, serious attitude coming in stark contrast to the takes he has to fulfill. The chase for the famed fifth element catches the viewer's attention from the first scenes, and the excellent Milla Jovovich as Leeloo serves the film perfectly, evolving from an innocent alien being to an experienced, capable heroine that occupies the screen and overshadows all others in her presence. Willis and her make a memorable pair, that combines the former's distant, cold rational nature and her more sentimental personality.Gary Oldman as the villain is the definition of kitsch, always dressed in luxurious outfits, visible from meters away, and his portrayal of Mr. Zorg transcends the limits of caricature and becomes rather a parody of classic science fiction nemeses. The comical aspect of the film is further reinforced through the hilarious Tom Lister Jr. Incarnating the President of this world, who doesn't only offer some great comedic scenes involving his ever-present family, but also is Besson's way of relentlessly satirising modern political leaders. That all this happens in a science fiction film just goes on to show the director's many aspects.The comedic and ironic characteristic of \"The fifth element\" contribute in giving it a human side, which is what makes it resoundingly European. Even better, the film is dominated by its cin\u00e9ma du look nature: magnificent scenery, Gaultier costumes conceived in another planet, and plenty of colour. The universe is like a canvas, which Besson has painted in the best way possible with his cinematic palette, a quality that he had already shown in his \"Le grand bleu\" nine years ago. But here it is not the sea that is explored in its preexistent beauty: Everything we see is a product of Besson's imagination, one that truly amazes sometimes.\"The fifth element\" is there to see, not to analyse. It is mostly a feast for the eyes, replacing with visual excellence what is lacking in substance. Besson has, with films like that, abandoned his auteur beginnings and become one of the most commercial French directors. But his way of going commercial often transcends his compatriots' one and becomes something unique. \"The fifth element\" is such a case, something that renders it all the more better.",

Because they don't seriously think about how science might develop in future. If you follow his strict advice, neither Star Wars nor The fifth element are true SF movies.However, both pictures are very good entertainment. Too, both are fairy tales, but while Star Wars tries to be serious, contains much magic and pseudoscience, the fifth element looks more like some kind of drug trip.The basic story couldn't be more trashy. Bruce Willis, who is the best soldier of the world seeks the perfect woman and - finds one. Besides he has to fight against some gigantic black hole which is the personalized evil.But this doesn't matter, nay, simply fits. Crazy people (Chris Tucker!), funny dialogues, very much slapstick, good action scenes, sweet romance, very good camera work - there is never a limit. Every scene is made so well, you can simply watch this movie again and again without getting bored.This my second favorite of Bruce Willis, the first one is of course Die hard.",

            "content": "This movie is grossly underrated, but I think that's because people went into it expecting something entirely different from what they got.  They went in expecting one of the following: a) Die Hard in space, b) Star Wars, or c) Independence Day.The first group saw the movie as cluttered -- they were expecting a simple action thriller where the hero is one person, *maybe* with a sidekick, and plenty of villanous cannon-fodder.  What they got was a conflict between multiple heroes with individual agendas who all basically wanted the same thing but kept getting in each others' way.  The fast editing, wild visuals, and bizarre costuming just made it look sillier.The second group saw it as small-minded -- they were expecting a well-thought-out SF epic where an ancient evil must be defeated by an ancient and nicely arcane good.  What they got was a farce where the mystical rituals were nothing more than plot devices and ultimately the fate of the universe rested on a bunch of self-centered idiots.  They were disappointed when nobody explored the ancient Mondoshewan race, when the hero only visited one other planet and then came straight back to Earth, when the \"ancient evil\" had only a corporate executive as its lackey.The third group were expecting a repeat of the previous year's hugely successful \"Independence Day.\"  They were expecting a massive invasion from hideous creatures that would ultimately be repelled by an unlikely but very plucky patriotic hero (or group of heroes) who boldly went out and saved the world in its hour of need.  With a bit of wisecracking thrown in for comic relief.  What they got was a hero who had to be *pestered* into saving the world, a general disrespect for authority, incompetant villains, incompetant heroes, and a general impression that the entire human race is a laughingstock.  Worth saving, but still a laughingstock.What all these groups didn't realize going in was that this movie is French. And this is *exactly* what French farce is all about.  It's comedy, it's silly, it's surreal, it's not meant to be taken too seriously, and it is a way to accept that life is priceless, although those who live life tend to be quite ridiculous.  How do the French have a low crime rate *and* a complete disrespect for authority?  This is how.  They don't really disrespect authority.  They just find humor in it.And that's what this is about.  The world is about to end.  And it's *funny*.  Really.  Not in the sense of your typical American situational comedies, but rather in the sense of French farce.  That is to say, it's not the situation that's funny -- the situation is the direst of all imaginable tragedies.  What's funny is the fact that everybody acts like an idiot in the face of it, from the military trying to take over despite having just proven they have no idea what they're doing, to the permanently baffled priest, to the government posturing uselessly away.  It's a good movie, but you've got to understand that it's also a very silly movie.  Go into it with a light heart and you'll enjoy.  Don't expect adrenalin or epics or patriotism.  This is about the human condition, and how fundamentally ridiculous it is.Plus, it's got a very good soprano.  I hated opera until I saw the scene where Plaga Laguna, the alien Diva, sings her aria.

With her Eastern European background, she actually manages to make it sound like a real language, unlike some Santa Monica bimbo who got a C in Spanish and couldn't find Europe on a map. This movie is pure nonsense and is almost certainly nothing like what life will really be like 250 years from now, but it has bright, Life Saver candy colors and lots of action. It has some imaginative special effects and futuristic devices that someone actually put some thought into. Several human races and a few alien ones are represented on the screen, rather than a uniform cast of bland Americans. What is most entertaining is its vision of the far future: Gaudy, raucous, colorful, and anarchic. The look of the film borrows a bit from the Italian cinema, the Sixties, Blade Runner, and Terry Gilliam's \"Brazil,\" although it is not as inspired as any of its sources. This is in stark contrast to the dour, Germanic futures we saw in sci-fi flicks from the Fifties through the Seventies and that only started to change with Star Wars, which of course was not in the future but in the futuristic past. Bruce Willis uses his quiet persona to great effect in this film; he is the still point around which all the noisy action revolves; as Korben Dallas, he is carried along by the full-tilt action until the climactic last act, when he finally takes charge. Ian Holm is his usual great self as the nervous wreck of a priest. Gary Oldman as Zorg, the villain, is not evil, just obnoxious.",

Oldman's sufficiently over-the-top villain adds to the clich\u00e9-ridden suspense... But then Chris Turner's overly limp-wristed, flamboyant performance pushes it over into cardboard silliness. When Willis tries to \"protect\" Turner from the bad guys' weapon blasts it feels like Clint Eastwood is sheltering a cartoon - Missy Piggy, perhaps. A tragic conclusion (the last third of the film) to what might otherwise be a Grade A-minus sci-fi thriller/adventure classic. Unfortunately, Turner's interpretation plunges the film into the C-minus zone. (What was Director Besson thinking? For a compassionate and enjoyable - even realistic - look at Male Effeminism, enjoy Nathan Lane in \"The Birdcage\", released the previous year.)",

Composed with original music and an excellent soundtrack, the movie is also infused with humorous, realistically-done characters, who all have very different and distinguishable personalities. You have an exotic orange-haired heroine super- being who holds the key to the salvation of the world. Then you got a decorated classic hero with big biceps who happens to be a taxi driver, an evil guy with an accent who wears plastic on his head, a priest who has the knowledge on what the heroine is capable of, and a hilarious fast-talking radio personality wearing a tiger suit.All of these characters go into the mix in a really clever way, leading up into a very exciting climax of an incredible display of the heroine's supernatural ability, and how ultimately she and the decorated hero/flying taxi-driver fall in love.Overall, it's a very upbeat, exciting movie with a continuously engaging story that does not go limp on you at any point. It's colorful eye candy, it's a little bit sensual, it's fresh, different and funny, yet also tragic at some points, which adds depth to the movie, and an even-more rewarding sense of achievement and relief at the end.

Loving life is not born from materialism; it is the darkness of materialism that destroys the love of life. Every few thousand years, as \"The Fifth Element\" reminds us, humanity develops an obsession with material things and this evil threatens the destruction of civilisation.Fresh, bright, visually dazzling, \"The Fifth Element\" is the greatest Science Fiction Comedy of all time. Its inspirational message of love will draw tears, its uproarious humour will sap your breath from laughter, its action scenes, including the largest indoor explosion ever created for film, will have your amusement soaring.  Starring one of the most amiable stars of the century - Bruce Willis - as well as Mila Jovovich, Ian Holm, Gary Oldman, and Chris Tucker, this is one for all ages to savour. This movie is so much fun to watch that any flaws in the plot or in the editing are rendered wholly inconsequential. Its eccentric Dickens-like characters are an absolute delight, the dialogue is contagious, the soundtrack is brilliant, the international flavour the film gives with its varied races and accents rouses the heart with a glorious outlook on the future of the world,  and the special effects are so breathtaking that the movie will look good on any TV set. This is one film of which one will not tire easily after repeated viewings. \"The Fifth Element\" is a winner.",

But the fact that the story forms a parody on the genre it \"belongs\" to, made me enjoy the film even more. The most brilliant part of this film was, however, its editing. In \"The Fifth Element\" there are 3 or more brilliant scenes that made several storylines blend together. In short, The Fifth Element was FANTASTIC, and I gave it a 10.",

            "content": "The Fifth Element, directed by Luc Besson has to be one of the few movies that I can watch time and again. It is such a multi-layered movie, which works well on many levels. It is part sci-fi, part thriller, part action, part comedy but ultimately it is a love story. It is such an unusual movie, it is almost impossible to compare to any other.The story is set in the not too distant future in an incredibly crowded New York. The visuals of the city are superb, traffic drives in lanes around the skyscrapers as all the inhabitants have taken to living and working high above the city streets which are uninhabitable due to permanent, thick smog. Korben Dallas (Willis) is driving his taxi when suddenly a semi-naked woman (Milla Jovovich) who has leapt from a ledge to evade police, comes crashing into his taxi from above.The woman starts pleading with him in a totally incomprehensible language for him to help her escape. At this point, their mutual understanding of each other is the phrase \"big bad-da boom\". Korben decides to save Leeloo (a short version of her real name, Leeloo Minai Lekarariba-Laminai-Tchai Ekbat De Sebat) and soon he is off to the Pleasure Planet on a mission to save the Earth from destruction. It transpires that Leeloo is a supreme being, genetically designed to save earth, along with the elements of fire, water, air and earth. She is the Fifth Element. When these forces combine, the threat of the annihilation of earth will be over.The story moves along at a cracking pace, never letting up. It is filled with excitement and unforgettable scenes and moments. This movie offers a tremendous amount, it is visually stunning, the colours leap off the screen, the special effects are tremendous - there is just so much to marvel at. From the crowed traffic flowing in lanes around the skyscrapers, to aeroplanes that can fly at light speed, to the Phloston Paradise resort, to the robotic bartenders. The extraordinary costumes, designed by Jean Paul Gaultier, adds to the 'wow' factor of the visuals. There are explosions and fight scenes too, all of which add to the excitement.Phloston Paradise, a holiday resort in space, is the venue for a very unusual act in the form of the mysterious diva. The diva is an exotic blue alien who puts on a fantastically different operatic show, definitely one the highlights of the movie. The diva is killed just after her performance and Korben (Willis) finds the stones which represent the elements inside her. Now it is a matter of getting all the elements, plus Leeloo together and escaping from the villains (Gary Oldman as Zorg and aliens know as Mondoshawan) and Earth is safe from evil once more. All the actors do a great job. Bruce Willis is at his best playing a wise-cracking, slightly cynical part-time air cabbie who has recently retired from the military but has been drafted in to save Earth (and what better man for the job?). Gary Oldman as the baddie has never been madder than in this movie, Ian Holm plays his usual shy, bumbling, somewhat incompetent character as a priest who specialises in the Fifth Element and Chris Tucker has to be seen to be believed as the most outrageous, OTT (and often very annoying) character you will ever see. Watch out for Tricky and Lee Evans in a couple of minor roles.Milla Jovovich is the best actor in this movie, she puts in an excellent, edgy, exciting performance. How many other actresses would manage to look incredible dressed in strips of bandage with orange hair and blond roots, babbling incomprehensibly for a large part of the movie (in a 'divine' language) and yet still retain credibility and believability? Oh and boy can she kick some ass when the need arises. She manages to portray a creature of immense power, who is at the same time, very vulnerable, very human. A stunning performance from Ms Jovovich.I can't end without mentioning the humour of the film and the outstanding ending which I guarantee will have you on the edge of your seat, if not holding your breath!I think the film was so exciting and different because it didn't have the same constraints as a Hollywood movie. There was a more relaxed attitude and a greater willingness to take risks. The Fifth Element is as innovative and intriguing now as it was when first released in 1997. This movie is fun, hugely entertaining, totally different and a movie which, if you enjoy it, you will watch time and time again and never become bored with.What higher recommendation can there be than that?",

It's neither and both at the same time.  Just sit back and enjoy it, don't bother trying to rationalize.

How were they supposed to get the necessary item from the Big Blue Diva (suppose circumstances had been more pleasant?)? Other ludicrousness: Gary Oldman's hair and accent, not to mention having the Evil Planet on his speed-dial; way too much stuttering; what was that stuff on Gary Oldman's forehead (if blood, where was the wound?)?; the duck aliens taking away the artifact because WE couldn't take care of it...and the list is endless...

Overall, this film is classic. But, they really need to stop pairing young women with older men. Come on Hollywood. Now that I'm nearing 40, I realize that Milla Jovovich is exactly 20 years younger than Bruce Willis, and it kinda grosses me out. They STILL do this in movies sometimes, and nobody seems to notice. WTH? And for the comments on Milla's appearance, gag me some more. That's not the point of the movie, people. I guess they expected her to be an actual \"perfect being\"? Somebody please explain this to me. Do people realize how creepy their critique is?Anyway, The Fifth Element is definitely dated, but plenty of sci fi and old movies with cheesy effects still have value. It is original and funny, while still being campy and classic 90s action. Despite being too old to be a love interest to Milla, Willis is funny and perfect in this role. I do catch more details now than I did back then. There was a lot of thought that went into this stylish futuristic world, and it seems to have either affected or accurately predicted many trends. When this was new, the outfits, makeup and hairstyles were pretty out there, but now it seems almost under done. The futurism reminds me of my favorite show ever, Futurama.

It manages to be a starkly fresh and original semi-scifi movie with too much individual character to really belong to any established genre. It works as a stark social commentary and as a homage to the human spirit.300 years into the future, we find that the world has got a lot more bigger, populated and technologically advanced. That's all that's changed. People have not changed in the slightest; there's still war, crime, abuse of power etcetera etcetera. Hell, even McDonald's is still around AND doing good. One has to wonder if these are Besson's own dark predictions for the future, far darker than those of Gene Roddenberry. On the other hand, and interestingly, the radio is just as big as television in this future.Visually, this film is spectacular. The set pieces are out of this world, the whole look utterly characteristic. All costumes were designed by Jean-Paul Gaultiere, and his creativity ties it all together. This is evidently a world far in the future.The story is a big one, yet never feels unsatisfactorily told. Corben Dallas (Bruce Willis) is a retired space fighter turned cab driver who's just a hair's breadth from losing his job. Mysterious girl Leeloo literally falls into his life, turning out to be the mysterious and precious Fifth Element, a super-being meant to complete the quintet forming a world-saving weapon from an unspeakable evil. To make matters difficult is corrupted mogul Zorg (Gary Oldman once again displaying his extraordinary versatility), who has a pact with this unspoken evil, or \"Mr. Shadow\" as Zorg knows him. These two parties (Corben and Leeloo with priest Vito Cornelius) race against each other to find the four \"elements\", in four stones. To give away any more would spoil things, but I guarantee you'll be entertained.All the performances are great. Milla Jovovich was made for the part of Leeloo (perhaps not a coincidence, seeing how she was married to Besson at the time), to such an extent that to this day, Leeloo's visage pops in my mind whenever the actress's name is mentioned. Chris Tucker is ridiculously funny and over-the-top as radio sensation Ruby Rhod. You have to hand it to him, it takes balls to strut around in the costumes he wears and keep it believable. When he panics, however, he is even funnier, completely hyper and screaming in ways I previously thought weren't possible by male vocal chords. One particularly hilarious performance, though, isn't even credited; that of Corben's mother. We only hear her speak on the phone, but her dry, sharp and non-humoured dialogue leaves me in stitches. It's a real pity the actress behind the voice is unknown, because it takes something for a voice-only performance to stick out this much in your mind after viewing. To put it plainly, this film is hilarious. All the humour is imaginative and well-delivered. It goes into sexual territory at times, but never anything rancid. That's good comedy. The Fifth Element is not a comedy, though. It's a visual, engaging action adventure.I love how Luc Besson's films always have this certain character to them, and this just might be his most reconisable film (and the man has made some great stuff, such as L\u00e9on). Great piece of entertainment, as beautiful as it is exciting. It's also fun to see a more cynical view on the future. The Fifth Element is one of those times we are reminded that vision and entertainment can be perfect bed partners.",

I'll start off talking about the plot of the film. The beginning of this movie isn't confusing, but it jumps around between a lot of time periods/plot lines and it's kind of annoying. I think the entire opening scene probably could've been cut. For the most part, the general story and themes aren't anything new but it's presented in a very unique way. The characters are honestly pretty interesting with some great relationships within here. The visuals here look great a lot of times, but other times some costumes look clunky and the CGI isn't very good. The performances are all solid with some, once again, very weird things going on. The soundtrack can be a bit much at times but most of the time everything sounds good and matches the setting. Overall, it's a fun, simple, but very weird film that has a solid atmosphere and was incredibly charming. 7.5/10.",

A welcomed change from the dark trashiness that has been watered down and done to death.The story is a pretty original. The editing is particularly good. Pay attention to the ends of scenes, because what ever was talked about in the end of a scene is exactly what the next scene is. The impact this has on the energy of the film is easy to overlook and disregard as obvious.The effects are of course good. They should be considering how many effects houses worked on it and how much this film cost.The acting is good. Bruce Willis is of course Bruce Willis. Gary Oldman is as usual a pleasure to watch. That little piece of plastic on his head is annoying though. I suppose it was put there to make him look silly. However he already looked kinda  weird without his patented evil man goatee.I would say the worst part and completely unnecessary and out of place part of this film is Chris Rock's character. Oh was he annoying. He runs toe to toe with Jar Jar Binks as worst character to almost ruin a movie.I don't know why Luc Besson put him in there. Maybe to poke fun at Americans. All it does is once that overt reference is gone (about five seconds after appears) is leave us with an annoying and overbearing character you just wish would die in a crossfire.Take him away and some other out of place cheesiness (like that stupid creature in Gary Oldman's desk) and you have a perfect movie.So if you want a near perfect sci-fi/action/comedy movie and can handle these sometimes annoying imperfections rent or buy this.Not exactly thinking man's sci-fi, but neither were most of the Star Wars movies.I would equate this with Episode I.

I accept that not all movies will not have great female and POC characters, but to use Star Wars (which is older than this movie) as an example, the female and POC characters in SW are not perfect, but still not entirely offensive to the point that the movie is unwatchable.

It's like I felt in love with this movie, of course exaggerating things. It is so perfectly done and I would say that is just as perfect as Leeloo (Milla Jovovich)is, the Fifth element itself. It is the colors, the situations, the picture, the amazing future that Luc Besson made up for us to see, the music (Eric Serra), the sounds, everything. It's like a dream (and I really mean a dream of those we have once in a while and makes us think we a going crazy) come true. It's like one of those works of art that will always have a place in a famous museum. At least that is was it comes to my mind when I think about The Fifth Element, and I know some of this days I'll find my self watching it again. Note: There is always something similar in Luc Besson's female characters, if you see some of his other movies you will know what I'm talking about. He makes all of his female characters appear to be wild regarding to their feelings, they are all very full of emotions, seems like they always feel twice as we do and that is really attractive.",

Approach it with an open mind (i.e. one with little brain) and enjoy.Milla Jovovich is the supreme being, the fifth element. She has been sent to earth to save humankind from a deathstar like thing of utter evil. However, when she falls into the back of ex-military man's Bruce Willis' cab, he has no idea. Thus the story spirals out of control (in more ways than one) encompassing everything from Chris Rock's deranged radio host to an alien opera singer with stones in her body. This is pure, mad escapism.\nLuc Besson's film is mulitcoloured, theatrical, commercial, eccentric, bizarre yet cliched and ever so slightly scary. Its obviously a total mess, but thats what makes it all the more fun. On the one hand, you've got a happy ending, plenty of flesh on display,numerous action sequences and the token black guy but on the other you've got costumes designed by Jean Paul Gautier, a bizarre pop/dance/comedy soundtrack and Ian Holm.A contradiction of a movie, and all the better for it, The Fifth Element is what happens when a Hollywood studio goes European.

The story forwards many centuries and we are suddenly transported to a future full of lively colors and fast action. Fifth Element looks great and the special effects saturation hadn't set in back then yet, as it has now so there is that sense of visual wonder. But the screenplay lacks consistency and the fast-paced action can only hold your attention so much. Bruce Willis plays the Taxi Driver, assigned with assisting the fifth element- which happens to be a human being, Milla Jovovich. Unlike John Mclane however he is content to stay low key in this one possible future. Jovovich is alright and Chris Rock is rather annoying, even though he isn't even there all that much. Watch The fifth element to get dazzled by the special effects and the futuristic world build by Luc Besson, because that is pretty much all the film has to offer.",

Chris Tucker(Ruby Rhod) was kind of annoying but he had his times of importance and was a good light-hearted addition to the movie.Of course who can resist the Diva Plavalaguna(Ma\u00efwenn Le Besco. Music by Gaetano Donizetti)? Her enchanting song played well with the more up-beat music that choreographs(right word?) well with the fight. The 45 second or so segment of the Diva was to short even though she did play an important roll (carrying the stones).Milla Jovovich(Leeloo) is one of my favorite actresses (along with Michelle Rodriguez in Resident Evil 2002).

Now, that evil force has returned and the world must be protected. Evil, however, has other plans; with the greedy interference of a self-centred entrepreneur (played by Gary Oldman), Evil manages to all but destroy humanities only hope.

Maniacal villian?  Sure, Besson has Gary Oldman's number on his speed-dial for that part, check. Unstoppable alien menace?  Check.  Love conquers all in the end?  Stop, that was a rhetorical question.  (But the film insists on answering it.)Apologists for this film insist that it wasn't meant to be taken seriously, which would be to mistake narrative laziness for intentional satire even if it didn't reek of post-debacle spin.  It's quite possible to tell a feather-light and even silly story without insulting your audience at every turn, a task accomplished by films as diverse as \"Babe\",  \"There's Something About Mary\", and even \"Star Wars\", which T5E apes shamelessly without ever displaying any awareness about why it worked as a film.Just about the only redeeming factors in The Fifth Element are the stunning visual effects by Digital Domain, and the gleefully outre costume design by Jean-Paul Gaultier.  But they in no way make up for the cringeworthy dialogue, the terrible acting, the overbearing soundtrack and the stunningly contrived plot.  About the only way to derive any real enjoyment out of this film is to turn the volume down to zero, and at that point why bother?",

So you either LOVE it or HATE it, there's no in between.But it just rocks!! Awesome special effects, awesome sounds, awesome music, awesome actors, and awesomly entertaining.It's so much FUN to watch, who wants to watch another plane crash or another FBI film, how boring. Not the 5th Element, giving you a colourful, exciting look at New York of the future. It's funny as well, especially the futuristic DJ played well by Chris Tucker. The whole movie takes you for a fun, exciting, 'enjoyable' ride as you watch Bruce Willis and the beautiful Milla Jovovich save the world. A 'must see' for anyone who wants to be entertained, and that's what it's all about, being entertained.**Brilliant 10/10**",

            "content": "As a public service, I'm reviewing this film 20 years after watching it. There are some negative reviews of this film that need to be rebutted!At the time this film came out, many didn't \"get it\". It was a sci-fi action romp that seemed to make no sense with ridiculous characters. A villain who has a southern accent. An absurd idea of 4 elements + a fifth stopping a black hole. Over the top costumes and lines. But it was MEANT to be that way. What came across as silly was French and European movie style. Some don't \"get it\". Here's how to understand:In this bright, but dismal world (much like today where you can find beauty mixed in with poverty), there's flying cars, magical machines that make rotisserie chicken out of pellets, makeup applicators you put on your eyes like a sleeping mask, and Chinese food delivered by a guy to your window. Oh, and a cigarette dispenser and a shower that doubles as a refrigerator and closet. It's the journey that was all about fun but it all kind of made sense: Save the world. The characters were perfectly cast for what they did. Yes, Bruce Willis is obviously typecast as a future cabby/ex-cop but that's what he does well. Leeloo/Jovovich is a supermodel with brains who is simultaneously likable and feminine despite the worst hairdoo ever. The action sequences were good for the time and fun and also had a lot of humor. You even can like the villain Zorg with his interesting take on destruction that ought to be part of an economics class. There were hundreds of moving parts including Chris Tucker acting with Willis that shouldn't have worked, but did. There was a lot of room to have fun and for those viewers who wanted to have fun, they did. Some didn't. And that's OK.",

            "content": "Basically this film can be split into two parts; A bloody brilliant on-a-par-with-star-wars first half. And A bloody awful pointless plotless second half.I had been told this film was awful.  During the first hour, i thought, no this is ace. the sixties b-movie sort of futuristic look was done perfectly, the comedy moments were there, some blinding special effects sequences.  There was loads of imagination, such as the chinese food stall/flying boat thingy, the weapons etc... But what tied it all together was the plot.  OK, I didn't know why this big ball of fire came from that was threatening the Earth, i did not care, i was enjoying the film too much to really think about this.  And while not amazing, the plot wa interesting - i wanted to know what happened.  I honestly expected it to be one of my favourite films ever at this point.But no.  If you have not seen the film as yet, then when they Earth on this mission, turn it off.  Please.  You would be better just imagine what happens.  It would be better than the reality.In short, there is a fight lasting 40 odd minutes, a totally corny ending where 'love' saves the Earth, the most unsubtle point about war ever (ie. lass sits in front of some images of war, then cries).  I had no idea at all what was going on in the fight sequence, and when the big evil alien geezer got killed, i thought 'is that it? Shouldnt it be a bit more dramatic when a important character is killed?' The plot has been utterly forgotten to fit in special effects.  They took away the quality scenery of the first half, replacing it with tripe. There is even an annoying bloke like Jar-Jar Binks (in fact i think it is the same bloke) chucked in for good measure, as if it wasn't bad enough at this point.I was utterly peeved off with this film.  I cant believe Besson messed this up.  Stick with the ideas in the first half, you have one of the best films ever.  Do what Besson did and you end up with a disappointing pile of excrement.",

Only good thing is the beginning of movie (scenes in Egypt). Oh yes the acting of old professor and Luke Perry was good and because it was good they got only ca 10min.

The hammy and overrated Gary Oldman plays his usual cheeseball villain in a collection of affected mannerisms and expressions, while Willis' hero (well, sort of) falls into one weird (but pretty) situation after another.  In its favor, the movie gives you a whole other world of imagination.  In its disfavor, the world it shows you makes little sense and is a bit over-designed.  Usual \"chosen-one-must-save-the-world\" plot we've been forced to watch in SF and fantasy for the past 25 years (can you say \"pyrotechnic special effects finale?\"); tune out the plot and dialogue but stay for the cool designs (and the funny-looking ones, too)!",

An offensive amount of very dated CGI, hideously miscast characters, stupid character design in some cases, oh so many failed attempts at humour alongside genuinely humourous actors who aren't properly utilised for comedy in the film, forced & contrived love between the obvious breeding pair, the main character's mother keeps calling in the film which feels long every time and is never funny, and overall it's just a very dumb, unfunny, boring & predictable misfire of a movie.\nHowever, many of the set designs are pretty awesome, SOME of the CGI was very good for it's time, Gary Oldman never fails to disappoint (even in this garbage movie) and the design of the Mangalores is pretty awesome too.\nI won't ever be watching this again.",

Makes you want to go back to the 90s when some passionate crew masterfully crafted something that today's producers can't dream to do with all their advanced CGI and big budgets.A lengthy run time of 2 hours gave the director Luc Besson enough room for character development which he did. Personally I loved the fact that the extras did a great job level with big names like Bruce Willis & Garry Oldman.My only complaint which to be fair is a legally big one is the movie's absurd editing and lack of a genuine soundtrack, which despite all its positive features blew away the entire project and failed to shed light on and draw attention to its foremost important scenes to tag along the viewer.Could have been a 9/10 but..",

            "content": "I had seen only two of Besson's past films when I rented this one. La Femme Nikita and The Professional I found thoroughly enjoyable, but The Fifth Element was just more clich\u00e9-ridden American celluloid.Now, I was looking for something specific. In both Nikita and Professional, Besson employed delightfully flawed main characters. Does Nikita deserve the mind-twisting manipulation she's enduring? She's a victim of ruthless and calculating people, but on the other hand she's a cold-blooded bitch killer. Do I like L\u00e9on? He's a sympathetic, child-like man, but on the other hand he's an efficient executioner. I find myself thinking about these two often: they raise questions about what I feel about the world and why.All of the characters in The Fifth Element were stock items. Bruce Willis played, once again, Bruce Willis. I liked Moonlighting and Die Hard but how many times can he play David Addison in yet another movie and have it continue to work? Gary Oldman was rehashing Norman Stansfield from The Professional with minor adjustments. The rest of the movie amounted to nothing more than a giant treasure hunt and chase scene, culminating in too many gender clich\u00e9s to count and a sickeningly sweet monologue on the nature of love. The whole effort left me cold.Now, if you don't make the connection with Besson's earlier films, and you just want to see a bit of fun, over-the-top science fiction fluff, then The Fifth Element may be for you. If, like me, you enjoyed Besson's earlier complex characters and are looking for more of the same, then avoid this one like the plague.",

Picture the hybrid of Star Wars, Indiana Jones, and (double-YUCK) Austin powers.  Think about it.  Intrigued?An ordinary guy with an extraordinary past meets up with the perfect girl and a priest of an ancient order, to defeat the essence of darkness intangible, set on a collision course for their world to destroy all life. All the characters in this movie fill in a niche resulting in defeating evil.  Like life, the individuals do not work together, but in the end everything works out (or does it) in a way in which one would wonder could it have been done any other way.  It seems that fate directs humanity (it's evils, lusts, carnage, greed, anger, and most of all innocence) too defeat evil as a whole, even though most are not working towards that goal, and even oblivious to the ramifications.The problem with this movie is that the producers tried to cram in too many elements; comedy, action, love, thought provoking concepts, wacky spin, and Wild West type hero...  Instead of being a top 10 movie with just a few elements, what resulted was a C movie in a class all it's own.  Although, after watching it two nights in a row, I admit I am disappointed in how it turned out.  It could have been in league with 12 Monkeys, yet it is worth watching despite it's bane just to try to understand the effort at genius.Simple plot, carried out with taste, remarkably enter twined from different angles.  Although it falls short of the mark, respect the effort at genius. Watch this movie of simple entertainment, good special effects, and a coy attitude between the lines that makes me think...

A simple good-vs-evil tale told with humour, stylish costumes, sharp direction and great effects.I am going to stick my neck out here, and say it's the best \"fun\" Sci-Fi Movie ever made - taking on the likes of Star Wars, Star Trek, Battlestar Gallaticar, and knocking them into a cocked Stormtroopers Helmet. With it's U.K. 15 Certificate, it is able to explore more mature themes - so perhaps this is its appeal when comparing it against standard \"bubble-gum\" Sci-Fi flicks.It's beautifully filmed, with eye-popping colours, sets and costumes by Jean-Paul Gaultier. Nearly all the costumes are fun and widely impractical, allowing Gaultier to squeeze muscle-bound extras into Lycra shorts for some mild homo-erotic images. Milla Jovovich (Leeloo) gets carefully placed 2 inch straps as a costume to jump off buildings with, for the heterosexuals in the audience. The humour ranges from slap-stick with Lee Evans, black with Gary Oldman, subtle with Ian Holm and deadpan with Bruce Willis. I think it's this that really makes the film - it will just not take it's self seriously, but still delivers tension and conflict. Oldman showing off his latest multi-function ZF-1 gun is just a cinemagraphic treat - with real punch on the effects and treacle dialogue delivery from Oldman. \"A word on firepower. Three thousand round clip with bursts of 3 to 300. With the Replay button (another Zorg invention) it's even easier. One shot, and Replay sends every following shot to the same location\".Luc Besson is not worried about using character actors for most of the smaller parts - so the screen is filled with a superb looking supporting cast, rather than the \"bland\" model-look-alike extras in most films. Some of the lighting and effects emphasise this aspect, which makes for great viewing, and adds realism to the experience - as most scientists will probably not look like Male Fashion Models!I suppose the only flaw in the film is the simplistic story-line. It is almost childish in its concept, but gets such a superb cinematic treatment, I can forgive this - and get on with enjoying what it has to offer.It's up there with the Sci-Fi greats, head-and-shoulders above most of them - so make a date with a Pop-Culture Classic, and then get it voted into the Top 50 - for heaven's sake....",

It has an over-the-top cartoon like quality that makes the unrealistic nature of the film easy to take.The plot is contrived and trite.  It's B-grade to say the least.  But this film isn't about plot, it's about presentation, and in that respect it's a great success.  Visually the film is very bold and risky.  Bright colors and skimpy costumes abound.  Bruce Willis forsakes his white action vest for a bright orange one.  Milla Jovovich parades around in nothing but carefully applied bandages.  The film looks and sounds LOUD!The film is also very very funny at times.  It's constantly poking fun at itself.The acting is mostly good.  There is a fine line between great Bruce Willis and terrible Bruce Willis, and here he is great.  He isn't really the dominating leading man like in most of his films, here there are many important characters.  Gary Oldman is funny but barely used as the villain.  The always reliable Ian Holm delivers yet again.  Chris Tucker's radio show is appalling, but he is funny when running around screaming during the action segments.The real star though is Milla Jovovich.  She totally steals the movie.  She is so completely perfect and so gorgeous that you can't help but fall for her.  She shines above the material.  She manages to inject her mostly jibberish dialogue with so much warmth, humour and irony.  Her entire screen presence is captivating.  If I had my way, she would have won a best supporting actress Oscar, but of course the academy would never be so daring.I often read what a bad year for 'big summer' films 1997 was.  But I disagree totally.  With the action packed Face/Off and Con Air, the campy cartoon fun of The Fifth Element and Batman and Robin and the antics of the Men in Black, it was a great year for blockbusters.  Certainly much better than 1998's dreary bunch.8/10 - Loads of fun.  The self parody makes up for a few dicey moments.",

D) Brion James - He is a character actor and a great goofy General trying his best.E) Zeus aka Tommy 'Tiny' Lister - President of the World (coolness).F) Gary Oldman - Zorg, great name for a villain. I still add him to this even though he hated the movie. G) Chris Tucker was Chris Tucker. He acted the best, and only way he knows although the up shot is that his style was sync with the overall speed of the story and led to the uncomfortable \"making love\" scene (but funny), which one day I might get a question about from my child. 2) I loved this movie the colors are vibrant and pleasant to the viewers eyes which went well with the \"space opera.\" 3) The operatic battle scene between Leeloo vs.Mangaloren and the blue alien singing. 4) Parts that were awesome: Flying Cars, Blue Blood, A big ball of evil, the demise of Luke Perry, Chinese Food delivered & made in front of you,Motherly Guilt, the name Zorg, Tricky, etc....5) I added the spoiler thing because I did not know if Luke Perry's demise was key part to the development of the plot.",

An exception here would be Terminator 2, but that movie is much more intended to make you as trigger-happy as possible. \"The fifth element\", on the other hand, is more just a marvelous computer-effects movie made to made you laugh, cry where applicable, and fall in love momentarily with the all the down-to-earth characters, no matter how much the plot tries to convince us otherwise.My favorite thing about this movie, the fact that makes it peasant to watch over and over, is that despite of it being a sci-fi, there are no scenes in it at all that can typically give us a bad stomach, bring us nightmares, and just typically mess with our heads more than we would willfully allow them. The strategies used to prove this movie to be set in the year 2214 (not 2300) are the out-of-this-world car designs, appartment designs, airport designs, the flying ship-looking machines that come to your home to bring you food, and the clothing designs. Some of these may be a big extreme, but they are accompanied by very good humor, letting the audience know they are meant as a joke. In addition to that, the directing job for this movie is simply perfectuous (hope that's a word). Every scene is edited not too long, not too short. We're never for a second left hanging on unanswered questions or dull moments. Sometimes the plot thinkens and gets a bit confusing, but all the dialogues are done not too seriously, so the viewer knows that even if he or she misses the \"main point\", there will still be enough camera tricks and effects to explain and fulfill the final movie effect by the director. That's why this movie stands out so much for me. And, last but not least, Milla Jovovich... This girl had acted so simply and \"without a care in the world\", that I actually believed she was seeing everything for the first time. Not mentioning her great charm and beauty, she had kept us on the edge of our seats just by the little smirks and voice inflections (again, hope that's a word) she used to be something other than human. The first time I saw her smiling like that I had a feeling she was in some way different at nature than other actresses I've seen trying to accomplish that kind of charm, but never getting there. Then I went online and found out she's from Kiev, Ukraine. Just FYI. Anyways, this movie is worth watching for everyone, especially if you like fight scenes but don't prefer seing people being sliced in half with their insides falling out (like in Ghost Ship). If you want a good thriller that will make you all jolly on the inside instead of disturbed, this may be your only answer out on the Hollywood market right now.",

The cast brings life to their characters.  Bruce Willis easily fell into his role as Korben Dallas, so well that it did not seem like you were watching Bruce Willis.  Milla Jovovich was awesome as the Perfect creature in the universe, Ian Holm was realistic, Chris Tucker was annoying but hilarious (Bzzzzz! is classic to sci-fi fans) and Gary Oldman just totally hysterical as Zorg.People might think that the characters and the setting is taken straight from comic book pages.  In a way it is, but in other ways it resembles our Earth.  Like Dune and the old Star Wars Trilogy, it paints for us a surreal picture of civilization (in this case ours in the near future) in a way the new Star Wars films fail to achieve.  The costuming, the designs for the hovering cars, the Paradise Planet, the so-called 'celebrities' of the time, and the Diva concert all add to a unique and odd culture that keeps the movie going in the blurry spots on the plot.  The aliens are different from your average sci-fi movie aliens, and the techno music score is sweet.The plot is simple and not too original, but it does keep you going most of the time.  Admittedly, the beginning is pretty boring and it might take some effort to keep non-sci-fi fans in their seats.  But otherwise, the story is fun and the script is loaded with laughs.I rate this 9.5 out of 10.  Go out and buy on DVD or VHS.  This is definitely one of the better examples of sci-fi.",

It isn't artistic cinema ; rather a comic containing all the elements that make a smashing picture. Besson is one of my favourites, and again he didn't dissapoint me. \"The Fifth Element\" is not as marvellous as \"Leon\" but is an example of a well done job, dynamic and entertaining, quite intelligent in its lack of seriousness and director's distance to it. Its just a Besson's childhood dream made into a feature.What I like most about this film are the actors; Willis didn't show anything new, but was in good shape , Ian Holm was brilliant as an overexcited priest of 25th century , my favourite actor Gary Oldman once again proved that any role is suitable for him (his performance was brilliant , a villain with a British sense of humour, and a Nicholson-like character) and obviously Milla Jovovich (I was really surprised, I didn't expect her being so talented).The rest was almost as good. The story had some holes, but as I said (wrote) before it's not an artistic cinema. I loved the director's vision of the 25th century world, and all the costumes by Gaultier (although generally I hate the guy and the stuff he designs), both very bright and colourful as well as a bit tasteless (in positive meaning of the word).All in all I'd give it 8.5 if I could but in that case....... strong 8/10.",

            "content": "Let me begin by simply saying, \"I love this movie!\"  With a stellar cast (Bruce Willis, Milla Jovovich, Ian Holm, the late Brion James, Chris Tucker, and last, but never EVER least, Gary Oldman), a wonderful, action-packed, funny story, with just the right amount of \"let's straighten up our act before we wipe out mankind\" sermonizing, I never tire of this movie.  I've probably seen it over 100 times and never fail to find some little gem that I missed the time before, and the time before that, and so on.Bruce Willis is at his best as the reluctant hero, a futuristic Joe Everyman whose future is changed when a woman drops into his life and changes the course of history.  Willis is always best when he's able to be his usual wry, sarcastic self, and Luc Besson blesses us with a story which utilizes this to it's full potential.  Milla Jovovich is delightfully innocent as our supreme-being-in-the-making, Ian Holm is surprisingly funny as the priest, and Chris Tucker is his usual screamingly hilarious self.  Before seeing \"The Fifth Element\" for the first time in 1997 I was not familiar with any of Chris Tucker's other work, so this was my first introduction to his rapid-fire dialogue and campy hamming.  I cannot think of anyone else who can talk as fast as he can and still be understandable.  And funny.  Gary Oldman tops it all off with a generous helping of his patented creepy villian, which I can never get enough of.Luc Besson's story is full of action, adventure, comedy, romance, enough-but-not-too-much silliness, and just an all-around sense of fun.  The only fault I did find with the entire movie was the mother of Bruce Willis' character hounding him for no apparent reason.  What in the world was the reason for this?  But it is only a minor distraction in an otherwise fabulous movie.  I would recommend this *very* highly and give it a 10 out of 10 stars. Settle in and get ready for a highly entertaining and enjoyable ride!",

Besson's skill at picking the actors and dressing them up in a certain way to change the impact of their role is probably second to none and so many sequences in this movie are real ground breaking artistic and conceptual amalgamations that work on many levels. Comedy, passion and intelligence are rife in this film at every step, with the chemistry of leeloo and korbin as well as cornelius, rhuby and zorg with some wonderfully edited scenes to throw them all together. Watch out for schematic and visual ideas that went on to be a big part of 'the matrix' films.",

            "review_title": "The Fifth Element",
            "content": "The Fifth Element is a classic movie somehow. On the surface, it appears, and even on a first watch could easily be dismissed as a Big Dumb Action movie with sexy half naked women, generic one noted protagonist, and a larger then life action plot and set pieces. However, if someone earned a position as not just a cult classic but a classic sci-fi movie in general, beloved by a lot of critics and mainstream audiences, the movie has gotten its share of criticism for its overly simplistic and formulaic action design.Others cite it as a marvelous sci-fi thriller with secret anti-capitalist and anti-corpatist thoughts, environmental messaging, messes about connection, nature, masculinity, and even humanity. The choice to make Mr. Zorg, the man who owns the Taxi company the lead drives for the villain hell bent on destroying the earth is often cited as a strong bit of evidence, as well as the fact that Korben Dallas never meets Zorg that factors into this narrative of grand story telling about the face of the faceless corporatocracy, some critics agree, others think this narrative is just art students looking to analyze to get some value from their degree.I, however, in my infinite wisdom would say, the Fifth Element is both. Or at least has massive elements of both. The Fifth Element is an undeniably over the top and goofy sci-fi action movie with light fantasy elements, this is completely undeniably. However, just under the performance by Bruce Willis as Dallas, there is a rather strong narrative and plot line. It just takes a moment longer to see it.On a broader surface level there is a clear \"Strong men make good times, good times make weak men, weak men make bad times, bad times make strong men...\" vibe with Bruce Willis's character feeling and acting like a relic of a time before the happening of the movie, ancient, very traditionally male and yet needed to overcome the bad times that are now there. Most other male characters have a far more complex relationship with masculinity, and I think that is an interesting topic to think about. Chris Tucker, playing himself under the name Ruby Rhod, is a prime example of this. In a popular discussion about TOXIC MASCULINITY, these two characters foil each other quite well. Dallas is good natured, willing to self-sacrifice, and overall both physically and emotionally strong and fit. Very positive traits that are often seen as Male responsibilities, and yet, he shares almost all of them with the female lead of Milla Jovovich as Leeloo.Whereas in stark contrast, Ruby starts the movie having an overwhelming number of traits associated with masculinity that are toxic while being anything but traditionally masculine. Ruby is vein, arrogant, whiny, dare I say, a bimbo of a man. He isn't a character that holds either great emotional or physical strength. He does get some spotlight and his character is explored, and even when push comes to shove, he shows he can do the hard tasks needed to survive and help others, he just... whines a lot.It is interesting, you mix in Zorg, another very untraditionally masculine character, he is also vain, a touch arrogant, but he is stoic-presenting, and exercises control in a lot of his scenes. Honestly, despite not having a lot of screen time Gary Oldman owned and mastered the role. Both over the top and natural feeling in the setting, relying on tools and weapons and wealth to act as strength where he lacked it. And in the end not fearing doing the actions he deemed required for his goals. These make up the three male main characters, and I think without pushing more heavily into it, I think they do a really interesting job of exploring the ideas of masculinity in the modern context, and traditional strength and traditional tasks when the movie first came out. As far as the topic of things like Gender Roles, Toxic Masculinity, and Emotional Availability in Men goes, there is a well to analysis here even if not fully intentional.The next major subtext in the movie, in my opinion, and becomes very highly highlighted at the climax is of course the five elements, and what they mean for humanity. The first four are easy and obvious, Fire, Water, Earth, and Air. The four fundamental elements of the world in most media. However, just like the planeteers of Captain Planet, there is a fifth element. Ultimately the four fundamental elements illustrate a minor point about humanity's ability to control the elements for their own well being, while the fifth element is what makes them human. I'll touch more on that in Spoiler town.Another element that I don't think the Fifth Element started, but I think was helped popularize by the Fifth Element was the abundance of noodles and china / south asian style apartments and sprawling cities. Like the use of both elements in the Space Western Firefly, it can be seen in the Fifth Element long before it, and admittedly to a lesser degree, but it does peak up. It also hints to a look at the Fifth Element being strongly ameri-centric while also having global ideas, and presenting a world that was a united globe (and galactic because sci-fi, but it ultimately is about showing a unified and connected world under one or more collective ideas and ideologies. In the Fifth Element that is largely hinted at a multi-planet government, Zorg's company, and a blend of over the top clashing caste of people.There is a powerful anti-corporate and anti-capitalist message in there as well, even if it isn't on the surface, much like shows like Cowboy Bebop, it is more focused on presenting then preaching, it is making the attempt to express and show the flaw and pitfalls. Such as Dallas having to pay for miles, to drive his cab, to get money to pay for miles. Of course, this can also be seen as a mocking of government regulation and intertwining into markets as well.All in all The Fifth Element has a far deeper movie inside of it, then it shows on the surface and that is by design, it is to lure people in with the lackluster everyman charisma of Bruce Willis, keep their butts in the seats for the actions scenes, and explore other parts of value and story at the same time.Overall: 7/10Spoiler Stuff\nThe Fifth Element is love you ding-dongs! The most human thing ever. It is how we connect and interact and how you propagate, and why we do things for selfishness. Love, and by proxy connection are the most human things ever.There is a thing to be said about connection, in the Movie, our hero is connected to everyone. He is with Leeloo, he meets the priests, Ruby is his 'friend'. Zorg is his boss. He connects. Zorg, our lead villain, doesn't. He never meets most of the named characters, and isn't even aware of his connection to Dallas. He is without real connection, without love to the world around him.The move presents love as both the romantic and sexual kind, but it is more broad then that, and you can tell by the inclusion of the priests in the context of the narrative. They are vaguely catholic in attire, implying some of the catholic positions on sex and romance, yet they embrace love. Which shows it means love, not specifically romantic, but all love, familial, romantic, platonic.This movie is old enough that it feels like I don't really need to go over much in terms of the actual spoiler as it seems like, at least to me, everyone is mostly aware of the movie. Yet I wanted to put this sort of section behind it cause I think a bit part of experiencing this movie in particular is this hypothesis on connection.",

Bruce Willis is cool. But, as a male, let me tell you the director's idea of a perfect woman is not my idea of a perfect woman. And before you decide that I'm just a pig and obviously her perfection was much deeper and who am I to be judging a woman by her appearance (which I am), let me point out how everybody in the movie, from military commanders to a monk of some bizarre religious sect, acknowledges how beautiful he thinks she is. Me... I thought she looked like a typical anorexic European model, but with unnaturally vivid hair.\n-SPOILERS AHEAD-\nUnfortunately, what will probably strike most people about the movie are the nauseatingly trite themes of love and pacifism. She can save the human race from annihilation, but, alas! she ponders, is there anything worth saving? You see, all we do is nuke each other, according to the Ken Burns series she watches on a spaceship. Oh, but fear not! Despite our affinity for brinkmanship, since she fell in love with Bruce Willis we're not so bad and she'll save humanity after all. It's good to know that love can still override the better judgment of a woman if the fate of the world is on the line.Come to think of it, even though I praised the art direction, I remembered something about the look of the movie that disagreed with me: Chris Tucker. If you have seen the movie, you realized that the only thing more insufferable than Tucker's hair and clothing is his persona, which reaches new depths of cosmic annoyingness--annoyingness that would make you want to call up Jar Jar just to get away from such whiny, effeminate prattle.The movie could have been really great. But the annoyingly French message will probably turn off anyone who pays attention. Let's say 5/10 because blue is always in fashion.",

The Fifth Element uses one of the newest tricks in the science fiction motion picture handbook: perform a visual and aural assault on viewers in the vain hope that they won't notice the lack of substance, logic, and intelligence. For a few recent examples of where this tactic has been employed, check out Stargate and Independence Day. The Fifth Element, the summer of 1997's first big-budget disappointment, is right at home in such company. A lot of money was spent on this film, but $100 million doesn't guarantee a good product. Maybe someone should have thought of spending a few more dollars on a better script. Once The Fifth Element's assault on the senses starts to wear off, it's easy to become restless. After all, in keeping with the \"epic\" sweep demanded by such an obese budget, the film had to clock in at over two hours, even though there's no excuse for a movie with so little going on to last for so long.",

I expected much more from this movie but felt disappointed. Maybe it's the fact that I watched it for the very first time on 2012; but then again, a very-good movie is good independently from its time. Gary Oldman is great, Bruce Willis is Bruce Willis and Milla fits perfectly in her role. The rest of the cast is at the same level of this movie-- their dialogues and personalities don't seem to have any other purpose than to portrait worn out characters from played-out stories. I won't try to argue any further that the movie is bad, this is just my opinion, but I feel it is impossible to rate this movie a 10 from any perspective.

I had no trouble following the plot, what there was of one, but I never believed in the motivations of the characters.  Some of the characters and their motivations were obviously not intended to be taken seriously, but I never could believe in the love between the principals, even though that was supposed to be what was saving the universe.  The only character who involved me was the Diva, and she was a minor character who appeared in too few scenes.  Also, maybe I missed something somewhere, but why was a person (Leeloo) who supposedly knew nothing of Earth's languages and cultures able to start sounding out and understanding words simply by seeing some writing? And if she started out understanding writing, why couldn't she start out knowing how to pronounce?I think it's worth the price of rental to see this movie, but I would not purchase a copy.  However, the soundtrack is worth having.  Except for the annoying bonus track (Thanks for the extra, guys!) the music is haunting and evocative.

And all that business of 'love conquering all' was weak, flimsy and sickening.Secondly the, mise-en-scene was atrocious, in particular the costume and setting.  The visuals seem to have been directly stolen from Blade Runner, albeit very badly and losing the dark, gritty essence of Ridley Scott's vision.  I mean, Jean-Paul Gaultier? For Pete's sake!  The barrage of colour on-screen was just plain sickening, at best an eyesore.  And those awful and wholly unconvincing aliens; were they on lease from the Dr. Who studio or what?  In its favour, I have to say some of the exterior settings were executed fairly well, but still very much over the top and ultimately a cheap Blade Runner pastiche.The acting was also unforgivable, Bruce Willis being the best there, which says a lot for the quality of the supporting cast.  Gary Oldman, typically a decent performer, was criminally miscast, the British actors were absolutely terrible and very much out of place, and Chris Tucker.well the less said about that clown the better. It appears he has the unique ability of ruining even the most ghastly and humourless of films.Ahh, yes, the 'humour' which this marvellous film attempted to cram into its genre-busting cocktail like an unwilling teenager.  There is nothing funny about the most irritating man created, prancing around in drag and ruining potentially tolerable sequences.  There's nothing funny about the slapstick shenanigans of bumbling police officers getting outfoxed in the most ludicrous of circumstances. There's nothing funny about The Fifth Element.In conclusion then, The Fifth Element is a confused muddle of genres, unwillingly stapled together in the most aberrant manner, and well, it's just rubbish.  Whilst I appreciate the film is intended to convey a somewhat comic-book style, it's still contrived trash that no intelligent audience should be subjected to.

The fact that the 3-D car chase scene is accompanied by \"Alech Taadi\" by rai star Khaled -- I tripped out when I recognized the song! I just can't imagine that scene succeeding with any other music now.3. The huge, unexplained pile of garbage in the spaceport. This IS what the future will be like if we're not careful.4. That bizarre, buggy dance that the hopped-up mugger kid does after Korben Dallas takes his gun away for him for the umpteenth time. It's about five seconds of the movie that could have been cut perfectly easily, and other people probably think it would have been an improvement to do so, but for me it just adds to the glorious lunacy.5.

One one level the film has more in common with Noir than sci-fi. Yes, it may be set in the far future but it has Noir sensibilities. The grizzled, chain-smoking Korbbin Dallas is the archetypal Noir protagonist. He gets roped into the whole \"save the world\" thing by other forces. He has no great ambitions at the onset of the film. On another level, the film is a parody of overly pompous sci-fi flicks like \"Star Wars.\" Besson is one of few directors to understand that sci-fi can and should have humor. Part of the cult status of \"Firefly\" was due to it's sense of humor and irony. On a third level, it is a romance. The real arc of the story is Korbbin finding \"the perfect girl.\" In the end, Korbbin can't save the world without the woman he loves. Despite all his knowledge of weapons and spacecraft, only love can vanquish evil. That's a beautiful sentiment I fear is lost on cynical American audiences and critics. The film was huge in Europe, which solidifies my theory that Europeans just have better taste. If you've watched this once, I'd recommend a second viewing. Repeated viewings of this film reveal a brilliant artistic visual style, a poignant anti-war statement, a sentimental love story and a biting satire. It's sad this film has been so maligned by critics and ignored by audiences.",

And they flew away, but promised to return. To save the planet. But only Bruce Willis, Chris Tucker and a couple of priests will be able to put the weapon of salvation into action. And the main element should be Mila Jovovich.Perhaps one of the strangest pictures and almost the last success of Besson as a director. It is regrettable, but perhaps it was here that his artistic taste changed. After Nikita and Leon, not to mention the Subway, something dramatic and stylish was expected, but it came out... Big style and Hollywood in the most condor version - pretentious, gigantic, pretentious...Everything is bad already at the level of the scenario - it seems that not everyone has even figured out the twists and turns: with whom does Zork communicate there, and why does he stand up so much for this Evil that threatens to bury the planet on which he has a business, and why are the stones going back and forth, and why did Lilu stay on Earth... In short, this is clearly not a Matrix for you, where its own mythology was born.So the universal ideas of Besson clearly failed. And there's not much for Mila Jovovich to do here.But... It seems to be nonsense, but it is beautiful, because it is saved by a group of technical specialists led by a director, cool music, screaming hi-tech and personally Bruce Willis, including an abyss of positive charm and Gary Oldman with a bunch of negative charm. So if you turn off the meanings and enjoy the pure action and attraction, then the spectacle will turn out to be professional and exciting. And you can also estimate that the main consumer of the Fifth Element was teenagers at one time, who could react quite correctly to the anti-war pathos. In the end, kindness and love win, and even with humor.",

            "content": "The Fifth Element is a great film that forces the audience to look at how we operate in the world to each other. Lee Loo (played by Milla Jovovich) is the fifth element, the supreme being who was designed as a weapon against the dark shadow. Every five thousand years there is a battle between Lee Loo and the dark shadow over mankind. The dark shadow wants to kill all humans, and Lee Loo saves them form his destruction. The guardians of the fifth element are being Lee Loo to earth to protect it for the dark shadow, when all of a sudden they are attacked, and the ship is destroyed. They believe they have killed Lee Loo and the Dark Shadow can prevail in killing the humans, but she survived through a single living limb. Scientist reconstructs her body, and she escapes the lab. Only to land in Korben Dallas (Bruce Willis) cab. Korben Dalls helps Lee Loo find her way to the priest (Ian Holm). Together, all three set out on an adventure to save the world.The central theme of \"The Fifth Element\" surrounds the truth of human nature. Lee Loo is referred to several times in the movie as being \"perfect\" As if the existing mankind that is alive today is unless than being perfect. That only a perfect specimen is worthy of saved all mankind. Lee Loo can also be looked at as a symbolic metaphor. When it is time for Lee Loo to active the weapon and obliterates the dark shadow, she mentions to Korben that she was only built to save the world. She is reluctant though because all mankind does is destroy each other. Korben reassures her that there are things worth saving like love, and tells Lee Loo he loves her. When the stones are opened by all the basic elements (Fire, water, earth, and wind), she unleashes a white light from her mouth to freeze the dark shadow. At this point Lee Loo becomes a visual metaphor as a beacon of light; that there is good in the world. Love conquers all and will defeat any evil.Many motifs play throughout the film for saving mankind, and the destruction of the human race. In one scene we see Lee Loo watching how mankind kills each other through a series of war clips see saw on the internet. She begins to become very emotional, and loses hope to save the world. This parallel coincidence was similar to clips in the movie Prometheus. We as humans are so quick to ask for help when we need it, but we also need help from ourselves with all of the self-destruction we inflict on each other. We can save the world by saving it from war on one another.",

When this film first came out, I was expecting something every bit as gripping and gritty as Leon, but with aliens and big spaceships and stuff.  Imagine my disappointment. Technically, and from what I suspect is the mainstream perspective, this film might be thought rather... I hesitate to use the word 'silly', but it seems the best one.And indeed, my first encounters with this film led me to hold all sorts of viciously negative views of it.  From the irritating proto-Binks Rubi Rhod, to the sleepwalking self-parody committed by Bruce Willis, to the hungry-looking lady in the unflattering band-aids and Ian Holm's dodgy comedy moments.  There is much to revile in this movie.And yet... if viewed at precisely the right angle, or through precisely the right mental haze... it's actually rather wonderful - as much because of its flaws as in spite of them.Chris Tucker IS annoying as Rubi Rhod.  Seen as a joke at the expense of The Artist Formerly Known As Prince however, he's hilarious.  Bruce Willis' performance does suggest that he's overcompensating for the ban on 'Bruce Willis-isms' Terry Gilliam imposed for his previous film, Twelve Monkeys. But then, he's playing a comic strip hero in a comic strip movie, and the character is certainly written as a parody of the action hero cliche, whether Willis knew to play him like that or not.Milla Jovovich looks at times like she's entirely composed of straight lines, and does not therefore conform to my notion of physical perfection... but that's quickly forgotten because her ideosyncratic, charming performance is both interesting to watch and faintly bewitching (There can't be many actors who knowingly speak gibberish so beautifully).It's true, as a science fiction adventure it's reminiscent of many other similar, sometimes better, films.  The action scenes are merely run-of-the-mill; the action-heroine is underused in certain respects (I wish she didn't do quite so much wilting, and think she should have rescued Bruce Willis from danger just once rather than continually needing to be rescued herself); the comedy is often rather flat and obvious; the story progresses in a piecemeal and often illogical way.  What distinguishes this film, however, is its imagination.  You really won't see many films quite like this.  Even the familiar 'future city' panorama feels quite original, when it could have just resorted to directly aping Bladerunner's imagery (as the lazier Attack of the Clones does).  If you've seen Leon or Nikita and want more of the same this film will disappoint; The Fifth Element is a far lighter exercise, with a more comedic mood to it - and while it won't slap you round the face and make you think it's the best film ever made, it may well charm a place into your affections, because (like its title character) at the end of the day it just wants to be loved.",

Love him or hate him this was a master stroke and picked the film up when it could have slowed in the middle. Altogether a masterpiece which I gave 10.",

The movie keeps you guessing, even though the general feeling is understandably, that we will survive, how to get there is never clear. Even the colors seem special to this movie. I have no problem telling my friends it is worth seeing as a rental or the occasional showings on HBO.",

The film its self has some great special effects and the story line gets you're interested.  However the sad thing is Luc Besson insists on making the 5th element an action comedy which just does not work.  Chris Tucker who plays the DJ just spoils the film for me and the whole result is a waste of time.  If only Luc Besson based the project on a seriously format it could have been a classic but chose to do the old style of trying to make this film more of a action comedy  which just does not work.",

Granted their aren't a hell of a lot of sci-fi comedies around but if more are made they could use this as a measuring stick. So what the plot is standard and thin, with so much going on there's little time to fit plot developing dialog in. Even the diva who most people seem to hate was nicely interwoven with leeloo's fight sequence. There's a lot of well paced cutting in this movie. Leeloo's stone story mixed with Gary Oldman's first attempt at acquiring them (including the hilarious weapon demo) comes to mind. As for the sets and art they're great. All the little details like the 2/3 filter cigs to the fold away furniture shows an attention to detail with an eye towards comedy.  I've always wondered if the director intended to make this gem so funny I can't believe it could be accidentally this funny. Even the costumes are funny. Only the warped mind of a runway designer could have come up with the hat the guy (I forget his name) wears when he tries to rob Bruce Willis. He looks like a futuristic crack head only he's burnt so many brain cells he can't operate futuristic weapons.  Chris Tucker too over the top? Naah. Reminds me of another well cut sequence, the spaceship lift off. Well that's only my opinion. Most probably disagree and think I'm a meat Popsicle but hey SMOKE YOU!

If all it required of the perfect 5th element is emit a bright white light? why a living being? and why so many DNA strands or whatever? All she ever did was smash a couple of walls kick half a dozen pig headed aliens and the biggest secret she carries is that she has a very powerful flashlight in her mouth. Two hours of life wasted",

Luc Besson's visual feast was just as vibrant and exciting as the first time I had seen it. I know some complain that the plot is weak, and it may move like a music video at times, but there is not a dull moment in the entire film! Even the some classic elements of the alien relationship building: the first exchange of names, learning English on TV, and a good remake of the Captain Kirk \"On Earth, we have a thing called love...\" flow smoothly and entertainingly between Willis and Jojovich.And of course Oldman just eats up scenes so well that you could almost root for him.Jojovich does a great job with the quivering angry face when she faces off against opponents and the quavering horrified face when she learns about w-a-r. But even if she couldn't act as well as she does, there is no other Leeloo Minai Lekatariba Laminatcha Ekbat De Sabat in the world.Last note I can tell you how cool this film is for deployment by relating what the troop in front of me said as we boarded the military transport to Iraq.

            "content": "Possibly the best sci-fi movie of the 90s. Visually impressive and original set in colorful, futuristic universe taken from French comic books. The universe is a mixture of that found in the Christin/M\u00e9zi\u00e8res comic book series Val\u00e9rian and in some of Moebius's works with some hints from Japanese comic books as well (Both M\u00e9zi\u00e8res and Moebius (Jean Giraud) were involved in the design). Imaginative costume design by Jean-Paul Gaultier gives the movie a very distinct an innovative style.I can easily understand why so many people don't like the film because it is so heavily focused on style and impressive sets, and few Americans have had the opportunity to get acquainted with the French-language comic book tradition which ads a special flavor to the movie. It is a mystery to me why so few of the high quality French and Belgian comic books have been published in America (most of these comic books have even been published in my native language Danish).My problem with the movie was a bit the same I had with the Jar Jar Binks character int the Phantom Menace. I really don't like ill-placed humour in sci-fi movies. Some of the \"funny\" scenes with the bad guy (Gary Oldman) are misplaced, and the president is seriously miscast. Maybe it is wrong to blame Besson since the inappropriate use of childish humour is not only a problem in this movie, but also in the unfortunate development of the Val\u00e9rian comics it has been influenced by. Moebius has a strong sense of humour, but in a very strange and surreal way that the movie doesn't even try to copy.Because of these flaws The Fifth Element cannot reach Blade Runner which I would consider the best sci-fi ever made. Interestingly enough, some of the earlier, darker, and more ideological oriented sci-fi comics by Christin/M\u00e9zi\u00e8res have some of the same qualities as Ridley Scott's masterpiece. If there is a sci-fi director out there in need of a good idea, check out some of the Val\u00e9rian comics from the 70s.",

Jovovich shows that she has an acting talent(not just a pretty face), when she shows vulnerability as well as toughness in a convincing way. Bruce Willis shows himself as his more or less usual character, but in this movie it works. And the story is indeed remarkably good. It has the spices of a little \"fantasy-history\", a superhero which for once is a woman and the always money making end of the earth. But it is rarely well sewn together. As one might fear in an event like this, the authorities tries to take the show to the extent that it nearly causes disaster. very well acting on all parts, and a story for all lovers of fantasy or sci-fi.

The movie does not depend on it's graphics, or special effects, but rather support a wonderful cast and exude the director's desired world.To be honest, I first saw the film for Bruce Willis, and I was pleasantly surprised by Mila's performance.  Who knew that a model could act so well? And of course, we can't forget Chris Tucker...amazing.  I felt that each actor/actress completely embraced a science-fiction frame of mind and made the film work.Finally, we have a true, timely science-fiction movie that can, and most likely will still be believable in a few years time.  Compare it to Space Oddessy 2001 (though it was much more an epic), and you'll quickly notice that the technology used in that movie, like many others (such as star trek), is laughable.Hollywood has always been enamoured with science-fiction, and in The Fifth Element, they've hit the nail on the head.Please enjoy!!!",

I had heard of the film and wanted to watch it at the cinema, but being 12, I was always poor, but fortunately, my friend had borrowed it from an uncle, and both being sci-fi geeks, decided to watch it.. I was absolutely blown away by the overall presentation of the film, and fell in love with it immediately. It focuses on the stereotypical sci-fi action thriller, where an evil from outer space is set to destroy the universe, and the hero(s) have to stop it. There is definitely a cult status around this film, and it still doesn't get boring for me. There are several of my favourite actors in this film, especially a very diverse villain played by Gary Oldman, an absolutely stunning heroine who in my view, started the revolution of the female hero, rather than the 'damsel in distress' that we have seen for many years, played by Milla Jovovich. and a really anti-hero like hero played by Bruce Willis. Luc Besson has directed several of my favourite films, and seeing an interview that he had during the release of the film, it seems that he had been working on the main storyline as a child. I'm glad to see that somebody could come up with one of their own ideas for a film in Hollywood, rather than releasing a very poor re-vamp of an old classic, as we have come to see nowadays. I love the effects that were used in the film, regardless of whether people say they are dated, and there is one of the best movie-score soundtracks to this film. In my opinion, an underrated classic. Watch this film!",

If you love science fiction, action, adventure, or just imagine what kind of cool stuff the future may hold for humankind - this is a must-see film.

From the moment the movie begins, you know that you are going to be in for something magical and wonderful. I grew up reading Heavy Metal Magazine and enjoyed the animated motion picture as well. This movie brought together all of the incredible art and magic of those artist into a live action film with great acting and a brilliant story. Thank you, Luc Besson (and the artists that helped you) - you have created a brilliant work of art!",

If you look through the comments, most people had a misconception as to what this was about.  The first time I saw it I was going to see it because of Willis because I expected a solid action movie.  It is that, but much more.  This movie has a very good tempo to it; there are hundreds of minor things that can be missed that are self-mocking or intentional puns on other popular sci-fi movies.  It ranges from serious to comedic, but only rarely goes too far off track (only instance I remember is the final scene before they land in Egypt w/ the nuke).  Don't assume the acting is over-the-top or that the movie will be what you expect.  Everything falls into place once you see the bigger picture.  This is definitely one of my all-time favorites, especially for a genre that is seriously lacking.   9.5/10",

Someone with a good enough vision will put out good work regardless of age.  Leeloo (Jovovich) comes close to stealing the show under Korben's (Willis) feet.  Her character was completely disarming, and her incoherent babbling actually seemed to make sense the way she said it.  Overall, I would give this an 8 of 10.  It is an amazing movie if you take it as it is given.",

I'm an art student, so I really appreciated the over-the-top audio-visual smorgasboard that Besson does best. A lot of love went into this film. His vision of the future closely resembles mine---lots of chaos, but somehow things get done anyway. And that future is portrayed exactly as if we had just been suddenly thrown into it (like jovovich's character): dizzyingly colorful and chaotic, but filled with wonder and awe too. One couldn't ask for a better cast, especially Ian Holm and Gary Oldman. Eric Serra's ethereal score is the ideal match for the mood of the film.A couple of negatives, like police brutality and corporate megalomania, the shootup scenes went a little long, and the ending was kinda corny, but nothing that ruins the film as a whole. Besson's 5th El. has its own unique, sometimes ludicrous energy, which sets its apart from any other films. I thought this was a truly enjoyable movie.",

            "content": "This movie is a mix of a spoof and and homage, to both sci-fi and pop culture. I found it hilarious with great eye candy, a real treat to watch. Think of it as a 90s kaleidescope of various traditions, cliches, and conventions, in a silly framework of America's favorite medium, science fiction. In essence, it's an intentional b-movie of the 90s.\nFirst of all, 90% of this movie is a reference/spoof/homage to *something*, either in pop culture or science fiction. Many of the devices are drawn from not only B sci-fi of it's decade, but also heavily from 50s-70s sci-fi short stories, of which I happen to be a huge fan. For example, the little robots cleaning up the mess is almost perfectly as described by Ray Bradbury, and even Zorg's speech (slightly modified) in that scene is drawn from a mid-60s Hugo winner, by an author whose name escapes me.The culture references are equally engaging. I love the Thai ship, McDonalds, Ruby Rod, etc. Several of them are double references, also. Some day I'm going to sit down and make a complete list of every reference in the script and film... then again, I'll prolly never have that much time on my hands.There is alot of quite intentional campiness. Think about this for a moment: if they could do the visuals for so many of the great-looking scenes, why do the Mangalores looked so stupid? I think it's hilarious how sleek everything is, but the Mangalores look like something out of an old Star Trek episode. Zorg embodies the 90s cliched badguy perfectly (I mean come on, he's named Zorg), yet Oldman still manages to creep me out with his psychopathically blank eyes.This movie isn't about humans being made to love, or war being evil, it's about the silliness of American culture. The whole love theme and the second-thought morality are things mandated in B-movies; You couldn't possible do a 90s m\u00e9lange without it.Comparing this to Star Wars is ridiculous, but I hazard another comparison: I think this movie has done for sci-fi what the Austin Powers movies did for spy movies. It makes us laugh at ourselves, and yet at the same time feel for the characters. I love this movie for the memories, the laughs, the music, and the rhythm, and I think as time passes it will be even more fun to look back on as the decade I grew up in.",

The 5th Element doesn't exactly possess the quality to produce tears, but the story line and characters are just simply fun to watch.  Eric Serra, the composer for the film who usually works with Luc Besson, did an incredible job with this soundtrack too.  I mean not the kinda stuff you would pump up in your car, but listen to it in the movie and in it's context, it really is amazing.  Eric Serra has a great gift and so does Luc, so put em together, and you have got a good movie at least.

However, it is no more science fiction than Monty Python's \"The Holy Grail.\" It is, at its heart, a comedy -- and a very good one.There are many key elements to a good comedy, but timing is the most important factor. Luc Besson proved himself a master of comedy timing. Not only does he have the actors (and props) cued to perfection, his film editing is done in a style later to become highly popular on the television comedies \"Coupling\" and \"How I Met Your Mother.\" As one group of characters ends a scene, a quick cut to different characters continues the conversation with comedic effect. The real result is a non-stop volley of jokes, sight gags, and quick-cut timing that gives the viewer more of an experience than just a long wait for the big finish.It should be noted that Luc made a risky choice of employing very few comedic actors in his movie. Bruce Willis was known for comedy long before he became an action star. However, Gary Oldman was more popular for dark brooding characters and Milla Jovovich was mainly known for being cute in skimpy clothing. As for Chris Tucker, this was his breakout role that cemented his character as \"the mouth\" - which he has continued alongside Jackie Chan.",

Chris Tucker's Ruby Rod , though at first annoying, winds up helping Bruce and Mila, and along the way becomes a bit of a hero himself.

This movie made me believe that, and his ability was revealed again in \"The 6th Sense\". Well done Willis. For me this movie shows a future that come very well be possible, much like the of Ridley Scott in \"Blade Runner\", such as the cigarettes with huge filters, the sky-scraper McDonald's and a new religion. Gary Oldman seemed at home in his usually bad guy role, Milla Jokovich seemed, pardon the pun, perfect for Leelu and Willis was spot on as an ex-army boy as Kroben Dallas.

That may have been my favorite thing of the movie, the glorious screen shoots we were able to see.Luc Besson directed this film, being one of many he's directed over the years. Luc Besson first became widely known after his fourth film became an instant hit; La Femme Nikita. This film was nominated for over 10 awards, and won over 5. Like Nikita, Luc Besson allowed his imagination to take flight when he took on becoming the director for this film. Helping his imagination came to life Besson had the help of Mark A. Mangini, who was nominated for an Oscar for best special effects. Mangini used the latest technology of the time to give the viewer what it would be like in a futuristic world. As Leeloo, the fifth element looks out unto New York we see just how good Mangini is at his job. We see trains that work like elevators driving vertically up buildings; we get a glimpse of what traffic is like in a world where there are no more lanes but instead flying cars driving at different levels and in different directions. Or when Corbin takes the police for a car chase throughout the city of New York ins and outs of the city's futuristic train system underground.Then you have the main characters that were great in their roles. We have Corbin Dallas played by the ever manly Bruce Willis, or the fifth element Leeloo, who challenged the idea of a man being the saver of the day. Then we have Gary Oldman, who had worked with Luc Besson a few years earlier in Leon, once again played the villain, with all the fun toys that comes with the role of the evil villain.Unlike most films where the hero is the man, once again Besson puts the women in the place of the hero who saves the day. Leeloo, a beautiful delicate woman was the true saver of the day. Yes, there was macho Corbin (Willis) who swoops in to save Leeloo from the police, but in reality it was really Leeloo that was the real hero of the Fifth Element. We also have the idea of not only world peace but peace between planets and galaxies. Is peace only 500 years away? This film gives us the idea that though not everyone will get along the majority of the galaxies will be able to come together and offer a time when not only do countries get along the universe does. As we see when the first troubles of the movie start and the President of the universe with power over the galaxy.The Fifth Element is a great movie to lose one self in with what the future may look like. The plot may have been done before but the technology of this movie was the best of its times. If you enjoy science fantasy with a bit of action the Fifth Element is a movie you will enjoy.",

After all,the vision effect is very very wonderful,and so is the BGM.I like the ending song-A Little Light of Love.Ending?No question to ask!The hero and the girl will surely save the world,mission completed,everyone is cheering!But where are our heroes?...Milla was orange-hair,spoke so-called divine language,wore less,though Korben in film describes her as '5'9\",blue eyes,long legs,great skin',I just want to say,Milla,wear more,you have a perfect figure,but is it necessary to show it entirely to us?",

            "content": "Luc Besson's Fifth Element is definitely a feast for the eyes and ears. Whether it has to do with the wonderfully 'sloppy' sci-fi (not so shiningly perfect as US productions like Star Trek), the tongue-in-cheek humor (Gary Oldman and Chris Tucker at their best), Jean-Paul Gaultier's hilarious costumes (the policemen...) or the relaxed acting - every time one sees the movie new aspects come alive.The basic storyline - good vs. evil where a pretty couple try to save all - is treated as a given by Besson & Co., while the setting, music and imagery get all the attention they deserve. The spine-chilling opera/dance sequence in the middle of the film is just 'one of those' surprises in the movie.Bruce Willis adds another excellent title to his palmares - together with \"Pulp Fiction\" and \"Twelve Monkeys\" - and makes good for his horrible action flicks. And of course watch out for Milla Jovovich as Leeloo, who has a memorable pronounciation of the word \"multipass'...Besides all of this, there is a quote which should be in the top-10 of movie history's all-time favorites (like \"I'll be back\" or \"Here's looking at you, kid\"):\"Are you German?\"",

He's the reluctant hero, the one who saves the world in his vest even though he's retired, and doesn't want to get involved. Milla Jovovitch is actually very attractive for a change, Ian Holm is great (well he's ALWAYS great) and Gary Oldman - great part for him, but REALLY bad accent!and...The sheer look and feel of the film is superb. The costumes are spot on, the aliens are great, the effects cool (I loved the \"cruise ship\".So much so that I just went with the flow, ignoring the holes in the plot and the series of very wooden incidental  cameos from has-been musicians and loving the STYLE of it. Very compelling, like Bladerunner, very silly, like Galaxy Quest, and very stylish, like Lynch's Dune.Highlights: \"Anyone else wanna negotiate?\" \"I'm very disappointed\" \"Multipass\" the bit with the \"red button\" and \"I'm Korben, and you are...?\" \"Leeloo Minai Lekarariba-Laminai-Tchai Ekbat De Sebat\"",

It seems he got bored around the same point while working on these three movies and handed the reins to somebody else. Putting Chris Tucker's character in the movie is like having the ring-tone The Annoying Thing (AKA Crazy Frog) play on the soundtrack of Schindler's List or Titanic when the ship ...Anyway, Luc Besson has improved his directorial skills markedly, The Messenger:The Story of Joan of Arc was amazing - and it's the one film which show's Milla Jovovich can really act when she wants to. In Fifth Element she does what the role demands of her, but when you see the exact character reprised in two seriously inferior movies (The Resident Evil ones) then it demeans her performance in this movie. Especially if, like me, you see those movies before this one.I gave the movie a 7/10 which is high, and had it not introduced the very, very, very annoying Chris Tucker character, it would certainly have been on my Top 10 list of Si-Fi movies ... but unfortunately it did, and it will continue to do so every time I watch the movie - so I'll never watch it again. For comparison, think of the screechy character which spoilt the later additions of the Police Academy series of movies.",

I didnt see this first time around and am watching it for the first time in 2018.. I generally believe they are making scifi films better in recent years than they have in the past.. Not always - but usually! The visuals and effects here are very nice... But the plot is thin. Nothing much here is gripping. A lot of the more recent edgy sci-fi's just bury this thing..

This movie was both. While the plot wasn't the best, you have to keep in mind that any movie isn 't going to have a plot worthy of a good Sci Fi novel, simply because 2-3 hours isn't enough time to put a whole novel into.

Chris Tucker knocked two of them off unfortunately. He was not funny at all. Bruce Willis exhibited his great acting skills as he always does and Luc Besson is one of my favorite and he never ceases to amaze me.

We could only hope that all comedies could be done on this grand of a scale, with so much visual flair and invention.  \"The Fifth Element\" succeeds because it never takes itself seriously, because it knowingly borrows from nearly every science fiction movie ever made.  Is there any doubt that the designers at Lucasfilm were blown away by this film?  Most of the artistic schemes at work in \"The Phantom Menace\" resemble those seen in this Luc Besson creation.The story is pure cheese, but the frame built around it is nothing but ingenious.  All of the acting is wonderful in this film, from Bruce Willis playing a very amusing variation on his one character (the character of Bruce Willis) to Milla Jovovich's seamless use of an invented language. Naturally, Gary Oldman delivers as the bad guy, and Ian Holm shows a gift for comedy that I never expected to see.The truest delights of the film are the clever transitions from one scene to the next; Oldman asks a question in one scene, and he is answered by Jovovich's laugh as Besson cuts to another scene.  There are nifty moves like this throughout the film.\"The Fifth Element\" is often viewed as goofy, guilty pleasure; I see it as one of the best science fiction films ever made.

So far so good - that's a reasonably strong starting point for a plot. Then we discover this new (fifth) element is a gorgeous babe and we no longer care about the merits of the script. Milla Jovavich does a great acting job as a confused and english-challenged alie... er... element. Her performances have been criticised and I think some critics have brought along their previous opinions as baggage. Here she was great and not just because she exudes cute innocence and sex appeal (which she did with style). The Loriel girl definitely proved she's worth it.Bruce Willis does the diehard thing again. Aliens get shot, Leloo discovers humanity isn't all roses, things blow up, heroes fallin love.

A great story with a deep, thoughtful plot, the movie tells a greater story of love conquering evil. But it's not a serious movie by any means. There is lots of action, lots of comedy, and a surprising amount of unique art and music for a sci-fi action movie. The cinematography and music was beautiful at times, and other times just silly or even painfully-bad, but it all went very well with the overall theme of the movie. Very entertaining, for anyone, even if you're not into sci-fi or action movies. I definitely recommend seeing this one, it's a very unique movie to say the least.",

Overall this movie sets out to be what it's meant to be. Yet it starts off too slow for me to rank the movie as a whole highly. Eric Serra's soundtrack as usual is pretty well suited to the movie. I never took this movie seriously to begin with. It's like a comedy basically. It's pretty funny once it picks up. I feel if I'm going to re-watch this film though that... I'll have to fast forward 20 minutes in.If you want to see Luc Besson's best work in my opinion, I suggest you check out the movie Leon.",

            "content": "Hi, my names Jason, and I'm 18 years old. I've browsed this site for useful information for a long time now, but due to certain events I finally decided to join the site.You see, for a few years now, I had heard people talking about The Fifth Element, saying that it was pretty good. So a few months ago, I saw about the first 10 minutes of it on TV, and it really caught my attention. After that, I really wanted to see the whole movie, but kept getting distracted...So last week (last Wednsday to be exact. Thursday was my 18th birthday:)) on a spur of the moment sort of thing, I decided to swing by my local movie store and rent this movie.I watched it that night, and I was shocked. Shocked and blown away at how incredible it is. I don't quite know what it is. I realize that its just an ordinary sci-fi flick from '97, but for some reason, I cant get enough. I had it for 5 nights, and I watched it once on each of those 5 nights. By the second night, I had already searched eBay for a copy on DVD, and purchased it for $16USD. I had to return the movie last night, and now I cant wait to receive my copy in the mail so I can watch it again. I can easily see myself watching this movie at least once a week for the rest of my life :D It is my new favorite movie, and I don't see that ever changing.The characters were all so memorable. Bruce Willis was already one of my favorite actors (gotta love Die-hard, and Pulp Fiction) but his portrayal of New York cabbie Korben Dallas was incredible. Hes the only actor I know who can be so light hearted and witty, yet such a badass at the same time, ya know? Negative, I'm a meat popcicle :D, gotta love him.I'm also a huge fan of the Resident Evil game series, and after seeing Resident Evil the movie, I really disliked Milla Jovovich. But seeing this movie made me realize how wrong I was. Just because Paul W. Anderson created a crap character isn't her fault. Shes an actress, it isn't her place to understand RE. But as beautiful Leeloo, she was amazing. I cant believe how flawless she seemed speaking that divine language.Chris Tucker? Ha, who doesn't love him. As Smokey in Friday, and of course his character in Rush Hour, hes hilarious, but nothing he ever does could possibly match up to the lovable flamboyant radio star, Ruby Rhod. He has a hilariously addicting voice. I laughed at pretty much everything he said.And of course Gary Oldman, as villain Jean-Baptiste Emanuel Zorg. I've never hated a guy, yet found him so lovable at the same time. I love his accent! The guy is just the perfect villain.But it goes beyond the characters. Its a visual masterpiece. Its nearly 10 years old, and even now the effects amaze me.But it goes even deeper than that. A epic love story. Sure that part didn't fill much screen time, but it was definitely there.This movie has absolutely everything that a great film could possibly have. Its the perfect combination of comedy, drama, and action. I'm very passionate about things like this. I'm also a huge fan of Hideo Kojima's Metal Gear video game series, and until I saw The Fifth Element, no work of fiction came close to touching the wave of emotion I feel when I play those games.As i said earlier, I'm 18. And I've had many problems. I don't have much money, I have many medical problems, because of which I'm a high school drop-out, and I quite frankly had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. But seeing this film made me realize that I myself want to make movies! My only regret is that I came in so late :( This film is nearly 10 years old, and I'm just now experiencing it. Why couldn't I have seen it in '97? Now I feel so alone. I just want to be able to discuss the film with others who have the same passion.",

Endevoured with unusual creatures and characters such as Zorg, his minions and plavalaguna ,they don't follow traditional appearances of aliens and personalities making it different. This film was considered to have the highest budget of its time in 1997, with 80 million spent, and more than 250 million earned. I'm not a particular fan of Sci-Fi movies, but this is one of a kind and my favourite and will remain so to me.

Together with the Gaultier costume design there's a perfect 'real-world only slightly grittier' Jetsons vibe to it all. So many ideas, nice premise and potential greatness is served by a mess of story. It veers between serious sci-fi and bawdy french comedy in an instant, only in a way which isn't satisfying. The stars aren't sure what film they're in either... Bruce Willis is Bruce Willis, Ian Holm is in a late 70's sci-fi, Gary Oldman is a Saturday morning cartoon hammy villain chewing the scenery. As just a few examples. For me, it doesn't hold together, it's just annoyingly schizophrenic, although I can see why it's become a cult favourite.",

I was particularly impressed with the costumes.  Very futuristic, and appropriate considering the overall look of the film.  The music is top-notch.

Because if it does, maybe I am.\"There's a quote from a vastly superior, albeit more modern Sci-Fi action film that funnily enough encapsulates everything I feel when digesting what I just watched, coupled with some of the the feedback I've been seeing from others.NOTE! If you like this film and find it hilarious, that's totally fine. Humour is completely subjective. For the people that will inevitably be saying to themselves \"you're just taking it too seriously\" - I understand this film is just meant to be one of those \"turn your brain off and have fun and laugh\" types of movies. Sorry but that doesn't absolve it from criticism, especially when it didn't get one laugh out of me (which is impressive). I laugh hard at films like The Room, but that also doesn't mean that film isn't terrible. I want to share my honest perspective and first time viewing experience with this review. I also want to be clear that I went into this film blind and with no preconceived notions. All I knew is that this was an \"Action Sci-Fi movie\". I've got to go and thank Wiki for omitting the actual genre later, which is \"Comedy\".Let's try to unravel some of this film then, with a brief overview of what is by *far* the most interesting part. The first five minutes. If nothing else, anyone questioning this review can understand that I really was trying my best to pay attention to this mess. This is also the only truly good part, aside from the visual/set design, which is at least fun to look at:The plot revolves around the title namesake, the \"Fifth Element\". So back in the early 1900's, some archaeologists are researching a small Egyptian construct and some hieroglyphics that foretell a chain of events far into the future about the potential destruction, but ultimate saviour of the universe. When Fire,Water, Earth, Wind meet with the Fifth Element, a Deus Ex Machina will occur to save all of us.We meet a man who is known to the Archaeologists, and clearly unhappy with the fact that these pair seem to be unearthing too much information here about future events. Shortly after a failed murder attempt by this guy by spiking their drinks, we meet some alien visitors, known to the drink spiker, who open another chamber to a room where the elements may be activated to in turn, activate the ultimate defence weapon. Due to the uncertainty of the fate of this location on Earth, they end up leaving with the key components needed to activate said weapon (alongside the \"Fifth Element\"), until such a time in the future when they will be needed. 300 Years in the future to be precise. But before they leave, they end up providing the \"drink spiker\" with a key to the secret room that holds the five elemental pedestals, which will allow humanity to activate the weapon when the time comes.So the intro is framed as being pretty serious. Not knowing at the time that this is in fact a bad comedy film, I was intrigued enough to keep watching...Without recounting each event of the film, the de-evolution of content here is mind numbingly bad. So bad that I'm still trying to understand what I just watched.What I just don't understand is the public perception and bizarre adoration for this film. Chris Tucker's character is the most obnoxious, most painful character I've ever seen and listened to in a film, period. No really, I cannot think of anyone I'd rather listen to less. Yet, worth noting that at almost the same time of release funnily enough, Jar Jar Binks' actor from Star Wars TPM is the one that gets viciously pelted with mass hatred? Extreme hate in fact. Go watch Ahmed Best's YouTube interviews about that.Story wise and one thing to its benefit is that I suppose this film (shockingly) gets away without too many plotholes. The plot itself is pretty basic, and goes about the way you'd expect with the heroes saving the day, but let me touch on some of the things that had my eyes rolling:1 - Why does Korben agree to help Leeloo, other than because he's just a horny guy? I get the sentiment dude but you don't know this person and have no legit reason to want to help her and break the law at the same time....2 - Why doesn't Zorg make any sense, or pose any threat at all? More specifically, why doesn't he lock his ship when he leaves it so as to prevent an easy hijacking, and why doesn't he actually check the contents of packages he's captured before leaving and celebrating? Why is he in service of this bizarre evil entity in the first place, does he think it will spare him and allow him to continue his business as usual to \"create jobs and opportunity\" as he puts it? I don't get this character from his motivations all the way down to his design. If he was solely meant to be funny, I must have missed that.3 - Why does Korben insist on using Chris Tucker's character for assistance in a combat situation, or *any* situation for that matter? No really, can someone explain Chris Tucker's character and why he was allowed to tag along right up to the ending of the film? Maybe it's that marmite type of humour, and I know which side I'm on to the extreme degree.4 - Why is Korben in love with Leeloo, despite them barely interacting, and only in broken English throughout the film? SOMEONE HELP IT MAKE SENSE. I'm not one for social justice and wokery at all, but thank god we managed to get past nonsensical and clich\u00e9 action star \"love interests\" like this. In fairness, they weren't all bad at all, but what even was that at the end? Make it make sense please.I want to wash my hands with this mess now so that'll be all from me on this movie. The rest that precedes and follows is unfunny, crude, random jokes and a completely predictable story. The film isn't compelling, it definitely isn't funny, and it's absolutely not intriguing.If you would like to watch a crazy comedy Sci-Fi movie, with an insanely clich\u00e9 plot, non-existent character development, mediocre writing, and the most irritating character ever put on screen, you've got a winner. I hope you can at least enjoy it more than I did!",

Chris Tucker is funny as he!! in this movie, Bruce Willis is very sexy and also got to show his comedic side. The girl who played Lilo played her with such innocence that it was very easy to root for her. My all time favorite scenes in The Fifth Element were when Lilo beat all of those weirdos up as the Diva was singing. The part when she's dancing and saying \"huh huh....\" is so much fun to watch. I've memorized most of this movie and I always adore at the end when they do the elements and Lilo is the 5th Element. Zeus as the president was a genius decision. He was very convincing and so funny especially at the end when he was arguing with his mother. I would recommend The Fifth Element to anyone who likes futuristic stuff, comedy, drama, action and romance. The villain in the movie is also a scene stealer, he's just hilarious.",

On the page, and even with the principal cast \"star\" list, \"The Fifth Element\" is one of those summer blockbusters designed to make the studios a big buck and then vanish.  But like \"Seven\", when in the hands of a master director something else happens.  They apply style, and suddenly you have something stunning.Every facet of this film fits with every other facet.  You take take a single frame from the film and you just \"know\" it's \"The Fifth Element\".That's style.  And style matters more than character OR plot.  What do compelling characters or intricate plots matter if you can unify them in the style of the story-telling?When \"The Matrix\" came out die hard anime fans rejoiced that this film had managed to bring the comic book into real life.  But they seem to have forgotten \"The Fifth Element\".  Because \"The Fifth Element\" is exactly that, with it's plots, characters, production design, and framing, it's editing, everything about it screams comic book.  Once again it all comes back to style.It's just a pity that when audiences see a film that has one of those \"blockbuster\" actors in it they automatically and instantly class the film as a mere \"blockbuster\" bit of mindless entertainment and are then unable to ever see the film for its real worth.",

Plot is reasonably simple and our hero's move through a barrage of set pieces in order to get to conclusion of the movie.It has a great cast, Willis - Oldman - Jovovich and a lovely little stint from Lee Evans. They all worked well together and they seemed like they were having a lot of fun working on this movie. They all dress in amazing costumes that I hope to hell that we, as a species, never actually start dressing like. Visually stunning you may feel like you have to watch the movie again just to appreciate if fully.Oldman Pulls off the whole bad guy routine so well, his character is also silly but you can believe that he is as mean as he makes out to be. Chris Tucker plays probably the most annoying person ever to grace the big screen. If he is like that in real life he should be shot. But that was his part and he played it well. His Haircuts alone make the movie worth watching.Anyway, if you like movies with explosions, hot actors, comedy and a plot line that doesn't requires a masters degree to understand. This is for you. So switch off your brain, engage you popcorn arm and sit back and enjoy this for what it is. A silly space romp!",

            "content": "After looking for the name of an obscure character in The Fifth Element, I came across a lot of negative user comment about this film and opted to add my own \"two cents\". First of all, many comparisons have been made to Besson's earlier work (esp. La Femme Nikita and Leon [aka \"The Professional]) which is unfair. Previous Besson movies have been concerned primarily with the analysis of one or two character's motives. The Fifth Element attempts to address the shortcomings and flaws of mankind as a whole. The fact that this is wrapped up in some fairly bog-standard sci-fi-come-love-story packaging is largely irrelevant and not necessarily to the detriment of the film as a whole.Besson's movies are essentially about character and how their relationship with other characters affect them throughout the story. A little like John Hughes' work I guess. This is the case with The Fifth Element. The two central characters played by Willis and Jovowich are at opposite ends of the emotional spectrum. By the end of the film both characters have met somewhere in the middle: Leeloo (Jovowich) has come to learn \"humanness\" whilst Korben Dallas (Willis) has found beauty, purity and perfection in an otherwise drab existence. Visually, The Fifth Element is stunning, mixing Metropolis/Bladerunner-esque environments with European chic to create something that is loud, noisy but genuinely beautiful. Jean Paul Gautier's outlandish costume design, whilst bizarre at times (like Ruby Rhod's leopardskin jump-suits!) gives a very unique modern-ness not usually seen in tales of the future. As mentioned earlier, The Fifth Element is just a very simple save the universe love story but done with such style and humour that the movie is a great watch from start to finish. Milla Jovowich is gorgeous as the flame-haired Leeloo and takes a lot of the movie's greatest moments: her pouting expression and wide-eyed innocence is superbly acted. Willis is, as usual, adequate, as the action hero (his best film is still Sixth Sense) and Ian Holm as the bumbling priest lights up every scene he's in. Gary Oldman is okay as the obligatory baddie but I think completely underused after his excellent performance in Leon.Overall, The Fifth Element is a great little film. Fun to watch, pretty to look at and every frame is a work of art (the one thing I love about Besson's film-making). Sure, not his best film to date but certainly not one which deserves the surprising amount of criticism.4/5",

            "content": "A tremendous movie that could have risen to the heights of vision of Blade Runner, The Fifth Element is held back by Bruce Willis' inability to allow himself to feel any emotion other than cynicism and triumph.  Great effects and spot-on casting bring the future into a cogent and new view as cabby Korben Dallas (Willis) is thrust into holding Earth's future in his back seat when the curvaceous and naive galactic wanderer LeeLoo (Milla Janovich) falls through the roof of his cab.  Dodging cops, fighting bad guy Zorg (Gary Oldman, delighting in chewing every piece of scenery in sight) and racing time itself to beat an ancient dictum that mandates mankind's end, Bruce/Korben must deliver LeeLoo, some ancient stone tablets retrieved from a intergalactic opera star's innards, and the unknown Fifth Element to a ritualistic location so mankind's contract with the universe can be renewed.\nWARNING, MINOR SPOILER AHEAD.Earth, Wind, Fire and Water comprise the first Four Elements, but the Fifth escapes everyone's recognition until long after the movie is over - oh yeah, LOVE, Bruce was supposed to be falling in LOVE with Milla Janovich's LeeLoo. Sorry, missed that.  Too busy watching Bruce dispatch the bad guys and win against all odds (he could do this, but he should give some clue that the outcome is in doubt, like in Die Hard).Chris Tucker rocks as cyber host Ruby Rhod, and Ian Holm brings true acting chops to the supporting role of Cornelius, the priest who knows the ins and outs of this whole mankind-is-going-to-end deal.  Gary Oldman scales new heights of camp as the metal-skulled Zorg, and Milla Janovich looks great in orange hair and strips of cloth.  (She is actually surprisingly moving in a part voiced mostly in gibberish.)   Great supporting work by Brion James of the aforementioned Blade Runner, and Tiny Tim Lister is awesome as President Lindberg. Unfortunately, the entire effort is tripped up by star power, and I don't mean the kind that twinkle in the sky.  The really sad thing is that Bruce Willis probably CAN act this part; I guess he just doesn't want to anymore.",

The overtones of Adolf Hitler portrayed with Gary Oldman has a slightly ridiculous feel about it and I don't think are completely necessary.

The action is fast and furious with loads of special effects that also have cartoon overtones, Judge Dredd the movie could have been like this.. if only.

Bruce Willis gets some of his usual action scenes, but the role has a lot more depth than your run-of the mill action movie hero. They both deliver some superb acting. Throw Ruby Rhod into the mix and you get a totally colorful, strange depiction of our future, but still the movie manages to get back into the \"Movies To Be Taken Seriously\" department towards the end. This movie has suspense, has laughs, has feasts for the eye, has dialogue, a story and superb acting by Willis, Jovovich, the ingenious Gary Oldman, Ian Holm, and of course, whats-his-name Rhuby Rhod. The soundtrack is also great, especially the singing performance by Inva Mulla Tchako (the Diva from the movie, the actress is not the one who sang though) which was probably aided digitally a little. Towards the end we have a hardcore-Kleenex scene...*sniff*...love saves the world despite all evil...but the ending scene is a lot less melancholic and philosophical. *grins* You'll see what I mean. The director is also to be commended, cause transitions from one scene to another are perfect. (Examples are to be found during the shuttle's liftoff or when the countdown arrives at \"10\"). Watch this movie. It's great. 10/10.",

Both want to achieve total domination, and they do so with immensely powerful means and an army of docile subordinates, but not without fumbling helplessly with technology. While Zorg's gets killed, Zorglub makes his exit on a lowly bicycle instead of one of his high-tech skycars, after grossly misspelling \"Coca-Cola\" on the moon.And about Korben Dallas and LeeLo, don't look towards Jean Giraud (M\u00f6bius) for inspiration. Korben is obviously inspired from Christin & M\u00e9zi\u00e8res' tech-savvy Val\u00e9rian, while Leelo is Laureline (a sorceress [witches aren't usually beautiful] who comes into the high-tech stories through magic, and who always saves Val\u00e9rian's ass when his high-technology gets overwhelmed).The Fifth Element is obviously a frenchman's satire of the americans, which are regarded as being kitsch and masters of bad-taste, yet not without a hint of admiration for New-York City, the average frenchman's idea of what America is. How better embody this better than with the \u00fcberkitsch Fhlostom Paradise luxury liner? And to drive the point home even more effectively, Ruby Rhod really rubs-in the epitome of kitschness.Likewise, Besson's view of futuristic New-York is an endless superposition of clich\u00e9s; the kamikaze cabbies, the towering buildings, the street violence, the cool policemen going about their business, and the zanyness of some eccentric characters not noticed by the rest of the people... But here, one will have no trouble crediting M\u00f6bius for the scenery, directly inspired from the well-cities of L'Incal.Finally, The Fifth Element is an immensely enjoyable movie, if only because of it's unconventionnal roots: the franco/belgian comic-book science-fiction school.",

One of the few movies I could watch start to finish.It was my first encounter with the thrilling Milla Jovovich. I tell you I think she's an amazing actress! Such range. I mean if you only know her from The Fifth Element and Resident Evil you wouldn't think so, but she was also in Zoolander as Katinka and in The Messenger as Joan. Sure she doesn't really have any boobs but she's got a lot of personality, she puts a lot of strength and vulnerability to her characters. A kick a** female! That diva song is so beautiful. Touching.I think that this is such a cool take on the future too. The technology is far more advanced, but the people seem real, kind of gritty. It's like the characters are each unique. I like how you can see normal people trying to make their living. The cops at the McDonalds, the Chinese guy, Corban's small apartment with all the modern conveniences and extreme lack of space hehe.Gosh I remember when Leeloo's fight scene was up for a nomination on the MTV awards. I was watching. I voted for it. I forget the others.Bruce Willis is good. I find that in my opinion his characters are often similar, but that is my perspective. I just think of Sin City, Armageddon, and Unbreakable here. He's someone who gets stuff done. Doesn't freak out. He's the guy you call when you're in trouble. Not much for conversation, a man of few words. Calm. Hehe I liked him in Pulp Fiction too. My favorite part is where he freaks out and starts cursing \"Bedside table, next to the kangaroo. i told her specifically not to forget my watch!\"Somebody get Chris Tucker (Blackie Chan) some more work!",

This is a great, jaw-dropping, eye-popping film that I have seen many times, and it never ceases to impress me.  Everyone slags off Bruce Willis, and, granted, he's made a few bad movies (Mercury Rising anyone?), but given the right film Bruce is always a tour de force (Die Hard, Pulp Fiction).  And boy, is this the right film.  The effects are incredible, the acting superb (Milla Jovovich is a most promising newcomer), the direction flawless.  But its the whole enormity of the vision that gets me, a vision of the future Luc Besson (who surely is God himself) dreamed up when he was 15.  He has now realised this vision, and brilliantly so.  The Fifth Element is very different to Besson's last film masterpiece, Leon, but almost as good in its own weird, futuristic way. This film, for me, has everything; comedy, action, romance, drama and edge-of-the-seat moments aplenty.  I know it's not everyone's cup of tea, I know a few people who hated it passionately, but its in my all time top 10 with Star Wars, Leon, The Princess Bride and The Shawshank Redemption, among others.

Some friends and I went to see it here in the Los Angeles area on a 70mm screen, and in full surround sound. It is one of the older and larger 70mm screens... the theater seats easily 1500 people or more.During Leeloo's resurrection scene, you could hear a pin drop the audience was so quiet. Then as the resurrection was complete and you see the unveiling as a beautiful human woman... you could hear a collective GASP from every guy in the theater! Only a second later you could hear a collective thump of every woman in the theater smacking their husbands/boyfriends/etc.!!!

            "review_title": "The Fifth Element: Save The World Done Right",
            "content": "The Fifth Element directed by Luc Besson is a movie unlike others. The classic \"save the world/universe\" storyline, done right. Many things are incorporated into this movie to make it every genre you could imagine. Mostly classified as a Sci-Fi, some may also say it is a comedy, action, or love movie. Luc Besson has managed to incorporate nature into the future. Many people see the future as chrome. This movie sees it as a ghetto, dirty place where greenery no longer flourishes. Fast food chains and major corporations rule, with practically no trees or natural monuments. A classic, one man, Korben Dallas, must save the future world from a certain doom and find love at the same time. The Fifth Element is a beautiful movie because of its unique presentation of a very common plot.Every save the world/universe movie we know ends and starts the same. A man or woman who is no longer part of any military or government-based program is chosen to save the world. They do not want to do it but they are the \"only ones\" on the earth who can do it. Of course, The Fifth Element takes this concept and uses it, but in a beautiful, never done before way. This movie uses the future with flying cars, unbelievable skyscrapers, space ships, and alien life, and shows a different take on it. These buildings, cars, and even people in major cities and not glamorous and glorified. They are worn-out, run down, and crummy. This is a more realistic interpretation of the future because of the way we are spiraling down. In this movie, Bruce Willis plays a man Korben Dallas, a simple city cab driver and ex-military man, who of course, must save the universe from a certain fatal death. He must go on a cruise ship to find these four \"element stones\" and use them with \"the fifth element\" to save the world from certain death. The antagonist, Zorg, and the protagonist, Korben, are all trying to find the stones to use them for good or to use them for evil. Korben, as well as Zorg, are one of many characters that you find make this movie what it is.Not only is the plot phenomenal, but the characters and their development with the plot as well. The characters in this movie are ones who form the plot to be what it is. I know it's the same in every movie, but for this one practically everyone plays a part. Leeloo, the love interest, is the supreme human being, or in other words, perfect. In this movie, she is first an alien of what is believed to be the divine race, and what is found of her remains becomes reconstructed in a laboratory where when she becomes \"human\" or looks to us what would be \"normal\", you find that she has bright orange hair, a thin figure, and a face with no-make up. Most people would find this unattractive, which is another reason I find this movie so beautiful. It shows true beauty in almost everything. There is another character named Ruby Rhod, who Korben is pretty much partnered up with after \"winning\" the contest hosted by Ruby to win the cruise tickets. Ruby is a radio show host, very popular; whom many would say is metrosexual. He cares very much about his looks and that his show goes well. I would like to think of Ruby as the comedy figure in this film. Other characters such as the priest, his assistant, and even the president all make this movie what it is and all tie it in together. Cornelius, the priest, and his assistant both play a huge role by telling the story of how the evil came to be. Zorg, who is the antagonist of the story, plays a beautiful part. His unique look and superb acting skills help this movie form. From the very beginning of the movie, he plays a very important role of telling what is going on, what he is doing, and how he's going to do it. There are so many beautiful things about this movie, from the actors and their characters, to the graphics and plot. This movie is a must see for everyone because of its wonderful rendition on a common and almost boring plot. In my opinion this movie is going to be a forever sci-fi, action classic. The Fifth Element has a great rendition on a common plot that made it what it is, which is, a beautiful movie.",

The editing keeps the movie well-paced, the characters are cast well-- each supporting character looks like a real human being instead of a model (except the aliens, of course).  The professor, the young Arabic children, the messed up robber in the hall, the stewardi and pilots and ground crew each bring a touch of individuality to the whole.The acting is superb, both main and supporting roles:  Gary Oldman is the perfect villain with exacting delivery of his lines.  The priest and his assistant create a wonderful comic duo and Milla is my choice for the Supreme Being combining innocence and power. Bruce Willis brings his boyish charm to the role of reluctant hero, for once ignored in the face of Ruby Rod, the futuristic love interest of every panting female fan.  His screaming through bombs, barrages of machine guns, and invading aliens all the while oblivious to our heroes' saving the universe keeps the audience laughing out loud.Excellent work by the actors and editors make each scene a delight.

Altogether the plot flows well, and I myself identify with Korben Dallas - a man who is on a downward spiral but still capable of love and self-sacrifice despite the personal risk.

The acting sucked, there was no plot and the whole thing was a disaster.\"So for those of you that missed it; there IS a plot.There is a great evil threatening the world. To stop this evil from eradicating life, four stones have to be arranged and opened with the fifth element (a supreme being) in the middle. The race against time begins for both good and evil to gain possession of these stones. That's a short version of the plot.So while the plot is no masterpiece, I think it's fairly interesting with some really good ideas. I also applaud the makers of 'The Fifth Element' for not totally copying another movie (which is a very common practise these days). The acting was decent; nothing great, but it's good enough not to affect the viewer in a negative way. Special effects were pretty good, so was the scenery and the soundtrack. Sometimes it's hard to understand the dialogue because of the loud music playing at the same time.Oh, some of you might not have noticed it, but this movie is a COMEDY. That means you need to have a sense of humour to enjoy it and that not everything in the movie should be taken seriously. We all know that evil is not an object, so quit whining about the fact that it was represented as a flaming ball. Milla Jovovich might not be the perfect actress to play a supreme being, but then who is? I can't imagine anyone being put in that role without being criticized. Maybe the costumes were a little bit over the top, but come on! What do you expect from a movie where the bad guy is called Zorg? Chris Tucker's character was meant to be annoying, but I think he was funny (and annoying).So 'The Fifth Element' is a great sci-fi/comedy that is fun to watch. Multiple viewings help in understanding the movie better (I've seen it about 5 times).GOOD: A unique movie with action, great visual effects, interesting characters and light atmosphere.BAD: Sometimes the dialogue is hard to understand, due to the loud background music and the acting is not as good as it could have been.RATING: 8/10",

The oter actors include the hilarious Chris Tucker, Ian Holm, and Gary Oldman in his usual type of performance. The cast for this movie is perfect, all of the cast giving brilliant performances. Bruce Willis couldn't be more perfect for this role.The direction in the movie is quite simply, superb. Luc Besson does a fantastic job creating a believeable future, while not out rageous, is quite unique.Overall, this movie is one of those movies that makes you feel good, with great one-liners, excellent actors, and the feeling that the movie doesn't take itself too seriously.3.5\\4",

Milla Jovovich is fantastic, with her fluent \"divine language\" and smokin' hotness. Gary Oldman, ever the chameleon, plays a great villain even if i still can't figure out WHY his character is trying to antagonize the heroes. but the smaller role players practically steal the show. the priest and his assistant are hilarious, the Chinese food guy is funny, but the best performance by anyone in the whole flick is the mugger at korben's (Willis') apartment. it's one of those quick scenes that's memorable enough to become a great inside-joke type voicemail i can leave for any of my friends to make sure they laugh when they hear it.it's a must see. buy it or just never return it to netflix.",

His portrayal of Ruby Rhod was hilarious-almost pants wetting. You'll find yourself telling others of his scenes only to be interrupted by laughter.  The Diva sequence is magnificent.  Her voice is haunting; allowing the viewer to be swept away, eyes closed, to some quiet place of shifting shadows and silver.  The futuristic NY is believable, and the cab is sweet.  Gary Oldman's character is a lame and disturbing.  He seems like some badly dressed, limping, closet gay with a ridiculous accent.  The Mangalores were more evil than him.  A better movie than most give credit. Kudos to the priest and Ruby Rhod, and LeeLoo-they are the true stars of this sci-fi film.",

As previously mentioned the set designs are \"AMAZING\", very original and colourful but never boarders on the ridiculous. This is not easily done! The costumes designed by Jean-Paul Gaultier are truly original, and this along with the very Moebius inspired universe embracing the story, creates a production set that is unrivalled in it's attempt at creating a colourful approach to the sci-fi genre. Furthermore this makes me wonder why Luc Besson is not given the funds to produce large budget movies more often! Obviously the money is well spent.The very humorous approach to the genre, which could have ended up terribly, are also executed very well I think. Bruce Willis has the subtle qualities, that makes him perfect for this movie. He is a man who faces the dangers of the world with a sigh, and a joke closely follows. It is immensely entertaining when he sometimes realises the absurdity of his own situation and just reacts with shrug! Gary Oldman is also hilarious as the evil, but also somewhat pathetic, Zorg. Even Milla Jovovich performs quite well, as the strong hard punching, but also very fragile heroine.In conclusion I find it appropriate to mention that the plot is not flawless, but that this is largely overshadowed by the qualities of this great sci-fi flick!",

            "content": "Chris Tucker's performance as the radio host Ruby Rhod is a lot for the mind to deal with. His manner of speech, appearance, mannerisms, and personality add up to a great deal of mental stimulation. The signal coming off of Ruby Rhod is so high it may be subject to the conceptual equivalent of audio clipping. One might think about a normal person, \"Oh, there they are. I know who that is. I know what they are saying to me. I know why they are moving their body in that fashion.\" With Ruby Rhod, one thinks, \"Ahhh! Oh my God, what is that? Turn it off! Is that a person? What's going on? Someone stop that!\"It is also strange that a radio personality plays such a big part in the plot. If you or I were to make a movie about people in the future meeting aliens and saving the world and so forth we might not think to include a hilarious shrieking gay stereotype.With Gary Oldman's performance as Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg, similar problems occur, though constrained to his accent and the manner in which Jean-Paul Gaultier has dressed him. Some English people, like Mr. Oldman, have an unsophisticated understanding of the English language as it is spoken by Americans.",

Also scored by the very talented Eric Serra (The Professional, Goldeneye), a fitting and pop-orchestral soundtrack took this movie to the next level.

It's not your usual dark moody sci-fi picture, and it has a very unique view of the far future... at times the look is stylized and comic-book-like. At times it is grungy and filled with endless details of the daily drudgery that the denizens face... muggings, garbage disposal, pollution, corruption, security, and overcrowding are all touched upon in ways that make you cringe and giggle at the same time.The parts of the film where multiple conversations and actions are all happening simultaneously (phone booth conversation, ship launch and Ruby's make-out session for example) are particularly well done... the weaving together of different event happening at different locations is seamlessly executed and keeps the action moving without any lulls. Costuming, set, and soundtrack all work together to keep your senses flooded with detail during all of this. The Gaultier costuming... wow... I hope the world never comes to that, but it fit right into the movie and really added to the futuristic feel.Bruce Willis is... well... er.. he's the Die Hard guy transplanted into the future. I guess you can't have it all. I guess they wanted a big star to headline such an expensive production. Milla is great until she starts to speak English... the \"divine language\" she babbles in the first part of the movie is amazing.

Unlike most save-the-world films, this plot does not resolve in an instant with a quick-fix. Characters working together run into difficulty after difficulty, most of which have a little humor thrown in but not enough to destroy the seriousness and suspense that are building.

Instead, I maintain that there is a plot, but also posit that looking to `The Fifth Element' for plot is missing the point.  The film rejoices in itself.  Within the hypercolorful universe of the film, Willis is simultaneously *funny,* sexy, and lethal, and Jovovich is *cute,* sexy, and lethal.  Take the film too seriously and you'll miss that they (especially Willis) are not.  After my recent umpteenth viewing of the film, I realized that I also love it for its editing and framing, which add to the fun comic book feel already inspired by the color and plot, but which I was only recently able to pin down with words.

            "content": "An ancient order, corpse reconstruction, aliens and spaceships; not much more is needed for a perfect 90s sci-fi action film. Yet with all of these elements, The Fifth Element fails to stand the test of time like its other contemporary sci-fi films, such as The Matrix. We begin in a desert learning about ancient aliens who visited earth and the religious order that works to keep in contact with them, giving the overall quest of the film. Suddenly, it's 300 years in the future and our two leads Korben Dallas, Bruce Willis, and Leeloo, Milla Jovovich meet by chance of Leeloo diving off of a building and landing in Korben's taxi cab. Korben has just been introduced as a renegade, tough-as-nails, ex-military-gone-civilian, who is on the verge of losing his license due to reckless driving. Leeloo is a reconstructed alien who turns out to be a really hot woman who remains lightly dressed in the entire film but is a certifiable badass. A cast of stars, what appears to be a sizeable special effect budget, and a well-received director, it had a lot, but somehow The Fifth Element has simply not withstood the test of time. While it is averagely rated at about a C-, I feel that it is only out of the fondness of nostalgia that this movie was not lost as an action film trying too hard to be in the sci-fi genre.\nThe Fifth Element is perfect as a nostalgic movie, under the blurred veneer of childhood memories of the crazy colors and bizarre monsters that seemed so opposite of anything we were seeing, it could really capture your attention. Aside from Tim Burton's Mars Attacks (1996), sci-fi was colorful, but not in the eye-popping way these two were. The use of color in costuming and set creation in the film is easily imprinted in a viewer's brain just after one watch. The color pallet is striking and memorable with bold colors in contrast to the grey and dingy settings. Leeloo's bright orange hair was iconic and a lasting image that could be the only thing you need to know what movie you're watching. If the colors didn't capture you, the characters certainly will. There is Leeloo who barely speaks in a way we can understand but has the most expressive face, and the perfect tough-guy for Korben, and the pinnacle of memorable characters Ruby Rhod played by Chris Tucker. From the entrance of Ruby Rhod, the movie seems to move faster and faster exponentially. Ruby Rhod moves and speaks a hundred miles a minute and the camera position and editing mimic this. The characters and use of the camera for each actor really made them memorable and unique. When Leeloo is panicking from being inside the reconstruction tube, the camera perspective changes and we see the room through Leeloo's eyes as she is still just recovering from being 3-D printed into existence again. The camera is shaky and the image is slightly blurred, and the editing is quick cuts of similar shots in the small space, engaging our fight or flight just as Leeloo. Through this editing and camera work, the viewers are able to be immersed in a character's feelings and point of view.\nWhile these are all wonderful, playful elements that add to the appeal of the movie, the plot and dialogue are pitiful. The theme of the movie comes down to sci-fi with hot aliens and exciting action scenes. This film is action and sex-packed, so much so that after its 126 minute flash of scenes it isn't surprising that the plot remains basic and surface level. At the end of this whirlwind adventure through space and beyond, it seems likely that you'll remember the imagery, colors, and design, but entirely forget or miss key plot points. If you can look past the poorly aged jokes and characterizations and the awkward plot, you can certainly enjoy this film at face value. It is a sci-fi movie whose lead is Bruce Willis, a man who will go on to do The Sixth Sense but ultimately be a great action star. The way Korben says Leeloo will never seem natural and it will always be awkward that Leeloo doesn't get to communicate for nearly the entire movie, but Chris Tucker as Ruby Rhod will always be fun.",

Bruce Willis as the poorly dressed Joe-who-saves-the-world, okay, cool...Yet, the story as a whole didn't really work for me.  I did find it hard to swallow the concept that the \"good\" aliens, who can kill you with a glance, have what is frankly a flimsy spaceship.  The two Gamorrean Guards in the Battlestar Galactica Vipers managed to destroy that without much hassle.  That the Gamorrean Guards turn out to be pretty fragile themselves is another plot hole that undermined my enjoyment.Still, if you like high-concept, go right ahead and disable your brain for a couple of hours and enjoy.  But in the end it joins the legion of similar visually brilliant movies that are ultimately forgettable.  For me, anyway.;) 6/10",

As Tricky, Milla, and even Lee Evans (if ever so briefly) grace the 5th Element, I see no reason not to watch it. Sure bruce willis, doesn't come to mind as the \"hero\" if you were pitched 5th's premise. However his supporting cast more then make up for his sterotyped acting.I especially like the cinematography, even more specific, the use of color contrasts. One one hand you have a movie like Payback, using darker shades, and bright white contrasts. Here you have focus on colors. Each color is brought out in a comic bookish anime setting.5th is a damn good movie..replayability may be on the lower side, but hey, it's got TRICKY DAMNIT!!!!",

Gary oldman is brilliant as the classic villain zorg and Bruce Willis also put in a remarkable performance as the military hardman but milla jovovich steals the show as the kick ass superhuman. I strongly recommend this film even if you don't like sci-fi as unique films like this are extremely hard to come by. I liked this film as the characters made me laugh and there is no film that i know of that matches the fifth element for suspense,action or breathtaking special effects",

However, a lot of hard, smart, dedicated work went into this movie and I do not think that it gets the credit it deserves. Look at the trivia section that IMDb provides for a sampling of the detail that went into this movie. It has a great plot, especially considering that all of the action takes place in one day. The soundtrack is amazing, the characters are great. And how cool is it that throughout the entire movie, the bad guy (Zorg) and the hero (Korben Dallas) never meet? And the movie was edited in an amazing way. I have seen thousands of movies from every genre and have a favorite movies list from here to Timbuktu, and The 5th Element is at the top of my list. It will always be one of my all-time favorites and it will always have a special place in my heart. It just makes me happy no matter what.",

            "content": "I'll start by making it clear that I am not recommending this film as an oscar-deserving classic, but instead as an enjoyable two hours-or-so of cinema. Bruce Willis delivers a performance akin to so many of those he is typecast in. Meaning that he runs around shouting a lot in a vest and sweats. Milla Jovovich is interesting and captivating as Leeloo and one of the film's best scene's occurs when she engages in a well coreographed fight scene to the weird background music of Sarah Brightman's alien diva.\nThe film's best creation however, is Chris Tucker's DJ Ruby Rhod, a fast-talking DJ-cum-TV host of the future who speaks in the films unique futuristic coloquialisms whilst young girls scream around him. Bruce Willis gets to play off of this character a lot in the film, and if you are thinking that a fast-talking DJ-cum-TV host played by Chris Tucker sounds as good a reason as any for NOT watching a movie, I can assure you that you will be pleasantly surprised. The films dialogue is top-notch, I seriously recommend that you see this film at least once. DJ Ruby Rhod: Quiver ladies, quiver!-------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------ DJ Ruby Rhod: What was that honey? It was bad! It had no fire, no energy, no nothing! So tomorrow from 5 to 7 will you PLEASE act like you have more than a two word vocabulary! It must be green! Korben Dallas: Can I talk to you for a second?

It's visually stunning (just look at the vivid colors of the sets and costumes and try to say otherwise), has great pacing and dialogue, and (dare I say?) pretty good acting.  But what about the plot?  I mean, that's what really holds the attention of the viewers, right?  Granted, it's not the most normal story ever told, but then again, that's what makes it stand out. Why, as an American movie-going audience, be subject to the same old cookie-cutter stories that we so often see?  Well that brings up my point.Okay, so I've read the other user comments and I'm a little bit bothered. Half the people really enjoyed this movie, and the other half...well, they fell on the opposite end of the spectrum.  I know I can't change what those people believe, but I think I know what the problem is: the majority of the movie-viewing public HATES anything out of the norm.  People saw Bruce Willis's name on the poster and thought, \"Hey, another great action/adventure movie starring my favorite action/adventure hero!\" Well, sorry...that's not what this is.  And that's why some people didn't like it. They went in expecting one thing, and were totally given the opposite...and it made them mad.  \"How dare they fool us!\" they would say as they finished watching the film.  \"This isn't what I expected!\"  Well, the thing is, if more people would go into a film without preconceptions of how it should be, then they would enjoy it much more immensely.  Okay, now I'm getting off my soapbox.Now my major problem with the movie: the ending.  It seems that after trying to stay away from the norm and trying to give the audience something new and refreshing, Luc Besson felt that he needed a crutch to prop up the ending, basically using an old tried and true storybook resolution.  It kind of dimmed in comparison with the rest of the film, but, oh well.  Let's just say that The Matrix suffered from the same fate.  But despite this, I believe the movie is strong enough to carry its own...9.5/10.0",

From the opening scene, earth, glowing in hue, rising slowly, you know that this is not 'just another movie.' This is a movie someone actually took time with. Took care to get all the detail right, make the screenplay work, keep the graphics toned down... all at once.The Fifth Element pulls this off perfectly. The casting is superb, everyone fits, from Sir Ian Holme, to Chris Tucker (in his first film appearance) to Bruce Willis himself, replaying his role from Twelve Monkeys (another wonderful film), one begins to realise that Willis plays the sensitive character very well indeed. This was teh first Besson film I had seen at this point, and suffice to say, it is his best (Leon, and Le Grande Bleu comming in tied for second).Most stunning though is the plot. At first glance the plot seems like an excuse to have tons of actions scenes, but it's not that way at all. this is a love story, not an action film. But still, it's more then that. It's funny, it's got great one liners (Willis steals the show here), the timming is beyond quesiton some of the best I've ever seen (you'll ahve to see for yourself what I'm talking about). Did I mentiont he cast? Oldman is excellent, playing the villian once more- I'd just like to have seen Jean Reno in this!Back to the plot though, after reading the original screenplay I found that the movie is compltely different. Besson must have been able to see these littlechanges, and added them accordingly, jsut because they feel right (for example, int eh original screenplay, Oldman gets away- but in the movie, he suffers a fate simialir to that he befell in Leon).I could go on for hours, but I wont.

If you can imagine trying to save the world after losing your job, and wife to be all at the same time then you can see what this film was truly about. Corbin Dallas (Bruce Willis) had just ended up losing all the security that he had in life. His wife left him, he got fired, and he had been asked to take on the biggest responsibilities.\nHis endeavor was one of the utmost importance. He needed to solve a puzzle while piecing himself back together along the way. The setting was one that exists 300 years in the future. His acting in the role, I thought was spot on for his current demeanor. He was rather pitiful at first as you realized that his whole life had pretty well fallen apart. A setting that many do experience in life. A dead-end job, no significate other, and the smallest apartment that I think I have ever seen. Corbin was looking for the pieces to put his life back together when all of a sudden, a pretty woman came crashing into his life.\nThe camera angles and slow-motion effects brought the two love birds together in what seemed like an unlikely bond immediately. The music and effects made there first meeting one to remember through the entire film. The Boom you could say. Then the plot thickened when the realization of what must be done set in. They were destined to take on the burden of saving the world, and there was no doubt that it would have be done together.\nThe lighting in each scene made the full effect of the movie stand out. Each scene was displayed in a future-matic format that you can only describe as being present. The props and camera angles drew you into the moments of action and adventure. Each scene encompassed the future right down to alien skin rugs on the floor of paradise. The theme of the movie really fit into each scene as it should.\nIn conclusion, the film was impressive and Leeloo (Milla Jovovich) fit the role perfectly. Her presence alone gave the impression of the will to succeed through the entire film. Corbin could not fail with Leeloo by his side. These two together along with the endeavor they were faced with was plenty enough to keep you guessing at each corner. This film was well done, and I think that all involved did a great job in making the story feel, look, and sound real. No disappointment in the film. Great job!",

Total respect to the author of the story line, without doubt he has captured the heart of many thousands of people and incited logarithmically more, with his insight and imagination. This film i recommend to all film buffs, and i am sure without any doubt will be an all time best. It will always keep me firmly poised watching with intent.",

Or a mistake that was improved well enough to be kept in the movie. I'm not sure which. Plus the action scenes are awesome. And Gary Oldman is Hilarious as Jean-Baptiste Emanuel Zorg (or Mr.Zorg). Very well-cast, excellent action scenes, great special effects, hilariously well-written, and just well-done in general.

            "content": "The end of the 90's. The time when Hollywood began to experience the age of illness of the quality of summer blockbusters. And then - France shows what the American cinema of them, with permission to say, taught. And moreover - it is possible to leave a powerful mark in the history and hearts of the audience of the whole world. And we should be grateful to Luc Besson, a talented person, to whom we should also be grateful for Nikita (film and TV series), a series\"Taxi\" (but not the recent 5th part), \"The Transporter\" and an indisputable masterpiece - \u00abLeon: The Professional\u00bb.The film has become famous for its simple but fascinating plot, the best techniques from the best examples of the Space Opera, which can easily be believed to be a bright and protracting world, references to other representatives of the genre (Star Wars, Alien and Metropolis), a philosophical message, and even some elements from superhero comic books, and this film can fall in love with the current audience of the era of feminism and comic book movies, which makes it similar to the only (I hope for now) success of DC Cinematic Universe - \u00abWonder Woman\u00bb. And if so - we will begin to disassemble the characters from the real main star:Milla Jovovich - The Fifth Element/Leeloomina\u00ef Lekatariba Lamina-Tcha\u00ef Ekbat De Sebat/Leeloo. She is the real gem of this film! The most beautiful being, who besides her beauty and hair falls you in love with her versatility. She was created as a superhero for the whole universe, but remains a living girl with real emotions. He rejoices in the little things of life, but when the debt calls out, she will give rebuff to the evil. Likes fun, but also in her eyes can be serious and thoughtful. On the face like a sincere smile, and tears of pain and fear. With great strength, but no less than a great vulnerability. All these aspects make her a very unique heroine. Which as a girl is stuck and surviving in the jungle (and wear is what the inhabitants of this jungle gave her). With the amendment that these \"jungles\" are metal and with their own laws, which our heroine will have to learn for life here. We, together with her, get acquainted with this world, which helps to compare both girls and boys. But she succeeds with variable success, she finds her own style, knows a lot of amazing things, and, like us, falls in love with this world. But she also has to comprehend one heavy and terrible thing - a war! First physically, and then morally. From what to live as a weapon becomes pain. But in the end - she manages to grow to the point for which she was not created, to find love, meaning and happiness, and at the same time, strength to protect life! Sadly, of course, that after this film, Milla went on to star in the \"Resident Evil\", each part of which merged her soul and potential. But this role still remains many beloved and iconic. Her character is my first love, and forever! She is a pride for France, like the same Wonder Woman for America, and Motoko Kusanagi from Ghost in the Shell for Japan. Favourite female character ever!But our heroine would not be able to find the strength against the Absolute Evil, if not ...Bruce Willis - Korben Dallas. Charismatic, cool, reliable and ... cool! In fact - science fiction version of John McClane, only without the \"Yippee Ki Yay\", but with a cool \"toys.\" His character is tired of life, but acquaintance with Leeloo, also influenced him, as her acquaintance with him. What shows - Love gives strength to life! And it causes him a little envy.(Already Oscar-winner) Gary Oldman - Jean Baptiste Emanuel Zorg. Cool heroes should have - tough villain. Despite the fact that he and Korben did not meet for the whole film, and Leeloo did not even exchange a couple of quotes. He realises that he is a monster, but he considers himself a necessary monster. Colourful, gallant, and ingenious.Ian Holm - Vitto Cornelius. A wonderful actor, who in this film is no less remarkable role. A sort of Obi-Wan Kenobi, though without bond with the Force.And of course - Chris Tucker - Ruby Rod! Genius on the verge of insanity! Each of his sons is filled with insane energy, extravaganza extravagance and an X-smile! All that can be said about him is SUPER! SUPER GREEN!!!But this world is no less attractive. Well-designed models of cities, transport and ships. Colourful scenery. Costumes for the authorship of Jean Paul Gaultier, which makes any character unique. And the creatures that live in this world are Mondashovans and Malgalors. Early George Lucas (who before special editions of the original trilogy of \"Star Wars\", and prequels, respectively) can be proud of them!The film perfectly balances between philosophy and humour. Between light and dark moments. Between fun and sadness. He is practically devoid of boring moments and sagging. A nit-picking level \"Not Malgalors, not Leeloo, not Zorg thought of testing that empty box\" - very petty nit-picking.In short - this is one of my favourite films for me, which certainly should be a place in the top five (if, when I decide to make, of course)! With a fascinating and not sagging plot, the best movie heroine in history, the perfect balance between philosophy and fun, a delectable world and a wonderful aftertaste after every viewing! Ideal entertaining movie!The only thing that upsets (I hope, not only) me is that the universe has not received the proper expansion. After the movie, we got 2 games (one is bad, and the second one may like it), and that's all. I'm not asking for complete sequel, since the director and the main stars are not very good (if they do not decide on the prequel about the past Leeloo). An ideal place for the continuation and expansion of the universe is comic books. I am sure that after the salvation of the world Leeloo will not want to rush to go under the crown. The main thing is to collect the experienced screenwriters, and versatile artists with their beautiful style, which should ideally suit the world of the film (and our Leeloo, of course). And most importantly - that all of them had a strong love for the source. And then Leeloo in comics can compete in popularity even with the Wonder Woman. And now comics can continue the various stories of other cult films. If they have done in this form suitable extensions \"Back to the Future\", \"Big Trouble in Little China\" and \"Fight Club\" (and \u00abBlade Runner\u00bb and did get a decent game), why no one is trying to continue and expand the history of the \"Fifth Element\"? I just do not understand. But - I continue to believe and wait!...I hope we'll meet again, Leeloo. Continue to love and protect this world, our beautiful The Fifth Element...10/10",

It's kind of a \"Heavy Metal\"-esquire thing (think of the cabbie sequence from that movie) mixed with a ton of other influences. I like that it kind of borrows a lot of it's world view from blade runner (in a less dark way, mainly the technology and griminess). This includes the actor who played Leon in that movie playing the military goon come to inform Bruce Willis's character of his re-activation. A great, fun, kind of stupid watch(I mean this in the best possible way) You will find yourself coming back to again and again.

Gary Oldman is fantastic as always -- love the hair.But what made this movie work for me was the art design. For once, we get a look at a technological future that isn't all dark and grim, just a little dirty and patched together in spots.

Up until that point, I've caught pieces of it on TV, and always from the airport scene on, so I'd missed a great deal of it before. I really like this movie. It's a simple plot and pure fun.  Bruce Willis plays his regular Joe hero well, and though I've ever been a fan of Gary Oldman, I admit I like the fact he picked a Southern drawl as his accent. Yes, I'd liken it to Die Hard meets Brazil (especially with the inclusion of Ian Holm in the cast). And it's true that Chris Tucker can be annoying - but I think his over-the-top performance not only suits him but adds a dimension to the film - a foil to the stoic Korbin Dallas character. As for the debate on Milla Jovovich being the Supreme, Perfect Being - I don't think it's a question of her beauty that makes her perfect - perfection, remember, is actually boring. Perfection is about symmetry. Perfection - in this film - is about holding many elements together, about being all encompassing of a great deal of things.  The Fifth Element is strong, smart, capable of reasoning and understanding and, yes, beautiful. But everyone's idea of beauty is as vast as everyone's idea of God, so it is Luc Besson's interpretation.  Besides, I think Milla did an amazing job, especially the way she spoke in that language that is a mix of Italian, French and Latin, from what I could tell. And I've never  been a fan of hers, but my perception of her has been altered by this film. So I think that constitutes a job well done. Plus, I do think this film needs to be viewed with a sense of humor - because that is at the obvious heart of this film. I'd give the film an 8 out of 10, points being docked because I do agree the relationship between Korbin and Leeloo should have been more smoothly developed, but, then again, who's to debate love at first sight?",

We got super stoned in the parking lot beforehand. We knew that Chris Tucker AKA Smokey was in the film and the day was Friday, after school.I loved the idea of flying cars like the one in Back to the Future 2. I became one with that world and bought into the role of Bruce Willis as a lonely futuristic cab driver with a nagging mother. Once the female lead character comes crashing into the film, scantily clad, I fell in love with her, just like Willis's Corbin character did. As she was unable to speak English at first, she conveyed so much life and emotion. The language that she projects is so interesting and I did not learn that the actress developed her own verbal code for the character until much later on.Gary Oldman does well with his role as a futuristic dork antagonist. Chris Tucker provides the right amount of comic relief to off-set the Die Hard- Esque tension. The film also has a special message about love that I will not delve into more in an effort to not be a movie spoiler.",

This is definitely one of my favorites--you can't compare it to anything and you can't take it seriously.  It's the simple tale of good against evil--and many people have been saying that the whole 'love wins' thing is really cheesy.  Well, I have a few theories about that--First of all, I know it was a little bogus, how they were all on love's side but they killed a whole lot of people.  But--'protect life, until death'--they only killed the people who's only mission was to destroy life. It's not perfectly sensible, but close enough.And second of all, when you think about it, love is exactly opposite to evil.  So no wonder it was the element to begin with.  But I like romance in general, so I guess that's just my cheesy-ness shining through. Please--this is just supposed to be a simple, fun, comedy/action with a hint of beautiful romance, and is not to be taken so seriously.  It aggravated people to see that it was being compared to Star Wars, and I agree--Star Wars is a classic, and, well, The Fifth Element isn't, though it always will be for me.I honestly don't see how anyone could hate this movie enough to rate it below a 4.  There's nothing horribly wrong with it, the plot could be patched up but it's not boring or confusing, at least not horribly so.  I could watch this movie over and over if I wanted to, which I would do if it wouldn't classify me as some sort of psycho by all the movie bashers.  Milla Jovovich was amazing, Bruce was pretty good--I hadn't seen many of his movies before this one, Gary Oldman was quite eccentric in his performance and did a good job of being, well, evil.  The costumes were kind of freaky, especially on Zorgs part, but there were no really cheap looking computer special effects--I'm NOT saying they didn't use a computer, I'm just saying they didn't look extremely stupid and out of place, like in some movies I've seen.The movie was, all in all, fun, brilliant, and beautiful, though I think it takes quite an open mind (or maybe just being stupid, as I am) to really like it.  They could have developed the love between Leeloo and Korben, though.  Good movie.  I'd give it at least an 8/10.",

Bruce Willis was brilliant and so was Milla Jovovich who I now will watch in any film. This film was overall one happy zany surprise and it flowed well and had many surprising twists and turns.

The plot is just great, with plot twists that add interest to the film. It is also worth mentioning about many of the rofl moments. They dilute the atmosphere. As far as the acting is concerned, it is pretty good. I think about Bruce Willis a lot of writing is not worth it because he is, as always, on top. What about others? Milla perfectly portrayed the role of Leeloo with all the emotions. But I want to highlight the Chris Tucker played Ruby. THIS IS THE BEST CHARACTER !! Damn, I don't even know how to describe my emotions about Ruby. Is it enough that he's just the best ok?))\nbut there is no such film where everything is fine right? (although I'm not sure lol) in the film, as I think, the aliens were absurd (?) in terms of not their very presence, but how they look. Although do not forget that the film was filmed in 97 so it's not surprising. By the way, the last scene with Leeloo and Korben was very unexpected and cool (whoever disagrees, agree))\nWELL\nI bet 8/10. Because of the stupid aliens and the open ending.

The sheer random absurdity and the wacked way that the characters deal with the bizarre situations they find themselves in really appealed to my sense of the bizarre.  The story is not exactly War and Peace, but it really doesn't need to be.  It's more about the amazing visual spectacle, and the really weird people, and watching veteran scene stealer Gary Oldman have a ball than anything else. Bruce Willis does quite a good job in a silly hero spot, and the giant metal turkeys do a good job too, in their underwritten but crucial roles.  It's really the throwaway moments that are the best in this.  I think one of my favorite moments is the juiced thief with a picture of the hallway on his head breaking into a bizarre dance, but one cannot discount the cockroach with the camera, the frozen military personnel (Hail, Replicant!), and the little elephant animal thingy.  I never cease to be amused by Chris Tucker's amazing Ruuuuuuby Rhod!  And the opera diva!  And those weird and none-to-bright aliens with the big ears!  And the deaf pop star! Explosions!

The dialogue is witty and fantastically silly, but so well delivered. I'd be surprised if you didn't come out of this film with several good one-liners(ex:\"cheekan...good\"). The action sequences are cleverly mixed with electronic and middle eastern style music pieces that beg to be danced to. You have to be made of stone not to love the Diva's performance, which ultimately won me over on the film. There are several sequences that make prodigious use of seamless parallel cuts(also very funny). And if all this wasn't enough, there are the sets. They're like, Blade Runner and the amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat! It's a mix of old and new(cars look quite 20's, and I'm sure you notice a particular modern day fast food franchise), not to mention the costumes, which combine the best of scifi imagination with some kind of mind-altering drug.

Maybe if they kept the story in the past, the archaelogical stuff...that had more human interest. The female lead has an annoying voice.",

Chris Tucker is laugh-out-loud funny as the dim-witted, vain Ruby Rhod.  Gary Oldman is deliciously sinister as Zorg.  And Bruce Willis is sarcastic and gritty as our hero, Korben Dallas.  The film is set in a mind-boggling future with body rebuilding, interstellar travel, and, of course, flying cars.  The plot (to make it short: defeat the bad guy, use the weapon against evil, save the world) is quick and keeps you on the edge of your seat.  If you have the misfortune of being someone who has not seen this film, I would reccommend that you go rent it.",

If you are a fan of the sci-fi genre, there is a lot to like in the film. As a sci-fi buff, I really enjoyed the imaginative scenery (luxury liners in space). It is always interesting to see how writers and directors view life in the future. The pace was fast and the action relatively believable. Bruce Willis' Korbin Dallas character was entertaining, and could anchor a series of similar films. Milla Jovovich was definitely eyecatching, and Chris Tucker was absolutely hilarious as Ruby Rhod. One thing that I enjoy about futuristic sci-fi movies is that the future is going to be anything but boring. Good job Mr. Besson, keep up the good work.",

I think it is one of the best berformances of Willis, Oldman and Jovovich. The movie is packed, every scene is thought through. Color and costume (Gaultier himself) language makes the movie modern, light and positive (instead of heavy and dark as many other sci fi movies). The Diva performance is hypnotizing, and ending with the elements of EDM (1997!), wich really went into main steam 20 years later.I just like the movie. In its simplissity it has very strong charactre and depth. And i still got goose pumps and also some tears. 10p!",

With \"Le cinqueme element\", Luc Besson and Eric Serra reached the peak of their companionship through many years- together with an almost perfect cast and crew. I've seen the film a dozen times, and it still manages to fascinate me. The score, composed by ever-so-fulfilling Eric Serra, is well thought through and enjoyable listening to- even without the motion picture to accompany it.

The visual effects (especially those of the city) and alien designs are stunning and quite creative. Chris Tucker, although annoying at times, provides quite a bit of humor later in the film. I was surprised, however, that it was not the action packed adventure that I had expected. But, I was also not disappointed by the lack of action as the story (for me) kept the film going. Most of the real action takes place in the last bit of the movie. The only real mystery is how Luke Perry managed to get a title credit for 5 minutes of screen time.",

From the outlandish costumes to the well thought out alien creatures the visuals ooze style.The story, although sometimes a little shallow, is in itself a great good versus evil battle without giving you the feeling that you've seen it somewhere before.Bruce Willis carries his usual tough guy, action-man character into the film without once looking out of place - this was the one actor I thought could have ruined the feel of the movie.

Moreover, this pile of scene clutter is so inartistic that I really felt intellectually insulted. But the costumes must have been good right?

BTW, I'm not a Bruce Willis fan.\nAlso, the sci-fi \"alternate world\" consistancy is excellently done. Almost none of the features of this alt world are explain how they work or why they came to be, everything makes sense. Nothing seems out of place and no one, not once acts out of character, not once. A supreme achievement for a sci-fi movie.The characters, including the supporting cast are excellent. Each has some quirky thing going and they all pull off their characters so well. Gary Oldman's \"mercenary gun seller's\" pitch to prospective buyers is hilarious.\nAll in all, it is great fun. Do not pass on seeing it on the big screen (perhaps at a local campus?) if you ever get the chance, it is one of the few sci-fi movies that is worth the ticket price (if not more) these days.",

The way Luc Besson seemlessly threads elements of science fiction, comedy, drama, action, romance and thriller genres is of great credit to the man. Simultaneously, he sends us a strong message on the value of life and tells us a cracking story.The look of the film is also spot on, with seemless special effects that are visually stunning but blend seemlessly into the backdrop (the car chase is a must see scene from the moment leeloo steps off the ledge) . Casting, too, is excellent as Bruce Willis is one of the most talented and underrated actors in Hollywood and sparks brilliantly with Milla Jovovich and especially Chris Tucker.If you haven't seen this film, get it now.

There are several aspects to this movie that make it, in my opinion, one of the coolest movies ever screened.  Let's start with the cast.... Bruce.  John Mclaine.  THE man from Die Hard.  'Nuff said. Milla Jovovich.  She actually learned a language invented for this movie. Someone told me she would write notes to Luc Besson in it.  Oh, did I mention she's one of the best looking women on the planet? Gary Oldman.  He had the greatest part of all.  Jean-Baptiste Emanuelle Zorg.  Is that a cool name for a bad guy or what?  He's one of those characters that no one else could play.  Pick your own example. Chris Tucker.  Ruby Rhod, inter-galactic radio host.  This guy's wardrobe is reason enough to see the movie.  Bzzzzzzzt! The soundtrack..... Eric Sera (see \"Goldeneye\") put the music to this one.  His score is beyond cool and compliments the film exceptionally, punctuating each scene with exactly the right tempo.  Seamless integration.

            "content": "One of my favorite movies of all time. Ravishing sets, gorgeous costumes (Jean Paul Gaultier), beautiful cinematography (Thierry Arbogast), grandiose soundtrack (Eric Serra), and an excellent story. Acting was, umm... more than sufficient.The story has been outlined elsewhere, but a synopsis of it would be \"world is gonna' end, gotta' save it, fantastic odds to be overcome...and fall in love\".The visuals, story, and pacing in this movie are timeless, just like 1979's \"Alien\", and 1982's \"Blade Runner\" (both Ridley Scott) -in that the level of quality in the cinematography and editing allows them to be comparable to the best of movies produced today. It's not just about digital FX, it's about art.There isn't a moment where you feel the urge to fast forward past the \"boring parts\" as the pacing is quite solid. Each shot is beautifully composed and filmed, as there are no \"junk\"  or \"filler\" shots to be found in this film.The score is excellent, Eric Serra is a master of orchestration, on par with Elfman, albeit completely different styles.The story is quite fantastic -maybe even preposterous, I'll give you that, but it is a sci-fi romantic comedy. I don't think it aspires to be more than what it is, with the simple premise of good versus ultimate evil, that can only be defeated by the strength of love.Although, if you are used to American films and could care less about beauty in films, then don't bother watching this. If you have any care for film at all, see this in one of its wide-screen versions -you are literally missing half the film if you watch pan-and-scan (most movies).If you liked this movie at all and haven't yet seen \"La Femme Nikita\" or \"Leon\" (the butchered version of this is known as \"The Professional\" here in the US), then rent them both (wide-screen, please).",

There are some superficial resemblances to the excellent \"Blade Runner\", but the only real connection is Brion James, who was excellent in the earlier film and terrible here.  The film is more like a Saturday morning cartoon than a comic book.  I got really sick of the endless gunfights in which Bruce Willis hits the mark with every bullet, but the bulldog/pig-headed aliens can't hit anything.  And the motivations are inexplicable.  Why would anyone take a payoff to help someone who is trying to destroy the universe? Where does Zorg think he's going to spend that money?  And when we finally get to the climactic moment, and Bruce Willis says, \"I love you\", my reaction was, \"Why?  You've only spent about three minutes with her over the course of the film, she's only uttered about a half-dozen words that you were able to understand, and the one time you showed affection toward her, she pulled a gun on you.\"At least I saw this on DVD for free.",

Cab driver Korben Dallas (Bruce Willis) unexpectedly find himself in the middle of a race to find the only weapon that can save them-the five elements of earth, wind, fire, water, and the 5th element the divine being Leeloo (Milla Jovovich). The film starts in a sanctuary in the early 1900's in Egypt. An Earth-friendly group called the Mondoshawan land outside the sanctuary to retrieve the stones in order to keep them safe from the evil that returns every 5,000 years. The movie skips to present time when the Mondoshawan spaceship is returning the Fifth Elements to Earth during the crisis of the shadow planet advancing to destroy Earth but is destroyed by the Mangalores who are working for the ruthless Zorg (Gary Oldman). All hope was thought to be lost but a group of scientists discover traces of the Fifth Element's DNA and are able to rebuild it in a regeneration chamber. What they weren't expecting was that the Fifth Element would be the perfect specimen of a woman, Leeloo. Leeloo then escapes the lab and jumps to what you believe is her death until she falls through the roof of a cab driven by Korben Dallas. Korben Dallas helps Leeloo evade the police through a flying car police chase ending at his New York apartment. That is where their adventure begins as Leeloo has informed Korben she must find Father Vito Cornelius (Ian Holm) to save the Earth. Korben is then shocked to find that he has won the Gemini Croquette Contest that he did not enter. General Munro of the Federated Army shows up at Korben's apartment to inform him that he has been reenlisted into the Army and the contest was rigged to ensure Korben is sent to Fhloston Paradise to retrieve the four element stones from their contact, Diva Plavalaguna (Maiween Le Besco). Father Cornelius hits Korben on the head, taking Leeloo and the contest tickets in hopes of taking his place at Fhloston Paradise. Korben finds Leeloo and Father Cornelius, taking back the tickets and departing for Fhloston Paradise. Thus begins their mission to save the Earth.",

Leeloo is the fifth element, the \"ultimate weapon against evil\", the only hope Earth has. On her journey, Leeloo encounters many different people. Korben Dallas (Bruce Willis) becomes entangled with the mission when Leeloo literally falls into his cab. He is portrayed as a hero along with Leeloo. They need to retrieve the \"stones\" before the antagonist of the story, Jean-Baptiste Emanuel Zorg (Gary Oldman), gets his greasy hands on them and destroys all mankind. Leeloo goes through a very personal challenge near the end of the movie. After being shot at and attacked she realises humans have a nasty side that she doesn't understand. She looks up \"war\" on the internet and is horrified by the images that come up. She has been sent to Earth to protect this race that partial to destruction. She doubts her mission until Korben explains love to her and that no matter how little of it there is, love is worth protecting.I love this movie and the challenges Leeloo faces.

It is an ACTION drama/comedy and some people have a hard time with that because they expect Star Wars. It isn't Star Wars. It's Shawn of the Dead meets Sci Fi, funny but serious and poignant. An attention to detail really sets a good sci-fi apart from the bad and if you watch this you will know the difference.

Had I seen all of the movie, I would probably have re-thought my list of Top 5 Worst Ever.Since that list was formed in my head before IMDB came along, I've never checked out what other folks thought about the films I would place there, so I immediately thought, \"Let's see what people have to say about 'Fifth Element.'\" Imagine my surprise to find very favorable - no, I'd say \"glowing\" - comments about this dogpile of a movie. I respect anyone's right to an opinion, especially about a creative field like movie-making, but I just have to suggest that either I or they were smoking some serious crack while watching it, because there is no way we're talking about the same two hours of our lives.Oh, wait, they are talking about that shrill, unfunny Ruby Rod character (compares to Jar Jar Binks in extreme annoyance, now that I think about it), so I guess we saw the same movie. Now, I like odd, off-key movies as much as the next \"World According to Garp\" or \"How to Get Ahead in Advertising\" fan, but I honestly have to say that \"Fifth Element\" ranks up there on the Worst Ever list with \"Orlando,\" \"Spaceballs\" and \"Full Metal Jacket.\" (Yes, I am a Kubrick fan, so describing his too-little/too-late \"wasn't Vietnam a bad thing?\" brutality festival a Worst Ever film is painful.)In short, sometimes Weird is Good, but sometimes Weird just plain Stinks.",

This is what we need to see more in the movie industry. Too many directors play it safe, and don't push the boundaries. The classics Blade Runner and Alien gave us a darker, dirtier future. So what about the other side of the coin (or Multi-pass)? The '90's brought us too many look-alike movies with horrible plot lines, stupid science and unimpressive set design and costumes (remember Event Horizon!).If you're going to design a sci-fi film, show me something new, fresh and thought provoking. This movie has it in spades! Lots of stuff you've never seen before, like flying taxis during daylight hours, no rain but sunny skies in a future New York built hundreds of feet below street level (the ocean level dropped hundreds of feet, and the city built downward!), costumes look fantastic and sexy ( thanks to Jean Paul Gauthier) and even Milla's spoken language is freaky. And it's Sarah Brightman who sings the operetta!Even if the story isn't earth shattering, the film works well, and the chemistry between the actors is great. It's even refreshing to see Bruce shift acting gears to a more subdued tone. He's a modest hero in this film, which works fine . Overall, this film does what few sci-fi films do today, it gives you a feeling of awe and wonder at the future.",

He can play a guy who blows the doors off of the \"bad guys\" and a nerd who is more scared of his \"dead\" wife than he is of how mediocre he's become, and a psychiatrist who counsels disturbed children and you believe him in each of the roles. From the Gaultier clothes to the fine Shakespearean actors to the force that is Chris Tucker to the wonderful \"language\" spoken by Leeloo, it's a great thoroughly entertaining funny ride.I loved it.",

The Fifth Eelement keeps you riveted to the edge of your seat with action packed scenes throughout the movie while bringing a grace and elegance amidst the chaos with a singing voice equal only to Sarah Brighton.

Did I mention that the Blue Lady can sing with a powerful yet wonderfully melodic voice? OK, so it's part the marvel of high tech movie making, still, what a voice.If you get what you pay for, then you definitely get your money's worth with the Fifth Element.",

The special effects may have been state of the art for the time but they have been so eclipsed now to render the cities in the sky as pie in the sky and the attempt at gender-bending may have been funny twenty years ago but borders on the offensive now. It was when I got to the part in which the supreme being after surfing the internet and learning the moves performed a Bruce Lee fight sequence I knew it was downhill all the way.

The sci fi action was done quite well in many scenes too. Ian Holm, Gary Oldman, Tommy Lister Jr., Lee Evans, and Brion James were all noteworthy cast members as well, as they are in everything. This came out the year I was born and it's hard to believe how far these kinds of movies have come, yet they won't make movies quite like this again and it's a little special because of that.",

I adored the concept and the story even with the lack of flow never failed to intrigue.\n\nThe script and satire are fun and slick, the visuals are breathtaking and unusual especially the amazing Big Apple effects with honourable mention to the camp trip to the resort planet Fhoston Paradise and there are plenty of thrills and imagination in the atmosphere to be had.\n\nBesson's direction is excellent, Eric Serra's music is atmospheric and jaunty and the characters are fun.

            "content": "As the credits rolled at the end of The Fifth Element earlier today (the first time I'd ever seen it incidentally) I had to check Luc Besson's Imdb page. I was pretty sure he'd made many films since The Fifth Element, but my initial reaction was confusion. How had he managed such a back catalogue when whoever wrote The Fifth Element must have surely been sectioned immediately on the films release? \nOf course I should have realised earlier than I did, Besson was a producer on Taken and I've actually seen many of his films since The Fifth Element that I've inexplicably quite liked (Lockout, 2012, Lucy, 2014). Not to mention the fact that Besson was behind Leon (1995), undoubtedly his masterpiece to date.\nThe more I thought about the film, the more I liked it. It's Blade Runner on so many drugs that the death knell should be imminent, but the final blow never comes. The invention in the film is second to none, the early flying car chase is thrilling and the visuals back up its $93,000,000 budget. I was reminded of several films as well as Blade Runner, Terry Gilliam's Brazil (1985) is a touch point, and Star Wars is absolutely in the fabric of the film. The big difference between this and Star Wars however, is that The Fifth Element doesn't take itself seriously at all, and in that respect you feel fine laughing at it. When Star Wars is silly, you get frustrated at the fact that people take it very, very, very seriously. The presence of Ian Holm also reminds you of Alien (1979), and there's even a nod to Moonraker (1979) at the films conclusion. What also must be mentioned are the performances. Sure, Bruce Willis plays John McClane in what must now be looked back at as The Fifth Die Hard (that's a really good joke if you appreciate the 5th Die Hard film shouldn't exist for crimes against cinema) but Gary Oldman and Chris Tucker almost walk off with the film with outrageously brilliant performances. It's also highly amusing when Bruce Willis tells police he is not a human, he is identifying as a meat popsicle; and as a result avoids arrest. One wonders when The Fifth Element is inevitably released for a 25th anniversary next year, whether that joke is vaporized from existence to avoid inescapable offence. Deranged doesn't even begin to describe The Fifth Element, amongst scenes of cinematic carnage there are breathtaking visuals and wonderful performances. The only way to make your own mind up is to see it.",

            "content": "Enjoyable space romp with some dated elements.\n\nLuc Besson's science-fiction adventure comedy The Fifth Element (1997) is a truly deranged piece of cinematic history from the now infamous French filmmaker Besson. It starts off with an ultra serious sci-fi set-up only to immediately turn into a buddy comedy with some romantic comedy territory in the midst of this sci-fi adventure. I think Luc Besson directed a real classic with Leon: The Professional, but The Fifth Element is merely a fun movie. The CGI effects are really dated and corny. The dialogue is clunky and filled with pointed sci-fi jargon and exposition to justify nonsense on screen. There's so many cringe moments that don't work, especially with the jarring editing that's so late 90's, it's absurd. Overall, watch The Fifth Element for the Bruce Willis parts and I'm sure most viewers will find Milla endearing as the \"perfect\" woman Leeloo.\n\n It's quite funny and action packed due to Bruce Willis' charm as the taxi driver turned universal savior with a crush on the beautiful Milla Jovovich. Willis certainly elevates this picture with a charismatic leading man aura, funny comedic timing, and intense dramatic skill that he uses in bursts here and there. Jovovich is fun and playful with moments of tender vulnerability as Leeloo. I love her delivery of nonsense divine language talk that sounds like Latin, French, and Italian all at once. She's got nice chemistry with Willis. I do find it creepy that Besson left his wife for her, who he dated since she was 12 when he was 29. Besson infantilizes Leeloo with the baby talk and weird outfits too. It's even stranger to think that the blue diva opera singer is played by Luc Besson's wife at the time. The Fifth Element is truly strange.\n\nI have to mention Chris Tucker is just overacting the entire movie. He shows up more than halfway through as this gross parody of a drag queen with an obnoxious scream. He just shouts horrible dialogue and repeats himself with awkward buzzing and incessant yelling. I found maybe 5 lines of his funny with the rest nearly ruining The Fifth Element. In a movie with Gary Oldman chewing the scenery with his awful haircut and over the top Southern accent, Tucker is still more flamboyant and outrageous. This is seriously a strange picture, but many of the dated or annoying elements might be fun upon revisiting for new viewers.\n\nIn short, I cannot hate The Fifth Element. It tries so hard to make interesting sci-fi concepts out of nowhere, thrilling action sequences, and pleasant comedic adventures around space. I think Bruce Willis really saves The Fifth Element overall, but Milla Jovovich brings a realistic warmth. The scene where Leeloo watches war footage should be corny, but her tears make it a raw, emotional moment. Bruce Willis really used to try once upon a time.",

Great production values, great special effects, and some of the actors, like Chris Tucker and Bruce Willis, even put in some good performances.  However, I think the story and humor fall entirely flat for me.  There's not much realistic or creative about it considering it takes 300 years in the future.  I can't comprehend the audience score, because the audience is often more right about these things.  The critics score is too high because critics contradict practical reason.  In contrast, I much preferred the original Total Recall.  That movie had a cool little story, it was futuristic and held up way better.  So in conclusion, I can't stand this movie.  Unless I'm in a situation around a bunch of brain dead people watching this, I will absolutely never watch this again of my own free will.  The half star it gets is the credit I give it for special effects and some actors putting in hard work who have nothing to do with the epic atrocity that is this movie.  Do not waste your time. ",

            "content": "I had heard so many positive reviews of this film from people I respect including my beloved parents and so when I sat down to watch it with my family I was fully prepared to love it. I found that I admired it but I don't think it's on the level of 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) or Blade Runner (1982), although my mother would disagree on the latter, and I didn't feel passionate about it. The visual style, from the costumes to the special effects, were distinctive and beautiful and the direction was great as most of the film is mesmerizing. I would definitely recommend that people see the film and I would praise it for managing to balance a comedic tone with serious science fiction. The 1990s produced a lot of great films and I don't personally believe this reaches those heights but it's still a hugely enjoyable experience.\n\nKorben Dallas, Bruce Willis, is a taxi driver who has the \"Fifth Element\" fall into his taxi in the form of Leeloo, Mila Jovovich, who he immediately falls in love with and protects against the police. Priest Vito Cornelius, Ian Holm, has been waiting for the fifth element to appear since 1914, the film is set in 2263, and helps to educate Leeloo when Korben brings her to his door. The major villain is Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg, Gary Oldman, who is under the control of the great evil and faces death if he is not able to attain the stones that will cause the great evil to be destroyed if combined. As the love between Korben and Leeloo continues to grow they have even more incentive to prevent the world from ending due to the great evil.\n\nJean-Paul Gaultier, legendary French fashion designer, was employed to design the costumes for the characters in this film and it shows as we see Willis in an orange mesh halter top one minute and Jovovich in \u00e2~bandages' the next. The whole affair has a French affectation to it that makes it look wonderfully outrageous and sophisticated, it's brightly colored and ostentatious but always classy. Along with this the visual style of the entire film is insane, it has touches of Logan's Run (1976) but is also all it's own. The flying cars, the concert halls and the villain's lairs are all lavishly set up and create a world that feels very constructed and self-conscious but so what? It's a wonderful, psychedelic vision straight out of Besson's head.\n\nThe performances were good enough for a film that requires them to do very little but I feel that Oldman was not particularly good as a villain. I had heard so much about how iconic this performance is and how scary but campy he manages to be. I just thought that his Southern accent was poor and he wasn't serious or campy enough to be very entertaining. The better respected British actor playing a villain in a Bruce Willis action movie was Alan Rickman in Die Hard (1988) as he is genuinely chilling but also funny in all of his little idiosyncrasies. Seeing Jovovich be used properly as an action lead was nice despite her being objectified at points and she manages to give the character she plays more personality than I imagine was on the page. Willis is solid and has nice chemistry with Jovovich and it was funny to see Holm in the same year as his brilliant performance in The Sweet Hereafter (1997) which is far more serious in it's tone.\n\nI didn't emotionally engage with the characters in the way I would have liked to, maybe it was the comedic tone and I don't think the film is trying to ask the sort of philosophical questions that Blade Runner is. It was because of this that I found the film to be entertaining but empty and even as I cheered at the sight of Korben and Leeloo engaging in physical contact in the pod at the end of the film I wasn't moved. That should not be a requirement for a film, some films exist purely to entertain and thank goodness but it is because of that that I don't see this as the classic that some people do.",

            "content": "In 1914, aliens known as Mondoshawans arrive at an ancient Egyptian temple to collect, for safekeeping from World War I, the only weapon capable of defeating a great evil that appears every 5,000 years. The weapon consists of four stones, containing the essences of the four classical elements, and a sarcophagus containing a Fifth Element in the form of a human, which combines the power of the other four into a divine light capable of defeating the evil. The Mondoshawans promise their human contact, a priest from a secret order, they will come back with the weapon in time to stop the great evil when it returns. In 2263, the great evil appears in deep space in the form of a giant ball of black fire, and destroys an attacking Earth spaceship. The Mondoshawans' current contact on Earth, priest Vito Cornelius (Ian Holm), informs the President of the Federated Territories about the history of the great evil and the weapon that can stop it. As the Mondoshawans return to Earth they are ambushed by Mangalores, a race hired by the industrialist Jean-Baptiste Emanuel Zorg (Gary Oldman), who has been directed by the great evil (sending messages as Mister Shadow) to acquire the element stones. The Mondoshawans' spacecraft is destroyed, and the only \"survivor\" is a severed hand in a metal glove from the Fifth Element's sarcophagus that still contains some living cells. Human scientists take it to a New York City laboratory where they use it to reconstruct a powerful humanoid woman who takes the name Leeloo (Milla Jovovich). Terrified of the unfamiliar surroundings, she breaks out of confinement and jumps off a high ledge, crashing into the flying taxicab of Korben Dallas (Bruce Willis), a former major in the special forces. Dallas delivers Leeloo to Cornelius and his apprentice, David, and it is revealed that she is the Fifth Element. Cornelius learns from her that the element stones were not on the Mondoshawans' ship, but had been entrusted to an alien opera singer, the diva Plavalaguna. Zorg kills many of the Mangalores for their failure to obtain the stones, but the survivors determine to seize the artifacts in revenge. Learning from the Mondoshawans that the stones are in Plavalaguna's possession, General Munro (Brion James), Dallas' former superior, recommissions Dallas and orders him to travel undercover to the planet Fhloston to meet Plavalaguna in a flying luxury hotel..\n\nThe Fifth Element polarised critics on release. Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times described the film as an \"elaborate, even campy sci-fi extravaganza, which is nearly as hard to follow as last year's Mission: Impossible.\" He concluded that The Fifth Element was \"a lot warmer, more fun and boasts some of the most sophisticated, witty production and costume design you could ever hope to see.\" On film review show At the Movies, both Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel gave the film a \"thumbs up\"; in his own review for the Chicago Sun-Times, Ebert gave the film 3 stars out of 4, calling it \"One of the great goofy movies\", and concluding, \"I would not have missed seeing this film, and I recommend it for its richness of imagery. But at 127 minutes, which seems a reasonable length, it plays long.\" The film was, however, subject to a number of harsh reviews that expressed disapproval of its overblown style. Todd McCarthy of Variety wrote, \"A largely misfired European attempt to make an American-style sci-fi spectacular, The Fifth Element consists of a hodgepodge of elements that don't comfortably coalesce.\" David Edelstein of Slate was even more critical, saying, \"It may or may not be the worst movie ever made, but it is one of the most unhinged.\"\n\n\"The Fifth Element\" is a poor poor sci-fi actioneer from Luc Besson which I saw at the movies when it came out. I remember reading about the fact that Luc Besson was going to make a sci-fi movie and how excited I was about that. But, my vision of this film was a cross between the dystopian and dark \"Blade Runner\" and something Moebius would draw. \"The Fifth Element\" is nowehere near this at least. This film is a pretentious multi coloured muppets in space saga with a wobbly storyline, wobbly acting, wobbly lines and it is just way too slapsticky for me. The characters are all one-dimensional and  flat as a wooden door. Bruce Willis seems lost, Chris Tucker is beyond annyoing, Gary Oldman is Herr Flick on drugs and Milla Jovovich adds not much to the film. Yes, some of the set designs are quite ok for being a 90s production and the vibe has something in it. But, nevertheless my verdict has not changed. I hated it when it came out, and I still hate it.",

Actually the movie exceeds my expectations. It's a thoroughly gleeful sci-fi/action romp brimming with creativity; marvellous inventive visuals, distinctive style and idiosyncratic tone, and splendid and utterly unique world-building.\n\nThe characters are quite relatable, and well-developed and have some reasonable depth into them, especially Leeloo, who brought to life by Milla Jovovich. Bruce Willis showed his solid action chops and plenty of stamina and charisma to make Korben Dallas a quite likable hero. Gary Oldman plays the villain of the movie, Zorg, and I think that his fantastic over-the top performance is more than enough to elevate his rather uneven character that was hindered by the decline of the plot's cleverness.\n\nThe movie also has an awesome utilization of its electrifying soundtrack in the action sequences, which are pretty cool!\n\nThe Fifth Element is a helluva fun time; but that doesn't necessarily mean it's dumb at all. In fact the movie has some surprisingly deep moments that work pretty well despite the fact that Luc Besson never wanted us to take his movie seriously. I can see now why many fans hated Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets!\n\n(8/10)",

The Fifth Element uses one of the newest tricks in the science fiction motion picture handbook: perform a visual and aural assault on viewers in the vain hope that they won't notice the lack of substance, logic, and intelligence. For a few recent examples of where this tactic has been employed, check out Stargate and Independence Day. The Fifth Element, the summer of 1997's first big-budget disappointment, is right at home in such company. A lot of money was spent on this film, but $100 million doesn't guarantee a good product. Maybe someone should have thought of spending a few more dollars on a better script. Once The Fifth Element's assault on the senses starts to wear off, it's easy to become restless. After all, in keeping with the \"epic\" sweep demanded by such an obese budget, the film had to clock in at over two hours, even though there's no excuse for a movie with so little going on to last for so long.

            "content": "Visually unique, content wise cheap\nFrom a visual point of view, this film is one of the most impressive of my life, every second looks like a painting. The movie sets the colors the props everything is beautiful. Although I do not always like the costumes and I want to ask a few questions in some design decisions, I would say that the movie is a masterpiece. (From a visual point of view)\nBut then he is pulled down by the fact that the script looks as if it had written a small child or comes from a children's book. The narrative style, the narrative structure everything is cooked really soft and fade the characters are quite okay but the dialogues are, please do not misunderstand, too stupid for science fiction. Especially during the climax I had the feeling that every moment \"Dora the Explorer\" shows up and asks for me help.\n\nHowever, I think Dora got lost in the plot holes, no plot caves. Not every story has to be infinitely complicated but if you make a movie out of it, we expect it to be a movie and if this movie has a PG-13, then I'll rate that as well. I am against the age restrictions, but even as a 13 year old boy would this cheap narrative + black and white representation of good and evil bother me tremendously.\n\nThe story is the most important thing that makes a good movie and when I get such a \"My Little Pony Fanfiction\" that even my 5 year old cousin finds miserable mixed with costumes and furniture that belong in a museum, then I get headaches, depressions and gripes at the same time. I think it's a pity that all these wonderful set pieces and technological details are stuck between this crap of script. I'd rather have a movie with a fantastic script and awful flaws than the other way around.\n\nBruce Willis is fantastic as always he could play a Nazi and I would still like the man. Chris Tucker is unbearable but Milla Jovovich has anything in this performance which just fills me with hate.\nI do not know what it is, whether it's her voice her costume or the way she talks like a baby, something annoys me so much that I always want to skip her parts because I'm afraid I'm going to go crazy. I like Gary Oldman but here he is totally wasted in this movie Zorg is a totally superfluous character that has no (major) impact on the course of the story.\n\nIt's also really difficult to assign a fixed genre to this movie, what is it? Is this Comedy Action, SciFi Action, SciFi Comedy? Is it satire, is it serious or a costume orgy?\n\nPS: A lot of people like that the protagonist and antagonist never meet firstly Zorg is not the antagonist but only a lackey from the real villain, we never met our hero, Korben Dallas do not know about Zorg's existence or its influence the whole thing. That's why it's not worth mentioning.\nI like that the film has a theme of 5 that is a nice Easter Egg what I did not notice the first time.But on the other hand film has two TV troops I loathe as a solution to the problems.\n\nMy conclusion: applause for Luc Besson ideas and cinematography but I can do without his films.",

Chris Tucker does give a good performance Ruby Rhod, but his character is way too over-the-top, which is saying something considering the rest of the movie, and honestly he's just unintentionally annoying.

The movie is very funny and Chris Tucker is one of the best parts of this movie with his hilarious persona.

He goes to get the stones and when he finally reaches his ship he opens the case and there not there it's classic. \n\nHighly recommend this! It's action packed, funny as hell, great opera/music throughout and the sets that were created with technology in the late 90s makes its pop.

Like the rest of Besson's filmography, The Fifth Element is jam packed with visual style and flair, amplified even more so this time due to the sci-fi nature of the film, but never sacrifices the integrity of the story or characters. The tale of Korben Dallas and Leeloo may not pack the same punch as the stories of Nikita or L\u00e9on and Mathilda, but the two are likeable enough to keep things engaging. The performances from Bruce Willis and Milla Jovovich certainly help in that regard. Willis brings the same charisma seen in his performance(s) as John McClane, and makes for a charming yet physically capable lead. It's Jovovich who really shines, though: Leeloo is endlessly adorable, often painfully so, but, like Korben Dallas, she packs a punch when necessary. Jovovich manages all of this with an amazing performance that often requires little or no dialogue (she doesn't even speak English until midway through the film). Gary Oldman also turns in a delightfully hammy performance as the film's villain, akin to his performance in Besson's The Professional. Besson's direction is as sharp as ever, and the part-Blade Runner part-French comics inspired visuals he's added this time hold up really well. The Fifth Element is another solid entry in Besson's filmography.",

Bruce Willis is great in this, and Milla Jovovich is not that bad in this. The effects are still fantastic to look at, I like the worlds that the filmmakers created, and the creature designs look really good. Chris Tucker was decent at first, but then he turned into a whiny drama queen which there were some chuckles from him, but it was really annoying and embarrassing at times. There are some stereotypes that seems to be a bit racist at times. The action is really good, and the writing is not bad, although really silly at times which they make it as a funny moment, but juts seems to be awkward. The chemistry between Bruce Willis and Milla Jovovich is pretty sweet, and there are some funny moments in there between them two.

The only weapon capable of stopping this evil is the four classical elements with an additional fifth one that is represented as a supreme and perfect being named Leelo thus a quest begins where a taxicab named Korben Dallas needs to fulfill Leelo\u00b4s destiny.  \nIf you ask a number of people their opinion regarding \"The Fifth Element\" you will either get two answers: \"I love it\" or \"I hate it\", so I will try to explain why this film is known for polarizing both audiences and critics. \"The Fifth Element\" is a filmed that guarantees a fun time thanks to its fun to watch acting with the highlight being the masterful Gary Oldman in a role so silly that he seems to be having the time of his life, creative visuals, laughable dialog, hilarious setups, a irreverent directing, memorable moments, a straightforward narrative, a ridiculously goofy but fun art design, and a tricky camp factor that's executed with efficiency. But this film also counts with numerous elements that audiences will most find annoying: Chris Tucker\u00b4s character is one of the most annoying characters ever put to film, the story is filled with clich\u00e9s, at times director Luc Besson crosses the line between camp and ridicule, the action scenes are laughable, and not in a good way; the running gags quickly got old, and more than a handful of scenes are stretch without any purpose whatsoever.\n\"The Fifth Element\" is a memorable and unique film that is definitely not for everybody but if you enjoy comedies and just want to have a nice time, this is a film made for your demands but if you are a person that demands quality and high level filmmaking you should skip this film.",

The movie is visually inventive, imagining a metropolis that is plausible within the next century consisting of great imaginative elements. The movie is laced with slapstick and humor takes up a great deal of the film to the point it makes the plot look preposterous and the characters goofy diluting the seemingly deep theme.\n\nThe story cannot be more epic in nature, science fiction going apocalyptic with a messiah figure who can save the world and also happens to be a badass fighter as well as someone who needs the love of Bruce Willis to do her job. The plot goes chaotic because of lack of communication and co-ordination on both sides of the spectrum-- which results in the goofiness of the plot and adds humor.\n\nThe characters lose their seriousness simultaneously as the plot beguns to spin out of control. Bruce Willis is the action hero who pulls off dangerous stunts and causes havoc with his firepower and fools with enemies with his quick wit-- the typical Bruce Willis typecast. Gary Oldman is a ridiculous villain who has a very sinister look but has a horrible group of henchmen and eventually has to do everything himself. And the most outlandish character ever played--Chris Tucker as a cross dressing talk show host who is no more than a comic relief and a bit of annoyance, nevertheless the character is a very memorable one for his quirkiness. \n\nThe visual imagination of the film has to be praised for they have created a future that is plausible, especially that of the gigantic metropolis and its mobile hotels and flying cars..a vision reminiscent  Gilliam had conceived in Brazil. Overcrowded apartments and a layer of smog that cover s the foundation of every single megastructure, seems like the inevitable future that the present day earth is heading towards. The aliens are Stars Wars like with bizarre creatures with orc lke figures and fly masks, blue tubular beings..seeming unsettling and humorous at the same time.\n\nThe fifth element is an action/sci-fi flick but whit a plot that consummates with the climax but an initial scope of an interstellar franchise, that was way beyond Besson's imaginative realm. It cannot be taken seriously ever instead as a tribute to the sci fi genre and the excitement it offers us and as a lesson of how it can be convoluted into a goofy story that we are happy to get along for the ride.",

I highly recommend. [revised] This movie is bright, vibrant, and just simply amazing. Brion James is someone I always liked ever since a young boy after seeing Tango and Cash and I was sad to hear of his passing after seeing this film. This movie also taught me who Ian Holm and Gary Oldman were, as I didn't know them by name before this. I can't believe Luke Perry is mentioned in the opening credits and after he trips on a bag is forever forgotten. I do like all the performances of the actors and casting choices. I think whoever did costumes for this film should have been paid more. Costumes are over the top and crazy, but look great in this world. The score of the film is great and I love the soundtrack as well. Music is a driving factor in many scenes and it's done masterfully. Great story, great screenplay, great director, and that's just one guy? This story tells us that even though people are self-murdering, mass destructors, there will always be a savior of some kind to save us from evil so we can kill another day.",

Seeing this film for the second time, I still feel the film contains those qualities but I was able to find more enjoyment in it this time due to my preconceived knowledge of the film and my mind isn't as uptight as it once was back then.\n\nThe film's plot is certainly predictable but I was able to have fun with this due to Luc Besson's light direction, embracing the story's seriousness and pushing some moments to the point where it is actually comes out comedic. Besson does at some points, push the comedy a bit too far and ultimately hurting my feelings towards the film in the process but it wasn't abundant enough for me to feel cold towards it; an example of a poorly handled comedic scene was the one that involves an opera, it leads you on in one direction then suddenly diverts it to another which left me cringing.\n\nBesson was able to sneak in a couple of significant themes, and true they do come off as a bit forced particularly the one found in the film's resolution but I was able to get past that and saw it as an aspect that prevented the film from feeling pointless. Would the film be much better if it turned down its fun and superficial qualities, and letting the film take its content more seriously? Probably, but that wouldn't be what Besson wanted. I think his goal here was to create a film that brings in the films that made an impact on him and have them wrap around a simple story; If one looks carefully, actually one doesn't even try as most of them are quite obvious, but it pokes fun or pays homage to classics like Alien, Star Wars, 2001: A Space Odyssey and Blade Runner, to name a few.\n\nThe film's characters were certainly one of the film's strongest aspects. Some of them may seem ridiculous, like Zorg and Ruby Rhod, but since the film is somewhat conscious of this, it makes it easier to tolerate them. The two leading characters, Korben and Leeloo, are certainly the main reasons why I watch this as the film provides its audience with a tender romance and dialogue that steadily entertains. Though I did hope for some of these characters to show a little more depth but I think that would be asking too much from a film like this.\n\nThe acting in this film was good but far from being astonishing. One can easily see the fun that the cast is having in playing their roles but also providing their roles with enough effort to make their roles feel three dimensional. If I had to nit-pick, I felt Chris Tucker was a tad bit too overwhelming for my tastes, but I only feel this in a few of his scenes as for the most part, he was able to deliver some laughs from me.\n\nThe Fifth Element is certainly not Luc Besson's best but it his most superficially entertaining film. Its sole purpose is to have its audience escape from reality and just have a good time, so if you are looking for some with a bit of substance then look away as this would be a horrible choice.

Jovovich gives a startlingly brave performance as Leeloo, Willis is the perfect gruff everyman, and Oldman gives exactly the kind of weird scenery-chewing performance you'd expect from playing an evil southern-accented businessman named Zorg who runs around with a Loony Tunes-sized gun while wearing a plastic dish on his head.\n\nAnd then there's Ruby Rhod, who is simultaneously the greatest and most obnoxious character in the history of cinema.\n\nAn odd thing this one, but I kind of love it.",

            "content": "Luc Besson's last good film as writer/director. \"Leon/The Profession\" was an absolute high point for him as a filmmaker and he followed that film up with this, which is a grand bit of popcorn sci-fi. The story involves a secret society protecting a secret weapon to defend off an impending attach on earth. That's the big story. The film actually follows futuristic cab driver Bruce Willis getting caught up in working with the secret society when Milla Jovovich literally falls into his cab. From there, the film is a breezy stream of action set pieces, including flying car chases, wild shootouts and epic space battles. The film's villain is a scene chewing Gary Oldman as the evil Zorg, who actually never comes fact-to-face with the hero, Willis. What makes this film work so well is that it knows it's a popcorn film and has no pretenses of grandeur (as compared to Star Wars episodes 1, 2, & 3) and that Besson's vision of the future is a rich, living and well thought out place. Besson began writing the script while a teenager and I think it's the amount of time he's thought about this story that led to so many ideas about how this future world works, even if it's just a quick thruway moment like a retractable shower or even the more thought out mythology of the titular fifth element, viewer can really tell Besson has thought about this world quite a lot. Besides Willis, Jovovich and Oldman there's a great supporting cast that includes  Ian Holm, Luke Perry, Brion James, John Neville and Tiny Lister as the biggest President of the United State you've ever seen on film. I've never been a Chris Tucker, so his purposefully annoying character came off as more grating than funny and was a real drag on the last act of the film for me. Other than that, I quite like this film, though it's still nowhere as great at \"The Professional.\"",

Throw in a bunch of weird and just plain stupid moments such as blue chicks singing opera for twenty minutes and Gary Oldman delivering terrible dialogue in his worst performance ever and you have a true stink-pile. The film also has the single most annoying character ever: Ruby Rhod, played by Chris Tucker. The fact that Bruce Willis actually tried in this role and gave a great action hero performance just annoys me more because it goes to waste when the film is this awful. Do yourself a favor and avoid it.",

            "content": "The Fifth Element is a fully enjoyable, lighthearted and fast-paced Sci-fi adventure which has borrowed stylistic and visual elements from other classic science fiction productions such as Blade Runner and Star Trek. To very shortly sum up the odd story of the film, it depicts a future society where former special-ops major, Korben Dallas played by Bruce Willis is working as a taxi-driver after resigning from the military. A destructive entity is threatening earth and impending doom seems unavoidable, but the event have been foreseen by priests and an alien race called  Mondoshawans and these aliens have created a weapon against the destructive entity in the form of a supreme being called the fifth element. As the result of a series of incidental events the fifth element also known a Leeloo played by Milla Jovovich happens to find herself in Korbens cab and sooner than he knows, Korben becomes involved in a mission to save all of mankind. \r\n\r\nI generally tend to dislike campy movies, but i can't really say if this particular film would be better if it took a more serious tone or if the goofiness is such a big part of the films entertainment value that it would suffer without it. The casting is more or less optimal, Bruce Willis is as great as always playing the every day action hero and Milla Jovovich pulls of a very difficult role as the supreme being Leeloo, Gary Oldman gives a very strange performance which fits well with the film and Ian Holm plays a future priest and last of we have Chris Tucker who plays a future radio DJ, a role which is partially an annoying stereotype that takes up too much space in the film, but equally much a source of humor. This isn't the usual type of Science-fiction and it doesn't focus that much on modern issues nor does it get political, but on a few occasions the director takes some satirical strikes at commercialism and the film makes some very interesting points concerning the nature of humanity and our inability to view ourselves objectively.",

The Fifth Element does none of that opting to be a simple and very odd film that entertains from beginning to end.\r\n\r\nThe Fifth Element is about a cab driver unwittingly becoming the central figure in the search for a legendary cosmic weapon to keep Evil and Mr. Zorg at bay. The plot is undoubtedly simple on all corners. It contains the basic good vs. evil scenario in its background with the adventure to obtain mystical objects to save the Earth from a large threat in the foreground. It doesn't do anything new with it basic formula nor is it filled with surprises, but contains interesting ideas and characters. The characters are all vibrant even the villain himself is appropriately comedic. The comedy on the other hand can drag the film. Forcing some comedic antics to drag on a joke longer than it needs to with these overlong segment stretching the run time. It's playful tone makes it an easy viewing. Parodying the the conventions and convoluted nature of the genre it fondly does so with respect. It is itself convoluted too, but it's brisk pace makes its incoherence possible to look past. What's not possible to overlook is the antagonist motivation which is being paid millions find these crystals to destroy everything in the universe. Idiotic yes it is, but the as a whole it does so with it tongue in cheek nature. \r\n\r\nThe cast of actors is significantly better than the film script. If anyone can play the average joe hero in your action movie few can do it better than Bruce Willis. He firmly places his tongue in his cheek with a sarcastic attitude. Cracking jokes one moment and blowing up aliens the next. Gary Oldman performance is not necessarily bad. He's very hammy in his role, but works with the humor of the film. Milla Jovovich pulled off a difficult role well. It's easy to laugh at Jovovich dialogue and her rather odd childlike behavior. She's still is able to be convincing in her scenes whether it be comedic or dramatic. Ian Holm brings (like most of the cast) good humor with him in his simple role. Chris Tucker on the other hand will gather a mix response. He's very flamboyant and loud coming off as funny for some and annoying for others. Although it doesn't help matters that his character serves the plot no favors. Besson imaginative direction is the best part of the film. His vision of the future is full of bright colors with a right mixture of CG and practical effects. The detailed costumes design while goofy looking adds personality to the strange world.\r\n\r\nThe Fifth Element while not an intelligent or a coherent sci-fi is fun enough to pass the time. The good selection actors and vibrant visuals will win you over even if the plot does not.",

Three centuries later, scientist-holy man Victor Cornelius played by Ian Holm declares that along with the four elemental stones, they must also find the fifth element and combine them all to prevent the Earth from being destroyed otherwise, if  the force of evil presents itself to the stones instead, the evil Zorg played by Gary Oldman will trigger the disaster. In the 23rd century, a huge ball of molten lava and flame is hurtling towards the Earth and the fifth element turns out to be a girl named Leeloo played by Milla Jovovich. Despite her remarkable powers, she needs help as she falls into a taxi owned by Korben Dallas played by Bruce Willis who promises to protect her and help her survive. Now everyone had mixed opinions after watching this film but for me, I thought this movie was somewhat good. Bruce Willis has taken a dramatic step forward with his career back then. This science-fiction opera-style film is one primary example on how to make a futuristic movie. Gary Oldman was a good villain and I guess the hairstyle and make-up covers him accurately well. Ian Holm was a great scientist-holy man as he had a great character to work with. This may be crazy but this is actually the first and only time I actually liked Milla Jovovich in this movie. She was a proper 3-Dimensional character and not just a sex object, even if she was hot at times, and I saw her able to act. People often criticized the goofiness of this movie and for me, I know it was goofy at times and that didn't bother me. What bothered me the most and killed the potential full marks from this movie is Chris Tucker as Ruby Rhod! Jesus was he annoying! If you thought Detective James Carter from the Rush Hour movies was obnoxious, then you need a brain scan! Everything was awesome and was a visual spectacle except for him. The Fifth Element gets a 8.7/10.",

People know him for having this charisma that draws people toward one of his movies and he even has the rare quality of being able to create an enjoyable movie just from his presence in it. These characteristics stem from a long filmography of some of the most beloved films of all time (Die Hard, The Sixth Sense) and I think that this movie is one of the main reasons of why he has been so loved.\nThis is a fun movie. That's it, it's a fun movie and I highly recommend anyone check it out. Don't expect it to challenge your mind, but still expect it to entertain and have fun doing it. It's also a really over the top movie which is a make or break for some people. In my opinion, I don't mind an over the top film (Nicolas Cage is my favorite actor). So beware of the bizarre events and characters that are in this movie, everyone is brought up to a ten on the acting scale in this, especially Gary Oldman and Milla Jovovich.  But that all adds to the fun. I actually thought that Gary Oldman did the best job in this movie. \nThe effects were also very impressive for the time period and so were the action sequences. I think most of the effects were practical but the actually CG and stuff looked pretty good, being from 1997. But the practical effects were great. The costumes and set pieces were really cool. I really enjoyed that stuff but I also enjoyed the action sequences too. They reminded me a lot of Die Hard. I think that was what they were going for, Die Hard in space and they did it, with style. Near the end of it when Bruce Willis and the radio DJ (who was the most over the top for sure) were killing the aliens in the cruise ship was especially exciting. I loved it!\nI was pleasantly surprised with this movie. The effects were very good, and the acting was actually  pretty good (for sure enjoyable). I'm just a big fan of movies like like this. Ones that are so gleefully over the top and can laugh at themselves when they need to, and you can laugh at it too. It never does take itself that seriously and it really brings something to it that a lot of films don't, entertainment. I could totally see this movie being that Star Wars rip-off that just gets lost with time, but it's not and this is a pretty infamous movie. It doesn't try to be interestingly directed or daringly artistic, it just goes to entertain, and it entertains the hell out of you.",

Director Luc Besson has created one of the most visually impressive and original worlds in science fiction, one that presents a future less about technological dazzle and more about our present Western society's silly and pervasive attitudes and customs (metropolitan areas are so congested, taxi cabs must now fly; there are still McDonald's restaurants in the 23rd Century etc....) Costumes, designed by legendary French couturier Jean Paul Gaultier, are the most liberal, eye-popping garments I've ever seen in film and this accentuates the film's sassy, and sometimes provocative, tone.",

Featuring Bruce Willis, Milla Jovovich, Gary Oldman, Ian Holm, and Chris Tucker, the cast is quite strong.  Willis and Jovovich in particular bring a lot of charisma to the film and deliver fantastic performances.  Additionally, the visual aesthetics and set designs are amazing, creating an imaginative and vibrant universe.  The humor and satire of the film also work especially well.  The Fifth Element is a fun and lighthearted film that's tremendously entertaining.",

The story of the fifth element is definatley an adventure. Mila Jovovich plays the fifth element and it is surprising as a main element is a woman. I guess this world really cannot survive with them. Gary Oldman playing the villian does a well done job. He keeps a straight face and is determined to get what he wants. Chris Tucker is hilarious when he plays a talk show host. His hair, makeup and wardrobe is  so funny. When all the guns are going off, all he seems to be doing is screaming and in a serious panic mode. Lastly Bruce Willis as the cab driver that saves the world. Truely a story about the little man who can become the hero and save the world.",

Still, it's fun in the disposable way a cartoon is, featuring what have got to be among the goofiest costumes and aliens in any non-parody sci-fi film of the '90s, while the chases seem inspired by The Blues Brothers in the air as opposed to any visionary sense of flying cars of the future.",

            "content": "Being one of the most succesful films in the careers of Bruce Willis and Luc Besson, The Fifth Element sounded like a gleefully fun science fiction film.\n\nThe intro scene to The Fifth Element does not set it up as being an original film. Borrowing elements from Star Wars, Stargate and Star Trek: The Motion Picture, the feature begins as a trifector of derivative elements from Star-themed science fiction titles. After seeming like it is going to take itself too seriously, the film quickly changes and embraces its cinema du look roots. The sudden shift is somewhat jarring, but the moment that Bruce Willis enters the screen encapsulates the exact point in time that the comic energy overtakes the material. But that isn't the only time it happens. There is never a sense of consistency in the mood of The Fifth Element because it can't decide whether it wants to be a legitimate science fiction feature or a parody of one. This ultimately creates a sense of imbalance in the film.\nThe scale of the film is also inconsistent. The story takes place in a limited series of settings with occasional larger scale shot depicting spaceships at war or flying car chases, but I honestly don't feel that I believe the wider universe of the narrative to be convincing. This is largely because there is little transition between locations with the speedy narrative simply cutting from one place to another without spending enough time in one. And since the film has the potential to have big scale locations capitalized on, the fact that it fails to do so more often ultimately ends up frustrating. But I will admit that even though I didn't full believe it, I did find joy in the visual experience. Luc Besson's vision of a science fiction future is packed with all kinds of flash. Sticking with the conventions of the cinema du look movement, The Fifth Element maintains a gritty story context and a sense of flashy colour to combat it. The society is seen as very damaged yet covered up by the facade of colour, and it provides an interesting experience. There are all kinds of awesome technological concepts and designs put into the film which use strong practical effects. But also, there are some awesome moments such as the flying taxi chase or space battle scenes that put the quality of the visual effects to maximum use. The detailed animation in these moments is very impressive and the colour is just marvellous, but at the same time the film is not ovverreliant on them and instead moderates them with use of practical effects and colourful scenery to fuel the experience.  But one thing that stood out for me was that the design of the Mondoshawans is just plain weird. Though the story characterizes them as being the species that guards the ultimate weapon for Earth, they look like gigantic chickens in robot suits who walk like sumo wrestlers. They clearly represent the more dramatic aspects of the film but are hard to take seriously, and even though they are only present for a brief period of screen time they interfere with the credibility of the experience.\nStill, the ultimate flaw of The Fifth Element lies in the fact that Luc Besson doesn't divert his large budget to the right cause. With $90 million to helm, Luc Besson is so bent on showing off all these ideas for a future that he forgets to put enough action into the film. The action scenes in The Fifth Element make strong use of the film's production elements which are all captured with strong cinematography and timely editing, but that just makes it all the more frustrating when there is not enough of them. The same can be said about the big budget CGI scenes, but budgetary limitations can explain that. They cannot explain the lack of more action choreography though, and the fact that the cast clearly have a fun time engaging in warfare simply makes the film less satisfactory when the action is lacking in quantity. That is the ultimate drag for the experience, and it means that there is ultimately not enough to distract from the tonal inconsistencies and cheesy screenplay.\nThe one thing that did make a strong impression for me in The Fifth Element was the cast.\nSince Bruce Willis started out his career working largely in comedy on the series Moonlighting before hitting it big as an action star in Die Hard. In The Fifth Element, he is given the role of Korben Dallas where he has to amalgamate these skills into a singular character. As a result, he delivers one of his best performances in years. Though his over the top energy is more restrained than the surrounding cast, this proves ideal because it lets him succeed as a legitimate action hero and a cheesy adventure man at the same time. He proves to capture Luc Besson's character with a strong combination between his instinctive masculine charisma and a touch of camp energy, standing out as one of the best parts of the film.\nMill Jovovich also makes a decent effort. It's easy to see how one might be polarized by the performance of Milla Jovovich. She is constantly lost in her own world, speaking a language she actually invented for the film. But considering her characters is actually a humanoid reconstruction of the titular fifth element there is genuinely little materal to work with. Fortunately enough, she manages to capture an alien-type figure who balances both frailty with fierce strength. Milla Jovovich is able to convey both the childish innocence of a new creation and the wisdom of a fast learner at the same time, and her dedication to staying in character remains a boost for her credibility.\nGary Oldman is awesome as always. Even though he has to shave half his head, comb over the other half and use a southern accent all for his character, Gary Oldman is the kind of actor who can pull anything off. So when he re-teams with Luc Besson to create another villain after Leaon: The Professional, it is no surprise that he pulls it off. Gary Oldman sinks his tenacious teeth into the ridiculous flamboyance of the role and captures a hilarious contrast between the way his character looks and acts. His surface level appeal is hilarious, as is the novelty that it is actually Gary Oldman in the role, and yet the actor still manages to successfully work a legitimate effort into the part.\nChris Tucker does not have the same level of appeal though. Chris Tucker transcends the level of flamboyance delivered by everyone else in the cast, for better and for worse. While his abundance of campy energy delivers sporadic laughs, it is so unstoppable that it proves overwhelming. Chris Tucker's insistence on shouting every line manages to create a convincing character, but not so much an entertaining one. He doesn't have the slightest bit of subtlty about him as he loudly and repeatedly shoots every character with one line after the other but failing to come up with any reason why it matters. Chris Tucker is in heavy excess in The Fifth Element, and it's the first time I've ever seen him as annoying.\n\nSo The Fifth Element has a talented cast and plenty of colourful gusto, but its overblown visual style is dragged down by a lack of action and a jarring sense of tonal inconsistency",
