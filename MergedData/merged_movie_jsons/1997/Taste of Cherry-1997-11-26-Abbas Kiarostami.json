            "content": "The film follows the ways of Mr Badii on what is probably the last day of his life. We can see him drive around in his jeep, in a wasteland near Tehran. He stops from time to time, in order to ask people if they would like to do a little job for him. But even the money he eagerly offers does not help him to inspire their confidence: People are on their guards against this queer middle-aged man, who is obviously just looking for a homosexual pick-up.It takes a whole while until he finally reveals his secret: He is determined to commit suicide and has already dug a hole in the earth where he wants his body to be buried. The only thing that worries him now is that he needs somebody to fill up his grave.Now that we know what he is after our interest must inevitably concentrate on the reasons for his death wish. But, strangely enough, none explanation whatsoever is  offered.Such a contravention of audience expectation has led to a massive rejection of the movie. Even renowned critics like Roger Ebert find it \"excruciatingly boring\" and rather helplessly ask themselves whether it wouldn't help to know more about Badii.But doesn't the mere fact that, for most of the movie's running time, we just see a \"car driving in the wasteland\" give us a clue about its signification and therefore the answer we are looking for?This wasteland is a barren landscape, its dusty vastness inspires nothing but sadness. Its dryness is the opposite of life; fertility seems impossible in such an arid and joyless desert. It is therefore the ideal background for any suicide attempt.As we do not get any psychological information about Badii and the reasons for his death wish are not revealed, we must look for other means of expression. The significance of a true work of art is not necessarily to be found in explicit words. If the main character does not speak we therefore must have a closer look at the landscape that surrounds him in order to find a hidden meaning.In the first part of the jeep's journey we can only notice its utter desolation. Then, when Badii has finally found a man that seems to be willing to cooperate, a surprising change takes place: Green trees and bushes emerge and, along with the now audible twittering of birds, give sign of life. At the same time the man in the car, who only accepted Badii's offer because of economic reasons, sings life's praises in order to make Badii discover not only \"the taste of cherries\" but also renounce his suicide plan.The portrayal of landscape seems to reflect the inner state of the characters: the desolate hopelessness of a suicide candidate is followed by an uncompromisingly positive attitude to life. And, significantly, this replacement is actually provoked by the picked-up man, as it was him who told Badii to take the detour.The same contrast is also present in the penultimate scene. We see Badii lying down in his grave, and then the screen is invaded by complete darkness. This must definitely be the end, we feel, Badii's death wish after all has triumphed. But once again Kiarostami wondrously succeeds in surprising us. We hear the noise of rain, it is flooding down upon the dry wasteland. And although the movie in the end does not offer a clear answer, there is at least a ray of hope: This rain may come just in time to instil new life into a dried up human soul.",

            "content": "The man is driving his Range Rover across the deserted wasteland near Teheran but if it wasn't for the sights of a few veiled women, the setting could belong to any random impoverished Islamic country in the Middle-East. Not to deprive the film from its cultural texture but it's important to know this is not a political comment of any sort but a character study.... of the most puzzling kind, raising more questions than it provides answers, leaving us viewers the privilege or the burden to figure out what happens next.\"The Taste of Cherry\" is a metaphor for the sweet taste of life only someone at the edge of death can truly appreciate, like a beautiful sunset, a colorful sunrise, the sight of children playing and smiling, a comforting thought, any sign of kindness... which the film is stingy of, deliberately, until its final act. Abbas Kiarostami doesn't paint the canvas of a happy nation because its focus is the sad face of a man named Mr. Badil, selfishly resigned to commit suicide and looking for someone to bury his corpse after he finds him dead in a pre-digged hole. Everything's planned except for that last formality.To use a hackneyed expression, the destination here doesn't matter, only the car journey of a man trying to pick up a helper to fulfill his last wish. Over the course of this sad odyssey, he'll meet a young and shy soldier from Kurdistan, an Afghani seminarian and an aged taxidermist, the young man feels entrapped in a situation whose awkwardness go beyond the realm of ordinary problems he's used to live. The second embodies the religious side of the story and expectedly reminds Badil that suicide is taboo in religion and wouldn't make himself an accomplice, his tone is not preachy but rather amiable and friendly.But Badil is a stubborn man, and for each argument finds a verbal counterattack, a job is a job, why would a poor man refuse the opportunity of a six-month wage for burying a corpse. Why would God punish someone whose unhappiness will only cause more harm to the beloved ones? Still, the tone changes and Badil gets more eloquent until he finds the wise old man who embodies our own vision: life is just too precious and valuable, he evokes what makes things worth to live, he tells a joke, he sings but finally agrees to do the job, hoping that Badil will do the right choice and choose not to kill himself.Let's get back to Badil and more importantly, the car, which is inseparable from the story, as both a means to a morbid end and its paradoxical obstacle. The car is his life, it represents the only zone of comfort left in his supposedly meaningless life, through the windshield, he offers us a glimpse of a seldom seen Iran, not too religious, struck by employment, full of life and can only offer his Range Rover as a sign of his wealth, completely oblivious to the social realities of his own country. Badil doesn't even realize that his invitations sound like sexual pick-ups in a country where homosexuality is more taboo than suicide. He never finds the proper words to get to the point, maybe too focused on the road, to be able to empathize with his passengers' point of view. The car is his life, the road is his death.But we're embarked as passengers in the car of life and from the regular external shots of the car driving through the deserted area, we see that the man is circling around the same road, and understand how truly lost he is. Badil the man in the car is hard to like and it's only after he meets the old man that he wises up a little, leaves the car and seems to have clear directions. Before, he joined a guardian up his little tower and enjoyed the sight while the guardian deemed it as dust and earth. For once, it's Badil who sees the half-full glass, all good things come from dust and earth, the guardian says everything gets back to dust. Outside the car, Badil can taste a few things, if not cherries, in the car, he doesn't even acknowledge the help of the workers who gave him a lift when one wheel fell near a ravine.Kiarostami plunges us in the mind of someone who doesn't know where to go, it's not much a study on Badil but on the state of mind of suicidal persons. The film demands some patience and I'm not sure the ending rewards it but I guess it conveys the same sense of nothingness inherent to the lost soul. The ending is rather brave in the way it polarizes viewers but as someone who went through the same questioning, I know suicide is no kidding matter and I could feel the pain of Homayoun Ershadi, his desperation, his anger, his sadness, and after the man accepted to do the job, the realization that it was up to him now.Whether he succeeded or not belongs to another movie and I'm not sure I would have loved a clear ending, in a way a satisfying study ends when the arc is fully closed, but the real focus isn't the driver, or the car, but the road. I know road movies can be wonderfully existential so this is a film that gets the perfect setting and road to contain these states of mind.I used the word \"existential dead end\" for movies like \"Magnolia\" and \"The Diving Bell and the Butterfly\", the expression can apply for Badil's road. The whole irony is that as long as we can pick up passengers, no road will lead to a dead end.Simple but not simplistic, complex but not complicated, straightforward in a circular way, the 1997 Golden Palm Winner is a special movie, not easy to watch but fascinating to contemplate.",

            "content": "Quiet and unassuming, Abbas Kiarostami's meditation on connection and charity has a lulling rhythm that becomes so hypnotic that any sudden movement--and there's only one--jolts you almost as much as a fright in a horror film. Kiarostami uses a simple cinematic style consisting of real-time long takes and basic cutting between two characters (the only conversations are between two people at a time) but his camera always seems to be in the exact place it needs to be, capturing both the close-up nuances of the actors and their smallness against the Iranian landscape. (Many of the exterior shots are of a lone Range Rover driving on the outskirts of an unnamed city.) The elegant story concerns a man (Mr. Badii, played with a haunting lyricism by Homayon Ershadi) wishing to commit suicide and trying to find someone who will assist him by arriving the next day to see if he is alive or dead. He selects only men he determines to be in a state of financial crisis and who are dedicated to their families or their religion and to whom payment will bring relief. Each man rejects the notion of suicide, representing, in turn, fear of the unknown, religious and moral conviction, and faith in the goodness of life; and although Mr. Badii gives no reason for his desire to die, irregardless of his unhappiness it's clear he wishes to return to the earth which has borne humankind. Kiarostami refuses to pass judgment against his gentle characters' decisions, giving each person respect and dignity even when they're unable to put their convictions into meaningful words: they're good men asked to assume an enormous responsibility they do not understand. The film concludes with subtle, beautiful ambiguity (we never learn Mr. Badii's fate and the coda is an odd excerpt of the filmmakers at work) and its power is a result of the reflection that comes afterward. A unique experience, not to be missed.",

            "content": "Kiarostami strikes again with another provocative film, very much in the same vein as his others: drawn out films that involve a very introspective soul-searching of all of the character's involved, and in so doing, finding some more meaning to the idea of what life is all about.From the beginning to the end, Kiarostami gives us a complex script of characters that we come into contact with, and as we learn about each one, we learn more about the idea of life. What makes the film very interesting for a Western viewer is that I find closer to Kiarostami's Iran after each of his films that I watch, and become more informed to it. We learn intimate details about the lives of several Iranians.Throughout the film I found that, although like many of his films it was quite slow-paced, it contained the extraordinarily rich dialog that is expected of a Kiarostami film. His films advance through their rich dialog while using the dusty Iranian landscape as their backdrop. I found a lot of the cinematography to be terrific, viewing the city from a distance and looking into the dusty foot-hills on the outskirts of Tehran. It is more than poetic to see a man at the end of his rope searching through the dust and faces of Tehran's poor laborers for answers about life and death. In many ways, the film is a large metaphor for the human state of affairs.The film culminates very well, and we all eventually find our own taste of cherry in the film. I always feel as if Kiarostami's films are a very philosophical experience, and are quite personal. In this sense, Kiarostami's films are amongst the best that I have seen.However, they are undoubtedly slower paced than other films, and they require the viewer to detach himself from any western stereotypes that he has about film. This would not be a good film for somebody expecting action or a typical Western film, but rather, this would be a film that I would recommend only to those who are in the mood for an insightful, philosophical film that shows an alternative view of life. Overall, it was an emotionally powerful film that will stick out in my memory as all Kiarostami films do.",

He won't find any by the army, for no manifestation of strength shall be able to solve any problem permanently. Nor will he find help under the wings of religion, based as it is on faith, a principle too abstract to heal concrete suffering. Help will come, instead, from nature, its colors and smells. An old man, who shared the same unhappiness as a youngster, shall show the aspirant has-been that nothing deserves such an extreme decision: even the sight of a happy couple crossing the road can change your attitude towards life. Shot on the bare but wonderfully colored hills of Iran, which often recur in Kiarostami's environments, I felt dizzy looking at the scene where the protagonist tries to foresee his underlife by projecting his shadow under a fall of sand and stones unloaded from a camion: this scene alone is worth the Oscar!",

            "content": "3 drastically different stories unfold from the same scenario, kind of like Rashomon. It takes until towards the conclusion of 1st \"story\" for us to know what Mr. Badii's intent is, and when we find out he wants help from somebody to bury him the dialogue becomes very deep and thoughtful.There are plenty of good lines in this film, such as \"you cannot use the spade, but you can use the gun,\" questioning the difference between two methods of going about killing somebody. There is definitely more of a cowardice behind the use of a gun, and the soldier embodies this by fleeing the car before answering if he will help Mr. Badii.The film has a brilliant structure, making it seem like three stages of life. We have the young soldier, representing that we fear death in youth. Then we have a slightly older man who has a religious background who explains the problem with suicide. This represents an awareness of death, but the man trying to convince Badii that suicide is a sin shows not necessarily coming to terms with death just yet.The final conversation is the longest, and it revolves around an older taxidermist. Not only is he closer to death than Badii, he is familiar with death since he is a taxidermist. He is also extremely wise and has a lot to say about why Badii should reconsider, but he also accepts the job, showing an acceptance of death. It is also important to note that the film takes place over one long day, and with night coming at the end of this day it represents the ending of life in a sense.This is a really brilliant movie with such a strange ending that I still do not quite understand. I would have liked if the film had ended when they day ended rather than the ending that reflects on filmmaking. In my opinion, this is a near-perfect film.",

I was pleasantly surprised by A TASTE OFCHERRY.  It's a linear narrative, and the film's early ambiguityconcerning the driver's quest kept me guessing (I knew nothingabout this film going in, which was a real plus).  The film's unusualvisual style, particularly the long unedited takes, works surprisinglywell for this type of story.

            "review_title": "Where we contemplate suicide from a totally different perspective",
            "content": "Although I've seen many movies from other Iranian and Middle Eastern directors, this is the first I've watched from the late director, Abbas Kiarostami. And like some of those others - Nuri Ceylan from Turkey comes to mind - Kiarostami, in this story, exclusively concentrates on questions about the human condition. Specifically, it's about the self-destructive urge by one man. And it is here that Kiarostami inverts the whole idea of helping those who contemplate suicide.Suicide, in itself, is a ready and obvious turn-off for many viewers, probably. And coupled with the apparent treacle-like pace of the narrative and the repetitive scenes of a lone man, Badii (Homayoun Ershadi), driving in and around hills outside Tehran, this story gives a whole new dimension to the idea of going over the same ground, again and again, to prove a point. And all the while we, as viewer, are inside the auto for most of this movie, up close and very personal....But to avoid seeing this movie would be a big mistake, in my opinion.I say that simply because the idea of suicide has probably occurred to most people, including myself, at some time in their lives. Whether that idea was part of Kiarostami's motivation for making this movie, we will never know, of course. I dare say it occurred to him, though.At the first frame, we're in Baddii's well-worn Range Rover as he drives, his face set, his gaze wandering here and there, searching for a likely assistant for his plan to kill himself. In sequence, he stops a variety of men - a seminarian, a young soldier, a security guard; each man and Badii converse about his need to have somebody help him to suicide, Badii describing what a helper must do. Each time, Baddi has no success until, with a blindingly quick jump-cut, an old man, Bagheri (Abdolrahman Bagheri) is in the car, a helper who finally agrees to abide by Badii's wishes.So, after taking Bagheri to close where he lives, Badii drives off, content that he has secured a deal; rapidly, however, he drives back in a fluster, as doubts creep into his mind. Frantically, he walks around the area until he finds the old man Bagheri to seek further assurance he will indeed help Badii next morning. Somewhat annoyed, the old man again gives his solemn promise. And stalks off.Slowly then, Badii returns to his home/apartment, makes his final preparations, makes a point of turning off all the lights as he leaves, locks the door, leaves his car, and then takes a taxi back to the cherry tree, he had previously selected, at which he will terminate his life during the night, and as thunderstorms - a much-overused trope perhaps - begin.It is there, then, that I will leave you to find out why Bagheri decided to help, and about Badii's fate that night. And about an absolutely unexpected ending.It's a bleak story, but one that is played out in too many ways by thousands every day, more or less in every country on the planet, probably. Perhaps then, Kiarostami is urging us to think upon that more often as we all traverse our own daily ups and downs - and especially in relation to those who are nearest. Once seen, this is not a movie to forget.Recommended for all, except toddlers obviously. Give it eight out of ten.",

            "review_title": "Let's try this a second time (scroll down for my first review if you so wish)",
            "content": "SPOILERS (starting second paragraph), but I think you should read it anyway. I've wrestled with this film since the moment I saw it three days ago now. Initially, I thought it was a very artful and well made film that flopped at the end (and not, mind you, at the infamous final scene, but a bit earlier). I liked a lot of it, but was frustrated and downright angry over a good bit of it, as well. I broke down and read the review of my arch nemesis, Jonathan Rosenbaum. I actually liked what he said quite a bit, to my surprise. Although he couldn't convince me that A Taste of Cherry was good, he did a lot to interpret the film, especially its odd final sequence. But even though Rosenbaum's review originally raised my appreciation for the film, the more I thought about it the more it shrank in stature.Taste of Cherry is a sort of a humanist allegory. Mr. Badii is unhappy and wants to end his life. We never know why, because Kiarostami wants him to stand for anybody. The audience is supposed to see themselves in the role. Mr. Badii drives around a landscape, barren of everything but some bits of construction equipment. He is looking for someone to bury him after he commits suicide by overdosing on sleeping pills. First he picks up a young soldier, who is frightened at the proposal and ends up fleeing from his Range Rover. His second passenger is a seminary student who reminds him that the Koran preaches against suicide. Badii is unconvinced. \"Is it not a sin to be unhappy?\" he queries (I don't think it is in any religion that I know of, but we'll leave that alone).Up to this point, I thought it was a very good movie. Then a third passenger enters the film. He agrees to do it because he desperately needs the large amount of money Badii is offering. But as he is driven to his workplace, the man desperately tries to convince Badii that life is worth living. He tells a story: in 1960 he, too, decided that life was not worth living and tried to take his life after a big argument with his wife. He was going to hang himself from a mulberry tree. But, after he tastes one of the mulberries, he decides that life is too sweet to end it like that. If you die, Mr. Badii, you will never taste cherries again. How can you go through with it? For me, the film's potential greatness died at that sentiment. \"Cliche!\" I shouted. Well, the more I think about it, the more the word \"cliche\" doesn't fit. Of course, I was reminded of the Chinese parable of the man who was chased by a tiger. He escapes by climbing down a steep cliff. But on the ground below there is another tiger, so he's screwed either way. But on the cliff he finds some wild strawberries, and they turn out to be the sweetest he's ever tasted. You see, it's not quite the same thing. So the word I was looking for, the one I should have shouted, was not \"Cliche!\" but \"Trite!\"Kiarostami isn't so shameless that he has Mr. Badii immediately decide not to kill himself. In fact, we never really find out if he does or not. However, after listening to his third passenger, we see sparks of the will to live appear in Badii's manner. If not the will to live, the notion that existence is beautiful. Even if Badii dies, he dies with the thought that the world contains much beauty. This is too easy. I mean, it's very easy to depict a character whose problems are deliberately left unspoken and then give him this kind of revelation. If this film brightens your day, fine, but realize what it's saying and how morally simplistic it all is. You might prefer Taste of Cherry to It's a Wonderful Life, which has more or less the same message, but that says more about you than it does either of those films. One of the biggest reasons that Taste of Cherry fails is that it is so figurative. It asks us not to identify with a character, but with, I guess, ourselves. It's a Wonderful Life depicts a man who sees that life is worth living because of all of the character's accomplishments. We can see ourselves in George Bailey, but he himself is, without a doubt, a fleshed-out character. We understand exactly why George Bailey's life is wonderful.But life is not wonderful for everybody. Troubles have a scale, and sometimes nonexistance looks like it might be a whole lot sweeter than the taste of cherries. Take Leaving Las Vegas, for instance (perhaps renamed Taste of Liquor?). Unlike Taste of Cherry, this film - and it's American, Lord help us - pulls not a punch. We have only the vaguest idea why Ben Sanderson has decided to commit suicide, but we know he's decided and he's not turning back. Leaving Las Vegas is about an individual. He actually finds what might be happiness, but he knows it's as fleeting as anything else in his world.  The film isn't an allegory, so it doesn't presume to tell us how to feel. I'd also point to Louis Malle's masterpiece The Fire Within. The main character in that film, Alain Leroy, having decided on suicide, visits all of his friends one last time. The more he talks to them, the more he is convinced that he is right in his decision. Again, the film is about an individual and is not interested in sentimentality. It's an argument for suicide. What it depicts is an individual's choice. It is not interested in the kind of sentimentality of Abbas Kiarostami. Both The Fire Within and Leaving Las Vegas realize that it will take a whole hell of a lot more than a bowl of tasty fruit to make life worth living. What Taste of Cherry represents is cheap, esoteric art movie sentiment. 5/10.",

The state can't help Mr. Badii, the church can't help him...and even though nature, in the form of Mr. Bagheri, tries, we do not know if it succeeds. Absolutely fascinating.  It shows that a director doesn't need $200,000,000 and a raft of special effects and explosions to make a good film.As for the shot-on-video ending, it's entirely possible that it's there to appease the Iranian censors.  \"Look!  Here's Mr. Badii!  Alive and well. It's just a movie!\"  Another subtle commentary on the state of affairs in Iran today, I'll wager.  At least, that's how I chose to see it.It seems to me that the title reflects Douglas Adams' techniques for flying--fall, and then distract yourself so that you don't hit the ground. It's not that the taste of cherry makes life worth living, per se, it's that simple things can distract you from your cares.This movie was well-shot, well-directed, well-acted, and well-written.

            "content": "*************SPOILERS AHEAD**************This movie reminded somewhat of Jim Jarmusch's \"Night on Earth,\" only the characters in that film were much more interesting.  Don't get me wrong, the characters in \"A Taste of Cherry\" are interesting as well, but the majority of the film takes place within the confines one setting (the interior of an automobile), almost like a stage play.  And if you're gonna have nothing but talking heads throughout, the characters better be so interesting that it'll cause us to transcend the claustrophobia of one setting.  I felt the concept was interesting--a man who's down on his luck searching for someone to kill and bury him.  Sounds like a very difficult task, since whoever does it (if they get caught) will be charged with homicide.  Whether or not it was the victim's consent, murder is murder.  But there were two thoughts that kept running through my head throughout the film.  The first was why did he want to commit suicide in the first place?  We know nothing about this man's backstory, so how are we able to feel sympathy for his anguish and connect with him?  I thought it might've been a gimmick to create tension and cause a gasp in the audience when we finally learn why he wanted to do it.  But that wasn't the case.  The second question was why did he lack the guts to kill himself?  Sure, many people--no matter how serious they are about suicide--would lack the guts to actually run the razor across their wrists or shoot themselves in the head.  It's not uncommon.  But I wanted to know his reason.  Without previous exposition of his character, the audience is left in the dark.  I did not hate the film, because for the most part it held my attention and some of the dialogue (which I later found out was improvised) was quite colorful.  I also liked certain shots--for example, the shot of the sun rising at dawn.  The sun is a bright shade of red, which probably symbolizes the cherry that the old preacher was talking about.  And then the plot twist came.  Some audiences might have a detailed explanation about what it was supposed to mean and symbolize, but I simply felt it was a cop-out.  It was as much a cop-out as showing someone waking up from a dream.  So by the end I was totally baffled, and not in the good way.  And before I conclude I must commend the main actor for his fine performance which was rich in emotion, even during the scenes in which he had no dialogue.  The other performances were good too, but his stood out the most in my mind. \nMy score:  5 (out of 10)",

For what the Iranian film industry has at its disposal, this film is an exceptional achievement!\nThis film is a great example of how the expression of human beings' feelings and ideas cannot be held back by censorship.

            "content": "When discussing Iranian cinema, one generally feels compelled to fall back on a combination of superlative descriptions and trite clich\u00e9s. This is particularly true when evaluating the work of director Abbas Kiarostami, with many critics over-using words like deep, meditative, thoughtful and transcendent. Certainly, those particular platitudes can be labelled at much of Kiarostami's work, particularly Homework (1989), And Life Goes On (1991) and Under the Olive Trees (1994), however, I felt that this film, for me, was really trying too hard to live up to words like tranquil, hypnotic, pensive and so on, but instead, came across more like a film student's attempt to pastiche the style of European art cinema. To me, the film seems a little stilted, and I suppose a label like ostentatious might, just this once, be entirely accurate.The film adopts throughout an almost Bergmanesque stance on the idea of life and death (I see this film as something of a companion piece to Bergman's 1957 film Wild Strawberries) with the central character setting out on an odyssey of self-discover that may, perhaps, lead him to the ultimate in self-destruction. So, in some respects, I suppose the film could be seen as a road movie, albeit, a road-movie in the European tradition; owing more to films like the aforementioned Wild Strawberries and Wim Wenders' Kings of the Road (1976) than something like Thelma and Louise (1991) or Driving Miss Daisy (1988) (although, having said that, I guess you could make a mental link between the allusions of the journey of a life and the idea of life lessons being passed on between driver and passenger to the themes and characteristics of the previously noted Jessica Tandy picture). However, A Taste of Cherry (1997) lacks the vibrancy and the sense of evocation and cultural landscape usual found in European road-films, whilst also fudging the central issue of a character on the road through life to instigate his own death.The film ultimately seems rather slight; refusing to diverge from the central character's point of view as he progresses on his journey. Along the way he ponders the passing landscape and enjoys (or endures, depending on how you look at it) a series of deep, philosophical conversation with the passengers he picks up, which for me, were a little like the conversation scenes in Wild Strawberries, only much more laboured. It is here in these conversational scenes that the life and death aspect of the story intensifies, as our lead protagonist confesses to each passenger that he plans to eventually commit suicide and, the only reason he offered a lift to each respective passenger in the first place, was in the hope that they would tend to his body after the act has been committed. I suppose this is to further the theoretical and philosophical discourse at the heart of the film, although, for me, the weight of Kiarostami's dialog and ideas - coupled with the earnest qualities of the performers and the no-nonsense direction, made the film hard to take and the character hard to identify with. Again, I was reminded of Bergman's great masterpiece, and the journey that his character Isaac Borg takes - culminating with that beautifully enriching final scene that seemed to make the whole film work on an entirely different level - only this time, without the sentiment and sense of emotional involvement.A Taste of Cherry is a very cold and clinical film - seeming more like an intellectual exercise than something we could watch in order to reap something back - with both the prosaic acting style and the minimum of camera angles, editing coverage, etc (the film usually has two single-camera shots of each actor speaking separately - never interacting on screen to further stress the idea of dislocation). Then there's the ending; I'm not going to reveal what happens (thought it has been discussed in much detail on various other websites if you want to have a look around), though, suffice to say, it breaks down every shard of passion and humanity that the film had been struggling to maintain, with Kiarostami feeling the urge to completely deconstruct the film in a way not too dissimilar to what Jodorowski did at the end of The Holy Mountain (1973).As with the majority of Kiarostami's work, A Taste of Cherry seems heavily indebted to the films of Yasujiro Ozu (particularly Tokyo Story and Floating Weeds) with shades of Bergman and also Tarkovsky (I think there might be a distant echo of Nostalgia here); though for me personally, it felt more like a cold and technical imitation of those filmmakers, as opposed to something that could rival them. This is a slow, laboured and difficult film, certain to alienate many viewers through its endless philosophical dialogue, single-camera \"in-car\" set-ups (also employed in Kiarostami's 2002 short-form confessional work, Ten) and overall lack of emotional involvement; though it will certainly be of some interest to other art-house connoisseurs and ardent fans of Kiarostami and his particular style.",

            "content": "Abbas Kiarostami has not only been critically lauded by film critics and theorists, but also by some of the greatest directors, from the late Akira Kurosawa and Atom Egoyan to the legendary 'Film God' Jean-Luc Godard. This is probably of his fresh use of ideas and spiritual/humanism way to directing and writing his films. His work, according to the director himself, is reminiscent of Andrei Tarkovsky (who had made the most spiritual films ever made), Hou Hsiao-Hsien, Theo Angelopoulos and Frederico Fellini (although I would also add directors like, Yasujiro Ozu) who want the audience to let the film live in their minds soons after, letting them fill some details of the story. This technique reminds me both of the short stories of Anton Chekhov and South-Asian Minimalism, such as the 'Palm-Hands Stories' of Yasunari Kawabata (Nobel-Prize laureate), where less is more. His methods of rubbing the line between fiction and nonfiction is an excellent way, a common theme in his films. Taste of Cherry is one of his best films (then again, I have only seen four of them). It is also very demanding, especially the ending, which might be a disappointment (he did made a alternate ending, though, without that video thing at the end, as an experiment in one festival screening). There are many things to notice in this film: (1) The helicopter sounds in the background (some spiritual metaphor?) (2) Earth and Naturalism (there's a lot of earth and dust in this movie, and the far shot of the grave reminded me of a painting by Manet). (3) The acting. The actor remainds almost stone-faced throughout the movie, again showing by concealing. Trivia: The actor, Mr. Badii, was not actually face-to-face with most of his passengers. For the first passenger, the soldier was face-to-face with Kiarostami himself for the whole segment (you never see Mr. Badii and the Soldier in one same shot). In fact, none of the passengers, at the beginning (except probably the taxonomist) knew that he was in a movie. Kiarostami revealed that only to them later (except for the soldier, who actually did ran off). The seminarian actually believed truly that Kiarostami was going to kill himself. Overall, this is an excellent movie. But, it is not the sort one can compare its quality with others (just like one cannot compare the works of David Lynch with others), since it has its own style to it. However, I was confused at one point when the taxonomist said 'Mulberry' instead of 'Cherry', but then again, perhaps he wasn't actually refering to the same thing.",

But like most purely improvised films, there's a rather low ratio of insights to the amount of screen time spent struggling to come up with something interesting.  (Actually, only one of the characters really manages to be interesting at all.)  Likewise, some of the shots of Mr. Badii driving around aimlessly have a certain Antonioniesque hypnotic effect, but most of them look no more interesting than random video you might have shot yourself in the industrial part of town.  There are critics who call this kind of untouched-by-art realism genius, who say that Kiarostami is making us think, reconsider the very nature of cinema, and so on.  To my mind, the message of the film-- the taste of cherry makes life worth living-- is no more or less profound than, say, Woody Allen rattling off a few of the things that make life worth living in Manhattan, or the epiphany the kid in American Beauty gets from a plastic bag.  (Likewise the message that it's all only a movie.  Never woulda guessed.)  And critics who find such a message shallow in a piece of slick entertainment, but deep when it's in a deliberately unentertaining art film, need to reexamine their critical principles, or lighten up a little-- or at least go see again the work of real art Kiarostami alludes to in his title, Wild Strawberries, which has more depth of characterization and emotional richness in any five minutes than this manages to scrounge up in an hour and a half.",

Basically middle aged Iranian man Mr. Badii (Homayoun Ershadi) is driving through Tehran in his car looking for someone to help him, and he is offering a large sum of money for whoever will do the job he is asking, he wants to commit suicide, and he is looking for someone to bury his body after he is dead, in a spot he has already chosen. He picks up random people as prospective candidates, starting with friendly conversation, getting to know more about them, and then eventually one by one he reveals his plan to them, all he needs them to do is cover him with earth in the grave he has dug, their reactions all seem different. The young and shy Kurdish soldier (Afshin Khorshid Bakhtiari) is quickly shocked by the proposal and refusing to do the job runs away from the car, the Afghan seminarist (Mir Hossein Noori) is against a man killing himself for religious reasons and also refuses to do the job, but the third man, an Azeri taxidermist (Abdolrahman Bagheri), does not object. The taxidermist is willing to do the job, because he needs the money to give to his sick child, but he tries to persuade Mr. Badii not to kill himself, because he attempted suicide himself and only stopped after tasting mulberries (this is obviously the meaning behind the title), but he agrees he will cover his body if he finds him in the grave and dead in the morning. That night Mr. Badii leaves his car and walks in the darkness to the grave, a thunderstorm is beginning, but he lies in the hole, and he presumably kills himself, as the film blacks out, and the final shots of the film are behind the scenes camcorder footage of the crew making the film. In the leading role Ershadi gives a compelling performance, it is interesting you do not find out why the character wishes to kill himself, but on the other hand it adds to the intrigue of him trying to find someone willing to put him in the ground after he's done himself in, based on morality and mortality it is a fascinating story and most watchable drama.

Iranian cinema is something I am just starting to explore and surely appreciate, but this film failed to draw me in as say \"Gabbeh,\" \"Dayareh\" or \"Color of Paradise\" did.Of course the lead character, is intentionally enigmatic; opaque to us in terms of why he might seek suicide. The landscape is a harsh, bitter orange, almost as if he were in some form of hell already. For me, never having a connection with this lead character, pushes me towards those he encounters...but they too are distant. Indeed the point of the first two, is their wanting to maintain that distance. Contrast this with the film \"Goodbye, Solo\" (coincidentally by an Iranian-American, or perhaps vice versa), where the depth of the characters, despite a remote lead, was remarkable. But of course that was in English, so perhaps Farsi-speakers would resonate more here with the characters.Certainly the third passenger, was the most fascinating. And the fact that his job is a taxidermist, quite a nice touch. And perhaps more familiarity with the Koran would have helped me in the echoes of the film.Anyways, this film reminds me of stage play (it was not one originally), which works fine for me typically but I think for some viewers that can be a bit of a turn-off. The slow pace is also mentioned, but this pace is nothing compared to Angelopoulos' amazing work, so again that is not what failed for me. I saw this *before* reading Jonathan Rosenbaum's \"Movie Wars\" where he frequently cites this film as one of his all-time favorites.I think this is a great film for film critics, as it is an open film in a way, open to wide-ranging interpretation. Is the filmmaker himself embarking on his own suicide of sorts in making this film in/for Iran? I mentioned the taxidermist, one who preserves the dead in a life-like state, and the other passengers are those who can be seen as people who are chartered with protecting and/or killing other people, but when it comes to a single person, that is more trying.So perhaps there is more open than the grave in this film, regrettably at this point I am a casual casualty. Perhaps watching this with others instead of solo would have helped me, alas I say \"Goodbye\" to this buy hopefully another hello to Kiarostomi.4/10 Thurston Hunger",

It's a movie of such unparalleled tedium that to pronounce its name may drive people to enter a monastic order in search of stimulus. It is like watching paint remain wet.Astonishingly, A Taste of Cherry (as it translates) won the Palm D'Or at Cannes. It was a decision motivated by politics and pseudery that exemplifies the worst Cannes jury decisions. (\"Zut alors. Zis film, it was made in Iran.\" \"Mon dieu, what's it like?\" \"Well, it's quite boring, but it could be the start of a Middle Eastern renaissance.\")Critics have fawned over the film for its simplicity, but the 95 minutes is a vacuum of Proustian proportions and was, for me, substantially less stimulating than watching the back of the head of the man sat in front of me at the cinema. No one can argue that this film is not boring. It's possible to contend that boredom was Abbas Kiarostami's intention, but if you're going to make that argument then you need to justify it. Does the uneventful nature of the film provide a useful backdrop to the subject? Absolutely not.The plot - a parable depicting a man's quest to find someone who will bury him after he commits suicide - moves with glacial speed. Each candidate explains at length the metaphysical problems with being complicit in such an act, but the monologues are no more sophisticated (and a great deal less articulate) than a pub conversation with a clutch of philosophy students. The most depressing thing is the way it is filmed. At the beginning of most of the shots, you see the main character's jeep trundling from one side of the screen to the other. \"Nothing interesting is happening now,\" you think to yourself as the protagonist explains yet again what he wants his passenger to do, \"but perhaps we will reach a dramatic moment at the end of the shot.\" The jeep duly reaches the end of the frame, only for the film to cut to a near-identical shot of the same jeep crossing the same drab and dusty landscape with the same uneventful monologue.Even if you strip away the boredom, there is precious little underneath unless you engage in the most polo-necked type of film criticism. I have read one review that claimed that the protagonist's stone-faced performance was \"showing by concealing\". Another suggested that the failure to explain the character's motivation for killing himself made him an \"everyman\". There is, I suggest, an element of the emperor's new clothes about this.A Taste of Cherry deals with metaphysics, but that does not make it profound. Viewers who can sit through it are open minded, but that does not make them intellectual. Don't go and see this on the say-so of an impressionable pseud. Don't go and see it at all.",

In \"Taste of Cherry\" I have tried to keep a distance between my spectator and the protagonist. I didn't want spectators emotionally involved in this film. In this film, I tell you very little about Mr. Badie, I tell you very little about what his life is about, why he wanted to commit suicide, what his story is I didn't want the spectators get engaged in those aspects of his life. For that purpose I had to keep Mr. Badie away from the audience. So he is a distant actor in a way. First I thought to end the movie at the point when he laid down on his grave but later I changed my mind. I was uncomfortable to end it at that point because I was very concerned, and am always concerned, about my spectators. I do not want to take them hostage. I do not want to take their emotions hostage. It is very easy for a film-maker to control the emotions of spectators but I do not like that. I do not want to see my audience as innocent children whose emotions are easily manipulable.I was afraid that if I ended the movie where Mr. Badie laid down on his grave the spectator would be left with a great deal of sadness. Even though I didn't think the scene was really that sad, I was afraid that it would come out as such. For that reason I decided to have the next episode where we have the camera running as Mr. Badie was walking around. I wanted to remind spectators that this was really a film and that they shouldn't think about this as a reality. They should not become involved emotionally. This is much like some of our grandmothers who told us stories, some with happy and some with sad endings. But they always at the end would have a Persian saying which went like this \"but after all it is just a story! . . . The very last episode reminds me of the continuation of life, that life goes on, and here the audience is confronted with the reality they had hoped that Mr. Badie would be alive and there he is a part of nature and nature still continues and life goes on even without Mr. Badie. And if one could really think about being or not being present in life, or if one thinks about it in terms of the real implication of such presence, one might not in fact engage in committing suicide at all. The person committing suicide might think that s/he is taking revenge from the society, nature, life, powers to be, and so on. But s/he don't realize that after a suicide life still goes on and things stay the way they are. I could interpret this in a different way. If my audience is as creative as I imagine them to be, they can take this in a variety of interpretations and I can sit here and every time make a different interpretation of it, as every time one can creatively reinterpret the reality. \"",

            "content": "\"Ta'm e guilass\" aka \"Taste of Cherry\" is Abbas Kiarostami's metaphysical meditation on life & death, and also one of the finest suicide \"studies\" I've seen in film.We accompany Mr. Badii's (Homayon Ershadi, who'll be seen in the long-awaited \"The Kite Runner\" and the only professional actor of the cast - actually, some of the \"actors\" didn't even know they were in a film!) journey - a middle-aged man who drives around looking for someone to assist his suicide plan. He intends to take all his sleeping pills and lie down in the grave he dug out in the mountains. He will pay someone to check if he's still alive the next morning, and if not - he should be buried. Simple as that.Kiarostami's film is dry, naturalistic and philosophical - typical characteristics (*qualities*) of Iranian cinema. This film is even more serious than most Iranian films, and its open conclusion might be devastating. Winner of the Golden Palm at Cannes '97 (shared with Shohei Imamura's \"The Eel\"), \"Taste of Cherry\" clearly isn't an easy film to watch, but it makes you reflect about life, for everything it's worth - and that's always a valuable experience. Kiarostami doesn't preach, he doesn't give easy answers or try to say what's right or wrong - and that's why his cinematic poem speaks through the heart. 9/10.",

Seriously, I have seen a whole variety of movies from Iran by now, each from different decades as well but I have never seen one that I could call being anything beyond really good.And this movie is being a great one as well. It's great in all of its simplicity. It's a movie that is taking a humble and honest approach to its subject and doesn't ever goes overboard with anything. The story remains small and simplistic at all times and none of the emotions or story developments feel forced.It's also being a small and humble movie with all of its settings and characters. Most of the movie is set at the same location and it only features a handful of characters in it.The movie is being also especially great with its cinematography and storytelling. It rather not shows or tells you certain things, so that the movie almost constantly forces you to use you our mind to make things up and put certain things together. Sometimes the camera isn't even focusing on the person talking, or the person is off screen entirely. It's a special sort of approach that worked out just great for this particular movie.It's also being a quite interesting one with its themes. The movie focuses on a man that wants to commit suicide and is searching for a man to bury him, once the deed is done. This is however a movie set in an Islamic country, in which suicide is considered to be a mortal sin. This, amongst other things, provides the movie with some provocative moments and exchanges of dialog between the man and the different characters he meets on his search. And it luckily is not a movie that tries to have a moral in it or tries to teach you anything about life. It's instead being one that really allows you to make up your own mind about its subject and the themes it handles.Truly one great and provoking movie, that doesn't ever gets pretentious or overdoes certain things.8/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

It is quite good for about two-thirds of its run, then falls into a pit of cliches, then cops out, THEN ends as vilely as imaginable. A man wants to commit suicide for reasons unexplained (a total gimmick, but I can except it). He picks up three strangers, asking them to bury his corpse for a large sum of money.  For a director who is supposed to be so far out of mainstream, his view of morality is offensively common. It's a lot like It's a Wonderful Life, except less honest with the audience. The first man is afraid of the duty, so he simply runs away when the chance arises. The second man is a man of religion, and attempts to explain why suicide is wrong. The third man is the Arabic version of Forrest Gump. He agrees to do it because he needs the money, but when the main character gives him a ride home the third man does his utmost to convince him that life is worth living. He tells how he went to hang himself on a mulberry tree but decided life is worth living because he tastes how sweet the mulberries are. YES YOU READ THAT RIGHT. How cloying can you get? I guess in Iran life is less like a box of chocolates and more like a bowl of fruit. At least the main character doesn't succumb instantly to this man's annoying ploys, but we can see his determination shrinking. Does he do it? We don't know. I guess it's up to us. I don't complain about this, really, but it's a gimmick, as well. After the film fades to black, it comes up again on scenes of the film being made. This does nothing unless you're determined to make it do something. I'm sure one can masturbate some meaning out of this, but that would just be playing into the hands of Kiarostami's chic fans. Look, if you want a film about suicide that really pulls no punches and actually has a modicum of thought to it, see Louis Malle's excellent The Fire Within.As much bad stuff as I can say about it, I do have to admit that the film is stunningly directed and made, if not at all well written. Well, actually, it is fine until that third passenger. The landscapes are beautiful and the setting is used to perfection. The script is so offensive that that can only help so much.

The story will look to be great when you will read a synopsis somewhere (actually it is great) and you will know already that it is going to be slow. The story is about a man searching for someone to bury him after he dies. Well he is going for a suicide. In his search he meets a lot of people. The film depicts his meet with them. What you are going to see are questions about right and wrong.PROS: The film has an intriguing subject. The screenplay however does not have charming twists or anything like that which will keep you on edge of the seat. The car is moving through a path and you hear and think about the dialogs. You have a lot of time in the film itself to watch and think of what the person feels. The film is not made for a commercial audience. It is made for the purpose of explaining some situation. You cannot expect excitement in these films. It takes you through the dilemma of a man while he is trying to find a person to bury him. Another thing to focus on is the different types of people that he meets. There are moments when you will feel that the real reason to make the film is exploring human behavior, his ideas. It's not that you'll get entirely bored but if you are a patient viewer than you will slowly get to the root of the film.CONS: The character of the lead actor was explored from a different angle and it would have been good if we were given an insight in his past life. It is OK that the main focus of the film is to explore human nature but the man is trying to do this thing and his character will look confusing to the audience because they don't know enough about him.VERDICT: \"Commercial viewers should refrain.\"",

            "content": "In Abbas Kiarostami's 1997 film Ta'm-e gilas (Taste of Cherry) one Mr. Badi, a man about whom viewers learn virtually nothing, drives around Tehran looking for someone to do him a favour: that night, he will kill himself in a quarry outside the city, and he wants someone to cast dirt over his body the next morning.The first half of the film is essentially about Mr. Badi's difficulties finding someone to carry out this small task, in spite of the substantial amount of money he's offering. He is initially mistaken as a homosexual cruising for sex, a misunderstanding that Kiarostami even ribaldly encourages Through suggestive dialogue. A seminary student refuses to help him because suicide is a sin. I must say that I was very disappointed by these 40 minutes plus. Shooting so much of the film inside the car as Mr. Badi drives around is a waste of the possibilities of cinema. Furthermore, there is no real rapport between Mr. Badi and the various actors, as it was originally Kiarostami sitting in the passenger seat, and the dialogue of the men Mr. Badi picks up was only dubbed in later. The film does largely rely on amateur actors, as is common in Iranian productions from this era. Mr. Badi is played by the architect Homayoun Ershadi, and though Ershadi eventually established a film career, this was his first role.The film does become stronger in the second half, when Kiarostami starts to move from the dusty and barren quarry to more lively scenery of inhabited Tehran, a clear metaphor for the joy and colour of life that Mr. Badi would be giving up if he went through with his plans. The film starts to be thought-provoking instead of merely awkward, and as a glance at discussion forums will show, the film does offer enough to keep cinephiles talking about it. Unfortunately, the ending that Kiarostami chose for the film (which I won't spoil here) feels to me like a cop-out, not to mention something that is already an old auteur trope by now.If you like the Iranian Second Wave, then you'll probably find it worthwhile to see Ta'm-e gilas at least once. However, in spite of its winning of the Palme d'Or, I do not feel this is an especially great film.",

Many of them regard it as a masterpiece of the anti-Hollywood movie making: it's very slow paced, devoid of any special FX, and people talk like normal people. Being not a fan of the popcorn movie making, I thought I could find a lot in this movie - and by the way, to say that Hollywood never makes any intelligent movies is stretching it way too far... but sure if you appreciate the likes of \"Armageddon\" or \"Independence Day\" well, look elsewhere, because this movie is as far away as it gets from those flicks.However, this movie disappointed me. Sure, it's very long and slow (not in the 2001 A Space Odyssey sort of way, this is literally 2 hours or so of a man driving on the same road while talking to different people), but that didn't bother me all that much. What bothered me was the ending. To be fair, the ending was a complete joke. We witnessed the sad life of a suicidal man that seems to have no hope. We could even feel the pain of the man, and when he met somebody that finally gave him some hope I was looking forward to a great, touching ending. What do we get? The film crew that walks around like nothing happened. We don't get to know what happens to the man, he's just walking around with the cameramen. What? I know some people would say that's some kind of ingenious idea, but to me it's just pathetic. In a movie like this, that builds the tragedy of a man in a slow-paced, psychological sort of way the ending is the most important part. There's no point with that ending, it just miserably devoids the movie of any value.5/10",

            "content": "9/10 ::CONTAINS SPOILERS:: I am writing to address certain criticisms about this film. To start, I feel this is an amazing movie, with exceptional acting and a very interesting and original concept. The characters had a lot of depth and were very interesting; no stereotypes.Let's begin with the misunderstanding of the man's search. He was not looking for someone to kill him. He had already decided he wanted to commit suicide. He was looking for someone to throw dirt on him after he had died: a ritualistic thing and a matter of respect. It is not a plot hole.Secondly, it is not necessary to know the man's past. It is true, Kiarostami did not reveal the man's reason for suicide and, instead began the story with his search for a person to aid him without flashing back. But the point of the story is not to obtain sympathy for his misfortunes and his want of suicide. That would have made for a boring and unoriginal tear-jerker with no artistic integrity as a story. Any sympathy felt in the movie is derived from the character's difficulty in finding someone to help him. Even then, that role was so well acted and expressive that you really did feel bad for him especially since he was \"containing\" his pain after every declination. The focus of this story was more philosophical and psychological and I respect it greatly for that. It isn't necessary to have everything explained to you; I don't know why people want everything explained to them without room for interpretation and why stories must be formulaic to avoid criticism.As for the ending... One must understand that this movie was not made in America or Europe. The morals of that society may be more restrictive of artistic expression. The depiction of the \"behind the scenes\" aspect was not a plot twist but a way of relieving the gravity of the situation in order to make the topic of the film more acceptable. Suicide may not be as acceptable to the Iranian public (or government) as a movie theme when compared to the thematic freedoms we enjoy in America and Europe.Phenomenal film.",

After a few unsuccessful encounters with men who misconstrue his unspoken proposition, he picks up a young Kurdish soldier in need of a lift. Having offered the young recruit a generous sum in return for the work, the boy leaps out of the car and flees across the hillside where Badii has already dug his grave. His second prospective candidate is an Afghan seminarian, who objects on religious grounds, quoting from scripture to dissuade him. The third is an Azeri taxidermist who accepts the offer as he needs the money for his sick child, but nonetheless tries to deter him from carrying out his plan. He confesses that he too once planned to hang himself from a mulberry tree, but upon tasting the mulberries, chose life. As darkness falls over the city, Badii climbs into his grave and closes his eyes, and darkness falls upon us as the clouds open up.Abbas Kiarostami's minimalist meditation on the circle of life is notable for its use of long shots, such as in the closing sequences. The film is punctuated throughout by shots of Badii's car traversing the winding hilly roads, usually while he is conversing with a passenger. The visual distancing stands in contrast to the sound of the dialogue, which always remains in the foreground as though non-diegetic. This fusion of distance with proximity, like the frequent framing of landscapes through car windows, generates suspense in the most mundane of moments.'Taste of Cherry' confounded Western audiences accustomed to dramatic performances and emotional manipulation, with its apparent absence of explanation or conclusion. It is never explained why Badii wants to commit suicide but he tells the seminarian that Allah wouldn't want any of his children to suffer so much. We never see him take his pills but when the rains fall on his open grave we are encouraged to believe that he has 'tasted the cherries' and re-evaluated life. In his circuitous search for meaning, it could be said that the soldier represents the state; the seminarian, religion; and Azeri, what can happen but also what has gone before. Badii is in turn ignored; told to continue living but not given any reason to; and finally, told to experience nature and appreciate the little things. The theocracy has little to offer him.The Iran depicted herein is a melting pot, or cultural mosaic, of other Muslim world countries. We assume Badii is ethnically Persian, but his fellow travellers all hail from foreign lands. Perhaps this signifies the finity of the revolutionary state, in that no one has a vested stake in it's perpetuation. All three nations represented were embroiled in conflict at this time, and maybe it was three foreign perspectives who had known conflict which Badii needed. Much has been said of the very final scene which I neglected to mention above as I do not myself consider it part of the narrative. It consists of camcorder footage of the director and crew shooting scenes of the Army on patrol and would seem to me to be a disclaimer for the Iranian censors who I imagine would be concerned with the film's themes (it's only a movie). And it's inclusion in the Western release would seem to highlight this issue for foreign audiences.",

Again, this doesn't sound like much but it is so much more than it sounds thus, is underestimated. This brilliantly simple concept is played with and utilised in an impressive and effective manner but what is perhaps the most impressive, however, is that the film never feels forced nor does it at any point self-raise itself beyond that level of 'too artsy-fartsy'.Although the other two Iranian films I've seen could be called art films due to long takes and emphasis on the ordinary, Taste of Cherry does these two things with the distinct feeling that there is purpose behind it \u0096 the long takes of the Range Rover weaving in and out of the dusty mountains on a relatively sparse quarry on a public holiday are there to make us feel like ground is being covered and the film is advancing as our focus: Mr. Badii is telling us and his passenger about his plan \u0096 this was much more effective as it was entertaining to watch than a goat grazing in a field for no apparent reason.The film also uses its timing and concept to good effect. The audience are clueless to as to why he's driving around looking for people so desperately; one person tells him to go away aggressively, one wearing a U.C.L.A. top tells him passively and he even talks to some random children half way through it all. Also, his actual plan when announced to a young soldier is the first time we hear of it so the director is cleverly trying to place us in the young man's position which is rather effective. Along with this, the plan is only gone through in a laborious fashion twice, after the first time \u0096 we know exactly what his situation is and what he wants.Apart from some of these great things, it also gets the basics right: the director makes great use of the location, the atmosphere is as tense in the early part as it is desperate and depressing in the second part and although amateurs, even the acting pulls through. You can argue that most foreign films are enjoyable over ones we're familiar with since it's such a change and they just seem more sophisticated- this isn't always the case as they can fall flat on their faces to some audiences but if you can look past the silly 'behind the scenes' ending, Taste of Cherry holds up with an ambiguous ending and just as a well made film.",

All his helper has to do is to is to fill the grave Mr Badii has already dug, once he is sure that Mr Badii has died. Mr Badii found it really difficult to find an assistant. After many unsuccessful efforts to convince a young Kurd soldier, an Armenian seminary and others to help him, he meets a taxidermist who needs money to take care of his sick child, who agrees to assist. The taxidermist, too, had previously attempted suicide.We are taken on a dusty road through a bleak mining landscape which suits the ambiance of the film perfectly. The film picks up momentum slowly, but once it got going, I sat glued to my seat.We never know why Mr Badii is driven to suicide, but that is not important. By leaving such detail out, the director and writer, Abbas Kiarostami, elevates the film above the level of just another sentimental drama about death, with a clear beginning, motive and ending. This film is much more, in fact. It is an incisive meditation on life and death, clearly elucidated by the taxidermist, and by the silent action and demeanour of Mr Badii. The ambiguous ending is perfectly tuned too. This is a fascinating film with a lot of food for thought. It is clear why this film was awarded one of cinema's highest awards, the 'Palme d'Or' in Cannes.Cinematography, acting and directing are top-notch. 9/10.",

            "content": "This film is both glorious and disappointing. I had seen several Iranian films when this one came out and I was not alone in finding the Iranian cinema one of the most, if not THE most vital in the world. I am a great lover of '60's cinema (Godard, Bunuel, Antonioni,etc.) and have found myself bemoaning the return of straight narrative as the strategy of even most of the most gifted filmmakers. But Iranian cinema in general, and Kiarostami in particular seemed to have found a way to question narrative structures while keeping covenant with them. The ambiguity between what is constructed and what \"actually happened\" was a strategy that kept me on my toes while viewing these films. But Taste of Cherry, in my opinion, announces the beginning of the decadent and self-conscious period in Iranian cinema. We start to know that this kind of \"post-modern\" event (in this film, the ending) is going to take place, and, in fact, the film seems to be rather smoothly constructed towards that point. Iranian film begins to seem very \"Cannes friendly\". This doesn't change the enormous achievement of this film. We can't (for example) blame late Beethoven for the fact that his changing the composer's role and position has led (in the almost 200 years since) to so much overblown, ego - driven music. All of this is what Adorno and Horkheimer called the Dialectic of Enlightenment. Mastery becomes gradually vise like and degenerates as it tightens. And the fact is, Iranian films since the time of this film have pandered more and more to Western expectations of them. Michael Galasso's score for Secret Ballot was a real shock - the sparse use of music in Iranian films was one of the elements that had created a different kind of attention - one was not \"lulled\". And I was lulled by the use of the \"mother wit\" trope in this film. An illiterate ethnic minority character talks about the \"little things\" that make life worth living. So unfortunately similar to the role of mere facilitator that Blacks have so often in American films (not just old ones either - see That Thing You Do!, for example...). Thank Goodness for the po-mo ending. It keeps the film from going in the direction of a \"philosophical\" film which engages with the pros and cons of suicide. There's a Jewish joke: 2 men are sitting at a table. One says \"life...is like a herring with cream sauce\". The other responds \"life...is like a herring with cream sauce? What's that supposed to mean?\". And the first one replies \"How should I know? I'm not a philosopher!\". And that's one of the reasons (among many others) that I love Kiarostami and this film. He's not a philosopher. He doesn't try to explain. He shows. He feels.",

There are no gimmicks or flashy tricks here. It really is just a man driving through town and its surroundings, talking to people and trying to fulfill his final mission. That's ambitious. And at some points it really works. The early scenes especially, where we're only beginning to know this strange, slightly uncomfortable, but also very charismatic man, are really good and I enjoyed the mystery.Unfortunately the narrative isn't that great. The movie has a tendency to jump from one important scene to another with no bridges, no explanations. I'm sure there are people who would say that the movie doesn't need those bridges. I disagree. A true master of his craft may be able to tell a story without them, but for most of us, those bridges and story-telling techniques are there for a reason. They are needed to make the story flow more smoothly. To leave them out altogether makes the movie seem jumpy and jarring, as if there wasn't enough time to film certain scenes. On the other hand, the ending scene feels completely unnecessary and stylistically broken.Still, the movie has its upsides. The dialogue, for the most parts, is really good and captivating, as are the actors. The movie has its own unique style, the lack of music fits the mood and I actually enjoyed the story, unevenly told as it might have been.

Forget the in depth analyses of 'Sight and Sound' and 'Time Out'; elliptical reads as a synonym for unengaging in this case, and the 'twist' ending is not very clever at all. There is really no excuse for this; 'The White Balloon' also suffered from a miniscule budget and being produced in a country with a short cinematic history, yet it worked against these odds to produce a fascinating look at Iranian culture through fresh eyes.

While Godard's brand of realism creates a sense of ambiguity along with a sense of discomfort in his audience (Bande a part - Band of Outsiders), Kiarostami achieves the same sense of ambiguity while taking his viewer to an uncommonly tranquil if not peaceful place! It's astonishing that this movie is ultimately about suicide and after wards one feels exhilarated! Kiarostami never even shares with us why Mr. Badii is trying to kill himself and we as the audience never feel that we need to know! I suppose that underscores Kiarostami's mastery of narrative.Kiarostami is obviously a very heavy intellectual deeply rooted in the Iranian literary tradition of the 1930-1980 period. The literature of this period produced the likes of Hedayat, Chubak and Alavi as great examples of writers who explored realism as a genre. I feel we see quite a bit of those writers in Kiarostami's movies. The hallmark of the genre is its attempt to withhold moral judgment on its characters at the expense of leaving the reader/viewer with a deep sense of ambiguity, and Kiarostami is extremely successful at this task in his recent movies. It's all the more remarkable when we realize that Kiarostami started out as a children's film maker and in his early movies he had to communicate very clear and unambiguous messages. Even some of his well known earlier works (Traveler, 1974) were done in that tradition. But in his recent movies, while he maintains the simple, easy style of a children's movie, he has achieved the mastery of realism by leaving out any attempt to judge his characters and in so doing has achieved a state of purity that is extremely rare among his peers.If you're looking for a movie to offer a very complicated plot or one to move you to the edge of your seat, this isn't it! If you're looking for a movie that will linger in your mind and make you wonder, then this may well be it! Think of it as an artistic version of the thinking man's version of \"It's a wonderful (medidation on) life\" (with apologies to Mr. Capra!)",

Most of the scenes were improvised, as mentioned in the trivia section.Kiarostami has maintained the tempo of the film in a very beautiful way. His use of voice overs is unique. But most of all, the best part about the film is the way he reveals characters' faces at the climax of a conversation/scene. He is a directors' director.Now getting down to business. The movie is too slow. Such long shots with so many pans and tilts, so many similar looking shots, too many voice overs, the monotony of a car just driving around the hills, same angle of camera inside car etc. The saddest part of the film is when the protagonist leaves home in the night and is standing on the hill. It's so dark that you can't see a thing. And God! That scene is so long. Why do you take a shot if you aren't showing anything? But the let down of the film is the ending. It is a smart move, but it seems contrived.

Perhaps it appeals to those who are bored to death of watching the regular commercial Hollywood films, those who can't stomach really strong films and those who wish to create non-existent depths in a very one dimensional film. Some comments mention cinematic genius in scenes, some looking for metaphysical meanings in the sound of a helicopter or the scenery--I guess you could look at it that way- or anything in that way. But please, there are no comparisons between cinematic greats like Tarkowsky, Bergman and others.Kiarostami was and is one who takes the safe path always... never provokes, never motivates and all \"debates\" sparking from his films are merely because few can believe that there is nothing more to it than what they see and hear. A weak director with no signs of improvement, in my opinion.And a film best described as a placebo... you think you get an effect, and perhaps that's good enough for the critics and the fans of this film.

Still it does not impose any view on you, if the life is always merciful and happy or not. You yourself should decide the end of movie, then after watching the film it lives with your unconscious mind. My view is that Badii is looking for a marvel or sign to believe in life.

            "content": "This would mark my very first venture into the world of Abbas Kiarostami's cinema, and I had to pick the Taste of Cherry based on its Palme d'Or victory, totally unaware of that mind boggling video coda at the end, and a highly debatable and analyzed one at that.Homayoun Ershadi stars as the protagonist Mr Badii, who has such a morbid request that he's driving around looking for volunteers to fulfill, with a car load full of cash to serve as a reward. But he's not looking for any Tom, Dick and Harry to complete his wishes, which we learn to involve his suicide, and for the chosen one to return to the location to call out his name twice. If he was to respond, then the helper is to assist him out of a self-dug hole. Otherwise, 20 shovels of sand is needed to bury Mr Badii, and the helper can make away with his car load of cash, with absolutely no strings attached thereafter.Shot mostly within the interior of his vehicle, and rarely, if not never do we see the characters interaction within the same camera frame, the narrative's punctuated with plenty of solitude and contemplative silence when Badii is on his own in search of his mark, and then filled with plenty of dialogue depending on who's making the case \u2013 Badii in trying to convince those whom he had conned into hopping into his travelling vehicle, or those that he had roped in to help \u2013 a Kurd, an Afghan and a Turk, attempting to either escape, or trying their best to talk him out of his thought. During those moments the film becomes a an extremely talky one within the close confines of the car, and leaves you constantly wondering who would finally have the upper hand.I appreciated the last one best, from which the title is sort of touched upon. The Turkish taxidermist who once shared the same thoughts about ending his own life, and it becomes a moving piece on life itself, how with all its problems and troubles, is still something worth seeing out properly. We see the extremes of characters just amongst those three in Badii's car, where one is frightened enough to pretend that he seemed indifferent, and wanted to bail out and go back to the safety net of his routine life, uninterrupted by life's sudden challenge, and the other extreme that one preaches why he would not support Badii's quest, but does not go beyond mere words. Then there are those who are stuck in the middle, where money plays a key into covering one's heart, because it's needed to facilitate a personal gain.Given my continuous curiosity of the landscapes in Tehran, Iran, where this film was shot in, it doesn't show you much beyond the brown-orange environment of a construction site that Badii frequently uses, going almost to the top where he intends to end his life at. It seems as bleak as Badii's mission can be, with Kiarostami never flinching into giving you additional clues as to the background of this man with the singular passion, which admittedly does waver a little, leaving the ending open ended, with the coda making it all a little more complicated. To me, that little scene looked more like a making-of documentary that couldn't find its proper place in a DVD extra.In any case, if time and the National Library permits, I'm likely to be picking up more of Kiarostami's works to see if indeed they're my cup of tea, or otherwise.",

            "content": "There is the old, and often neglected, nostrum about 'gilding the lily.' I was reminded of this watching Abbas Kiarostami's acclaimed 1997 film Taste Of Cherry (Ta'm E Guilass), co-winner of the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, for while it comes close to being a great film for the bulk of its running time of 99 minutes (not the oft-claimed 95 minutes), its much discussed ending, of breaking the fourth wall (ala Ingmar Bergman, circa the 1960s) to reveal what has just been witnessed is all a film, is one of the worst endings for a film of quality I've seen; perhaps even worse than the tacked on uplifting ending to Akira Kurosawa's otherwise stellar Rashomon. The basic problem with the ending is that, unlike in Bergman's run of self-conscious films (Persona, Hour Of The Wolf, Shame), the big 'revelation' that the film is a film comes after we've sat through it; assuming that even such a fourth wall braking could surprise one in these times. Even worse is that it undermines the penultimate scene, which is a better- if not great ending, but one which would arguably qualify Taste Of Cherry as a great film overall. And it is an all Kiarostami film, good or bad, as he produced, wrote, and edited, as well as directed it.Critics, pro and con, have prattled on about Kiarostami's meaning or intent, in regard to the videotaped, not filmed, ending of verdant hills (contrasting with the rest of the film's ruddy barren rock landscapes), but always seem to miss the result, which is that it emotionally deflates the whole story. They claim things such as Kiarostami's abnegation of preachiness, a disdain for tearjerking, some psychological reason why the reveal of the film's fictive nature, at its end, is profound, or his desire to make indeterminacy the film's major motif. Yet, before the ending of the film, it is not preachy, jerks no tears, is clearly fictive, and the penultimate scene spells out indeterminacy far more powerfully and cogently than the ending does. When confronted by such realities as this it is always amusing to watch fans of an artist alibi for failure when the simplest answer is simply failure- that Kiarostami did not believe enough in his film to let it end at its best point. And what the filmmaker desired to achieve, if any aside from himself could divine such a thing, is immaterial to the viewer.Taste Of Cherry has moments of rapturous almost pure cinema, where the visuals alone can sustain the film and indeed do last longer than the lesser parts of the film, but, ultimately, that quality and its often clever script, are undone by the ending. It does not ruin the film, in terms of making it a bad film, but it does keep it from the elusive goal of greatness, for it plays out as an attempt at innovation when, in reality, it was already decades pass\u00e9 (as well as being inappropriate to end the film). Kiarostami's film views the human from a telescopic and microscopic position, and which is the more revealing is debatable. That such an innovative approach is substantially ruined by the poor ending is a shame, even if as human as the dilemma it traces.",

            "content": "This was a completely blind viewing experience for me, as I didn't know what the movie will be about, where it takes place, or even how long it will be. So the first thing I tasked myself with was figuring out what country's production this is.A quick note - I'm not too familiar with Eastern hemisphere cultures, so my initial thoughts were far off.My initial thought was that the movie is set in India but I quickly eliminated it after seeing Arabic text on a yellow phone booth. I then shifted to it being Saudi Arabia or the United Arab Emirates, one of the wealthier countries in that region with a higher chance of having a high-quality movie production. I changed my mind again after the Kurdish soldier was introduced, shifting to Syria. Kurds don't have a country they could call their own but they have big chunks of their population in Syria and Turkey (another note - apparently Iran has the second-highest population of Kurds right now, only Turkey has more). The introduction of the Afghan seminarian confused me but I stayed with Syria in my mind as I had forgotten how big Iran is in that region. It was only the mention of Iran that made me realize I was wrong and I could finally confirm the location and rest this little mini-game I had in my head to rest.The first mind-blower occurred early on in the film. During his encounter with the Kurdish boy, I got sent all sorts of alarming messages in my head, just being worried where this will go. My mind was racing between \"Is he a serial killer?\" and \"Does he want the Kurdish boy to do the killing for him?\". No, the truth is somewhat darker and more unexpected than I imagined - he wanted the Kurdish boy to bury him after he commits suicide. That twist was monumental for my watching experience as it made me say \"wait, what?\" in my head and I found it difficult to assess the situation. The revelation that the protagonist has serious suicidal tendencies left me in awe and for possibly the rest of the movie.One question that remains in my head is whether the passengers our protagonist had were real or were they just in his head. After watching Shutter Island (2010), I have an irrational fear (or just a suspicion that anything in a movie could be a dream or just a fabrication of one's mind. Given how much attention to small details is given in this movie, I wouldn't be surprised if that was the case here. This idea came to me when the third passenger, Mr. Bagheri came into play. Before his introduction, our protagonist visited a quarry. He enters his car and then we hear that a passenger enters with him and starts a conversation. We only heard his voice for a few minutes before he kindly asked to take a different, more scenic, a route that the passenger is familiar with him. Only then do we get to look at him and his mustache. This sparked an idea that the passengers could have been a fabrication he created to cope with his suicidal thoughts. The first passenger, the young Kurdish boy, represented his youth and his time in military service - their interactions were focused on the training camps and practices and when the topic of suicide came up, the young boy fled out of fear. The second passenger, the Afghani seminarian, represented his present and his spiritual side - their interactions were focused on how religion defines suicide and attempts to talk out our protagonist from going through with his plan. The third passenger, Mr. Bagheri (who may or may not be Turkish), represented his future and wisdom - different than the rest, our protagonist stayed silent and just listened to his passenger, probably because he doesn't think there's a future for himself. With the amount of ambiguity this film leaves us with, this is just one of ten or a hundred theories that could fit the scenario. I grew fond of this \"three ghosts\" scenario as it helps me cope with what happened later.I was also questioning why this movie is called \"Taste of Cherries\" but it was quickly pointed out that there's was a quote in the movie that I missed. The refusal to live is compared to giving up the taste of cherries. It's also worth mentioning that the tree, by which our protagonist has dug his hole, possibly is a cherry tree too.Possibly the most talked and discussed part of the movie everyone talks about is the ending. It's like the center of all the ambiguity in this movie. From a first glance, it's just CCTV footage from behind the scenes. But thinking more about it (and hearing others discussing this scene), it kind of works as a tool to bring us back to reality, to remind us that this was all a movie. Though for me, reality often seems boring, though I'd rather be left with the ambiguity of the previous scene, still wandering in the universe of the movie and my dreams. One of those dreams includes an alternative ending, where Mr. Bagheri came to the hole at 6 AM and called Mr. Badii. Before he got the chance to call Mr. Badii's name a second time, the Kurdish boy entered the scene, calling Mr. Badii's name, and both of them just quietly looked at each other. Not long after that, the Afghani seminarian joined the gathering. All three of them showed up at the scene. And that's where it ends.This coincides with a meta-theory I heard that involves a scenario where Mr. Badii lives and the CCTV footage was from the future where he decides to make a movie about his experience that day.The last thing I want to talk about is how this movie felt a bit Kafkaesque without bureaucracy. Our protagonist wants to commit suicide out of nowhere and is going through a bewildering process, where neither the cause of his suicidal tendencies nor the nature of his relations with his passengers is made clear to us. He is compelled to struggle until he finds the person fit for the task to achieve his goals but the whole ordeal ended up being disorienting and a bit illogical to the point where it can be considered that success becomes pointless in the first place. At least that's how I interpreted the scenario where Mr. Badii did a U-turn to come back to Mr. Bagheri to... make sure if he still is okay with the plan and to suggest shaking him up a little to make sure. The irony of our protagonist's reasoning and the reaction is what made this feel emblematic to Kafka's work. I'm not saying Abbas Kiarostami was inspired by Kafka when making this movie. I can even be wrong with seeing a connection to Kafka in this movie. I never referred to anything as Kafkaesque with bureaucracy before, this is a first. This is an idea that buzzed into my head during the movie and I just wanted to share it.This movie requires a bit of patience and attention. The majority of the plot comes from dialogues, which isn't always easy to follow. Lucky for me, the movie made it easy to stay attentive. From simple details like showcasing the multiculturalism in Iran to exploring the reasons why it's worth living, I feel like this movie and everything that happened in the span of ~1,5 hours will linger in the back of my head for a few more days. It has that kind of energy that just makes you think and it doesn't disappear the second the movie is over. I don't think this would work well for people who have short attention spans but for those, who look for something deep, something thought-provoking and something spiced up with a darker undertone, this movie should be a top pick. It's safe to say that I've never experienced a movie like this, nor by the plot, nor by the ambiguity in the actions. One movie that comes to mind is The Guilty (2018), which also had the majority of the plot in dialogues only but that's about it. Another unique experience Is in the bag.",

            "content": "Pretentious was the word that came to my mind when I stepped out of the cinema after I saw the film, but the word did not sit quite right because I did not find the film pompous. Rather, the director made a sincere attempt to communicate his vision but fell short.I am a great fan of slow-paced, understated films, and love the work of Andrei Tarkovsky, Michelangelo Antonioni, Yasujiro Ozu, and some aspect of Theo Angelopoulos's work. So when my friend bowed out from the screening as she heard the film is boring, I wanted to give it a try. Unfortunately, not all boring films are the same.The choice that the director made to shoot the first part of the film (i.e. cross cutting the protagonist and the passenger in the confinement of the vehicle compartment and never place both in the same frame; rather closely cut medium shots of the vehicle steadily moving through the dirt road in a bleak and dusty landscape) might be an attempt to represent the inner state of the protagonist or the lack of connection between the characters, but it was too monotonous and repetitive. I believe many audiences are turned off by that and failed to see the slight change in the scenes after the protagonist drops off his last recruit (taxonomist) who attempted at length to persuade the protagonist not to commit suicide. Realistic but mundane and home-movie quality of the visual throughout the film doesn't help either. However, there is an attempt to represent the shift in the way the protagonist perceives his surroundings after he drops off the taxonomist. In particular the sunset shot in that segment was beautiful, but too short for my taste. Also it is too easy (or I dear say \"too cheap\") to choose sunset as the life's most beautiful moment.What I consider the best scene in this film is when the protagonist steps out of his car to observe heavy machinery moving earth on dusty hillside. One may find the metaphor too blatant, but the shadow of the protagonist against the falling earth and the protagonist being shot through the dusty haze while the worker urges him to move on were nicely executed.The ending of the film is controversial, and I belong to the naysayers' camp. It is not the quality of the visual but the choice. Some suggested that it might have been needed for political / religious / censorship reasons, but I didn't find it necessary for the pure story telling purpose. If the director feels compelled to provide relief to the audience, I prefer \"The Machinist\" (2004) or \"A Beautiful Mind\" (2001) ending, but such relief is not necessary unless the film is a high impact and moving film (sorry \u0085) As for the visual, we can cut him some slack as I read somewhere that the real footage was lost and he needed to substitute with video footage he had.",

Neither a soldier nor a seminary student will help him. A doctor asks him if he is willing to surrender all of the physical and emotional immediacies of life-- \"the taste of cherry\"-- just to end his unspecified suffering. Crows flap. Maginficent colour bleeds from the sun. The man takes too many sleeping pills and lies down in the grave he's dug, as the sounds of rain and nature, along with darkness, envelope him.Fascinating is Kiarostami's coda. What does it mean? Does he suggest that what we've seen has been nothing more than the film-maker's visual trickery, and that our emotional investment in the protagonist has been in vain? Has the protagonist become merely an actor? Has there in fact been death and re-birth? Kiarostami has said that he finds Quentin Tarrantino far more interesting than his films, which he has described as \"too forceful.\" His own work suggests the opposite of the American's work: that the hypnotic rhythms of daily life, verging on boring, open the mind to new possibilities, ones that creep back to us in the days and weeks after a viewing. Kiarostami's films only seem simple and boring, but they resonate the way Tarkovsky and Kieslowki's finest work does.",

            "content": "I'll watch just about anything; I can appreciate almost any style of film. Having come across 'Taste of cherry' strictly because of the awards it has won, I did have some expectations. By the nature of its construction this certainly won't be for everyone, and potential viewers should be fully aware of what they're getting into before watching.The premise is very simple: A man drives around, seeking someone willing to bury him after he commits suicide. It's not truly necessary to discuss narrative further, because there is little further narrative beyond the details of the drive and the conversations held. 'Taste of cherry' is as minimalist as one could get: there is no music save for what may be heard in passing on a radio. Outside of dialogue, sound is limited to the rumble of the car engine, and ambient sounds of the surrounding scenery. The film is comprised in no small part of many long, continuous shots, whether the camera is stationary for an exterior shot following the vehicle along a road, or within the vehicle as it focuses on the protagonist.There's no dramatic twist or turn, and no overarching grand meaning. There's a kernel of wisdom imparted in one of the film's conversations, conveyed naturally in passing and not heavily emphasized. But at no point is there any added emotional weight beyond what a given viewer may derive individually from the film. Even the ending offers no resolution - open-ended, with the narrative concluding abruptly.There are some gorgeous shots arranged or captured, including much footage simply of the hills outside Tehran. Save for the pure essence of a viewing experience, the imagery seen through the camera's eye is the most immediately fetching aspect of 'Taste of cherry.'For all these reasons, the movie is undoubtedly a hard sell for a general audience. It's very much an art film, and likely to find favor only with viewers who are receptive to this style. This is famously on the late Roger Ebert's list of most hated films; I find no particular fault with the feature, and even I have a hard time engaging with it. Still, for anyone open to features of this kind, and fully aware of what to anticipate, 'Taste of cherry' is worth watching.",

But I did find myself wondering about how it would be read by a sophisticated Persian audience. Produced in a society where freedom of speech is not protected and where a fundamentalist religious cabal controls the government and the media, the film is surely trying to ask us to read between the lines on various points.In particular, I found myself wondering if it was attempting to address, not so much the morality of suicide, but perhaps that of homosexuality. For the first full 20 or 30 minutes of the film, we get the distinct impression that the leading man is looking for a sexual hookup rather than for what he allegedly turns out to be seeking. He initially hits on innocent-looking young men in need of money. The violent reaction he gets from one fellow indicates that at least one of his targets has interpreted his intentions in just this light.The overtly sensual film title and the not-too-subtle imagery of the hole the hero wants to be buried in seem fairly suggestive as well. And rather oddly at one point, he discusses \"suicide\" as if it were something calculated to make him happy... rather than dead.In any case, I don't really believe that coded socio-political subtext can really serve to make a movie more artistically successful than it would be on its more basic merits.

            "content": "After reading about Iranian culture and cinema I have to admit I was intrigued and pretty excited to see Taste of Cherry. However to be perfectly honest I found this film incredibly boring and tough to sit through, mainly because of the cinematic strategy used throughout. The film implements a lot of long static takes, most of which are in the same location, which elongates the time and space of this film to give it what I would describe as a real life pace. That combined with very little to no extreme time jumps makes it feel like we are simply watching a complete day of this man's life, which in terms of making this film feel real helps a lot, but making it entertaining, however, hinders it quite a bit. It seems obvious to me that the director, Abbas Kiarostami, wanted to draw importance to his messages by making the situation they're framed in as real feeling as possible, but when you sacrifice entertainment value to do so it's my belief that you're only preventing your message from getting across to the audience.The film has a pretty ambiguous ending; we as an audience are left to wonder whether or not Mr. Badii really killed himself followed by behind the scenes footage of Kiarostami and his crew making the movie. While it's my belief that he did kill himself, I can honestly say that at the end of the movie I couldn't have cared less either way. Kiarostami does little to nothing in terms of characterization to get us to sympathize with Mr. Badii, and the fact that we as an audience aren't made out to root for Mr. Badii as a character is what fuels my belief that he did indeed kill himself. It also keeps the audience from wanting to engage in any discussion over the material, which I'm sure is not what Kiarostami intended on. I assume the behind the scenes at the end was some sort of reminder from Kiarostami that we are indeed watching a movie (maybe as some sort of disclaimer?). However I agree with Roger Ebert in his review of the film when he said, and I'm paraphrasing, something along the lines of \"we don't need to be reminded at the end that this is a movie because the slow and boring pace throughout is reminder enough.\" At the end of the day I understand what Kiarostami was going for and applaud him for trying to make his film feel as real as possible, but it's the lack of entertainment value that kept me from truly enjoying it, and after all we are in the entertainment industry.",

The film has a slow, meditative style reminiscent of Terrence Malick, which is perfect for the film's profound subject matter.  The protagonist's actions and conversations are all quite fascinating, at least at first.But after the first hour, I just felt... bored.  Minute after minute of the Range Rover driving across the bleak, barren Iranian landscape.  Look, there he goes again.  And there he goes again.  Yup, he's still driving around.

We eventually see that his driving is out of despair, that he's quietly desperate with troubles only he knows, and it's a profoundly touching metaphor for the human condition. Score yet another one for director Abbas Kiarostami.The people he meets are also struggling, or have struggled, and in one way or another reflect aspects of himself - his service in the Army when younger, when he was happiest, the dogma of his faith, which forbids suicide, and an older man who was once suicidal as well. In the flash of a moment of enlightenment, the older man saw the miracle of life and our connection to everything around us. I loved how his relating this story did not suddenly \"fix\" the younger man - there are no easy paths out of depression.The imagery in this film is rugged and rather desolate, fitting well with its emotional mood. In one scene we see the man's shadow against the earth and rock being dumped by construction equipment, and I felt a crushing sense of our transience. In other scenes he looks up into the sky at a flock of birds, flying deliriously, at a jet plane streaking across the sky, and at a group of schoolchildren in a giant ring from above, and there was something incredibly powerful about these moments, akin to the Japanese concept of yugen. Nothing is more poignant than the shot of the clouds passing before the moon in an otherwise pitch black night, which was extraordinary, and should have been the film's final moment. Seeing the film crew in an odd bit of behind the scenes stuff was the only off note in an otherwise brilliant film, even if Kiarostami was echoing Shakespeare and signaling that \"All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players.\"",

This humanization contrasts with the disturbing storyline of a man who wants to kill himself and begs numerous strangers to have the decency to assure that he is buried.  The film counterposes the suicidal man's request for basic decency in an indecent act (suicide), the hesitation of the characters to associate themselves with such an act, and the dignified presentation of these characters by the director.  As usual, within these jagged thematic lines, Kiarostami leaves plenty of room for contemplation, and this makes the otherwise slow pace of the movie welcome.

Then, in what can only be called a feat of cinematic insanity, we get a behind the scenes look at the movie. Complete nonsense. I have never spent 2 more pointless hours in my life. And believe me, the rest of my family felt the exact same way. I sat there for the last 3 fourths of the movie thinking, \"Am I really watching this? Something mildly interesting IS going to happen, right?\" NO.",

Some viewers will not like the endless driving around in the reddish landscape, but the play of light on the hills and the changing colors of the sky are very beautiful. While the mood and images are great, I remained puzzled by a lot of things--maybe due to a culture gap, or maybe because the director deliberately had to make the narrative and its outcome ambiguous for the censors. Some viewers thought this was a life-affirming movie in which the protagonist rejects suicide; I am not so sure--see for yourself, but the ending seems unclear to me. I was also uncertain whether the characters have some sort of allegorical function (as suggested by Alex from Bologna) standing for Military, Religion, Nature (or science?) or maybe representing the \"unity-in-ethnic-diversity\" of Iran. Being neither Muslim nor Iranian, I felt I needed more explanation to appreciate the movie fully, and I haven't found that kind of interpretation in the reviews or on-line comments. And how come the title refers to cherries, when the conversation is about mulberries?",

And the scenery was very symbolic of the man's unhappiness in his life, dry, and desolate. However........ I could not have been more disapointed in the ending,  which overshadowed any symbolic or spiritual depth of the movie it was trying to convey. The shift was WAY too drastic. It was a rude jolt. And it left me feeling as though a movie with such great potential was basically ruined.  I have seen other Iranian films, and they ranged from good, to quite spectacular,  but this one was disapointing, mostly because the potential was there for it to be much better.",

The whole Nietzschean saying about being able to sleep many a night with the thoughts of suicide ring harrowingly true. The details in the movie are so flawless that it almost stings you. The conversations, the thought process, the scenery, all add to the tragic finale we all expect to see. But here, the Director surprises us. The end may disappoint us but it also makes us think 'Why'. And this is perhaps the most important question-answer that one can take from the movie. I have only watched it once but I don't think subsequent viewings will help much in telling me what the movie is about- Life, Death, Suicide, Choice or is it all a Mirage.

            "content": "There is a certain type of film that is so interesting, and different that it polarizes it's audience in astounding ways. No example better suits this than when Abbas Kiarostami's \"Taste of Cherry\" premiered at the 1997 Cannes Film Festival. The audience reacted colorfully with cheers and jeers. It was awarded the prestigious Palme D'Or for its excellence. The critics hailed it as a work of genius, except for one. The great Roger Ebert. In fact, he hated it. He called it a \"lifeless drone\" and \"excruciatingly boring\". He even placed it in his \"Most Hated Films\" list. How could a critic of such fascinating intellect and unmitigated love for all of cinema have such harsh words for Taste of Cherry? What was not to understand? Or like? Sitting down to watch this picture for the first time, I felt uncertain, but entirely interested. I've gone through an entire semester of watching so many classic pictures of the world. Some of them have become one of my all-time favorites, and others, you couldn't pay me to watch again. Kiarostami didn't impress me too much with \"Where is the Friend's Home?\" In fact, if I were to call a film a \"lifeless drone\", that would be the one. Actually, it would be more like \"The Color of Pomegranates\", sorry, I'm not quite over that one. Regardless, Taste of Cherry, I found to be a surprisingly sweet end to the semester. It's far from a perfect film, but it's far from anything I would say is boring or bad. If anything, it left a very good impression of Kiarostami for me. The entire film has me wondering about our main character, Mr. Baadi. Who is he? Why is he driving around the Tehran countryside? Why is he constantly looking for hitchhikers to pick up? More importantly, and much to the very point on everyone's minds, why does he want to commit suicide so bad? Every time he picks up a new stranger, he tries to reel them into being his accomplice for his suicide attempt. He just wants someone to bury with. Nobody really understands why. It's not like he's a depressed man of any sort, especially due to how calm he seems as he's talking to the people he is driving. Kiarostami brilliantly tells us nothing about Mr. Baadi's character, except for the fact that he is an awfully lonely man, who just wants to die. It makes the majority of the film's existence seem gloomy and introspectively miserable. Mr. Baadi's truck, almost in itself, seems to symbolize his isolation from the world, the darkness that lurks inside his head, and the shell to which he is about to hide himself in as he lays in his grave. Its almost as if Mr. Baadi is looking to be isolated from the rest of the world forever, but looks for one last companion to join him. It is unclear if he likes company or not, but what is clear is that Baadi seriously has a death wish, and not in the Charles Bronson kind of way. The only section of the film that left me cold was the end. A few minutes before we get a fantastic final scene in which Baadi buries himself in the spot in which he told his passengers to meet him. It's in the early hours in the morning. Kiarostami holds onto a shot of Baadi staring out into the distance, which is framed absolutely beautifully. Then, as Baadi reaches down and lies in the hole, he simply waits, and stares up at the moon. This scene is so peaceful, but so incredibly eerie and sad at the same time. The sense of death was imminent, even though his accomplice never showed up. This would have been the perfect spot to end the picture. But the picture doesn't end. Instead, we are treated to some B-Roll footage of the film. Why did Kiarostami felt the need to put this in? Some have argued that this helps blur the line between reality and fiction for the audience. Some have argued that it lightened up the ending of the film in order to assure the audience that everything was OK in the end, but did a movie like this really warrant such an ending? If anything at all, it just seems really overly self-serving of Kiarostami. Like he just wanted to place himself in the picture somewhere, ala Alfred Hitchcock. I hear that most of what he believes in himself is what inspires him to make movies, so I'm guessing that Kiarostami is one very narcissistic director. The B-Roll footage just didn't work at all with me. It didn't make me feel happier coming out of the film, because I was happy with where it left off to begin with. OK, fine, I like a bit of grimness with my movies. Don't we all, though? Taste of Cherry is a sublime piece of art house cinema, and unquestionably, the masterpiece of Kiarostami. It's a striking soliloquy about the preciousness of life, and the unrequited friendship of others in our darkest hours. It's not a bright film of any sort, but in examining the dark context of suicide, it goes about it with class and fascination.",

We have no idea why exactly Badii is willing to kill himself. And in this lack of explanation not only we're asked to focus on the 99-minute journey instead of the destination, but we're also implicitly informed that Badii's soul is no longer being tormented but it's already gasping out its last breath; which means it's not dead yet, though. If it hadn't been for Homayoun Ershadi, Badii would've seemed dead, even as he's driving his truck. For Eshadi's sorrow-laden eyes expose the misery that burdens Badii's soul, and in turn, prompts him to \"free (himself) from this life.\" Still, this sadness that engulfs him is indicative he's alive inside and even clutching at a straw even if he himself is completely unaware of that. There's nothing surrounding him that could urge him to give the idea a second thought. All we see are some bleak and dismally empty and desolate landscapes. The sound of silence permeates the screen to reflect the excruciating ennui Badii feels, and the only sounds that break the silence intermittently are the cacophonous sound of machines or other jarring sounds. Kiarostami also detaches him, and us, from the world Badii has long forsaken, making us listen to conversations with the speakers almost off-screen. And the only life form Badii seems to observe are not of the people he interacts with-simply because his mind is solely concentrating on seeking someone to assist him do what he wants-but those of crows. Along his journey, innate goodness of human beings like \"refraining from doing any harm to anyone\" or \"offering a hand whenever encountering someone in need or trouble\" are manifested, but so long as these traits interfere with Badii's intent, they come off as hurdles to what he plans to do and they just end up passing by him unnoticed. As he's in a stage beyond any rational thinking, religious and philosophical advices fall on deaf ears as well. No one can change his mind. A long lecturing would definitely be of no help, unless beneath its veneer of didacticism lies a life-affirming power and an irrefutable optimism of an epiphanic impact. Perfect denouement! What kept me from giving this five stars is that the lack of information about Badii distanced me emotionally from him at the beginning. Regardless, Taste of Cherry is a minimalist masterpiece that celebrates life by showing us its value and beauty hidden in its simplicity.",

            "content": "I was meaning to check this film out for a while as it looked pretty interesting. While I wasn't blown away, I did like it quite a lot and I definitely think it's much better than the 1/4 rating Roger Ebert gave it.I think it's at its best when it depicts Badii's conversations with the various people in his car. There's three main people he encounters throughout and each of them react in a different way to his offer. The first is a shy Kurdish soldier. When Badii encounters him, their conversation starts out normally, but as it goes on and we see Badii suggest driving around with him and how he drives further and further away from where the soldier plans to go, this conversation grows uneasy. We see that the soldier increasingly grows disconnected by how he doesn't talk much and often asks to be driven back or let out. It's a quietly tense sequence. The second man is a seminarian. With this section, I found their musings on whether suicide is a sin to be interesting as it opened up a few thought provoking questions. The third man is a taxidermist named Mr. Bagheri, the only one of the three who's named. He agrees to take part in it since he needs the money to take care of his sick child, but warily so since he attempts to persuade him otherwise during the car ride back to his workplace. With his scenes, I could tell he was disgusted by what he'd have to do, but felt that was his only choice in the matter. I also found the story of his attempted suicide to be powerful. All three of these characters had differing personalities and reacted to his offer in different ways, each of which were compelling.The look of the film is also worth praising as a number of scenes and aspects appealed to me quite a lot. The sequence which stood out the most to me was of Badii sitting in an active construction site as he was covered in a cloud of dust. This is a well-shot and sort of eerie scene which causes you to wonder whether something bad might happen to him or if he's thinking of giving up. Since it's edited in a way which makes it seem as if Mr. Bagheri was in his car throughout this sequence (as if he already discussed his plan with him) makes it feel all the more mysterious. Another notable sequence is how a thunderstorm began as Badii lied down in the hole. It's a small touch to the scene but it adds a lot more power to it since everything which happens before the final act is shot in broad daylight. This shift in lighting adds a lot of mood to that moment. I also liked the shooting style. Although most of the film takes place in his car, I liked how the camera wasn't restricted to showing everything from inside the car as it occasionally showed shots from outside, overhead views of him driving by, or people looking at him as he drove by. This may not seem like a major detail, but I think this style adds a lot of variety concerning the camerawork and since many of the final portions don't take place in his car, this caused the \"transition\" to feel more natural rather than abrupt.The coda is probably what's discussed the most. It's a surprising scene and I didn't expect it to end the way it did. I was really mixed on it at first, because I felt like the film risked a lot on the strength of it and I wasn't sure I preferred it over how I thought the film was going to end (or, the two ways I thought it was going to end). Not knowing what to make of it, I looked up some theories and the reading I settled on is that it shows life isn't meant to be analyzed but merely experienced. This fit well into Badii's characterization since we didn't know much about him (his family, his job, his motivation for wanting to take his life) other than a brief mention that he was in the military. So, in a way, the ending works at extending the mystery of his character. As a whole though, while I at least appreciate it, I'm not sure I got much out of it. There is, indeed, an air of mystery which flutters around Badii which is heightened by the ending. I thought of this throughout the film, in fact. My experience though was that, by the time Mr. Bagheri appeared, I wasn't thinking of how mysterious he was as much as I was focused on wondering what his outcome would be. Shifting the focus back to the mystery of his character served to show something I wasn't interested in seeing explored at that point. With my first viewing, I thought it was surprising and had fun pondering over it, but when I rewatched the film after processing the coda, I was taken out of the film when I got to it as I found it to be jarring.Even though I don't think the ending works, I still enjoyed this film quite a lot on the whole and I found it to be an engaging experience. I definitely recommend it and am surprised that it isn't discussed here more often.",

            "review_title": "Actually a rather heartwarming meditation on life and death, even with Kiarostami's attempt at completely alienating the audience by the end.",
            "content": "Perhaps the title I used is baffling to some, for the minimalism of the camerawork is often little more than one or two cameras fixed to the truck, the lack of a soundtrack, the long, quiet scenes, the emotional distance, and the lack of an explanation for why the main character wants to commit suicide is already alienating enough for most. What I'm speaking of in particular, however, are the metanarrative elements featured at the end. I really don't feel this ending significantly affects the core of the film. I vacillate on whether I prefer having it or not. It's just kind of there--not good or bad, rather neutral even. What precedes it could have easily been an ending itself, but perhaps it felt too simple, too much like your average film, despite its ambiguity. Maybe it was even too dark of a note to end on in Kiarostami's mind. I've read that Kiarostami tended to feel uncomfortable crafting his films as normal stories; there always had to be some kind of convention-breaking technique, so a somewhat jarring metanarrative sequence seems to be utilized for this purpose. I honestly think the film is simply too good to be concerned with this scene, that may or may not be there due to Kiarostami's artistic insecurities or out of a necessity to create a more artistically nuanced film. However, some might find Jonathan Rosenbaum's rejoinder to Ebert's scathing review enlightening; Ebert criticizes the ending as a \"distancing strategy,\" but Rosenbaum sees it as the opposite, giving plausible reasons all the while. I'm not sure I'm fully convinced by everything he says, but it's worth a look, and the segment can be read on Taste of Cherry's Wikipedia page. I've chosen to open with commentary on the ending because this is probably the most contentious element of the film, and I will return to the subject later.If you were to start watching without reading the synopsis, it might take a while to figure out what's going on. For long stretches, the main character, Badii, just drives his truck around in circles, trying to build enough rapport with various men, to the point that he feels he can request their help with overseeing his suicide. Essentially, he has already dug a grave, and they are to check whether he is still alive in the morning. If he is alive, they will pull him out of the grave. If he is dead, they will bury him. He's offering a large amount of money to complete the job. He has several failed solicitations before he finally reveals his motive.Badii's failure to state his exact reason for committing suicide is probably an attempt to speak of suicide more generally. It's not a personal story of suicidal intent with the intricate details and introspection that would entail--the intent seems to be universalization. The only thing that can maybe be ruled out is that his choice is because of a lack of money. Would-be laborers, desperate for work, are shown at the start, and an immediate impulse might be to assume his reason is one of economic uncertainty, but Badii has plenty of cash. The actual reason is probably more abstract or spiritual. Still, his current occupation is never discussed, and though he has a big sum of money, it will eventually dry up. Labor is a human need that is usually required in some form for a satisfactory life. Though I don't know anything about this period of Iran's history, every single character Badii speaks to in length is a refugee (none of whom seem to be doing well monetarily), and the seeming economic downturn or labor shortage exhibited by the men at the beginning of the film suggests not only Iran, but the general region, is going through a difficult period.There are three main encounters. The first is with a rather shy soldier, revealing that Badii was also formerly a soldier, and it was a very happy time in his life. According to the interaction, it seems that the nature of the Iranian military has changed compared to when Badii was enlisted, and its current state lacks the satisfaction of his memories. This is perhaps a clue of what is lacking for Badii, but he never becomes too specific about anything. The second encounter was with a seminarist. I scoffed that Badii would even consider asking a Muslim or any religious person to help him with such a task as suicide, but the theological debate is a necessary component for a very in-depth exploration of suicide. When it's brought up that while suicide is a sinful act, it's also sinful to harm people, and Badii's lingering, lashing out as one is likely to do when discontent, leads to the frequent harm of other people, I think it's at least clear that his reason transcends base materiality... that his reason(s) are of a more spiritual, abstract, or metaphysical nature. The third encounter is with a Turkish man. Though Badii did most of the talking with the soldier, and there was a bit of back and forth with the seminarist, he lets the Turk do almost all of the talking. Though he desperately needs the reward Badii is offering, he inexorably gives his best pitch to talk Badii out of committing suicide. The Turk had himself attempted suicide years ago and rebounded from his despair due to a seemingly inane occurrence, a simple joy dissuading him from following through, he alleges. His lyricism leads him to refer to another simple pleasure, after which the film is titled. The tree the Turk chose was a mulberry tree, and the mulberries are a central part of his story, just as the cherries from the cherry tree could be for Badii.The encounter with the soldier ends abruptly and is barely a conversation. With the seminarist it is a conversation with a peaceful parting of ways, but there is no agreement. Notable is the monotonous sound design and the circuitous dirt roads with the first two. And, finally, with the Turk, there's a monologue with the intended resolution that Badii desires. The Turk even requests they take another route, and there's finally a change of scenery, replete with more greenery and life, and there is a destination, as opposed to the aimlessness of the prior encounters. From many scenes onward, it even seems that the Turk was very persuasive, and Badii is having second thoughts, truly juggling with life versus death, instead of pure suicidal intent. To see things as they are from many angles is helpful, but ultimately, it's a solitary choice that Badii confronts.Most of the supposed weaknesses the viewers see in the film, I see as strengths. Potentially, it's all rather alienating, or even boring, to some viewers. But Kiarostami is not concerned with the minute personal details of a single character in this work of fiction. He wants to focus on the larger concept and the debate around the concept and to apply these themes more broadly. There are merits to going down either path. Kiarostami made a choice, and many people would prefer he made the other choice. And that's understandable. Aside from the debate on life and death, there's also the filmic techniques. In some ways they are crude (though I think they're far more palatable than the similarly filmed Ten). There's the occasional camera filming the truck from afar, but in many cases there are just two cameras that cut back and forth to show the scenery outside the window or the two different actors. There's nothing flashy here. It moves at such a serene pace that it feels like the viewer is spending the entire day with Badii, basking in all his grief and loneliness. There's no sentiment or cue to be sad as would usually be found in a soundtrack. There's the sound of the wind, of birds, nature, tire against gravel and the hum of the engine, and nothing more. Everything is competently done, but never to the point that it distracts or draws attention away from the mundanity and universality of Badii's plight.In the atmospheric closing scene (before the true metanarrative ending sequence), with its fade to black, heralded with the sound and light of the elements in the dark, there is no conclusion. We don't know what his choice is. This, along with the limited details leads me to believe that it is indeed the universalization of this meditation concerning life and death, of suicide or the decision to carry on, that is central to the film. One likely reason for this device is to internalize some of what was discussed and our own thoughts concerning the topic, and to then redirect them not to the fictive universe that Badii inhabits, but our own existences and the existences of others. The actor playing Badii is shown walking amongst the crew. The metanarrative ending presents us with a scene of collective creation instead of the telegraphed ending of the choice between life or death. To a shared interest and a stake in something, much like Badii must have experienced while in the military. In some sense it's a culmination of many details throughout the movie. It's an uncanny mixture of documentary footage and an acting out of a fictional past with a regiment of soldiers, a representation of Badii's happiest moments. The tree at full bloom looms near, presumably the same one Badii dug a grave under. The Turk's botched suicide also involved himself hanging from a similar tree. Although it ends on a more pleasant note, we're intentionally left with no answers, because Badii's choice, the dissatisfaction leading up to it, and a search for meaning is something we all experience to some extent, even for those of us who don't externalize it all to the dramatic binary of suicide or not suicide, as Badii has done.",

The premise for the film is so simple, that a westerner wouldhave likely turned it into a self conscience short film. This is whywhat Kiarostami has achieved is all the more amazing. In the West,cultures outside our own are often thought of in the most condescendingways. If a culture is outside the West - it must be third world -barbaric - bankrupt and full of religious dogma. Here Kiarostami pullsthat curtain of ignorance gently aside in a simple exchange betweenErshadi and a young seminary student (the wonderful Mir Hossein Noori).Ershdi the Iranian seems to have some preconceived notions about thecomings-and-goings of an Afghani person in his country.

I find 'Taste of Cherry' one of those and that's why I loved it.. but if slow paced movies bore you and somewhat boneless plots irritate you then definitely its not your cup of tea.. From cinematic point of view, the landscapes of desert are worth watching.. the mood of the movie perfectly harmonizes with the mental condition of the protagonist.. some of the scenes and dialogs vividly express his thinking process but then there are some scenes that are apparently seems simple or dialogs that are said in a very casual way but after looking back and rethinking make you doubt if it was as simple and casual as it seems to be or if I overlooked what was trying to convey in a subtle way.. as I'm still thinking about the professions of all the men he met in reference to symbolism.. and last but not the least, its ending is an enough premise to start an endless debate that will lead to nowhere I guess.. but reading this quote by Abbas Kiarostami solves many puzzles.. When we tell a story, we tell but one story, and each member of the audience, with a peculiar capacity to imagine things, hears but one story. But when we say nothing, it's as if we said a great number of things. ... It's necessary to envision an unfinished and incomplete cinema so that the spectator can intervene and fill the void, the lacks. ~ Abbas Kiarostami",

In A Taste of Cherry Kiorastami reveals his sheer talent of innovation. Most Iranian movies are thrilling in that they are confined to one specific story which is related using a series of incidents taking the audience straight towards its conclusion. During that time, the director uses various cultural and humane references to cinematically enrich his film. Here, Abbas Kiorastami uses the Iranian landscape and simple moments from its culture to bring the worldwide audiences to Iran for about 95 minutes. The cinematography is predominant and keeps our attention to the flow of images. This movie has been masterfully screen-written by Kiorastami who makes the audience meditate on life and death while trying to unravel the mysteries the movie carries. The mysteries are never solved but perhaps if they had been, the audience might have felt deeper sympathy for the protagonist. There are a few setbacks in the movie the director might have overlooked. At the beginning during his pursuit of a helper it was implied to me that the protagonist is homosexual. The way in which he approached men on the road gave me that feeling. I think that is an unnecessary issue to the plot. Overall, the movie, in its tranquility, made me meditate on its themes and to develop a fascination with the ways of Kiorastami!!!",

It is a quiet movie that looks at a life and death situation without passing judgment or, most strikingly, giving easy answers.Iranian auteur Abbas Kiarostami's \"Taste of Cherry,\" examines the middle aged Mr. Badii as he drives through the hilly outskirts of Tehran, searching for someone to rescue or bury him.He's dug an open grave beneath a lonely tree in a desolate patch of reg. He is wrestling with killing himself, yet he needs someone to properly bury him.There is a cultural bias at work in this film that I wish I understood better.  I don't profess any expertise in Muslim culture and I would love to understand either the cultural or scriptural underpinnings of the film.  Still, a simple human decency is on display here that extends well beyond the cultural settings of the film.  Indeed, these people are not the Muslims I see portrayed on television every day.\"At six in the morning, come and call me twice,\" he says to a poor soldier who could use the six months wages Badii offers.  \"If I reply, take my hand. If I don't, throw in 20 spades of earth.\"\"I can't do this for you,\" replies the soldier.  \"You can't throw earth on someone.\"Badii is banking on this somehow.  As he grapples with his moral dilemma, he seems to be casting about looking for someone to give him any reason to continue.Badii, you see, is an everyman, grappling with the big questions and suffering this life while praying God for solace.  As such, the viewer doesn't even need to know the protagonist's particular anguish, but can fill in the blanks themselves. The viewer can lay down in a bed of earth, amid gathering storm clouds and fallen leaves, and if God is merciful he will take him or answer him.Video Vault Rating: 8",

The gorgeous mise en sc\u00e8ne is engraved within the precise sculpting Kiarostami so elegantly designed to make you feel like the fading main character. The quiet sensibilities are a signature of Kiarostami's work, but yet in Taste of Cherry, they feel fresh and the most humanistic. Operating within the confines is of the individual perspective, rather than his more community-based reflections as seen in The Koker Trilogy, the roads to decision making are laid down in the cultural center of the main character's framework. However, it is this perfect framework that itself is mysterious and subtle, not entirely introducing us to the complete psyche and erosion this man has experienced. He hides the motive, but the eyes say it all. Much like the scenery around him, our main character longs for an escape from the man-made structures and burdens of the road, not visibly seeing the sweetness within everything. Kiarostami uniquely exercises the themes of suicide and longing into a didactic but private venture. I've never seen a subject like this so beautifully and patiently handled. Apart from addressing the diverse community within Iran, the film reflects the scene as reality in perspectives. Each passenger Mr. Badii picks up introduces expressions authored by not only Kiarostami himself but by a higher power within the landscapes itself. (Won't spoil anything, but the ending reinforces this idea of everything being authored to covey a sense of participation, something Kiarostami loves to do.)Ever since my first watch back in August, I've been thinking about Taste Of Cherry nonstop. I won't get into it for the sake of spoilers, but a specific scene has stayed in my mind. The desperate and pitiful emotions that inherently surfaced from that first watch gave me a new perspective in the second watch. Rather than feeling pity for him, I felt only him. Looking outwards into old dusty buildings with the air seeming to calm me down and not suffocate my words, everything seemed right and natural. It's the little things this film does so well. From staying on a shot for just the right amount of time, to the immersion in the car, no film quite captures this indistinguishable tenderness that Kiarostami masterfully composes. There's not much more I can say that educated film scholars haven't already described, but I can only encourage to look further into the films of Kiarostami as pieces of himself.A poetic beauty of a film, with immaculate technicalities and sensibilities. A masterpiece that rightfully deserves all praise. It's quite possibly a film I personally needed right now, making me feel less alone and more appreciative of the taste of cherries.",

For me, ''Taste of Cherry'' represents a conscious gate to experimental cinema. I can't label it as one of the best or the worst, for I do not have enough experience regarding this part of the cinematic world. Nevertheless, I am sure that movies like this are necessary from time to time, even if just for expanding your cinematic horizon and nothing else.That being said, I can't use the word ''enjoyed'' , for the nature of the content doesn't allow me to, but it was watchable, very thought-provoking and daring in its vision. It made me feel a bit depressed, my vital functions slowed down for a while; I wasn't bereft by hope, yet forlornness was to be felt everywhere. That's a good sign, it means I was transported into the world of Mr. Badii's (or as he said, I just comprehended the world; it's enough though, I wish I'll never end up in a place where I'd understand those feelings completely).It wasn't perfect, Mr. Badii lacked some traits necessary to make him likeable but I think Kiarostami used most of his energy on tackling the sensitive topic of suicide, even more sensitive considering the historical context of the place in which the movie was created. The ending is still a mystery for me but I'll keep deciphering it till I figure it out.An 8,5 out of 10 from me.",

The film of A Taste of Cherry by Abbas Kiarostami begins with Badii, a middle-age man, driving around the outskirts of Tehran looking for someone, someone compassionate offering them a large sum of money, to help with his deed \u0096 to commit suicide. The concept of suicide becomes universal and the film opens the idea of the meaning of life and death.The cinematography is very sharp with its crisp color of the desert land of Iran. The yellow and orange soil surrounds the people in the film and the small green trees become part of earth, almost indistinguishable. As Baddi searches for a compassionate man the tension grows. The viewer wants to know why, the reasons, he wants to commit suicide. The first two men reject his offer without knowing the job he wants them to do. Later, the young soldier is frightened by Baddi thinking he is a madman and runs off after learning about the job. The next man is a seminarist and has some compassion, but clearly does not help him because he believes it is wrong. He tries to lecture Badii that according to the Imam and Koran, suicide is a sin. But as we go on with the film we begin to wonder that maybe the reasons are no longer necessary, but it is now the question of the desire to commit suicide. The last man agrees to assist him and tells him that he once did try to commit suicide, but once he has a taste of cherry, the smallest goodness of everyday life, he did not.The way that the film is shot, using mostly medium close-ups in a desolate area, and most of the conversation taking place in Baddi's car, makes the viewer uncomfortable, but attentive. The dark theme of the film, somewhat like the poets of the romantic era, depicts the natural landscape of Tehran \u0096 the soil, trees, and rocks \u0096 with the doubt of a man to live and choosing death. This \"negative capability\" compels the viewer to try to understand Baddi.The ending of the story makes the viewer believe that this is only a movie within a movie, much like the French New Wave films of Goddard and Truffaut. Yet, the story raises expectations and makes the viewer hope that Badii will change his mind, but Kiarostami leaves it up to the reader to fill up the blanks in the story.",

In TC, we are not able to have any clear idea of what Mr. Badii has gone through (his past) that prompted him to \"end\" his life.(Unlike in Robert Bresson's 'A Gentle Woman' and 'The Devil, Probably', where we were able to gather some personal reasons surrounding the self-destructive act of the characters.) Rather, we are already confronted with what he would want to happen with his life.Meanwhile, in TE, we have known beforehand what motivated Mr. Yamashita to adopt an introspective and reclusive attitude:the interrelated feelings of pain, guilt, anger, shame and resentment over his wife's unfaithfulness and the murderous act that was instigated by it.It's the classic narrative device of cause-and-effect, of showing what happened and what needs to be done.(Another film I can think of where this was shown fluently and masterfully is Claude Chabrol's 'Story of Women'.)But other than the \"anti-heroes'\" psychological and emotional make-up, the thing that's worthy of our attention in the two films is the way they uphold the beauty and value of life, how they make, in one way or another, a few shimmers of light penetrate through the dark corners of Mr. Badii's and Mr. Yamashita's lives.The end result may be essentially different in the two cases, but what actually counts are the efforts shown--mainly by the people around them--to effect a shift in outlook and attitude toward life of the two desperate and pessimistic souls.They may have missed their goal, but at least they worked for it.In TC, the people whom Mr. Badii has asked for \"help\" have paradoxically made their part in \"altering\" his morbid aim through their own life stories (as he gets to converse with them)--that is, that just like Mr. Badii's, theirs is a life also full of struggles and woes (some are mundane, while some are crucial), but that they haven't thought (or so it seems) of ending it through their own hands.Life has still more to offer, with some of them just being overlooked because of their \"ordinariness\", like the sweet \"taste of cherry\", as pointed out to Mr. Badii by the museum curator.Ironically, this last man is the only one to have finally consented to his plan.While in TE, the greatest chance for renewal and redemption is laid before Mr. Yamashita in the person of the young woman, whose love, acceptance and forgiveness can be easily seen and felt, if only the former would finally free himself from the phantasmagoric world he has built for himself and his one and only \"confidante\"--the eel.This is further aggravated by the \"ghosts\" that are always there to haunt him (some are formed by his own mind, while some are simply around, like a fellow inmate who now works as a garbage collector).Though the definitive moment of release and realization (the film's climax) still happens, we aren't completely sure as to the new steps Mr. Yamashita would take.There's simply no and-they-lived-happily-ever-after type of ending here.Mr. Badii and Mr. Yamashita are two dark souls in search of light at the end of the tunnel, even if it's not certain whether they are actually willing to reach such a destination.But we can assuredly say that the persons who brought them to life on the big screen--who else but Kiarostami and Imamura--do have an immense faith in the preciousness and richness of life, despite all the adversities and challenges, be they of a catastrophic (like in their two early masterpieces--the atomic bombing in Imamura's 'Black Rain' and the earthquake in Kiarostami's 'And Life Goes On') or of a personal level (as seen in their award-winning films).The two directors' filmic style is to emphasize the one thing that matters most by making it absent in their characters' lives.It's having to experience emptiness in order to yearn for something.",

Kiarostami's minimalist treatment yielded some beautiful images: Badhii's shadow projected into the pit, the emerging nature as Badhii drives Bagheri to the museum. But the end makes it all worthless. I have no idea why Kiarostami would want to put it in his movie. It's cliched, tiresome, and has absolutely no relation to the movie or its themes. The \"ironic\" music played over it made me grind my teeth. It's the worst kind of cop-out: one that thinks it's the point of the whole movie. An infuriating conclusion to what could have been an excellent film.",

The main character meets two men he asks for assistance with his suicide, both of whom refuse. Then there is a scene where he comes across a big piece of road construction or rock crushing equipment, where he parks his vehicle and sits for a while. A worker asks him to move his vehicle so the construction vehicle can perform it's work, and the man gets up, apparently to move the vehicle. The next moment shows the man in his car talking to someone, who is not seen for a few minutes, but is clearly the third man he picks up to help him with the suicide. But what I assume would be the first part of that sequence, where he meets the third man, is not shown. I wonder if TCM omitted that part, since otherwise the film moves in a perfectly linear fashion.",

Story revolves around a middle-aged suicidal man who is in quest for the \"right\" person to bury him. The protagonist tries picking up one after the other in his dusty white Range Rover, starting with a young boy, a seminarian then a taxidermist and proposing each of them to bury him in exchange for a financially rewarding sum.One aspect of the film that truly needs to be appreciated is the landscape shots. I haven't seen any other film that portrayed a deserted landscapes and construction sites so exquisitely. And not to forget the narration that goes along with it.Director often uses long shots and rarely do we see the protagonist with other characters in the same frame. The camera is adroitly positioned so as to make the viewers feel and experience how Mr. Baadi himself sees and interacts with his passengers. This helps in invoking empathy and establishing an intimate connection with the protagonist's suicidal thoughts without having to reveal much about the character's woes and struggles.",

The rawness of emotion is unbelievably gripping and the scenery that lapses along with it completely fits the tone of the main character. It is a teetering of emotional stress and love that is unparalleled to any other film that has tackled the topic of suicide. Although it is simple on the surface level, I could not look away for one moment and was feeling the whirlwind of emotion that the main character felt in a way that was incredibly profound and jarring. This is a film that is important not just for the world of cinema, but for humanity at large. It is a must watch for literally anyone. Phenomenal filmmaker!!",

Should the break in narrative mean anything to the audience? How is it significant that the only connection made is one with no origin? Likewise, the solider and seminarist as well as guardian all feel as though the concepts were taken from Kafka without exploring the realms of their social positions.Overall, an interesting if failed experiment.

Much of the area we see is dusty, barren rock. The man prepared his grave on a slope, by an unpaved road.Yes, watching a man drive can feel maddening, but as our frustration grows, we find ourselves emotionally connected to the protagonist as he struggles to find an ally for his final act. We see him lie down in his grave, in the blustery dark. Then a miracle occurs.The conclusion may seem confused and abrupt. Resurrection? Reality's rude intrusion? One thing is certain. Rain in the desert brought the rock strewn slope to life, covered in new grass.Homayoun Ershadi plays the the suicidal Mr. Badii with quiet intensity. We feel his anguish. Director Abbas Kiarostami made courageous decisions telling this story. If a measure of a film's greatness is how much we think about it afterwards, this movie fits the bill.",

When I analyze this technique of recording, I can say that with that style of recording, that is, with these still and long frames, the inner state of the main character is emphasized, which we do not know very well, but we know that he wants to commit suicide. So with this element of calm and long frames, we notice that in fact the main character is with a solid character, good nerves and is resolute in fulfilling his purpose.Through the talks with his traveling companions, we learn a lot about him, his happiest time spent in the army, and the fact that there he met best friends for the rest of his life there.Through the last conversation he leads with his companion, Mr. Bagheri, in the film is added another element the taste of Cherries.
