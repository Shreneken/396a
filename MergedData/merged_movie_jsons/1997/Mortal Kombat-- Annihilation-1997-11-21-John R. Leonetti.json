He does a crop cut n wears a designer waist coat n military boots.I found Sandra Hess as Sonya Blade more attractive than the previous part's gal.Talisa Soto who played Kitana is only 4 years younger to Musetta Vander who played Kitana's mother. I found Musetta more attractive than Talisa.Brian Thompson as the main villain is no match to Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa.",

            "content": "By all that's Holy! A film that made me cringe the whole way through! Dear Lord how the studio bosses must have laughed as they counted the money that they made off this turkey. Now, I thought the first MK was an OK film, great soundtrack, OK acting and plenty of fighting. A good no-brainer actioner. But this....this....defies belief.How on Earth can you get such a bunch of wooden actors together and still manage to hide all the strings? It comes to something when you look at a film and can honestly say the best actor in it is Brian Thompson! The actors playing the bad guys overacted so awfully it was painful to watch, expecially the centaur guy. He exuded ham to a level I've not seen before.The special effects were truly special, but only in a \"special needs\" kind of way. Looks like they were lifted straight from the video game itself. Laugh as you watch something resembling a dragon perform martial arts very badly. Laugh as Brian Thompson turns into a......thing. Laugh at the terrible lack of detail in it all. Laugh, laugh, laugh, laugh and laugh again, right up until they slap the straightjacket on you and cart you off to the loony bin. Because only someone truly demented would want to sit through this terrible, terrible film. Eh? What's that Doc? Yes, I know I sat through it. But it was all in the name of science, you see. I was doing research. By the way, you couldn't loosen this jacket a bit, could you?Anyway, as I say, the best actor was Brian Thompson. Only he saved it from getting a 1, but even then, the rest prevented it from getting any more than a 2.Avoid it if you value your sanity!",

            "content": "I made the mistake of going to see this movie, first show, first day, in the theater, in 1997 when it was released. The first movie wasn't bad. It wasn't great, but it was fun. I expected more with the 2nd. The only thing I knew about it going in was that James Remar was replacing Christopher Lambert as Rayden, which I was upset about, but I thought Remar would do a good job.Boy, was I wrong. The whole cast, even Robin Shou, who was decent in the 1st, and great in Beverly Hills Ninja, can't seem to act his way out of a paper bag in this one.*** Mega Spoilers, Cause You Shouldn't See This Movie Anyway ***The big mistake the writers made with this movie, was trying to incorporate all of the characters, even the hidden ones, from not just Mortal Kombat 2, but Mortal Kombat 3 as well. (The plot is taken from the MK3 video game). MK1 survived multiple heroes because there were only 3, a trio, a team, and their \"teacher\" Raiden. And only 2 bad guys (Goro, Shang Tsung). In MK2, we have a virtual plethora of heroes and baddies.Heroes (8): Liu Kang/Rayden/Kitana/Sonya/Jax/Johnny Cage/Nightwolf/Sub ZeroBaddies (14): Shao Kahn, Shinnok, Sindel, Motaro, Jade, Sheeva, Cyrax, Scorpion, Noob Saibot, Ermac, Rain, Baraka, Smoke, and Mileena.Yeah, I thought that was a lot too. All of these characters have lines and/or fight scenes too. This doesn't even include the characters from the games that are mentioned, but not shown. A bunch of these baddies (and even some heroes) die or just leave, never to return, in about a minute after they appear. For instance, here's the plot of some of the sub characters:Rain: Says hi, gets thrown into a fiery pit.Sub Zero: Shows up, says hi, fights and kills botty Smoke, tells Liu Kang \"you are not ready\", then disappears, never to be heard from again. Smoke: Killed within a 2 minutes by aforementioned Sub Zero.Baraka: er.. I think you see him.. once.Mileena: Shows up, attacks Sonya, somehow dies from a bonk on the head.Scorpion: Shows up, fights Sub-Zero, kidnaps Kitana, disappears.Johnny Cage: Shows up, says hi, Shao Kahn breaks his neck a good minute into the movie. Sheeva: Has a few lines early, Liu Kang kills her in under 10 seconds in her first fight.Those are just some examples. On top of these character issues, the entire movie seems to have been filmed on the first take. There are literally *tons* of continuity and placement errors. A few quick examples, all from the same 10 minute stretch:Rayden leaves Sonya, and tells her to find her buddy Jaz, then to head to \"The Temple of the Elder Gods\". Of course, after she finds Jax, she immediately knows where it is.When we first meet His Jaxness himself, he punches into a wall trying to kill Cyrax. We pan away with his fist somehow stuck in a wall with a good inch of space around it. We pan back a few seconds later, and his entire arm is stuck in the wall.Sonya gets into a muddy fan-service fight with Mileena. After a muddy battle, and a split scene later, all her clothes have somehow been drycleaned.During aforementioned Muddy Fan-Service fight, Sonya gets thrown into a rock. This big rock, about 10 times the size of her, waggles and moves a bit with her weight falling on it. Again, those are just some examples, but they're *rampant* in the movie. As for the plot, well, the idea and premise is interesting, but they delve way too deep into it. It would have been better if they kept it superficial, the way they did in the first movie. But, no, they had to try to explain everything: life, existence, the tournament, and why the toast always lands butter side down.The result of all this atrocity is a corny, poorly directed, aterribly written, underbudgeted (looks like most of the stuff *I* could have pulled off with my home computer) nightmare that's worth buying solely to laugh at. 0/10",

            "content": "Oh, boy, where do I start with this movie? I still want to think that this movie was just an evil joke. The first Mortal Kombat was such a fun high action packed film that was just a great time. I still watch it like crazy today, it's got so much energy and makes me want to play the game again and again. So since the first film was a success, naturally they were going to make a sequel and they did manage to mess this one up badly. I'll start with the \"plot\" first and explain in a moment all the badness that is the mess.The evil emperor Shao Kahn opens a portal from Outworld to the Earthrealm and has reclaimed his queen Sindel, who is Kitana's long-dead mother. Earthrealm is therefore in danger of being absorbed into Outworld within six days, a fate which Liu Kang and the others must fight to prevent. Sonya enlists the help of her old partner, Jax , while Kitana and Liu Kang search for a Native American shaman named Nightwolf , who seemingly knows the key to defeating Kahn. Kitana and Liu Kang dispatch him with the aid of Sub-Zero, but Scorpion suddenly appears, attacks Sub-Zero, and kidnaps Kitana. Now Liu must save her as well as Earth from Kahn who wishes to blend the realms together.I'm sure you've read and heard it before but in case you haven't and you're reading my comment first for some reason to find out what makes this a bad movie, well read away. First off, what bad replacements for the actors: Sonja, Johnny Cage, Rayden. They don't look anything like the original actors, it was just bad. The acting is horrible, like really bad, like they went to the Keanu Reeves school of acting bad. The special effects are something that could be easily done on an elementary school computer. The editing is too fast and gives you a massive headache.There's a mud wrestling match between Sonja and Mileena, which I'm sure the director was telling them it was for the \"cool effect\" of the fight while I'm sure he was playing with his stick shift behind the camera while this was going on. There is no explanation for why Scorpion and Sub Zero are back, except that Sub Zero is Sub Zero's brother, yet they have the same names? Doesn't make much sense does it? The fight scenes are so badly put together, there's a scene where the ninjas look like they're doing ballet, not fighting. Rayden spends so much time talking to the group and finally when he has a chance to fight, he bows out like a coward.Yeah, that's just some of the film that I'm describing. Scary sounding, isn't it? I don't know what they were thinking when they thought that this was OK to put in the theaters. The first film was a lot of fun, it stuck true to the video games and is one of the best video game movies of all time. This just happened to have the characters in a crappy Mortal Kombat \"plot\" that made no sense. Just skip this movie, it's just horrible.1/10",

            "content": "You know, I really liked the original Mortal Kombat. Sure they ripped off the premise from another movie, but at least it was good (Enter the Dragon). I loved the games until the 4th one and was widely known as being one of its best and most devoted followers. So maybe all this is why my then-girlfriend's idiot stoner brother told me that he heard this movie was incredible, and I excitedly went to see it.I'm a patient guy, and I have almost never felt the urge to walk out of a movie due to boredom (Tank Girl is the only other one I recall). But MKA here is a joke. If you really feel the need to see this movie and be surprised, then be forewarned because there are spoilers ahead.Here's one right off the bat. MKA isn't a sequel proper to the original Mortal Kombat. The original MK was, reasonably, based on the first game. A couple future characters made cameos, but that's it. So it stands to also reason that MKA would be about the second game, the one most fans widely regard to be the best. But whereas the MK film was made at the time that part 2 was yielding to part 3, a lot changed in the extra couple years it took for this film sequel. As MK the movie was leaving theaters, MK3 the game was getting kind of a lukewarm reception, and people got sicker and sicker of it by the time MK4 came out. By now the games were in 3d and the storyline had gone from basic Enter the Dragon tournaments to all out apocalyptic robot wars and sorcerors controlling the fates of a bunch of new, generic characters. Until its decent reinventing in 2002, the MK games had hit a rough and oversaturated spot and would take 5 years to bounce back.So here in this worst time comes MKA, which skips the best chapter of the games entirely and jumps in at sort of a story junction between the 3rd and 4th games, the worst.  So we have characters from all 4 games running around and interacting, which is goofy as it is, and things get worse when sense is tried to be made of it. For example, (spoiler), in maybe the first 2 minutes Johnny Cage, a main character and semi-hero of the first movie, is summarily and unceremoniously killed off. My guess for this is because he wasn't in the 3rd game.Soon after (more spoilers. In fact, there will be several so if you continue, do at the risk of ruining the wonderful cinematic experience that is MKA), robots from game 3 come in, negating the fact that their sole purpose in the games was to hunt Sub Zero, a character killed in the first movie.  Leading the attacks by these fiends and others is Shao Kahn, who in the first movie appeared as a giant demonic face in the sky and here appears as....a masculine human being.Making things moe complicated is that elder God Raiden, played by Christopher Lambert in the original, is here played by someone else and seems to not want to fight at all, as the character has gone from wizardly power god to short haired, weasely Power Rangers nerd, giving up his immortality in the process and teaching our heroes a thing or two about friendship and courage.  Huh?Sticking things out, unfortunately for them, are Robin Shou and Talisia Soto, who play central characters Liu Kang and Kitana and who've returned from the original film. This time, neither of them are allowed to do anything much more than look shocked at the stupid story developments, and Liu Kang engages in a few fights that capture none of the magic or uniqueness of the original film. And in fact this goes for any fight in this film that I care to remember. In the original, the fights were well choreographed and showcased a good selection of acrobatic and martial arts skill. Action was conveyed through close combat, good angles, and lengthy tradeoffs. And at the very least, there was a genuine moment or two where one might say \"wow, that was a cool move!\". This time, a lot of the action is illusional, with the camera making quick cuts and sudden moves to sort of convey that stuff is going on. There's nary an actual hand-to hand combat scene that lasts more than 30 seconds, and when you see what else was thrown in instead, you'll want to kill someone yourself.For example, remember the character Baraka, with his beast face and bladed arms? He's here, and in fact is joined by several identical others, who assault Liu Kang with their reflective cardboard blades in a high-flying trapeze act straight out of the circus.  And what about Sheeva, 4-armed character that should have been the answer to decently done Goro, 4-armed creature of the original film? Well, whereas he was conveyed through puppeteering and animatronics, here Sheeva is played by a tall woman in generic spandex who tries to look menacing and does a couple unthreatening hops with her cheesy extra special effect arms.Things (don't) pick up later on, when Liu Kang randomly encounters Native American character Nightwolf, who explains that Liu must harness his \"animality\" to succeed. Anyone familiar with the MK universe knows that the \"animality\" was a ridiculous player rumor which supposed that the MK games contained a method of killing one's opponent by turning into an animal and committing not a fatality but an \"animality\". This dumb rumor was added to the 3rd game as fan service, and apparently delighted the producers of this film enough that it was actually explained as a real, feasible occurence. \"Feel your animality\", N.Wolf says to Liu, urging him to harness the beast within. Mr. Wolf then briefly shows Liu how to do it, and then asks,\"pretty cool, huh?\"We who haven't left the room yet are saying \"no\", but oh boy do we still get a fun surprise. At the end of the film, Liu Kang fights with big masculine guy (er, Shao Kahn), and instead of actual wanted fisticuffs, we get to see the two of them feel their animality and turn into giant, god awful stupid computer-generated beasts who do combat with each other. No, I mean it.  They turn into giant computer animated beasts. And we're not talking about Gollum of the Lord of the Rings here- I mean big, shiny, plasticy-looking \"we know we want to make big magical creatures but don't yet have the technology to do anything but make them eye-strainingly obvious\" effects. Liu Kang could reasonably have turned into a cool chinese dragon or something, but instead winds up being this big-nosed, cross eyed, dopey dragon thing. Shao Kahn turns into something equally ridiculous and less memorable and the two have it out. Then at the last minute Shao Kahn's sorceror dad decides he's gone too far, disgraced the family name by becoming a crappy visual effect, and makes him disappear or something. Then everyone hugs, and more or less runs far, far away.I hope that this has been an accurate rendering of what my feelings are for this film, because I actually haven't seen it in several years. I don't hate myself enough to watch it more than that. But if you want an actual review without the sarcasm, just look at it this way: It is an insult to the MK franchise and its fans, it fails as a follow-up to the fun original MK film, it fails TERRIBLY as a martial arts film, and in general it just is a dumb waste of time, an arbitrary, thrown-together cash-in sequel. Do yourself a favor and just watch the original, and if you still crave more, go play the games. And if you do insist on seeing this movie, then at the very least inject some fun into it like trying to figure out where those Baraka masks were purchased.",

            "content": "I saw this film at the cinema the same day as I saw Lost in Space (the new one, with Gary Oldman). By comparison, Lost in Space was high art full of deep metaphysical dilemmas. MK:A is terrible.I loved the Mortal Kombat games, and was pleased to see that MK The Movie was better than Street Fighter II The Movie. Sure, it was a light-on film, but it had some moments and I spent most of my time laughing at the unintentionally bad bits. MK:A makes MK The Movie look sophisticated.The first five minutes basically drops a piano on the head of the first movie - new bad guy, Johnny Cage dies, new heroes appear, minimal explanation. From then on you have a sub-standard martial arts film packed full of cheap costumes on cheap actors following a cliched script. I know there's not a lot of narrative you can squeeze out of a fighting computer game, but surely the writers could have tried a little harder to make something work. Having gone to the movie with a guy who didn't play the games, I had to explain what the hell was going on for the first half (like why is that guy fighting him?) and gave up after that.That said, this movie contains the most unintentionally hilarious moment I have ever seen on film. Towards the end of the movie, Raiden moves from having flowing straight white hair to a peroxided flat-top. There's a brief mention of Raiden getting a haircut, and that's it. It makes absolutely no sense, and thinking about it still makes me laugh.",

            "content": "I have been a big fan of MK since the beginning, although I must admit I lost interest in the game series after part III.Buying MK Deception this past Christmas renewed my interest in the series.This movie was crap and I can't believe I bought this mess.Good thing I found it for 9.99 at the used bin, so I wasn't out of much.I was expecting to see a REAL sequel to the first movie, which I found fairly entertaining.I thought the first film was very good and does the game upon which it is based some justice.Not the case with MKA.The first problem is that they tried to fuse too much of MK2 with MK3.Then, if you're going to replace a character with another actor (Christopher Lambert), then at least make sure the new actor does a batter job than the first. The first Raiden was a hard-ass, and you knew not to mess with him. The second Raiden was a wuss and every time we saw him he was going through a wall.Weak portrayals of major MK characters was another flaw.The actress who portrayed Sonya Blade was nowhere near as good as Bridgette Wilson (the first Sonya).Same could be said with Cage (Linden Ashby).What was the point of even having Ermac and Rain in the movie if they weren't going to be referred to? A very weak portrayal of Sindel, Kitana's mother and the actress who played her isn't fit to act in soap operas.Line example: Kitana: \"My mother is dead.\" Sindel: \"As will be her daughter!\" Gimmie a break!

That is undebatably true of Annihilation, but that was also true with the first Mortal Kombat movie, and that was a great movie.  The problem is the HUGE let down in the martial arts and special effects scenes.  MK had some terrific fight scenes, such as the brilliant Cage/Scorpion fight in the forest, the great Liu Kang/SubZero fight, and the cool finale with Shang Tsung.  Annihilation didn't have any fight scenes up to the quality of those three, many of the fight scenes made no sense, and the finale was horrible.  In addition, some things in Annihilation I would really like an explanation for:Why did Raiden dress up like Aladdin half way through the movie?  Was looking like a complete dork part of becoming mortal?  And where was Christopher Lambert, anyway?What was the third test?  Where did that Wolf-guy go?  What happened to Sub-Zero?Why did they do that stupid thing with Jax' bionic arms?  Stupid movies should admit they are stupid movies.  Stupid movies which try to have serious elemends become bad movies.Same deal with Katana's mother.What was point of that huge monster that came out of nowhere to attack Sonya, then immediately went back to it's whole when Jax hit it on the head? Was it a whack-a-mole?How is it that Sonya and Jade began to fight IN A DESERT and they immediately fell into a mud pit?Why did Smoke maticulously break every window in that random building before fighting Sonya and Jax?What was the point of having Liu Kang turn into a dragon?  He just turned into a human again, without having done anything effective as a dragon.  How was that useful?Why didn't they spend more then $80 on the special effects for that dragon?  I could do better then that with miniatures and clay animation.How is it that this movie could have been made so badly, with such bad cinematography and such pathetic martial arts effects, after the first one was so good?",

            "content": "I shan't start off by saying \"I used to be an MK fan\", because whenever I read those I want to fetch my violin and start playing. I enjoyed playing the games but was never \"that\" into them. Suffice to say I found the first Mortal Kombat, to be fairly entertaining. Mild stuff really, verging on \"almost could be cool if...\" A real four stars out of ten fiasco, but one that wouldn't offend.MKA however became a pastime for us at University, when we were in that frame of mind, to throw it on and laugh ourselves silly with the absolute shambles that is this film. It is tragic. Enough said. This film has nothing going for it. Everything has taken a step backwards.The special effects are woeful. Instead of three characters with mild in-depth studies, they jetisoned that for seven main characters, each with their own personal demons to overcome. Riveting. The script is what I have the most problem with. Pour example:1) A new Raiden. Lambert, gave the role some credibility in the original and was responsible for giving MK a moderate turn over. Inevitably he wasn't going to do a second. So inevitably they had to bring in someone else. The audience knows this. The actors know this. The writers know this. But please don't have the character you created know this. He's supposed to be the same person, so to have him say \"i've had a haircut rar rar\" is a tragic way of saying \"i know i'm not lambert so I did something different\". 2) Robin Shao...Oh Robin. Many nights have been wiled away laughing at his demise from ewokian heights. A tragic actor, only in for his mild kung-fu knowledge, on the premise he could \"act\". Carried in the first film by Lambert and the chap who played Shang Tsung (don't remember his name but he was in Rising Sun). In this one, he's supposed to hold it all together...and fails miserably. To be fair, again however he has no script with which to work. At one moment, before the \"final confrontation\", it is claimed Lui Kang is the only one left who can defeat Shao Khan. So your characters mantra is \"i want to do it, but i'm not ready\", and you layer over that with dialogue, meanings, symbolism, action etc etc...you don't have your character say those words!!! Talk about a mickey mouse operation. The writers obviously fed up at this point that their obvious talents were wasted on this low budget tripe, so just had the character say it, so they could invariably fit in more \"action\" sequences. 3) Far too many to go into. The fact that everything is figured out so matter of factly. Raiden figures out the \"prophecy\" (don't ask) was a lie. Surely not??? So to explain this travesty of events he claims \"they must of lied to me\". Bravo. Many nights burning the midnight oil for that one huh? It is all too, \"it is so because it is so\"The special effects truly are tragic. The only ones in the original were Sub Zero's Ice Blast, which in fairness was quite tastefully done if you are a hardcore fan. Scorpions \"get over here\", which is always a crowd favourite. Reptile, and Lui Kangs dragon punch (goro was Plasticine). But here they've wanted to go over the top with not nearly enough money. Sindels spinning to escape is woeful. Scorpions \"get over here\" is a pitiful remake (which also reminds me, Sub and Scorp are back, the two greatest characters ever, and yet they're midgets. About half the size from the original, looks as if they've been on three simultaneous atkins diets), and everything else is shambolic.The action skips from one scene to the next, but nothing grabs the eye. Raidens fight against three reptile is the closest thing to stylish or anyway near the premise of \"cool\". But it is still a long way away. To dispense with the formalities. This film sucks Donkey Balls...and yet I know so much about it...oh the pain..",

Then one day leader of the outer realm Shao Kahn (Brian Thompson) opens up a portal between the two realms and announces that he intends to merge the two realms in six days. With time ticking away, can Liu Kang and his crew stop Shao Kahn in time? I didn't care much for the first film, but curiosity got the better of me so I decided that I'd give the sequel a shot (really just to see if it's as bad as its rating suggests, and sadly it is).The first film had a storyline that was quite poorly developed, but it wasn't totally ridiculous. Here we basically have a 'world domination' storyline in place because the outer realm lost the battle with the Earth Realm. If you take away all the pretence then it boils down to the outer realm being sore losers. Playing this sequel as a straight forward revenge film would have been a better move.I'm probably giving this film too much credit by discussing the story because it seemed like the writers didn't care much for the story themselves. It seemed that any time there was an attempt at character interaction or plot development that we would have a ridiculous fight sequence coupled with the over-bearing soundtrack that we saw in the first film. The first film was directed MTV Style, but this film looks as though it was directed by someone on acid - the fight sequences were much more over the top, the editing was choppy and the choreography was laughable. It's almost like the director went for the bigger is better approach, but it just doesn't quite work here.The dialogue between the characters was laughable and painful. One of the worst examples of this is when Kahn is looking for a new general. This scene gives us some of the most cringe inducing exchanges of dialogue that I've ever heard. We're also handed some laughable plot twists, villains that are more cartoonish than anything else and don't even start me on the final fight scene between Liu Kang and Kahn sigh....The only thing that made this film very slightly tolerable was Jax. He provided the film with the occasional moment of comic relief, but this aspect alone is not enough to save this utter shambles. The only other minor positive that I took from watching this sequel is that it made me appreciate the first film more. Yes the first film was quite a bad film with a multitude of problems, but it was nowhere near as embarrassing or laughable as this sequel.",

Unfortunately the party is cut short when evil Outworld emperor Shao Kahn (Brian Thompson) & his generals, the four armed Sheeva (Marjean Holden), the half horse half man creature Motaro (Deron McBee) & Kitana's also not unattractive Mother Queen Sindel (Musetta Vander) appear & announce their plans for the destruction of the Earth as we know it. Shao Kahn has opened portals between the Outworld & Earth which will merge the two within 6 days & he will rule both unless our unlikely group of heroes can stop him & save the human race as well as themselves. With the odds seemingly stacked against them can they do it?Directed by John R. Leonetti Mortal Kombat: Annihilation is the sequel to the decent Mortal Kombat (1995) & both were based on the popular video game series of the same name which I can vividly remember playing with my mate on my Super Nintendo during the mid 90's, it was one of those games that you could have great fun with & one which we always went back to. Anyway, the script by Brent V. Friedman & Bryce Zabel takes just about all the character's up-to Mortal Kombat III which what the video game series was at when this came out & sticks them in one long fight sequence, to be perfectly honest there isn't a story really & any semblance of plot that is buried in here merely sets up the next fight or is there to introduce another character from the game. Sometimes you can just sit back & enjoy a film for what it is & that's what I did with Mortal Kombat: Annihilation, for me it brought back good memories of years gone by, it moves like an absolute rocket & you never have time to catch a breath before the next fight/monster/explosion/favourite character or just some good looking lady in a tight fitting costume kicking ass, what more do you want? On the negative side the Mortal Kombat games caused controversy because of the on screen violence & bloodshed like Sub-Zero's fatality where he would rip his opponents head off & the spine would still be attached, unfortunately the filmmakers obviously had a teenage audience in mind & I just thought it was far too tame & the fights had no satisfying pay-offs, also Mortal Kombat: Annihilation is probably the most far removed from reality film I've ever seen & it's just incredibly silly so anyone looking for something meaningful would probably be wise to skip this.Director Leonetti does a good job, the sets are cool with some nice colour schemes, the action is shot nicely by which I mean the camera doesn't jump cut every millisecond like a lot of films these days, this has the added bonus of us, the viewer that is, actually being able to see whats going on & keeping track of where everyone is & what their doing. The fights are very well choreographed & a lot of special moves from the games are here although I must again bring to your attention the general lack of ferocity & violence, it's just so tame & I don't remember seeing a single drop of blood during the entire film. Some of the CGI is absolutely terrible, some of the monsters are embarrassing to look at. The costumes are neat although I think the women could have worn a bit more leather if you know what I mean.With a supposed budget of about $30,000,000 it's well made, bad CGI apart, & you get plenty of fights & action for your money. Surprised to learn a fair amount of it was shot in England as well as Wales, Jordan & Thailand. The less said about the acting the better. There are some nice looking ladies here & a special mention goes to Talisa Soto whom is very easy on the eyes.Mortal Kombat: Annihilation is one of those films that I liked a lot but I'm positive that many will hate, I don't really care though as films are all about personal opinion & I liked Mortal Kombat: Annihilation, it ain't going to win any awards but for non-stop action, fights & mindless fun I doubt there's much better out there. I just wish the filmmakers had some balls & made it more violent & stick some gory fatalities in there. Oh well, nothings perfect I suppose... I liked it but I'm sure many won't, the choice is yours. Followed by the TV series Mortal Kombat: Conquest (1998 - 1999) & a third film titled Mortal Kombat: Devastation (2007) is listed on the IMDb as being 'Announced'.",

Sheeva died without a fight, Nightwolf came in just to hit an axe on Liu Kang, Jade was JUST A TRAITOR.Shao Kahn's acting was the worst.

            "content": "May contain minor spoilers (like it matters for this flick, LOL)Okay, now this is a case of supreme irony. In \"Mortal Kombat\" you had a series of fighting games that, unlike most games of that genre, actually had interesting characters with somewhat interesting back-stories (admittedly things got pretty stupid by MK 4, but that's another review ...). It's amazing that this piece of childish, Saturday-morning-cartoon, plotless nonsense could come out of that. I mean, after all, look at the first movie; it wasn't so bad. Not GOOD, but not BAD either. They utterly ignored the Scorpion/Sub-Zero feud, they killed Kano off far too early, the last scene was totally out of place, and the Goro effects were awful, but other than that it was okay.But MKA is an insult to every long-standing fan of the games. Hey, Hollywood movie-makers, take note: gamers are not ALL illiterate, bloodthirsty, sex-crazed teens who are so stupid they'll love anything with loud noises, people fighting, chicks in tight clothes, and lots of pretty colors.MKA loosely follows the back-story of the third MK game, which saw Outworld emperor Shao Kahn take over Earth by using a cosmic loophole to re-incarnate his queen, Sindel. Not Oscar-winning stuff for sure, but it could have been done with SOME class and style. And it wasn't. What we got was a little bald Shao Kahn about as menacing as Big Bird, a bunch of insipid crap that had NOTHING to do with the games (\"family crest\" tattoos, anyone?), and not even a halfway serious attempt at creating a plot or story.This isn't so much a movie as it is a long strung-together series of arcade game matches played out by actors OTHER than the ones who were digitized into the actual games. Scorpion appears, then Sub Zero. Subby beats Ol' Yellow Drawers off, hastily explains that he is the younger brother of the original Sub Zero, does some freezing tricks, and then we see no more of him; it's on to the next match. And on we go ... Characters are trotted in; a pathetic, completely un-exciting fight ensues; one character is promptly killed or removed in some way; Repeat step 1. Play MK Trilogy for two hours straight sometime; it's not only the exact same experience as MKA - it's BETTER.And it gets worse. It really does. I don't know how, but it does. Which brings me to the \"Animalities.\" Most fans I've talked to agree (and so do I) that this was one of the lamest things ever introduced in the games, and lo and behold the filmmakers fell on it and INCLUDED it in the movie, making for some incredibly cheesy and badly animated monster battles. Liu Kang and Shao Kahn turning into Godzilla-style creatures? Come on. The mud wrestling match between Sonya and Mileena was better than that. And THAT was pretty pathetic, too.Other wonderful features of the film include Sonya's miraculous ability to become squeaky-clean - complete with a lush mane of blow-dried hair - after suffering that mudbath. And while the \"filmmakers\" (I use the term loosely) mindlessly crammed in small story tidbits from the game with no attempt to make a story out of them, they studiously ignored Kabal and Stryker - both of whom would have made for some GREAT material - by having somebody casually mention that they'd both been captured. Then its back to the mindless series of matches.And to those of you who may say \"chill out, it's not meant to be taken seriously,\" I say this: even though that may be true, you should still expect a certain level of intelligence in plot and story. This movie has not one shred of anything even approaching intelligent writing. Look at how good the X-Men flick was - who'd have thought a story about a bunch of comic-book mutants could be pulled off so well? MKA could've been as good, and it bugs me that it wasn't. I live in fear of the next MK movie...",

Perhaps the worst thing is the fight at the end with the two really bad CG \"animalities\", a cheesy idea from the game that should have stayed in the game.

            "content": "I must admit that I quite enjoyed the first film.  Not the best martial arts flick in the world, but by no means the worst.  However, compared to this, its a damn masterpiece!1)  There are WAAAAAY too many characters.  In the first, you had the four heroes (Cage, Sonya, Kang, and Raiden), and about five villains (Kahn, Kano, Sub-zero, Scorpion, and Goro).  This meant that at least some amount of time could be spent building on characters.  Thus, before we see Sub zero,Goro and scorpion fight, we know who they are , and their reputations.  This doesnt happen with a single character in MK:A because it is too busy trying to throw as many characters from the games at you as possible that it often doesnt even have time to mention who they are (e.g. Smoke, Cyrax, Rain, Baraka, Mileena).2)  It's had a $30 million budget, yet seems to have spent on completely the wrong things.  I would have much rather they had halved their SFX budget and hired a decent fight choreographer.  Put it this way: Iron Monkey cost less than $4 (if I remember correctly) for the entire film, and there isnt a single fight in MK:A that comes close to the worst in that film, which leads on to the next point.3) The direction is TERRIBLE!!  Especially during the fights!!!  Watch any decent fight sequence, and generally the cuts are kept to a minimum.  It both makes the fight easier to follow, and shows off the skill of the participants more. Its rare in this film that any flow between moves occurs without cuts.  During one move, there are actually about five cuts!!  No cuts would have looked much better!!4) Its hard to decide which is worse, the script, or the acting.5) The SFX heavy final battle is perhaps the lamest thing I have ever seen.There are people who will defend this film saying that \"its just fun!\", or \"Its not meant to be deep and meaningful or anything\".  Which works for some films.  And those films can be fun.  Or not deep and meaningful, but still enjoyable.  This isnt.  Its bad.  It hasnt got one redeeming feature that I can think of.  Possibly the worst film.  Ever.",

It only takes one bad movie to lose a large following. This movie should have never been made or at least have better writers better acting(Lu and Katina were good) the rest were half rate actors.

I was a big fan of Mortal Kombat video game when i was a kid, especially MK3 and its charachters like Noob Saibot, Smoke, Ermac. I have watched Mortal Kombat movie few times, it was never a good flick but it was a solid homage to original video game. Years have passed and somehow i have never watched this one, i had a feeling that it is really bad and i was right, but still after 20 and more years i wanted to see it myself. Recently i had a marathon of watching bad movies only, i really enjoy some campy and cheese movie for brainless fun, mostly from the 80s, and Annihaliton found its place on that list. And i am sad that i gave it opportunity, this was utterly bad experience from start to finish. The direction is awful, fights are short and stupid, acting is beyond any level and CGI is the worst i have ever seen in any movie. Some mentioned that the only good part is Shao Khan played by Brian Thompson, but his acting is ridicilous like everything in this movie. There are too many charachters in this sequel and i think the main goal of this movie was to intorduce all the characters from the game to better sell it in the market. This movie is utter disaster and i dont recommend even to the fans of Mortal Kombat franchise. Stay further away from this one, only if you want to annihilate your own brain cells watched it but be careful, mortal kombat for your brain awaits you.",

            "content": "The good guys, led by Rayden (Remar), have to fight the bad guys, led by Shao Khan (Thompson) before the \"merger\" of Earth with the baddie lair of The Outworld. That's it. We're not being lazy. That's really it.Here's a question the filmmakers behind Mortal Kombat: Annihilation must have asked themselves: How do we fashion a 90-minute movie not just out of a beat-em-up video game (because we already did that once before) - but do it again with a sequel? It seems like the answer they came up with was just to feature as many Mortal Kombat characters as they could, and simply by them being there, that would satisfy young people who were already fans of the franchise or simply didn't know any better.It does seem that the priority here was being true to the game. Maybe they worried that if they didn't include at least brief appearances by all the countless characters that existed by the time Mortal Kombat 3 rolled around, all the 12-year-olds in the audience would revolt or something. So then they just threw a bunch of childish dialogue, plot points, and CGI/green screen silliness at the screen and hoped for the best.There are non-stop fights, as you might expect, but it feels like a video game, not so much a movie. It seems like the priority with the casting was to find people who physically resembled the game characters, and then fit them in costumes that followed suit. As our friend Brendan pointed out, it seems like this movie was made by someone who had never made or even seen a movie before, but had existed solely on a diet of video games their whole life.After getting off to a rocky start, the movie struggles to find its feet, and by the time that happens, you find that the whole outing is just too silly and nonsensical to really hate.\nOf course, that hasn't stopped anyone from adding this movie to lists of the worst of all time. Fan favorite actors such as Brian Thompson, Malibu, Robin Shou, and James Remar (who even does some brief Remar-Fu) manage to keep some level of interest, and there does seem to be a kid-friendly message of \"believe in yourself!\" but the whole outing is very, very ridiculous and is the type of overblown, unnecessary, computer-generated crud that could only have come from the Hollywood system. It seems that that's all they're good for making these days. So, in that sense, Mortal Kombat: Annihilation was ahead of its time.Featuring all your favorite techno hits on the soundtrack, it's hard to imagine exactly who this movie was aimed towards: if you're a fan of the game series, you're bound to be disappointed, and if you're not, and for some reason you just jumped in cold to the movie, you're bound to be confused and irritated. So, for that reason, it must be \"the children\" that was the target market. So if, in 1997, they could get their eyes off of Power Rangers or BeetleBorgs for a few minutes, they could watch this.\nFor everyone else, it might be wise to steer clear. Let's face it, you don't go out of your way to watch Mortal Kombat: Annihilation because you're looking for a Eugene O'Neill-level of drama. You do it to experience the continuing exploits of Ermac.",

As said before, Raiden goes from the Thunder God to a weeping coward. The new Liu Kang is nowhere near as good as the one in the original movie. Not to mention the fact that half of the new actors, such as the actor who portrayed Shao Kahn, were nowhere near good enough to play a character in a franchise such as Mortal Kombat.Another problem I had with this movie is its inconsistency with the game. For instance, it is \"revealed\" that Raiden and Shao Kahn are brothers, and Shinnok is their father.There is also the issue that the movie seemed a bit rushed. The reason it was rushed, as I can see, is to cram as many characters as possible into the movie, to properly \"represnt\" the game. Ermac served no purpose, nor did Rain. Ermac is one of my favorite characters in the game, and to see him in the movie as a 2 minute segment which ends with him being quickly killed off does not satisfy me.I would give this movie a 3 out of 10, simply because, although it was lackluster, was based on Mortal Kombat, and I will grant it something for that.",

It's the continuation of the 1995 video game adaptation. In the first \"Mortal Kombat\" instalment, Lord Rayden has appointed three experienced fighters to challenge against the forces of evil. There's the skilled and disciplined Liu Kang, the beautiful, but dangerous SWAT team leader Lt. Sonya Blade and the arrogant but lethal action film star Johnny Cage. These three heroes in defense of planet Earth compete in high profile tournament against competitors from other dimensions. Princess Kitana (Talisa Soto) proved to be worthwhile alliance in helping Rayden's fighters emerge victorious. In the follow-up our fierce heroes are in another perilous situation. Evil Outworld Empire Shao Khan has plotted an initiative to destroy Lord Rayden and his comrades once and for all and to take over the Earth along with another merging dimension. Khan succeeds in destroying Cage, kidnaps Kitana and establishes a death trap for the good guys and plots his worldly takeover accompanied by rocket-propelled ninjas, a zombie-like queen, a monster that resembles a centaur, scorpion manifestations, an army of skilled martial artists and a deadly sibling duo. With Cage out of the equation, Lt. Blade recruits SWAT member Jax and that's when the #$%$-kicking begins. Will good conquer evil? Surely the mature adult demographics will easily dismiss this silly nonsensical action film, but I have news for you adults. This movie is not for adults. It's custom made for adolescents and action junkies to enjoy. If you liked the first \"Mortal Kombat\" movie with it's rapid-paced high-flying action from the male and female leads, then this movie provides the same adrenaline here. For those who are into the technical features well it's pure eye-candy to say the least. The special-effects are remarkable, the fighting scenarios are vibrant and colourful and and the fight-scenes are brilliantly exhibited. The technical aspects a re triumphant due largely to director John Leonetti who was the cinematographer in the last \"Mortal Kombat\" movie. The fighting scenes provides a cornucopia of different styles of martial arts kicks and even the CGI characters display some impressive moves too. It's like a Battle of the Titans pitting American action hero fighting against the Hong Kong style of wushu. The production values worked out quite nicely thank mainly to \"Terminator 2\" producer Lawrence Kasanoff.Robin Shou who starred in the other \"Mortal Kombat\" movie, has come a long way. From his humble childhood in Hong Kong to migrate in the City of Angels and earned his degree in civil engineering at CSU in Los Angeles. Only to move back to Hong Kong to don his skills as a stuntman and would later show his acting chops by playing villains. Nine years later, he returns to California to attend a friend's BBQ where an agent suggested that he audition for the part of Liu Kang and to showcase his wushu fighting style which is juxtapose of martial arts and cinematic presentation. Shou was so excited he sold his car and skipped the country to China to study the art of wushu.",

While you might have a very hard time thinking of any good ones, horrible films like \"Super Mario Brothers\" and \"Mortal Kombat: Annihilation\" quickly come to mind. Why? Well, because videogames don't need to be deep, have much plot or even make sense if the game play is good. Here, however, as a passive observer, all the lack of substance in the game plots are obvious as you sit and watch the silliness. Think about it....this is based on a game whose only plot is people punch and kill each other!I ahve not seen the first \"Mortal Kombat\" and the only reason I saw this one is that it's on IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 list...the lowest rated 100 films which have received at least 10,000 votes. This means independent and almost forgotten films aren't on the list...just the bigger named, widely distributed crappy movies.From what I gathered, humans winning the first movie guaranteed that the Earth would be safe for like 100 or a bazillion years. However, here, the baddies from another world are back only two years later. So much for continuity. In the initial portion of the movie, they tried to explain this away to all the human characters, as they also realized the plot problem! That's clumsy.\nSo, the rest of the film consist of some human warriors somehow overcoming Shao Kahn's evil gang of fighters.So is this any good? Of course not...10,000+ voters aren't wrong in this case. But there are some good things about the film. For 1997, the special effects are very nice--which is important since the story is essentially ALL special effects and crazy costumes. Also, they captured the look of the game quite well. But, no the other hand, the film is simply one insane fight after another after another after another. Not much plot...and it all makes your brain very numb very quickly. In fact, after about 20 minutes of this, my brain was screaming for a break! Overall, a pretty dull film despite its almost constant action and nutty fight scenes. I simply didn't care about any of these characters and just wanted it all to stop! My verdict...just go play a videogame yourself...you're bound to have more fun.",

Liu Kang and Kitana head off to find Nightwolf while Raiden and Sonya go to get Jax.Liu and Kitana are confronted by Smoke and some of Shoa Kahn's men but they defeat them and meet Sub-Zero who explain's that Liu Kang killed his older brother in Mortal Kombat. Sub-Zero then battles Scorpion but Scorpion soon takes Kitana and teleports off to Outworld.Meanwhile Sonya meets with Jax who has now upgraded himself with the metal arms and suddenly Cyrax and a group of Ninja's attack them and while Sonya fights the Ninja's Jax battle's Cyrax.Liu Kang meets Nightwolf who teaches him the power to change into his animal form, Liu wakes in the cold mountains and finds Jade who tries to seduce him but then fights him, after knocking her to the ground she tells him that this was a test and she is going to help him.Soon they go into Outworld and while Liu Kang goes to save Kitana Raiden now mortal fights Reptile, Liu saves Kitana from Baraka and meets with them again and finds that they have beaten Queen Sindel. Sindel escapes with Jade who shows that she is working for Shoa Kahn.Raiden then explains to them that he is Shoa Kahn's brother and could not kill him in battle years ago, they go off to Shoa Kahn's castle where Jax fights Motaro, Sonya fights Ermac and Noob Sabot, Kitana fights her mother Queen Sindel and Liu Kang fights Shoa Kahn.Defeating they're opponents they return to Earthrealm and Outworld is no longer merging with their realm. Queen Sindel is then good and is happy to meet her daughter again and Raiden is given the status of Elder god and will watch over Earthrealm.Although not as good as the first Mortal Kombat: Annihilation does have some nice fight scenes and a decent plot.

Well, I know that first movie was technically better: better sets, better production, better music etc. Better fight scenes? Not really. But it was little bit too slow and ambient in my opinion. Mortal Kombat 2 is a real roller coaster. Fast and, yes it's unpredictable in some ways. Everybody say - CGI is bad. Yes, it is. But practical effects are good. Some sets are very beautiful. The rythm of fight scenes is on top with original Kang vs Reptile battle. Brian Thompson as Shao Kahn is kind of funny, but there is something about humorous Shao Kahn)) New Sonya looks like a legit fighter to me. New Raiden is miscast. James Remar is fantastic as always, but it's not Raiden. I don't mind. I was video games fan in the 90s, and I know what pain is. No movie based on video games was \"right\" then. Street fighter, Mario Brothers, MK - all good movies, but not right in terms of video game lore. Anyway, Mortal Kombat Annihilation was interesting and bold project that wasn't quite right.

            "content": "Ed Boon, one of the creators of the Mortal Kombat video game, calls this the \"worst moment\" in the history of the franchise. Coming from someone who loved the original film and has played every one of the games, I agree.Christopher Lambert was seen as one of the highlights of the last film. He's gone, replaced by James Remar (The Warriors). I always dislike whitewashing in movies, but Lambert was so game in his scenes and such an integral part of getting the last film made (Lambert's great attitude calmed director Paul W. S. Anderson as he worked on his first big movie. While the highest salary in the film, he paid his own way to go to Thailand and do all of his own scenes for basically free there, just to ensure the movie looked better. Plus, he paid for the wrap party.).In fact, only Liu Kang (Robin Shou) and Kitana (Talisa Soto) are played by the same actors from the previous film. Robin Cooke, who played Reptile, plays Sub Zero here, with that fighter gaining a much larger role.Did you like Johnny Cage last time? Lots of people did. Bad news - he's killed seconds into this new film to get over new bad guy Shao Khan. He's opened a portal from Outrealm to Earth (hey wait - didn't we just fight a tournament to stop that from happening?) and has brought back his queen (and Kitana's mother) Sindel back from the dead.Sonya Blade (now played by Sandra Hess, who played the cave girl in Encino Man) brings in her partner Jax and they immediately battle Cyrax and Mileena. Then there's Nightwolf (played by Litefoot, the Native American who also portrayed Little Bear in The Indian in the Cupboard), a shaman who will guide Liu Kang and Kitana toward defeating Shao Khan. Another fight against Smoke and Scorpion, with the help of Sub Zero, happens and Kitana gets kidnapped.Raiden meets with the Edger Gods, who don't really give any answers. I have several questions for them. Like, why are we fighting Shao Khan when we won a tournament to stop things like this from happening? And why is there a fight every ten seconds instead of character development like the first film? Or why didn't you bring back the actors we liked in these roles? And why doesn't the \"Toasty!\" guy show up?Nightwolf makes Liu Kang pass several trials to gain the power of Animality, which allows him to shapeshift into a new form. He must pass the self-esteem and focus trial. The trial of temptation, where Jade tries to get in his karate pants. And there's a third test, but we never get to it! One assumes that he passes it, as we'll see in the finale.Raiden gives up his immortality to fight for Earth, which means that he needs to cut off his hair. Jade is a double agent and while the good guys rescue Kitana, they still face tough odds. Raiden reveals that Shao Khan is his brother and their father, Shinook, is favoring his evil sibling. After a big battle, Raiden is killed at the hands of that very same brother.Another lengthy fight sequence happens, with Motaro, Ermac, Sindel and even Noob Saibot all showing up.Liu Kang then shows what an Animality is by turning into a poorly rendered dragon in a scene that makes this movie seem more dated than the 1995 original. Luckily, the Elder Gods discover the shenanigans afoot and declare another round of Mortal Kombat.Aren't you glad we have Liu Kang on our side? He defeats Shao Kahn and allows Raiden to return as the Earth realm wins again.Director John R. Leonetti would go on to be the cinematographer for The Scorpion King, I Know Who Killed Me, The Conjuring and The Insidious series before directing Annabelle and Wish Upon. He's done great work in those films, but this film feels so much cheaper than the original. It's weird, because that film succeeded because it transcended it's junk food origins while the sequel just piles way too much on.Original directed Paul W.S. Anderson decided to do Event Horizon instead of this film. He hated the results and that's why he's stayed close to the Resident Evil franchise throughout its sequels.It's hard to hate a movie where alien monsters battle ninjas, so if you accept this one as goofy chop socky fun, it's fine. But when compared to the original - and with the rich mythology of the Mortal Kombat video games at its fingertips - this one really suffers. There have been rumors of a franchise reboot for years, including two online series. Here's hoping the next one recaptures the first film's magic.",

Two things that made me give this movie an 8 rating: 1) Would have love to see Chris Lambert reprise his role of Rayden instead of this other guy.2) Lame CGI when it came to the Animality scene toward the end, would have worked better with showing somewhat real animals.Other than that, this movie is OK in my book.8/10 stars.",

Of course they did appear only for a couple of minutes but still it was worth seeing them in this. In this movie Liu Kang has to fight Shao Khan Raiden's brother in order to save the world and all other realms. With the help of Sonya, Jax, Katana and Raiden they defeat Shao Khan and the world is saved. As for Raiden he becomes one of the Elder Gods.

It is without a doubt the worst movie for Video Game Month and the worst movie I have ever seen based on a video game. I'm just perplexed at how awful it is. I feel like I could write books about it, so I'll try to keep this rant short. This film begins by showing that most of the actors have been replaced. The last movie clearly sets up a sequel. How could the actors have not known there would be one? Johnny Cage dies in the first ten minutes. Are you seriously saying they couldn't get Johnny Cage's actor back to have him on screen for mere minutes? The special effects in this film are absolutely unwatchable and it's probably the worst CGI I have ever seen in my entire life. I'm going crazy watching the final scene where Shao Khan and Liu Kang turn into animals and it looks absolutely horrendous. We get appearances by nearly every single character in the \"Mortal Kombat\" franchise (up to this point at least). Remember how I said \"Street Fighter\" suffered from having too many characters? This is that even worse. None of them have purpose. They're just nobodies. We saw Scorpion die in the last movie. Here he comes back with no explanation. In the games, he was immortal, but why didn't they mention that here? Why isn't anyone surprised someone who died has returned with no explanation? Jaxx is probably the most obnoxious character as he spouts these corny one liners that make me miss Johnny Cage. Don't have him be another JC I worship! Raiden is killed in the final battle in one single hit. How weak is he? Where are all the other characters at the end of the movie? What happened to Sheeva? Was she just beaten offscreen because she disappears? The slow motion is nauseating and everybody looks so stupid jumping around. Why doesn't Shao Khan have his mask on? I didn't even know that was him when he first appeared without it.Why does Shao Khan's father turn into a cube? Why doesn't Shao Khan have that awesome voice from the games? How can an axe make someone hallucinate? What is going on in any of this idiotic movie? Why is Jaxx so stupid he takes off his armor in the last battle? The only and I mean the ONLY good thing was that they had some of the game's music, but even that wasn't used enough. I'm just shocked that anybody thought this was entertaining. The first movie wasn't good, but compared to this, it's \"Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie\". Half a star",

            "content": "MKA is a terrible movie by all means, but that doesn't stop me from enjoying myself immensely. The 1st one remains a favorite of mine, but even that movie is no masterpiece itself, but this right here is the epitome of cheesy. Bridgette Wilson is gone, Linden Ashby is gone, Christopher Lambert is gone, all because of the rotten script it had. It's very Video Gameish looking, with laughably cheesy effects, but it did deliver constant noisy action that pleased me. I think the filmmakers knew they had a crappy movie on their hands, but they did there best to inject it with solid fight sequences, even if they were totally cheesy. My main complaint with this movie was they made Shao Kahn to be a weakling of sorts. He alternated between menacing and cowardly, and it was way too inconsistent for my liking. The ending also felt too easy as well. I felt triumph and happiness after the original was over, here I felt rather cheated and a bit unsatisfied. Complaints aside, I enjoyed this movie for what it is, and that's a campy pleasure.The Characters.Robin Shou-Liu Kang. He is nowhere near as strong as the lead he was in the 1st, but that's because of the poor script and the dialog he had to utter. His charisma got him through it, and to me he will always be Liu Kang. That Dragon effect at the end was utterly awful though.Talisa Soto-Kitana. She wasn't anything near a revelation in the 1st, but she served her purpose well, while being great eye-candy. Here she just felt their, and I didn't sense any depth or effort into her character. The fan blades were a nice touch though.James Remar-Rayden. He's no Lambert, and the dialog he had was very crummy, but he added his own brand of style to Rayden, and for the most part I dug it. Hated the cheap haircut though.Sandra Hess-Sonya Blade. She is way to bland for her own good. She doesn't possess the presence or the charisma of Bridgette what so ever.Lynn 'Red' Williams-Jax. I got a kick out of him, and he obviously was enjoying himself. He had charisma to spare and was Jax to me. One of the few smart casting choices. They even gave him the bionic arm.Brian Thompson-Shao-Kahn. He felt a little to cheesy for my liking, and wasn't the Kahn I knew from the video games. He tried his best, but it wasn't all his fault. It was more the way the character was written. The flying shoulder block or whatever you call it looked somewhat cool though.Reiner Sch\u00f6ne-Shinnok. He did well in the part, but I'd like to have known more about the character.Musetta Vander-Sindel. Her makeup looked silly, and she overdid it with the laugh, but she did well for the most part.Irina Pantaeva-Jade. She felt rather wooden and cheesy to me, but looked the part.Deron McBee-Motaro and Marjean Holden-Sheeva do well in their parts.Litefoot-Nightwolf. Perfect casting choice here, even if he only had one scene. Chris Conrad-Johnny Cage. Died well, I can say that.John Medlen-Ermac and J.J. Perry-Cyrax and Scorpion. Do well in there limited parts. Scorpion is not a focal point in this movie.Dana Hee-Milena. Didn't do much in her part, she looked good though.Ridley Tsui-Smoke. Made a brief appearance.Keith Cooke-Sub-Zero. Showed up without a mask, but it's not the same one, it was his brother.Dennis Keiffer-Baraka. Amusingly enough. Sly Stallone was wanted for this part. He showed up briefly.Tyrone C. Wiggins-Rain. Too brief.Bottom line. I enjoy it for what it is, and that's a guilty pleasure. It really is a terrible movie, but one I enjoy. If only they didn't cram so many characters with little to do, it could have been a competent film. Kombat fans will likely hate it, others may see it like I do.6/10",

The first film was OK but this one has come out of right field, blown away the competition, blown the game wide open! I'm a huge fan of the computing game series which this is based on and I was delighted to discover that all my favourite fighters were installed. The first game only had 6 characters and the film only had 4 of these. Here there is a mammoth roster of 86 to play with and watch. I wish this film was a game and I could have picked up my joystick and started throwing some fireballs, hellokens, and babyalities. I wish I could jump into the TV and help Lou, Jimmy,Kong, Rayman and co defeat the Dark Lord Can. I would have defeated them all and then claimed Sonia as my wife. If she didn't like that then whack! I would turn into a dragon and eat her. Fatality! I dreamt once that I married Sonia, but she turned into Sonia from Eastenders. I started crying and the Dr recommended I take some time off work.Me and my wee brother Andy used to pretend we were our favourite characters and fight. I would always be Lou Kang or Scorpio, while Andy preferred being Chun Lee. We made up our own speciality moves. I would hold my smaller leg for 4 seconds before releasing which enabled me to fly across the room in mid air like a rowing machine. Once I put a skipping rope up my sleeve and pretended it was Scorpio's 'Come Hither!' weapon. I would thrust my arm at lightening speed and out would fly the end of the skipping rope, crushing everything in its path, including my Mum's favourite vase. No amount of special powers and blocking moves could stop my mum from a flawless victory. She unleashed some forbidden moves on me with a fury I had never before witnessed as if she was using turbo buttons. I tried fighting back with some back sweeps and apologies but she continued with blinding speed and screams. I was sent to my room and mum threw out my games. She said I was too young to be playing such games and said I could play them when I was older. Looking back I was only 21 and she was probably right. Another time that chump Brendan came round saying he had a game called Rise Of The Robots and that it could kick Mortal Kombat's ass. I wasn't going to take such nonsense so I declared a battle to decide, him fighting as his game and me as mine me. We started throwing slurs at each other after school, at the local quarry. A group of onlookers heard about it and came to watch. This would be the defining battle of our generation and the future would be ruled by the winner. Brendan because he is a fool started yapping at me. Thus follows our conversation: Ha ha! Soon your visage will be labelled black and blue by my limbs of glory! Your insolence knows no boundaries. If I was a bigger man I would kick babies, but, however, I, am the biggest man! All your face is belong to us.And then too, your wife!Silence forever, big silly! Not ever or never, ya rapscallion! You may think you are the Number 1, but today I am in the pink. Then challenging today is a good and will winner be one of either me or opponent.Let's go then. Let's go for a fight timeI suck your pathetic action and will blow it back with more for you to deal!Your feet of steel will crumble against my groin of felicityDo not give me a fluster!Sailboat green onion sag onion sagIn this the Seventh month of our 14th year will be your last!Think about my tough. I will only utilise 41.7%This continued several more minutes before someone screamed fight, and I unleashed my secret skipping rope attack. There were gasps of surprise at this, but unfortunately it landed four feet from Brendan. He ran at me and attempted a fly kick but I was quicker and got a good stiff boot to his shin. He landed with a yelp and I followed up with 2 swift ankle blows. I knew I was winning and started to dance on my toes like Bruce. Brendan gave his patented projectile move (a thrown stone) which collided with my face and stunned me. He thought that had finished me off, but it only gave me my patented psycho mode in which I am faster, stronger, and invincible for 2 minutes. What happened next is a blur but onlookers tell me they had nightmares for weeks after. All I remember is as I pummelled him he kept screaming 'Get Me Escape!' but I didn't. Suffice to say, Brendan was a bloody, half-naked mess by the end of it and I was triumphant. Mortal Kombat wins!The plot follows Shadow Kan's revenge after his wizard was defeated in the previous film. He sends his armies to earth to kill all the best warriors. The goodies gang together and fight back.

            "content": "Simply put it this way, Mortal Kombat: Annihilation follows the videogames better than the first film did. Here are the reasons why: The first film just didn't seem like Mortal Kombat, even though it was a good film, but Mortal Kombat: Annihilation seems to surpass it in the action, and depiction. Annihilation follows the games a lot more, because they feature more characters that are from the games, more moves that are from the game, and definitely the characters of Scorpion and Sub-Zero have better suits, but I suppose that they had crap suits in the first one because they had bad suits in the first game, I don't know. The first film Sub-Zero's ice ball, or freeze maneuver, was over exaggerated a lot. In the games, it does not take that long for him to produce an ice ball. In Annihilation, he just does it like in the game. Sonya, in here uses her trademark move, the \"kiss of death\", but in this installment, it has a different effect than in the games. The choreography was also very good, I thought so. Lots of people say that the fight scenes were overhauled by cheesiness, but I really don't understand why they say that. The acting is definitely what you would expect in these types of films, good, and imperfect. Sometimes the acting would be overhauled by the cheesy screenplay. The scene where Sub-Zero first makes an appearance is a good example. Sub-Zero says some crap to Liu Kang, I forgot what, something like, \"You killed my brother in the first tournament, and now you will have to fight again\", something like that, I forgot. The screenplay can only be cheesy sometimes, but its not all that bad. Another example of a cheesy screenplay, is Scorpion uttering out the word \"Suckers!\" instead of \"Get over here!\". Like I said, the acting isn't bad, its just what you would expect in a typical action/adventure flick. The story seems to remain the same, just with new characters, and new threat, but overall, I don't give a crap about the story. Character costumes, like I mentioned earlier, are very good, but that only applies to characters that have the same ninja outfit as Scorpion and Sub-Zero, because characters like Cyrax, and Smoke, look terrible. It was clear that their chest protectors were made out of plastic, and their masks look terrible as well. I basically described the entire movie, so I'll tell you the things that I really didn't like about the film. Her it goes: They took out Bridgett Wilson, she was hotter than the other girls who played as Sonya. They took out Christopher Lambert, and replaced him with this weird guy, and to top it off, they give Raiden a damn flat-top! Overall, I felt that Annihilation was better than the previous film, because it had the real Mortal Kombat persona. 9 out of 10.",

I mean video games had better visuals then this film has all together.As a fan of the first Mortal Kombat movie I will say yes that film wasn't perfect but it had at least try to make itself a hit and it was. I consider the first Mortal Kombat to have been done right. Mortal Kombat: Annihilation does not. The acting in the film is simply awful the cast seem that they were trying to make a bad video game and also the writing in the film is just plain bad. Also the story is really weak. Perhaps the best thing about the film is that if you don't watch it you'll be better off because this film really don't do anything to award the viewerI give Mortal Kombat: Annihilation an 2 out of 10",

            "content": "One thing all 90's kids can agree on is that 1995 brought us one of the most kick-butt movies of the decade with the release of the movie adaptation of \"Mortal Kombat\"- based of course on the popular arcade games of the same name.It was a huge hit, coming out at the perfect time to thrill audiences in a market that hadn't yet suffered martial arts and CGI overload. It boasted a fun storyline with mayhem and magic, had that amazing techno-song, was populated with likable actors and was filled to burst with tons of awesome moments. Who doesn't remember the hilarious intro to Johnny Cage, or the amazing puppetry on Goro, or the sweet Liu Kang VS Sub-Zero match?With the game series ever-growing and expanding the mythology and the first film being such a pleasant surprise, we just knew that the inevitable sequel was gonna be bigger and better! There's no way it couldn't!...right?Then reality slapped us in the face with 1997's \"Mortal Kombat: Annihilation.\" A film that has gone on to join the ranks of \"Batman & Robin\" and \"Speed 2\" as one of the most infamous sequels of not only the 90's, but arguably of all time. A failure that squanders all potential and destroys virtually all left-over good-will from the first movie and instead replaces it with laughable writing, strangely over-the-top performances, bizarrely dated effects even at the time and mind- blowingly bad visual direction.Picking up immediately after the original ends, the evil emperor Shao Kahn opens a portal from Outworld and begins a process that will merge it with the Earth in six-days time, giving him total power. Now, our Earth-heroes Liu Kang, Sonya Blade, Jax and Raiden must find a way to stop this devious scheme or else the Earth will be lost forever.That may sound like a solid enough foundation to build a movie off of, but trust me... it doesn't work. The film is beyond fractured and frankly every single scene just lumps on more plot-holes, unanswered questions and contrived pseudo-explanations in order to justify the proceedings... mainly so it can tenuously connect the constant onslaught of bad fight scenes that make up a majority of the screen time.Director John R. Leonetti seems in over his head with this film- his directorial debut, taking over for original director Paul WS Anderson. Leonetti and his army of screenwriters are never able to find any real sort-of balance with tone, pace or style. Scenes come and go are strange intervals, humor and drama never quite gel together, and sub-plots and characters are constantly jarringly introduced and dropped without consequence or reason. The visuals are also a marked step- down from the original, with many shots being poorly thought- out and unable to be cut together competently.There's also the issue of padding and choreography in many of the fights that lends to it all feeling very dull and forced. While the first film's action does have a slight air of feeling \"fake\" in retrospect, it can be forgiven as it was one of the first truly hit martial-arts-based films in the US. But this one just ramps up that problem, with so many unneeded flips and tricks that are thrown in to be \"cool\" and \"the bomb\", that it just feels tacky and false. By the time you see the thirtieth random backflip, you'll feel like doing some flipping yourself... flipping the channel to something else.The performances are among some of the hammiest I've seen in a major blockbuster. The only person who really emerges unscathed is the criminally underrated Robin Shou returning to his role of Liu Kang. He's great. Everyone else? A caricature. Lynn \"Red\" Williams as Jax is a giant goofball who throws around unfunny one-liners like its nobody's business. Reiner Sch\u00f6ne chews the scenery as Kahn's evil father. Brian Thompson constantly SHOUTS his lines at RANDOM in an attempt to sound THREATENING as our lead villain. But of course Musetta Vander steals the show with her legendarily bad take on Princess Kitana's mother Sindel, spouting some of the worst dialog ever written with the glee of a 12-year-old on a sugar-high. It's outlandish watching her twirl and cackle and wave her arms about in her scenes... What did she think she was even doing? Was she trying to channel Ace Ventura for her role?Add to that... -Lowered production values (Gag-worthy green-screens and clearly rubber \"metal\" on the costumes and sets galore!) -Shoddy costume design that looks like the actors are dressed in the Wal-Mart Halloween costumes based on the movie rather than in real movie costumes-Wildly dated effects that looked bad even in 1997 (We're talking \"Tron\" quality CGI at times... except this was made 15 years later)...and more and you have a recipe for disaster.That being said, I do have to make a somewhat startling admission......I kinda like this movie. Oh, it's bad. It's really bad. But it's so bad, that it springs right back up as one of those unintentional \"so bad, it's kinda good\" camp classics. There's no way to hear lines of dialog like those you hear in this film (\"You're alive!\" \"...too bad YOU WILL DIE!\") without howling with laughter. There's no way to see the incompetent fight sequences where people are flipping through the air like helium-filled balloons without chuckling and shaking your head. There's no way to see the awful, 80's quality digital creatures flying about without a big-old smirk coming across your face.So, if you like so-bad-they're-good flicks... This is one for the ages!I give \"Mortal Kombat: Annihilation\" a 3 out of 10. It's an awful sequel that effectively killed a franchise. But with some friends and maybe some booze, you'll still have a grand time tearing it apart and laughing at its sheer ineptitude.",

            "content": "The Mortal Kombat franchise has become a massive hit among gamers around the world, despite the overwhelming controversy surrounding its portrayal of graphic violence. This sparked a film adaptation which was crafted in the hands of Paul W. S. Anderson. Although the original was far from reaching a classic status and fell short of its cinematic potential in terms of writing and visuals, there was at least some level of competence to be endured. This sequel on the other hand, is an abhorrent disaster. Stripping away from the proper ingredients of a competent fantasy epic, this film operates at an significantly low level of proficiency, a level that makes its predecessor look like an Oscar flick. Sustaining a hodgepodge of a thinly written plot, painfully inept visuals, and paper-thin characters, this film is a cinematic inert slog that slips into the cracks of unintentional comedy. Picking up where the last film left off, Shao Kahn (played by Brian Thompson), an evil emperor from a realm known as Outworld has invaded Earth and set it wipe out the human race with his sadistic extermination squad made up of characters only the fans of the video game would be familiar with. With the rules of the Mortal Kombat broken and the fate of humanity at stake, Liu Kang (played by Robin Shou), Sonya (played by Sandra Hess, replacing Bridgette Wilson), Raiden (played by James Remar), Kitana (played by Talisa Soto), and half-human, half-robot Jax (played by Lynn Red Williams) become the last line of defense against Shao Kahn's tyranny.The conductor behind this cinematic misfit is John R. Leonetti who replaces original director Paul W. S. Anderson who went to work on the science-fiction horror thriller 'Event Horizon'. If there is anything that Leonetti successfully accomplishes throughout this picture, it would be staying faithful to the source material. Everything else though, is a simply a disaster. While the story kicks off a passable premise, it is not long before the plot melts into a generic slog. The story advances at a brisk pace with multiple fight sequences punctuating at every turn. This would be account to some excitement if these sequences were actually fun, or even visually appealing. Unfortunately, the action is sloppily decorated with laughable CGI and poor blue/green screen effects that render them thrill-less. And like the original, they shed away from the M-rated graphic violence that the video game franchise is widely known for. The biggest eyesore comes in the final battle sequence in which Robin Shou's Liu Kang morphs into a giant dragon resembling an abysmal paper cutout of Godzilla. As for the acting department, very few of the cast turn in competent performances. With the character pitted with cheesy dialogue that is more likely to provoke unintentional chuckles than emotional impact, it is genuinely difficult to connect with these characters even when the fate of the universe at the stake, unless you have grown a fandom of them from playing the video games. Mortal Kombat: Annihilation is the epitome of a cinematic sequel gone wrong, and is one that should strongly be avoided, unless you are looking for something in the \"so bad it's good\" category. The film is horribly crafted in terms of narrative and visual compulsion. In a good of advice, you would probably making better use of your time by sticking with the original.",

But the Mortal Kombat rules are broken when the malicious emperor of the outworld, Shao Khan, plans to bring together his realm with that of the earth within seven days. If that happens, mankind shall no longer exist. So it's up to a couple of martial arts warriors led by the Lord Rayden to stop that from happening.My, my, my. Why did I waste such precious time on this? Even I'm confused. I guess that's one of lives many mysteries that cannot be explained. The first film, which was directed by Paul W.S. Anderson, was rubbish too, but at least it was enjoyable in that aspect and the time flew by quick enough that you didn't have many moments to nick-pick over the inconsistencies. 'Mortal Kombat' also captured some of the visual power of the game, which 'Annihilation' fell incredibly short of. This sequel picks right up where the first left off but instead it goes for a grand epic (but derivative) story then that off the first film's basic premise. So, soon before it begins, the film has already run out of steam and turns into one banal and convoluted mess. I couldn't stop thinking that I was watching a long-winded episode of 'Days of our Lives' with a fantasy twist involved. I say that because of the corny dialog and melodramatic speeches and conversations that had me flinching. Also throw in some moralistic jargon and a script that takes itself far TOO seriously. The whole we're a family now and feel good drivel drove me crazy. It threw in everything, but the kitchen sink. After all that you just want to break out the tissues! The underlining humour in the first is all but forgotten in the follow-up and makes for one colourless viewing. The performances treaded the same path as well. Flimsy characters that bore you to death because they're so uninteresting and limp. Some just disappeared without a trace to never be heard off again. Those who stood around would rather pose most of the time. The shapeless bad guys follow the standard traits and intentions that you can see the writers really stretched their minds to come up with. Gee even the gimmicky (Halloween) costumes they wore were inferior. Although Sandra Hess as Sonya Blade was nice to look at, but the acting from all involved left a lot to be desired. No wonder why the likes of Christopher Lambert and Bridgette Wilson kept clear of this massive stink bomb.I wouldn't put it pass it being one of Uwe Boll's (House of the dead, Alone in the dark) favourite flicks. Surely the filming techniques here were an inspiration for Boll. There are some uncanny similarities from the techno soundtrack kicking right in with the bland action scenes. Hectic editing mixed with some slow motion. While the phony set designs are plain pitiful. It was all artificially void. Boll would be right at home here, that's for sure. But then again I wonder just how much of a budget this flick had compared to Boll's flicks. This one tries to look all-snazzy and throws in a lot colour in the cartoon background and unconvincing effects. But it lacks the sharp grace and the bit of style and charm that made the original entertaining. This flick's fights seemed pointless and without merit, with one lethargically repetitive one after another. The direction is poorly executed and the pacing is somewhat too slow. Simply put, this sequel that drains the life out of you, was just uncalled for.Wake me up from this bad dream. Well, it can actually put you asleep with its insipid output. Overall, it doesn't do any justice to the already awfully weak sub-genre of video game turned movie. Listen to the majority, avoid like hell!",

Take a look at Son of the Mask or Blade III for examples of poor sequels. Mortal Kombat Annihilation is iron-clad proof-positive that video games with NEVER, EVER, EVER make good movies. I don't understand why they keep trying.The first Mortal Kombat movie was FAR from brilliance. But it still had great energy, a (rather dumb) sense of humor and a really cool score by George S. Clinton crammed full of techno and trance tunes. And the fight scenes, while not graphic or breathtaking, were pure eye-candy.This sequel is cheaper, has a different cast of no-name actors, has poor, badly shot, cut and lit fight scenes, really shoddy sets and rubbish effects. The dialogue is gut-churningly horrible and the story will make you laugh out loud with it's stupidness. Seriously, Mortal Kombat Annihilation is a definite contender for Mystery Science Theatre 3000.Absolute horses balls from beginning to end. Everyone involved in making this film should be blacklisted and never allowed to work in Hollywood again.",

Ans once again to all you video game junkies, my sympathies (i guess) this movie rocked and ruled beyond any words could possibly say. first the casting. sooooooo much better than the original. Sandra Hess did a much more warm and believable Sonia Blade. and common James Remar, deadpan and srait performance make him the ultimate Rayden. The only fault is the untimely death of Johnny Cage, masterfully played by Chris Conrad this go around. Brian Thompson is also very impressive as Shao Khan. I loved the Biblical references in this one as well. Also the nonstop balls to the walls in your face action sequences. This movie just never let up. All I can say is Awesome beyond awesome, baby.

I finally watched Mortal Kombat: Annihilation for the second time since 1997. The first time I was much younger and was taken out of it after the opening Johnny Cage scene. I blocked out the rest of the movie back then. I recall being disappointed that many actors did not return, and the original director wasn't back, and held that against the film.Upon my second viewing, I realized that this movie is not as bad as I had thought, and actually held my interest from beginning to end. I also was sad when the two heroes died, but not angry. Granted, the special effects and settings are bad, but in many ways the pacing is better than the original Mortal Kombat film. The storyline itself is a fantastic port of the Mortal Kombat 3 video game.MKA completely targeted all the 1997 gamers and gave us everything we could want, if you really think about it. MKA had the secret characters from the game, animalities, fatalities, special moves, bosses, and correct costumes. There were several fights, and in many ways the new actors of Rayden and Sonya fit their roles better. Jax provided the light comic relief that Johnny Cage would have provided.The soundtrack is unbelievable, and is used throughout the movie during the proper scenes.This is worth a 1st or 2nd look!",

Leonetti had done nothing really to improve on the first movie. In fact, \"Mortal Kombat: Annihilation\" just continued on with the same pointless tirade of having characters from an arcade fighting game beat each other up in a soup of very weak storyline.The CGI effects in this 1997 sequel was every bit as horrible as it was in the 1995 movie. It was gut wrenching to witness those demons and the dragon duel on the screen, because the CGI animation was just atrocious, and the textures looked like they were borrowed directly from the PC game version of Mortal Kombat.As for the acting, well some people were doing good enough jobs here, despite the fact of having nothing to work with in terms of script and storyline. However, why they opted for Brian Thompson as the main villain was just simply beyond my comprehension.If you enjoyed the 1995 \"Mortal Kombat\" movie then you will also like the 1997 sequel \"Mortal Kombat: Annihilation\".

Viewers are given two views of a murder but it is obvious when Kevin Spacey confesses to John Cusack, the writer who is novelizing the incident, we believe him. Nonsense such as the guy walking the dog leash or the moron who appears in court with live horseflies strung to himself. The Buddhist elements serve no purpose and the conclusion is confusing. Director Clint Eastwood does major injustice with its methods of humour that often distracts. He has made mysteries with investigations before but nothing this morbid. He made the excellent Absolute Power earlier in the year, which was engaging and provocative but here he could very well have directed the worst film that this otherwise talented director has ever made. Cusack asks too many questions but never demands much of a response to the idiotic traits surrounding him. Spacey's role serves more as a prop than a vessel of meaning. Alison Eastwood and Irma P. Hall also fail to enrich this junk. A terrible misfire that indicates Eastwood was just having a bad day. Score: 1 / 10",

I watched the original Mortal Kombat when I was about 10 years old, and it was bloody brilliant to me back then, it's still \"ok\" not absolute garbage, unlike its sequel.Mortal Kombat: Annihilation has no substance, form, direction or anything remotely resembling a competent cast of actors. The director must have been a coffee machine or something, I really can't see why they decided to make a sequel. The first movie beats it easily.I quickly hit IMDb to check the scores of both the original and MK: Annihilation...A dismal score of 5.0/10 for MK, and an even lower 3.0/10 for MK:Annihilation. So I was like...\"Damn, this is a glorified power rangers...\" I could see from the start it was, when Raiden fires lighting at the beginning, it looks as though someone has put a giant bitmap overlaid onto the movie and moved it around a bit. RAIDEN btw, is now a less-hardcore version of the original kick ass Christopher Lambert Raiden, if you're gonna remove Lambert, then you need someone fairly bad ass, so what do they do? They give us a Doogie Howser lookalike who is in need of orthodontic work. Every time we see him he's through a brick wall or falling off something high. He's like a piece of ham, but with less acting ability. All his words of 'wisdom' are like \"We have to work as a team, courage...courage...look within yourself at your...courage.\" Jax is just a token black guy, Sonya is admittedly hot, but not as hot and/or as kick ass as the original Sonya. Johnny Cage gets instantly killed by some 'thug' in a skull (the final 'boss') at the very beginning. Kitana and Liu Kang are just like the 'sexually' tense element of the film. They have the funniest (not meant to be funny) part of the movie, where the \"hardcore\" Sheeva, with 4 arms, having spent the entire movie looking fearsome and generally like a big, brutal beast...runs in and says \"The date is over.\" In 5 seconds she gets killed by a falling cage, now that is comedy folks. 10 seconds of pure \"Why was she even in the movie?\" goodness.There isn't a semblance of a decent camera angle, all the scenes are \"misty\" and \"firey/smokey\" and really don't add well to the overall ambiance of the movie, they make it seem more like an 8th Grade production of some bad Shakespeare play no one cares about.OK, the first movie wasn't THAT good, but it was a 'heapload' better than the sequel, which IMHO should never have been made, I mean...they can't even use \"We needed to make money\" as an excuse, because I'm sure even the caterers who worked on this film have never been able to find work since.Ah well, this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, it's like the biggest disappointment to me, as for years I was like \"I have to see MK annihilation\" because the first one in my mind was embedded there as something \"good\". Thanks a lot John R. Leonetti I know now that you can't direct. At least not anything past Power Rangers or something? Anyhow, thats just how I felt about this movie. T_T",

There are a lot of scenes / stuff that should be engaging. But it is pointless, an under-performance or unintentionally hilarious. I don't blame the actors. Even the best actors /actress cant get much out of an awful script or a bad role. What troubles me the most are the sparks of good ideas in this movie. With adaptations and improvements you could make a better or even good movie out of the setting and some ideas. Then there are the fights. While I admit that the final confrontation is engaging the total performance is disappointing. It is sadly not even \"So bad that it is good\". That would at least improve the rating. Overall I would not rewatch and forget that this movie exist. The best I got out of it was the idea to let Dirk Nowitzki play Basketball against Bernie Sanders (and his team?).

He cannot fill the shoes of Lambert at all. This movie also has some silly to lame action sequences. Another problem is despite the many characters here, many of them are just cameos. We only see Nightwolf for a minute and that's that. The likeness of the Kombat characters here is the only redeeming quality MK:Annihlation has got.This movie is also unintentionally hilarious. There is a lot of cheese to fly around and lots of campy acting to be the ultimate \"B\" movie, just without the fun.The first installment is worlds better than this. It featured a fine cast, a good story, interesting characters and a fantastic villain.

Mortal Kombat: Annihilation rolled around and whatever worked in Mortal Kombat failed to work here. Everything about it was bad. The plot, the acting, and the screenplay filled with lame lines. It goes without saying that Mortal Kombat: Annihilation suffered a fatality at the box office, consigning it to one of the worst movies of 1997.Adapting most of the plot of Mortal Kombat 3 which was a huge hit on video consoles worldwide, Mortal Kombat: Annihilation sees the return of Liu Kang (Robin Shou), Sonya Blade (Sandra Hess), Johnny Cage (Chris Conrad) and Raiden (James Remar). Interestingly Bridgette Wilson, Linden Ashby, and Christopher Lambert wisely chose not to return for the sequel. Aided by Kitana (Talisa Soto), the warriors must battle Shao Khan (Brian Thompson) to prevent the takeover of Earth.Taking over the director's chair from Paul W.S. Anderson who wisely moved on is John R. Leonetti who is responsible for this mess of a movie.Mortal Kombat: Annihilation was just atrocious, and an example of one of the worst sequels. Stick with the first movie, in fact stick with the video games.Game over for Mortal Kombat: Annihilation.1/10.",

            "content": "Cinema standards reach a new low with this sequel to MORTAL KOMBAT, a film which really wasn't that good in the first place to deserve a sequel. Dispensing with a plot altogether (aside from some almost soap-like family shenanigans involving a family of gods), MORTAL KOMBAT: ANNIHILATION offers up loads of dodgy CGI effects work and a constant stream of action enlivened by loud, stupid music to appeal to the young teenage crowd. Yes, it's stupid to the extreme, unnecessarily violent, and also unintentionally funny with it.Opening with the \"shocking\" demise of Johnny Cage, a lead in the first film, this movie pits a diverse bunch of (mainly new) heroes against monsters, Elder Gods, and a weird bunch of ninja-types who fall from the sky in flames for some unknown reason. Aside from a few scenes set in a quarry, almost every backdrop in the movie is computer generated which makes you feel like you're watching some VR flick or something, not the intended effect I'm sure. So we have our characters traipsing around various locations, arguing, cracking dumb jokes, and fighting and killing lots of bad guys. Big deal.Said bad guys include a guy in a poor rubber monster mask who gets burned alive in a pit of flames, a woman with four arms, a centaur, a robot guy who fires explosives from his chest, and some recurring characters from the original who don't last long. The action scenes are very silly indeed, with characters seemingly unable to walk normally anymore - instead they have to leap and do acrobatics to move from one place to another. I guess the result is supposed to look \"cool\" but I found it baffling. Lots of martial arts routines are used but each and every fight is sub standard compared to the majority of martial arts flicks you'll see.The costume design is flamboyant and colourful on the eye, but it's a shame that the actors fail to fill them out very well. Robin Shou returns as Liu Kang, the heroic lead Bruce Lee-wannabe dude, but let's face it, he's wooden in the extreme. The producers couldn't even afford Christopher Lambert to reprise his role as Rayden (and when you can't afford Lambert you KNOW you're in trouble!), so instead dependable genre staple James Remar appears to put in a boring performance. The only other actor of note is Brian Thompson, a hulking guy who you may recognise from a bunch of flicks; for instance, he played the mean bad guy in COBRA. Somebody decided he should be bald for this film, but instead of making him look more terrifying, the result makes him look bald! The final involves characters turning into cheap CGI monsters, one of them ripping off the Hydra in JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS, and the effect is startlingly funny. MORTAL KOMBAT: ANNIHILATION - a rubbish film to be sure, but kind of amusing in a dumb way nonetheless.",

And yet the first one had a different quality of crazy to it. It was in a way ... \"good\". This one can not be considered anything but a train wreck. And from the surviving (and otherwise) characters of the first movie I reckon about half are being played by the same actor and the others have been recast. Not really for the better, though that is no judgement on the new ones, considering what a mess the movie is in general.One switch was for the better though, even if maybe only slightly! It is getting rid of the ex Highlander ... guess there can be two - when it comes to portraying the same character. Now I assume my review up to here is at least as funny as the movie or maybe even more so. Don't be fooled by that. Don't get sucked in and then blame me if you don't like it ... this is really bad, but for some reason it was also enjoyable in the way that it didn't make any sense at all ... even less than the first one.

With an exception of Lui Kang and Kitana, EVERY character is replaced. and not for the better.. Personally, I think Sonya Blade is hotter in this one than the first but she's a worse actor so that pretty much cancels out.The story is garbage! It doesn't even follow the game! It's clearly noticeable that the ONLY goal as far as the story, was for it to include as many characters and their 'in-game moves' as they could regardless of their back stories. For example, Jax is a character that lost his arms in the game and replaces them with robotic ones. In the movie, he has his arms but they are 'muscle enhancers'... doesn't even make much sense to me.I honestly can't tell if the script is god-awful or the acting. Was it a great script that was poorly performed or great performances that had to be executed the way they were due to how it was written? I take that back. I can tell. It's both a terrible script with god awful performances. Sets, costumes, and stunts were all pretty bad as well. The costumes make you feel like you're in a college Halloween party while the sets look like they were cheaply made at my mom's house. The stunts/fight scenes are all executed in a way that made them seem like they were trying to be the deleted fight scene of a power rangers episode. The soundtrack from the first movie went platinum! In 10 days!! This time? It sounded like a 10 year old kid's Zumba class... Overall, this movie ONLY to be watched as a joke. It is the epitome of the thought that a video game should STAY a video game! I gave it 3 stars because I'm a huge fan of the game so seeing some of my favorite characters was cool (even if I had to be some form of intoxicated to enjoy it) and also, this movie helped guide me to know what NOT to have made my scorpion Halloween costume look like.",

Johnny Cage is recast just in time to die, as Earth is invaded by Shao Kahn(portrayed by Brian Thompson, imposing as usual, and unfortunately a less memorable villain than Shang Tsung, though he does go for being as hammy... as does everyone else meant to be evil) whose men enter from the sky(no, really, it literally is raining men... hallelujah). On his side is Sindel(Kitana's mother), who was resurrected(after three days), and our only hope is for the two to be reunited. Yup, that's the entire plot(it's as obvious as they come... and it's got a ton of holes). They must have been very proud of this, as they keep restating it, as if expecting the audience to have an extremely short attention span. This would explain why this is almost all martial arts. And granted, they are well-choreographed, filmed and edited well... and devoid of impact, as we get no backstory on anyone(most don't even get namedropped). In fact, this has at least one new character(none of whom get development... even our leads only get what they had in the predecessor, if that) introduced per scene, and many of them don't stay beyond that sequence. We get no motivations, so they are as anonymous as the nameless henchmen in your average action flick, other than their costumes(some of which are done well). That's unless you're a fan of the games, and if you are, why wouldn't you be playing, instead? Oh, they tend to get to do cool moves, but that's really it, and you won't even know who they are if you didn't already. Is it that much of an attraction to see something on the silver screen that you can already help control? Evidently not, as this deservedly bombed. And the series of face-offs is the one thing this has going for it. Exposition is clumsily handled, the dialog ranges from bad to downright painful, and save for Dexter's adoptive father, no one in this can act. The tone is cheesy, not unlike Power Rangers, seen for example in the FX(of which there are a ton). For how much supposedly happens in this, I was pretty bored watching it. Not like I wanted to be doing other things, just that it never grabbed me, and I frankly doubt I'll remember much of this tomorrow. There is once again next to no blood, violence and gore in this. I recommend this to those wanting to see a bunch of humans and creatures from the MK universe duke it out. Anyone else, don't expect this to tell you what's going on or give you a reason to give a crap about anything you see. 1/10.",

This movie is directed by John Leonetti (Annabelle) and stars James Remar (Once Upon a Time in Hollywood), Brian Thompson (Cobra), Talisa Soto (Spy Hard) and Robin Shou (Death Race). The storyline for this, like the previous film, was kind of blah. The script and acting was also dreadful and why couldn't they find a good Raiden for either film? However, the fight scenes, while inconsistent, was much better than the first film. Some of the CGI fight sequences worked and some of them didn't, like the entire opening scene (which was dreadful). The use of characters in this was so much better than the first film, loved the addition of the robots. There wasn't really a worthwhile villain to get excited about, unfortunately.

            "content": "I still remember seeing this movie. At the time, I was enamored with all things Mortal Kombat and I greatly enjoyed the first film even though I knew it wouldn't sweep the Oscars. So when the movie theater I worked at put this poster up I just KNEW I had to see it. And I did.Thus it is with great trepidation that I write this reluctant review. I really wanted so much to like this movie but... I just can't.Where to begin? Well, obviously for those who saw the first movie, some key players got Darrined. Sonya, Johnny Cage, and Rayden are all played by different actors. The only problem I had with the new actors was the usual disappointment of getting attached to the originals. Believe it or not, I actually preferred the new Sonya as she seemed more badass and true to the original game character design. Johnny isn't around long enough for you to hate him and James Remar is OK, but he's no Lambert. If only Sandra Hess had been in the first one instead of the lame Bridgette Wilson.The plot is just all over the map in this one. Rules are established then broken without explanation. Plot twists are introduced then forgotten. There's mystic nonsense about elder gods, Kitana having to reunite with her mother to save the world, Shao Khan being able to do whatever he wants because of Kitana's mother, finding your inner animality and Rayden giving up his immortality. Liu Kang is given three tests by a magical Native American but the movie forgets the other two and apparently courageousness means being able to resist a hot woman in a bikini. Sonya rescues Jax who has been given bionic metal arms because... your guess is good as mine. SubZero shows up to offer assistance to the heroes at a later time but later never comes. Kitana gets to play damsel in distress. Motaro and Sheeva hate each other but we have no idea why. Rain gets killed because he didn't make his victims suffer enough. Nobody seems to wonder where the rest of the people on earth disappeared to. Jade turns traitor because the script says so, I guess. Most people also cite that Johnny Cage is unceremoniously killed off at the beginning but his death was actually a plot point in MK3 (the game was on MK4 when the movie came out) so I can understand why they did it. The rest of it, who knows? The dialogue and acting are just bad. It's fitting that Shao Kahn and Sindel are king and queen because in terms of acting, they are made of ham. Musetta Vander gets such awful dialogue that one wonders if she wasn't overacting on purpose and Brian Thompson is impossible to take seriously because of his scene-chewing delivery and less than imposing stature. Both Rayden and Sonya feel the need to comment on new hairstyles and the importance of personal hygiene in the middle of an apocalypse. Jax is another stereotypical black dude with attitude and Irina Pataneva (Jade) once again proves that walking down a runway does not automatically translate into acting ability.I would comment on the other characters' acting ability but therein lies another problem: most of the characters aren't on screen long enough to actually act. Characters are thrown into the middle of the action, most without proper introduction only to be killed or forgotten seconds later, some of them without even fighting. Outsiders to the Mortal Kombat game franchise will have no idea who most of these people are and fans of the games will only see their favorite characters long enough to say \"Yep, that's Baraka,\" \"Yep, that's Mileena.\" The movie ends up being a cavalcade of cameos due to the disproportionally short running time and does the already flimsy plot no favors.Every bad movie, of course, has one area that it excels at in terms of badness, and while the above examples are certainly worthy contenders, the special effects truly get the ultimate razzie here. I'm not one to pick on special effects too much but even I could tell these were bad. Highlights include the laughably bad CGI wall monster, the green screen lab explosion, the shapeshifter showdown between Liu Kang and Shao Kahn that looks straight out of the mind of Ray Harryhausen, and Motaro. Just... Motaro. They say that an actual Sheeva fight was originally planned but scrapped due to budget constraints. Judging by the effects they actually DID keep, that was probably a wise decision.It pains me to have to trash this movie. I wanted so much to like it. I really did. But even as I watched it in the movie theater a week after opening, the whole thing just felt off. It almost played out like a parody or cheap knockoff of the first film. I also couldn't help but noticing that after the first weekend, the audience had all but vanished.Perhaps I should've taken the hint.",

The acting is lowered and at times embarrassing. The dialogue feels amateurish.The characters are worse. People may have found Johnny Cage to be annoying in the original but he was a better character than Jax in this film. The recast of Sonya was a slight upgrade. Kitana is essentially the same. Liu Kang is worse here, more annoying and \"in the way\" (the acting by Robin Shou seems uninspired). The recast of Raiden is also downgrade. None of the villains really stand out. Sub-zero and Scorpion have brief scenes.This film tried craming in too many characters without given them much to do. The fight scenes are just as tame and even though there may be more overall in this sequel, they aren't memorable. A lot of the fight scenes just feel randomly placed. The finale battle drags on and feels bland. Predictable and without any gore or strong violence, it just doesn't work well.Overall the plot is sort of a rehash of the original but this here feels less inspired and more rushed.",

            "review_title": "Brilliant follow up and worthy adaptation of the game (CONTAINS SLIGHT SPOILERS)",
            "content": "Following the tradition of Aliens and Superman II , what we have here is a very decent and well made sequel which finally does justice to the basic premise which their predecessors failed to capture and execute . The only reason I can find for why all this negative publicity , is of course that the reviews were written by people who weren 't related anyway with the Mortal Kombat video game or were not true fans of it .As a natural result they were confused due to the fast pace of the plot and the way-too-many-characters who were squashed in breathlessly . Therefore I will officially declare that although you have a point , MK II is addressed to the hardcore fans of the game who know the entire history and so will be my review . If you are a fan who hasn 't still watched Annihilation this is a must see . The rest of you should stop reading and  stick to the first Mortal Kombat which is a more easy to follow and digestible film with less characters . For the \"ordinary\" audience the first installment is a decent enough kung fu movie I guess .First things first : the original Mortal Kombat was a genuine letdown for the fans . It had underdevelopped characters , mediocre script , LOUSY SFX (especially the freezing power of Sub Zero) , predictable and rather badly directed fight scenes ( Johnny Cage Vs Goro anyone ?) and a quite disappointing climax with the obligatory cliffhanger epilogue as a setup for the sequel . The final result was lame beyond words . Something had to be done and fortunately the sequel came in quickly . Who cares if Christopher Lambert (Rayden) and Bridgette Wilson (Sonya) didn 't reprise their roles and were replaced ? Both of them , along with the wisecracking , pretentiously cool , dislikeable Johnny Cage were nothing more than decorative roles existing only due to the storyboard formula of the Mortal Kombat I game . The only likeable star you rooted for was Liu Kang and the narration 's heart beats with him . Thank God Robin Shou returns in the main role . A nice touch was also the return of Talisa Soto as Kitana as her sub - erotic interplay with Kang is interesting and keeps the attention (they share good chemistry) . The two of them are great (the acting is miles better this time) and the two substitutes for Rayden and Sonya are passable. I also digged the sceptic , puzzled and simultaneously funny and comedic aspect Lynn Williams managed to infuse to the character of Jax ( who was portrayed very faithfully and kicked a** with his bionic fists ) Every part of the sequel is improved : acting , much more convincing and well directed fight scenes and better plot . I really can 't understand why all this whining \" why Johnny Cage is killed off so easily ? \" . PLEASE do some research next time !!!!! This is exactly what happens in the story of the MK II game . The movie begins with the invasion of Shao Kahn 's troops from the Outworld . Then we are introduced to Kitana 's mother the Queen Sindel who is supposed to be Shao Kahn 's bride (just like the MK 3 story) and is probably the key to Earth 's salvation or destruction . From there on the story follows the 4 leads (Jax , Liu , Sonya and Rayden) struggling to save themselves from Kahn 's minions .  Yes you guessed right there is plenty of action and the fight scenes are great . The plot is a mix from the stories of MK II & MK III .\nI can still hear complaints \" woo woo , too many characters too little development \" . GIMME A BREAK ! This is an action film not a social drama . The ninja choreography and the SFX for the most part are great and are enough to keep you hooked on  . Some examples are : the aforementioned freezing power of Sub Zero and the bionic punches of Jax , the net traps by Cyrax , the tele-transport of Ermac/Noob Saibot , the great CG Motaro who is frighteningly impressive and compelling , the banshee-esque supersonic screams by Sindel etc . Moreover I would like to point out that most of the characters of the video game are secondary and somehow naturally DESTINED to make a cameo and nothing more . The best example is probably Mileena : in the game she is a clad-in-pink evil duplicate of Kitana , fabricated by the evil sorcerer Shang Tsung . In the film she pops out in one scene and fights Sonya with her triple-edged knives (of course she loses) . What did you expect from the script ? A whole subplot with Kitana 's two sides and a psychological doubt game about who-is-who a la Uma Thurman in the Avengers ? I know that each one of you has a favorite character and hated to see him in blink appearances but you should stop whining and think logically . Cyrax and Smoke are nothing but robots programmed to annihilate Sub Zero after his betrayal . Nightwolf is a mystic Indian Shaman and shouldn 't be seen fighting physically rather than mentally so his brief appearance in a dream sequence as Liu 's mentor was wise . All these characters along with Scorpion or Baraka have cameos and that is the most fair . The focus should be on the leads and not on the henchmen - villains . My personal favorite was the groundbreaking Sheeva and I disliked seeing her written out quickly without any decent fights . The same goes for the weather-controlling Rain but I compromised since the good parts of the film are more than the bad ones .I will agree that some of the most powerful characters are dispatched easily but the movie needed some realistic action and the leads are constantly on the run , pursued by the bounty hunters . I really digged the fact that the stories and the background was followed accurately and faithfully e.g. the hate relationship between Motaro and Sheeva , the origin and motives of Jade (I won 't say more) , the Kitana \u0096 Sindel weird relationship and the fact Rayden sacrifices his immortality to join the tournament (this takes place in the Ultimate MK 3) . I won 't say that the film doesn 't have some serious defects .1) The greatest flaw was of course Shao Kahn . AGHHHH! As soon as he is unmasked his myth is shattered !! The actor did a LOUSY job - he wasn 't even remotely threatening or scary . Where is his commanding chilling voice ? Even worse he loses center stage since the main villain seems to be Shinnok from MK4 . In the film Shinnok is Kahn \u0091s divine mighty father . Shao Kahn ends up as a weak , whining boy who doesn \u0091t have his will to make decisions and constantly expects his father to find the solutions !!!. GRRRRRRRR......2) The beyond ridiculous , ingenious plot twists at the end (what were they thinking ?????)3) The ludicrous and corny Animality effectsIf you can overlook these facts and concentrate on the merits you will have a nice dose of entertainment . The ending hopefully restores the script and gives the much needed resolution . I should give this a 9 but due to the awful depiction of Shao Kahn I am compelled to give a\n8 / 10\nThis sequel is a very good adaptation of the game , at least for the ones who know the story . I hope that MK 3 : Domination will overcome all the script flaws and be even better . In the meantime Annihilation is the best of the bunch .",

Me and my friend just couldn't believe the amount of crap we had just witnessed, and I was barely 12 at the time of it.I saw the first one with more friends, when I was ten, but I still think today, 17 y.o., that it has some good things like a very decent cast and a director that somehow makes his best. I actually got to like Paul W.S. Anderson's Event Horizon and Resident Evil.It's bad from the beggining when we realize that they have change almost all the original cast (except for Kitana and Liu Kang, who hopefully will die in the... third movie!) and hated them even more when they killed immediately my favorite character (talking about Johnny Cage who didn't say anything *smart* or at least kissed Sonya goodbye).Whoever thought that the skinny Sandra Hess could replace the athletic and beautiful Bridget Wilson as Sonya was out of his mind. And the choice for Rayden sucked too, I'd prefer Mr Highlander for ever.There's really nothing good in this movie, the action, script, acting, casting and directing are incredibly bad and will make sick anybody with some sort of good taste . And the plot is even more ridicoulous than the videogame.A reviewer said that those who don't like MK:A it's because thay don't like the videogame or haven't played it. Too bad I've played every version for many gaming systems, and liked it to the point I even bought the comic and some action figures. Too bad I'm a big fan who grew old and realized how bad a videogame to movie can be.This movie is not the kind of crap that will at least entertain you for a couple of hours like it happened to me with Armageddon. Don't bother, it is not worth in any way.Perhaps the only good thing (if any) is the short and dumb but nevertheless mud wrestling between sonya and the other girl (either Jade or Mileena, the last one I think), but too short... and too many clothes.\nProbably the only good point (if any) from this movie was the mud wrestling, but it was too short and too dressed.",

            "content": "Oh where to begin? Well, first of all, this movie is not as terrible as people say. Annihilation tried too hard to look like the MK 3 game. I mean, it tried to show all the characters (even from MK II) and their special powers. Every character from MK 3 and UMK3 are present in the movie, even only by reference (Kabal and Stryker). The f/x were quite good until the horrible, cheesy Animality combat between Kang and Kahn.So the plot is exactly the same as in the MK 3 game but with a few dramatic insertions such as Shao Kahn being Raiden's brother, and some things about Sindel. It's true that MK 2 is the best game so far from the series, but it's also true that MK 3's plot is the best. It deals with the Outworld squads invading earth in order for Shao Kahn to take full control of it. Luckily for humanity, there are chosen warriors who are brave enough to face Kahn's extermination armies and save the world. But basically, this is a copy of the MK 3 plot but with different lead characters. The premise is really good but the director didn't know how to display the events in a decent manner. The success of MK 3's plot is how it's explained and developed through the characters' background. In Annihilation the events happen in a non sense manner and we don't have enough character development. Only Raiden tells the chosen warriors to believe in themselves and mocks about Jax's arms. The rest of the movie are pure scenes of mindless combat scenes. Which by the way, aren't as good as in the previous MK movie that had truly great martial arts moves. In this one, the sequences aren't as good as in the video game! The main problem with the movie is that it tried to explore many character backgrounds and also tried to display many special powers, fatalities, etc. in such a short running time. Why would they only mention Kabal and Stryker? Why would they include Rain, Mileena, Sub-Zero, Scorpion, Nightwolf, Ermac, etc. if they only appeared for 1 minute?! Sheeva was a waste of running time and Motaro wasn't even as cool as Goro from the previous movie. But the movie deserves credit for trying to be almost a replica of the MK 3 game. Heck, Johnny Cage also dies in this one. You may chuckle at some points after noticing references to fatalities, friendships, and character backgrounds from the game. But that is not enough. \"Annihilation\" is a mediocre attempt to capitalize the huge success of the first movie. A good sequel does not means copying the techno music, or f/x. The actors weren't that bad. Robin Shou and Talisa Soto were great in their reprising roles. Talisa is a delight to watch. The same goes for Sandra Hess. Sonya couldn't be hotter! Brian Bosworth was an over the top evil character but he has good in the role. The actor who played Jax was a nice addition because he added some comedy moments. Raiden was a wuss and wasn't as bad-ass as the original but still had his moments.Overall, watch this movie ONLY, ONLY if you are a die hard fan of the MK games, specially part 3. If not, avoid this like the plague!",

Anderson being the director). This sequel picks right up where its 1995 predecessor left off and sort of goes downhill from that point on.\"MK\" cameos abound in this sequel, almost none of which are given their fair share of screen time or character development. You know who I'm talking about; I'm talking about Cyrax, Smoke, Kabal and Stryker (who are mentioned but never seen), Mileena, Nightwolf, Rain, Ermac, Baraka, Sub-Zero (unmasked), Scorpion, Noob Saibot, and Reptile.All these characters are seen (or talked about) in this movie but are barely given the time they were so kindly awarded in the video games. Most of these characters had made their debuts in \"Mortal Kombat 2\" or \"3\" but we barely see them or know who they are (this is especially troubling for those that may have never played the games).The acting is way out there, the script tried to be something more than it was (apparently a lot more was filmed but dropped from the finished product - damn execs) and the fights are sub-par.The reason for my disdain is the fact that I loved Anderson's first movie and I found it difficult to sit through this entry.I only hope \"3\" redeems the series.3/10",

This would lead Warner Bros. To make a sequel. Annihilation picks up where the first movie ended, as the Temple of Light is invaded by Shao Kahn and his Outworld warriors, despite Liu Kang and his allies defeating Shang Tsung and winning the Mortal Kombat tournament. Shao Kahn proceeds to start merging Earth with Outworld, revivng Sindel, Kitana's mother, and kills Johnny Cage when he tries to stop him. Liu Kang must seek the aid of Nightwolf to help him with this new threat, as new ally Jax joins the battle.One of the biggest problems this movie suffers from is the recasts. Once you hear Raiden's speech at the start of the movie, you will know that is not Christopher Lambert playing him, but James Raimer (who starred in other box office adaptation bombs like Judge Dredd and The Phantom). Sadly, even Sonya, and Johnny Cage (who gets only one line in this film) are recast. The only actors returning to reprise their roles are Robin Shou as Liu Kang and Talisa Soto as Kitana, making this feel like a direct-to-video sequel that was accidentally released in theaters. Also, the writing is bad, as it changes some story elements, like making Raiden and Shao Kahn brothers (which is messed up), and the fact that Scorpion and Sub-Zero only get one scene, and that's it (which is horrible, considering the two ninjas have one of the most legendary rivalries in video games, whereas in this movie, Scorpion captures Kitana, and is never seen again, as well as Sub-Zero after warning Liu Kang not to go after her).Another issue is the special effects, as they are lazy due to the movie being unfinished (as the producer of this would reveal in a book that it never finished post-production), and the Animalities, which features in this movie, are so horribly done, I swear the models look like something rejected from Primal Rage. MK: Annihilation becomes yet another bad movie based on a video game and a major disgrace to the 1995 movie it follows.",

So what went wrong?First of all, they lost Lambert, Ashby, and Tagawa from the first movie. That was a big shot in the foot.  James Remar (who seems to have no idea why he's here, and that Raiden is supposed to be comic relief ala Raiden in the first movie) is no Chris Lambert.  Chris Conrad (very briefly) is no Linden Ashby.  And Brian Thompson, even though a credible screen bad guy, is no Tagawa.Robin Shou, as charismatic as he may be, just can't carry the load.  Talisa Soto, another carryover, just has nothing to do.  In new roles, Sandra Hess at least does no harm stepping in for Bridgette Wilson.  Lynn Williams as Jax doesn't do bad, but then he's thwarted by the plot...Ouch, the plot.  What is it, exactly?  They played fast and easy with the \"rules\" in the first movie, but any sense of coherency is totally lost with this one.  The fate of Earth is in the balance, but they're fighting it out in caves and quarries like something out of Doctor Who.  There are three tests, but what's the third?  If the bad guys don't give a damn about the Elder Gods, why the heck did they play by the Gods' rules in the first movie.  Undercutting your first movie's basic concept just doesn't help you.And the plot is just too full.  Apparently Boon and Tobias, buoyed by the success of the first movie, said to themselves, \"Cool, now we can throw in all the faceless villains the marketing guys they told us would be too much for the audience in the first movie.\"  Whoops - this inundation of characters is too much for the audience in the second movie as well.  Why is Sub-Zero a good guy, and where does he go?  Who the heck is Nightwolf, and why doesn't he help save Earth other than to give Liu Kang the test(s)? What purpose do characters like Jade, Sheeva, and Montaro serve other than to provide some kung fu cannon fodder?  It's like we had one good human villain (Shang Tsung) and one good F/X villain (Prince Goro) in the first movie, so they decided, \"Hey, lets put in two human villains and two F/X villains in this one.\"Which brings us to the F/X.  Arrgh.  There is none of the care that obviously went into the first movie, which whatever its deficiencies, at least gave you something good to look at.  In the rush to kick out a sequel (barely two years), they obviously spent neither time or money.So MK: A is mildly viewable in a martial arts/fantasy kind of way.  The fight sequences are still good to look at. But the animated series, or the subsequent prequel of the TV series, is probably better to watch if you're looking for something entertaining.",

We have James Remar replacing Christopher Lambert as Raiden(better actor than Lambert maybe but is a lacklustre and far less funny Raiden than Lambert's version), Sandra Hess replacing Bridgette Wilson as Sonya Blade(not a bad replacement and does more fighting but looks nothing like the actress she replaces)and worst of all Chris Conrad replacing Linden Ashby as Johnny Cage(this was the worst as the idiotic makers kill the character off inside of 7 minutes, the new actor got one line that I can remember, no wonder Linden turned this farce down).It keeps on going down hill from here as this cast truly is as wooden as a piece of plywood plus they constantly rattle off line after line of atrocious dialogue(or is that direlogue)that soon becomes funny when its not supposed to. Lines like Kitana ''Mother, I thought you were dead'' Sindel ''Too bad you WILL DIE''. Jax ''You got a incredible set of legs...For kicking I mean'' and Kitana ''My mother is dead'' Sindel ''As will be her daughter'', its all dreadful(there are many more too).The other really embarrassing aspect of MK2 is the woeful visual effects(said to be amazing on the dvd back cover), this is from 1998 and should of been far superior to this. Whether its the stone statue's that turn into abysmal looking beasts(hurt my eyes), cardboard cut out looking landscapes, un exciting looking explosions(explosions need to be cool, these were not)and worst of all that short bit in the climatic fight where Liu Kang and Shao Kahn turn into Kaiju looking creatures, my God above what was that, one looks like a dreadful looking version of King Ghidorah and the other a unscary looking version of that mutated wolf in Rampage(what was in the makers heads with that, made the movie even worse somehow).Lastly we have the characters that to be fair look the part but are all badly short-changed. New characters from the games include Shao Kahn, Shinnok, Motaro(looks very cool but ruined by the tepid acting), Jade, Sheeva, Ermac, Cyrax, Milena, Nightwolf(''Cool huh, its my Animality'', SIGH)and Sindel(worst acting from a actress ever to me)plus we have the returning ones like Liu Kang, Kitana(both Robin Shou and Talisa Soto deserve better), Sonja, Raiden, Scorpion, Sub-Zero(both wasted), Johnny(briefly)and Jax(becoming a main character now after a brief appearance in MK1, albeit by another actor). Nearly all are awful and hardly anyone has any chemistry, the original had a cast that had pretty great camaraderie but here its very laughable and stiff to watch especially when they try and be funny or threaten each other.One thing that stops Annihilation from getting the dreaded one star is the pretty good fight scenes, and though like the original they could be better, we got a pretty good amount of them. Saying that though some are poorly done with bad effects and way over the top reactions from the actors at times(plus was Raiden trying to do hip hop in one of those fights, bizarre tbh). Best fights were Scorpion V Sub-Zero(with added 'GET OVER HERE' of course), Sonja/Jax v Cyrax, Liu Kang V Baraka, Sonja V Milena and Jax V Motaro. Let downs were Liu Kang V Shao Kahn, Kitana V Sindel and Liu Kang V Jade.This has to go down as one of the biggest messes to hit a cinema screen, the acting is so bad its both cringing and laughable in equal measures(but damn funny too), the visuals stink, the plot a mess(taking over the world never seemed likely with such a un powerful lead villain), characters/actors looking different from before(either changing the actors to look nothing like who they replaced or not looking how they should be, like Raiden, must wear the lampshade head gear damn it), dreadful looking creatures, a bizarre Kaiju fight out of nowhere, pitiful lines, making Raiden weak(plus you can tell that is a stunt double or doubles a mile off), killing Johnny Cage very early, actors that clearly are in front of green screen throughout and rubbish explosions. Yes the fights are mostly cool, Robin Shou and Talisa Soto were decent and most of the characters(mainly the new ones)look like the video game originals, but MK Annihilation is still possibly the worst big screen movie ever made and maybe the worst sequel in history.Also why was Raiden and Sindel brought back and not Johnny Cage, man you treated a iconic character bad MK:A.GET OUT OF HERE, NOW.",

            "content": "Turns out that Shang Tsung's boss Shao Kahn (Brian Thompson in an extremely terrible performance) cheated and decides to rule the earth anyway, seems he broke the rules, he also proves his brute force by killing off Johnny Cage and this time it's up to Liu Kang, Sonya, Jax, Kitana and Rayden to defend the earth. The normally quite good James Remar as a thunder god, alone gets me to chuckle. Not to mention dialog from Remar which come off so cheesy it just gets you cry \"Are they serious?\". Among the terrible things Remar says it is these that get the biggest laughs. To Wit: \"Think of it as hell on earth!\"\"You will do your best, it's all that's expected\"\"Alone you're vulnerable,together you're unbeatable\"\"My brother died, his heart anyway\" \"My powers are leaving me!\" (Probably a reference to his acting ability)\"I'm proud to die mortal!\" (The funniest line in the film)Also James Remar obviously is no martial artist but because of stunt doubles, movie magic has provided us with a fight sequence so brilliant in its ineptitude, I give this an extra star. Still there is even more inspired awfulness outside of the worst performance of Remar's career (And I saw Rent-A-Cop) Brian Thompson is also terrible giving us lines such as To Wit:\"Annhilate them!\"\"Bow at my feet!\"\"The portal is merging and it is GLORIOUS!\"\"You're already dead and you will be soon!\"\"The earth was created in six days, so it will be destroyed!\" \"And your friends will be DEAD!\"And much, much more awkwardness. There is of course other things that happen that are extremely hysterical, mainly watching Jax deliver lines so embarrassing, I was almost ashamed that he was my favorite character to play as in the game. We also get a mud-fight between Sonya and the pink-girl ninja. Special effects so embarrassingly bad you'd swear you were watching the power rangers and overall you have one of the cheesiest, silliest and downright hilarious movies ever made. Also the whole \"I can feel my animality!\" seems more of line spoken in a porno then it does in a video game. I can just see a porn star saying to another porn star, after their rendezvous, \"Pretty cool huh? That's my animality!\"* * out of 4-(Fair) 1/2* out of 4-(Awful)-(For those who don't laugh at campy bad movies)",

            "content": "Whoa-ho. Where do I start? The first thing I noticed in this movie was that Rayden was not Christopher Lambert... Okay, fair enough I thought, maybe he was busy on another project and didn't have time to return for this one, and they had like, some kinda deadline? And then sure enough, a little re-shoot of the movie's first ending plays out and we're looking at a guy in a rubber skull mask, really nasty, blatant blue-screening and meteors falling from the sky who are actually ninjas. And it's about this time I notice that Sonya's hair has been abruptly cut shorter, just seconds after the end of the first film; Bridgette Wilson is absent. Why? She, like countless others who participated in the first movie, refused to work on this one. Leonetti's script was read, and almost everyone, including Paul Anderson, the guy who went on to become known as the talentless pioneer of horrible video game related movies that totally disregard the usual plot, said it sucked. And if Paul Anderson thinks something sucks, along with half your potential cast, surely that's a cue to revise it? No. Not for Leonetti. He decided to direct the movie himself around this horrible script, with embarrassing lines like \"I have already claimed THOUSANDS of souls!\", \"Centaurs are renowned for their hunting prowess!\", and the legendary \"Too bad YOU... will DIE!\" to keep everyone laughing at the original script reading. Then there's Sindel's insane impersonation of the Wonder Woman transformation while laughing like a demon (I found myself laughing too...), and a final confrontation between Liu Kang and Shao Khan's Animalities in HOLY CRAP IS THAT STOP MOTION? In an age of CG, you use stop motion? There was plenty of CG in rest of the film! (If that really was CG, I'm sorry. I honestly thought it was stop motion, what with that dodgy frame-rate.There's a huge cast of filler characters too, like Rain, Baraka, Ermac, that monster thing that Jax punches senseless, Mileena... And the damn film is so cheap that when Baraka dies they just use the shot of Rain dying, hoping we won't notice.Here's a tip for all you scriptwriters out there: If 90% of your cast and crew read your script and say \"I'm not working on this\", please consider improving it.

Another problem is that the Johnny Cage's character (again a different actor this time around) is killed off right off the bat.

The premise of the film sees the warriors of Earthrealm attempt to stop Shao Kahn's invasion.Main Character\nRobin Shou as Liu Kang and Talisa Soto as Kitana were the only actors who reprised their role from the previous film and after watching this train wreck it is easy to see why. Neither of them are very good in the film and it seems like they were the only ones who signed a 2 film contract so they were forced to be here. The characters are so bland and you won't care about them or anybody that appears on screen.Supporting Characters\nJames Remar takes up the role of Raiden and he is so dull and poor. At least Christopher Lambert is so over the top its ridiculous but Raiden is given way more to do in this film and the character just isn't very interesting with Rear clearly not enjoying himself at all. Sandra Hess and Lynn Williams take up the roles of Sonya and Jax respectively and they offer very little and Jax actually became really annoying and I was wishing he had as much screen time as he did in the first film. At least the new guy they cast as Johnny Cage realised he only wanted a small role and doesn't barely appear here. Shao Khan is finally here as the villain and he is so clich\u00e9, the awesome character from the game is gone and replaced by this bloke who isn't actually that intimidating. There are more characters from the games here but they are used so poorly that I just wish they hadn't bothered.Story\nThe story is all over the place. It's like the film wants to get through the majority of the stories in the game but it rushes all of the without explanation and it makes fans like me incredibly frustrated. The whole plot is absurd and there is one element of the film that breaks all kinds of lore and makes the film laughably stupid with a really stupid ending.Script\nThe script of the first film had some charm, yes it was cheesy but it kind of worked. This one is just so bad, with a mix of terrible acting and terrible acting it is just terrible and left me shaking my head as to how somebody got paid to write this mess.Style\nNow the most important part of Mortal Kombat - the fights. They are terrible, the overuse of slow mo is obvious because the cast just weren't particularly great at fight choreography or at least making them. Then you get the effects, they are so bad, maybe some of the worst I have ever seen. I know people will say it had a small budget, then they shouldn't have tried this rubbish.Overall\nOverall, Mortal Kombat: Annihilation is one of the worst films I have ever seen. There is no redeeming qualities to this film and no wonder it has taken nearly 25 years for a big budget reboot, avoid this film at all costs.Rating - 1/10.",

            "content": "Since the first film was based on MK1 with hints at number MK2, Annihilation is appropriately based on MK3 with a few hints of MK4.  It makes all the mistakes of the Street Fighter film, makes the mistakes of typical sequels, and comes across as a slapped together project from the script on up.The SF mistakes - way too many characters from the games in this movie in their colorful videogame-esque costumes, most cameo's are completely unnecessary.  What point was there behind the Cyrax fight?  The Mileena fight?  How 'bout Jade and Smoke's presence?  To show Kahn's extermination squads in 'pretty' costumes on screen?  Okay fine, show the extermination squad but make them look like extermination squads and not a Power Rangers episode . . .And in the game Mileena and Jade go after Kitana.  Cyrax and Smoke have nothing to do with Khan.  What's happening?  They're rewriting half the characters.  In MK1 it was okay that they tweaked Scorpion/Sub-Zero since those were the only ones that really got a backstory makeover.  Not only that, but they're rewriting character stories as an excuse to get them on screen and participate in one lousy fight.  I don't think so.Sequel mistakes - everything the first one did has to be done on a bigger scale.  More characters, more finishing moves, more effects, more moves from the game, even more exaggerated lines and camera moves . . . the problem lay in the fact the first Mortal Kombat walked a fine line between serious martial arts flick and campy video game flick.  Exaggerate anything and you immediately start hitting camp territory.Christopher Lambert and Cary-Hiroyuki Takawa's memorable, slightly over the top performances are replaced by James Remar and Brian Thompson's way-overdone-over-the-top-100%-ham performances.  Speaking of the actors, very few reprised their role for the original . . . which never goes over well unless the new people surpass the old cast (or the old cast just flat out sucked).  Add to that the fact everyone flips everywhere with exaggerated martial arts moves redundant lines that stoop to a new low and you have Mortal Kombat: Power Rangers.  Can't they walk normally and have a normal conversation just once?Also, nowhere in the first film or the game is the plot about a finishing move.  True, maybe MK's trademark `Fatalities' made the game, but the game itself and the first movie was not about Fatalities.  So why is Annihilation about the corny (even in the game) Animalities?  MK2 (the game) threw in joke finishing (Friendships and Babalities) moves to poke fun at the anti-violence in video game movement at the time; MK3 took it too far with not only reprising the joke finishing moves but adding more: the stupid additions of Animalities and Mercies.  They were stupid in the game; was it ever stupid watching it on the big screen.  But hey, they had to one up the first film right?  Wrong!A slapped together set of ideas?  You bet.  Character cameos that come across as an excuse to get someone on screen at said time with little regards to their actual backstory in the game.  Like a fan-fic, `Hey, let's just use these characters however the hell I feel like using them.'  A desperate bid to shock the audience by killing off a character in an unimaginative and anti-climactic matter (lacking the emotional and plot impact it should).  No character/plot arc for the main characters, the good guys need to find inner strength-blah-blah-blah throughout the first half of the film, make absolutely no progress and are suddenly ready to save the world.  They don't even wake up one day and poof have it, he just has it for no reason.At least Street Fighter had the excuse of trying things in a pretty much unexplored genre and failing.  Annihilation knew better, and walked the way of Street Fighter anyway when it should have continued the path the original Kombat film set down.",

All the action looked like it was taking place right there. The colors were full and rich, the sets looked real. In this movie, it looked like everything was shot in one place, and the backgrounds and sets were drawn in later.\nWell, you might ask next, what about the characters? Certainly the famous Mortal Kombat characters were interesting. Well, no. First, they brought back I believe 6 people from the last movie (4 good guys and 2 bad) but only two of the actors were the same. And in comparison, the new actors were pretty lame. The new characters, save for one, were never really utilized to their abilities. There was this centaur looking fellow who looked cool, but wasn't really used till the end. The woman with 4 arms, again cool looking, but not used till the end.Well, you might ask, what about the story? Well this time instead of a mortal kombat tournament to take over the world, the bad guys invade the earth illegally. But really, does anyone go to these kinds of movies for a plot? I think the writer/director/producer thought so, because this plot wasn't explored really at all. And the writing. I can't remember the last time I heard writing so lousy. It's been a long time since I've been this disappointed in a movie. I would put the blame on the director this time. The first Mortal Kombat was exciting, and visually stunning. This one is more like the cheap crappy little brother that should have been buried in the backyard or straight to video instead of being in the theaters.

The story has holes so big, that makes you believe that half the script must have been stolen. The effects are made by someone dedicated to kill the genre. It's just one big mess.But what you do get, is a exposure. Although some characters are abused to no end, you get some eye candy. Meaning that the fights are rewarding and the sound track is delicious.It's simple. Yes, the movie is horrible. But this is the kind of you-know-what-you-get movie.

            "content": "Make no mistake about it, Mortal Kombat: Annihilation is an awful movie. But it's found its way in to my guilty pleasures collection. In spite of the terrible acting and dialog, it still has it's enjoyable parts. Perhaps it's awfulness contributes to that.The problem with MK:A is that it both tries too hard, and doesn't try hard enough. It doesn't try hard enough in regards to it's acting, dialog, or even character utilization. When I say the acting and dialog are bad, I mean it. To the point where I felt like Sindel's antagonistic dialog was ripped straight from a bad 1970's children's cartoon. I kind of felt embarrassed for the actors for having taken part in it.But it also tries too hard in regards to bringing every character from the Mortal Kombat series in to the film. When this film came out, Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 was the most current video game, and there were just under 20 characters or so that could be utilized. Well, this film decided to try its best to include almost all of them. Leaving out only Shang Tsung (due to the plot line of the first film), and two other characters whose off-screen deaths are addressed on-screen for closure. Because of this, a good deal of the characters are hardly utilized, some disappearing just as soon as they appear. Both Baraka and Noob Saibot literally have about 30 seconds of screen time each. Mileena and Smoke get a WHOPPING minute longer. Rain and Nightwolf don't have fights. What's the point? The focus of this film could have been much better had they sacrificed a good handful of characters for the greater good. Sure, I expect there to be more, but don't try to \"stay faithful\" to the game if it means sacrificing good character utilization.As well, they didn't really try to stay all that faithful to the game in regards to the plot anyhow. Having been a fan of the games for years, I don't ever recall Raiden, Shao Kahn, Mileena, and Shinnok all being related. I even checked online prior to this review (just to make sure that it wasn't retconned in to the story) and couldn't find it. This is just one problem with the entire plot, let alone the fact that Liu Kang's \"three tests\" turn out only to be two (maybe they were hoping we'd forget that there was supposed to be a third one). Sure, they got the main concept down. But unlike the first movie, they also veered a little too far off course.Is the plot itself terrible? It's average. About what I would expect for a generic action flick. Pretty flimsy in certain areas, that's for sure. But that's not even the worst of the problems of the movie. The execution is by far.It's such a noticeable dip from the first movie. Mortal Kombat was a solid outing. Not terrific, but pretty good. This movie made some attempts, but missed the mark greatly.MK: is an absolutely wretched movie. But it has some pretty entertaining (albeit cheesy) action. And perhaps it's B and C-rate elements make it entertaining as well. I can't recommend it without acknowledging that you will most likely be disappointed by it, regardless if you're an MK fan or not. It truly is a terrible film. I just can't help but find it entertaining in some regards.",

From the atrocious script, the questionable actors and horrible CGI this movie has. There is about as much complexity in the store as an adult movie.I have no idea why Raiden cuts his hair half way into the movie. He has the right voice to be the \"god of thunder\" but when he cuts his hair he has this almost Neil Patrick Harris look to him and I cannot take him seriously.Yes this movie is about a video game with nothing but fighting but the script is atrocious, it's like a movie called \"Fighting ace\" where 80-85% of the movie is fighting. I feel if the script is good or there was a balance we'd keep seeing them instead of cramming everyones favorite characters that the they played as in the rigged arcade machines in the 90s (this has been proven).I love the fact Johnny Cage is hardly in this movie as he was horrible. The worst actor in this has to be Jax. They made him way too ghetto. I don't know how else to describe him.The dialogue between everyone to Jade half way into the movie was it written by a 12 year old or was someone really into that woman who can barely act as if they got their girlfriend or someone in the movie just so they would sleep with them.The actor who plays Shao Kahn (Brian Thompson) is another hilariously awful actor in this movie. Yet for some reason. Sindel played by Musetta Vander everyone considers the worst in this movie for her iconic \"too bad.... YOU ... will die\". To that I say there are far worst lines out there. The only role I liked Brian in was the 1980s cult classic Cobra with Sylvester Stallone.The awful rave sounding techno rock music sounds awful, the CGI can get hilariously bad. Yes this movie is almost 30 years old but then again look at Terminator 2 and others from years prior.Although this movie had somewhat of a plot otherwise this would get a 1 star. I tried 3 times to finish it. I love so bad they are good movies but this was so terrible it should never have came out.",

I'm especially disappointed at the misuse of Special Effects. True, they were only a little \"better than Power Rangers\" in the first one but at least Anderson had the sense of not showing them off like this was before Terminator 2.

            "content": "What a hell? What a hell? What tha f**k?! OK, no sense to ask these redundant questions\u0085 let's skip to the movie\u0085 Well, first of all, I'll try, because\u0085 it hurts badly. Really this film manifest such a bad felling that thrust trough your eyes and then to your brain, and both hurts badly! The first Mortal Kombat (1995) is not the best film in the world, it's actually a pretty crappy film, but decent with some pretty cool and fair stuff, but compared to \"Annihilation\"\u0085 it's a freaking brilliant film. So, the story goes right where the first movie ended, which means that is generally based upon \"Mortal Kombat 2\" game, but they also put some characters from \"Mortal Kombat 3\" to make it more cool\u0085 but it does not work. So, Shao Khan, the great emperor of the Outworld and one of the toughest fighter ever, being almost a god-like creature, comes to the earth to stop mortals to enjoy their brief moment of rest and victory\u0085 what a prick. And, so\u0085 what else do you expect?! Our mortal good guys join their forces again to defeat Shao Khan. Otherwise\u0085 we wouldn't have the plot.Let's check out the acting/fighting/stuntman crew: Robin Shou returns to reprise the role of Liu Kang, he was pretty decent in the first film, although he can't act worth a sh*t\u0085 this film ultimately buried his career, just that he can end up later in other crap film \"Street Fighter \u2013 Legend of Chun Li\"\u0085 poor guy. Raiden is played by\u0085 by\u0085 what a? Who? Where is Christopher Lambert? Yeah\u0085 Lambert choose to do Beowulf (1999) instead, which was also a crappy film! Why, Christopher\u0085 Annihilation and Beowulf are crap films\u0085 but why did you pick the other one. I say this because he was good as Raiden, even with his wooden acting\u0085 but enough of this\u0085 stick to the film, stick to the review\u0085 you see? You see what happens? So, Raiden is played by James Remar, well Remar is not a bad actor\u0085 but the role of Raiden did not suited him, he was so uninterested with his role, he tries to look wise, but he all he does is walking around, staring at some little dot on the wall and deliver the lines without any emotions\u0085 damn\u0085 Oh, we got Sonya Blade here\u0085 played by\u0085 um\u0085 Sandra Hess? Well, to be honest\u0085 Hess was better than Bridgette Willson, she performed her own fights and stunts, being athletic and all, and even more hotter\u0085 but don't expect any acting from her at all. Johnny Cage is here too\u0085 played by\u0085 Chris Conrad? What the? OK\u0085 Now\u0085 the movie didn't even begin properly and they presented different actors who are playing two important characters in the story. Bridgette Willson and Linden Ashby were original actors to play Sonya and Cage, and they did it decently\u0085 but, now\u0085 you just have to, psychologically, get use to the new actors\u0085 that was unbearable. Well, at least they kept Talisa Soto as Kitana\u0085 but\u0085 she was even worse than in the first film. Delivering the lines, without any life in you doesn't make you interesting. Then, we have Shao Khan, played by Brian Thompson. Honestly\u0085 not a bad choice, he is pretty hulking, menacing, he has that deep, booming voice, and he also knows martial arts in real life, but\u0085 he can't act properly. In my opinion, he tried to deliver lines like a classically trained actor, but failed because of his retarded, silly tone. His fight scenes were decent, though. We also have Jax, played by Lynn Red Williams (a former American gladiator), who was used in the film as a comic relief to replace Johnny Cage\u0085 but no luck. Sindel is played by Musetta Vander, which delivers the most silliest lines in the film, combined to terrible acting\u0085 fail guaranteed. We also have Shinnok, played by Reiner Schoene\u0085 now that was the most unusual thing in the film\u0085 Shinnok sounded too German. Well, no wonder, the actor is German, but that was too\u0085 unusual, to silly, here comes Shinnok and I think \"I expect him to talk in some deep, powerful voice\u0085 \" but, remember the DVD, or VHS cover that says \"Destroy all Expectations\", that's the scene\u0085 after 10-15 minutes into the film\u0085 where my expectations were totally annihilated\u0085 for f**k sake\u0085 Then, we have Sheeva, played by Marjean Holden. Marjean looks pretty interesting in that bad suit, but her character was too much. We have Motaro played by Deron McBee, my Lord\u0085 have they ever seen Motaro? He is a lot bigger and more powerful than that\u0085 he was terrible. Irina Pantaeva played Jade. Irina is hot supermodel\u0085 but\u0085 isn't jade a black girl? While Irina is Eskimo? And her acting? Don't ask me\u0085 And finally, we have a brief appearance of Nightwolf\u0085 played by Litefoot, a terrible actor, they took him because he has Indian heritage\u0085 and he did poorly\u0085 although make up and costume department made him to look like Nightwolf as much as they can. And of course\u0085 we have Scorpion, Sub Zero, Reptile (again), Ermac and Rain as the new one and Noob Saibot for short moment also Smoke and Cyrax\u0085 martial artists who played these guys did a pretty good job, although their costumes were horrible. And Scorpion? What a hell, he appears, fights a little bit, than grabs Kitana and yells \"suckers\" and then disappears\u0085 what an a-hole. Sub Zero\u0085 well, that's not him\u0085 that was his brother\u0085 in the first film\u0085 well no matter. That's a big ninja clan, full of brothers and sisters\u0085 that's pretty much in the film\u0085which makes no sense at all, and makes story look more dumb.So\u0085 the entire movie is freakishly bad\u0085 you don't want to have anything with it\u0085 trust me. You can watch it with your friends and laugh your butts off",

It's that big guy with the impressive jaw who people kept trying to stab in the back on the neck on the X-Files...and he's in quasi Mad-Max football apocalypse gear. And he's a kung fu demon..or something. I was never really sure what the gist of the villains in mortal kombat was.But wait, there's more. Kung fu villain can destroy the world in like a week unless a handful of poor actors engage him in....a rousing game of Kerplunk. It's a sad fact this couldn't have made the movie worse and it could be argued that the action would have been better. But I digress.No, it's mortal kombat these sad sacks must engage in. The K means it's serious, none of that sissy C combat us losers engage in with the mailman, no sir.Who sets up the rules for such a competition, we can only guess. Personally, I don't see the logic in \"let's fight to the death or you all die\" but hey, I'm not a sugar addict video game designer who needs to be able to fit the plot of his game on the back of a business card.Who steps up to face the villainous X-Files clone? James Remar! Woot!Wait, who's James Remar? What, are you kidding? He's the guy who's almost as good as Christopher Lambert. Go ahead, read that again. He's Dolph Lundgren to Christopher Lambert's Schwartzenegger. Ike to his Tina. Lance Bass to his Justin Timberlake. Craig Kilborn to his Conan O'Brien. David Spade to his Chris Farley. Fox to his any network with class. You get the idea.But Remar as the Japanese god of thunder or lightning or white men isn't alone...no sir, he has B grade actors aplenty. Like..this one guy. And some woman. And a different woman. And a black man with silly metal arms. I mean..silly metal arms? When's the last time you saw a movie bursting at the seams with men wielding silly metal arms? Probably not lately.Keep an eye out for the villainous talking donkey, that guy's a hoot.I have to say, my favorite part of the film is that final climactic battle when the production team must have said something along the lines of \"wow, we drank all that tequila? I hope it doesn't ruin the movie\" and then leapt into the wild and zany world of computer animated monsters. I tell ya, when Liu Kang turns into a completely untextured, unrealistic, two dimensional, poorly colored and hopelessly preposterous sloth, or whatever it was, to fight that really angry platypus/aardvark that the other guy turned in to, I was riveted. Riveted I tell you! As though someone had driven long, wide stakes into my body so I could not leave the sofa. It was powerful film making. The very gravity of such a battle shook the cardboard sets to their foundations. And those silly metal arms probably shook a little too.If you're looking for a movie to watch tonight, and you find yourself thinking \"Christopher Lambert is just too good an actor for me to watch tonight, is there some substandard version of him out there?\" Then fella (or whatever the female equivalent of fella is) this movie's for you.

I had seen the original and I was going to see this too.I should have listened.Most fans will agree that the first Mortal Kombat movie could have been more darker. More violent, but at the end of the day, it wasn't horrible. It was cheesy. It entertained, but it worked. Seems someone at New Line Cinema took that to heart and felt obligated to release ... this.Let's be blunt. It's flat out awful. First sign of impending doom? Special effects that look like they're out of some college graphics art school project circa 1995. Plus a plot that I couldn't even make sense of or keep up with half the time. If you aren't familiar with Mortal Kombat trying to keep track of everybody and what's going on is a hard task. They throw around the fighters from MK3 so liberally you can't do anything more than identify them and then watch them either die or disappear pronto. What's the point!?I can only imagine what twelve year old kids with their butts in the movie theater seats felt like back in 1997. Pretty sore treatment. Yeah, there's numerous fight sequences, but they're so boring I bet even kids fell asleep during them. I'm still in a state of shock on the budget this film had. It's few redeeming features ... heck, it doesn't have any. Even an appearance from character actor Brian Thompson (Cobra, Lionheart, X-Files) can in no way, shape, or form ever get me to watch this movie again.What went wrong is so bloody (excuse the pun) simple. They should have never taken a violent video game and dumbed it down into a PG-13 kid friendly movie. Both the original and this sequel are guilty of this, but at least the original made sense. If you crave bad acting, awful special effects, a non-understandable plot line and characters that go by so fast you couldn't care less -- give Annihilation a go. Otherwise keep a wide berth.",

I remember at times says \"Excellent\" and \"Finish him\" and Flawless Victory.\" The action/fight sequences were very good if not Amazing at times.I do admit that i was sad to see some cast changes in this film. But James did a good job as Rayden especially in the fight scenes. I don't think Chris Lambert had the martial art skills need and James had to pull Rayden off in this film.Sandra Hess did a pretty good job as Sonya, but even i agree Brigdette was better in the role. In fact the only thing that disappointed me was the death of Johnny Cage at the start of film.rumor has it that this character will be brought back to life in Mortal Kombat 3. If they every make it that is. What i really found to be amazing was the Animality sequences of the film. they were truly incredible.unfortunately most people try and Judge this film against Mortal Komabat 1 and you just can't do that. An example of this is Grease and Grease 2. you can't judge these film together as they are both differn't and yet both very good films.I never judge a sequel by it's predecessor, I judged this film as a stand alone film and it does stand alone very well.

To be honest it's a giant slap in the face to the first movie in pretty much every way.The cgi is bad on the level of foodfight, and unfortunately almost the entire cast has been replaced.

'Why did that happen?' 'Wait, did someone just turn 2D and get folded up like paper Mario?' Seriously, the plot was bafflingly random and nonsensical.I will say though, it is a very funny movie with a lot of memorable moments and quotable lines, although maybe for all the wrong reasons. But still, I can't say I didn't have some fun while watching, but it would definitely have been more fun if they kept the original cast. Especially Raiden. 2.9/10.",

            "content": "While I didn't think the first film was fantastic, it was enjoyable and seemed to go at a more decent pace and a plot that at least was able to hold itself together through the whole way. The good thing was that it focused on three main central characters.In MKA, it puts too many characters altogether, some making appearances then getting wiped out with no dramatic effect. Take Sheeva for example who is one of the most intriguing characters in the game - her demise was so laughable and stupid there was really no point putting her in the film. What a waste!I thought Sindel wasn't too bad, but with her bad dialogue, it was quite ridiculous in many ways. She didn't feel much like a fighter, especially with the fight with Kitana at the end - Kitana could have knocked her down in a second - horrible choreography.Why did they make Jade a traitor? I thought she was one of the good characters in the game, not a traitor. And what's more - why didn't they make her character black? She is not Asian! I think they just wanted to bring some chemistry between her and Liu Kang but hey it didn't work!The visual effects seemed more obvious and cheesy than in the first and a lot of the cast are replaced by new actors. James Remar does not make an interesting Raiden nor a worthy one that is worthy of being feared or respected as the Thunder God. I didn't mind the new actress who played Sonja but the original had more toughness and attitude in her performance. The way Sonja was portrayed made her a bit more softer than fierce - Bridgett Wilson just kicked ass all the way.Acting wise, it's pretty flat and it doesn't help with some corny lines. Kitana and Sindel get some of the funniest lines 'My mother's dead....'as soon will be her daughter!' Overall, the film feels like it's going in too many directions, introducing new characters out of nowhere and not really drawing you into this world. Talisa Soto seems to have the same expression on her face most of the time and really fell flat in this one whereas in the original she seems like she was enjoying herself a bit more.Oh and the ending was so cheesy - how they all walk off hand in hand arms around each other. I think they could have made it a bit more...dramatic. I mean the first one's ending was similar but it seemed to have more of a punch.If you can overlook a lot of its faults, you'll have a fairly amusing time with this but in the end you'll be wondering how they managed to make this really uninspiring or suspenseful for a story that is meant to be about saving the world.",

For no reason at all, Liu Kang spontaneously transforms into a giant dragon and fights Shao Kahn who also spontaneously transforms into a giant dragon. This scene was the most ridiculous display of cinema I have ever witnessed in my life. The rest of the movie was only terrible, but the ending topped of the movie so perfectly to the point of wanting to slam my head in the T.V. to stop watching. The bad acting and pointless martial arts wasn't enough. They had to bring a couple of massive dragons to fight as though they were from a much earlier Godzilla movie to finish off a terrible movie.I know that this does not seem much like a review, in fact it is much closer to just a ramble of my warnings but it is near impossible to give a review for a movie that I could very well consider one of the worst movies of all time.

The staging is so terrible, you probably won't see it in a high school play. It leaves you with the impression that the \"long journey\" is actually happening in a two-bedroom house. The special effects are pathetic and you can actually see the faults in something as simple as shades. Some of the fight scenes are obviously taken in front of a green screen. The acting is beyond tragic. No shocks here as nobody would expect the cast to actually act something that has no purpose and is not really going anywhere. Some of the lines are like written by a 9 year old on two beers. Tens of new characters are presented without any history or connection to anybody or anything. If all that wasn't enough, the director seems like he took a day off as some scenes include awkward pieces of body parts being focused on while the character is saying something. If there was a nomination for the worse 10+ million dollar movie in history, this one will get it for sure!",

That being said, there are definitely parts where the writing gets sloppy, especially with new entries and prior characterization established in the 1st movie.

Bridgette Wilson, Christopher Lambert and I think they replaced Johnny Cage too.I like how they brought Brian Thompson and Litefoot in to play Shao Khan and Nightwolf and the rest of the new cast to play the characters weren't so bad, but the story was dreadful.Don't get me wrong, the action scenes are great but the overall plot is confusing. Suppose the merger did take place, what happened to all the human beings? There are what 6 billion people on earth and the only ones wandering around the merger are the warriors? The extermination squads couldn't even wipe out Jax and Sonya how could they take out 6 BILLION others? The animality scene was also a little far-fetched but that was from the game so no real damage there.I guess I couldn't get over the transition from Chistopher Lambert playing Rayden to the guy who played Ajax in The Warriors playing Rayden. Then again the loss of bad ass hottie Bridgette Wilson didn't help matters either.Decent action but the dumb plot and the replaced characters made this movie a huge let-down from the first movie 5 out of 10",

Well, that's not what worked about it...what worked was, Lambert played his part comically, stuffed with sarcastic remarks and one-liners. Lambert didn't take the role seriously, and therefore, since the major star wasn't taking the movie seriously, the viewer didn't feel obligated to either, and one would just looked at the film as a fun little, circus of a picture. While many don't like Lambert, I feel he at least made the first picture work in his choice to play Rayden the Thunder God with a comical tone. This new guy, however, abandons the humor and takes the part a little too seriously. As a result, the film takes itself too seriously and falls flat.There's really not much difference between this one and the first film. Same basic idea. Same flat characters (for a fighting movie, though, that's acceptable). Some far-fetched fighting scenes. But the first film didn't take itself seriously, thanks to Lambert. This one does, and as a result, it is unintentionally hilarious. Good set designs, though.*1/2 out of ****",

You see, the worse the movie, the more fun it is to write a review of it.  And, man, is this going to be fun.First off, let's get straight to it.  This movie has no plot.  None, not there, period.  Basically, the movie is about a guy who goes around and fights strange people at random.  He fights one person, kills them, then moves on to the next person.  Some of these fights are a little \"cool\" but believe me, you can't enjoy this movie unless you're under 12, or very, VERY stoned.I laugh every time I think of this movie.  Everything about it is bad.  It's so bad I'm laughing as I type. HA HA HA!  The sad thing is, the movie would be decent if the special effects were worth watching, but they're not. They're bad!  Bad as hell!  HA!  Not to mention the kung fu, which should be good considering this is the only thing in the damn movie, IS BAD TOO!  CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT!  Whoever mad this movie is unemployed now.Well, bad movies usually can be fun.  So is this movie fun? No.  The movie's biggest problem is the minute you meet a character, they go away, never to be seen again.  Of the, ummm, 40 or so characters in this movie, only about 5 of them are actually important. Some of my lower intelligent friends have said the movie is bad but still (and I quote here) \"Kicks Ass!\".  Well, I've seen some K.A. movies in my day, and this isn't one of them.  If you want a kung fu, special effects action spectacular, rent the first Mortal Kombat.  I believe that the first one is probably the best game-to-film movie around.  Though that's not really saying much, because that movie was bad too.  But at least it had a plot, good special effects, good kung fu, and characters you actually cared about.  Mortal Kombat 2 is probably one of the worst game-to-film movies I've ever seen, mainly because it follows the game TOO well.  All the game had was fighting.  Strange, because that's all the movie has too!  It's right up there with Super Mario Brothers! HA!  Now that's funny my friend!

Being a big gamer and a fan of the Mortal Kombat videogames, I always wondered what the movies were like (I watched it in the wrong order so I'm reviewing the second and then the first) and this has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I don't even know how it got released! Shao Khan, the Emperor of the Outworld, has opened the portal between the realm and Earth. If it remains open on the seventh day, all of mankind shall be destroyed. Now the Lightning God Rayden and four fighters- Liu Kang, Sonya Blade, Princess Kitana and Jax, have six days to find a way to close the portal and save the Earth, battling the evil forces of the Outworld along the way.This film is pretty much the meaning of the word 'awful'. The story is average but in places, it is so boring and predictable that watching paint dry seems entertaining. The first movie had the tournament but without the tournament in the sequel, the makers of the movie had to find some way and some reason to make one-on-one combat scenes\u0085and unfortunately came up with this. Each character goes off on their own path and each fighter just happens to have a bad guy each so they can involve fight scenes. Pretty weak. Most of the acting is quite abysmal. The heroes are below average except for Sandra Hess who was great as Sonya but I can't say the same for the villains.The special effects looked like they were made by a toddler with no effort or thought involved whatsoever. The action sequences were unrealistic and executed quite poorly, it just reminded me of Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers (actually, Power Rangers had more believable fight sequences than Annihilation and that's no joke). The direction and editing of the movie was poor and the ending wasn't good either. The characters were a laughing stock and I could not care less for any of them\u0085except maybe for Sonya but not for the rest. All in all, avoid, avoid, AVOID! Fans of the game might like this sequel but I just didn't see the fascination, the first is better by far and this should never have been released. A recipe for disaster!

I thought it was an entertaining film with a decent cast, sharp action scenes and special effects, and the movie paid respectful attention to its source material.MK Annihilation is anything but a good film.  It comes off like a bad Power Rangers episode, with most of the original actors gone, goofy camera angles and zoom shots, no story and pathetic special effects.  \"Animality\"?  Please.  I've seen better stuff out of old \"Gamera\" movies.  This movie introduced almost every character from Mortal Kombat Trilogy only to kill them off five seconds after their debut.  What's the point of that other than to say that \"this character\" was in the movie? All it accomplished was bogging down what little plot there is.  The story itself (based off MK3 and MK4), was shaky, the techno music was nowhere near as good as the first film, and the whole movie seemed uneven and a waste of film.  It lacked the feel of a movie, and earned the second 1997 award of a \"film that I almost walked out of in the first fifteen minutes.\"I've talked to more than a fair share of people who have said this movie is \"wonderful\".  Of course, all of these people were die-hard MK fans who feel that anything with the famous dragon logo can do no wrong.Want a Mortal Kombat movie to watch?  Watch the first film.  At least that one is a fun movie to sit through and enjoy.  Too bad MK:A didn't live up to the first one.  The line \"Pretty cool, huh?

This movie is a feature length, non-interactive computer game. Only most computer games have better scripts. Okay, that's a little harsh ... some computer games have better scripts. I was prepared enjoy this movie, but that wasn't helped by the fact that Johnny Cage, the most interesting character from the original, is killed off in the first five minutes. The little kid in me screamed \"How dare they!\" when that happened.We have a few new characters introduced ... there's a black guy with steel arms, some Chinese chick, another girl with four arms, and scorpion and sub zero's brothers pop in for quick visit too. The big baddie, Khan, is played by Brian Thompson who you'll probably recognised as the alien bounty hunter from the X-files, various roles on Buffy, a role on the TV series \"Werewolf\", or various other cult appearances.

They had the depth, they had the cast, they had the music and they had the sets to make us believe that the movies had the magic to tell the story as effectively as a video game like Mortal Kombat could. There was nothing in it that I would say was done wrong and could have been done better. I was forced to give it a ten out of ten for the simple reason that the movie was challenging to make and lived up to all the challenges. But here is a sequel that I really don't know what exactly to say and I decided that I should just give it something less than five. Mortal Kombat 2 retains some of the cast that made Mortal Kombat 1 a good movie but fails to portray them in right light. We do not understand these characters. They do not have anything defining in them which makes you identify with them and understand their lives. You have some lame plot of a Shao Khan who wants to rule the earth and has broken a sacred rule to do so. You have really silly fights. You have a Jax with some weird arms that he himself cannot use. You have a new Sonya Blade who simply is not the ruthless and determined gal we saw in the first part. And Raiden, my God, is his role weird?Overall, the movie appears to have been made for the sake of making it. No attention paid to the plot, not so well choreographed fights. Too many characters and bad fights. They could have gone for limited but more furious fights. The end battle is the worst imaginable. Very 'cartoonish' looking sets and graphics. Overall, the story itself is childish. Mortal Kombat could show a fight without appearing childish and yet not appearing violent. Mortal Kombat 2 fails to keep the balance and most of the fights appear childish. The movie cannot be enjoyed so much. A better plot, limited characters and better fight sequences could have saved the day.",

            "review_title": "Possibly The Worst Sequel Ever Made...",
            "content": "After the amazing success of the first \"Mortal Kombat\" film in 1995, a sequel was virtually guaranteed. The original made a whopping $122 million on an $18 million budget, with a talented cast of actors and martial artists, plus some expert VFX work.Sadly, this film truly dropped the ball from square one. To start off, only three actors from the first film returned: Robin Shou, Keith Cooke, and Talisa Soto. Christopher Lambert, Linden Ashby, Bridgette Wilson, and director Paul Anderson were all asked to come back, but refused. That should've been the end of it, but no...those idiots in Hollywood will truly do anything to make a buck. \"Annihilation\" quickly went from anticipated to despised, making just $51 million on a $30 million budget.So, what was the main problem? In all honesty, there wasn't just one. Anderson, Lambert, Wilson, and Ashby's departures were just the beginning, like a snowball getting bigger as it rolls downhill. The movie had far too many characters, most of which weren't needed, and some even went unnamed in dialogue. The whole project had zero seriousness about it, unlike the dark mystery of the original effort.The story (if anyone could call it that) is as follows: Outworld emperor Shao Kahn invades the Earth, resurrecting Kitana's dead mother Sindel to use as a pawn in merging Earth with Outworld. The few who survive have a grand total of six days before the merger completes, killing everyone on the planet...hence the film's title.The massively-overcrowded cast of characters includes the following: Liu Kang, Johnny Cage, Sonya Blade, Kitana, Mileena, Rayden, Shao Kahn, Sindel, Jade, Baraka, Cyrax, Smoke, Jax, Motaro, Sheeva, Rain, Ermac, Noob Saibot, Nightwolf, Shinnok, Scorpion, and a second version of Sub-Zero. The characters of Kabal and Stryker are mentioned, but remain unseen. Of all those, the only ones with major screen time are Liu, Sonya, Jax, Kahn, Shinnok, and Rayden. Johnny Cage is killed by Kahn a few minutes into the film, briefly played by Chris Conrad. Sandra Hess replaces Bridgette Wilson as Sonya, while James Remar fills in as Rayden. Jax is portrayed by former American Gladiators star Lynn \"Red\" Williams.There's so many inconsistencies with this movie, too. Its like the writers just crammed everything they could think of into the same film, not giving a damn whether it made any sense. Kahn and Rayden are portrayed as estranged brothers, with Shinnok as their father (no, I'm not kidding). Sonya's famous \"kiss of death\" is reduced to her blowing flammable powder onto an already-engulfed Cyrax, while all the ninja costumes look like cheap cosplay attempts. Motaro and Sheeva look worse than B-movie rejects, and bicker like this film's version of \"The Odd Couple\". The \"animalities\" from the third video game make an appearance, but the result is cheesy beyond belief with Liu Kang and Shao Kahn turning into warring \"Godzilla\" ripoffs. Sonya gets cornered at one point by Ermac, only to have Noob Saibot literally ooze like oil from his chest to reform behind Sonya for a two-against one fight.The only saving grace with this entry are the performances of Robin Shou, Talisa Soto, Sandra Hess, and Lynn Williams, who all do their best while the movie falls apart around them. If you value your sanity, stick with the original film; this one's only worth a $1 rental if you're extremely bored.",

            "review_title": "Let down",
            "content": "I saw the first Mortal Kombat film; I knew a sequel was to be made, as the way the first film ended. I was happy on how well the first movie was, as most (mainly 90% +) movies based on video games, are very bad. I saw the second movie, and well I was more let down by how bad it was. Basically this film starts off, where the first film ended, with Shao Kahn coming to Earth realm and having a plot to take over Earth in 6 days. You are also giving a quick review at the beginning of what happened in the previous movie. When the movie starts \"after the review of the last film\", you will notice right off the bat, that most of the characters are played by different people. Johnny Cage is now played by Chris Conrad, instead of Linden Ashby (which I'm guessing probably seeing the script and seeing what happens to his character, he chose not be in this film). Sonya is now played by Sandra Hess instead of Bridgette Wilson. Lord Rayden is now played by James Remar instead of Christopher Lambert (who was committed to another film, thus could not be in the film). There are two initial problems with this film. The first problem being miscasting, and the second problem is not explaining/having too many characters in the film. So the first problem with this movie is miscasting. Sandra Hess may have had the looks to be Sonya, but did not having the acting skills to become the character of Sonya as Bridgette Wilson did. James Remar being Rayden. That had to be the biggest let down of them all in this movie. When Christopher Lambert portrayed Rayden, he WAS Rayden. Christopher Lambert hit the nail on the head, as I could see him being Rayden. James Remar fell very short of being Rayden. James made Rayden seem less like of a god to me, and just was one of the biggest let downs in the movie. The second problem in this film would be the amount none explaining/having too many characters in the film. A film can be a great movie with a lot of characters in it, if those are explained why they are there and their purpose. Even if it's a six second description of why they are there and who they are, that will work for me. This film fails to grasp that concept in a few ways. There are a lot of characters in this movie, but it is not explained why they are there in the first place or who they are if you don't already know who they are. One example of this would be Rain, who is like only seen for a few minutes in the film, and then meets his fate for his actions. Another example of this would be when Mileena attacks Sonya. Again it's not explained who she (Mileena) is and why she is here. There are other areas in the film, that this occurs, but I do not want to ruin any more of the film for you. This movie did have some good points to it. The fight scenes were well done, and gave an impression that the combat and fighting was real. Robin Shou and Talisa Soto reprise their roles of Liu Kang and Princess Kitana, which both do a good job of being their respective character. So looking at this film, the two big things that didn't make this movie good as the first film, was miscasting and having too many characters and no story behind certain characters. Although at times, the recast can be better for a certain role, it does not always make the character seem better. In the case of Sony and Rayden, the miscast only hampered the roles that they played. Having too many characters in a film and not have them properly explained can also hamper a film. With the appearance of Rain and Mileena in this film, neither character is explained why they are there, and thus we are thinking either during the film or after \"Who was that character or what their point of being in the film was\". Also by the fact that some characters are not explained who they are, people who have never seen the first Mortal Kombat movie, nor have played any of the games (Mortal Kombat II and up), may be confused by who some of these characters are. Unless you are in the mood for a bad film, or are either drunk and/or high avoid this film. Trust me, you won't regret it.",

I liked the bigger array of characters but thought it was stupid that hardly any of them were mentioned by name or had a maximum screen time of 5 minutes and the \"animality\" nonsense at the end was silly.  The acting is rather subpar, as if anyone who saw it couldn't guess that already.  I did enjoy the music though and promptly picked up the soundtrack.

In this movie Liu Kang is the hero in white, without the personal demons he had to face in the first. The fights are spectacular and quite enjoyable.

            "content": "Mortal Kombat: Annihilation could have easily made the franchise into a successful trilogy of movies, but as the tagline implies, this movie destroyed all expectations.Everything that worked in the first movie is absent here. The majority of returning characters are portrayed by new actors (with the exceptions of Robin Shou as Liu Kang, and Talisa Soto as Kitana). It also doesn't help that the acting this time around is terrible as everyone's performances range from stale (James Remar as Rayden) to over the top (Brian Thompson as Shao Kahn).The script is riddled with plot holes, and comes off as nonsensical. The movie also follows a simple pattern; fighting, running, talking, and it goes on throughout the entire run time of the movie.There is a lack of character development as the movie attempts to cram in as many characters from the more popular games in the Mortal Kombat franchise (mainly Mortal Kombat II and MK3), and the majority of them have limited screen-time as they either get killed off, or disappear after their 1 scene.Of course, we have to take a look at the action, but the fight scenes are pretty lackluster this time around. We had some impressive stuff choreography-wise in the first movie, but all of the fight scenes here feel rushed.There's an overabundance of special effects in the movie, and yet, every single one of them look terrible, even for 1997. Supposedly, this movie had a bigger budget than the first movie, and yet, it looks nowhere near as impressive. Production and cinematography- wise, the whole movie looks and feels like a cheap straight-to-video sequel rushed out to capitalize on the success of the first movie.Mortal Kombat: Annihilation suffers the same problems as the majority of the other movies based on video games, it didn't feel like they tried to make a proper movie based on the game, but instead a product that tries shoehorning references to said game in a way that feels gimmicky, but as far as the genre goes, this stands as the worst film of the genre for being a colossal disappointment following its entertaining and well made predecessor, and a prime example of shoddy filmmaking (so much that it almost rivals anything directed by Uwe Boll). Do yourself a favor, stick to the first movie and the video games, avoid this stinker.",

Where MK1 took the time to introduce you to the characters and submerge you in the world, MKA picks up from the end of the first movie and just throws a whole bunch of stuff against the wall.Rain, Sheeva, Noob Saibot, Mileena, Smoke, Cyrax, Sub-Zero, Scorpion and Baraka all make completely unnecessary cameos that cripple their ability to actually play out their storylines in any future sequels. Raynor Scheine is a weak Shinnok, another character who just seems forced into the story. Nightwolf is a character with promise, and indeed, he does- promises to teach Liu Kang three things. Instead, he chucks an axe at Liu's head and teaches him nothing.Sandra Hess takes over Bridgette Wilson's role as Sonya, but fails to give the requisite attitude needed to win over the audience. We don't believe her connection to Cage, who is not only replaced by another actor, but killed off altogether within the first five minutes completely unceremoniously.James Remar is laughably weak as Raiden, a role which veteran actor Christopher Lambert previously completely owned. His performance is bland and uninspired, and the jokes seem forced. Brian Thompson gives a cringingly bad interpretation of Shao Kahn, the \"super villain\" who's afraid of his own father and leaves the audience wondering if he was really suppoed to be all that bad. John Medlen's Ermac is silent and unimportant, and Deron McBee's Motaro is a completely two dimensional character.Meanwhile, original cast members Robin Shou and Talisa Soto act emotionlessly and without gusto, something definitely not lacking in their earlier performance.Some of the bright spots in the film come courtesy of newcomers Lynn Williams, Musetta Vander, and Irina Pantaeva, who do surprisingly good jobs as Jax, Sindel, and Jade, respectively, though Pantaeva's character is disposed of at completely the wrong time.The movie is cheap, and cut corners, including Baraka's supposed death scene, which is just a repeat of Rain being knocked into the fire, and the cheap animalities that closed the movie, which are infamously the worst feature of an awful movie. Overall, one is left with the sense that the producers didn't care about the characters of the Mortal Kombat universe, which the first movie definitely left you satisfied.So, overall, I give it an 8/10. Why?It's so bad, it's good.It's the kind of movie you sit down and laugh your ass off at. Not because it's a comedy, but because it's so bad, that it's genuinely entertaining.So, if you can put aside the fact that the premise for a possibly good sequel was butchered by bad acting, bad effects, too many characters, needless deaths, and cheap production, it's a fantastic flick to watch with your friends if you're in the mood for what will soon be a cult classic.",

The story was rather complex but failed due to the weak acting and special effects. Also if your gonna have an animality in a film, why not let them turn into animals instead of f**ked up monsters that look so fake its not funny. I really hope the ten year gap between this movie and devastation allows MK Devastation to be a much better movie. Also bring in some brutalities and fatalities and i will be very pleased indeed. However avoid this piece of tripe at all costs. Even on the interviews with the director it cuts out while hes gonna say something. My god this movie was awful and poorly put together. The only two good things about it were the MK theme at the beginning and Jax (he was really funny and a great character).

The only value of this movie is serving as a torture device, or as a device for a drinking game based on pointing out the stupid things in the movie and drinking a shot, which in about fifteen minutes will end up in everyone being dead drunk.1/10",

It's about a game with too many characters, unwieldy fighting mechanics, and a 'plot' that is simply an excuse for the characters to beat up on each other.  So, in other words, MK: Annihilation is a perfect adaptation of MK3:Ultimate Turbo Spaz Fighting or whatever the final sequel of that one they came out with was.Don't try to follow the storyline.  As far as I could tell, these 3-5 people who seem to be the main good guys (Rayden, Liu Kang, Sonya, Jax, Kitana) walk around randomly and fight random people, for little to no reason at all.  They're supposed to be building up an army and building their skills or something, but that never happens.  In fact, Liu Kang just magically gets his skillz back before fighting Mr. Evil Man for no reason also-after having spent most of the film getting beat up by everyone and their second cousin. I think even I could have a good chance of giving this yutz a beatdown, as directed.Don't try to follow all the characters.  MK:A tries to force in EVERY SINGLE OBSCURE CHARACTER that's ever been in these games, which I guess may be good if you're initiated.  Otherwise, you won't give a Motaro's tail about anyone.  I suppose even Boon Saibot was in there somewhere-and Stryker (the dopey-cop who only I ever played in the game) even gets a mention.  You'll just throw up your hands in the first 15 minutes, and give up on these people.Don't count on the effects or the fighting to save you either, because both are woefully poor.  Your best bet for entertainment is to try to count the plot holes.  I myself lost track.  They build characters and points up, never to use them again.  Oh well.  It's a great bad movie night flick, but don't expect any more.  It could probably be a great drinking game, too. Take a shot whenever a new character is brought in, and if you're not wasted by the end, well, you probably turned it off already.",

You could say that they wanted to cash in on Mortal Kombat's popularity.  I really don't know what could have saved this film.  Maybe if they'd waited... I have to agree with many fans who said it was a rush job.  Never judge a film by its trailer.  I was under the impression that it was going to be the best movie ever.  Sheesh.  It starts out explaining the first one a bit and jumps into this one.  But just about EVERYTHING changed at that point.  Kitana and Liu Kang were the only ones left and their acting was awful.  I mean come on.. I KNOW Robin can do better than that... just look at the first film.  I really don't think he was satisfied with it.

This is coming from a person who has only played the 1st MK game that ever came out. The plot is easy to follow and basic which I like. I can't think of a movie like this having some complicated plot that requires the use of a pad of paper and pencil to take down notes. Basically the plot is about a guy named Shal Kahn who opens the portals from his world called outworld to Earth. Rayden the thunder god gathers a bunch of supposely best fighters in the world. Each has there own thing to do. The character JAX and Sonya do nothing but fight various people that come upon and go flying 10 meters away when hit. JJ Perry's stunts as Scorpion and Cyrax were pretty decent if not good. The fight scenes were unorganized and sort of hard to follow. Using a million different cameras they were able to make the fights look faster which was good. Fight scenes aren't usually hard to follow but in the team fight with Jax and Sonya they kept on switching fights every 2 seconds where they fought Cyrax and a bunch of Ninjas. Special effects were decent. Obvisouly you could tell the last fight between Liu Kang and Shal Kahn was computerized as they turned into there animalities. The fights were a bit overdone. Jax pushing a metal platform at Cyrax and Cyrax for some reason finds the need to almost a 360 degree flip in mid air (showed in slow motion). Alot of the falls were over done. Lots of fighters flying off of platforms onto padding you can't see. Must of had alot of medical technicans near by just in case during the filming. Explosions were used frequently. In the fight between Smoke and Liu Kang Smoke goes flying down a hole in the ground and a extremely stage looking controlled explosion errupted naturally showing Sub Zero covering his face as a stuntman does when an explosion occurs. The editors did there best to make the special effects pyro and actual stunts work together but you could really tell what was being used at the time to make the scenes look more exciting. Can you please tell me why Shal Kahn and Rayden needed to fly through the air to get to each other to talk? Just another example of something used to cover up a boring part. that \"bow to me\" line sounded unconvincing and something that came out of a school stage production. Overall I did enjoy this film and have it on video. If you just forget about the minors glitches its a excellent film for people who like overdone martial arts action. :)",

The special effect were kinda cheap and cheesy... correction they ARE cheap and cheesy.The story development was nearly non-existent, how Kahn was able to merge the realms, and when they did bring up the plot it was the same point over, and over again, which was Queen Sindel is the key to all of this, and that is it, they also fail to mention things like, How Scorpion came back from the dead, why their are Robot ninjas, I know the answers cause I played the games, but for the casual viewer they won't know.They tried to fit more into this movie then there was in the first one, and yet they cut the run time shorter than the first movie. They also tried to give fans \"what they wanted\" by putting a fight with Scorpion and Sub-Zero in the movie... but it was a best a minute long, and really lame... the match between Scorpion and Cage was better. And they mention Kombatants from the game and never even show them, and guess spot the some,like Nightwolf is in the movie for a solid 3 minutes, they show Noob Saibot but he appears as part of Ermac and no one realizes he is a separate character (in reality he is the original Sub-Zero returned from the dead as a wraith), Mileena appears for mud wrestling match with Sonya only to be beaten in like a minute. Cyrax and Smoke pop up out of nowhere and are easily dispatched. Also Storyline wise regarding the games, they when from Mortal Kombat to Mortal Kombat 3, skipping the second game and cutting out the introduction and character building for some characters, I know they used some of the elements from MKII in the first movie, but the second movie just bypasses Shao Kahn's tournament and goes straight to his invasion. Mortal Kombat and MK: Conquest are much better to watch than this movie. The only positive in the movie was the costumes for Smoke and Cyrax were dead on.",

Of course the first movie didn't follow the original story much at all aside from a few nods, it was a decent action movie that left plenty of room for a promising sequel. MKA is an atrocious piece if work, however, and I would've rated it lower had I not wanted to like this film due to its vast (yet ultimately unrealized) scope and its (rather pathetic) attempt at integrating much of the storyline from MK2 and MK3 (along with a mutated and ineffectual pinch of MK4 - \"Raiden, I am your father!\" said Shinnok.)One major flaw is the sharp decline in acting quality. The first film featured some rather austere performances, but they were punctuated with bits of humor and as much emotion and likability one could expect. Only 2 actors return to MKA and neither are given much of a chance to act due to the endless fights and near complete lack of exposition. The rest of the cast alternates between cheesed out stereotypes and the brainlessly bland. Remar gives an exceptionally terrible performance as Raiden. Instead of the witty, mysterious, and sarcastic god given to us by Lambert, we have a puny weakling who tries to utter profound wisdom to our warriors but generally spits out complete nonsense. And when he's not doing that, he's giving out preschool-level speeches about love and unity and inner strength. Lets not forget the villains that speak with such pomp and bombast that they sound like a 13 year old level 27 dungeon lord of the 5th plane of the abyss.Of course the script is equally to blame. None of the dialog even remotely resembles human speech. I do sort of like how some story elements are used, but the problem is that they play no role in the central plot because that is one thing the writers totally ignores and destroyed. The games take place in such a rich mythology that I can't understand the need for hacking it up so badly. We have a huge number of characters with zero relevance, and big bad Shao Khan was a huge misfire. It's just some bulked up moron, no resemblance to the accomplished warrior, cunning sorcerer, seasoned general, and mysterious god-like being from the games. He's just a goon with other goons absent any clear motivation.I could forgive the murder of the storyline had a compelling film been made but its too full of nonsense to think of anything other than how it might've been made better by the inclusion of key plot points out of the games. It's fun to see characters I love come to life but equally disturbing to see such egregious mistreatment. MKA fails to honor its source and perhaps more importantly fails at being a coherent film. Most of it is one brainless fight after another with zero explanation or context interspersed with Raiden's infantile musings on hope and humanity and atrocities like the animality or, for instance, whenever any character speaks to another. Beloved combatants pop in and out of the film, while others exist only to die unceremoniously, there are far too many maniacal laughs from villains and the good guys are so wooden that you'll be wishing you'd been the victim of a gruesome fatality by the time MKA is over.\"I've seen that tattoo before, on a robot.\"",

Literally within the first 5 minutes of the movie the much loved comic relief from the first movie ''Johnny Cage'' gets into an altercation with Sho-Kahn ''Evil Bad Guy'' in which Sho-Kahn gets the upper hand and after a few tense moments snaps Johnny Cage's neck effectively killing his character out of the movie. It makes no sense than Johnny Cage, The man who single handily defeated Scorpion and Goro ''Two very tough Mortal Kombat opponents'' in the first movie, is so feebly destroyed in the second movie.The movie only goes down hill from there. The fights are stupid and Power Ranger Esq, the acting is sub-par...Even by bad acting standards. This film is also victim of a major cast overhaul...And not for the better. Most likely because the original cast read the pathetic script and said no way am I going to be in this piece of crap movie! And lets not forget the TERRIBLE CGI used in this movie...One of the downsides to the first MK movie was the weak CGI...But MKA takes weak CGI to a whole new level of bad.Overall this movie was SO bad...I wish that I could go back in time to 1996 and save my mom the money it cost to buy two movie tickets for this crap movie AND save her from the offal boredom she must have felt sitting threw this embarrassingly bad piece of trash movie.As far as I am concerned the story of Mortal Kombat ended with the first movie. MKA does not even exists to me.",

            "content": "I think this movie was OK, I've noticed several other comments, and I'll break it down with each character in the movie: Johnny Cage - His shadow kick in the 2nd movie was pretty cool, but he got gypped when the writers decided to kill him and get him out of the movie.Liu Kang - Excellent Portrayal of the character, he did his fireball movie in MK1, and His Animality in MK2, which was pretty cool.Kitana - Same ol Hottie in this flick, Talisa played a perfect role, and geez she was HOT!! WOO!!! She used her Fan in this movie, but would've been cool if she actually threw it, like in the games.Sonya - While Brigette Wilson played a good role with her character, they changed it to some other chick, and she was eh OK.Jax - Awesome dude, Pretty cool arms too, until motaro ripped em off, then he was a wuss, a wuss that beat him. :-D Jade - her weapon didn't match the same weapon she used in the game, in the movie, she used a spear, while in the game, she used a bo staff.Cyrax - Almost perfect portrayal of the character in the game, except when he fired those little balls that forms a nest, instead of capturing the player and bring them towards him, they go all over the poor sucker and starts consuming them until their existence is gone, from body to vapor, Yes they even consume the victim's bones.Smoke - Horrible portrayal of the character, he appears by a cloud of smoke which was OK, but fires a missile!? UH UH, NO WAY, he doesn't fire missile in ANY of the games, he fires a 3 prong spear, Scorpion-style, and only throws those little cyrax-style bombs like in his fatality move. I wasn't too happy with that part. We all know that smoke doesn't fire missiles, SEKTOR DOES!!! Scorpion - 2 Spears from 1 hand!? come on now! Why did he return when johnny cage beat him in the 1st movie. *shrugs* SubZero - Awesome dood, does his replication move, and throws ice perfectly, I was impressed.Rayden - He was OK, just Christopher Lambert Would've been a better person than the new dood in the 2nd movie.Milleena - She looked perfect, Has the Sais, just didn't do her roll move, or her teleport move.Noob Saibot - Yes he was in this movie, not only 1, but 3 when the group was about to face Sindel, 3 ninjas crawled on the wall and appeared Ermac - Wished I could see him in battle, instead he was trying to get elected a General after Shao Khan killed Rain.Shao Kahn - Pretty good portrayal of the game's Character, except no one saw his Animality in the game.Shinnok - he got PWND by the elder gods and he didn't do much in the movie.Sheeva - She was OK, just her stomp move wasn't used in the movie.Motaro - Nicely done Computer Generated Character with this guy that acted him out, perfect combination.Sindel - Her Scream was pretty cool, and her hair move was OK.Overall, this movie gets a 5 for effort and near accuracy of the game. I like both of them, and can't wait for a 3rd one if they plan to have it done, I doubt it, but would surprise me if they actually did.",

In truth, I had actually gone with a friend who was big into the whole Mortal Kombat series.  And just for being a nice friend, I was treated to a movie of unspeakable wretchedness.  I absolutely hated that flick -- perhaps the longest hour and a half of my life.  And that's when I was a teenager, still possibly vulnerable to movies like this.Well, if I hated it then, you can imagine how much I hated it this time around.  It's about 90 minutes of non-stop hackneyed fighting, complete with wooden acting, awful special-effects (which is pretty pitiful, given that action is about the only thing a movie like this is expected to deliver) a plot that might fly in a second-rate video game, and laughable dialouge.This movie is so bad, it makes Saturday morning cartoons look like Academy Award-winning material.  And that's about the only level in which you could even begin to derive any enjoyment out of this nonsense:  if you were an 8 year-old boy watching TV at 8am on a Saturday morning.",

I remember going to the theaters when this came out, when i was younger and craved the mindless action and violence of mortal kombat, and loving the first one, only to sit  in a dark room for an hour and a half, watching this debacal before me in a sold out crowd (half who were on the train of thought as me as thinking that this SUCKS!)  I was ashamed that i paid to see this.  This was the first movie i ever thought truly sucked.  Even in my younger age, when i would watch anything and like it, i walked out of that theater that day, with just a little less respect for mortal Kombat, and a very disappointed kid.

Christopher Lambert, while not being an excellent actor, was still VERY cool in the first Mortal Kombat. I had a bad feeling in the back of my brain when they replaced him with a...well...character that not only looked wimpy, but acted like a fly-swatter.The special defects...uh...special 'effects' in this movie were horrible! I'm not asking for fully rendered, super-resolution 3D \"Star Wars Ep 1\" environments...just enough technological know-how to make the movie look okay.The poor bastards couldn't even get close to those fairly forgiving expectations.The plot?  None.  Bad guy suddenly comes back, even though MK1 stated it was over and done with.  Characters go and show up like it was a frat party.

Not only did it lack many elements of Mortal Kombat 3 (The game it's based on), it lacked both punch and intricacy. The animations were poorly done (The animalities of Liu Kang and Shao Kahn during their fight) were both blurred horribly and were almost impossible to infer upon; second off, some of the very important characters were NOT presented. (This second comment also refers to the first movie.) Noob Saibot, Sektor and a volley of others weren't identified at all during the movie. On top of that, following up from the first movie, the creators of the movies should have sought the old actors and actresses. (Johnny Cage and Sonya-Blade.) The new actors for this movie did not fit the roles as well and I personally didn't like their appearances in them. The movie was entirely downhill after the initial fight scene. That's all folks.",

It seems as though this film's only purpose was to cram in as many Mortal Kombat characters as could fit in an hour and a half.  The film was also ruined by inconsistant casting: there were about eight (Scorpion, Sub-Zero, Blade, Cage, Rayden, Liu Kang, Kitana, and Jax) characters that appeared in both films.

But, seeing as how I enjoyed the first Mortal Kombat as a young adolescent male, I figured I'd give it a try, it would only cost me 3$ and barely 1 & \u00bd hours if every instinct I had proved to be right. Well, after trying to watch this film (I guess you can call it a film since it is barely feature length. but even that was too much for me since I turned it off after 20 minutes) for the first time on home video, I can truly say that it was one of the worst films I've ever seen. The sample (thank God I had the sense to turn it off when I did) was enough for me to rate it as `almost' one of my least favourite films, garnering a 2/10. Some might say 2/10 was gracious, however I've seen some truly wretched films (Not another teen movie, Batman & Robin, Caligula etc.) and I felt I couldn't give it worse since I only managed to stomach 20 minutes. I took the hit, kissed my three bucks goodbye, rated it and forgot about it as quickly as I could.\nUnluckily, as fate would have it, I recently decided to make a compilation of some of my least favourite movies and rate them anew, and although Mortal Kombat: Annihilation did not make the cut it was somehow in the back of my mind. Like the memory of the aftermath of a night of binge drinking, I couldn't shake the ghastly feeling of sickness any time I though of the first viewing of the film. So when the film happened to show up on TV (who knows what the station directors were thinking when they OK'd that programming), I thought to myself `I should watch it to see if it truly does deserve to be on my list' and that `it couldn't have been that bad'.  Plus I had to kill 2 hours before going out so I thought `why not?' For some reason I must have repressed more than I thought, or I just didn't get a good enough sample the first time, but in any case the full viewing of this utter waste of celluloid will haunt me for the rest of my days. I won't go into detail as to why the film is so putrid, I believe many here have already accurately recounted the many shortcomings, however I did want to mention that the film is now firmly enshrined in my top 10 worst list, having been revised down to a 1/10 (and now that's being gracious). If there's one recommendation I can make it's to not see the film, save yourself 91 minutes of pain (or if you're into S&M, pleasure), or if you absolutely have to see it (ie. you have a death wish) then bear in mind that you're in for a movie that should really have been directed by Alan Smithee, and then even he would have wanted to change his name before it was released.",

However, this film had the worst acting I've ever seen in my life and the storyline or plot could have been a lot better, it was too weak. I'm glad this movie had more fighting because that's what MK is all about, but the story didn't match up to it and the acting was even worse.They should have expanded the story into two films, with this one finishing as a cliffhanger because the story was to big to squeeze into one film. Only for the fighting/music and because I'm an MK fan I would give it a 7/10 but I'll the acting was more like 2/10, so I should give it a 4, but without taking the poor acting into consideration and seeing how much I loved seeing the different characters and the fighting based on that alone I'll would give it a 7. So, overall 6 stars.The conclusion is, if you are a MK fan, give it a go, if you like action film with a lot of fighting then watch it, other than that I suggest you stay away because it will just be a waste of time.",

            "content": "I firmly believe that going to a movie in the theater should be a pleasant experience 95% of the time. However, I have come to realize (as most others have) that when you go to see a movie in the theater, there is one indisputable fact: ANY movie shown in the smallest theater space within 1 week of its opening should be run from... even before the previews for other horrid films start rolling!!! Needless to say, I decided to give this film a chance. All the other reviews mention the main problems: an overabundance of special effects combined with a plot similar to the anecdotes a 3rd grader writes on a bathroom stall. This film wanted to be what the first film was: unique, fun, even entertaining. IT ISN'T. However, let's remember a few things. (1)video games RARELY translate well into movies (cases in point - Double Dragon and Super Mario Bros.). (2) Sequels should have more than 2 actors returning from the first film (you know that even Christopher Lambert was glad he dodged this bomb). And finally, (3) Films should have a plot people can follow. This film tried to cover material in 2 video games and it simply ended up being a colossal mess. Personally, I would be less interested in the 'fate o' the world' stuff and more interested in asking questions like: \"Hey, how'd he age backwards? Who invited the Minotaur to this party?\" and the like. By now, no one else will ever have to see this in the theater as I did. Be thankful.",

            "content": "Is Mortal Kombat Annihilation a worthy sequel to Mortal Kombat? Yes and no. This film is universally hated, and I can understand why. I am a huge movie fan, and a huge Mortal Kombat fan, so I do have mixed feelings about this film. What the film doesn't give is an accurate portrayal of Shao Kahn, Shinnok, or Raiden. I'm not badmouthing the actors, Brian Thompson, Reiner Schone(I think thats how you spell it) and James Remar are all good in the parts for what it is, I blame the script and the not so good (however his first) attempt at directing by John Leonetti. Sandra Hess as Sonya Blade was a definite upgrade from Bridgette Wilson, Robin Shou was still...well there, Talisa Soto was so-so, Lynn Williams was good as Jax, and the rest of the cast was fairly good, especially Musetta Vander as Sindel. The early (though expected) death of Johnny Cage (one of the most popular MK characters) was not nearly sensational enough, he should lasted a bit longer for dramatic purposes. Sheeva, Baraka, Rain, Cyrax, Smoke, and Mileena were all killed fairly easy (at least Baraka, Cyrax, Smoke, and Mileena got to fight). Nightwolf and the whole animality bit was just not needed. The movie did however boast good fight scenes, the \"special moves\" were a little overused, but overall very good. The FX weren't very good, but it didn't bother me much. Some of the story was told very well, while other parts were well just ignorant. Raiden getting a new look was a joke, and him and Kahn being brothers...LAME! The first thirty to forty-five minutes of this film is actually pretty decent, but after that its pretty crappy. Overall a nice try, and deserving of being recognized as a piece of MK, but not to be taken seriously (kind of like Kenshi) if your not an MK fan its about a 4.5 out of 10, but if you are its about a 6.5 out of 10.",

            "content": "In the opinion of many, the original Mortal Kombat held the distinction of being the first movie-to-vide game conversion that didn't suck.However, where the first one succeeded, MKA one failed miserably.With the first movie, though being a fan of the video game series helped you identify more with the characters, it wasn't absolutely critical to be able to enjoy the movie, especially if you were a martial arts fan. This is probably the biggest flaw of the second movie. A character appears seemingly out of nowhere for a fight scene and although MK fans know who they are, the general audience has no clue. Most of the characters that appear like this are either killed off in the single fight scene or disappear and are never heard from again. In a couple of instances, the names of the characters weren't even mentioned. It was a bad attempt to try and squeeze every single character from the video game into the movie. (And it's still missing some character - Kintaro and Kung Lao come to mind.)Another huge problem with the movie is that a sequel should not require that you have watched the original in order to enjoy it and understand everything that's going on. This movie picks up the second that the original one left off and spends only about 30 seconds explaining what happened the the first movie, but someone who hasn't seen the original has no way of identifying with the characters at all, who are never really introduced because the very first scene starts with Shao kahn invading the earth.Probably the next biggest fault of the movie is that it's missing Christopher Lambert as Rayden. Though the new guy that played Rayden tried hard, it just wasn't a good casting decision. And the other actors were pretty bad as well. The original MK certainly didn't win any awards for its acting, but the acting in this one is just plain bad for the most part.Another problem with the movie is continuity and other such issues. A good deal of the movie revolves around Liu Kang searching through the desert trying to find a character named Nightwolf in order to 'find his animality', which is supposed to prepare him for a final battle with Shao Kahn. However, all of this was totally unnecessary, since learning his animality had no impact whatsoever on the outcome of the final fight scene. Also, we have Shao Kahn's father who is trying to destroy the earth .. we are told nothing about him, except that he is an elder god. Heck, we don't even learn his name. He says that breaking the 'sacred rules' of the elder gods to invade the earth could have dire consequences if they ever found out, but we learn later in the movie that they already know about it in the first place. WTF?People say there's no plot in this movie, but I disagree. It's about an evil emperor of a place called 'Outworld' who tries to merge his world with ours, therefore destroying the earth in 6 days. A group of humans have to keep this from happeneing. Even though this movie is bad, I think saying it has no plot is a little unfair. (If you really want to see a movie that has no plot, watch Forrest Gump.) As for the special effects, I've never been one to judge, but they seem ok to me *shrug*In the end, though I did enjoy parts of this movie, I thought it paled in comparison to the original. If you didn't like the original, you definitely won't like this one. If you loved the original, well .... you still probably won't like this one.",

Now for my favourite subject, the cast.Robin Shou and Talisa Soto reprise their roles as Liu Kang and Princess Kitana, but without Christopher Lambert as Rayden the movie severely lacks a spark. James Remar was pathetic in every way, I was not impresed at all. Irina Pantaeva and Musetta Vander were all right in thier roles and Sandra Hess made a decent Sonya. Lynn \"Red\" Williams absolutely stank, and personally I wouldn't cast him for anything.The fight scenes were un-realistic and appealed only to children who went home and acted them out after they had seen it. Sheeva's was particularly pathetic.

The total disruption of the mythology of the MK universe was almost unbearable even for someone not interested in the MK universe. Elder gods with personal agendas, gods turned mortal to satisfy some undisclosed purpose, cheating against the divine rules with only minimal consequences... Weak.Still, the movie had a few moments that weren't completely bleak - moments that might have been greatly strengthened if the editing hadn't been designed to destroy them.My recommendation - let the kids watch it if it comes on TV.

(Yes, I know it's sad.) This movie is just god awful. The fighting scenes are so fake. I just love it when they do their little flips instead of walking three feet. There is a feeble plot that has many holes and mistakes. The first scene is one of ninjas falling out of the sky in fireballs. And it doesn't get much better then that. If you love to make fun of movies, this is the best movie you'll ever find. If not, don't watch it. The worst (or best) scenes are when 1. Kitana's mother screams and walks up the steps whith rock music playing, 2. When Kitana is kidnapped and Lou says \"I've got to find Kitana\" and 3. when Jade appears in the middle of the Hopi mason wearing a loin clothe. Of course, the rest of the movie is riddled it equally bad scenes. As said before, I would definitely recommend this movie to all people who love to mock movies. I would also recommend, if you get it on DVD, to read what all the actors have to say about their character. It's sad how serious they take it. Plus, you can read about \"seemingly limitless, bio-organic, living, creature spears\". (It might be better to watch while drunk. I don't know, I haven't tried it yet)",

Gone have the moderately good actors, and actress, and gone has the coherent plot which was faithful to the original arcade game. What is brought to the big screen is a complete mess which you get the impression is what was left on the cutting room floor. Scenes do not fit together properly, you are left wondering where on earth the characters are coming and going from, while the fight scenes seem to be based around someone getting hit and then flying back 15 feet through the air and then repeated until they choose not to get up again. Now, I am big fan of Mortal Kombat and felt this sequel put to shame the good work done by the original. Even if Christopher Lambert had returned for this one it probably still could not rise above mediocre.In short: do not waste your time with this catastrophe.",

            "content": "Yep this horrible piece of garbage was not only the worst sequel and video game based movie; it was probably the worst movie ever made. I can give out hundreds of reasons why this was a terrible movie. But to save space I'm not gonna give all of them.After the success of the original Mortal Kombat film the sequel was highly anticipated among fans. When most saw it, the film was a total disaster and a box office flop. Viewers not familiar with the games knew it was terrible b/c the recasting was horrifying, the direction was bad, the dialogue was wooden, the acting was lame, the script was poorly written, the special effects were cartoonish and the fights looked more like carefully choreographed dance routines. I think the actors were in this for just one reason, the $$$$$. I think this movie flopped because the characters were played by unknowns. I didn't know who any of them were before I saw it. Well Except for Robin Shou and Talisa Soto because they were the only actors from the original that came back for this one. Not only did they come back Shou looked like he had forgotten how to act and Soto looked like she had forgotten how to fight.Overall the movie looked like an 85 minute Power Ranger ripoff! Most of the outfits looked like cheap costumes bought out of some Halloween shop. Most of the characters were just thrown in there for (3 minutes) no reason. It looked like their only goal was to fit in as many characters as possible without developing them. Even though they did that it felt like there weren't enough characters in the film. The fights were way too short; they were less than 2 minutes long. What was the point of going underground in those metal balls??? They looked like an American Gladiator ripoff! Sheeva and Motaro looked more like humans in costumes rather than vicious-threatening creatures. Shao Kahn looked more like a human bully without his mask. The annoying techno/dance music made it look more like a trashy music video.The recasting on the same characters was a disaster. You got these new actors that were so not talented like the original actors. The new Rayden (James Remar) and the new Sonya (Sandra Hess) failed to bring out the appearance and portrayal Christopher Lambert and Bridgette Wilson brought into them. Sandra Hess made Sonya look more like a sluty model rather than a military woman. Lynn `Red' Williams sucked as Jax; he was a military general who talked like a street thug from the hood. Give me a break, black men in the military/army do not talk like gangsters from the hood. Rayden looked more like Sting when he gave himself that cheesy make-over.\nI can go on and on about why this horrible adventure film looked more like some poor excuse to make money. For now I think you all get the point of my review.0/5 I give a big fat 0 because I saw no effort put into this. I saw laziness and selfishness put into it.",

My Junior Class movie was better than this, and made a hell of a lot more sense. That being said, I love watching it.If you're not a fan of really crappy movies, or Mortal Kombat for that matter, then you will likely turn this off in disgust after about three minutes (like I did with \"Honey\"). I, however, enjoy watching really bad movies, and am an MK fan. I also saw this movie when I was nine, and proceeded to think it was the greatest movie of all time. Nostalgia can be pretty fun sometimes.The story is, well, non-existent. Shao Kahn has violated the rules of the tournament and has invaded Earth using the resurrection of the previously-deceased Queen Sindel, Kitana's mother. This, of course, is briefly mentioned once or twice in the movie and no explanation is given. I only knew it because it's the premise of MK3. Anyway, our heroes Liu Kang, Kitana, Raiden, Sonya and Jax proceed on a seven-day long quest to save Earth, which is miraculously completed in about 90 minutes. Fight scenes are alright...just gotta remember it's pyre-Matrix and Hollywood. They'd be better if the direction wasn't so bad. Sometimes they can go at a nice, fast pace and then slow down for no reason, just to draw out the impact. The result is cheesy.If it's on Spike TV some night (and it is, a lot), don't be afraid to tune in for a few minutes. Even if you're completely new to the material, you may laugh yourself silly.

Who could blame me? The first movie, up until the recent final fantasy 7 movie (which i'd suggest watching) was probably the very best video game movie made, and wasn't a bad piece of cinema. However, now mortal kombat Annihilation comes into play, and there could never be a more appropriate title for it. It really did annihilate the mortal kombat franchise. To be fair, I would normally tell you about some good moments of the movie to even things out and give it justice, but sadly there were none. All the good characters from the first have been replaced or killed, and the result is devastating. Costumes and lines are just plain cheesy (to bad you...will die!) and there are a lot of plot holes (\"The earth was built in six days, so in two shall it be destroyed, and on the seventh day, mankind will bow down!\". What? If you destroy it on the 6th day, how can we bow down on the 7th). The entire movie is just a gigantic waste of time. I would rather watch my grandmother have a seizure while getting eaten by a pack of rabid wolves then look at the case of that movie again. the only relieving point of this movie, is that the music score is OK ( literally the only point of the movie that can possibly be called \"OK\"). It's hard to believe there is a movie on the face of this planet that I would rather see in the hands of Uwe Boll then the people who made it, as it would have been an improvement. I'd go on, but even talking about this movie makes me wish i had lung cancer. It's difficult to claim which movie on the planet is the worst, but this is the worst. Avoid. This movie is just one large mess. Fatality!",

The funniest part of the film, after watching the previous one, is the really unsubtle addition of new actors, as well as the way far too many characters get crammed into the film, with quite a few whose presence doesn't add to the plot and only have a slight role in the film. Overall this is just a big stinker. Its full of all the negative clich\u00e9s a film can have. Some of the fight scenes are fun to watch. If you are expecting a deep or rich storyline, which is passionately directed and acted then avoid this like the plague!It seems watching this film is a fatality itself.

This movie has got to be the biggest load of nonsense i've ever seen! The fact that it was shown in cinemas would have seriously degraded the Mortal Kombat franchise. The first movie actually made Paul Anderson look like a good director compared to this rubbish. It looked like a straight to video-type of a film. Lets see why I'm giving this film a 1/10, a 0/10 would have been more like it but IMDb doesn't allow for a 0. 1) It had HORRIBLE acting, everyone looked so stiff and the fight scenes where so badly choreographed. 2) The Special FX has got to be the funniest thing anyone must've seen in any film made from 1990 onwards. (SPOILER) The part where Liu Kang and Shao Kahn turn into dragons was so fake, it seemed like the producers thought of it just in the last minute to extract the most out of the Mortal Kombat series. In general, the CGI looked exactly like the ones in Mortal Kombat Conquest.....a TV series. 3) The backdrops (inner rooms of most scenes) just looked like a studio. The directing and camera work didn't help it hide the fact that it was a studio. Overall, this is such a bad film, I'm glad i wasn't one of those who watched it in the cinema and ended up leaving embarrassed for wasting some hours on a film like this.

Like everything is made out of that cheap ass poly foam cheap budget movie crap...Like a couple of bozos where \"Martial Arting\" and they jump on some bridge in some fake ass cave straight out of Disney land, probably right in the lame ass pirates of the Caribbean ride/set.. I mean, whats the deal with \"put a blue light and a orange light perfectly on one side of each actors face\" deal....? Remember the first Mortal COMBAT..(Yes I didn't use a K). I dunno, its like the lighting and directing of this movie came straight from some high school film class, and a bunch of smelly kids are like \"hey lets make that cool video game into a movie\", then everyone screams \"YEAH!\" and they all start high fiving each other...Anyway, Aliens VS Predator I thought was the worst movie in the world...then I saw Lazor Mission, but they don't really compare because Lazor Mission obviously had a budget of five bucks..Aliens VS predator OMG I don't even want to think about how many African kids could eat like Bill gates for 10 years regarding how much AVP costs for that crap.....Anyway if I had to estimate Im sure Mortal COMBAT had a budget of about..ohhh I dunno a couple hundred bucks. This movie is SO horrible...you want a review...OK.. people jump around a lot..and everything look ridiculous and fake and what else...the lighting is probably the worst ever devised in any movie..so thats probably not easy to pull off..good work. See this movie if you like to roll on the ground laughing almost to death!",

Sure the graphics are a bit crappy but i think that over all the movie was good! And the portrayal of James Remar playing Rayden like a wuss is completely unacceptable, the fact that he seems more...soft shall we say. Makes it a lot more humanizing of the thunder god. I really enjoyed MKA a lot more compared to the first. Also the fact that Rayden is faced with a difficult decision shows just how serious the situation is. Well there's my 5cents worth!! Enjoy. So my summary is this: If you like it you like it, if you don't..well then you don't, but don't go putting actors down for their performances...Remember that they are human to.

I like it, because there's a lot of action, and the fight between Cyrax and Jax is pretty cool.  Jax is the best part of this movie.  Lynn Red Williams also happens to be the best actor in this movie.  That is also not a good thing. Well, at least it's not as bad as Street Fighter.  Man, talk about a crappy movie.",

            "content": "Let me start by saying that since the original Mortal Kombat on sega genesis I have been quite a big fan. I haven't played the games religiously, but they are the best fighting games out there. When the first movie came out, I was too young to care, but when I finally saw it I was pleased overall. I thought that more characters and a longer runtime wouldn't have hurt, but I figured that a sequel would make up for that. Hell, the Mortal Kombat games just keep getting better, why wouldn't the movie do the same? Boy was I wrong...The plot is stupid to begin with. If Shao Khan could have entered earth and broke the rules himself with an elder god on his side, why did he bother with the Tournament for ten generations? Wouldn't he just have invaded. That's when earth would have been at it's weakest. Why did Johnny Cage die?That was another dumb move. He never died in the game. Also, sequels annoy me when they take old characters and make them dumb or use different actors. Raiden was wicked cool in the original. He was Christopher Lambert, the original HIGHLANDER!!! Where the hell did they get this guy. I think I saw him in an army movie once. He should stick to that, because he plays a terrible immortal. Especially one as cool as Raiden. Also, the characters that were put into this movie weren't used to their full potential. I'm a bit curious as to why they were chosen. They should have brought back the true stars of the series, Sub Zero and Scorpion. And the mother/daughter subplot was mindless, absolutely mindless. Also, the spirit of the game seems to be absent. In the first one, you really felt like the Island was another world. It had a sort of realism to it that the game captured. This movie was trying to be much darker, but they just came off as wicked cheesy. The dialouge sucks also. What the hell was up with the animality bs? I don't understand why you would have to fight as a dragon when you've already got all those powers. I think I know what Ed Boon was trying to do. He was trying to add more characters and recognizable traits or special moves from the game for the fans. Unfortunately, he forgot to write a story. If they make another sequel, please god, have them do it right!!!Rating: *",

And come one some characters were killed without showing them like Striker and Kabal. Lets not talk about Sindel that actress was horrible. Give me a break, that animality part was totally stupid. The character Jade first of all she is not Japanese she is supposed to be Hispanic or Black like the game. Milenna was a disaster. Baraka and Sheeva were killed instantly. Stupid. The only cool one was Cyrax. So, Definitely stick with the 1st one and the games. Mortal Kombat Annihalation should be Annihalated.",

The action sequences and the special effects were OK for it's time, Christopher Lambert starred (that's right, I DO like Lambert!), and it had a killer soundtrack. Annihilation on the other hand is set place in the worst digitally made world possible, ALL the time! Lambert is replaced by some stupid looking guy who thinks he's cool but looks like my grandfather. The plot is, besides non-existing, stupid stupid and stupid, and the fighting scenes were already made in the first movie (except when the only two female characters of any significance fight in a pool of mud). On top of all this, the actors could easily be replaced by monkeys, no one would know.You can sum Mortal Kombat Annihilation up with only two letters: N O !",

This MIGHT be excusable if the fight scenes were in some way entertaining or exciting. Sadly, that isn't the case.  Every fight scene is exactly the same and always seems to involve our hero being launched backwards about 10 meters from a single hit.It takes some of the worst acting in the world to take a script THIS bad and make a movie that's even worse, but Mortal Kombat: Annihilation does it with ease.Believe me when I say ANYTHING is better than watching this garbage!

            "content": "Warning: Spoilers\nI still remember seeing this movie. At the time, I was enamored with all things Mortal Kombat and I greatly enjoyed the first film even though I knew it wouldn't sweep the Oscars. So when the movie theater I worked at put this poster up I just KNEW I had to see it. And I did.\n\nThus it is with great trepidation that I write this reluctant review. I really wanted so much to like this movie but... I just can't.\n\nWhere to begin? Well, obviously for those who saw the first movie, some key players got Darrined. Sonya, Johnny Cage, and Rayden are all played by different actors. The only problem I had with the new actors was the usual disappointment of getting attached to the originals. Believe it or not, I actually preferred the new Sonya as she seemed more badass and true to the original game character design. Johnny isn't around long enough for you to hate him and James Remar is OK, but he's no Lambert. If only Sandra Hess had been in the first one instead of the lame Bridgette Wilson.\n\nThe plot is just all over the map in this one. Rules are established then broken without explanation. Plot twists are introduced then forgotten. There's mystic nonsense about elder gods, Kitana having to reunite with her mother to save the world, Shao Khan being able to do whatever he wants because of Kitana's mother, finding your inner animality and Rayden giving up his immortality. Liu Kang is given three tests by a magical Native American but the movie forgets the other two and apparently courageousness means being able to resist a hot woman in a bikini. Sonya rescues Jax who has been given bionic metal arms because... your guess is good as mine. SubZero shows up to offer assistance to the heroes at a later time but later never comes. Kitana gets to play damsel in distress. Motaro and Sheeva hate each other but we have no idea why. Rain gets killed because he didn't make his victims suffer enough. Nobody seems to wonder where the rest of the people on earth disappeared to. Jade turns traitor because the script says so, I guess. Most people also cite that Johnny Cage is unceremoniously killed off at the beginning but his death was actually a plot point in MK3 (the game was on MK4 when the movie came out) so I can understand why they did it. The rest of it, who knows?\n\nThe dialogue and acting are just bad. It's fitting that Shao Kahn and Sindel are king and queen because in terms of acting, they are made of ham. Musetta Vander gets such awful dialogue that one wonders if she wasn't overacting on purpose and Brian Thompson is impossible to take seriously because of his scene-chewing delivery and less than imposing stature. Both Rayden and Sonya feel the need to comment on new hairstyles and the importance of personal hygiene in the middle of an apocalypse. Jax is another stereotypical black dude with attitude and Irina Pataneva (Jade) once again proves that walking down a runway does not automatically translate into acting ability.\n\nI would comment on the other characters' acting ability but therein lies another problem: most of the characters aren't on screen long enough to actually act. Characters are thrown into the middle of the action, most without proper introduction only to be killed or forgotten seconds later, some of them without even fighting. Outsiders to the Mortal Kombat game franchise will have no idea who most of these people are and fans of the games will only see their favorite characters long enough to say \"Yep, that's Baraka,\" \"Yep, that's Mileena.\" The movie ends up being a cavalcade of cameos due to the disproportionally short running time and does the already flimsy plot no favors.\n\nEvery bad movie, of course, has one area that it excels at in terms of badness, and while the above examples are certainly worthy contenders, the special effects truly get the ultimate razzie here. I'm not one to pick on special effects too much but even I could tell these were bad. Highlights include the laughably bad CGI wall monster, the green screen lab explosion, the shapeshifter showdown between Liu Kang and Shao Kahn that looks straight out of the mind of Ray Harryhausen, and Motaro. Just... Motaro. They say that an actual Sheeva fight was originally planned but scrapped due to budget constraints. Judging by the effects they actually DID keep, that was probably a wise decision.\n\nIt pains me to have to trash this movie. I wanted so much to like it. I really did. But even as I watched it in the movie theater a week after opening, the whole thing just felt off. It almost played out like a parody or cheap knockoff of the first film. I also couldn't help but noticing that after the first weekend, the audience had all but vanished.\n\nPerhaps I should've taken the hint.",

Also, hey, how come Sonya, Johnny Cage and Raiden's actors get to escape from this crap and get different actors but Liu Kang and Kitana's stay? The biggest narm however is the bad greenscreen effects and CGI. The first movie had these shortcomings too but at least, only one character got the PS1 treatment and we got a really good animatronic out of it. Here, we have CGI that came out of a bad PS1 game. Seriously, what was wrong with New Line back in 1997? I say that because this movie came out the same year as Spawn, which also had glaringly bad CGI, even for the late '90s. MK: Annihilation is a bad movie that has no redeeming qualities beyond being snark bait due to its poor production values.",

Yes, you can see where they imposed CGI and where a character is moving against a blue screen. The \"special effects\" are F-grade, the kind you find in a hapless hacker's basement.\n\nThe second thing you'll notice right away are the character designs. Never mind the latex on Sheeva, what made me laugh was Motaro's design. Wow, I didn't think that Tenacious D's devil from The Pick of Destiny would be more threatening than that. The dialogue is corny and idiotically spoken right out of the gates, and I know it's going to get worse. \n\nSo obviously, one of the things they try to do is make this more serious by having Johnny Cage become a classic red-shirt and get his neck snapped only 6 minutes into the film. That might be beneficial to preserving his character by having Cage cut from the cast list right away. I wouldn't be surprised if he refused to show up for the premiere of the film at the local AMC or even see it in theaters.\n\nI should mention that Shao Kahn in this film looks like someone I would hang out with at the gym. The game's Shao Kahn is a mix of Tarkatan face and human; this one is not. That's not the image you want to give me. I thought that scene was a decent TV level conversation, but it could have been a bit better.\n\nAnd of course, the final fight with the infamous CGI. It doesn't last long, but the CGI returns at the end of the fight.\n\nSo what can I say about this that hasn't already been said before? I know this film has already been dealt with by so many people, but I wanted to do my own look at it. Here's how I sum it up.\n\nThe dialogue is not particularly memorable, there are a lot of weird yells and grunts that did not endear me to the Kombatants not named Jax, and the CGI is awful. The only Mortal Kombat game I've ever played is the Sega Genesis version of the original, and I can say with full confidence that that game looks a hell of a lot better than this movie.\n\nMKA is just a dumb-ass attempt to be a fantasy martial arts film, and surprisingly a step down from the original film. Next time, talk to Jackie Chan, Michael Dimartino or Bryan Konieztko regarding that idea, not the dummies who made this.",

            "content": "~~~~~~(MAJOR SPOILERZ!!!!)~~~~~~\n\nLet us just start with saying that all the reviews of this movie were wrong, and that we honest to God believe that this is an  amazing movie. Let us tell you why! \n1) Every character was lovable. \nJax: As the token black guy, he filled his role just like his witty and urban banter filled my heart. At first when we saw that Johnny Cage died and was replaced by Jax we were sorely upset, but after he opened his mouth and spit his first hilarious line we were hooked for sure! Also let us just say that he is HUGE! Ladies will love this movie! \nLiu Kang: Immediately we were struck by his hair. We had seen it before in the first movie (also a must watch), and we are proud to say that not a single hair has been displaced. It looked just as luxurious, if not more so. Liu Kang struggles throughout the movie with low self-esteem, and the three dimensional nature of his character really strengthens the movie as a whole. \nSonya: Wow, nipples. Shes back and even hotter than before, and now with a new love interest in Jax. This classy Hollywood hottie is now paired up with a black dude, and is fighting social norms while kickin' ass. Cool. \nShiva: Double the arms, double the fun. We both have had a crush on her since the we moment  saw her, and we agree she is without a doubt the most beautiful woman either of us have ever seen. We wish we had a girl like Shiva to do some \"Mortal Kombat\" with, if you know what we mean.\nWe could honestly go on, this movie was filled with amazing, sorry, let us reiterate, AMAZING characters which we could write about until \"Annihilation\". We wish that they were a part of our great big family.\n2) The Kombat was amazing.\nFirst off, the flips. They rule! The characters basically flip everywhere. You might think it would get old, or just look stupid but we are glad to report that it doesn't. The choreographers and the stunt doubles really did a bang-up job. Just when you thought the flips would stop, or that it wasn't appropriate in the scene, they pulled a fast one on you and stuck one in there. It fit every time and felt great. We honestly believe they could squeeze a flip into a sex scene if they weren't stuck to a PG13 rating. Besides the flips, the fight choreography was a visual banquet and fight choreographers Robin Shou and Pat E. Johnson deserve more recognition for their masterful accomplishment. The kicks, punches, leg sweeps, and cartwheels are top knotch. Sonya has a magnificent high kick, smacking perpetrators for miles around with her beautifully meaty legs. The special wizard powers of characters like sub-zero and nightwolf (that vision quest was groovy) added a whole new dimension that conventional martial arts movies just can't match.\n3) Special effects\nThe special digital effects (both 3-D and 2-D) were mind-expanding at the time of the movies release, and believe it or not they still hold up powerfully today. We're at a loss for words trying to describe the climactic dragon fight between Liu Kang and Shao Khan. It's truly something that has to be seen to be understood. The digital effects team hits hard, fast, and often with a rambunctious energy in their craft and love in their hearts, leaving us and my companions stunned and speechless for indefinite hours.\n4) The plot\nWe cried when Johnny Cage died. The bond between Johnny and Sonya was so deep that during that scene we almost felt like we lost our own lover. We were brought to tears. Other scenes had the perfect mix of poignancy and sexy. Many times we were left both misty-eyed and half-chubbed, a perfect mixture.\n5)Conclusion\nIn short, this movie has changed our lives for the better. We live our lives like Sonya, and make sure we make connections with our loved ones because we know they could be ripped away at a moments notice. The wise words of Raiden echo in our brains, helping us overcome any challenge or trial that life can toss our way. We used to get caught up, but now we can front flip through the fires of hell without the slightest of harm befalling us.  \n\nWe thoroughly believe everybody should see this at least twice in their lifetime; it's just that good.\n\nOver and out, Carney and Matt",

I was ashamed that i paid to see this. This was the first movie i ever thought truly sucked. Even in my younger age, when i would watch anything and like it, i walked out of that theater that day, with just a little less respect for mortal Kombat, and a very disappointed kid.

The dialogue is even cornier this time around, the story is unengaging and annoyingly self-important, the clothing design quality is at Walgreens Halloween-costume level, the characters are lame and not to mention those horrendous special effects straight out of a SyFy network movie. With that said, plus its soundtrack consisting of bland, jarring techno music, Mortal Kombat: Annihilation is a spit in the face to both fans of the games and cinema in general.",

            "content": "After watching the first Mortal Kombat movie, there is a sequel that no one asked for. But we got it anyway. And it is no directed by Paul W.S. Anderson. \n\nLui Kang (Robin Shou) and the crew (except Johnny Cage because he died in the first few minutes) has get to victory before Shao-Kahn (Brian Thompson), the evil Emperor of the Outerworld, who has a new plan to overtake planet Earth. He has also discovered a portal between Earth and Outerworld. If it stays open for seven days (which I do not understand why), the two worlds will merge, and Shao-Kahn taking control both planets. Rayden (not played by Christopher Lambert) and Sonya (Sandra Hess) set to find his colleague Jax (Lynn Red Williams) while Liu Kang and Kitana (Talisa Soto) are on the trail of Nightwolf/ Litefoot as they race against time to defeat Shao-Kahn, who has brought Queen Sindel (Musetta Vander), who is Katana's mother, back from the dead to aid his evil scheme.\n\nThe sequel to Mortal Kombat, Mortal Kombat: Annihilation is an unnecessary sequel in every way. If you did not see the first film, you will not know what is going on because I did not. You will wonder who these people are, where they are going, what is their motivation, and most of all what the hell is going on. There are twists and turns during the movie (for example Rayden mentions that Shao-Kahn is his brother) but I either did not care, I really saw it coming, or both.\n\nThe acting for the most part is pretty bad. I think it is because they got a new cast. While the cast for the first movie was not perfect, but atleast have better acting than the new cast in Moral Kombat: Annihilation. I will say: the new cast try to give good to decent performances but they unfortunately they have to do what the script and the direction tell them to do (which are both equally bad). \n\nThe special effects in this movie are really horrendous. They look a Saturday morning cartoon special. In fact, they are the some of the worst special effects I have ever watched. If the special effects are this bad, then this movie should went straight to video. \n\nLastly, the only people see a movie like Mortal Kombat: Annihilation is to see some fights. They are decent to downright bad. After watching the fight scenes, they get repetitive and old real fast. \n\nAt the end, Mortal Kombat: Annihilation is a joke. It is incredibly bad in every way. The fight scenes might be decent to bad but that does not save the movie from been a failure or the fact that they are repetivite, consists of characters dodging each other by kicking over and over again or doing somersaults over and over again. This is a guilty pleasure because you can watch how bad the acting is, how laughable the dialogue is, and how horrendous the effects are.\nIf can see it, especially if you not a fan of bad movies, then you might need to avoid this movie and see the first one, which is so much better than this.",

Yes, you heard it here. The man behind not one, not two, not three or four, but five shitty Resident Evil movies and Alien vs. Predator made the better film. To actually allow a feat like that to occur means taking shoddy filmmaking to such unthinkable depths of woe, and it should come as no surprise to anyone that a film whose best asset is stunt work that looks like a low-rent acrobatic act you'd expect to see set up shop on a Kmart parking lot reaches those depths like it's walk in the park.\n\nFull review at http://silverscreenfanatic.com/2015/02/02/what-the-hell-were-they-thinking-57/",

The special effects were simply abominable, and some of them look blatantly unfinished and lazily implemented. The overall production values are extremely low, which is completely bizarre when you consider that this movie had a bigger budget than its predecessor.

Anderson should've returned for a sequel called \"Mortal Kombat: Annihilation.\" He wasn't even involved or had to do with this abomination of a sequel. Thank goodness he still has a lot of sci-fi fans and of course, married to Resident Evil star Milla Jovovich. I think that \"Mortal Kombat: Annihilation\" always had a lot of bad reputation and they should because the movie only has Liu Kang (Robin Shou) but no returning characters from the original Kombat movie. Also, Annihilation just taken a page of the \"Mortal Kombat II\" playbook and it feels like a rerun of \"Kung Fu: The Legend Continues.\" And I don't know if the cast look good, but the story and the setting that they supposed to continue to where the original left off, it was just terrible. To me, I won't be watching this on Blu-Ray. This is one of the worst video game movies/sequels of all time. And I think that eventually hurt Midway's chances to continue with the Mortal Kombat franchise since Mortal Kombat 4 and all of its adventure games started to fade away. I hope Warner Bros. (which New Line still owns the rights, but the studio was merged in 2008 to Warner Bros./New Line Cinema) should reboot the movie franchise and hopefully soon, maybe Paul W.S. Anderson could get another shot by returning to his roots as a director from the first \"Mortal Kombat\" franchise and how bout making a setting requiring the events from last year's critically-acclaimed \"Mortal Kombat\" video game reboot.",

            "content": "As Mortal Kombat served as a guilty pleasure, I hoped that at worst its sequel would do the same.\n\nMortal Kombat: Annihilation is set up to be troubled on the mere surface because it is a sequel to an adaptation of a video game and it features replacement cast members for other dropouts. But with a budget of $30 million which equals nearly twice the budget of the first Mortal Kombat, it should at least be a decent visual experience, right?\nWrong. Somehow, director John R. Leonetti managed to take a film that cost about twice as much as Mortal Kombat and make it look three times as cheap. The production design of the film is cardboard, the scenery is weak and the visual effects make the blue screen of the film so damn clear while the animated effects are nowhere near as organic as they were in Mortal Kombat. The quality of the visual effects in Mortal Kombat: Annihilation is very low which is surprisingly ridiculous, even for a film with a meagre budget of $30 million. That wasn't enough money to afford good visual effects, a talented cast or even anyone with a sense of how to craft a decent fight scene.\nThe first fight scene in Mortal Kombat: Annihilation depicts Shao Kahn and Raiden getting into a fight. All they essentially do the entire time is fly at each other, knock each other across the screen through slow motion and blue screen before it all reaches the end, and at about the same time viewers will realise the low quality of the film. The fight scenes in the film are choreographed terribly and filmed as such, as well as being edited to incur an excess of slow motion which was annoying in the film but insulting in Mortal Kombat: Annihilation. It is strange that the cinematography in Mortal Kombat: Annihilation is so poor because director John. R. Leonetti has contributed good cinematography to many films in his career. This time, his brother Matthew F. Leonetti has to take it on but is cursed with the distinct inability to capture good action scenes whatsoever. Admittedly the film was doomed from the start due to poor choreography, but the cinematography just captures ridiculously arbitrary elements some times. Still, it is far superior to the schlocky editing of the film which curses it all with excessive slow motion and awful speed. The one semi-decent fight scene is shared by Sub-Zero and Scorpion, but it is still not that good.\nWhile director Paul W.S. Anderson worked to make Mortal Kombat a guilty pleasure which is focused more on fighting than on storytelling, John R. Leonetti takes a different angle on it. It is a completely wrong one because it is more focused on storytelling than action, and the story is even more shoddy and senseless than the first time around. But worse than that, it means that the film takes itself seriously and therefore cannot be even a guilty pleasure. The atmosphere of the film was melodramatic, and not intense or dark in the otherworldly fashion of its predecessor, and it is constantly made cheaper by the lacklustre script and cheap technical elements of the film which leave Mortal Kombat: Annihilation as nothing but an exercise in terrible filmmaking and severe stupidity.\nMortal Kombat: Annihilation follows in its predecessor's footsteps by failing to deal justice to Johnny Cage. This time, it is because he is killed within 6 minutes of running time and then that is all. There is no telling what performance Chris Conrad may have given in the part or if the comic oriented nature of the character might have helped to change the overly serious atmosphere of the film. But as there is little time before he is gone, there is no telling how the film may have turned out if he remained present. Although, if it is anything like the rest of the cast, Chris Conrad would not have been likely to succeed.\nWhile I'm happy that Mortal Kombat: Annihilation brought the character Jax into play, Lynn \"Red\" Williams is pushed into a heavily stereotypically African-American archetype in the role. He is the intended source of comic effect in lieu of the dead Johnny Cage, but it is so painfully generic that it is not the slightest bit funny. Lynn \"Red\" Williams looks appropriate for the par, but he is given such lacklustre scripting and stereotypical character elements that he does nothing for the part and simply wallows in the shadow of the low standard of comic relief set by the first Mortal Kombat film.\nSandra Hess is a weak substitute for Bridgette Wilson. While Bridgette Wilson was far from perfect, she at least stood her ground as a serious and determined woman who was willing to put up a fight. With Sandra Hess, the difference is that she is put back into a singlet to reveal the busty state of the actress which later becomes all the more revealing as she goes through a mud wrestling scene and attempt to distract from the fact that she can do nothing for the part. Sandra Hess looks too different from Bridgette Wilson, cannot fight nearly as good and is there clearly for shallow sex appeal purposes. I don't deny that she is attractive, I deny that she is a good replacement or much of a good cast member. So Mortal Kombat: Annihilation fails to deal justice for Sonya Blade also because Sandra Hess is so clearly unintelligent and helpless in the role.\nTalisa Solo also takes a step down in the quality of her performance as Kitana. In the first film she did not get enough screen time or fight scenes, but in Mortal Kombat: Annihilation she gets even less. The one difference is that somebody decided to throw in a half-assed plot element which makes her mother one of the central antagonists, and so Talisa Solo has to focus more on drama than action. She is terrible. She wasn't great in the first film, but the unexpectedly low quality of her performance in Mortal Kombat: Annihilation was not something I was prepared for. So it is no surprise that after Mortal Kombat: Annihilation she was essentially never seen again, with the only exception being Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever which is recognised as being one of the worst films ever made.\nThe remaining characters are not as weak. But there are still no cast members who can transcend the half-decent standard which is set by James Remar.\nJames Remar is semi-decent as Raiden because he stands confidently in the part and delivers his lines with a minor of wisdom, but he is streets behind coming close to what Christophe Lambert put into the part. The tone of his voice and the myopia induced eyes of Christophe Lambert were what gave him the godlike sense which made him fit the profile, and James Remar has neither of those. But as far as he goes, he is ok and certainly stands out as the best cast member. But then again, considering the distinct lack of talent that he is up against there is not much he has to do in pursuit of that\nRobin Shou still has his spirit present in the role of Liu Kang, but the script and the direction of the story forces him through so much hokey tedium that there is little he can do. The poor choreography and shortage of his requirement in action scenes makes it all worse because it means that the best skills he brought to the first film as a fighter cannot be used in Mortal Kombat: Annihilation. Robin Shou brings nothing more than his mere presence to Mortal Kombat: Annihilation because he is only of paper thin relevance to the film.\nMusette Vander is a thoroughly awful antagonist, Brian Thompson performs like a WWE pro wrestler on meth as Shao Kahn and Deron McBee is just dreadful as Motaro.\n\nSo despite being the sequel to one of the better video game adaptations in cinematic history, Mortal Kombat: Annihilation runs incredibly far beneath the standard of Mortal Kombat: Annihilation due to a ridiculous plot, shoddy action scenes, cheap visuals and a cast who cannot save themselves from anything.",

In fact, all throughout this film, the fights seem to be taken up by a large number of jumping scenes. One of this films fight scenes is of two barely dressed women fighting in the mud (and it includes hair pulling), and the saddening thing is it isn't as hot as it sounds. \r\n\r\nIt really does not bode well for the movie when only two of the cast from the first film return. James Remar brings a less raspy voice to the role, and for some reason, changes his look (including a hair cut) before the final battle to look more hip or something. We get a new character to replace Johnny Cage, in Jax, complete with the metal arms and boasting the cheesy one liners we tolerated from Johnny Cage, whilst managing to be slightly annoying.\r\n\r\nThis film is chock full of plot holes and problems, but the biggest one has to be when Scorpion and Sub Zero appear for one scene to have one fight, and then, despite staying alive after the fight, never appear for the rest of the film. While it's explained how Sub Zero is here (he's the original S.Z's bro), we never get any explination why Scorpion is back from the dead or why he can talk now (his scream of \"SUCKERS!\" makes you cringe for a week). It would feel like fan-baiting to bring them back for the movie, but for one scene? It's illogical and pointless. Nightwolf also appears in a one-time useless appearance, granting Lui Kang three tasks, where we only see one and are told him lying down and trying to act was the first task.\r\n\r\nShao Khan is in no way a strong villian. He's by the numbers in everything, in his actions, in his plan, even his costume is the type of by the numbers thing you'd see for halloween. And it doesn't help that the actor acts and delivers his lines with an amount of cheese that is lethal for those with lactose intolerance. His henchmen are barely talking and one-note, what with a centaur gladiator, a lesbian tetramand and a chequered Scorpion/Sub-Zero/Reptile wanna-be, with none of them making any kind of an impression. Baraka makes an out of nowhere appearance, with bad make-up and an all-too easy defeat.\r\n\r\nThe crappy CGI is back in this film, only this time, in the form of a dragon fight and an awful looking demon for Jax to fight. When a fight scene in the film is centered around two terribly done CG dragons, you know this film isn't going to get much better. But the effects are bad also, so that hasn't changed.\r\n\r\nOne thing that struck me in the Outworld was the geographical inconsistencies. From one location, the characters could see the Eiffel Tower, the Twin Towers and Lui Kang's temple. I'm not geographer, but i'm pretty sure they're not meant to be so close together. But barely anything in this film manages to make sense, even the explination as to why the portal opened in the first place or how Queen Sindel is connected to the portal. Seeing as I mentioned Queen Sindel, here's a link to one of the worst/most hilarious film lines in history courtesy of her http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIt0VY7Yg2w\r\n\r\nWhen a film based around a series of fighting games cannot do good fight scenes, you know this film has fucked up. While the first Mortal Kombat film may not exactly be oscar winning standard, it's quite astounding how bad this film is. The plot doesn't make sense, the dialogue is awful, the acting is sub-par, and anything you liked about the first film has been diluted and re-used in this film.",

            "content": "This sequel to the first movie by Paul W.S. Anderson lacks the strength of the first movie it seriously lowers the bar of the Mortal Kombat trilogy and it is also the worse Mortal Kombat movie ever along with DOA Dead or Alive even the Uwe Boll video game adaptations. From what I can tell this is the worse movie ever I mean come on this sequel had nothing to do with the first movie at all. There are various reasons on why I hate this movie and why I also prefer the first one better.\n1) First of all there's no plot or story. The first movie was better because the first one has a really interesting plot this one is seriously boring and dumb.\n2) Second the directing is really bad and terrible. Director John R. Leonetti would have done something better in this movie and he didn't do a good job with his directing for one reason.\n3) Third the fight scenes are seriously pointless and boring. Unlike the first movie the first film has better fight scenes than this cheap movie because all of the fight scenes in Mortal Kombat Annihilation are seriously plain dumb and really boring.\n4) Fourth the effects in this movie are really bad. The special effects in this movie are seriously plain dumb and incredibly boring and the film even suffered from Bad CGI effects.\n5) Fifth there's too much characters in this movie.  Unlike the first one there's just a few characters but here there's too much which makes the new Mortal Kombat movie even dumber and dumber.\n6) And last but not least the new casts in the new Mortal Kombat movie seriously didn't make any sense at all. I mean come on the new actor who played Johnny Cage (Chris Conrad) wasn't as good as the other actor who played Johnny Cage in the original movie (Linden Ashby from the first movie). The new Sonya Blade (Sandra Hess) was also terrible I mean seriously the other actress who played Sonya in the first movie (Bridgette Wilson) was much more better than the new actress in this sequel. The other actress who played Sindel was seriously awful with her performance.  And last but not least the actor who played Shao Kahn was even worse than the other new casts in the film. Only Robin Shou who played Liu Kang in the original was the only actor who did a better job in the sequel the same also to Keith Cooke who played Reptile in the first movie and now he even did a better job with his performance as the younger version of Sub Zero in the sequel. Talisa Soto (the actress who played princess Kitana in the first movie)  did a better job with her performance as Princess Kitana in the sequel. The only new casts who did a better job in Mortal Kombat Annihilation is James Remar who plays Raiden in the sequel along with J.J. Perry who plays Scorpion in the sequel and the new actor who plays Jax in the sequel are the only new casts who did a better job in the sequel along with Robin Shou and Talisa Soto while the rest seriously went down the hill.\nOverall Mortal Kombat Annihilation gets a 2/10 because the movie has no plot. The film has pointless fight scenes. Bad directing. The film suffers from Boring special effects and really bad CGI effects. Too much characters and the new casts seriously ruined the entire film.",

We get goofier performances, worse dialog, and uglier special effects. The plot goes into a bunch of mystical mumbo jumbo. It tries to go grander in scale than it's predecessor, but it all just leads to poorer writing.\r We still get the entertaining fights though. The movie definitely doubles down on the fan service. Just like the first movie it's strength is in watching the game characters fight each other with over-the-top action. These fights are backed up by an awesome soundtrack.\r It tries to go bigger than it's predecessor and ends up falling short as a result. It also gets quite a bit cheesier. However when it's focusing on the first movie's strengths (cheesy martial arts action with fan favorite MK characters) it's still pretty entertaining. The expanded roster of characters taken from the games still makes it worth a watch for fans of the series and of the first movie. The lack of R-rated fatalities is still a disappointing non-inclusion, but no more so than it was in the first. Overall the movie just isn't as good this time around.",

Within the first five minutes they just go ahead and kill one of the beloved main characters of the first film. I think I could choreograph better action and the special effects are the worst that have ever existed. There is literally a  scene where both the protagonist and the antagonist turn into claymation dragons that fight each other. Robot Chicken has higher quality stop motion animation than this movie. All the actors from the beginning were strapped to wires, as everyone is just unrealistic flying and punching through the air in a way that would only make Joel Schumacher proud. Ten minutes in and you want the film to end. I'm surprised I sat through the whole thing. I can honestly say this is the worst video game to film adaptation. Uwe Boll needs to step up his game if he wants to claim the title.",

So while there are a number of characters in game 3 they incorporate a few game 2 characters as well. In order to provide screen time for all the characters they jump from one scene to the next without any real logical connection between them. Just too much was going on had they extended it (possibly made 2 films) and given it a bit of story and provided a bit of character development like the first movie rather than just a bunch of fight sequences to showcase all the characters it could have been good instead of the mess that was actually provided.",
