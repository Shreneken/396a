            "content": "The TV guide described the two leads in _KoHD_ as terminally ill gangsters, so when I came to watch it I discovered something quite different from what I had expected._KoHD_ is an excellent film that blends facets of gangster, buddy, road movie, comedy and drama genres together into a seamless whole.  Initially, Martin and Rudi are, of course, hopelessly mismatched.  As they travel towards the sea (their ultimate goal), the relationship between the two men begins to change.  The nervous Rudi finds strength and confidence; Martin, on the other hand, who is initially by far the stronger of the pair, comes to rely more upon Rudi for strength and assistance.Much have been made of the comedy in _KoHD_, and this is a major component - it is the humour that makes the film (which could have been utterly bleak) ultimately an uplifting experience.  That being said, however, just when you forget that both men are dying you are reminded forcefully that they are both, as the title suggests, knocking on heaven's door.  These two forces - the pathos and the comedy - provide a wonderful balance.  Thumbs up.",

            "content": "First of all, WHY HAS THIS FILM NOT BEEN RELEASED IN ENGLISH SPEAKING COUNTRIES??!!  Is it because Hollywood is afraid of German films that are actually as good as theirs?  Is it because this is a foreign film that isn't \"foreign\" enough (e.g. Bergmanesque symbolism or Wender's \"poetic imagery\") or is it because neither America nor Britain have the nerve to properly dub this film into English? In any case, the world is missing out.  This is a highly entertaining film with a simple plot, lots of humor, plenty of action, and two terrific leads. The plot, regardless of how many people will compare it to \"pulp fiction\" (a comparrison, by the way, which I simply cannot understand,)is a straight-forward buddy flick about two terminally ill men in their early thirties.  Like all buddy movies, (Lethal Weapan, 48 hours, Nothing to lose) the characters couldn't be more different at the beginning, and find a way to get along by the films end.  Nothing new here, except for the fact that both men know they will be dead by the film's end, thus eliminating (thank goodness) any chance of a sequel. Anyway, our heroes meet in the hospital, and quickly decide that they want to really \"live\" their final days on earth, and see the ocean before they pass away.  They steal a car which happens to belong to a dutch gangster (brief cameo by rutger hauer).  Thus begins the chase across Germany and Holland, a chase which combines road-movie laughs a-la Dumb and Dumber (there is a VERY similiar scene where the two men find the suitcase filled with money, and check into a rediculously fancy hotel) with genuine character development and bonding, a-la Thelma and Louise.The real star of the film is not the plot, but the little moments of genuine humor and tenderness between the leads.  Director Thomas Jahn's balance between over-the-top action-comedy and emotional \"cancer drama\" is amazingly played out by the two actors (til schweiger and jan josef liefers)I would recommend this film to ANYBODY who likes to be entertained.  The music is great, the jokes (most of them, at least) fly, and the relationships are genuine.  The only problem is probably that at this point, you have to speak German fluently to understand most of what's going on. BUT BE PATIENT!  Someday Hollywood will discover this film and at least SUBTITLE it like they did the equally terrific(er) \"lola rennt\".  My only hope is that they don't simply ruin the film by remaking it with american stars.  That would be a great letdown, because this film is already perfect. I doubt that most people would even think it's foreign, if they simply forget the subtitles and get into it.",

            "content": "This is another one of those films that I have seen a while back, and I'm somewhat surprised that I haven't actually written anything about it. Maybe it was because I watched it prior to starting to write reviews on movies, though since I watched it back in the days of the SBS cult movie show, I'm sure I would have been writing about it then. Anyway, this is one of those films that is an absolutely delight, and a right laugh - the fact that it is German just adds to it.Basically it is about these two guys, both of them in the late stages of incurable diseases, one of them having an inopperable brain tumor, the other having bone cancer. While they are lying in their hospital beds realising that this is the last place they are going to be, they basically say 'stuff it', steal a baby blue Mercedes, that happens to have a million dollars in the back, and go for a cruise to the beach, namely because neither of them have seen the sea. Mind you, Baby Blue Mercedes tend not to just be lying about the place, particularly if there is something like a million dollars in the boot, and if they are, then you probably don't want to get on the wrong side of the people that actually own it.Yeah, we have a couple of incompetent goons who are supposed to be delivering a package to somebody, but these guys just can't get anything right. So, after knocking a kid off his skate board, they leave the car, unlocked, with the key behind the visor, and take him into the hospital. Oh, and our heroes are wearing nothing but their pyjamas, so because they basically have nothing left to lose, a crime spree is also on the cards, though of course only one of them happens to be a criminal, the other is basically just along for the ride, and the police all think he is a hostage anyway.Yet there is more to this film that a couple of goof ball crooks, and two guys that are taking advantage of their last few days left on Earth, there is some pretty confronting drama as well. The thing is that these guys are dying, and this isn't hidden away - in fact in many cases it is front and centre. In a way it is also a quest, a quest to get to the sea, because, well, there is just something magical about the sea. Yet it also makes you wonder what one would actually do if you literally had nothing left to lose, therefore no need to abide by those social restraints.This is actually a pretty bleak movie, but it is also very entertaining - a black comedy if you will. In fact some have suggested that it could almost be considered Germany's Pulp Fiction. Look, personally, I don't think so, though it does come pretty close. However, in many cases it is a film that pretty much stands on its own two feet, and it is also one of those films that you simply could not remake, even if it is to appeal to the English speaking world. In a way it is made in such a way that the skill and artistry of the director pretty much means that nobody ccould build upon what he has already created.",

            "content": "\"Knocking On Heaven's Door\" has been a big German box office hit in the winter of 1996/97 and is still considered one of the best German movies of that decade next to the international success \"Lola rennt\". This is a breath-taking comedy about two losers (Til Schweiger and Jan-Josef Liefers) dying of cancer and getting anything they want during their last days on earth. They are robbing a bank and nicking a car containing a gangster's suitcase with a million marks in it. Of course the gangsters and the police hunting the guys who just want to reach the sea to die somewhere at the shore.Although this road-movie story itself isn't very new and has been filmed many times in Hollywood movies, it stands on its own. The story has dozens of quotes and references from American movies and film genres, but it also knows how to add a local, German and European style to it. You see two henchmen, a Turk and a Belgian, dressed in black suits and with sunglasses like taken from a Tarantino film. You see Hannes Jaenicke dressed as a fatally-looking leather cop U.S.A. style, drinking Jaegermeister (a popular German spice liquor). You see popular fifties girlie actress Conny Froboess playing Til Schweiger's mum, an Elvis Presley adoring fan.\nThere are plenty of funny scenes in this movie, many witty dialogues, absurd situations and brilliant performances by all actors featuring Corinna Harfouch as a doctor, \"Sexluder\" Jenny Elvers as a nurse, Dutch movie stars Huub Stapel and Rutger Hauer as gangster bosses, Ralf Herforth as dumb police officer, etc. Schweiger and Liefers are giving the best performances of their career, adding pain, sadness and tragedy to the all-action-comedy style. The photography, editing and the surf-rock-like sound track by Selig are also outstanding. Take a look at this example of best German nineties cinema!!!",

Perhaps it's about the ultimate goal, that everyone has and hasn't got time to fulfill it, and when the moment comes that makes one understand 'now is the right time'. Sometimes it's too late, sometimes one never understands it is time to change something, but for those two, life was a success. Quoting matrix (kill me), it's the \"free your mind\" style, when all problems go away and you can do whatever you want to do. It's actually a very thrilling experience, and hope this movie can inspire someone to change something in the rhythm of life they're currently living. I like movies that make you think different of things, and this surely is one that does so.",

We always think we have a lot of time to do things we want to do, but nobody knows what will happen tomorrow. We never have the courage to do something derailed from our normal track of life, and gradually lost the aim and fun of it, living numbly and waiting to the final destination.The cast is good and I Love Til Schweiger so much, really a charming role!

In this movie he show it, in the movies after this not any more... One of the best things in this movie is that it never become ridiculous and don't get to sadly.

Also very good is the performance of Moritz Bleibtreu, who became well-known, because of his great play of a turkish-german gangster.

            "content": "\"Knockin' on Heaven's Door\" is a German film from almost 20 years ago that was written and directed by Thomas Jahn. It is easily his most known work to this day. It stars Til Schweiger, Jan Josef Liefers and Moritz Bleibtreu, a trio that could be considered the most known actors here in Germany right now. Fittingly, this film here is among the best-known German films too, also abroad. It is not a long movie, only runs for under 90 minutes and that includes a fair share of closing credits already.The film covers several areas, crime story, comedy, drama, moments of tragedy and how you deal with it etc. Certainly a very versatile film. Still I must say that to me it never really delivered 100% in any of these areas. It was not as touching as I hoped it would be and not as funny either Bleibtreu won a German Film Award for his performance here and I also liked Til Schweiger. Nice to see him get some awards recognition, easily one of his best performances, maybe even his very best. He is not the greatest actor in terms of range, but he frequently makes up for it through charisma. On the downside, this also confirms that Jan Josef Liefers is really not a particularly good actor at all. It sure takes a fair share of mediocrity to be clearly inferior to an actor like Schweiger, but Jan Josef Liefers succeeded. He is another actor who scored through charisma instead of talent and his popularity is absolutely not justified by his range.Anyway, the story here is probably the most interesting thing. Frequently, it feels extremely absurd, but if you approach this film by seeing it as fiction instead of reality, it can be a good experience. Nothing bad here, but nothing great either. All in all, a decent watch and I recommend it. Many familiar faces from German film in here.",

By intention this movie is far from realism. For example, you never see symptoms of illness at Rudi, despite he is very sick of bone cancer. There are lot of gunfights, but no one dies or gets hurt. In one scene dozens of police cars chase the two guys. The two main gangsters, Henk and Abdul, are in their black suits a mixture of Tarantino-style guys and the typical german smalltown thug.

Inserted are all types of clich\u00e9s (from respected actor Moritz Bleibtreu as a dumb Arab mumbling in bad German, to the sentimental ending in the North-Sea-sunset). What really annoyed me is the dull kind of humor blank of every subtlety, which the movie celebrates from the beginning to the end. To say something positive, the camera word is fresh and at times inventive. As an example for a well-done and funny German comedy, see \"Frau Rettich, die Czerni und ich\" from 1998.

The two goons, who are hired to get the car back act terribly and fulfill every clich\u00e9 in the book. Til Schweiger really sucks at trying to be a sensitive macho. And all that talk about getting to the sea sounds like it's part of some low-level chick-flick.I really didn't enjoy a minute of this movie (the second time i watched it).I don't mean to offend anybody who actually watched this movie and liked it i just think that it doesn't deserve a rating 7.6. That would make it as watchable as 'Carlito's Way' (the older one), 'High Fidelity', 'Kontroll' (very good Hungarian movie), just slightly worse than House of the flying daggers' and even better than 'Chasing Amy'. Not that those movies are the best ones ever made. But i think all those movies are better than 'Knocking on Heaven's Door' and don't deserve the same rating. That's why i would give it a 4. Also i don't think that Quentin Tarantino would appreciate this movie to be compared with Pulp Fiction.",

            "content": "Tragicomedy. Finally, a pancake miracle happened! Open the champagne! I treat everyone at my own expense! How long had to wait. Don't you understand what's the matter? So I'll tell you now, the fact is that I wanted to see this picture ten years ago. Ten years old Karl! But everything did not work out, then business, then study, then work, then other paintings were very much asked to be viewed and reviewed. And now, after I repeat - ten years later, I saw this magnificent and wonderful picture, which all my friends and acquaintances sincerely advised me to see even then, and here's my brief opinion - Oh, to die, so with music! I confess that I am completely delighted with this picture, and I would like not to write about some of the minuses that I saw, but I will write in a separate paragraph, while they do not spoil the overall impression, so let me focus on the expressive merits of this masterpiece tragicomedy German production.\nSo, here they are:\n1. The story told - the picture tells the story of two guys, Rudy and Martin, who, after a planned medical examination, find out that they are terminally ill, and they have only a few days to live. A common misfortune united, and they decided not to wait for death in a hospital ward - but to fulfill their dreams and live the fun time they had allotted. Add here an expensive car with a lot of money, a competent and well-developed script, for which the director Thomas Jan himself and Til Schweiger, who plays Martin, were responsible - and you will get an hour and a half of pure pleasure. In general, the script was written with pure enthusiasm, as you can see. But, if you go deeper, this is not just a story of a binge of two terminally ill - they put their soul into the script, and this can be seen with the naked eye. This is a deep and soulful story.\n2. Inner depth - I already started writing about this in fithe previous paragraph. The viewer literally becomes involved in the heroes' problems. The heroes' dreams become our dreams, we worry about them. And even more so, what would we have done in their place (God forbid from such things), but still? I am sure that the majority would not quietly and calmly wait for the old woman with a scythe, but would have rushed out of the hospital and would have gone all out, adjusted for each, of course. They would fulfill their dreams, accomplish what they feared earlier, would fill the remaining time with a riot of colors, in order to meet the old woman with a scythe, peaceful and happy, and go to Heaven without having nasty thoughts and feelings of a life wasted in vain.\n3. Humor - for the most part it is still a comedy, which even reminded me of \"Taxi\", but there were only three frankly hilarious moments here - but what kind! I can't say who was responsible for these jokes (Thomas or Thiel), but I shake hands with both! My sincere respect and admiration!\n4. Music - almost every viewer on our planet knows most of it, because the songs are not only well-known, they have also become cult, in fact, the original name refers to the cult song \"Knockin 'on Heaven's Door\" by the famous American singer Bob Dylan. Well, for the music that sounds in touching and sentimental moments - special thanks. Excellent selection, my compliments to the composers.\n5. Dialogues - especially about the sea - you can listen to it endlessly. By God, in performance it reminded me very much of the famous scene in the cult film \"Blade Runner\", where the hero of Rutger Hauer (who also appeared here in a small role) pronounces in the same languid voice. This, this, this is great! It seems like ordinary and everyday words, but how it sounds! Wonderful!\n6. Final - the famous final, where everything is clear without words. Magnificent shots, facial expressions of characters, emotions, surroundings, music - they told me about him even then, ten years ago, but this knowledge did not diminish my delight when I saw him with my own eyes. Magnificent and burning!\nWell, the cons, as promised, must be mentioned (although fans and admirers of the picture will throw stones at you for this), let's start: a few scenario miscalculations, the police behave very stupidly (even by the standards of Taxi), several dark scenes where there was clearly not enough lighting technology. That's all. A little, but as I said - all this does not affect the overall impression.\nA little about the main characters:\n1. Martin Brest performed by Til Schweiger is a serious guy who loves smoking with or without reason, charismatic, but with good humor, whose life turned upside down in an instant. At first, it may not cause sympathy, but soon the viewer already becomes interested in watching him and his friend in misfortune, Rudy. One of Thiel Schweiger's best films (if not the best). Well done!\n2. Rudy Wurlitzer performed by Jan Josef Lifers is a modest and law-abiding boy, for whom the news of a fatal illness was a real blow. But the acquaintance with the impudent Martin breathed new life into him, and fun began. Jan played this role very convincingly.\nThe picture did not collect a very large box office, which affected the director Thomas Yana, who no longer shot a single picture.\nWell, you don't wait as long as I did. Look at the picture right now. And if you have already watched it, then review it, because it deserves it. Is that so? This picture is from the category that does not lose its relevance and charm when viewed again, but on the contrary, with each revision it only gets better. Is not it so?\nAs a result, we have a masterpiece and cult tragicomedy about two terminally ill guys who made a real revelry goodbye, with an excellent script, jokes, music and excellent dialogues and moral conclusions.",

            "content": "Knockin on Heavens Door is my number 120 movie, because it is a fun action movie and it has good characters. I'm German, so I almost have to like this movie. I especially loved Abdul, the guy with the Turkish accent, played by Moritz Bleibtreu, who is a famous German actor. Maybe you know him from Lola rennt ( 1998 ). In Lola rennt he played Manni, the guy who has to get 20,000 DM within 20 minutes. The story : Martin Brest ( Til Schweiger ) has a tumor in his head and Rudi Wurlitzer ( Jan Josef Liefers ) is afflicted by cancer in his bones. Rudi has never seen the sea in his life, so it is a point of honor for Martin to get him there. During their trip they meet two car dealers ( Moritz Bleibtreu and Thierry van Werveke ). Martin and Rudi rob a bank, and steal a car of these two car dealers. But finally they get to the sea. Knockin on Heavens Door is a good German film with good characters + actors and a great soundtrack ( Knockin on Heavens Door by Selig ) . My favorite part in this film is the ending when that soundtrack is played. It stands for that there is always hope and so on. It is just a great ending.All in all, I rated Knockin on Heavens Door 8/10 and recommend it to fans who want to see fun movies. I consider KoHd as one of the best German films, along Lola rennt ( 1998 ), Die Br\u00fccke ( 1959 ), Das Boot ( 1981 ), Stalingrad ( 1993 ) and Der Name der Rose ( 1986 ).

            "content": "Two young guys Rudi (Jan Josef Liefers) and Martin (Til Schweiger) being examined at the same time find out that they are terminally ill and have very little time left to live. And fate brought them together in one room. So the choice arises: to die quietly in the ward or to break away for the last time. Having drunk, they decide to fulfill their cherished dream - to go to the sea, which they have never been to, because in heaven they only talk about it. And an exciting story begins, in which there is everything: beautiful girls, money, a sky-colored car, chases, gunfights, funny situations and reckless actions.It is difficult to attribute the film to any one genre, here comedy, drama, action movie are intertwined and it all looks holistic, every moment, every detail and every phrase has a certain meaning. A story about the thirst for life, about real friendship that arose in a short time, about how friendship can influence people, forcing them to do seemingly unthinkable things.The last desire of both is interesting: the unceremonious Martin thinks in his last desire not about himself, but about a loved one, and the quiet Rudy wants to satisfy his sexual fantasy.Speaking about the main characters, one cannot but say that Leavers and Schweiger performed their role simply brilliantly. Throughout the film, with every second, you become more and more saturated with sympathy for their heroes, and you want their dream to come true.There are enough interesting characters in the film besides Rudy and Martin. The brightest Abdul with Hank and their boss Frankie. Abdul doesn't like when they *bring* his patience, can't drive, doesn't get into jokes even the third time, loves beautiful costumes, constantly pronounces words with errors, and Hank corrects him and makes sure that he doesn't break loose and do another stupid thing . Frankie pretends to be a big boss, he is constantly not happy with a couple of his guys, he considers them idiots. This criminal trinity evokes sympathy and makes you smile, although they are negative characters.The finale of the picture will squeeze out a tear from anyone. Here is a feeling of joy that they succeeded, they still did it, and bitterness because this is the end. Rudy and Martin are so attracted to themselves, they make them relive their last moments with them that tears involuntarily well up. Everything is just great: a cigarette, a bottle of tequila, the sea and all this to the beautiful song of Selig - *Knockin On Heaven's Door*\nAfter the finale, you understand that the film also puts before you the question, what will you talk about in heaven. You understand that so many things have not been done yet, so many things you want to try, but time does not wait. What are you capable of to achieve your dreams, how far are you willing to go? You involuntarily put yourself in the place of Rudy and Martin and ask yourself if I am ready for crazy things. Why only on the verge of death do you understand that you should not be afraid to live, because every day can be the last. Why do you understand the meaning of the phrase *live every day as if it were your last* when the end is near. Why do we whine that life is boring and meaningless, why don't we spit on everyone who stands between us and the realization of our dreams. Maybe it's time to change something, stop being afraid, do something crazy. Start fulfilling your dream. Or he can spit on everything and go to the sea.You cannot be indifferent to the film, it will definitely sink into your soul and stay there forever.This masterpiece is beyond all bounds, everyone should see it!",

Since they gathered in paradise, and in paradise all the talk is only about the sea...I watched the movie and realized that all these aspirations are only because life is slipping away. If they had not received these terrible diagnoses, they would have wasted their lives ...The film is shot simply amazing. It was filmed by three countries: Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands in 1997.German actor Til Schweiger - well, you can't take your eyes off him. Beautiful, plastic, sexy. But I never thought that he would be so delightfully good in a \"death role\". Everything is natural, clear, the hit of the actor is 100%. I think that the authors were lucky with the selection of actors.I think the plot and the speed with which it develops are huge pluses.I like the musical arrangement and the ability of the authors to switch from tragic moments to subtle humor.I like the film very much.

Despite the fact that the theme of the movie is very serious, it is a great comedy. The main message of the film is \"Fear is stupid\". This movie makes you rethink your vision of life and leaves behind a sense of sadness and, at the same time the ease. It leaves you feeling the sea breeze on your face after watching. There is an interesting fact: this movie is full of so-called \"movie flubs\". For example, in one shot we can see legs of the camera crew, in the other - the crew is reflected in the glasses pf one of the actors, etc. Although I watched the film numerous times, I'd never noticed these flubs, until I read about them on the one website. For me this is a sign of the plot completely preoccupying the audience. I think that it's one of the movies you can watch over and over again and \"update\" your feelings and emotions on the transience of life and the absurdity of many of the conventionalities.",

But that this is a German movie is nearly unbelievable.I think it's very sad that this great piece of work wasn't released in the United States. This is probably one the greatest German movies ever made but only a few \"Not-Germans\" are able to see it. Perhaps there will be a subtitled version on the American market soon!

During the travel they make one wish of each other come true.We won't have another life, make dreams come true, do what you feared before. Never put off till tomorrow what you can do today.

The storyline is very creative and leaves a lot of space for surprises, the acting is fresh and really makes you feel with the main characters. The movie promises comedy, action and drama...so be prepared. It doesn't reach my 10 points, missing a bit of professionalism sometimes but in the end this makes it just more likable! So, even if it's not available in English, make the effort and watch it with the subtitles. In the end it's always better to watch movies in original language.",

Til SCHWEIGER, i must call him the Brad PITT of GERMANY really performed well in his role as the tough guy, who really don\u00b4t give a damn. Despite the sadness, that both main characters are infected with deadly diseases, it really took me to laugh for several times. It has a touch of PULP Fiction and Natural Born KILLAZ in it. The only difference to that, there\u00b4s no blood in it, makes it more realistic. The funniest part is ABDUL, one half of the gangster-duo, watch him and his broken german language. Overall a great entertaining movie made by a german team.",

Morever, we have watched other movie \"Bucket List\" before about two old man which scape hospital near their dead times. But \"knockin' on Heaven's door\" distinguish itself somehow from others by some different aspects. I think one of this different aspects exists about \"Aura\" concept! From my point of view, in this film there is an invisible aura around major characters and this aura protects them from all the dangerous things around them. Look at the sequence which they have been besieged from two sides by gangsters and police officers; however, they can run away. there is a spectacle Mise-en-scene here,too. Some vertical camera angles which shoot from up in the sky and exhibiting how that invisible aura protects two young man. \"knockin' on Heaven's Door\" is a lovable movie because there is an aura around it which make us an obligation for loving it!",
