            "content": "i honestly don't understand the low rating this movie has on this site.I'll admit it's no masterpiece,but it is vastly entertaining.to me,Leslie Nielson is perfectly cast as Mr.Magoo.if you don't know the character of Mr.Magoo,he was originally a cartoon character who is absurdly near sighted,leading him into all kinds of trouble,yet he is generally oblivious to most of what's going on.oh yeah,he is also very wealthy.the live action movie portrays the character pretty much exactly the same.he always seems to come out of any potential trouble with virtually no signs of any problem.in the movie,Magoo,helps solve a crime and help put the baddies in jail,with a lot of help,from both his nephew and his dog.yes,i said dog.this dog is is very intelligent and saves Magoo from many mishaps,both minor and major.Kelly Lynch portrays one of the criminals and she does a very fine job in her role.not to mention she is hot,hot,hot.anyway,like i said earlier,the movie is certainly very amusing,and contains an absolutely hysterical sequence with Magoo in the kitchen.there's also some great action and some great martial arts moves,courtesy of Lynch's character.for the most part,this is a great family movie,with maybe a bit of mild language.for me,the live action version of Mr.Magoo is an 8.5/10,based simply on how entertaining it is.",

            "content": "Mr Magoo is as wealthy as he is short-sighted and it is this combination that sees him trapped in the museum he is patron of late one night, when a robbery occurs. The CCTV footage makes him look like he was in on it and the FBI/CIA investigation focuses on him as they try to locate a stolen diamond while keeping the robbery on the low-down. Meanwhile, as he fishes, Magoo manages to have the stolen jewel dropped into his fishing box (best not to ask how) and thus is unwittingly pursued by thieves and cops.OK. This is based on a old cartoon character so I tried to ignore the modern PC outrage over this film by disabled groups protesting the depiction of partial blindness. According to IMDb it was this that saw the film sliding into video obscurity however I beg to differ. I was outraged by this film \u0096 but not for the reasons of objecting to the fact that it gets laughs out of a disability, but rather the fact that it totally fails to get laughs out of a disability. I'd love to pretend to be politically correct and sensitive but there we go! No, the main problem I had with the film is that it is simply not funny. Obviously the gags are all pretty obvious and can be seen coming from miles off but it still surprised me by how lazy it all was.The plot makes no sense but this was perhaps to be expected, however the total delivery is poor. A constantly \"wacky\" score is forced upon us in a desperate attempt to make us believe that it is hilarious when it is not. Nielsen was a great choice for the lead but even he can do nothing with this rot and in failing to improve it he just becomes part of the problem. The support cast features turns from Garner, Hudson, Tobolowsky, Lynch, Ferrer and McDowell all of whom are either wasted, look embarrassed or both. As director Tong seems to worry that the jokes will surprise his audience and, I assume, fearing injury from split sides, makes sure that we all get a chance to see each and every gag coming from quite a distance.Overall then, a film that will appeal to few audience demographics outside of children and those currently drunk. The jokes are obvious and lazy and all that is left is a terrible plot that (perhaps correctly) assumes the audience has the IQ of a basket and just hopes that a man stumbling around is enough to make it \u0096 for me personally, it wasn't.",

First of all, Leslie Nielsen is one of the funniest actors alive, and I personally like movies in which the characters just happen to walk right into a worst case scenario. And after three Naked Gun movies, who's better qualified for that job than Leslie Nielsen. In this movie, Nielsen's character, Mr. Magoo, has to solve the case of a stolen ruby from his mueseum. Coming along with him are his dog, Angus and his nephew, Waldo. To those of you who saw the film and hated it, remember, the film is directed toward kids and Disney fans.

Leslie Nielsen has made a career of acting in screwball comedy. He seems to fit his role well as the famously weak-eyed character.  In this day and age of political correctness, making a movie such as this was bound to raise a few hackles.  The little disclaimer run by Disney about the blind should give you an idea what the PC movement has done to movies today. The point of the cartoon was not to put down the blind at all.

            "content": "There's a part of me that knows what a godawful, scattershot mess Mr. Magoo is. That part of me begs reason, implores myself to recognize the boldfaced stupidity and flagrant dips into shameless, moronic lowbrow humour barely worthy of a troupe of chimps. There's also another part of me that absolutely loves the movie for all of the reasons just outlined. OK, so I watched it a lot as a kid, and have that nostalgia for it that one can only have with a fond childhood memory of something. But even so, all ridiculousness taken into account, it's a silly bit of fun that doesn't quite capture the tone of the famous cartoon, but fires away on its own whacko cylinders for ninety minutes of eyebrow raising, idiotic bliss. Leslie Nielsen, who has made a career of playing disastrous buffoons, portrays Mr. Magoo, a near sighted elderly gent whose visual impairment leads him on all sorts of adventures and odd situations, which the movie doesn't hesitate to illustrate in bold, silly fashion that gives the animated source material a run for its money. When a valuable foreign jewel which his charitable foundation is tasked with presenting is stolen, he and his asinine nephew Waldo (terminally awkward Matt Keesler) are led on a goose chase to find the two thieves, laughably sultry Kelly Lynch and dimbulb Nick Chinlund. That's about as far as plot goes, and it's all the blueprint you need for the cascade of slapstick muck that bombards your good taste for the better part of an hour and a half. One has to give credit to the stunt crew, who create scene after scene of madness for Nielsen and crew to parade through, from a snow chase on an ironing board, to a South American waterfall derby and all kinds of messiness in between. Some truly talented people got dragged into this, including Jennifer Garner as an Eastern European (HA!), Stephen Tobolowsky as an overzealous, bumbling fed who borders on certifiable, beloved Ernie Hudson as another law enforcement stooge, Miguel Ferrer as a Peruvian drug lord, and the one and only Malcolm McDowell as a sinister crime boss (who else?). The Vancouver locations are cool, especially an over the top Grouse Mountain set showdown. Like I said, it's a whole lot of dumb dumb, and don't say I didn't warn you. But it's also so much Fricken fun, man.",

The character has come under fire for mocking the disabled because of his deafness but he really is the hero each time and it makes a change for a hero to not be in full compliment of his faculties. The film tries but fails to capture the true magic of the bumbler from the cartoons but Leslie Nielsen looks uncomfortable here as more serious roles suit him better. Mr Magoo was always a two joke affair: 1) He couldn't see well and 2) he always made little quips and remarks to himself. Not something that would lend itself easily to an hour+ motion picture. In this case, the late Nielsen's charisma and a few decent gags make this run-of-the-mill, late 90's Disney-cartoon-adaptation a little more tolerable than most of its despised peers.Overall rating: 6 out of 10.",

Along the way, there are car chases, boat chases, and helicopter chases.  There are even baboon chases.  Will be stunning jewel end up with the good guys of the film (such as Mr. Magoo) or will it ultimately be taken by the thieves?This film is by no means a gem of a movie.  Yet, it is watchable (especially the second half) and mildly humorous.  Kelly Lynch seems to relish her role as a female thief.  Mr. Magoo also keeps a little English bulldog whose appearances are always welcome.  This viewer purchased the video for $1.00 at the secondhand store and feels she got her money's worth and more.

Unfair comparison. Those movies were made with adults in mind, even if teens were more its market. But \"Mr. Magoo\" is definitely for young children. I loved hearing my youngest cackle every few minutes. And frankly, by letting myself just be a kid for 88 minutes, I found myself laughing here and there and the cuter gags. Oh, and I'm sorry, but that scene with Magoo not realizing his cooking channel got switched to an aerobics channel and starting to do the workout with his chicken is comic genius.

As for Mr Magoo, I don't think it was that bad. It was far from perfect, being a little too short and have a story that was on the predictable side.But I do think it is underrated, I thought it was entertaining and fun which is more than I can say for some of the movies I hate, some of which are only a couple of notches higher than this one (ie. Freddy Got Fingered). As for the rating, I do think 3.4 is too low, around the 5.9-6.0 region is more like it.So what did I like about Mr Magoo? Well the fact I was entertained by it helped. The script is amusing, and there are some fun gags, including a hilarious scene in the kitchen. The film does look reasonably good too with good locations and the photography and editing doesn't look as cheap as one might think. The soundtrack is suitably upbeat, the film moves quickly and the direction is pretty decent. And the acting was at least okay too, Nielson was a genius when it came to comedy and while he has been better he does seem to be enjoying himself and Mr Magoo himself is a fun and likable character. Out of the supporting cast, Ernie Hudson, Miguel Ferrer and especially Malcolm McDowell were fun, and Jennifer Garner was okay.All in all, the film is far from perfect but it wasn't bad either. 8/10 Bethany Cox",

The plot revolves around the theft of a huge ruby. Of course, given the comic and stereotyped kind of film and characters, I didn't expect a lot of verisimilitude on this plot, so I wasn't disappointed by it, but I understand those who has something to say on this. The lead character is played by Leslie Neilsen, an actor who has become a synonym for comedy and doesn't leave us disappointed. He is great at his work and manages to bring charm and joy to the character, making him enjoyable. Jokes are generally good but, after some time, we have already guessed what will happen. The rest of the cast does a fairly decent supporting job but doesn't have room for do much more. Villains are usually as clumsy as Magoo except for Luanne, a cunning and seductive villain played by Kelly Lynch.The big problem with this movie is that it ends up being a guilty pleasure. We're laughing at a blind man, a handicapped person, and that makes us feel a little guilty and angry at the movie. The truth is that today it's fashionable to be politically correct, and I cannot think of a more politically incorrect character than Mr. Magoo, as lovely as he can be. The film itself seems to have this awareness, allowing the audience to guess the jokes before they happen and avoiding discomfort. Its super funny and has quality, but was punished by the public due to this feeling of guilt.",

The running gag in the cartoon was that Mr. Magoo couldn't see well and always ended up colliding into all kinds of mayhem. As for this film, which is live-action, director Stanley Tong did a good job keeping the realism of the cartoon the same. Mr. Magoo still goes up, down, left and right in this film like he was on an invisible roller coaster. What surprised me the most about this film was that Disney sponsored it.Starring as the infamous Mr. Magoo is Leslie Nielsen. What's neat, is that in beginning you actually get to see the transition from cartoon life into real life. Of course not many people will notice at first, but cartoon Magoo doesn't have hair but when Leslie Nielsen is on screen, he does have hair. Even I didn't notice until much later, so my question remains, who forgot to make this cartoon look as accurate as possible? Its not really a big deal because Disney made the same mistake two years later when Inspector Gadget (1999) was made and they had Dr. Claw right out in the open; oh well. The other thing that's sort of ridiculous about the film are the physics behind certain scenes. Again, this is a cartoon adaptation so things are kept unrealistic but still some scenes come off as being almost impossible.This whole movie is made to look like everyone is idiotic. I must say that it was done well because everyone in this movie are idiots, but they are funny idiots. Nielsen is good at making it look like he knows whom he's talking to even though he doesn't. The two spies played by Ernie Hudson and Stephen Tobolowsky are funny to watch too. They either end up knocking each other over just to see who can get to the finish line first or they end up knocking each other out altogether. Nick Chinlund who plays another doofus named Bob Morgan tries to get his hands on Mr. Magoo. What a wreck that guy was.Miguel Ferrer, from RoboCop (1987), plays the main villain in this film. His character is called Ortega Peru and although he's a mean villain, he doesn't impose himself as a bad guy. I guess that's what you get for being bad guy in a silly Disney comedy. The music is good too; it has a giddy jumpiness to it, which goes well with what Mr. Magoo does in this film. Not every scene will have big laughs but it's a cute, goofy, and fun filled movie for the family. Kids will definitely love it.Disney took a chance and although they failed to impress critics and the majority of Magoo fans, it still has a little charm to it. The movie is silly fun that makes Magoo look like he can handle anything that's placed or thrown in his way, even though he can't which makes it all the more unrealistic for a live-action cartoon.",

Villains attempt to nab the ruby but with no success and the police bug Magoo's house believing him to be a suspect. Boring plot with no signs of potential with many predictable developments structured around Magoo's various misunderstandings and mishaps. Directed by Stanley Tong who previously made one of Jackie Chan's worst films, First Strike. Here he not only proves to know little if anything about the cartoon, but he also makes one of Leslie Nielsen's worst films. There are actors who do shitty films without the name stamping director to imply it. Magoo's nephew Waldo looks nothing like the guy in this film. He doesn't even act like the guy in this film. The river raft parachute scene also doesn't work. Leslie Nielsen would seem ideal choice to play Magoo but he is recycling variations of other roles in films much better and funnier than this. Even his bald headed makeup isn't convincing. Kelly Lynch, Malcolm McDowell and Ernie Hudson are wasted in pathetic cardboard supporting roles. Pointless portrayal of a cartoon that proves that more than Magoo had bad eye sight. Score: 1 / 10",

Those sorts of people are always a bit confused about when to laugh in the absence of a laugh track, and therefore fall back to judging comedies on the basis of plotting, characterisation, critic reviews, star charisma and a \"what have we learned today\" homily at the end. On the other hand, those of us with a sense of humour who see comedies because we want a good laugh would probably get quite a bit of enjoyment out of this one. While it's not up to the standard of (for instance) the ZAZ movies, and the plot is pretty silly and goes through some moan-inducing contortions in order to deliver its set pieces, many of the set pieces are laugh out loud funny. Like \"Jane Austen's Mafia\" and \"Guest House Paradiso\", this is another of those very funny but underappreciated slapstick-driven comedies which sacrifice narrative tightness and tedious romantic subplots for actual laughs.",

For what he's given, Leslie Nielsen (of THE NAKED GUN movies, who always tries) is ideally cast as the lovably nearsighted, clueless tycoon caught in a needlessly complicated and dragged-out plot concerning Magoo's accidental robbery of a precious ruby and the ruthless jewel thieves that are after it. With a lot of slapstick pratfalls and lame vision-impaired situations thrown in, the movie's biggest problem is that there's nothing funny-and hammers every joke flat.

And there weren't as much going on in the movie as there were in the cartoons. I mean in terms of things happening because of his lack of eyesight. Of course, it would be more difficult to do in a live action movie. But that is what \"Mr. Magoo\" was all about. So this movie was sort of a disappointment.Sure the movie was watchable, but it didn't live up to the legacy of the cartoons. And while Leslie Nielsen's comedy act definitely helped the movie along, it just wasn't sufficient to make it worthy of the cartoons.The storyline was adequate, but it just felt that it fell short of the classic \"Mr. Magoo\" animated series.What worked in favor of this 1997 movie was the cast. That was just rather impressive. I mean, aside from the wonderful Leslie Nielsen, the movie had the likes of Kelly Lynch, Stephen Tobolowsky, Ernie Hudson, Jennifer Garner, Malcolm McDowell and Miguel Ferrer on the cast list. So there were some pretty iconic 1990s names on the cast list. And the dog was just wonderful in the movie.I believe that I have seen the movie back in my teenage years, but had forgotten all about it. So I sat down to watch it again in 2020.

The plot revolves around the theft of a huge ruby. Of course, given the comic and stereotyped kind of film and characters, I didn't expect a lot of verisimilitude on this plot, so I wasn't disappointed by it, but I understand those who has something to say on this. The lead character is played by Leslie Neilsen, an actor who has become a synonym for comedy and doesn't leave us disappointed. He is great at his work and manages to bring charm and joy to the character, making him enjoyable. Jokes are generally good but, after some time, we have already guessed what will happen. The rest of the cast does a fairly decent supporting job but doesn't have room for do much more. Villains are usually as clumsy as Magoo except for Luanne, a cunning and seductive villain played by Kelly Lynch.The big problem with this movie is that it ends up being a guilty pleasure. We're laughing at a blind man, a handicapped person, and that makes us feel a little guilty and angry at the movie. The truth is that today it's fashionable to be politically correct, and I cannot think of a more politically incorrect character than Mr. Magoo, as lovely as he can be. The film itself seems to have this awareness, allowing the audience to guess the jokes before they happen and avoiding discomfort. Its super funny and has quality, but was punished by the public due to this feeling of guilt.",
