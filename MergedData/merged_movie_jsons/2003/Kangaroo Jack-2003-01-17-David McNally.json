            "content": "Two childhood friends, a New York hairstylist and a would-be musician, get caught up with the mob and are forced to deliver $50,000 to Australia, but things go haywire when the money is lost to a wild kangaroo.This film is notorious for its deceptive advertising. Everyone thought it would be about a talking kangaroo. And, after all, the film is called \"Kangaroo jack\", so it makes sense you would expect the lead character to be the kangaroo. But, in fact, the kangaroo does not talk, and has a relatively small part to play in the movie (even if he is the key figure to the whole plot).If you keep your expectations low, this is actually a fun film. Very predictable, sort of stupid, but watch it with some friends and you might just have a fun time. And it is pretty wholesome for the most part. Some mild violence, a bit of forced romance, but nothing too adult and hardly any curse words. That seems to be more and more rare these days (2015).As a special treat, one of the supporting cast members is Michael Shannon (and Christopher Walken has a small part). This is before Shannon really got noticed or came to be respected as a critical success. Watch him in this role, though. Despite it being a pretty awful film, Shannon shines. He gives it 100% even when Jerry O'Connell is happy just to get a paycheck.",

            "content": "RELEASED IN 2003 and directed by David McNally, \"Kangaroo Jack\" is a family-friendly adventure/comedy about two Brooklyn friends (Jerry O'Connell and Anthony Anderson) who are commissioned by a mob boss (Christopher Walken) to deliver $50,000 to a shady character in the Outback. The operation goes awry when a kangaroo inadvertently runs off with one of the guys' jacket... and the money. Michael Shannon is on hand as a mob heavy.This is a likable, amusing adventure flick with the typical eye-rolling kid humor (e.g. fart jokes). It's fun, harmless hokum highlighted by spectacular Australian cinematography and the beautiful Estella Warren as an Outback preservationist. The humorous camaraderie of the protagonists is another highpoint. But the story isn't as compelling as I hoped it would be and the camera never really captures Estella's beauty beyond her lovely face and pulchritude.THE FILM RUNS 1 hour, 29 minutes and was shot in Australia and Brooklyn with reshoots done in Los Angeles.GRADE: C+",

            "content": "I heard a story about the making of the film Kangaroo Jack. It was a dark story about mobsters putting out a hit on two young dudes who have been sent to the Australian outback who then inadvertently run over a Kangaroo.Test audiences were rather negative about the film but the feedback was that it could do with more kangaroo scenes and more comedy and the film was reshot, recut and marketed as a silly action comedy.Jerry O'Connell, Anthony Anderson, Estella Warren star in Kangaroo Jack with a cameo from Christopher Walken and an early appearance by Michael Shannon.Charlie Carbon (O'Connell) and Louis Booker (Anderson) became best buddies when Booker saved Carbon from drowning when he was a kid. Since then Booker has always got Carbon in trouble and in the latest escapade, both end up in trouble with Carbon's stepfather (Walken) a local mobster.To make amends they are sent to Australia to deliver a package but when they run over a kangaroo and put on a jacket on it to take pictures. The kangaroo revives and runs off wearing the jacket and with the package in the pocket. Before long they are being pursued by the people who were due to receive the package and Walken send some goons down under as well.Its actually undemanding fun and I rather enjoyed it. Its a silly romp, O'Connell and Anderson spark off each other, Warren is very appealing and the kangaroo provides the bounce.",

            "content": "Let's get to the point. Kangaroo Jack is necessarily the worst film of all time, but neither is it the greatest. It's not even close. What it is though is fairly humorous, though usually silly.The story is a bit good at parts, but far-fetched at others. Charlie and Louis were best friends ever since childhood, after one saved another from drowning. One of their fathers was a gangster or something, and the two are sent with a job to deliver the money to some other dude. The story isn't quite a bad one, and does take a little twist. (The twist is related to the job.) The main flaw in the story is that the movie is supposedly aimed at kids. Do you think kids will understand anything about mafia or anything like that?Despite that, there are other moments not aimed at kids. One of the jokes includes Charlie grabbing on of the other character's chest. Another scene includes a homophobic joke. (\"We're having an intimate, non-gay moment.) The film is a bit funny and entertaining, but the farting and homophobic jokes, along with the strange storyline makes it less than what it could have been, but I still enjoyed it more than other films such as The Cat in the Hat, Scary Movie and Dude, Where's My Car? 5/10Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment.",

Better than most Adam Sandler movies and minus all the language and sexual content that Sandler and others seem to sneak into movies they try and sell to \"kids\".  This is a typical O'Connell role and he plays it well. Estella Warren spices it up and keeps her integrity as an actress in check.  She looks good no matter what she does anyway but the movie does not lower her standards at all.  It is a great movie for the adults to laugh with and the kids in the theatre were having a blast.  Plus, anytime Movie Critics trash a film, the odds are it will be a weekend Number #1 movie and you will like it. It did $18 million on the open and will clear $40 mil easily. Not bad for the budget it was made with. Good Job Bruck... 6 stars out of 10....Have a great time and don't be to picky or critical. It is a movie about a Kangaroo after all!!",

It was - but only for a moment. It was advertised as fodder for kids. Well, it tends to remain in the general audience vein with brief strays into light-hearted sexual innuendo. No, here the kangaroo is simply incidental to the actual story which isn't that compelling to start with. It is mostly a CGI kangaroo and not always a very good one. When the animal is actually on the screen it tends to almost be annoying because it tends to come across as a commercial. Sort of like .... meanwhile, here is what the kangaroo is doing. It breaks up the storyline with somewhat lame attempts at the kangaroo trying to be funny. Completely unnecessary. As for the story - it could have actually been a good Mafia-lite film in a way. The resulting revelation about the purpose of the kangaroo hijacked envelope of money was the most interesting part of the film. There are some amusing sequences but nearly none have anything to do with the kangaroo. Why was the kangaroo billed as the star? I don't know. Even as the film ends the kangaroo soliloquies that he is the star and finally gets to performing in the way I originally thought the film was going to convey. By the end of the film I felt somewhat betrayed. I was waiting for a kangaroo that never really happened.",

            "content": "To be honest \"Kangaroo Jack\" isn't an horrible movie. It has some solid main characters and some good comical moments and situations but it is all ruined by the story that is totally without a point and lame. Who ever green-lighted this project?Even though he plays obviously a quite prominent role in the movie, the character of Kangaroo Jack feels totally out of place and not relevant for the movie. He feels totally pointless and makes the movie a very lame one to watch at times with some easy and childish humor and situations in it. Without his character this movie probably would had been a better one and certainly a more watchable one.The actors Jerry O'Connell and Anthony Anderson really don't form a bad comical duo but they are truly given awful material to work with at times. The movie feels like a waste of the two main characters. And what ever was Christopher Walken thinking? I still can't believe that he agreed to play a part in this movie. It's like having Marlon Brando in \"Plan 9 From Outer Space\". Totally out of place and below his professional level.The movie is good looking and it's obvious that director David McNally still has a notable talent for movie making. He still adds feeling and style to the movie even though it can't all conceal the movie its lame and pointless story.It's still good for a few laughs but it overall has more minuses than pluses in it, so I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone unless you're really bored.4/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

            "review_title": "False Advertising at its Most Obnoxious",
            "content": "More often than not, the studio behind a feature film will alter said feature in an attempt to improve its tone for a different audience, but seldom does it work out successfully. In the case of Kangaroo Jack, what started off as a PG-13 mob comedy known as Down & Under ended up transitioning into a PG family friendly crime comedy that tried focusing too much of its market value on a CGI rapping marsupial. Despite the film making a modest financial impact and a direct to DVD animated sequel, it was heavily panned on its release and is often regarded as one of the worst comedies in recent years, and for every reason imaginable.The main premise revolves around childhood friends Charlie Carbone and Louis Booker, who end up having to take money from Charlie's mob boss stepfather Sal Maggio and travel with it to Australia to deliver it to the proper folks. However, they accidentally run over a kangaroo along their way, only for the marsupial to run away with Louis's red jacket with the money in it. While that premise sounds ridiculous on its own, the movie itself has a whole other load of problems. Even though one would imagine the feature put a huge emphasis on the kangaroo that snatched away mafia money, the focus is instead given to Charlie and Louis, who are both horrendously irritating as leads, not helped by Jerry O'Connell and Anthony Anderson's obnoxious overacting. Based on what the film was supposed to be initially, the biggest sin Kangaroo Jack has ever committed is false marketing. Not only does the kangaroo barely appear in the movie as a whole, but its lack of screentime means less comical fun time for a younger audience and more shocking innuendos than expected.As a result of the emphasis being on the general narrative, which is fairly predictable in its own right, the comedy is another rotten stain on the feature's core. Despite the studio editing out a lot of heavily mature content for the final cut, there's still a lot of disgusting college dorm room banter, bathroom talk, juvenile antics and even inappropriate gropes that make one wonder how any family audience could sit through a film like this. Given that this was a Jerry Bruckheimer production, the expectation of a more mature comedy film would be more fitting, but alas, rapping kangaroos took away the appeal. Not to mention, actors like Christopher Walken, Michael Shannon and Marton Csokas play their roles in such a serious tone that the family movie market feels completely out of place already. Also, Estella Warren is just there as a bland hot trope for Charlie to fall for that happens to be part of an Outback Wildlife Foundation. Thanks to its false advertising and insipid humor, what we have are a cast of characters neither interesting nor tolerable enough to warrant any admiration.If there's any credit to give Kangaroo Jack, at least the occasional CG animation of Jack himself is really well done, helped especially by an out of nowhere mirage sequence playing Rapper's Delight that was used to heavily market the feature. Despite at times feeling out of place in the otherwise well shot landscapes of outer Australia, the VFX crew behind the red sweatered kangaroo did a nice job giving life to a character that otherwise shouldn't have been the focus of the movie. Also, the soundtrack itself is a nice addition to a horrendously unfunny movie that is in desperate need of musical appeal. Sadly, that's where the positives end, as even those fun songs every now and then aren't enough to make up for the film's sporadic editing that either feels too rushed for its own good or too slow to make use of traveling transitions (with obvious stock footage too). Based on that factor alone, it feels like the filmmakers had no choice but to rush the theatrical version out as fast as possible, which is a shame considering what might've been an at least more understandable premise than what the public got.It's really sad that the end result of Kangaroo Jack became what it is now, because had Bruckheimer Films just been honest about what it was meant to be, perhaps it wouldn't have been regarded as such a low point in the company's logline. Instead, what we have is a terrible crime caper that pretends to feature a barely existent title character, induces more groans than giggles, features blandly unsympathetic leads and only the occasional charming effect here and there. Unless you enjoy watching movies sardonically, it's best to skip this flick and keep it away from children at all costs. The last thing our generation needs today is to be tricked into seeing a rapping kangaroo comedy anyway.",

            "content": "Kangaroo Jack seriously has me torn. Torn between my childhood love for the film and my current thoughts on it. Years ago, this was one of my favorite films. I watched it various times, and for some reason, couldn't get enough of it. This was also the first film that spawned my love for Anthony Anderson. He sort of reminded me of a new age Chris Farley character. He had no limits, and he was always lovable in his presentation.My thoughts on the film has slightly changed since my last viewing, roughly three years ago. My view on the film didn't change as much as when I rewatched Hey Arnold!: The Movie having not seen it in x amount of years, but it didn't stay the same like it did when I rewatched Good Burger.Still, it's difficult to hate a film so lively and amusing. It revolves around Jerry O'Connell's Charlie, a hair stylist barely making end's meet at his current salon and Anthony Anderson's Louis as his slow-witted, dopey accomplice. After a deal gone completely wrong, Charlie's stepfather Salvatore Maggio (Walken) tells both of them to take a plane to Australia and deliver a confidential package to a man named \"Mr. Smith\" in the Australian Outback.Even after being told not to open the package, Louis opens it to reveal over $50,000 in Benjamin Franklins. Upon arrival to Australia, by accident, Charlie runs over a kangaroo and believes to have killed it. Louis gets the bright idea to put his red Brooklyn jacket, with the money, on the kangaroo after recognizing the beast as \"Jackie Legs.\" The kangaroo turns out to be alive and hops away with the jacket and the money, leaving both Charlie and Louis hopeless, desperate, and pessimistic of the consequences if Sal finds out.I recently mentioned in my review of Three Amigos that the fish out of water premise rarely works. Here, it doesn't break a whole lot of new ground, yet it doesn't make a game out of humiliating the outsiders like many other films of the genre do. Also, the Outback scenery is fantastic with the rusty colored sand and the heat of the desert is captured with pure realism. This is the case where a kid's movie goes a bit beyond expectations.Yet, it goes below expectations with some of the kiddy jokes. Case and point, the camel scene. Unnecessary and not funny. It furthers my thoughts that Hollywood, sometimes, compiles the lowest common denominator of childish entertainment and throws the scattered, messy bag into a film.The film redeems itself by offering characters we'd probably like if they were realistic, and brings above average backstory to its plot. I don't think I've seen a kid's film recently that had as much story focus on the character's lives since Kangaroo Jack.Now comes the inevitable kangaroo, which is the least impressive thing in the film. The kangaroo is odd, and even stranger when he speaks. His lips move in a very odd manner, and his movements are very unnatural. When he jumps, due to the sketchy technology at the time (also present in Ang Lee's Hulk, released the same year) the sound seems to break as if a strong, abrupt wind is blowing by. It's odd, but doesn't happen often. I think the most haunting scene involving the marsupials is when Charlie has a hallucination with several characters voicing several other kangaroos. Even at the end when Jackie Legs says goodbye it comes off as unappealing, and we're glad to be rid of such a peculiar character.Director David McNally also tries to pay homage to the film many of us refer to as \"wet, young, voluptuous women bar dance on a table for about an hour and a half. Of course I'm talking about Coyote Ugly, one of his earlier works. The scene involves Estella Warren showering under a waterfall. The scene is very tame and is likely to go unnoticed. It's no worse than the subtleties in shows like Rugrats or Spongebob Squarepants.Kangaroo Jack has a heart, but sometimes it gets too rambunctious with its immaturity. Its strange protagonist doesn't help matters, but its sufficient plot, steady characters, and fantastic scenery do. It's a cheery, entertaining film. Sometimes, that's good enough for the kids. But maybe not so much for the adults.Starring: Jerry O'Connell, Anthony Anderson, Estella Warren, Christopher Walken, and Michael Shannon. Directed by: David McNally.",

I mean no, it's not a perfect film, nowhere near! The running time isn't as long as it could've been, the story doesn't make much sense ( why does this mafia guy want to kill his stepson because he made one simple mistake? ) the only reason I can think of is that the makers of the film when with the typical stereotypical portrayal of mafia bosses in movies that they kill people for fun and Charlie is just the latest in a long line of whacked people.The CGI does look a bit like it was done by someone Warner Bros hired from the yellow pages rather than the usual professional people they like to use.And the biggest star in the film had such a limited role you'd be forgiven for thinking that this was one of his first ever parts in film!But that doesn't matter! If you were aged between 5-13 when you first saw this film you were guaranteed to enjoy it! Because you're a dumb kid that doesn't know what a good movie looks like yet and you don't have standards for entertainment!! Basically if it has a talking animal that loses the ability to function after eating an atomic gumball, you're going to die laughing! And that's why this film is always going to be one of my favourites!!Maybe that's why the critics didn't like it, because they're all so old and bitter and up their own backsides and that they've lost all that, for lack of a better word \"kidness\" they were incapable of seeing this film through the eyes of an innocent little kid who doesn't care about all those \"important qualities\" a film is supposed to have.\nI'm always going to love this film and will probably keep coming back to watch it every year until I die because it reminds me of a time that I wish more than anything in the entire world that I could go back to!Anyway that's the end of my review, this is my first review by the way, so I hope you find it helpful and informative and I can't wait to write my next one!Enjoy the film and enjoy my review of the next film we watch too! \ud83d\ude09",

Other than that, there's really nothing left to comment on in this chase comedy about a kangaroo that's holding fifty thousand dollars worth of mob money in the Australian outback. It's not bad, necessarily (the kids will love it and the digital effects as far as the kangaroo is concerned are okay), but it's not good either: everything wallows in mediocrity, from the unfunny script (by Steve Bing and Scott Rosenberg, one of the writers of `High Fidelity') that can't even provide decent scatological humor to David NcNally's faceless direction to the blank performances by leads Jerry O'Connell, Anthony Anderson and Estella Warren. Even the chase scenes drone on and on. About the only things of interest are wondering how low Christopher Walken can go for a paycheck and marveling at Dyan Cannon's remarkable sixty-five year old body (even though she's only in the movie about fifteen seconds).",

Also, Jerry O'Connell and Anthony Anderson are a VERY funny comedy team with superb comic timing. I went into this film expecting to hate it, and now I would actually pay to see another film that paired these two (The kangaroo is actually not an important element in the film, certainly not as much as the trailer implies). Of course, this is NOT recommended for people who do not find Bowery Boys or Police Academy films funny, but I do, and I feel that the filmmakers successfully achieved what they set out to do with this film.

But I was scrolling through netflix and it popped up as top 10 so I figured hey why not.While I did see that the movie was box office success. Ratings wise it did extremely poorly across the board. I blame this solely on few things. First the marketing team promoting Kangaroo Jack portrayed him almost as like a Scooby Doo type character when in reality hes in maybe a total of 20 minutes of the movie. Also outside of a 2 minute dream sequence he had no talking lines. Second I have no idea how this movie snuck a PG rating on it. It most definitely isn't kid friendly film. Cursing, violence, romance, crude jokes, sex humor just doesn't fit into PG mold would've done fine as PG-13 rated movie. I believe these two reasons were why movie got panned heavily.With all that said I personally loved the movie even though I see there point of view. Its laugh out loud funny, the chemistry between O'connell and Anderson is great, the pacing is pretty good, and I did enjoy the little twists of action sequences. The movie also ages pretty well too and the visuals in my opinion still hold up today. Def recommend this movie to young adults to adults but would advise against kids viewing.",

The human actors are simply not very good, their characters are bland while Estella Warren can't act and Jerry O'Connell is annoying. The writing throughout is very weak, with the humour either too childish for adults or going over children's heads.

Her character sucked the life out of this, and it almost felt like she was taking Anthony's place. Her character wasn't funny, interesting, and didn't have much of a personality. Conner and her didn't have any chemistry, and couldn't figure out why he even liked her so much, other than her looks. She was very bland, which in turn made the movie bland.Michael Shannon gives a good performance.. You would have thought he was going for the Oscar.

There was foul language, a bar scene where the main character is drinking beers and excited about how much another character can consume, a scene in an airplane where the 2 main characters are handling the ill gotten money in a bathroom and the people outside the toilet are made to believe they are playing with one of the characters feces, there is a scene where the mob boss threatens the lives of the main characters, and a scene where a man they are to deliver the money to also threatens their lives.  All of this is just in the first 30 minutes or so, and after watching just that I read some other reviews on here that went on to discuss worse such as a wet t-shirt contest.  I should have checked out family.org before I tried this movie out, I can only imagine what they have to say about it. Bottom line, this movie has gotten to be #26 of the bottom 100 movies on this site because it's pure trash.

Its one of those movies in which its stupid, but so stupid its decent. The story starts out slow in which we see our main characters meet one another for the first time. It turns out that they become life long buddies. As adventure soon meets them, they find themselves on a journey to Australia to deliver a package to a old friend of the step-father of Charlie played by Jerry O'Connell. The step-father is played by Christopher Walken, and Charlies lifetime friend Louis is played by Anthony Anderson. As the two venture through Australia, they run into a kangaroo and fear that they have killed it. Louis then gets the idea to dress up the kangaroo to make him look like Jackie Legs. But as it turns out the kangaroo is not dead at all and takes off with Louis' jacket containing the package. And so the plot begins, it starts off somewhat slow but does pick up. It has elements of slapstick and snappy one liners that add to this film's atmosphere. This movie isn't horrible but then again its not amazing. Its more for the kids, and reaches a very limited audience. This movie also slows down after a while and then winds back up and then winds back down. I recommend renting it. Overall this movie in my opinion is still underrated as it would appeal more to children than older audiences. Still this movie is decent. I'm gonna rate this movie with an 80% because of its wild cast and small bits of slapstick.",

I went to see it anyway and to my surprise, it made me feel like a kid again.  Real fun ride!  With some surprisingly good moral values thrown in.  I loved Jerry and Anthony's best friend chemistry.  This production has made up for Jerry Bruckheimer's crap fests of the last few years.  The only part I still can't stand is of course, the Kangaroo.  It was cute during it's first scene, then it just got old real fast.  And the marketing for this film is for some reason playing only off the kangaroo.

Doesn't matter. Anyway, he would've been a goner had another boy, Louis Booker, miraculously saved him. The two have been inseparable ever since. In the present, Charlie (Jerry O'Connell) is a hairstylist still suffering under Maggio's reign, and Louis (Anthony Anderson) is the one who usually coaxes Charlie into doing risky yet pointless schemes. When one said scheme results in a major loss for Sal, he decides to send the two bumbling men off to deliver 50 grand to a \"Mr. Smith\" in Australia. After they arrive, their trip quickly goes haywire after they run over a kangaroo. And Louis makes the mistake of putting his \"lucky jacket\", where he kept the money, on the presumably dead 'roo, which then comes alive and runs off with the cash. Now, in order to save themselves, Charlie and Louis must go on a madcap journey through the Outback, teaming with a beautiful animal expert (Estella Warren), while staying one step ahead of Frankie (Michael Shannon), who is trailing them after Sal finds out about their screw-up.This movie is very infamous in many ways. People mainly know it, though, as the movie which was heavily marketed as a talking-animal movie, when it was really anything but. That isn't the worst of it, however. The plot gets downhill with each minute, the stars here can't act their way out of a hostage situation if they tried, and that mirage sequence with the talking Kangaroo Jack, the scene that was played in EVERY.

This has been done in 'Crocodile' Dundee with success and Steve Irwin certainly gets away with it. Besides, I enjoy seeing these warped misguided perceptions of my beloved country. Why take it so seriously?Geeze, not to mention this is about a Kangaroo that outsmarts two New Yorkers. There's nothing to be taken seriously anyway. So pop Kangaroo Jack into the machine and sit back. It's really fun, very funny and above all.... ridiculous. Sometimes we need an escape from the harsh reality of real life.

This film is NOT about a talking roo as the teasers I saw stated. The only time the kangaroo talks is in a dream sequence. Luckily he appears at the end complaining why he wasn't in the movie. So basically the ending is Jack explaining that this movie sucks. There are some funny points in the movie such as the main characters discovering the money in a airplane toilet and everyone mistaking their comments for toilet humour and the ending with Jack. This movie isn't for any type of age. It's not for children due to the objectionable content and it's not for teens or adults because they will not find any of the jokes that were initially intended for the younger audience to be funny at all. This sad excuse for a movie get NOTHING! Okay, a few points for the kangaroo itself. What is this I see, fart jokes that drag on long after be being considered unfunny?

What is even worse is that the film isn't about the kangaroo. He is secondary to an idiot plot. Two best friends who have known each other since boyhood unite when one saves the other from drowning. Too bad that one couldn't save the other from a plot this moronic. They are assigned to transport mob money to Australia and they lose it in a jacket that is worn by a kangaroo. One idiotic situation follows another with lousy directing by David McNally. This would seem an odd followup to his Coyote Ugly but then again, that film sucked crap too. Jerry O'Connell and Anthony Anderson are capable of being funny given the right material, but here they are just plain annoying. Estella Warren as the wildlife researcher serves only as O'Connell's love interest. What's even worse is that she never convinces us that she knows her ass let alone anything about being a wildlife researcher. Christopher Walken is a fine actor who is wasted as a mob boss. Michael Shannon plays one of the moron villains out to do Walken's bidding, which unfortunately doesn't involve leaving the film. The animated kangaroo is fine but the film should be buried in the Australian outback. Score: 1 / 10",

The plot does make sense (sorta) compared to other bad films. The two main characters are friends after one is saved by the other from drowning. They then get into trouble and end up needing to deliver a package to Mr. Smith in Australia for Christopher Walken and Michael Shannon, who are the best things in the film. I mean SERIOUSLY. Their performances make me think they were told that the film is called \"Death in the Outback\" or something of the like. They find out that the package has 50,000 dollars in it, so they go into the airplane bathroom to talk about it loudly without saying any word that means money, so everyone hearing this thinks it's poop they are talking about and that they \"Want to roll in it.\" I can see why people thought it wouldn't be funny for adults. So in Australia they just drive around and hit a kangaroo with their car and because they are sick people the take pictures with it, even putting the one guys' jacket on the kangaroo with the money in it, and then it wakes up, kicks one of the guys and runs off with the cash. The rest of the movie is about them chasing the kangaroo to get the cash back. They then go to a zoologist or someone like that who is Estella Warren and they think she's hot, and they get stranded in the desert a few minutes later and she comes to save them and one of them thinks she's a mirage so he squeezes her tits on camera. WHAT A TOTALLY CHILD APPROPRIATE SCENE! Seriously, I'm OK with a hidden dirty joke in kids films for the adults in the audience, but upright squeezing a womans breasts should NOT BE IN A KIDS MOVIE. Anyway, she then hits him upside the head with a conga drum, knocking him unconscious. He then dreams that the Kangaroo is rapping Hip Hop while, uhm, twerking. Why did the show this scene right after the man squeezed a girl's boobs? No, seriously, why? Also, they used this scene in the trailers, making everyone think the film is about a rapping kangaroo, which, in fact, he's only in the film for like, what, five minutes in total, and a good two minutes is about his finding Licorice and cinnamon candy in the jacket. HE DOESN'T EVEN TALK EXCEPT FOR THE DREAM SEQUENCE OR DURING THE CREDITS! Anyway, then the scene get weirder with two more kangaroos, one of them voiced by Christopher Walken (I think), and it rains money and I at first thought my snacks were laced with LSD. They then close in on the camera chanting \"Chicken Blood.\" Because that's not gonna traumatize kids at all. He wakes up, and for some reason the girl doesn't care about the titty squeezing and is immediate friends and makes out with him later in the film? Sure, that's realistic. So they hunt the kangaroo armed with tranquilizers but then Mr. Smith notifies Walken about not getting the money and Walken sends Shannon to deal with it. I assume. Shannon pretty much just showed up out of the blue in my perspective. Anyway, the following will contain spoilers, but I don't think anyone should really watch this. Unless you want to, then don't read this next part, just skip to were it says: (SPOILER OVER) on my review. Eventually they get the money after chasing the kangaroo, but the PLOT TWIST! Shannon pulls a gun on them and explains in one of the best gangster ways that the money was just being sent to Smith so he could KILL THEM! Seriously, ten bucks says he wasn't aware what the title was. But the police arrive before he can shoot (big disappointment, I know), and that's basically about it. Oh wait, the movie addresses during the credits that they forgot the film was about the kangaroo, with the kangaroo saying: \"Wait a minute, this film is called 'Kangaroo Jack!' It should be about ME!\" (SPOILER OVER) I honestly wish they stuck with the original idea, sure, it may not have been funny, but at least we could see more Walken and Shannon or get some action, and a good story maybe. The only redeeming quality is Walken and Shannon playing a gangsters. They should to a role like that again. But instead we got this garbage which for some reason is considered \"Child Appropriate.\" Sure, nothing like a film about Kangaroos stealing money from gangsters including scenes of titty squeezes and threats at gunpoint for kids! Also the main characters acting in many scenes seems stale and that they forgot their lines and are improvising. Walken and Shannon are the only really good actors in this film, and Warren also did a good job as well, and I hope these three fired their agents after this. But you know what's worse, they made an ANIMATED SEQUEL! It apparently was a success, making $88,929,111 world wide! My guess on that was the misleading trailers and poster, making you think the kangaroo actually talked. It should have been at least a PG-13 with it's violence, sexual content, and language.",

After a string of events, one of the friends' jacket finds it way on the titular character, a kangaroo, with the $50K in the pocket.  The rest of the film is the 2 leads chasing the kangaroo and they in turn being pursued by the thug waiting for the money and Christopher Walken's son and henchmen.Of course, there is a moral and life lesson as the friends learn to appreciate one another and that they one can't do without the other.

The film is basically about a kangaroo that steals $50,000 and the the three of them must get it back. The film is fantastic and is one of the best family pictures around at the minute i personally would give the film **** out of ***** this is a great film and is a great family film from the award winning producer Jerry Bruckheimer.",

            "content": "From director David McNully (Coyote Ugly), I knew it had a kangaroo in it, but I didn't know much else, least of all the stars or plot, so I thought, why not? Basically Charlie Carbone (Scream 2's Jerry O'Connell) has been best friends with Louis Booker (Scary Movie 3 and 4's Razzie nominated Anthony Anderson) since he saved his life when they were kids, and they are involved with mob family leader Salvatore 'Sal' Maggio (Razzie nominated Christopher Walken). After failing to deliver stolen televisions to a warehouse, Sal is giving them one more chance to show they can deliver, by sending them to Australia to deliver an envelope, not to be opened. Of course they do open it, and it is $50,000, to be delivered to a Mr. Smith (Marton Csokas). Unfortunately on the way, they hit a kangaroo, and Louis puts his \"lucky\" jacket on it, not realising it was going to come to life, and forgetting the envelope of money in the pocket. So they are now chasing a red jacket wearing kangaroo, which by the way they gave the name Jack, with some help from Charlie's new love interest, Jessie (Planet of the Apes remake actress Estella Warren). Meanwhile, Mr. Smith himself knows about the \"delay\", thinking they want the money for themselves (which they kind of do), and if now after the two guys, and in the end, when they do eventually get the envelope back from the kangaroo, it turns out they were paying for their own execution. Also starring Dyan Cannon as Anna Carbone, Michael Shannon as Frankie 'The Vermin' Lombardo, Bill Hunter as Blue and David Ngoombujarra as Sr. Sgt. 'Mr. Jimmy' Inkamala. There are bits that really made me laugh, e.g. sounding like talking about poo while in plane toilet, O'Connell and Anderson make a good buddy duo, the chase sequences are quite fun to watch, and the kangaroo (with some CGI help) makes quite a good supporting character. Walken is underused and wasting his time, and I can't call it a fantastic comedy, but it is good family fun. Okay!",

On the way there, they wack Jacky Legs while singing \"Land Down Under\" like a stereotypical American touring Australia would. (G'day Mate!). Lewis puts his \"Lucky Jacket\" on the -dead- roo and oddly the money they were supposed to deliver is in the pocket. Kangaroo gets up bounces off and they're off on a chase to get everything back. At the local pub they meet HOTTIE Estella Warren, who plays Jessi. The outrageously hot wildlife babe who just so happens to be visiting Autralia to mate near-extinct Bilbys. she also happens to have a powerful tranquilizer used for capping roos and they hire a pilot to go hunt him down.

So its a kid's movie. But rated PG cause of suggestive language and/or violence. whee. its a kids movie through and through. Thankfully the kangaroo does NOT talk like seen in the previews, but unfortunately it does feature a 30second little \"Look at me! I'm A CG Kangaroo\" encore sequence.",

I was expecting a fun movie for 12 year olds, heavy on the scatological humor, light on the brains.  While some reviewers will say this is exactly what you get with Kangaroo Jack, we were pleasantly surprised by this film.There is quite a bit of silliness in this movie, and truthfully there are indeed some \"poot\" jokes.  On the other hand, you could tell that the writers actually gave a darn when they were writing this movie.  They trust the viewer enough to set something up early on and let it pan out later.Further, there is a lot of humor in the movie that is above the waistline as well.  On a reluctant trip to Australia to deliver Mob Money that they think might save their lives, two best friends accidentally hit and presumably kill a Kangaroo with their rented Jeep.  Louis, the joker of the two, decides it would make a hilarious picture to dress up the 'Roo in a Brooklyn Jacket and Sunglasses.  Fortunately the 'Roo is alive and hops away. Unfortunately he takes the Jacket with all the Mob Money still in it with him.The remainder of the movie is a hilarious romp across the outback with the two buddies tripping from scene to scene attempting to get their money, and (they believe) their lives back from Kangaroo \"Jackie Legs!\"There are a few twists and turns, some predictable... others, less so, and more than a few \"you've got to be kidding\" moments.  But it's all in good fun!Jerry O'Connell is better than usual as the protagonist.  He manages to gain the viewer's sympathy early on, and doesn't resort to such idiotic conventions as in Tomcats.  Anthony Anderson is likewise hilarious as O'Connell's best buddy.  This guy is a great physical comedian, and never seems embarrassed about his weight.  Together they seem a lot like they're on one of the Road pictures featuring Crosby and Hope.  No, they're not as great as Crosby and Hope, but they do pretty well!  Estella Warren is lovely as ever and is given a little more to do in this movie than is common for her.  Walken plays the same typical Mafioso clown we've seen in a hundred movies with and without Walken in them.  He plays a stock character, and plays him as such.  His misuse of the English Language and vain attempts to improve upon this obvious misuse does crate a smile or two.\nEssentially this is a truly fun movie.  By no means is this a contender for nine Oscars, nor will it be on any Critic's top ten list... but, seriously, was that the plan?  This movie sets out early on to be a fun ride, and it really delivers.  Everyone in the Theatre seemed to be having the fun that was promised in the movie, and at the same time, never did the movie talk down to the viewer.It may not be Citizen Kane, but if you're looking for a fun ride with more than a few laughs, give this film a chance.  It just might surprise you!",

Kangaroo Jack has the most forced plot I have ever seen in a movie.  A major rewrite would be needed to make this film better.  Here's my idea: Start off the movie with Christpher Walken and Marton Csokas in Australia, arranging a hit.  Before Walken can pay Csokas, a kangaroo hops by and the money is dropped accidently into her pouch.  Walken and Csokas chase after the kangaroo into the Outback in turn madcap fashion. Enter:  Jerry O'Connell and Anthony Anderson, two college drop-outs who are trying to hike through Australia but are instead stranded.  They befriend the kangaroo and find the money -- and become targets of W & C. As the plot advances, Jerry and Anthony learn the money in the pouch is suppose to pay Csokas who has been hired to take out Estella Warren, a ranger who is trying to expose Walken as an animal smuggler. Csokas and Walken are stopped in the most humiliating fashion.  Jerry and Anthony find their true calling as rangers at an Australia park and Jerry finds true love with Estella.  The kangaroo hops off into the sunset.

This movie feels like it's having an identity crisis where it's not entirely sure what message it wants to send, what genre it wants to fit, what audience it wants to target, and where it even wants to end up.The leads are slightly entertaining, albeit not very funny. They seem like they're trying to put in a bit of effort into the movie, which is welcomed gratefully, but the biggest problem here is the screenplay. The screenplay is just hackneyed, clich\u00e9d, predictable, and extremely stale. The whole idea behind the picture isn't all that creative, but it did have a bit of potential, I thought, had they been able to realize what they were writing wasn't really all that funny. This is one of those films that I can't blame the actors for. They were capable and had enough chemistry that they could have pulled off a decent comedy. The problem was that the director had no idea if he wanted to do a kiddy film or a comedy or a Rush Hour knock off or a crime thriller...As a family film, Kangaroo utterly fails. There's nothing here that I think kids under the age of eleven would find enjoyable, and anyone over that age would be a little too sophisticated for the jokes in this romp.But even if the film had aimed more for adults rather than kids, I still don't think the filmmakers would have been able to pull it off. Bottom line, the jokes are too adolescent, unless they're being crude, and the dramatic parts are far too silly.3/10",

Worse, (sigh), it's unfunny and desperately overacted, with forced humor(several scenes end with grating bouts of seemingly unending laughter). Everyone either...um...acts like they're anxious to be somewhere else (Christopher Walken's performance-woefully underused-he CAN be funny) or they're constantly struggling to actually get some depth and purpose to their characters.The Australian actors all appeared to be grimly determined to see this through but were obviously not happy. Jerry O'Connell-an apparent cum laude graduate of the Steve Guttenberg School of Ham Acting, could have made more of an impact if he hadn't indulged in so many astonished looks of admiration and reckless \"fighting\" grins. Estella Warren was a nice piece of eye candy, and as another reviewer stated, didn't really have much to do, but her token resistance to O'Connell in the gratuitious bathing scene was just too much. Laura Cox would have far more plausible in the role and seemed just as attractive-plus she's Australian. The Black Sidekick-Anthony Anderson (never heard of him) was just...embarassing.\nSpecial effects/animation-the primary reason I attend kid's movies-were both excellent and dated. The \"Roo's\" were very well done, but the landscapes were screamingly obvious. Rotoscoping has it's place, but viewers are far too used to CGI, now.Whoever wrote this film could also use a few Australian geography lessons.

All bad excuse for family entertainment.KANGAROO JACK is just about as bad as the most popular film of the similar kind, WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT, is great. Like any slapstick family movie, KANGAROO JACK is purely juvenile attempt, only this time, it's produced by Jerry Bruckheimer. Instead of pies thrown at people's faces, baddies stepping on banana splits and then slipping or getting their heads or crotches hit very often (or at least besides them), We have Jerry O'Connell and Anthony Anderson play best buddies who are sent by mob boss Christopher Walken (!) to Australia to deliver $50,000 to a certain Mr. Smith on a specific deadline. Just before parents are starting to think it's the wrong movie, they come across a pesky kangaroo and somehow gets his hands (paws? pouch?) on the $50,000. Now they just throw in explosions, car chases, PG-level slapsticks and maybe a few cuss words in place of the banana splits, pies and silly family movie-level slapsticks.Kids will love it as usual, but there's nothing really likable about it. Adults will either check their watches or cover their ears as and eyes as the movie seems to mistake itself as a BAD BOYS sequel. It's one of the noisiest family picture in years, and also one of the least appealing. Kids will probably root for the kangaroo and his strange antics. But not so surprisingly, adults might as well root for ol' Jack too. At least he seems to be on the right place. The rest of the movie however, from the misguided casting of simply misguided characters to the totally gratuitous action scenes, KANGAROO JACK is a cross between a Jerry Bruckheimer production and a worn-out slapstick comedy that doesn't work either way you look at it. Avoid.Rating: *1/2 out of 5.",

            "content": "** out of ****There are a lot of things wrong with Kangaroo Jack, the first and most obvious being that it shouldn't be billed as a kid's flick, since this movie is a bit too violent and sleazy for that. But casting that general problem aside (which didn't really bother me, but will certainly bother parents), I actually had a pretty good time watching the silly mis-adventures of two lifelong friends in the Australian Outback.Charlie Carbone (Jerry O'Connell) is a New York hairstylist whose best friend, Louis Booker (Anthony Anderson), is a virtual magnet of catastrophe. When Louis' latest \"job\" screws up Charlie's stepfather's (Christopher Walken) \"business,\" they're ordered to send $50,000 in cash to a man in the Outback. But when a supposedly dead kangaroo makes off with the money, Charlie and Louis must enlist the help of Jessie (Estella Warren), an American Outbacker.Kangaroo Jack would probably be more enjoyable fare if you went into it not expecting a kid's flick, but something a little more PG-13ish. There's a surprising amount of violence and a very gratuitously sleazy scene where Estella Warren bathes in an oasis wearing a tight shirt. I'll admit it, she's hot and I relished that scene.  For that brief moment, I sincerely wished this was an R-rated production and she'd take her shirt off.\nAs for Warren herself, it's obvious she's only in the movie based on her good looks because she doesn't have much acting talent and the fact that the one person the Charlie and Louis befriend is American might even be a little insulting considering the wide variety of interesting people that live in Australia.But for the most part, I actually had a pretty good time with this movie, enough that it's an easy video recommendation. The film moves fast, is sometimes very funny, and boasts great chemistry between the two leads, O'Connell and Anderson, which proves to be the anchor that holds the movie together, that and Warren's pleasing looks and the natural beauty of the Australian landscape.O'Connell also has strong chemistry with Warren, enough that more screen time and attention to their burgeoning romance would have been appreciated. Anthony Anderson's presece is effective, but it's also distracting when he suddenly barges in on whatever moment O'Connell and Warren have alone.I could delve more into the silliness of the basic premise, but I won't. Several strong laughs, good chemistry among the leads, and an easy pace keep this one afloat. The ending's pretty lame, but not unexpectedly. Almost a ** 1/2, but that farting scene and lack of focus on O'Connell and Warren keep in strictly it in the \"so-so but entirely watchable\" guilty pleasure category.",

Things quickly go pear-shaped when the money is swiped by a wild kangaroo and the duo give chase...\nThe king of 'Bigger, Faster, Louder' filmmaking, Jerry Bruckheimer, now presents the family version. And depressingly, it's even more lightweight than usual, combining adult humour, childish slapstick and - ironically - merely adequate action into an uneven mix.Director McNally consistently panders to his producer's stylistic whims, the flashy shots out of place with the 'wacky' content. And, bafflingly for a movie whose selling point is a sassy CG marsupial, the kangaroo registers as a stingy cameo, favouring the bad-guys-in-pursuit angle.O'Connell and Anderson gamely attempt a Laurel And Hardy vibe, but are thwarted by a woeful script that has them shrieking, falling over and working laboured gags. Warren's heroine adds little, while Walken's stock turn as mobster Sal finds him slumming yet again. But, unlike the titular 'roo, at least he actually manages to take the money and run.",

The two are sent to Australia to deliver a package containing $50,000.00 to a man named Smith, which as it turns out, is his fee for killing Charlie and Louis, but they manage to lose the money when the jacket in which the money was stashed ends up on a kangaroo that takes off with it.

I ignored it at the cinema, partly due to Jerry O'Connell's admission on Australian TV that we would all hate it (which actually made me LIKE him for the first time ever), and partly because I realise Americans have a particularly warped view of life in \"the sphincter of the universe\".I expected to hate it. I didn't. But that's not to say I LIKED it.While I didn't find any more than a couple of jokes funny (the mirage sequence was the only time I laughed out loud), I found it enjoyable to marvel at the cultural inaccuracies. The terrible slang. I found tragedy in witnessing Bill Hunter making a complete fool of himself, and recalled the better days of his career, when I quoted a classic line from Muriel's Wedding, \"WAKE UP TO YOURSELF!\" at the top of my voice. I gained comfort from the presence of Anthony Anderson, knowing that no matter how bad this movie got, it could never be worse than Cradle 2 the Grave. I found suspense in watching Christopher Walken, anticipating the inevitable moment when his head would explode, due to the sheer inanity of his dialogue. I hooted with joy that Marton Csokas, a NEW ZEALANDER, could portray a bad American caricature of an Australian hit-man so well. I got that tense, sinking feeling upon realising that Lara Cox (\"Cute Girl on Plane\") wasn't going to be in it for more than one scene. I rubbed my eyes and did one of those comedy double-takes when I first laid eyes on Estella Warren (in Planet of the Apes). And I WET MYSELF WITH GLEE when the bloody thing was OVER!Oh. I didn't even mention the Kangaroo. Best I don't start.So, all in all a cathartic, if not always pleasant, experience. It made me feel good to be Australian.

They then somehow go via Alice springs (which for some reason looks like an old western town). Alice springs is north of coober pedy by about 1200km and if driving from Sydney they are coming from the east. It seems that the writers have just plucked some random names of cities and put them in the story. It isn't a big deal, but seriously, if i want to go to Miami, i don't fly to L.A then drive there via New York...Just saying. Alice springs is also a large town with around 30 000 people. Now that this is cleared up, although the plot wasn't very new or creative, it still made for a good story, even though it was entirely predictable at times. With the exception of Estella Warren, the cast was good. I like Chris Walken's character, albeit a minor role for him.

They aren't supposed to know what's in the package they are delivering but one of them can't resist looking and discovers it is a substantial sum of money (by their standards). Anyway, once in Australia, they hire a four-wheel-drive and head off towards Coober Pedy where they are supposed to deliver the package. They obviously have no idea about the Australian outback (interior) because they don't even take hats - an essential survival item in Aussie. It is also obvious that they have no idea what the 2000 km trip from Sydney to Coober Pedy entails but they set off anyway.Along the way, we are shown a scene of Uluru (Ayers Rock) which is nowhere near the route they are taking but I guess that's just something that most non-Australiand connect with the outback and that's obviously excuse enough to include it! They also end up at Alice Springs (also nowhere near their route - unless they take a very long way around!). However, as a result of various adventures which a mildly humorous, our two American city boys end up wandering lost in the Aussie desert (without hats or water - a great recipe for probably not even lasting a single day - it gets to temperatures of over 50 degrees Celsius in the outback!).The story (and its title) centres around a kangaroo that the guys hit along the way and, thinking they've killed it, put a jacket on it and take photos - except that it isn't dead and suddenly hops off still wearing the jacket - with the package of money in the pocket!Various ridiculous adventures follow including a flight with a drunken bushman, a camel ride with a rather attractive American research biologist and confrontations with the bad guy they were sent to as well as one of the henchmen of the guy who sent them who all seem to have no difficulty finding them in the middle of several hundred thousand square kilometres of desert.Yet again, this is one of those movies that I believe should be classed as a farce (except that IMDb don't have that classification) because it is totally farcical. Not that that is necessarily a bad thing if you like farces. I don't mind them for a light diversion from more serious movies occasionally (which is why I have given it 5) but this one really does leave a lot to be desired!

The film passed by very quickly for me, it had a fun story with good pacing, good location, gorgeous female interest, and a nice short runtime.The Kangaroo has been poorly advertised, he's simply a plot point more than a character, with some impressive CG work.. people expecting a talking animal movie are dissapointed, but someone like me who would prefer less Jar Jar Binks in the world appreciate how the Kangaroo is used..\nmy only real complaint is the way the leads treat the Kangaroo at the start of the film when they think its dead.. honestly is dressing up road kill is something you'd expect from Tom Green, not a kid's movie..but all in all, if you want a fun road movie that is easy on the mind and the eye, you should have a good time with Kangaroo Jack.. as for Dumb & Dumberer, now that's a crap film!

Movies with animals in starring roles are generally terrible or gag-inducing family films, but this one isn't really either. The kangaroo is only in the film for around 5 minutes. It's really just a reasonably decent crime caper comedy/buddy film that for some inexplicable reason has a kangaroo (which doesn't talk by the way except in a dream sequence) as a plot device. All in all a standard Jerry Bruckheimer type production,  except with a stupid title and a kangaroo. Lots of action, lots of humor, snappy dialogue, a hetero love interest for the main character, a dumb plot, and a happy ending. Sure, you've probably seen it all before. But, it's reasonably good for what it is. It's not Citizen Kane but if you want light entertainment, you could do a lot worse. Not really a family film by the way, despite appearances to the contrary. All in all a mediocre film, but not bad by any stretch of the imagination.",

Maybe a mistake, but you really shouldn't judge the movie itself by target audience / trailer / marketing.

The plot was truly original, the scenery was breathtaking, and the characters were unique. Jerry O'Connell and Anthony Anderson remind us a lot of Nickelodeon stars Kenan and Kel. A hilarious scene involving an airplane restroom had a string of double-entendres that could have fit in an \"Austin Powers\" movie.

            "content": "This film without question is among the finest of the last 100 years. Why it has received weak reviews can only be justified by the degrading cultural taste of the American populous. It seems modern western society lacks any ability to recognize and appreciate, true, thought-out, legitimately funny film.It is my sincere belief that this film is ahead of its time. Perhaps when two or three generations have passed, this movie will be hailed as a classic, and is likely the first, of an era-defining dynasty of films. Much like the bible, this will likely be the cornerstone for several religious faiths, sprouting billions of followers for millennia to come.\nThe lovable kangaroo will initially be featured in dozens of movies, each one shattering box-office record held by the previous edition. At first being a mischievous rodent, not only stealing money, but chastity of virgins (both kangaroo and human), and engaging in outrageous schemes such as disguising himself as a man, and winning the American presidential election.\nDuring the peak of the 'Kangaroo Jack' reign, the Academy Awards will be cancelled for decades on end, following the forfeiter of all competition, as it will be well beyond obvious which masterminds the Oscar hardware will belong to.After nearly a century of ruling the movie industry, the population will grow weary and seek a new, more down to earth protagonist, facing real world problems. The innovators behind this brilliant idea will be forced to retool the once wildly popular kangaroo's persona, making him more identifiable to the common viewer.After a short recess in the kangaroo series, a new film, featuring a meeting with a mentor, in a 'good will hunting' fashion, the kangaroo will learn to suppress his malevolent, sadistic tendencies and use his unparalleled but poorly directed raw intellect for the good of humanity. Future films will feature the kangaroo rescuing street children, feeding the hungry, curing cancer, and helping the blind see. Not limited to philanthropy, the kangaroo will prove the baffling problem of the grand unified field theory of physics, and be the first to defy the speed of light, both of which were once thought impossible.This tweak of character will pass shockwaves through our culture, sending sales of 'Kangaroo Jack' religious paraphernalia past the trillion dollar milestone, at this point, the protagonist is beyond god level, and mere mortals seeking to become kangaroos, have themselves surgically altered to pass as these once lowly Australian vermin.Likely, in the final episode of this monolithic series, the kangaroo dies for the sins of humanity in a blasphemous, yet ingeniously tasteful mock-up of the final days of Christ. Betrayed by those he was sent to save, our protagonist dies brokenhearted and forsaken, but reappears as an apparition three days later to his most loyal followers, and promises to one-day return, leaving the door open for a second series.I for one, anticipate the future of this great film, and wish I could live to see the day when this film will receive the acclaim it so deserves.\n-Mike C",

I thought to myself, \"is it any good?\" Many critics said no.I remembered Coyote Ugly, which I saw (and kinda liked) back in 2017 (forget what I said in my review of that movie - I've matured since I was 17). There are many parallels I can draw between both films:Both were produced by Jerry Bruckheimer. They were box office successes but generally poorly received by critics. The soundtracks were overseen by former members of the band Yes (and both of them were called Trevor). Both starred Adam Garcia as an Australian character.Eventually, I decided to give it a chance. (I saw this on 29 December 2020.)It was definitely as awful as they said.There was so much wrong with this: false advertising, stupidity from the main characters, gross-out humour (not done right), choppy editing (mainly a by-product of its past as Down and Under) and \"adult humour\" that's incredibly juvenile. And the less said about Charlie's attitude towards Jessie the better.At the camp, Charlie knocks on a drum near Jessie. She does not react for about five seconds, and even then her reaction is NOT AT ALL convincing.I couldn't even watch the whole thing in one sitting, no thanks to the camel fart scene. I had to pick up where I left off the next day.The ending is just the worst. After all Charlie did to Jessie, they end up MARRIED and living on a yacht. And then the kangaroo shows up in a self-aware scene, stating that the film should have been about him. That's EXACTLY what we were all thinking. At least they got an Australian to voice him.If you do decide to sit through this atrocity, please have some rum to dull the pain.",

Not by a long shot. Hell, it's not even the worst movie centered around a CGI talking animal that I've ever seen. Speaking of which, the movie isn't even about the titular Kangaroo Jack. Instead, it's about a hairdresser named Charlie and his best friend Louis, who saved him from drowning when they were kids. When a job goes awry, Charlie's stepfather, a Mafia don played by Christopher Walken (who's easily the best part of the movie) sends them to Australia with $50,000 in an envelope and the two accidentally hit a kangaroo along the way. They mess around with it until the titular kangaroo comes to life apparently surviving the supposed hit-and-run, and the movie devolves into a wild goose-chase (or in this case, kangaroo chase) they come across clich\u00e9d love interest (seriously, she's only there to be Charlie's love interest) and soon enough mob lieutenant Frankie (played by Michael Shannon, who's way too good for a movie like this) chases after them.You might think I'm skimming a few details, well given its mercifully short runtime (like an hour and 20-something minutes) there isn't much to spoil or go too much into detail. Honestly, it's not really something to get worked up about.Yes, there are scenes that are really cringeworthy (the titular kangaroo rapping, farting camels, Kangaroo Jack doing a Looney Tunes bit at the very end, yeah that happened) but other than that, it's just a waste of time. Apart from a few chase scenes here and there, there isn't much for me to get invested. The comedy sucks and the titular kangaroo isn't even the star of his own movie.Bottom line, this movie isn't even worth paying much attention to or remembering. It's not offensively bad, it's not rage-inducingly bad. It's just forgettably bad.",

There are some genuine comic moments in the film, the chase scenes are good and the dramatic cliff scene at the end kept my kids on the edge of the seats. The plot is nice and tidy and has no loose ends at the end. The story moves along at a nice pace, the relationships between the characters are explained and I was left thinking, what a good kids film for kids 8 and above (Too many men with guns for the littlest ones).The kangaroo has only a little to do with the story. The animated kangaroo jumped very realistically though and thankfully, they didn't make it into a talking kangaroo (except in a dream sequence).All in all, 7 out of 10, way above the average of 4.conan",

            "content": "I don't normally leave reviews on this website but I figured I had to set the record straight on this one: yes, this movie is actually more of a Buddy gangster comedy than the advertising may suggest. Yes, there is a rapping kangaroo in the trailer but he is only in the movie for under five minutes as Anthony Anderson fires six rounds between his googly Australian eyes then dumps his worthless carcass in the Pacific right before the opening credits roll. This is fine because the kangaroo is a wanted criminal who not only stole $20 from the protagonists and subsequently $10 to anyone who willingly saw this in theaters. Jerry Connell shines as \"bewildered white person\" as best as he can but lacks the enthusiasm he did in Sharknado 3DD when he is castrated on-screen by a shark or in Two Headed Shark Attack where the same thing happens. Anthony Anderson does a great job of topping out my speakers every time he \"talks\" in his \"indoor voice.\" Despite all this, this movie does a great job of showing the fun and whimsy behind the scenes of organized crime that most films often gloss over (or in the case of The Godfather, not even bother), and unlike the ransoms demanded for kidnapped relatives in the movie, the laughs do come cheap! Do you want to see Christopher Walken talk in \"Australian?\" Don't watch this movie, because he doesn't do it in this. There are arguably other laughs to be had, just wait until the end and give up if you haven't laughed.",

I have seen the film and it goes like this: Two Brooklyn men: Charlie Carbone and Louis Booker, are tricked by an Italian mob into flying to Australia to deliver a large sum of money ($50000) to a subsidiary of the mob situated in the Outback to pay for their execution. But, when they hit a kangaroo in their Jeep, they decide to dress it up in Louis' red jacket, which has the money in its pocket! The kangaroo hops away with the riches, and Charlie and Louis realize it when it's too late! At a nearby bar, they meet a scruffy man called Blue, and a woman named Jessie who works at a wildlife office. Louis calls the leader of the mob, Sal Maggio, to tell him that all the money is on a kangaroo. You imagine, he's not really happy, and he sends his henchmen to Australia to get the money. (Sal doesn't believe the kangaroo story and thinks Louis and Charlie took the money and used it for themselves!) After that, they go to the wildlife office where Jessie works and asks her for tips on catching the kangaroo and taking the jacket and money off him! Jessie gives them a pack of tranquilizer darts and a rifle to put them in. They are also given the money for a professional airplane pilot, Blue! On the plane with Blue, instead of tranquilizing the kangaroo, who has earned the nickname \"Jackie Legs\", Louis shoots Blue! With the pilot asleep, the plane crashes and everyone is out OK. Leaving Blue by the plane wreck, Louis and Charlie leave to pursue Jackie on foot. When Charlie starts getting delirious, he is rescued by Jessie, who takes care of him. Jessie and Charle fall in love, but Louis intervenes too much! In the end, they find Jackie Legs, take the money and jacket, all the mobsters are arrested, and Charlie marries Jessie, they invent a best-selling shampoo with extracts from Australian plants, become rich, and live together with Louis. Great movie, isn't it?",

When they arrive in Australia, they run over a kangaroo. Instead of going and burying the thing, thus saving me from wasting my time, they put Louis' hoodie on it and take pictures. The kangaroo wakes up and runs, taking the $50,000.Kangaroo Jack is like it sounds: stupid. Not funny stupid. Just stupid. There are almost no jokes in it that are funny. Remember the commercial? The only way you couldn't have known about this movie is if you've been living under a rock for 4 years. Anyway, in the commercial there is a talking kangaroo, right? That's only a dream. The stupid kangaroo doesn't talk!! This movie not only sucks, it advertises falsely! So there you have it. The only thing that saves this movie from a 1 is the ending is pretty decent. There you are.

I had to start playing \"snake\" on my cell phone to keep from scratching my eyeballs out their sockets while watching this predictable, horrible train wreck. I have to wonder how not only did this movie get made and released, but how it is now the top movie at the box offices. The movie seemed to be a decent family movie until they decided to get racy and up it to a PG rating by showing Estella Warren bathing in the river (with a very nice white T-shirt I might add). So it's not a kid's movie, and definitely not an adult movie... What the hell is it?!This my friends, is what is wrong with America, or just the movie industry in general today. When a movie as excruciating as Kangaroo Jack is tops at the box office, perhaps only due to having a popular director's name behind it, something is seriously wrong. Of course I went into the movie knowing it would be horrible, but never did I believe I was about to witness the worst atrocity to hit theaters since... Well I honestly cannot remember seeing anything worse. I pray you people, do not pay your hard-earned money to sit through an hour and a half of a corny, scatterbrained plot that was apparently dreamed under the influence of morphine, scribbled onto a IHOP napkin, and handed to Jerry Bruckheimer to slap his name on it to make a few million dollars.

This is primarily because of folks who haven't seen the movie, that are voting it a 1. Get a life. Before you judge the film as a piece of garbage, at least see it. And it is a children's film, so if the premise is trite or stupid to you, it may be right up a child's alley. A few of my friends took their children to see it, and I haven't heard anything negative. Is the movie junk-food? I'm sure. But it's kids junk food. If you've seen the movie and it's terrible - great. Comment away. You wasted your hard earned $$$$. But, if you're judging the movie primarily on it's plot, please don't vote or comment. The execution makes a movie. Especially a junk-food flick. Not the premise. There are plenty of clunky plots that are entertaining films due to intentionally hammy execution. Oh - and it's grossing fairly well, at the box office, with very little declines.

Jerry O'Connel is not good especially when he is doing anything with the CGI Kangaroo because it feels like he is struggling with the fact he's staring at nothing. Anthony Anderson has a good lively and funny delivery and presence and is the best thing about the film but his character who is not fleshed out and bad jokes hold back his performance constantly. The rest of the cast is just ok and generic. The music is ok at best and forgettable. The cinematography is ok with the scenes with the CGI Kangaroo not fitting the rest of the film and looking cheap. There are also some weird camera angles sometimes that feel out of place. The rest is just ok. The Pacing is actually pretty solid because its such a quick film and moves at a fast pace throughout the whole thing but never really builds tension. The editing is the biggest problem here being not very good at all because outside of the stupid montage transition scenes which don't fit the rest of the picture, the scenes with Jack & the others feel almost like two different films at times. The Plot is also very stupid and just feels like at times this is the script of two different movies put together that don't work. Finally the jokes are not good at all and I only found myself laughing at times because of how bad they were and in the middle I was shocked how many were predictable. Overall this is kind of a mess plot & editing wise and not very good overall. I would say skip this completely it not very good.",

Once in a lifetime you'll come across a film that truly captures the history and cultural distinctions of the modern world the way a person can subjectively perceive it through our guided field of perspective. I have to admit, I had my doubts when I first learned of the movie. After all, Kangaroo jack? Will this script even be good? How ignorant was I to even have these thoughts. Little did I know I was about to indulge in what may have been the best 1 hour and 39 minutes of my life. The movie started out strong. The opening scenes enticed the audience with a captivating enigma. I was so taken aback from the next-generation animation that I almost didn't even realize the underlying symbolism in the ongoing scenes. It wasn't until my twenty sixth viewing of the movie where I finally got my bearings together and was able to focus on the gripping and labyrinthine stratagem. The underlying analogy for 19th century distopianism and the evangelical deviation of typical orthodoxy was enlightening to say the least. Just when I thought the movie could not get any better, the increasing conflict before the climax began. I could not believe the complexity of the story as the main bee protagonist, Me, struggled with the everyday endeavors for a quintessential Roo such as the consistent up- hill altercation of the fight against a jacket stuck on me and the fiscal synergy of opposing interplanetary dynamism with a pocket full of Twizzlers. There I was, gripping to my chair as the conflict of the movie began. I was so enticed by the movie that I felt as if I was both practically and relatively apart of the movie. This is a special kind of high that not even the strongest of drugs can give you. Was I part of the movie? Am I inside the movie right now? This movie will leave you questioning existential nihilism and the objective skepticism of our perceived valuation of anthropological existence. At this point in the film, I was fully intoxicated by the realistic CGI of my glorious persona. That's when the plot finally aggrandized and I was completely stupefied. You could have lived a thousand years of isolation trying to predict the plot twist and you would never even scratch the surface of what actually transpires in the movie. I was so bewildered that I actually had to pause the movie so that my existential crisis didn't dive too deep inside of myself. Even pausing the movie was surreal. It's almost as if life paused with the movie. I felt as though I had actually become a cinematic tangent quantum. The effects are still wearing off and I haven't been able to watch the movie in several years. I spent the following seven years afraid of what outside of my house actually looks like. Every single day and night I live in misery because I became fully aware that happiness is never achievable. I realized that kangaroo life has absolutely no meaning and that no matter what I ever do, it is of complete unimportance and in years from now, no recollection of my existence will prevail, meaning that if I died years ago, died now, or die sometime in the future it will not matter whatsoever to anyone. But, then again, the fact that I'm living doesn't matter either so I might as well stick around for awhile, living in complete isolation, condemned to a life of traumatic memories and a completely corrupted sub-conscience. Kangaroo Jack literally ruined my life. 10/10",

The movie plot isrelatively complex and i would not rate it as a family movie, as any child below the age of 12 lacks any form of wisdom to even understand the movie. However with my astronomically high intellect i can safely assure you this is a piece of art. The plot is about two men from Brooklyn, which immediately makes the movie unique as i have watched many movies in my lifetime and not one of the was set in Brooklyn. These two men have to fulfill a task of delivering $50,000 to a gang in outback Australia. However, a kangaroo accidentally gets away with the money and they have to acquire the money back. I will not spoil the movie as i am a man of morality. However i am proud to say that i have a copy of these on DVD so i would gladly rent it to you (i am not willing to sell as it is one of my prized possessions and i shall give it to one of my children once i have died) I also do not know how this did NOT get an Oscar for best picture as the winner for that year (Lord of the rings: Return of the king) has absolutely nothing noteworthy about it except that it was filmed in new zealand which is a really nice country that id recommend you visit. Back to the topic at hand, a single scene in Kangaroo Jack is better than the entire Lord of the rings trilogy alone. The scene where Louis and Charlie are singing 'Land down under' whilst driving really brought a tear to my eye. All in all, i believe it is a sin to not see this movie and if you dont watch it then i disapprove of your actions all past, present and future. Good day to you.",

Well, too bad because the kangaroo isn't the main character, he only occasionally appears in a pathetic attempt to justify the title, it's mostly two guys chasing him and you know that bit where he raps in the trailer? Sorry but it's a dream sequence that was only meant for the trailer. Instead, you get a mix between an unfunny family comedy and an unfunny crime comedy. Because surely, unintentional sexual harassment is what every 8-year-old wants to see in their movie about a Looney Tunes kangaroo. Yes, this movie is not as family-friendly as the advertising may have led you to believe. While the movie was released at a time when all PG-rated comedies were trying to be edgy in the wake of Shrek's success, the reason why it didn't work here because there's no subtlety. The script casually admits saying crap like \"...make your testicles fall off\" and \"We're having a very intimate, non-gay moment\". While children are going to learn about this stuff eventually, at least don't mention them verbatim. If Disney can write a song about an old man lusting for a much younger woman and wanting to avoid damnation without directly saying \"Sex is evil and I am horny\", then surely you can make some improvements as well, Warner Bros. I'll admit Christopher Walken was the best thing about this movie and I got a laugh in just one scene which for me was basically if the writers of Austin Powers made a kids' movie(?). The humour is terrible, the action is unexciting, the characters are generic, the content is VERY PG-13, the CGI kangaroo is nightmarish and not very convincing even when he's not CGI and this movie also has the most insulting special features I've ever seen. If you go to the bonus features menu on the DVD, everyone behaves as if the kangaroo is a big part of the movie. Must be some slow days for his voice actor. There's even a behind-the-scenes on HOW THEY MADE CAMELS FART!!! It says a lot about the quality of your movie when your crowning achievement in sound design was flatulence. Kangaroo Jack is awful!",

            "content": "\"Australia, the Land Down Under... home to 20 million Kangaroos...\" What a great start to a movie!\n\nThe only problem with the movie Kangaroo Jack is that Kangaroo Jack, a lively marsupial that we were lead to believe was the main character, is not the main character. That's right, in fact, the main characters are Charlie Carbone (Jerry O'Connell) and Louis Booker (Anthony Anderson) from Brooklyn. This movie was not what one might have expected. We were lead to believe it was about Kangaroo Jack, an animated talking marsupial who resides in Australia, however, it spends about half of the movie in Brooklyn fleshing out the character roles of Charlie and Louis. By the way, it doesn't do a great job of that either. \n\nThis movie is a slapstick family comedy that will be a hit for little ones who don't think much about story lines, or lowbrow humor, or having sexual innuendos go over their head.\n\nHere's a quick summary of the movie. It begins with a flashback to introduce the main characters and then flashes forward into the lives of Charlie (Jerry O'Connell) and Louis (Anthony Anderson). Louis has a job he needs help with and some to find out it was delivery stolen TVs. After a police chase scene they end up where Charlie's mob boss step dad was storing stolen goods. This makes Sal (Charlie's step dad) very angry and he send them on a mission to Australia. This was basically just a ton of bland chase scenes and a very strange ending.\n\nFor a family film, this one was pretty violent. It seems that everyone brandishes a gun at some point and it crosses the line a bit with this quote from Mr. Smith where he says, \"I'll chop you into snags and feed you to the crocs.\" Add to that the fact that the only female role is an overly sexy wildlife foundation employee and we end up with not the most family-friendly image.\n\nIn essence, the comedy was nothing above juvenile, the violence was a bit over the top for a family comedy, and, most importantly, Kangaroo Jack only has a handful of parts to play. If you were expecting the lively kangaroo from the trailer to take the show, then this movie will disappoint you. He simply does not play as big of a part in the movie as the trailer led us to believe. \n\nI don't even want to mention the fact that the whole time it felt as if the director's didn't know whether to make the kangaroo as close to natural as possible or to make him the lively talking kangaroo we saw in the trailers. If only the airplane lavatory scene could have saved this film from an onslaught of poor reviews and disappointment. \n\nThis movie is great for audiences with low attention spans and ones who don't care about the plot, or really anything that makes the movie good. As for the rest of us, don't waste your time. You're better off watching Elf which was also released in 2003. It took the comedy aspect of this movie and made it flourish.",

            "content": "''Kangaroo Jack'' concerns a pair of hapless fellows from Brooklyn who set off for Australia with $50,000 of a Mafioso's money, which is promptly snatched by a marsupial, setting in motion all manner of tiresome high jinks. Actually, the hectic, pointless motion of this interracial buddy action kiddie comedy a kind of eager younger brother to the cruder, more violent ''National Security,'' begins well before the kangaroo arrives on the scene. Early on, there is a squealing car chase through someplace supposed to be Brooklyn, during which many pounds of fish and several television sets fall from trucks. Behind the wheel is Louis Booker (Anthony Anderson), a roly-poly black schemer who is always leading his white best friend, Charlie Carbone (Jerry O'Connell), into trouble. Twenty years earlier, according to a flashback, Louis saved Charlie from drowning at Coney Island. Now the two of them have run afoul of Sal Maggio (Christopher Walken), a crime boss who also happens to be Charlie's stepfather. Mr. Walken's presence guarantees the film a future life, as evidence, along with ''The Country Bears'' and ''The Affair of the Necklace,'' that he may be the least discriminating actor in film history.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, for reasons that are neither very important nor very coherently explained, the two pals set off for the Outback, where they meet some funny-talking locals, an American expatriate love interest for Charlie (Estella Warren) and various bad guys, including a few who have followed them from Brooklyn. (Louis, an overweight man with the demeanor of an 8-year-old, has no love interest.) As photographed by Peter Menzies Jr., the Australian desert is as grand and austere in its rust and ocher tones as the American Southwest. What better to do with such a quiet, majestic landscape than to liven it up with the noise and vulgarity of lowest-common-denominator American pop culture? And so, since real kangaroos are not dynamic, or commercial, enough, the actual animals are enhanced by computer imagery, so that one in particular can hop around in a red baseball jacket snatched from Louis. (In a hallucination sequence, and then during the end credits, the beasts even talk, one of them in the voice of the ever-versatile, ever-unembarrassable Mr. Walken.)\r\n\r\nThe details of the theft are worth mentioning, since they give some sense of what this movie thinks its young target audience will find humorous. (''Kangaroo Jack,'' which is rated PG, is being heavily promoted on children's television.) Charlie and Louis run over the kangaroo in their Jeep and, thinking the creature is dead, decide to dress him up in their clothes and take pictures of it (what everyone does with road kill, I guess.) Then he springs to life and bounds away, leaving them to give chase on foot, in a plane and on the backs of camels prone to severe flatulence. The movie, produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and directed by David McNally (who did ''Coyote Ugly'' for Mr. Bruckheimer a few years ago), wants to have it both ways: to be mean and bratty while retaining a wholesome veneer. Thus, Ms. Warren's character is a wildlife conservationist whose breasts are fondled by Mr. O'Connell and repeatedly ogled by the cameras. Thus, many guns are brandished and aimed, but nobody is actually shot. The late revelation that the two friends were being set up for a gangland execution is treated as offhandedly as the bizarrely inappropriate reference to ''Scarface.'' Friendship is reaffirmed, and the dim-witted good guys wind up fabulously rich. \r\n\r\nThis movie is disgusting.",
