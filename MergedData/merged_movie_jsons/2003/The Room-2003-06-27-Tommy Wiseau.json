However, his girlfriend seems not to settle for what she has.I would not have known about this film if not for \"The Disaster Artist\". Seriously, the sets are bad, the lighting is bad, the camera angles are bad, the camera is mostly static, the acting is horrible, and the story is just bad. The plot is so thin that it almost appears to be a soft core film. It is worse than a B film. It is so bad that I laughed out loud several times, such as the infamous bottle throwing scene, or when Jack throws the girlfriend on the sofa, or the fight in the party. And could they have at least filmed on a real rooftop, instead of the fake computer generated scenery? The acting is so bad, most of the characters are wooden, except the mother who has a quite a character. The film is so bad that it becomes good. I do recommend it.",

            "content": "Okay - quality of the movie [0/10]\nEnjoyability of the movie [10/10]Total paradox, right?This is the absolute pinnacle of bad story, bad dialogue, bad editing, bad plot.. I mean, I'm saying 'bad' like there actually is any of these elements within the film. The editing makes no sense, it seems randomly cut with continuity errors, there are lines like 'What's going on with the candles and the music' when there ARE NO candles or music.. The entire thing is absurd. But what makes it truly unique is that it was done entirely seriously, this is not a tongue in cheek production like low budget bad movies that know they are catering to an audience who expect to laugh at the poor effects and story.. No, this man, Tommy Wuseau, honestly, genuinely thought he was crafting his magnum opus, masterpiece of cinema.Is it good? Absolutely, definitely not.However - as a movie EXPERIENCE. I watched this with some of my family, warning them it was terrible, but we had one of the funniest, most incredible bonding experiences in cinematic history - As we collectively picked apart every camera angle, wobbly set, insane use of props, costume, music that skips, repeats, continuity, edits, plot and dialogue. There is not one redeeming moment in the entire movie. Even if there is a single well crafted line (there isn't) it would have to be spoken by either a terrible actor or by Tommy himself, who's accent sounds like it was in a European car crash . We all laughed until it HURT, and for that.. I have to give the experience a 10/10. I've never enjoyed a movie more with friends and family more than this one.. EVER.I head that the experience is similar in theatres that still show this film for precisely this reason. Everybody dresses up as their favourite character, recites every line and throws spoons at the screen every time one inexplicably ends up on screen (it's a lot.. is there a reason behind this 'artistic' decision. No. There is no reason for anything)There is more and more to notice about this film every time I watch it.. Most recently, how the architecture of the building makes no sense whatsoever. They appear to be on the ground floor, but exiting from the other side causes them to end up on the roof - at night. It's things like this that could inspire a PhD in studying the intricate insanity and entirely non sequitur values of every moment in The Room.Do I recommend it? Well.. how can I not. Everyone needs to see this movie at least once, after a couple of drinks and with friends. It's even funnier than Weekend at Bernies after taking magic mushrooms.I almost died laughing from a hypoxic brain injury, unable to catch my breath - narrowly avoiding giggling myself into a coma.The finest abdominal workout video ever made.",

            "content": "I have now seen Mr. Tommy Wiseau's cinematic tour-de-force, 'The Room'  three times. With each viewing, 'The Room' becomes more complexly  entangled in and inseparable from my own life. I no longer know where  The Room ends and I begin.  It is, without question, the worst film ever made. But this comment is in no way meant to be discouraging.  Because while The Room is the worst movie ever made it is also the  greatest way to spend a blisteringly fast 100 minutes in the dark.  Simply put, 'The Room' will change your life.  It's not just the dreadful acting or the sub-normal screenplay or the  bewildering direction or the musical score so soaked in melodrama that  you will throw up on yourself or the lunatic-making cinematography; no,  there is something so magically wrong with this movie that it can only  be the product of divine intervention. If you took the greatest  filmmakers in history and gave them all the task of purposefully  creating a film as spectacularly horrible as this not one of them, with  all their knowledge and skill, could make anything that could even be  considered as a contender. Not one line or scene would rival any moment  in The Room.  The centerpiece of this filmic holocaust is Mr. Tommy Wiseau himself.  Without him, it would still be the worst movie ever made, but with him  it is the greatest worst movie ever made. Tommy has been described as a  Cajun, a Croatian cyborg, possibly from Belgium, clearly a product of  Denmark, or maybe even not from this world or dimension. All of these  things are true at any one moment. He is a tantalizing mystery stuffed  inside an enigma wrapped in bacon and smothered in cheese. You will  fall in love with this man even as you are repelled by him from the  first moment he steps onto screen with his long Louis the Fourteenth  style black locks and thick triangular shoulders packed into an oddly  fitting suit, and his metallic steroid destroyed skin. Tommy looks out  of place, out of time and out of this world. There has never been  anything else like him. Nor will there ever be.  The Room begins with 'Johnny' (Tommy Wiseau) and his incomprehensibly  evil fianc\u00e9e 'Lisa' (played by a woman with incongruously colored  eyebrows and a propensity for removing her shirt) engaging in some  light frottage, joined by, Denny, (played with a deft sense of the  absurd by Phillip Haldiman), their sexually confused teenage neighbor  who is clearly suffering from a form of aged decrepitude. When Denny,  who looks like the human version of Gleek the monkey from Superfriends,  says, in a slightly creepy yet playful tone of voice, 'I like to  watch!' as Johnny and Lisa roll around the bed in a pre-intercourse  ritual revolving around rose petals, you know you are in for a very  special movie.  After a lengthy lovemaking scene (not to worry if you miss it the first  time, they show it again in its entirety later in the movie) in which  Tommy's bizarre scaly torso and over-anatomized rear-end are lovingly  depicted over and over again as he appears to hump Lisa's hip, we  discover that Lisa, for no particular reason, has become bored with  Tommy's incessant lovemaking and decides to leave him.  Just when you think the movie might lapse into an ordinary, pedestrian  sort of badness, Johnny's best friend Mark, a man who's job seems to be  to wear James Brolin's beard from Amityville Horror, shows up and  electrifies the screen with a performance so wooden that it belongs in  the lumber section of Home Depot. Incidentally, Mark is played by Greg  Sestero, who, in addition to being described as a department store  mannequin, was also the line producer on 'The Room' and one of Tommy  Wiseau's five (5!!!!!) assistants on the movie. Lisa forces Mark, amid  his paltry, unconvincing protests, to have an affair with her on their  uncomfortable circular stairs. For no apparent reason Lisa decides that  she is made of pure evil and wants to torture her angelic and insanely  devoted fianc\u00e9, Johnny.  Lisa receives pointed advice from her mother who casually announces  that she is dying of breast cancer and then never mentions it again.  But Lisa is determined to make Johnny's life a living hell, in spite of  the fact that she, according to her mother, \"cannot survive on her own  in the cutthroat 'computer business'\". But not before they recycle the  sex scene from earlier in the movie where we get another bird's eye  view of Johnny's ludicrous naked body. Denny gets into trouble with a  drug dealer. Mark shaves his beard. Tommy gets drunk on an unusual  cocktail made from mixing whiskey and vodka. Lisa lies and tells  everyone that Tommy hit her in a drunken rage.  A balding psychologist appears out of nowhere, offers some advice, then  apparently dies while softly falling on the ground in an attempt to  catch a football thrown by Mark.  All of these seemingly disparate events build up to two cathartic  moments. The first is when Tommy expressively yells at Lisa with the  line 'You are tearing me apart Lisa!'. You will cheer at this line as  you realize that the film has been tearing you apart the whole time.  And the second is at Tommy's birthday party where the worst actor that  has ever been born plays a unidentified man wearing a silk shirt who  utters a phrase that perfectly describes the experience of watching The  Room,  'It feels like I'm sitting on atom bomb that is going to explode!'  The shocking ending will leave you pleading for some kind of sequel.  See this film at all costs. See it twice. Or three times. Or as one kid  that I met from Woodland Hills has, 12 times! See it until you can  recite every precious line of dialogue this movie has to offer. Let The  Room become your new religion and Tommy Wiseau your prophet preaching  the gospel according to Johnny.  My dream is to someday buy a theater and run The Room 24 hours a day, 7  days a week until the print disintegrates. I hope it becomes your dream  as well.",

THE ROOM is one of those rare laugh-riots that is so fantastically inept as to border on genius. While most bad movies offer a handful of terrible scenes divided by stretches of just plain dull, writer-director-producer-star Tommy Wiseau's film offers one moment of disaster after another.Whether it's the made-up-by-fifth-graders dialogue, the deer-in-headlights performances, or the positively icky sex scenes (love those smushed rose petals on the chubby girl's back), you'll be howling from start to finish.This movie has already amassed a cult of people who know what to yell at the screen and when; for a movie that's being self-distributed, this rates as some kind of crap-movie miracle.Keep an eye out for the pointless insert shots of San Francisco, which give the idea of time passing even when it doesn't: one party scene, for example, features eight of these cut-aways.You really can't believe how terrible THE ROOM is, but at least it's entertaining, albeit in ways that the lazy-eyed, odd-bodied, English-mangling auteur never imagined.

            "content": "I have to believe I'm not the only person who was prompted to see \"The Room\" in preparation for James Franco's well-received \"The Disaster Artist,\" the story of the cult classic's creation.Called the worst movie ever made by many, what I think people mean is that \"The Room\" is one of the most entertaining bad movies ever made. It's certainly not the worst; just try watching a movie like, say, \"ThanksKilling\" for an example of a movie so bad that it's unwatchable. No, \"The Room\" belongs to the same category as something like \"Battlefield Earth,\" films so earnestly made yet so poorly executed that they become more entertaining than they would have been had the filmmakers been able to make a legitimately good movie.One can't really provide a description of \"The Room\" that will come anywhere close to approximating the experience of watching it. Tommy Wiseau, the film's legendary and strange creator, plays Johnny, who's been dating Lisa for something like six or seven years and who he refers to throughout the entire movie as \"my future wife.\" The problem is that Lisa hates Tommy and doesn't want to marry him, despite bonking him repeatedly. It never seems to occur to Lisa that she could just tell Johnny she doesn't love him anymore, so she instead complains to everyone who will listen to her how bored she is by him and even makes up stories about him getting drunk and beating her. No one seems especially bothered by this prospect, perhaps because Lisa is such an unpleasant person that we don't understand why Johnny wants her in the first place. O.k. maybe it's not so far fetched, since Johnny isn't the sharpest knife in the drawer, and his prospects for female companionship that he doesn't have to pay for are probably limited. He clearly is drawn to Lisa's formidable intelligence, because he thinks her suggestion that they invite a bunch of friends to a birthday party she plans to throw for him (despite hating him) is \"a great idea,\" which I guess is if the alternative idea is to invite a bunch of random strangers. And Johnny isn't alone; at said birthday party, she suggest that they should all eat some cake, and the party goers act like that's an idea no one's ever had at a birthday party before.Complicating matters is Johnny's best friend Mark, who gives a brilliant discourse on gender politics in which he categorizes all women as stupid or evil. Given the women in this movie, he may be on to something. Lisa has the hots for Mark, and they pick the least comfortable spot in the apartment (the bend of a spiral staircase) on which to consummate their passion (though I'm not sure if anything was actually consummated since Mark appears to be humping Lisa's knees). Mark seems like a bit of dim bulb himself, since every time thereafter that Lisa initiates sex his first question is \"What are you doing?\" The most mysterious character in the movie is Denny, an orphaned kid who lives God knows where but who pops in all. the. time. and who we're told thinks of Johnny as a father figure, though, given the fact that the first scene with Denny finds him wanting to watch Johnny and Lisa have sex, he might have wanted to shop around a bit more. Denny is always carrying either a basketball or a football and acts like he's twelve despite the fact that the actor playing him is about twenty-five. Once in a while, some combination of guys will actually play ball with him, which involves standing about three feet from each other and gently tossing the ball around like it's an explosive device. After some ball tossing on the roof of Johnny's apartment building, and then some more ball tossing in a cramped alley, I started to wonder whether or not San Francisco had any parks these guys could go to, and then later in the film when they actually go to a park, I wondered why they didn't go to one sooner.My favorite character is Lisa's mom, who walks into every situation and expresses disbelief that she's surrounded by dipsh*ts, a sentiment I shared. Nothing phases this woman, not breast cancer, not drug dealers, not random people using her daughter's apartment for a booty call. Whatever's going on, she's just so over it. And another supporting character is Johnny's psychologist friend, who looks like the bald Nazi from \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" and lurks in the background, lit by the camera man like a serial killer.Every scene in \"The Room\" feels like the intro to porn sex, no matter what combination of people are present. There are actually a couple of soft core scenes, both featuring Johnny and Lisa, though it actually only counts as one scene since the second one uses the EXACT SAME FOOTAGE as the first. Needless to say, they're not very erotic unless you find weirdly veiny men of an indeterminate age erotic, or are turned on by the sight of rose petals mashed into a woman's back like giant ticks.I don't know why \"The Room\" is called \"The Room.\" There is a room in the movie, in which almost all of the action that doesn't occur on the roof takes place. The set decorator clearly thought that Johnny and Lisa are the kind of people who decorate their apartment with giant candles and bowls of fruit, which comes in handy when Denny needs to eat an apple as a way of managing the sexual frustration that occurs when Johnny and Lisa aren't up for a menage a trois.Maybe he should have played some football in the alley instead. Hah- hah! Hah-hah!Grade: F (for not having even a minimum understanding of the art of narrative filmmaking)Grade: A+ (for entertainment value)",

Oh hi, Mark.\" \u2013 Tommy Wiseau (The Room) Released in 2003, \"The Room\" would have faded into obscurity had it not, like most of Ed Wood's films, possessed the right mixture of sincerity, god-awful ineptness, and unintentional humour. Within months the film had become a cult classic, playing in packed Los Angeles theatres to legions of screaming fans.What makes the film hilarious is Tommy Wiseau, a talentless and egotistical auteur, who wrote, directed, produced, financed and starred in this six million dollar flick. The classic self-important European artist, Wiseau sees himself, not only as a serious actor, but a serious writer and director. He thinks he's written a Shakespearean plot, when in reality this is a childish love triangle. He thinks his dialogue flies like Tennessee Williams, but in reality it is worse than that offered by the Disney Channel. He thinks his direction rivals Cassavetes, but in reality...well, he was so confused, he shot the film on both HD and celluloid cameras, mounted side by side because he didn't know which camera was which.And yet there is something captivating about Wiseau's performance. His accent is odd, he approaches each word from a strange angle, he puts emphasis on the wrong syllables, he structures sentences in off kilter rhythms, he inserts punctuation in the wrong places and has his dialogue branch off in weird tangents. Listening to Wiseau speak is like watching the English language being re-invented. It should be god awful, but it's strangely interesting. Like David Mamet, his intonations, his verbal tempo, is almost balletic.Whilst all the actors in the film are bad \u2013 soft-core porn bad \u2013 Wiseau imbues the film with a kind of transcendent badness. He's not bad, so much as he is unaware of the rules of good. He's so earnest, so confident that his performance, that his art, is the epitome of quality, that his ineptness renders the whole production farcical.With regards to the film's plot, there are themes of cancer, betrayal, drug abuse, and infidelity, but it's all handled in an awkward way akin to a kindergarten play. At times whole lines of dialogue are dubbed over, often with no regard to the actor's lip movements. Like Ed Wood's \"Plan Nine From Outer Space\", characters are also oddly replaced by other actors half way through the film, no explanation given. Throw in countless shots of the Golden Gate Bridge, an epically stupid ending, some hilariously badly written dialogue \u2013 \"Leave your stupid comment in your pocket!\", \"Chocolate is a symbol of love!\", \"What kind of money?\", \"I definitely have breast cancer\", \"I needed money so I bought drugs!\", \"I'm fed up of this wur-urld!\" - and you have the funniest \"so bad it's good\" film since Ed Wood.7.5/10 \u2013 Comedy gold.

He has been described as \"Borat trying to do an impression of Christopher Walken playing a mental patient\". How apt.",

            "content": "Oh, wow, um, where do I even begin with this movie? I suppose I could tell you how I heard of it, like most people I heard about this movie from an internet reviewer(the Nostalgia Critic). I honestly would've never heard of this film either, probably would have never seen it. But after the clips I saw, I HAD to see this movie, I went on Amazon.com immediately afterwards and ordered it. Now I knew this movie was going to be bad, but I HAD NO IDEA! I think it's one of those movies that had to be handled in clips because I cannot tell you all the safety precautions you should take before watching this movie. My boyfriend tried to commit suicide while I just wanted to find Tommy Wiseau and do some things that even the Dark One would look at me and say \"geez, take it easy on the guy\". I cannot even describe how this movie is bad. The acting is like the actors are literally reading the script for the first time. Tommy Wiseau's acting, I don't know if there's a word for how bad it is so we'll just say it's \"aguwaba\", also it seems his voice was dubbed over. Now I thought this was because maybe he only speaks one language that isn't English, but he speaks with this stupid indefinable accent all the time, so why is his dubbing the same way? Where is he from? Brazil, Romania, France\u0085? I have no idea.Lisa has become inexplicably dissatisfied with her fianc\u00e9 Johnny, confiding to her best friend Michelle and her mother Claudette that she finds him boring. Lisa seduces Johnny's best friend Mark, and they begin an affair that continues throughout the film, even as Mark more than once tries to break it off. As the wedding date approaches and Johnny's clout at his bank slips, Lisa gets closer to leaving Johnny for Mark. When Lisa throws Johnny a surprise birthday party, she flaunts her affair in front of Johnny, and Johnny and Mark get into two altercations. Johnny has also attached a tape recorder to the telephone, recording an intimate call between his future wife and Mark. Now that Johnny is \"fed up with this world\", feeling like he cannot trust anyone, he pulls the ultimate punishment in self loathing to himself but a true gift to the audience.This movie is just incredible that it was made, I didn't think it was possible to make a film so bad. It's like it's a new genre, just a bad movie. Sub plots get brought up out of no where in this movie and never get brought up again. Characters get brought up and again never mentioned. The script, story, characters, editing, setting, everything was just wrong with this movie. Also Tommy Wiseau's name is mentioned 6 times before the film even begins and his character is of course \"perfect\" that everyone should just love him. Lisa, who is very odd looking, is constantly called \"sexy\" which either has a new definition or is ironic. Mark is a doof ball that probably thinks that penguins are fish, because he's just that stupid. Denny is a perverted 15 year old who wants to watch Johnny and Lisa make love and constantly says how in love with Lisa he is and how he loves Johnny. Also there is so many pointless love scenes, football scenes, gift giving scenes, lines, if there was a drinking game on the pointless scenes for this film, you'd die of alcohol poisoning by the end of this movie. I don't know, it is one of those films you have to see to believe, but I can tell you one thing for sure, if Tommy Wiseau thinks we're laughing with him, he should check that we're actually laughing at him.1/10",

Writer, director, producer and star Tommy Wiseau thinks so. The rumor is he submitted the film to the Academy for consideration as best picture. Sadly, he was turned away. \"The Room\" may not be the best picture of the year, but is probably the single greatest film of all time, at least from a purely entertaining point of view.Yes, the love scenes are recycled. Yes, some of the dialog makes no sense. Yes, there are countless subplots that go nowhere. Yes, one of the main characters disappears halfway through and is replaced by another guy. Yes, the music is bad. Yes, yes, yes.

San Fransico represents the city that gave birth to free love - and this is subtly juxtaposed with the theme of the film, that love is not free. Johnny's apartment has a spiral staircase indicating that the path to meaningful congress isn't straight forward, as evidenced by Lisa's liaison on the stairs. The many scenes on the roof top actually represent reaching a higher level of understanding. The transcendental if you will.The football - the football represents Lisa, a woman who is prepared to be passed from man to man, and indeed those that are not prepared for her suffer a literal downfall. It is symbolism and beautiful metaphor.The dress - this is Johnny's subconscious awareness of Lisa's true reality expressed in Jungian terms. He is bestowing on her the role of the Scarlet Woman.The rose - When Johnny places the rose on the bed next to Lisa he is saying \" I am replacing one prick in this bed with several pricks\" How true he is! The white car - this is in fact Johnny's white steed. Symbolism for him being the good guy.The repeated scene - don't believe all you read. The lovemaking scene is repeated, not for budgetary reasons or the actress' dislike of Tommy; rather it indicates that the lovemaking has become boring and literally repetitious.The Tuxedos - these symbolise Johnny's identity loss and awareness of mass consciousness.The Psychologist - forsaking the R.D Laing school of thought, he is unable to identify the existential angst of the other characters and after his symbolic downfall plays no further part in their lives.Chris R - this is in fact a scathing critique of the American Health Care system. Denny is obviously using him to get extra supplies of the Ritalin he so badly requires.The alcohol - the Scarlet Woman Lisa tempts Johnny away from the path of virtue by intoxicating him with the noxious substances of two cultures - whiskey and vodka, representing the intoxicating combination of their pairing.The names - Johnny, the 'everyman', a name used in countless films in the 40's and 50's. His everyman status is reinforced by the florists failure to recognise him until he removes that which alters his perception of the world. His sunglasses. Lisa represents 'everywoman'. Notice how the other characters have lovers called Betty and Elizabeth. Claudette - literally 'Claw Debt' - a woman obsessed by her own and others financial situation.Genetic determinism - Lisa was born out of a loveless relationship and is therefore doomed to repeat such behaviour. Her mother's breast cancer represents the transmission of this through suckling.The spoons - one is reminded of Heideggers contemplation of the representation of boots in art. The spoons are there for aesthetic rather than utility purposes. This shows that one does not always get 'one's just desserts' ( Get your coat, you're fired - Ed)",

            "content": "Johnny, a man thanks to whom a bank makes lots of money, did not get his promotion but he's way too busy trying to be American by throwing footballs around at any given opportunity to really mind that. And he's also about to get married to Lisa who's in some computer business of some kind but she's having an affair with Mark, Johnny's best friend, who does not want to hurt Johnny but clearly can't help himself. Danny, Johnny and Lisa's young sexually confused neighbour who has problems of his own somewhat related to drugs and football fetching, doesn't suspect a thing although he's always hovering about and is also in love with Lisa but would rather watch Lisa and Johnny in bed when he's not fetching Johnny's balls. The only person who knows what is afoot between Johnny and Lisa is Lisa's mother who begs her daughter to come to her senses but in vain since no one listens to her and... she's dying... since she DEFINITELY has breast cancer (which is okay since \"they're curing people everyday\"). Confused? Well don't be...And welcome to the wondrous world of \"The Room\". This is a world from the breathtaking lack of imagination of Tommy Wiseau, the least appealing man ever to walk this Earth; a world where people play football in tuxedo, have the same conversations again and again due to their 5 minutes memory, make babies by humping belly buttons in the middle of rose petals and finally enter and exit places without any other reason than to do just that.Indeed, this is probably one of the worst film ever made but as opposed to any other cinematic turd, this one is hardly ever dull (except for the \"sex\" scenes maybe), the aimless plot driven through one stupidity to the other by the on-par grammar-school writing delivering gems galore (\"I'm so happy I have you as my best friend and I love Lisa so much\", \"I'm tired. I'm wasted. I love you darling\"), the final broth served by inept performances (for want of a better word) from its cast. This is truly the most inspired disaster ever committed to screen.But what I find the most interesting about the \"The Room\" is its maker Tommy Wiseau. \"The Room\" is a window into his confused psyche because make no mistake folks: Tommy IS Johnny. And what are we told about Johnny? Well that \"he's very caring about the people in his life\", provides for his girlfriend, \"is very sensitive\", \"doesn't drink\", \"has a very secure situation\" and has nice pecs. Quite a catch wouldn't you say ladies? On paper possibly... Because everything about his persona seems phoney: his accent which is a mix of anyone's that ever walk this planet whom couldn't speak English, his over-sized suit, his dark, long and way too greasy hair, his geriatric body posture, his re-shaped and re-muddled face and, above all, his completely dry and humourless laughter (and not in a sarcastic way either). Such a penchant for dissimulation is downright creepy and I must admit, the physical repulsion he exerts on me is the stuff fascination is made of.The fact that \"The Room\" has gathered such a cult following is no surprise. In the oh-so jaded times we're living in, celebrating the mediocre, talentless and pointless have become all the rage with the recipient of the mockery confusing infamy with fame. There is something both pathetic and a little unsettling about how Tommy Wiseau regards the cynical interests his movie has attracted for a genuine recognition of his talent.Mind you, I suppose Mr Wiseau can take pride in the fact that \"The Room\" will go down in Cinema history. But as what?",

            "content": "OK, that may be a stretch, but I have inside knowledge into the facts. You see, I was fortunate enough to have worked on the film. As I read the reviews here, especially the last one, which I am sure was written by our amazing Director/Actor/Producer/Writer, I felt I had to respond. Having the dubious honor of saying I worked on this film, has also brought with it the responsibility of telling the truth about what happened on set. Apparently Tommy had a lot of money sitting around and decided he needed to make a film. Not being able to decide what to shoot, film or video, we shot both. Side by side. Both cameras on the same head, being operated by one camera operator. We shot almost the whole thing in the parking lot and back storage shed (read- sound stage) of a camera rental house in Hollywood. I got the call to work on the show after they had already tried to start with another crew that ended up all being dismissed. I believe that we ended up being crew 2 of 4. The show never had much organization to it from the start. We were told it would be a 3 week shoot. At the end of 3 weeks we were exactly 1/2 way done. Crew calls were usually 8 a.m. tommy would show up around 10:30 or 11. Because he would take the HD video camera home with him every night, we had no choice but to wait for him. Since we were only in one room or outside the door in the parking lot, we did not have anything to do but sit around and wait every day. When Tommy arrived we would have to see if he was in actor mode or director mode. If he was in actor mode, you were not allowed to talk to him so he could \"stay in character.\" Since he was in almost every scene, he was always in his \"actor\" mode. This also meant that he could not direct. Noting the huge delays every day and the fact that we were never seeming to get anything done, our wonderful script supervisor stepped up and became the director...at least he tried. One day he had to go off and do another show and asked if anyone else wanted to step up and direct and keep some script notes. When nobody volunteered, I stepped up. I loved it. It was my directorial genius that had tommy bump into Lisa as they were taking the bad guy off the roof! I will also take credit for the now famous line \"You are tearing me apart, Lisa!\" In the first 10 takes, tommy kept saying \"You are TAKING me apart!\" As the crew tried to keep it together, I felt I should right the situation and corrected the line. The crew was also instrumental in keeping the chicken line in. \"CHEEEEEPPPPPPP, CHEEP, CHEEP, CHEEP, CHEEP!\" We begged our scripty/director to keep him doing it take after take. Though the crew ultimately followed the original DP out the door and quit, we are all proud to have taken part in the making of this film. Amongst the film crew realms, we are minor celebrities. \"Dude, you worked on that thing?\" is a phrase that is often heard when The Room is mentioned.I have the pleasure of driving through Hollywood every day and still seei ng the billboard for the film up and Tommy glaring at me as if to say, \"I telled you I could make movie.\" For those looking for a photo op, it's on Highland, a few blocks south of Sunset. I know that tommy took out an ad in the trade papers asking \"For Your Consideration\", I only wished that I could see him on stage accepting an Academy Award. It would be well earned. Rumor has it that he has a vampire film in the works... let's hope so... I only hope I get the opportunity to work on it. I can only hope that The Room becomes a cult classic with midnight showings. I'll put my tux on and bring a football. Perhaps I'll stand up for a Q&A afterward and tell the stories I have so fondly tried to burn from my memory. My other dream is for the DVD. There are 100's of hours of behind the scenes footage out there. The camera for the behind the scenes material was always recording. ALWAYS! It will be awesome to see what took place on our set. I hope he puts it out there. I know I would buy several copies for all my friends and family.Any questions?",

            "content": "Tommy Wiseau...who is this guy? The IMDb biography is pretty scant and his vaguely Eastern European accent is not at all explained. What also isn't explained is how he was able to somehow get $6,000,000 to make this film--as well as HOW it could cost that much to make this movie. After all, none of the actors are professionals (and it shows), the sets look like they are the homes of Wiseau or his friends and Wiseau himself wrote/directed/starred in the film. So where did all the money go?! Perhaps some could have been spent on TVs (see the end to know what I mean). I think most young filmmakers could do just as well with $47 and a HandyCam and chimp actors! \"The Room\" seems to have nothing to do with a room. Instead, it's like a soft-core porno film where the camera gets blocked anytime you are about to see most of the nudity. I counted something like 6 sex cenes--3 of which were in the first 25 minutes!! So is the film therefore sexy--God no!! I will be nice and not make any more comments about this--you just have to see the writhing bodies to know what I mean. After all, I'm a middle-aged chubby guy and so I don't have much room to talk. But wait, I am NOT starring in a film...so yes, I can say that they were kind of scary looking--particularly Wiseau. So, if there was an award for least sexy film, this one might win....unless Ernest Borgnine made a porno.So why has this film become a cult favorite? It's the dialog....and the acting to a lesser extent. It's as if much of the dialog were written by someone with only a limited knowledge of the English language. So often the same catch phrases are repeated again and again. And often what characters say seems very, very random. And, to make it worse, the post-production dubbing is hilariously out of sync at times. Honestly, the dialog in \"Plan 9\" is no worse--especially since Wood was not trying to make a serious film--whereas \"The Room\" is deadly serious.Is it ONLY the dialog and acting? Well, no. The writing is god-awful--inconsistent, with missing plot lines AND the inexplicable need for all the men to suddenly break into a game of tossing the football--even though they are only 3-5 feet apart and even when they are in tuxedos! I can clearly understand why at L.A. showings of the film, crowd members reportedly bring footballs and toss them about during the film! And, the musical dubbing is occasionally terrible. And, the plot is dull. And, there's the problem with Wiseau's character being the greatest yutz in film history--knowing that his girlfriend is cheating on him near the beginning of the film yet continuing to stay with her AND doing the funniest temper-tantrum scene in film history late in the movie (he should have yelled \"Hulk SMASH!!!\").By the way, the film says the couple in the film have been together five years and then later in the film it says seven. Either way, considering the age of Wiseau's co-star, she would have been between 11 and 13 when they first became a couple.Also, on the DVD there is an interview with Wiseau. You must see this--the dubbing was hilarious even for this 'making of' mini-films! Plus it tries to explain the repeated use of footballs in his film! And, he wears a nice suit.In conclusion, I must quote the film. \"Why, Johnny,...why?!?...\"",

Things start to escalate...Regarded as one of the worst movies of all time, and rightly so. Written, directed and starring Tommy Wiseau, the crappiness is largely a solo effort. Incredibly badly written: the dialogue is so bad to be quite bizarre at times. The central plot - the Johnny-Lisa-Mark love triangle - has no depth at all and really just goes around in circles. The lack of substance in the central plot is padded by random sub-plots and scenes that add nothing. Acting is about as bad as the writing, with Tommy Wiseau to the fore, again. He is so bad he makes Arnold Schwarzenegger look like Marlon Brando. \"Hammy\" doesn't even come close to describing how bad he is, sometimes looking like he is just reciting lines that he is wholly disinterested in (which he wrote!) and then delivering in a ridiculously melodramatic manner (\"You're tearing me apart, Lisa!\" launched a thousand gifs). The remaining cast aren't great but aren't anywhere near as bad as Wiseau. They are helped by being in the same scene as him as he's so bad he makes them look okay.Direction is pretty much uninspired paint-by-numbers, though is not as laughable as the script or acting.There are no redeeming qualities to this movie. It's not accidentally a decent comedy while trying to be a serious drama. No \"So bad, it's good\" for it. This movie is incredibly bad, full stop.",

It is liberating and hilarious and downright therapeutic to shout, when a character who has never been established suddenly appears on screen, \"Who are you?\" Wiseau shows up at these Los Angeles screenings and revels in what he seems to think is adoration, almost psychotically not in on the joke.You do not go to \"The Room\" to see a movie. You go to get even with that screen that promises entertainment and often disappoints. Finally, you get to mock mediocrity. It's enjoyable and liberating.

            "content": "Ten-plus years since its release, it's safe to say that \"The Room\", conceived, written, directed, and produced by lead actor Tommy Wiseau, has become a phenomenon. Making less in its initial release than your average paralegal rakes in on one paycheck--*after* taxes--The Room has become the Rocky Horror Picture Show of its generation, with midnight screenings and various rituals enacted by its fans. Numerous online critics, including the Nostalgia Critic, CinemaSins, and Obscurus Lupa, have had a merry time taking the movie apart--oh, sorry, *TEARING THE MOVIE APART, LISA!!!!* And yes, the movie is one of the movies that is truly so bad it's good. The script, and Wiseau's delivery of his lines, are guaranteed to make you smile for all the wrong reasons, so it qualifies as a guilty pleasure, too. And after seeing all the online hatchet jobs, I decided, \"Hey, it's on YouTube, and for free--why not enjoy it again?\" Unfortunately, by this time, the joke had worn off. Barely fifteen minutes into the movie, I was bored out of my mind. Camp comedy doesn't have a long shelf life in general, and when you outgrow it, you're left with the appalling mess that is The Room.The problem, obviously, is Tommy Wiseau, wholly and entirely. The Room is his story--his baby, if you will. It flows completely out of his understanding of American culture and the human condition--and it fails because Wiseau's understanding of American culture and the human condition is utterly and completely superficial.He knows, for example, that Americans in general love football, but he doesn't understand *why* we do, or that we put football aside when we have more pressing concerns (like a wedding). He knows that banks handle money, but he doesn't understand that an investment banker (which is what I'm presuming Johnny is, because I doubt very much he's a teller at your corner Citibank) is primarily in the business of *making* money, not just saving it. Johnny shouldn't be talking about how he saved the bank money; he should be talking about private placements and hedge funds. And so on and so on.Wiseau shows a similar ignorance of human character and relationships. The oft-mocked breast cancer line is actually an opportunity for Wiseau to explore the concept of \"like parent, like child\"--if Lisa is manipulative and willing to tell outrageous lies to get what she wants, where's the most logical place for her to learn such behavior? This would also make Lisa's lack of reaction to the line more understandable. But Wiseau apparently doesn't have any grasp of the relationships between parents and their children; for all that he makes use of their relationship, Claudette and Lisa might as well be neighbors, co-workers, or perfect strangers rather than mother and daughter.The result is a script that makes no sense whatsoever, because Wiseau started by ignoring the first rule of writing, \"Write what you know\", and proceeded to blow off the second rule, \"If you don't know it, do your research.\" Compounding the problem is Wiseau's complete lack of understanding of script structure; like a bad Off-Off-Broadway play, subplots come out of nowhere with absolutely no setup (for example, the Chris-R scene) or start and are dropped without any development (for example, the breast cancer line).Much has been made of the performances in The Room, but I will be blunt: if you could reach back in time and take great film actors to do the roles when they were the right ages to do so--say, a 1930s Laurence Olivier as Tommy, a 1970s Meryl Streep for Lisa, a 1960s Dustin Hoffman for Mark, etc.--they still wouldn't be able to do much with this script. The complete lack of depth means that none of the actors can give more than a surface performance, although a few--Robyn Paris and Carolyn Minnott, mostly--manage to at least make their characters somewhat interesting.Still, it's a good laugh, right? And yes, it is--the first two or three times you see it. Afterwards, the joke doesn't have the same impact. What made you laugh hysterically the first time you saw the movie only makes you grin now, and what made you grin only makes you roll your eyes.And eventually, the elephant in the room (no pun intended) makes itself known. This is about Tommy Wiseau. That's why the script gives Johnny absolutely no flaws: he's funny (so Wiseau thinks), generous (ditto), brave (not even armed drug dealers scare him!), philosophical, is everybody's friend, and everybody's \"favorite customer\". Wiseau, we realize, cannot afford to consciously give Johnny any warts to his character because that would undermine his own fragile self-esteem. And the amusement we feel at the joke of The Room turns into an uncomfortable feeling in the pit of our stomach, and a vague sense of guilt that we were laughing at this person in the first place.",

It's kind of like watching a train crash in slow motion - random, incoherent, disastrous, accidental and ultimately painful. The sense of alienation emanating from this film places the audience extremely far from being able to relate to what's happening on screen, which leaves a lot of room for uncontrollable laughter given the right circumstances.The camera work and production techniques would not be out of place in many daytime soap operas, nor would the script and plot, but there is an undefinable quality which separates this movie from the sense mediocrity often found in such shows and instead casts it deep into the abyss of tragically bad film making where it will be forever trapped along with Wiseau's artistic integrity.

The Room is not a black comedy as arrogant writer, star, distributor, producer and obviously blind director, Tommy Wiseau would want you to believe.

Is this a joke and I got the wrong \"film\" that people are talking about?Believe it or not, I had to consult with a professional critic and he actually confirmed that this is, in fact, a movie. And that he's seen it. And then I heard a gunshot and a loud thud. His poor, poor children.While he didn't actually die, you'll want to roughly 10 seconds into The Room. Die laughing, perhaps, at its amazing lack of direction and incredibly, there are two men fighting over the director credit: Wiseau (huh. WISEau?) and Sandy Schklair. Hmmm. Would you have fought with Pilate when he claimed to be the murderer of Jesus?In a \"movie\" (from here on out, that word will be very loosely associated with The Room) that even the dialogue sounds like it was dubbed \u00e0 la Rumble in the Bronx, even though everyone's speaking English \u2013 if you can call it that, you'll quickly learn what NOT to do. Such as the ever so comical \"shots\" of San Francisco and the unfortunate Golden Gate Bridge which probably would've asked for a cut if this made more than a tenth of a penny.Recently I re-watched and reviewed the brilliant The Big Lebowski, and I stated towards the end that it should be actually studied in film school, if not already. I'll say the same here, but obviously at the other end of the spectrum.You almost feel sorry for the labeled \"director\" Wiseau, if not for his arrogance \u2013 SEE: poster for proof. Ironically, his follow-up was Homeless in America, and if America did have anything to do with it, he would be. But can you really be mad at the guy for this atrocity? Well, if he stayed in the background, and not in more than 75% of screen-time, you might feel some pity.And his writing? It's as if he was a stone-cold foreigner who watched a lot of American Sitcoms of the 1950s and used an English Translating Dictionary to produce the words spoken on screen. Sure, it's hilarious to hear him, or any of them speak, but it's also sad when someone who apparently isn't familiar with the language, culture or modest enough to hire someone to even take a 30-second peek at the screenplay. Personally, I wouldn't jump over to Paris and write a movie on the life and times of the natives using both a French for Dummies guide and my memory of French class in High School nearly two decades back. Is Paris is Burning already taken? Oh.The \"movie\" follows a confused blonde (duh) named Lisa (Danielle) who unsure of her pending nuptials to Johnny (Wiseau.) Who would be when you're about to marry the love child of G\u00e9rard Depardieu and Bob Dylan? So\u0085she sleeps around and shows the camera she's not ashamed of her (probably bought) breasts.That's pretty much the plot. Throw in some laugh-out-loud 15-second subplot of a boy, Denny (Haldiman) who both likes to watch and do daaaangerous narcotics and a mother who looks as confused as George W. Bush without a speech to read.The actors, unbelievably, took this seriously. I would show more compassion for them, but even with a $1,000,000 scholarship to the New York Film Academy, they'd still fail later on.I've been told this is a great midnight movie experience, i.e. the astonishingly superior The Rocky Horror Picture Show. Perhaps. But, even at 99 minutes, it drags and my laughter nearly died, from pure exhaustion, towards the end. Fortunately, the SURPRISE! ending brought me back up to laughing hard.That all said, well\u0085this entire review, I'd still recommend this \"movie.\" How could you miss an opportunity like this? I seriously thought Troll 2 could never ever happen again. Improbably, lightning struck twice. First with a movie that's called Troll 2 that doesn't even involve trolls and now with The Room that's not even about one.",

Although Tommy \"What the hell am I saying?\" Wiseau may be lauding his film as reminiscent of Tennessee Williams, the closest it comes to anything I've seen by Williams is that I had to get up to pee three times during it. Crap writing, Crap acting, Crap directing...but the movie as a whole? So deliciously crap that it can only be considered CRAPTASTIC! Nobody seems to know where Tommy is from, although the consensus seems to be somewhere in Eastern Europe. So I have decided to consider his point of origin, Ridiculouslovania. Have we been sending out the wrong signals? Is this really what Ridiculouslovanians think about us? I never stand three feet from my friends and toss a football. Never.

It's an exercise in shoddy filmmaking, but there's something about it that's just . . . well, it's just a whole lot of fun. And yes, I do mean it's a lot of fun to bag on this hot mess, but doing so has never felt so satisfying.If you boil this movie down to its base elements, Johnny loves Lisa, Lisa cheats on Johnny. Why does she? Ehh, not really sure. It's not like he deserved it, really - I mean, he's a super nice guy. He's not the best looking guy, but she didn't seem to have a problem with it. And the rest of the movie is just Lisa being a galactic hussy (seriously, they don't come more arbitrarily two-timing than this).There's a lot here that goes unanswered. What happened with the mother-in-law's cancer? Will Denny get off drugs? Why does Mark turn on Johnny? You can tell this is supposed to be a big tragedy, kind of an inept Tennessee Williams joint. But nothing about this comes off like it should. Subplots are introduced and then forgotten, the dialogue's full of non-sequiturs, and there's not really any meaning to anything. Add to that the bad green-screening and the Skinemax production values, and you're witnessing a veritable trainwreck.But, my god, is it entertaining. Ninety minutes chock-full of unintentional hilarity. The reputation is there for a reason, and it's definitely earned. The \"so-bad-it's-good\" label is thrown around so often these days, but it truly applies here.In the best way possible.8/10",

Many consider it the worst movie ever made, however after watching I disagree, as I liked it the film was blended with drama and twist of love and lust that lead to bad means for all involved as really it was a good black hearted comedy.Set in the city by the bay \"San Francisco\", Johnny(Tommy Wiseau) is a successful investment banker who enjoys life and love as he plans to marry his younger and sexy girlfriend Lisa(Juliette Danielle). However this is the game of life it's not always a bed of roses(unlike the love making scenes!)as lust, passion, lies, and betrayal take over.Johnny has a best friend named Mark(Greg Sestero) and all three become involved in a web a deadly game of temptation as these games slowly, but surely lead to loss for all involved. This film is a great take and spin on life, love, and friendship, as can anyone be trusted? It proves love runs deep, yet when lust and passion mix it's a deadly combination. Overall well done movie that teaches lessons in a painful way, and the movie is spiced up by love making scenes and the acting and on screen chemistry between the actors is good for a low budget independent that would become a historical cult classic.",

It's a sad testament to the state of intelligence of some, but that doesn't detract from the movies awful redemption.There was no way this was made as a 'black comedy' on purpose. The ineptness present in ALL aspects of the film could only come about through an attempt to put Tommy's own high-school angsty experiences (probably) on tape.

            "content": "Sometimes it's difficult knowing where to start in reviewing a movie. This film is perhaps the ultimate example where words are simply not enough. The Room is a film that almost defies description. It really has to be experienced in order to understand why it has garnered a reputation as the most celebrated bad movie of the last decade. Unlike previous so-bad-they're-good flicks such as Plan 9 From Outer Space or Troll 2 and countless others, The Room is not a sci-fi, horror or action flick. It is pure and simply a melodrama. This explains part of its huge impact in that it sort of appeals to both male and female audiences alike, while it is really quite unusual to see a film in this genre being quite so spectacularly bad. The Room is undoubtedly one of the funniest things I have seen in a long, long time.I'm not going to go into specifics here as to individual moments that make The Room the comedy classic that it has become, simply because there are far too many and it really needs to be seen to be believed. However, it would be remiss to not mention the character Johnny played by Tommy Wiseau. Johnny is the central character in the story. He is an overly nice character who others take advantage of. He seems to either be retarded or is recovering from a stroke. Wiseau is a very unusual central character, while his sex scenes are deeply disturbing - almost like scenes from a scary sci-fi horror film. Wiseau is of course the auteur behind this thing, he wrote and directed it and so therefore needs to be given some credit for producing something that is simultaneously so bad yet so committed and so deadly serious. He has attempted to claim after the event that The Room was intended as a black comedy. Don't be fooled by this for a second, this movie plays it completely straight. It's so very funny because of this fact. It is an absolute impossibility to make the specific anti-genius of The Room intentionally.I have seen it a couple of times. The second of which was at a public screening and I have to report that I have never witnessed anything like it. It was the closest a movie-going experience ever got to the feel of going to a gig. The sense of excitement beforehand was palpable and once the movie started rolling the audience was extremely lively throughout with no let up from start to finish. It ended with a standing ovation. It was quite incredible. I have never witnessed the like before. Tommy Wiseau I salute you.",

It was a hallucination, I never saw it, and Wiseau must be a professional kick-boxer whom I'd somehow mixed up with some silly Z-dramas I'd seen from before... and... and... Ah,... it's no use denying it anymore: I've never taken a gram of drugs in my life so this movie DOES exist, it actually WAS made, so now we have yet another major mystery on our hands, right up there with the Bermuda Triangle and Spike Lee's career. How could this have happened? Who talks like this? (Aside from mongoloids, I mean.) These characters must all be aliens, especially Wiseau - and I don't just mean his out-of-this-world accent. Did TR get ejected from Xenu's derri\u00e8re? Was Scientology somehow involved? Was this Hubbard's last incomplete script, his one last message to Earthlings that life is too idiotic without proper brainwashing equipment to balance out the nonsense? Or perhaps this is a discarded double-episode of the \"X-Files\" with Mulder and Scully being Tippexed out of the movie, with only a dozen aliens being left in Frisco, with nothing better to do all day than have yucky sex and greet each other non-stop like lunatics in a loosely-guarded asylum. Why Venusians would live in SF (San Francisco, Sci Fi, get it??) is a mystery beyond all mysteries.\"Hi, John!\". \"Oh, hi, Frank!\". \"Hi, Mary!\" Half of the movie is people cheerfully greeting each other, like in those cheesy Learning To Speak English manuals for beginners. It is bizarre, it is stupideau, and I am afraid.Hungarian porn producers would reject this rubbish dialog on the grounds that it was too trashy and stupid. John Wasters would find better dialogue by sticking his hand into his toilet bowl after Divine did a no.2. Even Ed Wood, if faced with this script, would have considered a re-write of the first draft - for the first time in his entire life.In a sea of terrible actors, a duo stick out like two very sore thumbs. The abysmal-looking blonde, very absurdly cast as a seductress; she is basically Amy Lee from Evanescence, with a blonde wig attached to her empty head, impersonating an even chunkier Britney Spears, while trying not to stray too far from imitating Sid Vicious's girlfriend Nancy.And then we have the real star of this turd, Tommy Wiseau, a man who redefines human behaviour (his one true \"achievement\"). TW is proof that nowadays even porn actors can finance their writer-director-producer-actor pet projects. Wiseau looks like Fabio's rejected twin brother mixed with a tinge of Harvey Keitel's \"Taxi Driver\" pimp Sport.Wiseau talks in a sleepy monotone mixed in with at least a dozen different accents all jumbled together in a mysterious mish-mash. An alien? (I mean both the character he plays and the actual Wiseau.) I have never seen such a performance in my entire life. You will laugh, but your jaw will drop too. Wiseau must be a Martian. Forget bad, awful or disastrous: his acting is beyond such lame adjectives. I was literally stunned/shocked/stupefied every time he opened his mouth. His diction makes no sense, and the less said about the weird laughter the better... Bizarre to a fault.Wiseau's \"you're chi-cken, cheep-cheep-cheep\" moment is right up (or down) there with Plan 9's \"you stupid stupid minds!\".Yes. \"Chi-ckeeeen. Cheep-cheep-cheep.\" No, it's not a comedy. It's a miracle, and I will gladly join this new religion.TR actually won a prize: the Audience Award at the International NY Festival. Did Wiseau distribute free crack to the audience pre-projection, or did he threaten to break everyone's legs unless his little film got \"the respect it deserves\"?...",

            "content": "What can you say about The Room? Tommy Wiseau's anti-masterpiece is one of the best things I have ever seen. Not for mundane reasons such as quality acting, the written word, clever cinematography or engaging story. Rather, The Room is one of the most unintentionally hilarious and stupid films that I cannot recommend enough.The film really does revolve around Tommy Wiseau. He looks like a melted wax sculpture of Ozzie Osborne, and has the acting talent to match. He wrote the screenplay, but doesn't understand his own words when delivering them. He focuses on completely irrelevant material both as a director and as a writer - see the infamous football scene and the dramatic close-up of Mark's clean shaven face. Their importance is something we will just never know. As a director, Wiseau has no idea how to construct a scene. Characters just show up in places they have no reason to be. The confrontation with Chris-R on the rooftop has most of the main cast either arriving during the fight or apparently already there! How did Claudette and Lisa get to the top of the building, and why did it take so long for them to react? What made Tommy and Mark climb the building? In fact, why on earth was the confrontation on the roof to begin with? The screenplay has to be the most heinous thing I've ever listened to and I love it for that. Johnny bursts into \"cheep cheep\" noises at random opportunities, characters weave in and out of importance (Steven and Peter being the real examples) and around a half dozen subplots go unresolved. Mark's character changes between scenes - he has more personalities in his own body than the rest of the cast together. The real corker are some of the film's lines, which are more memorable than half of the Academy Award for Best Screenplay winners could produce put together. See below: - \"No I can't, anyway, how's your sex life?\" - \"Chocolate is the symbol of love\" - \"I feel like I'm sitting on an atom bomb that's about to explode\" - \"You betrayed me! You're not good. You, you're just a chicken. Chip-chip-chip-chip-cheep- cheep.\" - Lisa: Did you get your promotion? Johnny: Nah. (pause) Lisa: You didn't get it, did you? - I have to go see Michelle in a little bit to make out with her.The acting, well Tommy Wiseau aside, there's still nothing special here. One might be forgiven for suspecting another is watching porn when they are in fact watching the room. The only way you could really tell is by how fake the sex scenes look (though not for lack of nudity). Juliette Daniel and Greg Sestero really do just do what Wiseau tells them, even where it makes no sense. Phillip Haldiman is creepy but not Matt Damon (The Talented Mr. Ripley) or Paul Dano (Prisoners) creepy, just weird. I have to take a moment here to praise Carolyn Minnott. Not only is she clearly the most talented actress of the bunch, she bites off Wiseau's dreadful words. At one point she demands of Daniel \"Why bring it up if you don't want to talk about it?\" A large part of me feels that Minnott expresses her frustration with this dreadful production through this line, which is fantastic. The Room is a truly delightful display of narcissism on Tommy Wiseau's behalf. Everything seeks to show Johnny as a saint, even if it feels more forced than constipation. Its truly the worst movie ever made, and I love it.",

            "content": "Tommy Wiseau ranks among the greats: Spielberg, Scorcese, Griffith, & Welles.  In THE ROOM, he has created a piece of cinema that has no parallels.  It is a unique piece of artistic greatness.Let's first discuss Mr. Wiseau's expert crafting of dramatic tension. Denny, the slightly mentally retarded 20-year-old, wants to watch Johnny and Lisa make sweet love.  Denny also frequently acts like a brain-damaged Golden Retriever in that he continually wants to play catch with a football, even though everyone only stands 6 feet apart.   Denny eventually gets involved with drugs and has to confront the hate-filled Chris-R (and there is no logical reason why the character has a hyphen in his name so don't ask).  Johnny nobly comes out of nowhere to provide Denny salvation, and then this plot point is totally forgotten.The best part of the movie is Mr. Wiseau's acting.  He is leagues ahead of other contemporary actors.  He is on par with DeNiro in Raging Bull, Nicholson in Easy Rider, and Brando in Streetcar.  He delivers his lines as if he IS Johnny, the All-American guy who is trying to stay on the wagon and can't get that promotion at work.  He clearly has been well-trained in Method Acting.  His Croatian-Serbian-Norwegian-Klingon-Mongolian-Yugoslavian accent is barely noticeable when he delivers lines such as `You're tearing me apart, Lisa' and `I treat you like a princess but you stab me in the back.'  You feel Johnny's pain as he becomes a regular MacGyver and hooks up a tape recorder that is able to record for 24 hours straight.  His laugh (ha-ha-ha) comes off as natural as can be.  When you think JOHNNY, you think All-American guy.  The fact that Mr. Wiseau is over sixty years of age and may be on some kind of horse tranquilizer for much of the movie is not an issue.In the trailers for THE ROOM, it is mentioned that Mr. Wiseau's directing and writing evoke Tennessee Williams, and a truer statement has never been made.  You can feel the passion when Johnny transforms himself into Frankenstein and proceeds to destroy his room, moving at a very slow speed. It is as if he is saying to the viewer, `Stella!!' except Mr. Wiseau does not need to say it verbally.  He says it through his emaciated skin which has seen better days and through his jet-black hair which is clearly his natural color.  Even though the Room takes place in San Francisco, it is as if Blanche DuBois is saying to us, `Johnny, you are a real American, because you play football and say ch-ch-chicken.'On the musical front, the shifting from a mysterious moody orchestral score to straight-up R&B ably shows Mr. Wiseau's ability to blend different styles musically in order to create a unified mood in his movie.  On the sound front, the boom operator clearly did an excellent job as half of the lines in the beginning of the movie are dubbed in later, even though the filming takes place in a quiet room with no extraneous noise.With regards to editing, Mr. Wiseau deftly uses cutaways to 30-second-long shots from different vantage points in San Francisco.  He seems to be saying to the viewer, I hope you weren't interested in the dialogue, because now you will have to sit through 30 seconds of the same shot of the Golden Gate Bridge you've seen 10 times already, before we get back to the dramatic tension you were longing for.Other attention to detail includes varying dates on how long Johnny and Lisa have been together (5 or 7 years), the switching from the day shots to night shots and then back to day shots on the same day, the fact that all of the men are dressed in tuxedos and decide to play football even though there is no justification for why they should be dressed in tuxedos, and using the exact same shots in the second love scene between Johnny and Lisa that are also used in the first love scene.Overall, Mr. Wiseau has proven himself to be among the top-rank writers, directors, actors, editors, gaffers, love maker, action stars, and best boys of his generation.  He has shown the ability to take any aspect of filmmaking and transcend it.  He is able to take monkey poop and turn it into a well-polished turd.  I hope to see many more films from Mr. Wiseau in the near future, and I hope that all of them will have Mr. Wiseau acting as well as new and better performances from the guy that played Denny (he rocks!!).  To Mr. Wiseau, I say L'Chaim, and let's drink to much greater Cinema to come!!",

Out of the blue, Lisa is bored of Johnny and begins to have an affair with Mark, Johnny's best friend, which they mention 20 or 30 times.

            "content": "Tommy Wiseau may be a genius somewhere inside of his mind. I would still be interested to see it leap out at us unsuspecting viewers. For now, we have The Room on our hands, one of those real marvels of bad movie-making. It's a hilarious kind of bad movie, where one can see that the actors are trying, for better or worse (no, usually for the worse) to act in a serious capacity in their characters. The Room was written as a play first, and it shows: scenes in rooms, scenes on a rooftop (and what a view, ho-ho), scenes in a field somewhere throwing around a football, and back to the Room again. And now it's being touted by its maker as being a 'comedy'. This is called 'after-the-fact' thinking. It was made as a drama, in all sincerity, and now it's a matter of saving face, it becoming a midnight movie, a riot. It's worth it.Watch it with friends if you can't watch it with a packed audience. It's that kind of bad movie, where one can marvel at how Wiseau managed to eff-up continuity, where actors are supposed to be in a scene, repeating things they just said, saying things that are inconsistent with things said before, characters who disappear for stretches and reappear as if they were just there in the room the whole time. I admire a filmmaker who can do something this wretched, since it shows that somewhere inside of this guy is a voice of an artist. Bad, misguided, and perhaps just untalented. But who is Ed Wood if not an untalented artist who had a lot of ideas and a lack of skills and where-with-all to do it? Oh, and did I mention the film takes place in San Francisco? This point is hammered in so much you expect for Bullitt to roll over the hill at some point and run over one of the kids playing football. I could attempt to go further and describe the plot, but is there any aside from these several words: Johnny (Wiseau) has a fianc\u00e9 he loves, she's cheating on him with his best friend, and neither of them can commit to letting Johnny go. Nothing else happens except many scenes of talking; someone may have mentioned a chamber drama in comparison to The Room, and it's not far off. I imagine Wiseau is a big fan of Ingmar Bergman, specifically Cries & Whispers (red walls, anyone?), and if so, more power to him. That it's often so bad as to be unwatchable, when not crying-buckets-of-tears hysterical in its laughter-quota, should also be noted with that.And one more thing that needs to be said about Tommy boy: he's not a good actor. This is something crucial - he is an easy target for us folks who watch bad movies searching for the next bad actor around the corner. He's so awful not simply because of his lack of emotion in scenes, but how over-emotional he gets when, say, he channels James Dean, or at the end when he (in an act ala Orson Welles in Citizen Kane) tears apart the house at the end. When he enters on the screen it's like an 80's hair-metal cover band is missing its roadie, and he's still in training. He may be inept as a director, and writer, and casting agent, and especially at those sex scenes (good God, someone resurrected BoyZ 2 Men!), but seeing him in the titular lead role is about enough to drive most sensible human beings out of the theater in droves, or shut off the DVD and ask netflix if it was a mistaken delivery.For the rest of us, however painful it can get, The Room is an entertaining debacle, poorly produced and all the funnier for it.",

            "content": "\"The Room\", more aptly titled \"Inconsistancy: The Laughably Pitiful Time Machine\", left me feeling more conflicted than ever before. On the one hand, this is clearly the worst movie ever made.  Tommy Wiseau must be a billionaire, because I have no idea who in their right mind would fund this project.  The acting is horrific, the plot drops its incomprehensible tangents about as abruptly as they are surfaced, half of the film is composed of sex scenes (one recycled, by the way), and the dialogue is the most unnatural I've ever heard... it's a joke.  And speaking of jokes, all these qualities make \"The Room\" one of the most fun films I have seen in a long, long time.  I loved it - it's absolutely destined to be a cult classic.  While watching this adorable attempt at capturing reality, I couldn't help but long for the return of MST 3K so they could have a crack at this thing.  Fortunately, the audience picked up on my vibes and shouted out jokes and comments sufficient enough for my yearning.  I would recommend that every person in the world find a way to see this film because it will leave you feeling that much better about yourself.  I mean that sincerely. So long as you have a great sense of humor and don't mind that the characters' only motivation for action is simply their ill-explained personality traits, I guarantee explosive laughter throughout the surprisingly quick hundred minutes.  It's like nothing I have ever experienced before.  Wiseau's character delivers the line at one point, \"You're tearing me apart!!\"  My sentiments exactly.  10 stars.",

The most important thing here is to realize that there's a time before, and a time after The Room. Everyone who never heard of the Room and watched it, probably simply hated it. Everybody who heared of the Room first and watched it afterwards, might be terribly entertained.The Room is simply about Tommy Wiseau, being his weird excentric self. Wiseau being a living, breathing and walking oddity and trainwreck, gives you a tour through his mindset, his way of thinking and his complete lack of self-awareness.In his incompetence, he put a stamp on cinema forever and has entertained millions of people and will continue to do so. But this has nothing to do with how good or funny his work his, but only by giving birth to the phrase: It's so bad it's good. But it's even too weird for that phrase.Just......watch it and see for yourself. And be happy that you're part of the \"after\" group.",

Title references what is obvious to everyone save for the hero, who is dethroned by his own ignorance. Incompetent filmmaker Tommy Wiseau, who also wrote this travesty, stars as Johnny and he cannot get through a scene without chuckling at nonsense or plainly addressing everyone with the familiar, \"Oh hai (insert name here).\" He writes Johnny as this beloved guy who didn't get the promotion at the bank. He enjoys playing football while wearing a tuxedo, and having the most dreadful sex ever put to film. Juliette Danielle plays Lisa, Johnny's fianc\u00e9 and she is written as a scheming bitch who cannot decide whether Johnny is a great guy or somebody she can destroy. Greg Sestero plays Mark and we are reminded constantly that he is Johnny's \"best friend.\" He and Lisa are having an affair and Johnny has an unlimited cassette recording to prove it. Philip Haldiman plays a creepy kid named Denny who likes to watch Johnny and Lisa have sex as well as being part of a pointless drug related subplot. Carolyn Minnott plays Claudette, Lisa's grouchy mother who apparently has breast cancer. With dreadful writing and sets fit for an amateur play the film becomes a laughable charade celebrating the brilliance of one Tommy Wiseau. Score: 1 / 10",

What I was expecting was \"so bad it's good\". And yes, it is not good, but it is also not so bad that it would really qualify for MST3K. Granted, there are lots of hallmarks of bad film-making - wooden performances, strange reactions, subplots that go into a brick wall, and what is it with that footage of Alcatraz between every scene? This is the story of Johnny (Tommy Wiseau) and his fianc\u00e9e, Lisa, who discovers she is bored with Johnny shortly before their wedding. A cast of characters pop chaotically in and out of the plot, which include Johnny's voyeuristic young ward and Johnny's best friend who winds up sleeping with Lisa, but does at least show his loyalty to Johnny by whining about it before, during, and after. Lisa's mom's performance is certainly one for the books. She casually mentions she has cancer as though she has mentioned a hangnail and then nothing is ever said about it again. Lisa certainly doesn't seem that worried about her mother's impending doom. Maybe her lack of concern is understandable considering her mother is always telling her she needs to stay with Johnny since Lisa doesn't have what it takes to make it in the job market and needs someone to take care of her. This is a mother figure the way Howard Hughes used to write them.This whole film viewing experience leads me to one conclusion - young people today are both spoiled and deprived when it comes to film. They are spoiled in the sense that they think this is the worst film in history just because of the rather cheap sets and oddly constructed storyline. Independent filmmakers that make such films as a rule have been priced out of the market, and all that is widely released today are prepackaged superhero films with special effects to dazzle and scripts that have no impact on the soul. Young people are also deprived since they don't get to see much \"so bad it's good\" film-making either. If you want to see truly bad films that entertain feast your eyes on \"The Killer Shrews\" with dogs suited up in bath mats as the shrews. Also, try any film written by/directed by /starring Ed Wood and see what really bad stream-of-consciousness dialogue and cheap art design are all about.I gave this film five stars because more stars would say it's a good film, which it isn't, and less stars would say it is really bad, possibly to the point of being interesting, and it's not that either. It's mediocre - which means it really is not worth your time.",

There were roses....spoons....and Denny. Tommy Wiseau, possibly the greatest independent,new,director/writer/producer named Tommy to come from Europe in the past year...bar none. Some people have compared him to Tennesse Williams, and I couldn't agree more...his acting is probably the closest I've seen to him since Philip Haldiman. The symbolic usage of spoons in this movie makes me love it even more. The cutaways to the fabulous bridge brings a horrifying yet satisfying theme to this already quirky yet serious yet pornographic movie. I cannot wait to see what movie Tommy decides to do next, personally I don't think he can top this one....but maybe a sequel is in order to this great trilogy or saga of movies to \"The Room\"...possibly Denny spin-offs.

The settings are dull in the lighting and feel very limited and overly-compact, while the cinematography and editing are some of the worst I've seen in a while. The music feels jumpy and doesn't fit with some scenes, while apart from one classic \"I feel like I'm sitting on an atomic bomb waiting for it to go off\" the dialogue is inane and painfully cheesy, the story is thinner than a sewing thread, the direction is one of the most inept directing jobs I've encountered in recent years and the film in its pace is painfully slow in many spots. The acting is also atrocious from everybody involved. Tommy Wiseau is a big reason why The Room is so bad, he shows little talent for writing or directing, while his acting fares even worse as I can't remember a single moment where he didn't make me cringe. All in all, a truly inept film, might have some novelty value, but even that can't hide how appalling The Room is. 1/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "The Room is a romantic drama film written and directed by Tommy Wiseau, staring himself as the character of Johnny. Not too often does a movie reach cult classic status because it is considered be the worst movie of all time. Its terribleness has caught the eyes of millions, including actors James Franco and Seth Rogen, prompting them to produce an autobiography based on the making of this movie called The Disaster Artist. The Room's notoriety is well known on the internet, with memes and quotes littering on YouTube's comment section like \"You're tearing me apart, Lisa,\" \"That's the idea!\" \"Haha, what a story, Mark,\" and the most infamous \"I did not hit her\u0085 Oh hi Mark.\" For being a bad movie, this film is very quotable. I did not get much humor from the memes before seeing the movie, but after braving through it, I can safely say my life has greatly improved being able to detect The Room references everywhere on the net, which might just be the movie's greatest gift to me.This movie is every bit as bad as advertised. From a filmmaking perspective, it breaks so many rules that I would need to write a college dissertation in order to cover everything. First off, the acting is extremely bad, I mean on an atrocious level with everybody from top to bottom giving their career worst efforts. The director, Tommy Wiseau is technically the worst of them all, but because he was just so dreadful, along with his ridiculous appearance and thick eastern European accent, it actually made him charming. The other actors however, were worse than Disney Channel Original Movies.The script is abysmal and character development is non-existent. Everybody in the film does things randomly without rhyme or reasons, and is inconsistent with their objectives and motivation. Lisa, Johnny's girlfriend, cheats on him with his best friend, Mark, citing the reason being the former is \"boring,\" but then in the next scene, Lisa defends Johnny in front of her mother. Mark, the aforementioned friend, constantly states Johnny is his best friend, yet gives in to Lisa's temptations multiple times, each time acting confused on Lisa's advances to lure him in for intercourse. Johnny having found out Lisa is cheating on him, decides to stay with her anyway because she is his \"future wife,\" but then decides to set up a tape recorder to \"record everything\" as a mean to catch her in the act. Why not just break up with her the moment he finds out? How does showing the evidence to anyone else prove anything when he is the only person in the world this information matters to? The writing is complete nonsense.Throwaway subplots and lot of useless scenes are separated by really long stock footage landscape shots of San Francisco. Wiseau used these shots so liberally he would transition from a room to a shot of the Golden Gate Bridge and then back to the same room again with no passage of time. Many scenes in the movie are without purpose, making me wonder if Wiseau had them in the script or he just decided to shoot whatever he felt like that particular day. What is more peculiar being they contain seemingly vital dialogue that one might believe will pertain later on, but alas that is not the case. Filmmaking 101 dictates if you show a gun in act one, be prepare to use it in act three, except Tommy Wiseau did not get that memo.Loads of unintentional funniness drowns the movie, but I honestly only laughed out loud at a few of them. The best thing about the movie is being able to enjoy all the references and memes you would encounter on the internet afterwards. The quality of the film really lends itself to be spoofed and parodied, only because Tommy Wiseau actually thought he made a romantic drama masterpiece. For all of our benefits, the joke is on him.This is a really bad movie that is strangely enjoyable if you choose to go along with its inadvertent humor. I understand how the movie got such a huge following, since it is immensely quotable with lots of infamously iconic moments, but I do not understand how anyone can truly be a \"fan.\" It is one thing to enjoy a movie at an ironic level, but another to become a true fan of a truly awful movie. I do not wish to see this twice, but then again, I would not have to because it will forever be paraded on the internet to remind me of its existence.",

Sure, you can easily sum up the banal, clich\u00e9 plot, or approximate the mind-bogglingly amateurish acting and the hole filled, insanely convoluted, and just plain weird screenplay. You'll make yourself laugh as you quote choice lines (\"Hi Doggy!\" \"I feel like I'm sitting on an atom bomb that's about to explode!\" \"The world would be a better place if everyone loved each other.\" \"Oh hi _______!\" \"Chocolate is the symbol of love.\" \"Cheep cheep cheep!\" et al) and mime Wiseau's hilariously awkward motions and slurred cadences (\"It's not true, I did not hit her! I DID NOOOOT.\"). You'll try in vain to convey the sheer weirdness of the incessant football playing, the hilarity of the jogging at the park, the brilliance of Chris R., the beautiful blue-screened rooftop, the horrific sex scenes that never seem to end, the mantra-like, gut-wrenchingly saccharine pop songs that accompany said sex scenes, and the inescapable, mind-erasing voids of Lisa and Claudette's mother-daughter one-on-one's. However, frustratingly for the would-be promoter of the film, these sorts of descriptions do little in the way of actually capturing the genuine magic that occurs when one sees \"The Room\" for the first time.After hearing about the film on NPR, my interest was peaked. Soon after, I discovered that there were several clips of the film available to view on Youtube. After watching the rooftop conversation between Johnny and Mark, and an excerpt of the tuxedo-clad football game, I was sold. Living over 2000 miles from Los Angeles, I knew my only option was to purchase the DVD, which retails for about $11 on Amazon. Later that week, I found myself staring at Wiseau's curiously droopy face and preparing, at long last, to watch \"The Room.\" Words fail to describe my experience; I was immediately hooked. Now, several months later, I've watched the film close to ten times, and I can say without hyperbole that it has become more fascinating and hilarious with each viewing. If you're reading this and you're on the fence about whether or not to go to a screening, or to spend the $11-$15 for the DVD, fear not \u0096 you will regret nothing. In fact, you'll begin to wonder how you lived for so long without seeing \"The Room.\" Well, what are you waiting for? \"DO YOU UNDERSTAND LIFE??!!\"",

I didn't really know what the movie was about, only that it was supposed to be a legendary bad movie. So of course I was a bit hesitant about actually taking the time to sit down and watch it. But since I had the chance, I decided to do so.And I can say that I have watched it now and can tick it off my watched movies list. In all honesty I can also say that this is not a movie that I will ever be watching a second time.The storyline in \"The Room\" was rather pointless. It was about a guy named Johnny whose girlfriend decides to have an affair with his best friend as she has grown tired of Johnny. And that was essentially the entire storyline wrapped up right there. To compliment this profoundly deep and fulfilling storyline was equally pointless and prolonged love-making scenes which didn't further the story one bit, and the movie would have been just a notch better if they had opted to not include those scenes at all.\"The Room\" has a rather generic and flat character gallery to bring the story to life on the screen. And it didn't really help one bit that most of the cast were doing fairly poor jobs with their given roles and characters; most noticeably writer and director Tommy Wiseau whom also happened to play the lead role himself.The entire movie builds up to a confrontation between Johnny (played by Tommy Wiseau) and his best friend Mark (played by Greg Sestero), and this confrontation climaxes into what has to be one of the most hilarious and horrible fight scenes ever put to film between two men. The scene was intended to be serious and dramatic, but I was laughing so hard that I had tears in my eyes when I saw that, and I actually went back to watch it a second time just for an additional laugh.This epic fight scene then bridges over into a scene where Johnny has an uncontrolled fit of rage and totally ravages his bedroom as his girlfriend leaves him. This scene tops the fight scene in its level of ridiculousness. In fact, it is so bad that it has to be witnessed in order to fully grasp how bad it is.\"The Room\" makes use of some green screen as well, which is quite odd, because it is when they are on the roof of their apartment building, then instead of just filming on top of an actual Apartment Building they opted to go for green screen. And the end result was just atrocious, as the background looks horribly fake and seems more like it was the result of an elementary school student's attempt of fidgeting with green screen.I can agree with my friend's statement that this movie is so bad that it actually has to be seen, because it truly is. \"The Room\" scores a 3 out of 10 stars from me, and I feel rather generous with that rating actually, which is primarily because the movie has an adequate production and editing value to it.",

It's not about quality here (certainly not acting or script, the amount of repetition is suffocating and obnoxious to say the least), but about an experience with others about a really bad movie, that was meant to be a drama. Well I guess it's still a Drama, but not in the conventionnal sense.Tommy is really bad and it seems he has to be dubbed at times. There are quite a few \"What the ...\" moments. Tommys laugh is ... curious? Definitely very unique. There's no real story and there are 3 to 4 sex scenes in the first 20 minutes of the movie. But worry not (or do?), it changes pace from there. But there is nudity applenty, especially Tommys bare behind, and a strange position to have actual intercourse is being revealed too. Or at least a anatomically incorrect penetration spot if you want to call it that. Now that may sound just crazy, but some will find this very amusing.You can obviously watch just Highlights of this, but you will never know how bad it really is, if you don't watch it fully, to get the full experience of things.

That being said I will go on to say that I have figured out what is going on with the horror-fying truth surrounding The Room...or should I say The Coffin of Lies! believe what you want, but this movie was no mistake.  Vampires do exist and his name is Tommy Wiseau.  Come with me now as I take you down a path of some Bullet-Points-of-Truth: 1.  First off, all Wampires LOVE to overdecorate with candles, rose petals and white mosquito netting draped romantically over the bed.  No grown heterosexual man, San Fransisco native or no, decorates like that unless he has death for the innocent on his mind. 2.  SPOON!  Or should I say ancient device for killing blonde booby-licious girls. So dear is this ancient weapon that he has HIS photographed and FRAMED! 3.  The fact that Lisa, who has been around Johnnys Vampire character long enough, has formed telephathic skills powerful enough to make an entire room full of people think that they should all go OUTSIDE in the middle of a party so that she can do a little sucky-sucky of her own (on the ultra-handsome Greggy Sestero!), then using her mind powers moments later to get them all, like cattle, to go back INSIDE when she wants to suck on some cake. 4.  Unexplained Tuxedo scene - Vampires love to overdress and hang out in alleys playing football, or should I say deathball as the poor psychiatrist is lobbed the offending ball and ends up falling down and disappearing from the movie altogether.  Play Psychiatrist with us will you!?5.  Vampires often use their powers to keep people off-kilter and confused. Note Mark always asking \"what are you doing\" and \"whats going on here?\" as well as Lisas inability to put her finger on what exactly it is that she does in \"the computer business\" that is so hard.  Or the fact that Johnny's Vampire character makes himself dizzy at times and tells people about his non-descript \"job in the banking industry\" which he clearly hates because people in the banking industry steal his money making ideas, probably old-fashioned jealousy over that  Ancient European banking industry hair style...long and black my friends, Not too obvious VAMPIRE! 6.  Denny has drug problem, drug dealer Chris-R shows up with gun, threats are made and bad acting ensues, Johnny-Vampire shows up....Chris-R gone from movie forever.  No goodbye, no \"be back tomorrow for my money\", just gone from scene and gone from our minds.  what!  huh?  gotta get me one of them Vampires to deal with my boss and that bitch in accounting who thinks her donuts are so freaking great. 7.  The taking away of deadly breast cancer.  God curses old woman with it, old woman blandly accepts imminent death from it, Vampire takes it away.  Gone and forgotten.  No thanks necessary, I'll shoot myself later for having loved you all too much.Oh theres so much more, but I think you'll make the connections on your own.What does this have to do with Tommy being a Vampire as well?  Honey please, that hair, he always wears black, you can't put a finger on his true age (45-62?) only a vampire could acquire that fright physique and we all know that Vampires like to screw their partners in the lower abdomen...hence the uncomfortable sex scenes where he savagely grinds her torso just below her boob.  Perhaps she has a side-hatch we don't know about but my money is on the first thing.  Look at this film differently from now on you will, black is the force behind the Wiseau.  A bank account large enough to produce your own film to attract fresh life-forces, yes I'm on to you Tommy, and I'll be watching to see if you are secretly sucking the life-force out of the audience next time I go see this film.  Oh yes, I'm definitely going back...it's free!",

            "content": "Room, The (2003) ** (out of 4) This now notorious film will certainly go down in history as one of the most bizarre and at times creepy midnight movie. Johnny (Tommy Wiseau) feels that he has the perfect but soon he's about to learn that his perfect fianc\u00e9 (Juliette Danille) is having an affair with his perfect friend (Greg Sestero). I honestly believe that there's a fine line between genius and madman and that line is perhaps a figure of Wiseau. I've heard so many crazy stories about this film that it's hard to believe that the actual movie is still ten times crazier than anything I had heard. I know the film is going over big on the midnight circuit and it's clear this film has a following unlike anything seen since the 70s but at the same time the film frustrated me because I simply couldn't figure it out. There's certainly no other movie out there to compare this to so on that level this is a highly original film. Should I give it credit for that? On the other hand this thing is so poorly made with all sorts of goofs that you have to wonder if the genius did this on purpose to try and make something original or if he was a madman who simply didn't know he was creating something so stupid. I mean, how else would one explain the incredibly bizarre love scenes that are always shot in slow motion? The first sex scene had me rolling on the floor and it's no doubt one of the greatest in the history of sex. The stupid slow motion is just the start but we even get Tommy sprinkling her with roses and during this scene and future sex scenes it appears that Tommy is humping the girl in every spot except for where it really goes! One of the most frustrating things is that not a single scene matches up. One second you'll have the girlfriend saying she no longer loves Johnny but then the next scene it's as if they're madly in love. You've got the best friend who comes over to see the girl and his dialogue doesn't even match what he's doing or about to do. Just listen to what he says after having sex with her. Continuity errors are running wild and just check out those horrible green screen shots on the roof. How in the hell do you explain the male characters tossing the football around even when they're only a foot apart from one another? How to you explain the girl's mother giving advice for crazy things? How do you explain plot points that come up and then disappear like the scene on the roof where Johnny's \"friend\" has a gun aimed at his head? I'm sure you could watch this thing a million times and none of it would ever make a bit of sense. Do we call THE ROOM one of the worst movies ever made or one of the most brilliantly insane movies ever made? Both PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE and THE ASTRO ZOMBIES are horrible films but why is the Wood film one of the most entertaining movies to watch while the other would lead many people to suicide? THE ROOM is without question one original piece of work and for that there I tip my hat to director-writer-producer Wiseau.",

            "content": "The Room has been called \"the best worst movie\" and \"the Citizen Kane of bad movies\". It is definitely a bad movie, but it doesn't even know it's bad. It goes so over the top with its acting, with Tommy Wiseau to blame mainly. and so thin on progression and depth. It's even a challenge to review since many of the scenes basically plea to be seen rather than to be discussed from a narrative perspective.Tommy Wiseau is the film's error in a nutshell. He is a horrendously poor actor, doesn't know exactly how to recite his lines in a believable, and for that matter convincing, manner, and has this awkward, stiff screen presence. Think of Jean-Claude Van Damme's talentless brother. I've heard from many that when you meet him in person and comment on how bad The Room actually is, he doesn't even know what you're talking about. He is oblivious to the fact that he created one of the most laughably bad dramas in recent history. But also, the most entertaining in the worst possible ways.The story is about Johnny (Wiseau) who is about to be engaged to a gorgeous women named Lisa (Danielle). What Johnny doesn't know is that Lisa's love for him is wearing thin to the point where she resorts to having an affair with Johnny's friend Mark, played surprisingly well by Greg Sestero, who seems like the only person that is trying to give a decent performance. There's also a kid named Denny (Haldiman), Johnny's neighbor whom Lisa and him treat like a real son. I use the term \"kid\" loosely. We don't know how old he is, if he has parents, or what his purpose is at all. At times, he seems like he could be a functioning adult, but at other times he acts like a curious ten year old.The biggest problem, besides some of the most atrocious acting in recent years, is the countless number of continuity errors and abandoned subplots that plague the film like a virus. Not only does Wiseau seem mostly unfocused, but so does the whole script. There is an instance where Lisa's mom is talking with her daughter and brings up that test results prove she has breast cancer. Gee, that's pretty depressing and sad, huh? Would you believe Lisa doesn't even ask a single question afterwards? We have bigger topics to tackle. Like Lisa becoming uninspired and bored with her relationship.Another scene that feels like it was added in during post-production is the scene where Denny has a violent encounter with a drug addict on the roof of their apartment. It's arguably the most interesting and climatic scene in the film, but we fail to garner any specific backstory. Just this rushed, deflated scene, and then it's on to the next anomaly of filmmaking, with this instance never to be mentioned again.This is a cult film in every sense of the term, and the one star rating should not be viewed as a heavy one. I am inclined to review films based on whether or not they are good, and what I believe they rightfully deserve. The Room doesn't deserve a positive rating, but that doesn't mean I didn't personally enjoy it. It's not a good movie, but I had fun watching it and was never bored. I would almost go on to say its viewing is vital for those who are brave enough to hold out for it. Its comedic value is high, yet its quality value is shockingly low. I guess I can say I've never seen a bad movie this good.Starring: Tommy Wiseau, Juliette Danielle, Greg Sestero, Philip Haldiman, Carolyn Minnott, and Robyn Paris. Directed by: Tommy Wiseau.",

            "content": "This romantic drama film written, directed, produced by Tommy Wiseau is a great example of 'it's so bad, it's good'. Some audiences found the bizarre storytelling, entertaining, despite the film's many various technical and narrative flaws. It got so popular, that film screening parties were set up, for fans of the film to have fun throwing plastic spoons at the film, blurting out the film's dialogue, or tossing footballs around. It's really shocking to see how many people would flock to the theaters, just to partake in it. After all, you don't want to watch this alone, it's dull & boring. It will be a mistake. The downer ending doesn't help. However, I do like the shout-outs references to the older 1940s/1950 films. The film tells the story of a melodramatic love triangle between a good-natured banker, named Johnny (Tommy Wiseau), his fianc\u00e9e Lisa (Juliette Danielle), and his conflicted best friend, Mark (Greg Sestero) whom Lisa has secretly been seeing behind Johnny's back. Sadly, this love affair is way drawn-out and its sex scenes are sickening. They don't seem to serve any purpose other than Padding. Worse, according to cast and crew, Tommy had bad body odor issues; because of this, they used clips of the first sex scene in the second sex scene, because the actors refused to do yet another. Against the backdrop of Lisa and Mark's affair, are numerous subplots involving secondary characters that has little to do with the main plot, such as drug deal goes wrong, tuxedos football playing, new characters appearing, mysterious banking clients, house buying deals, people breaking into Johnny's house to have sex, and a character dealing with breast cancer. Each poorly written subplot receives little to no exposition, and none of them are ever resolved, by the end of the film. Despite the title, 'The Room' makes little sense as a title, because characters are neither trapped in a room. According to the director, the title refers to a person's happy Place, but it makes no sense, since the movie is more about betrayal, anger & depression. The poor written script is also badly characterized by the film's numerous inexplicable mood and personality shifts in characters. Characters within the film, do things, way too irrational. It's like, they were all stupid. Also, much of the dialogue is highly repetitive. In addition to being rife with bad dialogue, the film has some of the worst acting, I have ever, witness. They are so bad, that they undermine the script's intention. A good example of this is how Johnny comes off, very creepily & obsessive rather than the model husband & friend. Tommy's weird European accent is awkward, and stale. It's really odd, how he laughs at really random stuff, such as domestic abuse. I guess, it kinda makes sense, since Wiseau intended for the film to contain a subplot in which Johnny was revealed to be a vampire. Thank goodness, that subplot was eventually drop, due to budget cuts. Tommy Wiseau was so bad, at remembering his lines that much of his dialogue had to be re-dubbed in postproduction. Sadly, most of it, wasn't even in sync with his lip movements. Juliette Danielle was alright in the film, but her character was made, way too unlikable. For Greg Sestero, he was pretty much, phoning his acting, in. It's funny to hear stories of him, ad lipping, just to make Wiseau angry. Supporting characters are just as bad; such like Denny (Philip Haldiman). His behavior is incredibly creepy and bizarre. Even the director has admitted the character might be mildly retarded. Other characters like Claudette (Carolyn Minnott), Mike (Scott Holmes) & Peter (Kyle Vogt) come across as pointless. Those actors really did suffer, a lot during production. Minnott got heat stroke, while Vogt got a concussion. Really bad luck, but OK acting, but a bit hammy. There are way, too many supporting characters to keep track of. The budget for The Room went really over budget, reaching $6 million, all of which was spent on production and marketing. Wiseau made numerous poor decisions during filming, such as building sets for sequences that could have been filmed on location, purchasing unnecessary equipment, and filming identical scenes multiple times using different sets. They further claims that the film's budget skyrocketed as a result of scenes taking too long to shoot due to Wiseau's inability to properly handle a camera. It must had been a nightmare to produce this film. You can tell, due to really bad editing. A good example is the flower shop scene, which tries to cram in, everything in 30 seconds. Other scenes that didn't work is the rooftop sequences with the bad CGI. Looks so fake. The music didn't help. It incredibly sounds cheesy like R&B softcore porn. The film marketing is also very bizarre. The film was promoted almost exclusively through a single billboard, featuring an image of Wiseau looking like a horror film, serial killer. I wonder, if The Room is unintentional or perhaps intentional portrayal of the awkwardness and social disconnect that Wiseau experiences in his own everyday life? I think he could never fully grasp what qualifies as normal, social behavior, and the movie is his expression of his own frustrations. It would explain, all the homosexual undertones. Anyways, the movie has a film adaptation of the making of this film in the works & a 3D version. Even a Broadway adaptation is tossed around. As of this writing, none of those, have yet been produced. However, a video game of the same name was produced. Overall: The film had many \"admirers'\" calling it a modern Ed Wood type of a masterpiece, due to sincerely attempt of making a great dramatic picture, and falling miserable. In my eyes, I do somewhat agree. I considers it so bad that \"it truly is one of those movies you have to see to believe.",

It is a film that does everything so fundamentally and blatantly wrong, that it achieves an amazing watchability. This goes up there with \"Troll 2\", \"Plan 9 from Outer Space\" and others as one of the best \"So-bad-it's-good\" films of all time!Written by, directed by, produced by and starring the strange Eurpean man named Tommy Wiseau, \"The Room\" is an attempt to make an edgy, romantic thriller about a man who is pushed to the breaking point by the circumstances of his life.Yeah, and it's pretty awful.My score for the film is what the film deserves based on it's merits- (direction, writing, acting), however, I will say that for a \"fun factor\", this film gets a 10. It's insanely hard not to enjoy something this train-wreck awful.Wiseau plays \"Johnny\", a bank employee who lives in a nice neighborhood in San Francisco with his fianc\u00e9e Lisa. His best friend is Mark (played by Greg Sestro), and we are reminded that they are best friends about 50 times throughout the film by the wonky dialog. Also living in the building is Denny, who Johnny has more-or-less adopted. Denny is a strange character. He is meant to be an innocent, silly young college student, but the performance and writing turn him into a strange, creepy man who comes off as more of a total sleeze than a good guy. However, when Johnny's girlfriend Lisa begins to cheat on Johnny with Mark, things quickly spiral out of control.That's all I want to give away for this film. But trust me when I say it's a blast to watch!The film is strangely quotable. The abysmal dialog is almost poetic in it's nonsensical-ness. The direction is flat and uninspired, and quite humorous. The acting is hilarious (Wiseau's strange accent and ho-hum attitude makes his character sound like a zombie), and the cinematography is cheap.It really is a textbook example of how not to make a film.Which is where all of the hilarity comes from. This is the sort of movie you pop on while drinking beer with some friends, and meticulously pick apart piece by piece. There is nothing that this film does right, and the chuckles and laughs you will get out of it's incompetence start right away.I love this movie.

From actors struggling to convey basic human emotions, to awkward, frequent and drawn out \"love\" scenes, to the god awful blue screen jobs and strange and convenient characters (seriously? \"Chris R\"? Really rolls off the tongue doesn't it?), The Room will shock and awe. Even the editing is top notch {insert random shot of San Fransisco here}. The Room even manages to not make sense from line to line! This has seriously become one of my favorite movies.If you haven't seen it, you're missing out.",

The Rooms stellar dialog kept me at the edge of my seat as I constantly wanted to see what was going to happen next, also all of the actors were so brilliant that I literally felt I was part of the film. I felt angry when Tommy Wiseau was mad and I cried when he was depressed. This masterful piece of artwork was definitely throughly thought out, especially the biography on Steve. Then when this Epic piece ended I stood up and cheered knowing that I just watched a good movie and a single tear appeared from my eye and rolled down from my cheek as I was in awe.

            "content": "When it comes to films like 'Sharknado' (2012) most people would say 'It's bad but good', though I don't agree on the example as I hate films that are forced to be bad rather then doing it naturally and this is an example of it. I will admit, the writing is bad, the characters are bad, the acting is bad and the filming is bad. Tommy Wiseu is just one of the worst actors I've seen. He doesn't put too much emotion towards it, even his temper tantrum scene is just hilariously bad when he's really trying to be acting but never succeed in such progress. The story is bad, some scenes like the girlfriend talking to her mother is repetitive as it's the same conversation over and over again about her not loving 'Johnny' (Tommy Wiseu) and the Breast Cancer scene doesn't bring much of a dramatic effect, it's just like 'I have breast cancer big whoop(!)' But I think the worst scene was when they found the main character's dead body on the ground after putting a bullet to his mouth and one character says 'Wake up Johnny' while GF says '\u0085is he dead?' OK when it comes to a person lying down on the ground with blood smeared everywhere on the floor and probably his bowels voided too, it shows that yes he is dead even a person with half a brain would know he's dead the first second they see the body. As I heard Wiseu says that the film WAS intentionally bad, it doesn't feel intentional at all. It feels like a film that is trying so so so so so hard at being a drama that it fails miserably. But it is hilariously bad.",

            "review_title": "The funniest worst, and therefore one of the greatest movies ever made.",
            "content": "Last night, I engaged in a long conversation with my brothers girlfriend. Although my memory is unclear due to the hammering effects of drinking three cocktails, there is one thing I still remember. She declared Legally Blonde as \"the worst movie ever.\"Having seen LegalIy Blonde, I challenged her by reminding her that she had not seen The Room, although she had endured the Nostalgia Critics infamous review of it. While both films are bad, there is a distinguishing difference between a bad film like Legally Blonde and a bad film like The Room. You see, Legally Blonde is bad because like many mainstream films, it has shallow characters. The Room is bad because it fails on every conceivable level that a film can fail which is why it has been dubbed by some academics and as \"the Citizen Kane of bad movies\". Because Citizen Kane is often cited as \"the greatest movie ever made\", The Room is therefore \"the worst movie ever made\" even if the title that has long been held by Plan 9 From Outer Space for well over thirty years. However as bad as The Room is, it delivers unintentional laughs in bucket loads. Go onto Youtube and look up \"Hi doggy/Flower shop scene.\" If you aren't amused by the obvious scripting and editing errors, not to mention the downright bizarre mis en scene, then clearly there must be something wrong with you. The Room is the story of Johnny (played by writer/ director, Tommy Wiseau), a banker who is about marry his longtime fianc\u00e9, Lisa (Juliette Danielle) . After an unnecessarily long and detailed love scene that is briefly interrupted by the perverted Denny who just likes to watch. Lisa figures she is bored of Johnny, and decides to invite his friend Mark (Greg Sestero) over so she can have a talk that involves having sex on a spiral staircase. Drama inevitably ensures, through several convoluted plot points that are instantly dropped before everything climaxes in true Shakespearean style.One of the great features of The Room is how amazingly repetitive the dialogue is. Every time a character enters a set, they are always greeted with lines like \"oh hi Mark\", \"oh hi Denny\" , \"oh hi doggy\". The \"oh hi\" phrase is repeated so often, it's almost as if Tommy thought they were necessary to remind us that the scene has now changed. But that's not the only thing he reminds us about. Every time Lisa seduces Mark, he always declares \"Johnny is my best friend\". At several points in the film, Lisa's mother ,Claudette comes in to remind us that by cheating on her fianc\u00e9, Lisa is going to suffer deep financial troubles. If you want see what plot driven dialogue looks like in its most unsubtle, non character driven form, look no further.The character interactions are also monotonous. In the films first half hour, we see three sex scenes that are ridiculously gratuitous to the point of nearly being soft core. The only way for Johnny to hang out with his friends is to play football. Johnny laughs even if friends tell him something that wasn't meant to be funny or ironic. The limited character interactions are not helped by the acting either. Never before seeing the famous \"I did NUHT\" moment, had I ever seen acting that was so detached and void of any convincing emotion that replacing the actors with Hayden Christiansen or even the HAL 9000 computer could actually mark an improvement. And yet, because of its sheer level of badness combined with Wiseau's love of film, The Room represents a rare feat in cinema. Its success is the kind that many would be directors have wished for. Yes it's a bad amateur film by a clueless first time director . But like many of the best films like Quentin Tarrantino's Pulp Fiction, or Monty Python and The Holy Grail, it delivers scene after unforgettable scene with schizophrenic writing that's hilarious enough to deliver the kind of joy that could finally give Super Mario an erection after twenty five years of sexless marriage.The Room came out in 2003, the same year that gave us hits like The Matrix sequels, Bruce Almighty, Terminator 3 and Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle which all made millions at the box office. But none of those films are likely to be quoted five years from now. By contrast The Room is much worse than those films and vanished into thin air upon release. It has since attracted an ever growing cult with some fans who were dedicated enough to faithfully adapt it into a video game.Yes, the films I've listed are bad. But they do not have the passion that The Room has to reach for a high level artistic greatness. And because the film aims so high, it fails so hard. Because it fails so hard, it is without doubt the worst film ever made. But because the film often aims so high and fails so hard, it is without doubt one of the funniest and therefore greatest films ever made. Wiseau did not make the masterpiece he wanted to make, but he still made one. I think that's enough to satisfy any director. For: \u0095 Extremely funny in the most unintentional ways.Against \u0095Technically speaking its horrendous.Rating 10 out of 10",

The Room has been called the Citizen Kane of bad movies and even if Citizen Kane might not be the greatest movie ever The Room is most certainly the worst movie ever made.The Room is filled with so many funny details that it is almost impossible to list them. Each viewing will make it funnier because you get to know the characters and know when things will be funny so you can focus on other new terribly funny parts. I haven't laughed this much while watching Some Like it Hot , Sienfeld and others.The Room is essentialy a very poorly made drama in all aspects. The actors deliver dialogues in a terribly dead pan manner. It can be the worst of news or the best of news the expressions will remain the same and the delivery be flat. The dialogues are hilarious. The situations are even funnier. Situations are introduced but then put away in an instant as if they were never happening. Fights begin and end within seconds and things go back to normal. The movie is filled with numerous sex scenes that go endlessly and mostly have the same kind of shots. The lead actor played by the actor \u2013 director Tommy Wisseau keeps laughing in his weird manner which alone gives the money the cult quality.During advertising Wisseau compared the film to a good Tenesse Williams drama. Later, he went on to say that he intentionally made a comedy. I don't what is true and even though it is more likely that he made a terrible movie I am glad he did. This generation's Ed Wood has arrived on the scene. Time for all midnight movie fans to rejoice.",

            "content": "\"The Room\" is a film that must be seen. Usually, when a movie deserves one star, it's not worth wasting your time watching. This movie, on the other hand, must be seen . . . in order to be believed.A more appropriate title for this film should be \"Murphy's Film\", because everything that could possibly go wrong with a movie did go wrong with this one. I suppose a light didn't fall on a cast member while filming, but that's not a compliment to give to any film.\"The Room\" could be the worst film ever made for a variety of reasons that feels like a grocery list. The story feels ripped from the most basic soap opera, there are subplots that are out of place and go nowhere, the dialogue is terrible, the actors in the film either underact or overact, there are too many shots that are out of focus, there are unnecessary sex scenes that drag the pace of the story . . . I could go on.As a matter of fact, the basic plot of \"The Room\" can be described in one sentence, whereas all the things that are wrong with the film can fill a book. It should be shown in film school to show students how NOT to make a movie.Tommy Wiseau, a man of unknown origin whose accent sounds Austrian (I guess), starred in, co-produced, directed, and wrote this film on a $6 million budget. He shot it using a 35 mm camera and an HD digital camera simultaneously, reportedly not knowing the difference between the two.Also alleged is his financing for the film, which Wiseau claims he did by taking leather jackets he mysteriously acquired from North Korea and selling them for a profit. That explanation seems more plausible than actually convincing someone to put money down to finance a script already so weak.What results is a film that is just a mess in virtually every aspect. The main story, should you care, involves ad executive Johnny (Tommy Wiseau) and his frustrations with his fianc\u00e9 Lisa (Juliette Danielle). Johnny is oblivious to her having an affair with Johnny's best friend Mark (Greg Sustero), but notices how distant she has become. Wiseau even goes as far as to vent his frustration by channeling James Dean when he shouts, \"You are tearing me apart, Lisa!\".The subplots that go nowhere include a creepy college student named Denny (Philip Haldiman) who likes to watch Johnny and Lisa have sex (and actually tells them so!), Denny's borrowing money from a drug dealer which he can't pay back, Lisa's mother Claudette (Carolyn Minnott) revealing she has breast cancer, and a pointless game of football in tuxedos. These scenes come and go so often, that you wonder why they were there in the first place.Why, then, am I recommending the film? I went to a midnight showing of it at the Coolidge Corner Theater in Brookline, Massachusetts, and had the time of my life. Similar to watching a midnight showing of \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\", fans brought plastic spoons and footballs to throw around during crucial parts of the screening, and shouted out responses to the dense dialogue like it was \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\" times 1000.The film is available on DVD, but like many films famous for their midnight showings, including \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\", \"The Room\" has to be seen in one of these public screenings. It is no fun sitting at home alone watching a film like this one.I hate using the hackneyed phrase \"It's so bad, it's good\" for that reason: it's so overused. I won't give \"The Room\" credit for being good, because it's not. It's just very fun to watch, and I urge whoever reads this to find a movie theater that screens midnight showings in the nearest city and get tickets for this film if you can. It is terrible, but so worth checking out.",

Given, that by some accounts the movie brought in $30M in revenue, the experiment was a success. You can sell anything! I am wondering that nobody is curious enough to investigate Tommy Wiseau (privately of course). To find out some basic things like how old is he, where is he from and the source of his fortune.

Contributors here are generous souls.Reading audience and critical reaction about \"The Room\" is more entertaining than watching its 99 minutes of jaw-dropping, mind-melting celluloid lunacy. Although, I must warn you, \"The Room\" can be addictive (for all the wrong reasons).I'm interested in both film-making and writing, so Tommy Wiseau's disasterpiece plays out like a kind of crazy text book on \"How Not To Make A Movie\" - But as an advert for Independent Film Making it feels similar to selling tickets for the Titanic.The serious point here is that Independent Films are so important for the industry. And, its with independent productions that new talent in all areas of Entertainment can shine and even prosper. Tommy Wiseau is a far better business man than he is an actor/director/writer. His genius lay in raising $2 million dollars to fund this self-indulgent, grandiose folly. If you're going to rip up the rule book on movie-making, at least care enough about your audience to make something worth watching. The Room does not feel like a black comedy. The treatment of women (the central female character is both unscrupulous and amoral) and theme of sexual betrayal explored in the script are just not comedic. Almost by accident, Tommy shows us how vacuous modern life and relationships can be.Top Reviewer Comments:Linkara: \"It sucks out your mind and replaces it with stupid!\"Scott Foundas- Variety Magazine: The film prompted \"most of its viewers to ask for their money back... Before 30 minutes had passed!\"Nostalgia Critic: \"You can basically make trading cards out of how many pointless sequences there are in this movie!\"Questions About The Room:Why is the director obsessed with San Francisco and its trams? Did any of the cast read the script before signing up to the production? If the film was edited, was the editor asleep, fired or did Tommy do the editing too? Did Tommy mean to direct the fight and romantic scenes in such a way as to make them as awkward and wooden as possible?",

            "review_title": "Prepare yourself for the madness of ... \"The Room\"",
            "content": "\"The Room,\" as I write this review, has already achieved cult status. It gets lovingly heckled at midnight shows and mastermind Tommy Wiseau is saying this is what he intended all along.Of course, most of us know better.Upon watching it, anyone can see that \"The Room\" was intended to be a serious Shakespearean-style drama.But somehow, it went horribly wrong.I guess I'll start with the multi-hyphenate lead character of this farce, Johnny, played by Tommy Wiseau, since he wrote, starred in, and directed this. His acting and delivery is just surreal. In some scenes, he is extremely sedate while in others he devours entire set pieces whole. His speech patterns are even more bizarre. He delivers most of his lines as though he's a malfunctioning robot, putting emphasis on the wrong words and the wrong syllables and slurring to the point of incomprehensibility, all with a indescribable thick accent that makes Arnold Schwarzenegger seem coherent by comparison. The irony of all this though is that the movie would be largely forgettable without him.We move on to the next big problem: the dialogue. The problem with it is that it's extremely vague, repetitive, and unnatural. It comes off as adult conversation as imagined in the mind of a 7-year-old. Johnny works in a bank and Lisa works in the \"computer business,\" but no specifics are given as to what they actually do. Characters constantly announce that they're busy while doing nothing, that is when they aren't repeating themselves. Halfway through the movie, you will know that Lisa is beautiful but can't support herself, Mark is Johnny's best friend, and Johnny is a nice guy because the characters constantly remind you. Johnny's supposed nice guy status is especially hard to swallow considering his creepy appearance and demeanor.Conversations are rather schizophrenic and have no natural flow to them. Lisa's mother's revelation that she has cancer is promptly dismissed with \"Don't worry about it\" and never brought up again. Same goes for Denny's drug problems in perhaps the weirdest scene in the whole film. Denny begins by announcing to his dealer that the money will be delivered (by whom?) followed by Lisa and her mother tag-teaming him with dumb questions and hammy acting (\"What kind of money?\", \"Where'd you meet a man like that?\"), culminating in the announcement that the drug pusher has somehow been arrested. Then there are the scenes where Johnny abruptly switches from discussing work to probing about Mark's sex life and the scatterbrained dialogue of the flower shop scene delivered at rapid-fire pace. Mark, not to be outdone, constantly stands there like an idiot asking Lisa what she's up to every time she seduces him. Johnny also has a pathological need to compulsively greet everyone he crosses paths with and laughs spontaneously, often for no reason.The characters not only talk like idiots, they behave like them too. Characters announce that they're leaving despite the fact that they just arrived five seconds ago. They show up unannounced to have sex on Johnny's couch. They spontaneously break out into games of extremely close-contact football. A character suddenly berates Lisa for cheating even though we've never seen him before and have no idea who he is. Lisa decides to discuss her affair with her mother and later arrange a booty call with Mark, both times with Johnny in earshot. As if that weren't enough she tries too hook up with Mark in the middle of Johnny's birthday party... in the living room! However, the standout examples are Denny's declaration that he wants to watch Lisa and Johnny have sex and their subsequent dismissal of it and Johnny's Godzilla-like tirade just before he kills himself.The pacing is noticeably poor. The film is constantly interrupted with shots of random San Francisco landmarks not only as a reminder of where the film takes place but also to show the passage of time. The party scene alone must have at least four of these despite it occurring in a single night, and only a few of them overall are even related to the film's main setting. We must watch two customers order coffee before the main characters do. The most blatant examples of bad pacing by far is the unnecessary impromptu tuxedo football game and the numerous long, drawn out sex scenes set to 4-minute crappy R&B songs played out in their entirety and are anything but sexy. Watching them makes me wonder if Tommy Wiseau has ever even had sex as he seems intent on humping Lisa's bellybutton and her left breast. I guess that's why they decided to add moaning and kissing noises to these scenes: to clear any confusion. Three of them occur within the first twenty-five minutes alone.And finally, we have the sets. With the exception of a few San Francisco exterior scenes, they're all laughably cheap. The living room is probably the best looking even though their TV is actually behind them and there's a door that leads to nowhere. The upstairs bedroom has a banister that wobbles and the stairs don't seem to match the lower floor. The alleyway walls have a painted-on brick pattern as does the rooftop, which deserves its own special mention because of the obvious green-screen backdrop and stairwell that, as near as I can tell, veers off the edge of the building.\"The Room\" will certainly leave you with many questions.How did Tommy Wiseau raise 6 million dollars for this thing? Why is it called \"The Room?\" What is wrong with Lisa's neck? Regardless, the fact that Tommy Wiseau got this thing made is something that this reviewer finds truly awe-inspiring.",

After watching the first few scenes of this film, my head was already shaking so much my neck started to hurt. At the same time it was impossible for me not to crack a smile. This film has the best worst acting I've ever witnessed. The star/director/producer/writer Tommy Wiseau should be in the Hall of Fame of bad acting if there ever was one. I'd describe him as a cross between Christopher Walken and Fabio, except he makes Fabio look like Daniel Day Lewis when it comes to his acting skills. It's not just Tommy who lacks in the acting department. Every single actor/actress in this film will make you want to cringe with every line. It doesn't help the already dreadful actors that the dialogue is absolutely atrocious.When it comes to plot in this movie, there are so many holes it's like Swiss cheese. I would try and explain the plot but there is barely one to begin with. I lost count on how many scenes that were in this movie that were absolutely pointless to the plot. If you are just starting to watch some of the worst films ever created there might not be a better place to start than the Room.

That feeling is the feeling that you feel while you're watching The Room. At least if you're stupid enough to watch it sober, like I did.I had gotten the impression that The Room was about a non-actor who tries to act and fails spectacularly. But The Room is actually about a non-human who tries to pass himself off as one of us and doesn't fool anyone. There are plenty of movies with actors who can't act in them. But with the rest of them, you figure that when they're not in front of the camera, they can probably order a burrito without needing some kind of Star Trek universal translator device. If you manage to sit through even a few seconds of the interview with Tommy Wiseau in the Special Features, you'll soon realize that, when he's acting in The Room, he's actually at the peak of his ability to communicate articulately. His incomprehensible 'Schwarzenegger in Hercules in New York' grunting and bellowing is Tommy Wiseau with a crew of 40 professionals backing him up.And remember when using your microwave oven --- SAFETY FIRST!",

This film apparently one some sort of award, I am guessing that the people who gave this film the award thought this was a comedy as hearing the main characters awful accent with him saying, \"Oh hi, doggy\" would lead me to the same conclusion. That being said, I did feel a bit sorry for the main character as Lisa was pretty much a horrible person and quite frankly the dating scene is just full of Lisa's these days.The story, guy is going to marry his fiance soon. However, she is bored so she starts a fling with the guy's best friend. Her mother is also found to have breast cancer which she reacts to in a very matter of fact way while the boys play football on a roof and Denny has been buying drugs to sell, while the best friend literally acts clueless every time Lisa, the fiance seduces him and Johnny likes to buy flowers and no Johnny! Put the gun down!The film is just crazy and it has so many problems such as a moment at a party when it seems you see the exact same scene play out twice with differing results. Seems Johnny and Mark are going to come to blows, but shake and then Johnny and Lisa are going to go outside to talk things out. Then it seems to rewind (not on purpose mind you) and Mark and Lisa are flagrantly making out and Mark and Johnny come to blows. I am like, \"was there something I missed?\"So, it was bad, but enjoyable in a strange way. I totally felt for Johnny as he was unattractive and looked strange, but no one deserves the treatment he got from Lisa. Just starting stuff because she was bored and playing both sides for her amusement. So many women like her these days acting like they are some rare commodity or something. They literally outnumber men in this country, but get a big head because some guys will have sex with anything. So kudos to Lisa for being the worst person in the film! I think that drug dealer was a more likable character!",

            "content": "Where do I begin, because I have come to realize there are no words in any language that are fit enough to describe the travesty that is The Room. Horrific, dull, mediocre, amateurish, ridiculous, apathetic, all these words come to mind but fail to aptly describe the disaster that this film is so popular for being. And make no mistake, the reason behind this cataclysmic horror show strongly stems from the undeniable and lethal contribution of the lead actor- who so magically also happens to be the director, writer and producer of the film- Mr. Tommy Wiseau. All along throughout the movie I have relentlessly tried to unveil the mystery behind his being so astronomically awkward and overly inhuman, but to no avail. The way he talked, walked, laughed and his overall demeanor seemed out of this world.My only question is how can one appear so profoundly mentally unstable, and originate from an advanced extraterrestrial civilization at the same time? Because that's what Wiseau is to me, an alien. Not to be too negative about his performance though because he genuinely tried his best to act human, although he failed beyond analogy. My conscience will never be able to digest this impostor of a film, because its eccentricity is too solid to be broken down into smaller matter for mental digestion. A film which, at best, conjures an Ed-woodian vision albeit utopical, and instigates psychosomatic self-harm in the viewer. This is without a shroud of doubt the fourth worst movie ever made. Ever. Its preceding contenders being Plan 9 from Outer Space, Troll 2 and Birdemic: Shock and Terror in their respective descending order. Normally when I write a review I will start off by giving a brief note on the storyline but this time I didn't because, well, there is no storyline. The only thing harder to believe than the awfulness of The Room is its mind boggling self-financed budget, a good $1 million, half of which was doubtlessly spent on promoting it and shooting countless takes of the same scene because Tommy Wiseau had a hard time remembering the incomprehensible lines he wrote himself. I read somewhere mind you, that Wiseau had originally included a subplot which would reveal that Johnny, his character, is actually a vampire.I'll let that sink in.There is a plethora of mysteries in the world and third of them are embedded in The Room. Things remain unexplained like irrelevant scenes that contribute nothing to the development of the plot; scenes like when age decrepit Denny, out of place Mark and some bi-dimensional random character (probably played by a spare crew member with about as much acting experience as an Egyptian Pharaoh) are tossing a football around and when the guy spontaneously trips and falls softly apparently breaking a few vertebrae, they all decide to go back inside the house with no indication what impact it has on the story. Or should I talk about the sudden inexplicable mood swings that the characters seem to be experiencing, like when Johnny is apparently in rage and goes to the rooftop cursing and arguing with himself over his girlfriend who's claiming domestic abuse, only to find his friend Mark there and say, in a an oddly quite cheerful manner \"Oh Hi Mark,\"Did I mention The Room has more continuity than CCTV footage? Tommy Wiseau's delusory attempt at cinema is nothing like his counterpart James Nguyen's with Birdemic: Shock and Terror. Nguyen at least steered his supernatural crapfest with stark albeit dubious earnest. Wiseau on the hand assembled his cinematic tour-de-force with resonating apathy, shoulder-shrug level determination and an impetuous attitude that echoes throughout his masterpiece. I could sit here and go through this film illustrating flaw, ineptitude and shortcoming but my time is far too precious to be spent on a preschool film project that is but utter conversion of garbage material into filmstrip. I haven't the slightest idea what message this film was trying to put out there, but it did give a faint hint on love, romance and the ups and downs of relationships (or the Tommy Wiseau's twisted personal view on these subjects) which will only be perceived by the keen-eyed and the one who manages not to fall asleep or commit suicide before the end credits.\"It's not true, I did not hit her, she's lying I did not hit her I did naat.\"I was mentally tortured to sit through 100 minutes of unprecedented depiction of human interaction, the exacerbating diction of Tommy Wiseau's character (not forgetting Wiseau's unidentifiable accent that could only suggest brain damage inflicted speech impediment) and his own ethereal demeanor. All the aforementioned traits merely being characteristic of the actor's own psyche by the way. Thanks dear producers, that is Tommy Wiseau, Tommy Wiseau and Tommy Wiseau. \"You're tearing me apart Lisa!\" Actually you have to witness the way he delivers this particular line to believe it. You have to. You've never seen anything like it before.This entire film looks like a bunch of Martian green men trying to re-enact human behavior in not-so everyday situations, needless to illustrate the results.The Room is an insult and a great crime committed to celluloid, while Mr. Wiseau and his team are gargantuan degenerates of biblical proportions.P.S everyone on the planet should see the final scene where Johnny is on a self-destructive rampage. As Cartman would put it, 'I broke a funny fuse.'",

As every character changes and develops throughout the course of the story, so to does your consciousness evolve as its warring factions are reconciled into a rapture of blissful harmony and understanding. This film has helped me in ways I have only just begun to understand, and it is a sure must-view. Mere moments after this majestic work had concluded, I felt my ignorant, close-minded sense of self fading into the void, and my soul filled with visions of His masterpiece. I am one, not just with this universe, but with all others. Earthly trappings matter not to me now, as I care only to spread His word and to forever carry out His will in whatever way this sniveling mortal form that my higher self clings to can manage. This movie as an integral part of the human experience, as it will be what ends the human experience. We must shed the limits of self and flesh if we are truly to fully understand His teachings, for now we are weak and blind, unable to comprehend the meanings of His messages. Only the soul, untrained though it is, has the potential to understand the utter beauty of the Room. I hope you will join me in shedding the weaknesses of being and ascend into a higher plane of existence, so we may one day call Him from beyond the curtain.

Lisa by the way is an average looking chubby woman that in the Room's universe is hotter than Megan Fox. Mark is a model looking man that will not hesitate throwing you off the roof and apologize some seconds later. There's also Denny a neighbor/son/retarded weirdo that likes to watch people having sex. There's also Claudette, Lisa's mother who's dying of breast cancer. Other characters you ask? Well we have Chris R. who sells drugs to kids before getting paid, Mike and Michelle, two chocolate lovers (I mean that literally), Peter a psychologist who transforms into Steven and a dog that looks like a frog. Confused? Don't be. Everything makes sense in Tommy's mind.What make the Room superior to all of the 'so bad it's good' films is the fact that it's (like the trailer said) a riot. You see unlike other films that have 1-2 unintentionally funny scenes and the rest is a bore the Room is a non-stop extravaganza. Literally every scene has something wrong. Every scene has one quote that will stay in your mind forever. Because I forgot to mention that The Room is also the most quotable film of all time. The Godfather? Pulp Fiction? Star Wars?

I'd like to give it 10/10, but, unless you have at least a small understanding of the history of this film, you may be mistaken for saying that it's possibly one of the greatest movies every made, up there with 'The Godfather' and 'Empire Strikes Back.' I can assure you it's not anything like those films. In fact, although I'd still give it top marks, it should be noted that 'The Room' is only top of its own league in some alternate universe.If you've ever watched a film that, deep down, you know isn't actually good - and yet you've taken a fair amount of enjoyment from it anyway, then chances are you occasionally treat yourself to a 'so-bad-it's-good' sort of movie. If you have then you may get something out of this.I would tell you the story, only there isn't really much of one. At best it's a romantic drama about a couple - one of which is having an affair with her future husband's best friend. It all sounds pretty standard stuff for a drama, but it is one film that has to be seen to be believed.It's awful.I literally cannot think of any positive thing to say about it. And yet I loved it. It truly is a carcrash that, if it hooks you, you will be completely unable to look away from. The acting - awful. The sets - bizarrely awful (check out the last scene where the spiral staircase has been boarded up and yet characters are still supposed to be going up and down it). The dialogue - cringeworthy. And the sheer randomness of scenes that don't go anywhere, coupled with new characters who just sort of pop up and then disappear again with no real explanation, all leaves you with more than a few question marks above your head.The irony being that writer/director and (believe it or not!) 'actor' Tommy Wiseau actually thought he was creating something brilliant. However, only after 'The Room's' release did it dawn on him that people were mocking the film as it appeared to top more than a few 'Worst Film Ever' lists.Now 'The Room' is more infamous than famous. It even spawned it's own dramatic 'making of' movie - the excellent - 'Disaster Artist.' If you're into films then you should at least be aware of this film and the tales of how it came about. If you like your 'so-bad-they're-good' films then you'll probably stick with this one. It certainly will leave an impression with you - whether that's a positive or negative will be up to you.",

We've both watched it multiple times and we're both not satisfied. You thought the scene changes in Memento where confusing? Try The Room. You find yourself always wondering what the heck is going on. That's especially true when the actors are talking. Who wrote this stuff? Tommy Wiseau is who wrote this, youngin'. Get to know him. Seriously. Wiseau not only made this movie, he MAKES this movie. Without Wiseau, you'd be wondering what the hell you're wasting your time for. With Wiseau, somehow the movie makes perfect sense, in a not making sense at all sort of way. Why is he always laughing? Is he nervous on the set? Is this the character of Johnny coming through? Who knows. This is why this movie is so great, it leaves you with so many questions. For instance, in the drunk scene, you find yourself bewildered as to the reason Lisa and Johnny choose to drink what could only be described as Vodka over Whiskey. And then Johnny confirms that the drink \"Isss goood\". How is that possible? You were confused by the time lapses in Primer? You ain't seen nothing. The Room not only has time issues, but it has missing scenes and sudden changes of behavior by the characters. A simple filler shot of San Francisco (Whenever you see Alcatraz, I recommend shouting ALCATRAZ!!!!!) can mean anything from, \"Well, it appears an entire day has passed\"... to \"Well, I think it's the same day\"... or \"Why did I just see that?\".So anyways, here's my final take, starting with the negatives:-The Room suffers from too many sex scenes. The first one is hilarious and disgusting (Does anyone know what's up with Wiseau's body?). After that, the sex scenes are boring, but still disgusting. The only good part is the original music, which is hilarious and addicting. -The Room also suffers from too many Claudette/Lisa scenes. These are really boring and the conversation is always the same... i.e. Lisa complaining about her relationship with Johnny. -Peter is a lame character.And then the positives:-Any scenes with the following characters are stellar: Johnny (Of course). Denny. Chris R (They tease us with only one scene with Chris R). Doggy (Again, a one scene tease). Mike (Watch his face). -This movie is highly quotable. There are too many great quotes to even mention.-The message of the movie \"How can you ever really trust anyone?\".That's about it. Do yourself a favor and watch The Room. I only wish I lived near LA so I could attend a screening and meet Tommy or some of the cast.",

Writer/ Actor / Director Tommy Wiseau was trying to make a dramatic character piece I believe. It is an utter disaster. The best actor in the film is the 2 minute appearance of the drug dealer who merely has to play 'Angry'. It is a no star film, but a 10 star comedy; not by script, purely by the poor production.I am not one for spoilers, but there is a scene when the men all show up in tuxedos to the apartment. The story does not explain why the occasion for tuxedos, or the two strange fellows who are now on camera you have never met before. I digress\u0085They all go outside and play catch with a football in tuxedos!!! Conveniently standing exactly three feet apart from one another. Why??? That is just a snippet of what you have to look forward to when viewing 'The Room' for the first time.

Wiseau, who speaks English with a heavy European accent, plays a thoroughly nice and possibly retarded man who is about to marry his longtime girlfriend, Lisa. Unfortunately, Lisa is cheating on him with his best friend Mark. That's pretty much the entire plot of the movie. For 99 minutes, Wiseau stumbles around saying, \"Oh hai!\" to everyone he comes into contact with. Whenever he leaves Mark and Lisa alone in a room together, they start screwing. Their friends and relatives keep trying to convince Lisa to break it off with him, though none of them are good enough friends to just outright tell poor Wiseau. A couple of subplots get introduced, like Lisa's mother's cancer or Wiseau's young prot\u00e9g\u00e9's dealings with drugs, but they get dropped because the affair is just so damned interesting. The movie's sort of interesting psychologically, though pretty simplistic: Wiseau obviously based the script on his own insecurities (whether a woman ever cheated on him or not), and the film basically contemplates why he either can't get or can't keep a chick. Look up the funny moments on Youtube, but leave the actual film for the braver viewers amongst us.",

Lisa, however, is bored with Johnny and is interested in his best friend. Lisa's mother and friends want her to stay with Johnny for financial security, or at least be honest with him. Lisa instead keeps stringing him along until things come to a head at Johnny's birthday party. After Lisa tells him she's leaving, Johnny shoots himself in the head and we fade out with everyone crying over his body. Much of the unintentional humor comes from the ridiculous dialog, which is sorely repetitive. Tommy Wiseau has a bizarre accent that makes every line he speaks sound like one of the Saturday Night Live comedians doing a Schwarzenegger parody. The whole thing is just so odd and silly, it feels like someone translated the story from a foreign language. Watch it with the Rifftrax commentary--they do a good job with this one.",

Now that is the core movie except that there many many sub plots added like the \"I got cancer\" and the \"Don't take drugs\" .. yeah..oh those plots are from other characters. So you have three main characters and a whole lots of others. Yet the others add allot of little not going anywhere plots to it.It is an experience to see a movie like this, the actors oh my god. The Acting is terrible and obviously written by someone who isn't original English speaking. There are things said that no normal social human would say. Important to note like Birdemic this is written by someone who doesn't gets social interaction.It is an experience the actors are on the wrong spot. Well Greg was fine but he played before in other soap operas so! The rest is pretty much horrible and the worst Johny, or Tommy Wisseau Himself. Oh I am smiling right now!

            "content": "After reading the book \"The Disaster Artist\" by this films one and only Greg Sestero, I felt extremely compelled to write a review for this tour de force of \"so bad it's good\" cinema.The plot of the film is that a man named Johnny (played by Tommy Wiseau) has a \"future wife\" named Lisa (played by Juliette Daniel) who is having an affair with Johnny's best friend Mark (played by the previously mentioned Greg Sestero.) Also, there's this creepy kid named Denny (Phillip Haldiman)who hangs out with them and likes to watch them have sex. This kid doesn't have much relevance to the plot, in fact most scenes he is in make no sense at all, such as a drug dealer scene where he's held up before Tommy and Mark come to his rescue. This scene is never mentioned again.I have been a fan of \"The Room\" for nearly a year, and within this time I have seen it about 5 or 6 times. Every time I watch it, I notice something new. Whether it be about Tommy's acting, or about how during Tommy's freak out a picture he knocks down leans on the camera, I always find something new to laugh about. This is the film that saves me from having to find a good comedy at social events. The Room is always acceptable to watch at parties, as anyone can find it funny.The Room is one of those movies that you have to see to believe. Tommy Wiseau is one of the strangest actors ever. Not one of his pieces of dialog is pronounced correctly, not one of his lines is said in unbroken English. But he says these ridiculous lines with such confidence and passion you can't help but laugh. Some other moments are really funny too, for example a scene where Lisa's mom (played by Carolyn Minnot) admits to having breast cancer and has no reaction to it at all, and neither does her daughter. Also, it's never mentioned again.That's a common theme right there. Most scenes in the Room are just pointless and serve nothing for the central plot. Even when there's a \"tense\" argument between Johnny and Lisa, they tell each other that they love each other and not to worry about it. Plus, the flower shop scene. My god, the Flower Shop scene. I implore you to watch the Flower Shop scene and not at least chuckle. Again, something you have to see to believe. The main characters also throw a football around in tuxedos, and afterwords Tommy and Greg sit in a coffee shop and Tommy makes the most abrupt change of subject ever that is never mentioned again. All of these scenes add nothing to the plot, but what you don't want to do is watch the film for the plot. You watch it for the hilarity.You can't talk about the film without mentioning the painfully long sex scenes that are an assault on all of the senses in the human body. They have the most cheesy music and cinematography that feels like its straight out of a 1984 VHS porn tape. But in a strange way- they're extremely hilarious. Two of the things I just mentioned, the score and the cinematography, are two of the things that add to the movie. The cinematography is completely strange, switching from HD film to 35mm film at random. The score is so soaked with melodrama that you can almost feel it dripping down your neck. Again, these things only elevate the hilarity of some scenes, especially the ones that have \"dramatic\" music to Johnny doing to worst chicken impression ever conceived.Going off the technical aspects, the green screen of San Francisco during the roof top scenes is so bad it'll make you cringe. It is the worst green screen I have ever seen, but guess what? It's hilarious.\"You're tearing me apart Lisa!\" Is the most quoted and one of the most hilarious scenes in the film, next to the \"I did not hit her, it's not true...\" scene. In fact, the first time I watched these scenes I had to catch my breath and wipe my eyes because I was laughing so hard. That's a valid description of the film right there.I can't find a way to properly conclude a review about one of the best worst movies ever made. It's a crazy movie-in short-but it'll change your life in ways you couldn't think imaginable. The Room gets a 1, which is to be expected, but in terms of hilarity it gets a 10. Seriously, take a break from all those Hollywood comedies and watch the Room. I'm sure you'll find it funnier than most of them anyway. I can't end this review without saying: \"Ha ha ha, what a story Mark.\"",

Why is it not a good idea to cut between two takes during a long dialog scene when one actor is picking up and putting down a wine glass after every sentence?6.

Would the loss of a promotion and an unfaithful girlfriend be considered a mortally stressful situation to a character that has not been established to be suffering from emotional problems?8.

            "content": "So, what I took away from this film regarding the plot is this. Johnny is getting married to his girlfriend Lisa, yet she doesn't love him anymore, she has fallen for his best friend Mark. We know they are best friends because every time Mark and Lisa have sex, he says he shouldn't because he's Johnny's best friend, then he proceeds to have sex with Lisa. Everything comes to a climactic halt at Johnny's birthday party and the lies get unraveled. So, for those of you not familiar with the film, let me give you a bit of information regarding the production and the final film itself. Most of the dialogue had to be dubbed, mostly for the lead actor (who is also the writer, director, producer) and most of it is out of sync. All of the cast, never acted before. The actor who plays Mark agreed to play the role 72 hours before filming began. The actor who played Peter, quit the production half way, so a new character was written and given all of Peter's lines. This character is never named, or explained who he is. Now let's look at the subplots, events that happen in the film and the impact they have on the story.Lisa and her mother are discussing the party for Johnny, when Lisa's mother out of the blue says this: \"I got the results of the test back. I definitely have breast cancer.\" \"Oh, you'll be fine\" was the response from the daughter. The cancer is never spoken of again. One character shaves his beard and other characters decide to dedicate full conversations to it (to fill up time?). Characters are wearing tuxes and then decide to play some football in the middle of the street. I must have missed why they were wearing the tuxes, wedding rehearsal? Characters randomly drop by the house to see if Johnny or Lisa is home, it doesn't matter if they are or not, they leave a minute later and tell the person who answered the door to tell the person they said hi. Denny, a young boy that Johnny helped get a place and paid for, owes a drug dealer some money. After Johnny and Mark take care of the drug dealer, this is never mentioned again. I have no idea what happened to the drug dealer. Denny also apparently wants to watch Lisa and Johnny have sex. Characters missing halfway through, unexplained. The list goes on and on. The first 20 minutes, there are four sex scenes. One of which uses the same shots from the previous sex scene. One couple decide to go into Johnny and Lisa's house to have sex, the don't live there, but they have easy access. Tommy Wiseau, the creator of the film, claims to have intentionally made a black comedy, this is BS. The film was clearly trying to be a serious drama and it fails at that. The acting, is well, terrible. The mother seemed to be the only one 'trying'. Well, maybe Wiseau was trying, I couldn't tell. His most emotional scene was his tantrum at the end, throwing things around and tearing the house apart. He looked like he was sleepwalking while he was doing it. I suggest playing a drinking game while watching this, with friends, not alone. Take a shot every time someone says \"I don't want to talk about it\", anytime Johnny laughs for no reason, anytime you see a football, anytime roses make an appearance, anytime someone says future wife/husband and of course, anytime something inexplicable happens. You'll be wasted within the first ten minutes.I don't hate the film, I adore it for the absurdity. He tried, failed and is now riding the failing success to the top. The film is considered a cult classic. The 'Citizen Kane' of bad movies and Wiseau is using that to his advantage, smart move. Had he tried to defend the movie, it would have turned into a Showgirls. I wish someone had given me 6 million dollars to make a movie. I would have turned something in better than this. The guy didn't know the difference between 35mm and digital, so he filmed the movie with both cameras side by side. Interesting way to do things, but not showing confidence in your actors there. At least one of them knew what kind of movie it was and split before the film was finished. I would even make a better alley way set. I don't really know what to rate it.",

The Room is an unintentional disaster that makes it a compounded mess of a film that you just can't help love to watch, which is what has created the cult following. It deserves the poor ratings but that doesn't reflect the genuine joy you will actually get from this film, a kind of schadenfreude.To summarise, if you take out any film making textbook and list the key needs for any films, this doesn't fit the bill. The end result is like a trifle without the jelly, using custard not made with eggs, and using pepper instead of the topping sprinkles. It really is that strange. Everything that could be done wrong has been (without intention too).The main aspect that astounds is how the crew were awarded $6m to make this tripe! The lead is vain as hell, being the writer/director/lead 'star' in this absurd movie, yet for all his faults he has some charisma (best admired or humoured with from afar). He can't act, direct or manage. The story has lots of lost strands, the actors aren't even actors it seems, the settings are minimal and woeful, and the whole thing has lots of laughable dialogue (and I've never laughed at love scenes in a film so much in my life!).I watched this recently as part of a cult showing at cinema, with the spoon throwing and quote alongs, and I'd a great time. When you watch it for the first time, you can't but be carried along with the sheer audacity of what is in front of us. Admittedly I'm not sure I'd want to do repeat viewings. The film is \"tearing us apart\", and is carried by the vanity and ineptitude of the lead who is pathetic but cult he is. He's a character and in this day of over managed productions, this is a crazy throwbacks. In fairness, despite the tag, it isn't actually the worst film you'll ever see, there are big budget movies you'll see who are more deserving of that tag.Simply, get some friends, some plastic spoons to throw about and sit & watch this film.

            "content": "Wow, this was something. It's like it's so bad that it magically became good. Everything about it was so odd and curious. I felt I was watching a porn parody, especially during this exchange between Lisa and Mark: \"I miss you.\" > \"I just saw you. What are you talking about?\" > \"I just wanted to hear your sexy voice. I keep thinking about your strong hands around my body. It excites me so much.\" Juliette Danielle also resembled Ella/Jean Hollywood with a little bit of WWE's Bayley, too, regarding the way she smiles and laughs sometimes; she even resembled Sean Murray sometimes with the way her mouth moved while talking. Not only that, she looked like three different people throughout the film.It even has nudity and \"sex scenes\" to give it that subtle authenticity, but there's a problem. This wasn't porn, giving you blue balls/blue bean, as Tommy Wiseau probably didn't even meet the standards of porn, so he had to settle for making this film, and we're all thankful for it, aren't we? Say, \"Thank you, Tommy Wiseau!\" He was also quite ripped, which I wasn't expecting.This film is cinema in its most authentic form, and I'm not kidding when I say that. Part of me was expecting it to be so bad on all fronts that I wouldn't have been able to enjoy it as much as I'd liked. Instead, none of it was that bad. But more importantly, not only was it quite enjoyable, I liked it quite a bit!? My favorite scene was when Mark playfully pushed Mike down onto the trash cans, causing me to almost cry from laughter. That was so unexpected but so hilarious.I mean, come on. There's so much to like about this film, like the impressive, straight-to-the-point not-messing-about dialogue with fantastic delivery and the long sex montages with the loveable song choices (seriously, though) that start playing so suddenly that it's comical: the obsession with throwing a football to each other, Tommy Wiseau's performance (down to the accent, line delivery, and that adoring, Zach Galifianakis/Alan in The Hangover films-esque laugh Johnny keeps doing every five seconds), and Greg Sestero's performance/how Mark kept being confused by Lisa's antics.Objectively, everything about this film isn't that good. Thrown into it; characters exist, and dialogue is said, but none of it has substance, and there aren't any introductions for the characters; they're not even caricatures. It's wild. Then, there was the ending, which was the cherry on top. It gave the impression that everything leading up to it was clear with its intention, expecting you'll be able to predict what happens at the end. The problem is that the opposite of what I said at the beginning of this paragraph would be necessary, so the ending came suddenly. And somehow, there's still some vague sense of coherency in the middle of all that confusion. But that's the bare minimum; the fact that everything about this film isn't that good still stands.However, it goes both ways. You can love it, too. And while it's easy to look at it objectively, especially as far as the acting is concerned, I thought Carolyn Minnott did well. A big part could've been because of everyone else, but I think her acting performance was genuinely good. I thought some parts of Robyn Paris' performance were good, also. Same with Dan Janjigian's performance. And the soundtrack was good; I liked the songs a lot, and the score was somewhat decent. Some people probably consider this film the lowest of the low and worst of the worst, giving it the lowest rating possible, although others, while still hating it, are more lenient. So, I guess I said that to say: it isn't all terrible.I know the story, which is probably stretching it, is so simple that it might get a groan out of you. I know the acting is questionable, and the pacing/structuring/editing probably adds to the feeling of that Renata Sorrah GIF going on in your head. That's probably more than enough to be unbearable and for most people to HATE this film, but I didn't. I loved it.",

This looked like the first draft of the screenplay with no editing or changes done to it at all. I didn't see any beginning to it, the middle was a turkey while the ending was even more frightening.Even Tom cannot explain the bizarre scenes where the male characters play with the ball? Or why Tom is so fascinated with the bridge? Or why did Tom's character Mark feel that Lisa had not had sex with him for a while when two out of the first three scenes were of their love making (which includes probably the scariest scene in film history: two repeated shots of Tom's butt when he is humping). Or why Lisa isn't happy with Tom? Or why was this movie even made? What annoys me is that Tom Wiseau called this a black comedy, when this movie barely is a film. I cannot really categorize this as a feature film as it does not deserve the recognition. I can only suggest a change \u2013 rename it as 'The Party' because the last few shots of the party scene is so memorable in its ineptitude and slipshodness that\u0085.. I'm speechless.My Rating: 0 / 10",

            "content": "Plan 9 from Outer Space is often cited as the worst movies ever made, there are many contenders that could take that title e.g. Caligula, Showgirls, Freddy Got Fingered, Jack and Jill, and many others, but this is the one mentioned the most, so I challenged myself, also being a critic, to watch it. Basically Johnny (Tommy Wiseau) is a successful banker living in a San Francisco townhouse, he seems to have everything he needs, a beautiful fianc\u00e9e named Lisa (Juliette Danielle), and many friends. But Lisa has become dissatisfied with their relationship, which has lasted for seven years, she finds Johnny boring and wants more excitement in her life. Lisa's classy, sophisticated mother Claudette (Carolyn Minnott), who has been diagnosed with breast cancer, thinks that Johnny is good for her, and that if she truly doesn't love him anymore, she should tell him. Mark (Greg Sestero) is Johnny's best friend, he often visits the house, Lisa seduces him, despite his initial reluctance they begin a secret affair. Denny (Philip Haldiman) is a neighbouring college student, Johnny is supporting him financially and emotionally, so the young man sees him as a father figure, he also a crush on Lisa. Denny gets himself into trouble, he owes money to drug dealer Chris-R (Dan Janjigian), who threatens him with a gun on the roof of the townhouse, but Johnny, Lisa and Claudette rescue him. Johnny meanwhile overhears Lisa confessing to Claudette about her infidelity, he decides to attach a tape recorder to find out who her secret lover is. Denny confesses his feelings for Lisa himself, but he understands he is young and will find true love one day, he encourages him instead to pursue one of his classmates. Johnny is going mad with his anger at Lisa's betrayal and his desperation to find out who she is sleeping with, so he calls upon his and Mark's friend Peter (Kyle Vogt), a psychologist, for help. Mark also confides in Peter as he feels guilty about having an affair, Peter questions if the affair is with Lisa, Mark attacks him and almost tries to kill him, but they quickly reconcile. It is Johnny's birthday, and despite her insistence that she wants to end the engagement, Lisa and others surprise him with a party at the house. One of Johnny's friends catches Lisa kissing Mark while the other guests go outside, they are confronted about the affair, but then Johnny and the others come back in. Johnny announces that he and Lisa are expecting a child, but Lisa reveals that she lied about this to cover up the truth about her affair. At the end of the evening, Lisa flaunts her affair in front of Johnny, who verbally and physically attacks Mark. After the party, Johnny locks himself in the bathroom in despair, when he eventually comes out, he retrieves the cassette player and listens to an intimate conversation between Lisa and Mark. Johnny is outraged for Lisa's betrayal, she is prompted to end their relationship and engagement permanently, she plans to leave and live with Mark. Johnny has an emotional breakdown, angrily trashing furniture and destroying items in the apartment, until finally he collapses to the floor, and commits suicide, shooting himself with a gunshot in the mouth. Denny, Mark, and Lisa hear the commotion and rush upstairs, where they find his dead body. Mark blames Lisa for Johnny's death, he scolds her for deceitful behaviour, and tells her to get out of his life. An emotional Denny wants to be alone with Johnny, Lisa and Mark step back to give him a moment, but ultimately, they all stay and comfort each other as the police arrive. Also starring Robyn Paris as Michelle, Scott Holmes as Mike and Greg Ellery as Steven. Wiseau (also writing, producing and directing) is an ugly and untalented actor, Danielle is equally dire as his long-suffering girlfriend, and most of the other cast members are either inexperienced, or just let down by the terrible dialogue they were given. It includes many elements you would expect to see in a badly made independent movie, silly characters, bad acting, repetitive and terrible dialogue, clumsy camerawork, mistakes included and not edited out, the odd green-screen background in the rooftop scenes, bad editing and narrative structuring, there is no real story or plot, and supporting character subplots are unresolved, most prominent being the mother's breast cancer storyline. But for its bizarre and unconventional storytelling, technical and narrative flaws, Wiseau's ridiculous performance, and its overall awfulness, it has gained a cult following, and it spawned the more successful biographical film about the making of it, The Disaster Artist, I admit myself that I couldn't stop watching this, it was funny for all the wrong reasons, and it one of those \"so bad, it's good\" experiences, but it is a lacklustre black comedy romantic drama.

First, it's amazing how the dialogue nonsensically bounces around topics yet also repeats earlier conversations, going everywhere and nowhere at once. Meanwhile, entire scenes are unrelated to the narrative while other scenes are copies of previous moments. Plot points are introduced and instantly abandoned. Characters' actions are inconsistent and illogical. This is amplified by the fascinatingly bad acting, particularly Tommy Wiseau's. His energy level is often inappropriate and his transitions between emotional beats are comically unnatural.From a technical standpoint, The Room has slight merit but only in a relative sense. The sound design is okay, but audio effects are overused and Tommy's dubbing is hilariously unconvincing. The camera framing mostly captures its subjects, but sometimes action is outside the shot. The musical mood is usually in the correct ballpark, but the end credits song is an R&B ballad that doesn't match. Lastly, the production design looks like actual sets, but they're cheap and poorly dressed. Ultimately, The Room is a symphony of disasters that is quite fun to laugh at. It's not for everyone and it's certainly not conventionally good, but The Room is a glorious wreck.Writing: 0/10\nDirection: 0/10\nCinematography: 1/10\nActing: 0/10\nEditing: 1/10\nSound: 1/10\nScore/Soundtrack: 1/10\nProduction Design: 1/10\nCasting: 0/10\nEffects: 0/10Overall Score: 0.5/10.",

I was living on the streets with no money and no reason to go on. But then I got the chance to see \"The Room\", and I instantly felt enlightened. I got the confidence to do something with my life. I owe everything to Tommy Wiseau. Every aspect of this film is flawless; the character's are all lovable, the set is believable, the screenplay is phenomenal. The whole movie is a message to us all; that love is blind. So please, if you ever get the chance to see this masterpiece, watch it. Then watch it again.

At least one reviewer mentioned the legendary \"Plan 9 From Outer Space\" in comparison, but I feel this film excels over the latter in certain areas such as crude acting, a muddled plot and strange, unappealing and undeveloped characters. Still, I reluctantly feel compelled to give it a 2 if only because of the appealing visuals of San Francisco (which are nonetheless odd for a film that wasn't primarily filmed in San Francisco, aside from the second-unit footage; wikipedia's article on the film relates that the rooftop scenes were filmed against a green screen with the city added in afterward). Instead of keeping this film in its current anonymous region of mediocrity with a mixture of very high and low votes, perhaps true fans should pitch in to plunge this film downward toward a place alongside other unique visions like \"Manos: The Hands of Fate\". Indeed, this film reminds me a great deal of \"Manos\" insofar as both were made by people outside the Hollywood mainstream (not so much the case with \"Plan 9\"'s Ed Wood); \"Manos\" is a bit more lucid than this film, but both share a similar kind of entertainment value for people who appreciate just how far this medium can be pushed and still be recognizable.",

If one is looking for cinematic achievements, acting, directing, or just anything that relates to this planet in general, then stop, and turn around. \"The Room\" is not of this planet. It's not of this universe, it defies everything logical. It is of the mind of the Michelangelo of filmaking, Tommy Wiseau. Everything wrong with this movie is everything right with it. Let's take a look and see just what \"The Room\" is. After the credits in which we are told that Wiseau is the mastermind behind this work of art, we are introduced to a man that looks as if his face has been chiseled out of a tree trunk with a butter knife as he arrives home. This is Johnny. When he speaks one can easily confuse him for Vladimir Putin, a Bulgarian peasant, an eloquent French liaison, or perhaps the voice of God himself. He resembles and is in fact all of these things, but not all at once. His wife, Lisa, recalls memories of the girl back in high school that used to be hot but now is a soccer mom. Anyways, back to the story, their neighbor Denny, a young boy with enough libido to rival that of a football team states with an innocent grin when the couple goes upstairs to make sweet love \"I like to watch.\" Of course you dear Denny. After watching Johnny thrust his member into Lisa's navel alongside a heart-throbbing R&B track, we are treated to see the beginnings of a love triangle. Lisa is no longer in love with Johnny, our blessed saint. She yearns for his best friend Mark, who delivers his lines so dryly, it rivals the drought in the Mojave desert.I can go on explaining the various subplots, all of which are dropped like an aborted baby. But this would be futile. One must see them for them self, to truly enjoy them. How can I explain the way Chris-R threatens Denny's life, and then Johnny shows up to take him to jail, and this incident is never heard of again? Where do I start, when telling you of the arrival of Peter the psychologist, who abruptly seems to die after tripping in a game of tuxedo football? Will you understand why Lisa's Mom's breasts have cancer? Or why the mysterious silk shirted man at Johnny's party feels the need to tell Lisa she's setting off an atom bomb? You won't, you cannot understand. You must watch. You must believe. Tommy Wiseau gave this gift, so others may have life. No one has ever delivered lines like him. No one ever will. \"The Room\" is waiting for you. Will you enter it? Grab a spoon and dig in to a big helping. Did I feel I wasted 100 minutes of my life when watching this?

            "content": "This is one of the hardest films to review. On one side, this is one of the worst films of all time, no doubt about it. But on the other, it's somewhat enjoyable to watch because of how hard everybody fails. I review films based on their quality and what they were trying to accomplish, so this review will treat this film just like any other. So get ready to read a nonstop list of how much this film sucks. The barely coherent plot starts out in San Francisco and follows our main character, Johnny (Tommy Wiseau), as he tries to please his \"future wife\" Lisa (Juliette Danielle) who is having doubts about their relationship. Johnny is as \"all American guy\" who loves freedom, football, and fun. Accompanying Johnny from time to time and filling the story with so many needless subplots are his best friends Mark (Greg Sestero), Denny (Philip Haldiman), and Peter (Kyle Vogt). All I'm going to say is that stuff happens throughout, but it's so stupid that nobody cares.Tommy Wiseau fills in as the star, director, writer, and producer for his passion project. It's good that he took on so many roles because it saved a couple of people the embarrassment of being a part of this film. The writing, pacing, and just about everything about this film could have been done better by a twelve-year-old. We end up watching softcore porn for the first twenty minutes of the film as three different sex scenes occur right after another, each one filled the worst R&B music ever. Characters appear in scenes for no reason and some characters just show up without a name or relationship to anyone else. It feels as if some random people got lost and accidentally ended up in the shot. The absolute weirdest thing about this film is that it is 99 minutes long and barely has enough content to fill a poorly written short. Scenes are needlessly overlong and subplots are added for no purpose or resolution.One could say that this film has an uplifting message for all film students out there. Tommy Wiseau was a passionate man who simply wanted to make a film, and with a script, he wrote himself and $6 million (seriously) he made The Room. If Wiseau can follow through with his dream and make the worst movie ever, then anybody can make their dreams come true. The acting in this movie is the best part about it but, just like everything else, for all the wrong reasons. Tommy Wiseau claims he wanted to channel James Dean in his performance, which is somewhat evident. The only problem is that Dean was a great actor and Wiseau is not. Tommy can't speak lower than a yell and can't speak English well enough to deliver a sentence. Greg Sestero, Tommy's on screen and real-life best friend also had a dream of being on the big screen. The good thing for him as is that he accomplished his dream, and he'll never have another chance to repeat it. He's bad, but he can say he's not the worst in the group. That honor goes to Juliette Danielle who probably says the same three lines of dialogue, with slight variations from time to time. With the release of The Disaster Artist and the cult status The Room has achieved over the years, I would recommend this film for anyone who feels like they don't have what it takes to make it into the film industry. After watching this, you'll be inspired to make your own film. And hey, even if you fail, you'll know you didn't fail as hard as Tommy Wiseau and his small group of wannabe stars.",

All in all, the film is entertaining much like Sharknado. The amount of plot holes are tremendous. Tommy Wiseau, Greg Sestero, and Juliette Danielle deliver some of the worst performances Hollywood has ever seen. The acting is inconsistent and always sounds scripted and is always overacted.The pacing is slow and for a film that is an hour and thirty-nine minutes long, it's an hour and thirty-eight minutes too long.Sadly, the film is hilarious to watch and is probably one of the mist entertain movies I have ever seen because it is loaded with material.Overall Rating: 3.2\n (This is only a 3.2 because it is hilarious and kinda entertaining)",

Now that there is no room for any confusion here I go with my review. There are 2 crucial scenes that I cannot forget about this movie. Firstly: The scene where Johnny tells Mark \" I think you should leave right now mark\" after mark tells johnny \"Lisa changed her mind about you wake up man what plan are you on?\" Secondly: The scene where johnny kills himself and lies on the ground while mark Lisa and Denny still have some lines to say before the movie ends. In both scenes Tommy Wiseau's face and acting were so convincing that it just put me through a roller coaster of emotions. I mean I was just having fun, making fun of the scenes prior to these every thing was so funny the lines were so original and out of this world and at the same time hilarious the acting was theatrical, exaggerated and therefore can be considered bad for a movie... It didn't make any sense it was like watching an absurd comedy. But here is the important part for me. After these two scenes that I mentioned I wasn't laughing anymore. I was at such a state that I didn't give a single flying fudge about how nonsense the previous scenes about the movie were how I was making fun of the characters, the lines, the atmosphere, the conversations... none of these mattered at that point. I really felt sorry for what johnny was going through. Anyways in the end this original movie indeed changed my life. I wish I had watched it 14 years ago then by now I would be a much better man I'm sure of it. I always wanted to enjoy the life at its maximum limits. Think of a situation that you jumped from an airplane unwillingly without a parachute. What will you do at that point? will you cry knowing that inevitable death awaits you in a few seconds? (by the way according to a myth I heard in such situation you will die of a heart attack mid air because of the intense fear of death) or do you have the capacity to enjoy the feeling of the free fall despite the fact that you know you are going to die after you hit the ground so hard that your internal organs will scatter inside you?

The dialogue is mis-timed and jumbled (see florist conversation), the characters lack any sense of passion or arc, and while the direction gives us some great establishing shots of San Fransisco we remain trapped in the scrubby apartment these character's lives get entangled in. Someone drops in to say hi or something else pointless and meaningless to just leave 30 seconds later. Huh? Motives are questionable and literally slapped together with little to no thought involved. Someone will ask a question to say \"I don't care\" a second later. The list is endless. Let me just day if you're having a bad day or suffering from some sort of depression that this film is the cure. The only thing better than laughing your ass off at the bad lines and jumbled order of those same lines is watching other people react to this flawed masterstroke of incompetence.Then I checked the budget. 6 MILLION DOLLARS. For something that looks like it could have been put together by a high schooler. Basically, the only summation I can make is Tommy Wiseau is an enigma. Did he mean for the film to come out this way? Or is his version of reality so diluted we get that product on the screen? The world may never know.",

These classic films have earned their ten star ratings. Please quit compromising the quality of reviews on IMDb with these inflated ridiculous scores. It's not fair to the REAL filmmakers who have earned their stripes through years of work, and defined talent.

I dare anybody to do a drinking game - one shot for every time they say \"oh hi 'name'\" and 5 shots for the infamous \"oh hi Mark\" line. There is just no chemistry or emotion between the characters or actors. They just seem like a bunch of fake friends pretending to like each other. The characters themselves were just dry and colorless and had no dimension at all. The story itself is stupid. Maybe different story arcs looked good on paper, but the execution was poor. And to top it all off, there are a few more sex scenes than necessary.Now that the complaints are out of the way, let me give credit where credit is due:\nEverything that makes The Room bad is everything that makes The Room good.Of course it's a bad film, but it has its charms. The story of the Room was flawed, but it really did have some good themes in there, and its obvious that Wiseau tried his best to get different messages across, particularly through the use of Danny's character. Hearing about the making of the film is interesting as well and adds to the experience (watch Disaster Artist before and/or after watching the Room). My rating is 3/10 - 2 stars for the attempt of making a decent move, and 3 stars for Sir Tommy Wiseau.Tommy Wiseau gave it his all in this film. He wanted to make a movie, so he did. Though I'm sure the movie upon release was received poorly, he continues to work to this day and has many beloved fans that follow this cult classic. It's honestly inspiring that he achieved success, but in a way he probably wasn't expecting. As low quality as the Room is, it was at least entertaining. I plan to watch other Wiseau films someday, just to see how much has evolved, and to support an independent film maker who dedicates his life expressing himself through the art of film.",

            "content": "It's hard to add anything new to a movie that has been described as possibly the best worst movie ever made. It has been said to resemble a depiction of humanity as done by an alien who watched only 24 hours of our television, while others praise it as the best unintentional comedy ever made. Whatever the case may be, everyone who has ever used the term 'worst movie ever' on Godzilla, Waterworld or a Star Wars prequel/sequel should be forced to watch this movie and reconsider. Opinions vary on whether The Room is retrospectively brilliant in that it stumbled upon important themes of friendship, fate and betrayal, but it is generally agreed upon that its merits, bad or good, actively contribute to the fun of watching it. There's no better proof that entertainment can be independent of quality than this movie.In the amusing 'making of' movie The Disaster Artist, it is postulated that writer/actor/producer/director Tommy Wiseau survived a major accident years before he started his magnum opus that is The Room. I am extremely curious to know if this is what happened in real life, because it would explain a lot. As a student I learned that paintings and drawings made by patients with mental disorders could often be used to perfectly exemplify what their ailments were. If this comparison extends to all art in general, including film, then The Room is a look into an extremely fractured mind. This should be mandatory viewing for every medical student who ever considers neurology as a major.Because let's not fool ourselves: this must be the most disjointed and inconsequential movie ever made. Wiseau claims to have wanted to make a movie about 'human nature', and it looks like he decided to go through every type of human action and feeling imaginable in a mere 90 minutes, without any narrative, logical or dramatic cohesion. Normally, a plot is a course of events where one occurrance initiates another, but most of what happens in The Room is a non-sequitur. Of all the misery, joy and ill-defined stuff that happens over the duration of this movie, only a fraction seems to have any long-lasting effect on the plot or characters in one way or another. Drugs, disease, arguments, violence, love, sex and alcohol all pass by for the sake of human drama, characters come and go, but they are often forgotten by the next scene (or even in the same scene), to be never mentioned again or no longer be of significance. You could effectively edit out the entire second act without any negative bearing on the film's final act. This is the kind of film in which people don't seem to be doing anything, yet they claim to be busy; where mothers in 2003 still urge their daughters to marry for financial stability rather than love; where one of the actors was no longer available, so they gave his lines to a completely new character without any introduction, and where there is always time for a game of football without any symbolic or metaphorical meaning. The royal amount of sex scenes almost begs a comparison with a lot of soft-porn B-movies from a decade before, but even those had better writing, acting and directing. As hard as it is to believe, there was even supposed to be a subplot about vampires that didn't make it. Too bad, because it would have made this movie brilliant in its failure over multiple movie genres.Coupled with his complete lack of talent in telling a story, Wiseau doesn't seem to understand what natural dialogue sounds like. Almost all conversations contain something ridiculous, overblown, pompous, inappropriate or nonsensical. Much of the movie's cult appeal comes from endless repetitions, e.g. that Lisa looks beautiful, Johnny and Mark are best friends, the world is treacherous and people don't want to talk about stuff. But the true gold is in such classic quotes like \"Oh hi, Mark!\", \"You are tearing me apart!\" or \"Why? Why is this happening to me?\" Granted, it doesn't help that there is hardly a decent actor in this film, but the bad script and even worse directing of the actors gives them very little to work with. Everybody seems to be going through a mood swing every two lines, and displays at least 10 different states of mind over the course of the film. Characters constantly contradict themselves or seem to have an extremely short-term memory. If there is one positive thing I can say about this movie, it is that the only things sillier than the acting and dialogues are the cheesy lyrics to the songs that accompany the gratuitious and protracted sex scenes (such as the text \"you are my rose\" endlessly repeated).The only job where Wiseau fails even worse than as a writer or director is as an actor. The cult value of his portrayal cannot be overstated. He almost looks and sounds like a heavily drugged and sedated combination of Gru from Despicable Me with Loki from Thor, who is trying to impersonate Pauly Shore. It has to be seen to be believed. His final scene and the movie's finale is the stuff of talentless overacting legends. If you haven't rolled off the couch by then, you'll never will.In conclusion, it is quite irrelevant to say that as a film, The Room makes every mistake in the book and is the most unlikely culmination of bad decisions that may have ever been made, since this is exactly the reason for what makes it so alluring. You can have discussions about guilty pleasures, but as long as there is no concensus on what constitutes great art, those won't be very meaningful. If cabinets made from wreckage and dresses made from meat can be forms of art, why not this dubious cinematographic experiment? Something so uniquely bad comes by only once in a generation. So is The Room a good movie? Not by a long shot. Does it make for interesting art? That's the idea.",

People come over to the apartment and then leave at the end of their scene which is usually 2 minutes after they arrive. Performances range from terrible to passable. Greg Sestero who plays Mark appears beleaguered throughout which is probably not acting but more the amount of work he was doing behind the scenes.All in all it's worth seeing to prepare to see the dramatized making of movie 'the Disaster Artist.

That just tells me you haven't seen enough really terrible films.\" You might think you have seen a truly atrocious film; but if you've yet to see Tommy Wiseau's infamous melodrama 'The Room', you haven't. Believe me. This is indeed one of those bad movies. One that is so staggeringly awful that it becomes something highly entertaining. Retrospectively, writer/director/producer/actor Tommy Wiseau has asserted that the film was intended to be \"a black comedy\", but conversely, numerous cast members have objected, outlining that it was unintentionally bad. Frankly, it's hard to tell.Put simply, 'The Room' is a movie about a guy whose fianc\u00e9e is cheating on him with his best friend, but like Pandora's Box it is so much more than that \u2013 it is a film that is bad in virtually every aspect. The script (was there even one?) flows terribly and features multiple inconsistencies (characters and seemingly important plot strands disappear for no reason) and countless things that just don't make any sense (for example, the character of Denny or a conversation about banking where the protagonist played by Wiseau randomly asks his friend \"So how's your sex life?\") The score is nauseatingly bad. The various sex scenes are tediously pointless and beyond cringeworthy. The acting is unanimously terrible. With his accent that sounds like a queasy concoction of Schwarzenegger and Borat doing a shoddy Christopher Walken impersonation, Tommy Wiseau is a fascinating presence to watch on screen, albeit because of his apparent lack of any sort of acting talent. Yet, despite this he has crafted something that no one else has arguably done \u2013 he has made the worst film of the 21st century thus far. \"The Citzen Kane of bad movies\", Entertainment Weekly called it; Variety proclaimed that it \"prompts most of its viewers to ask for their money back \u2013 before even 30 minutes have passed\"; or comedy writer Robert Popper's comment that \"every scene is perfectly bad.\" These statements might sound over-the- top if you haven't seen it, but if you have then you know that they do indeed ring true and could even be considered understatements.Over the years, 'The Room' has developed a cult following, with multiple fan screenings around the world and a fanbase that includes Jonah Hill, Kristen Stewart, Edgar Wright and Kristen Bell. None of this is particularly surprising, because it is one of the most purely entertaining movies I've seen; it is truly terrible, but so incomprehensibly so that it never fails to put a smile on my face or make me howl with laughter. It has to be seen to be believed and if you've seen it already, watch it again.",

Besides delivering a knee-slapping chucklefest for discriminating purveyors of alternative-style humor like myself (and my future wife, who watched it with me), this cinematic gem is also a thinly veiled love letter from Mr. Wiseau to all the ladies of the world. This is most evident by all the time \"Johnny\" dedicates to keeping \"Lisa\" satisfied in \"The Room\". The prowess he displays in the bedroom is staggering. My future wife played it off, but she noticed. I mean, how could I blame her? Just take that trademark slow-but-steady thrust Johnny delivers to Lisa's abdominal region on numerous occasions. Or how his arm stays flexed when he's spooning with her, even when he's sound asleep.

Now I've seen my share of cult films that started out as bombs at the box office, but now that I've actually seen the movie, I can't get over who awful it really is. Whe they said it's a really, REALLY bad film, they were not kidding. Did Tommy Wiseau wake up one day and decide to make a film? Sure looks that way. The badness is beyond comprehension.1) Let's get this out of the way: Regardless of what Johnny, Mark, or any guy in the movie says, Lisa is not sexy/beautiful/hot, etc. She's not ugly by any means, but she looks more like a plain Jane posing for a Lane Bryant catalog. 2) The first scene with Johnny and Lisa going upstairs about to get intimate---and Denny follows them? WTF? This is supposedly a kid and he wants to watch his, uh, what exactly ARE Johnny and Lisa in relation to Denny? Adoptive parents? Guardians? Babysitters? Whatever, why is Denny not getting the hint that Johnny and Lisa want to be ALONE? No wonder he turns to drugs. Or maybe, like Johnny tells Mark later on, he should get a girl. 3) Story lines that come and go without any resolution, like Claudette's breast cancer or Denny's run-in with a dude with a gun asking about his money.4) Characters that are not properly introduced, like the couple that decide to stop by Johnny and Lisa's apartment to feed each other chocolate. Or the therapist that seems to give lame advice to Johnny and is a chicken for not wanting to play Toss The Football. Or that other guy that catches Lisa and Mark getting cozy at Johnny's birthday party. 5) What's with calling someone that doesn't want to do something chicken and going cheep-cheep-cheep-cheep? I expect this behavior from grade school kids, not grown men and whatever Denny is suppose to be.6) Chocolate is NOT a symbol of love. And eating chocolate from a woman's neck is NOT romantic. It's gross. 7) You really see how badly edited this film is from watching the scene when Lisa is holding/not holding a wine glass. 8) Is Lisa's neck pregnant? WTF IS THAT??? 9) So Wiseau manages to get beautiful shots of San Francisco, but when it comes to the rooftop scenes, he uses greenscreen? 10) Headscratching lines like:\"Leave you stupid comments in your pocket.\" \"What kind of money?\" and the unromantic \"Chocolate is a symbol of love.\" 11) The scene in the coffee shop looked like the cameraperson left the camera running on the counter in the middle of lunch hour. 12) Love scenes that are more useful to promote abstinence than to entertain anyone.13) Start a drinking game for every time someone says \"Don't worry about it.\" \"I don't want to talk about it.\" or \"Oh hi {insert name here}.\" 14) Lisa orders the weirdest pizza topping combo I've ever heard of (half Canadian bacon with pineapple, half artichoke with pesto, and light on the cheese), only to end up with a plain cheese pizza. 15) Is Wiseau allergic to the word fianc\u00e9e? He constantly uses \"future wife\" or \"future husband\", which sounds really strange. 16) Mark tells a story about a girl he knew that had way too many boyfriends, one finds out about the others and beats the girl up, and Johnny finds the story funny? Seriously??? 17) Johnny and Mark running up a bunch of stairs in San Franciso, playing tackle in the park, and we can barely hear what they're saying. At least, I can't make out what they're saying. 18) I understand getting angry after finding out your fianc\u00e9e--- excuse me, future wife cheats on you, but that was the worst wrecking-the-apartment moment I've ever seen. Even rock stars on drugs do a better job wrecking their hotel rooms. 19) The only credible actor in this whole film is the pug. \"Hi, doggie.\" 20) Finding Johnny dead in a pool of blood and NO ONE thinks to call the police nor an ambulance? They just sit there and cry? What, they think their tears will resurrect poor Johnny? If they ever make a sequel (let's pray they don't), those will be some incredible wonder tear powers.",

I have very really laughed so much at a screwball comedy let alone a movie labeled as a romantic drama. Every single scene had me in stitches. Tommy Wiseau is either the worst filmmaker ever or secretly the comedic genius the world needed. I prefer the former as him genuinely thinking this movie was going to be great makes the movie a whole other level of funny. Trust me you want to watch this movie it is an experience you won't have with any other movie. So bad it's actually amazing!",

            "content": "I became aware of The Room after reading reviews for Birdemic, comparing two bad films. So I had to sit down and watch The Room to see for myself, which I did with no preconceptions about it other than a few vague references to it being a bad movie.I won't say it's the worst film ever made, since I believe that (dis)honor goes to Birdemic in my opinion. While The Room had atrocious acting, a lousy plot, and poor dialog, it at least had decent editing and good sound although if I see one more panning shot of San Francisco I think I'm going to vomit.Several things which brought this film down were the aforementioned poor acting (whoever told Tommy Wiseau that he could act needs to be slapped senseless), lousy dialog, and poor plot. There was only one or two decent actors in the whole film.The character of Denny was just annoying. I mean, he's 18, not 8 for goodness' sakes, why does he want to throw the football around all the time? Speaking of which, the one football toss scene where the actors kept running into and out of the scene reminded me of a Saturday Night Live skit.The use of green screen in the rooftop scenes was pretty noticeable, partially because the actors hair didn't blow in the wind. This wasn't particularly annoying though.There was nothing lovable about the character of Johnny which made you want to like him. The way he acted didn't give off any feeling of warmth, so why was everyone so concerned about his feelings? There also could have been a couple of good subplot with Denny & the drug dealer, but once that conflict was over, it was never mentioned again, nor did they ever figure out why he was buying drugs anyway. Same with Lisa's mother telling her about having breast cancer, almost in passing. But once that scene was over, nothing else was ever said. It's like those parts of the movie were just thrown in for the heck of it. The fight scenes were totally unrealistic (as was everything else) and near the end when Johnny was going on his \"rampage\" was pretty laughable. Basically the whole movie was worse that a Lifetime made-for-TV movie, with basically the same plot. Even as a so-bad-it's-good type of movie, this one doesn't even make me want to laugh at it.",

            "content": "If we had to choose the king of trash movies, that title would probably go to The Room. It's so horrible you can't help but love it. And just wait till you hear some background information! Tommy Wiseau apparently financed this movie by selling leather jackets imported from Korea. An actor decided to leave the crew while filming, so they picked another person to finish shooting his scenes; because of that, we have two completely different people playing the same character. Doesn't this sound promising? The Room tells us about the life of Johnny (Tommy Wiseau), a successful banker who lives with his soon-to-be wife Lisa (Juliette Danielle), has many friends and is loved by everyone. Unfortunately, his girlfriend doesn't love him any more and is having an affair with his best friend Mark (Greg Sestero), who is constantly battled between his desire to be with Lisa and not wanting to hurt Johnny.Everybody agrees that nothing about this movie works. The story is recycled, the acting is bad and the cinematography is not worth mentioning. Certain scenes and characters are put into the movie for no apparent reason, except for making it last longer. The dialogue is repetitive and predictable. I guess you're supposed to sympathise with Johnny, because he's such a good, naive person being betrayed by the two people he loves the most \u2013 but you don't, because all the feelings in this movie are just words. But, after you get over the first minutes of confusion in the beginning, The Room is guaranteed to make you laugh really hard.Besides, this movie is a cult. Who could possibly forget the roof scene, in which Johnny talks to himself and later realises Mark is also present? The famous phrase \"oh hi Mark\" is used in this scene. Or all those inexplicable random football tossings, that once happened while the characters were in tuxedos? And of course, the flower shop, one of the most confusingly useless scenes in movie history. All this can be pretty frustrating to watch, but you shouldn't take it too seriously. If you don't, at the end you might even want to see it again sometime, maybe just to have a few good laughs and to remind yourself that it can always be worse \u2013 you could have been born as Tommy Wiseau!

            "content": "The story of 'The Room' can honestly be inspirational. Tommy Wiseau was a nobody before this film and now we all quote his lines from this disaster. I have never reviewed such a film, a film that is filled with horrible acting, editing, lighting or special effects yet for some reason is so great. Of course the pure stupidity of this film was never intentional which is why it is so hilarious. Wiseau intended this to be a breakthrough motion picture, the film that would catapult him to the top of the food chain in Hollywood. This attitude can be seen when you watch 'The Room'. It is very easy to spot the indulgence of the film maker, he gives it his all in the film. Don't get me wrong, his performance is truly terrible but he is still trying so hard which in a lot of ways I admire. The film went through horrible production issues, many of the crew members abandoned the project and Wiseau had to find replacements. I admire that he continued and finished the picture even with everyone against him. The film offers some of the hardest laughs I have ever seen in a film, I laughed more frequent than even in some of the better comedies. This is absolutely a remarkable picture that I believe should be seen by everyone. Especially that we are now getting the behind the scenes story of this film in this year's 'The Disaster Artist'. In summary, I do not think that 'The Room' is good movie, it's the exact opposite but what makes the film so great is the fact that they were trying so hard to make a good movie. Wiseau wanted to make a thought provoking and dramatic picture, but it turned out to be a perfect example of a disastrous piece of art.",

I had heard about The Room years before I actually saw it, watching the Nostalgia Critic's review of the film and also viewing Cinema Sins' take on the movie. Since it is so infamous, when I saw the poster for the screening, I instantly knew I would have to attend. Unbeknownst to myself and the friend that I was with, the film's following is devote just like the following for The Rocky Horror Picture Show. At the screening, fans had showed up in suits, were throwing a football around, chucking spoons and other plastic cutlery at the screen, and repeating lines of dialogue along with the film. It was an absolute blast and the only to see this cult classic. The film itself is terrible, but at this point, it doesn't really matter. I was laughing so hard I was crying during this movie, along with the rest of the audience. The experience is definitely worth the film itself!",

This movie is bad, bad, bad, bad, bad. So bad, that it becomes a gigantic joke. And Mr. Wiseau is riding in the top of it.The plot? (spoiler alert) a cyborg called Johnny works in a bank, but his girlfriend, Lisa, cheats on him with his \"best friend\" Mark. Why?, because \"Lisa is so beautiful\", and \"she doesn't love Johnny anymore\". Yep, those are all the reasons we got. In fact the lines \"Lisa is so beautiful\", \"Johnny/Mark is my best friend\" and \"I don't love Johnny anymore\" are repeated over and over again. I think Mr. Wiseau was worried with viewers forgetting those important plot points. So, at the end, Johnny finds out everything in his birthday party, and he kills himself after destroying a room. Yep, pretty lame.But, from this lame plot as the seed, a mighty tree of awfulness grows. The dialog is stupid beyond belief: repetitive, with scenes thrown at random and other scenes almost duplicated point by point. The acting is awful, and subplots and characters are introduced and then dropped immediately. And, the cherry of the cake are Tommy Wiseau's \"acting\" skills... which are so hilariously bad, it's incredible, a must-see.So, as a movie, this thing is a failure of epic proportions. As a piece of unintentional entertainment, is the best thing ever made.1/10",

In retrospect, Tommy Wiseau's \"The Room\" is an indie film that is overlooked for all the \"right reasons\". It's a black comedy romance, that revolves around a love traingle between Johnny (Tommy Wiseau), Lisa (Juliette Danielle), and Johnny's best friend Mark (Greg Sestero). The overall narrative is confusing with several subplots juggling around at the same time. Any movie-goer (even little kids) could point out all the plot holes and visual errors of this 90 min film. The characters are all from the stockpile of any movie clich\u00e9 one can think of. The dialogue is beyond the horribleness of a George Lucas (not to mention that most of Tommy Wiseau's dialogue is dubbed). Nothing is subtle in this film, any moment of awkwardness sticks out like a sore thumb. Despite these numerous faults, \"The Room\" is probably the most entertaining film ever made. I wouldn't be lying if I said I would watch this film over and over again and still laughing at Tommy Wiseau's odd delivery of lines and the awkward \"filler scenes\" that flushes away some of the drama. Tommy Wiseau may be one of the worst filmmakers in history. However, he should also be credited as one of the most important filmmakers who revitalized the cult followings of other independent films overlooked by the mainstream audiences and critics.",

This film has nothing good in it. Nothing! This particular gem of awfulness was written, produced, and directed by a guy named Tommy Wiseau. He was also the main actor. No one knows where he's from (I think he's Eastern European), but he is such a terrible actor. Every line of dialog he speaks is emotionless, boring, and has this very snooty feeling about it. That's not even the worst part. He can't enunciate his words correctly. Not a single phrase is spoken correctly. It's so bad that it's actually funny. The film is about a guy named Johnny, who works at a bank and lives in an apartment in San Francisco. He lives with his fianc\u00e9e Lisa, has a best friend named Mark, and a high school/college student named Denny who is is admirer. We never see Johnny at his job; we just see him play football in a tuxedo, and make passionate love with Lisa. However, Lisa becomes bored with him (how does that happen), and she cheats on him with...you guessed it, Mark. I think Wiseau was trying to make a drama about cheating and the negative effects of it, but the film plot is so full of holes that you won't even know what's happening half the time. At least the plot's slightly better than Uwe Boll's films, but that's not saying much. Ultimately, even though I hate this film with a passion, I recommend that people go out and watch it. It's really interesting to see how this project went so bad, and it stands as a lesson to those who want to make movies. It's not as easy as it seems. Even though it's one of the worst films of all time, I recommend that you see it at least once. You'll thank me later. Final Verdict: 1/10* Recommend you see it at least once.",

That means something.This movie is really AWSFUL and the absolute proof that aliens exist!Because you HAVE to be an alien to: 1) be able to claim you're an American and yet speak with such an out-of-this-world Transyl-Bulgarian accent from Mars. 2) to actually open every scene with \"Oh hi, (name of the character)\". 3) to have the guts to show your naked body ON SCREEN after having it 'improved' by a delirious intern experimenting with botox. 4) have a talent to cast the worst actors and / or give the worst stage directions in history. 5) To remain faithful to the illusion that you have created a masterpiece for the rest of your life after all these horrible reviews AND to be convinced that only truly intelligent viewers could appreciate your work and that people could actually learn a lot from you. They should, just once, offer an Oscar for 'worst all-in-one film creator EVER'! Seeing how ONE SINGLE movie can be SO BAD in SO MANY different respects is mind blowing!This man has a TALENT! 1) Even if you tried REALLY HARD you could never be a worse actor than him. 2) Even the worst director could never willingly make a movie this crappy. 3) If a dog, just ran over by a truck, would try to bark together a script it would be better than this. This movie is awful, hilarious and un-be-lie-va-ble at the same time. Also, it's very very very SAD. It's obvious Tommy Wiseau wants you to feel for his character. He wants you to think Lisa is a bitch for leaving him, while actually you don't understand why any woman in her right mind would fall for a guy like that! He wants you to think his character is the most wonderful guy in the world! After all, he brings her flowers, takes care of a lonely boy, is not angry when people have sex in his apartment for no reason, etc. Even 'the mother-in-law' approves of him! He wants you to cry at the end when he commits suicide... but actually all you feel is: \"Go shoot yourself you big whiner!\" The only thing you're sorry about is that it took so long. This movie is obviously intended to be a drama but that's actually the last thing it is. It's not even a movie! At most, it's a documentary about a bunch of weird people trying to make one. The conversations are unnatural, the situations are bizarre, out of this world even. The choice of music (especially during the sex scenes - who asked for them anyway?!) is terrible! (You are my rose, you are my rose, you are my rose...)In drama class we used to practise our lines by throwing a ball at each other while saying them out loud. This guy actually uses this exercise in a scene several times! Hilarious! He probably read in a book on narratology that it's good to have your characters do something during a scene. :-) Imagine what would happen if Tommy Wiseau read a book on surgery!\"Anyway how's your sex life?\"Maybe Tommy Wiseau should study human behaviour in stead of 'Explaining it all on YouTube'. He'd notice people don't just say: \"I'm so happy to have you as my best friend and I love Lisa so much\"... out of the blue.Really dude: \"Show me don't tell me!\"Anyway...

            "content": "Is it really possible that this luminous masterpiece is a first feature film? It is as though Mozart had started his career in composition with one of his mature symphonies. What is totally special about 'The Room' is the visual control that Tommy Wiseau applies to the story, and his use of fabulous music to embed his amazing images in our mind. The 'Talented Mr. Ripley'-ish story could have been turgid, but Wiseau turns it into a mythic journey.At the heart of Wiseau's method is the fabulous use of repetition in his work with the character Greg. \"What's going on here?\". This has been characteristic of each of Wiseau's films. Here it totally sucks the viewer into the story and is just about, the high-point of 2000s cinema. Alongside this, Wiseau uses some of the most haunting music in existence. Whether it is Kitra Williams or Clint Jun Gamboa, Wiseau transports us with fabulous romantic imagery that perfectly balances it.I started on this comment determined not to use the word 'poetry', but I just can't avoid it. With nearly all filmmakers, including very great ones, the style that they present is very much prose - great prose, perhaps, but firmly rooted on the ground. With Wiseau, we are taken, emotionally, to the stars by the lyric magnificence of the totality of his vision.It is said that Welles learned cinema by watching John Ford's 'Stagecoach' before embarking on 'Citizen Kane'. Every young filmmaker should watch this amazing masterpiece again and again and again and inform their work with Wiseau's matchless sense of true cinema.",

That said, what the 10 star young people seem to rave about is the \"experience\" part of the screening. As \"Rocky Horror\" did years ago, \"The Room\" has created a cult following of young people (mostly) who go to the film to make fun of the corny dialogue and silly premises. As with any \"experience\" film, the fun is that most of the audience has already seen the movie. They shout out the dialogue and give appropriate groans when the dialogue is exceptionally bad (which is almost always the case). If that is what you crave - a social interactive film experience - then \"The Room\" is your kind of movie. It has nothing else to offer... really. It is not an independent classic. It is not the great insight of a film genius. It is not the latest trend in cinema (although it closely resembles aspects of reality television). And, it is not a good movie. It is a very, very bad movie. But the experience is fun. Thus ended the lesson.",

            "content": "This is seriously the worst movie of all time; there really is no contest here. The acting, the use of shots, the music and the overall premise is unbelievably bad. A love triangle between a banker, a hunk and a blonde woman is the plot of this film which has been likened to a play by the director, Tommy Wiseau. Unfortunately this same guy is the producer and writer. Oh, and he stars in it too.Do not go into this movie expecting the best romance ever made or even a decent romance for that matter. No matter how much potential each actor/actress holds, they all share the same emotionless line reading status. The main star of this film (and I guess rightly so because of how awesome he looks) is Tommy Wiseau who plays Johnny, a banker and lover. It is fair to say without insulting anyone that his accent alone makes the movie. His pronunciation of words and sentences has become standout moments in their own sense. Accompanying him and the other range of characters is a green screen backdrop overlooking a very bland looking city. Despite being called 'The Room', the apartment and the roof play big parts in this movie themselves.One of the worst things about this movie is the music throughout it. Despite the movie being a romantic drama, the dramatic piano theme that would be much better suited to a TV movie about hobbits, keeps coming back to annoy us viewers throughout various points in the movie. In the opening it works quite well and sets the scene but then it gets boring very quickly and it is ridiculously overused. If I see this next time then I will be tempted to start a drinking game involving the times this theme appears in the movie! The music is so laughably bad in parts of the movie (and by parts I mean the whole thing) that this makes the movie more laughable than it already is. For example, music suddenly plays when one of the characters, Greg, enters the room and then suddenly stops. This is only one of the many instances when dramatic music is used out of nowhere for no apparently reason! When it's not cheap instrumental music, it's instead cheesy lyrical love songs that play during the clich\u00e9d sex scenes.Another funny thing in this movie is the tendency to bring up random story lines and then get rid of them soon after. There is a breast cancer line spoken by the mother which is never referred to again in the rest of the movie. We are aware that it is a movie about love and not cancer, but if there's not going to be a resolution then don't bring it up to begin with. Another storyline that had a lot of potential to interest us viewers above the main storyline was Denny's drug money problems. A random thug appears on the infamous rooftop where he threatens Denny with a gun however after a commotion this is never talked about again. And what's with the couple who feel the need to make love in Johnny's apartment before Lisa and her mother arrive?This brings us to another problem in the movie. Many unimportant elements such as the random couple are focused on too much in this movie. The movie focuses on the couple's attempt at love-making for a few minutes which made me think that perhaps these are two other important characters in what could be a separate plot. But nope. They are just simply secondary characters who are never really focused on again; meaning the need to show them at all is simply pointless. In a caf\u00e9 scene, we are forced to sit through the orders of four random customers before Johnny comes into the scene! What is the point? Add to this the countless establishing shots in between more important scenes and it's fair to say this movie focuses too much on what shouldn't be focused on.This review could go on forever because there is a lot to say about this movie. And none of it is positive. However negative this review may seem though, this movie has actually given me one of the most joyful movie-going experiences in my life. I would pay over and over again just to see this movie. It is full of unintentional laughs because of its bad direction, terrible acting thanks to our star Tommy Wiseau and the unforgettable music. And for that, I want to thank Tommy for giving us a perfect example of not only everything a movie should never be; a good lesson to filmmakers and audiences alike, but also for giving us one of the best unintentional comedies of all time. I recommend this movie for a good time, and a good time only. Definitely a movie worth paying for if it is playing in your city.",

They would say one thing, but either have no emotion or the wrong emotion! The way Lisa acted, it was really unclear that she was a total lunatic. The way Johnny acted, SPOILER ALERT, I didn't think he cared enough about Lisa that he'd be distraught when she left. Sure, in the script he said it - but the actor never sold it. About that script - \"Don't worry about it!\" A little in joke because at one point Lisa's mom says she has breast cancer, and Lisa says \"Don't worry about it.\" So they don't - they never mention it again! This plays right into the wheelhouse of the Rifftrax gang and they don't disappoint. This movie had a few sex scenes (one of them was run twice) and that made the Rifftrax guys uncomfortable - but they did find a way to handle it that was pretty funny.The acting is so bad and the script is horrible, yet the performances are so ripe for making fun of. It is like \"Manos: The Hands of Fate\" bad. So awful it has become a midnight movie and pop culture phenomenon. Since watching this, I am now in on the jokes that are all over YouTube. I am sure it would be hilarious without Riffrax, but for me it was a lot of fun to watch with Mike and the Gang.SPOILER - At the end, when Johnny kills himself, they linger on the suffering of Lisa and Mark (fiance and best friend who have been doing it behind Johnny's back). Yet more egregious acting. I had to guess the writer was sending a message to someone who broke his heart! But he didn't kill himself - he sent his message this way. To the whole world.

I just recently saw this movie for the first time, and am already hooked. I cannot wait till next month when it will be shown in Hollywood again. Don't expect a good movie by any means when watching The Room, but instead, expect a movie going experience that you will never forget. Just hearing the comments veteran Room viewers yell out at the movie screen is enough to make you want to come back for more. The movie has NO CONTINUITY WHATSOEVER. It appears that the movie was never edited and that scenes are completely out of place, or in the movie for no reason. Several shots are reused scene after scene to save money on production costs. Yet, these things that are so wrong as far as regular movies go are what make The Room such a great movie. The fallacies are intentional and should be taken as such. Also, a big plus to the overall experience is the question and answer session before each screening by producer, director, writer, and lead star Tommy Wiseau. At least that is the case at all the Hollywood screenings at the Laemmle Sunset 5 on Hollywood Blvd. My advice to anyone who hasn't seen the movie yet is to see it with a friend, or a lot of friends, so that you can crack jokes with them while watching the movie. Also, you must see the movie more than once, YOU MUST. The movie is so much funnier the second time. Overall, The Room really is the best worst movie ever.",

I'm not sure which was greater, the number of softcore sex scenes that go on too long, the number of times the guys awkwardly throw a football around, or the number of conversations between mother and daughter where they say the same things to one another. Meanwhile, there is a tinge of misogyny in its charmless story.

From the ludicrously inept script to the bad soft-core porn scenes to the acting that makes Edith Massey look like Agnes Moorhead - it's just ... mind-crackingly horrid. I am a fan of unintentionally bad movies (The Apple is my favorite so far) But this ... this one takes the cake. I think the line that is said the most often is \"Don't worry about it!\" This line is an all-purpose line that can is said in response to everything from 'I have breast cancer' to 'I am leaving you.' The second-most popular line in this movie is 'I don't want to talk about it.' This is a great device to indicate the characters like to bring things up just for the sake of dropping the topic four seconds later. I confess I had to fast-forward through much of this (like all the sex scenes) But I had to watch Johnny's breakdown. This was like watching someone imitate Christopher Walken sleepwalking. But without any of the passion. I shan't see The Room again. Not only is it aggressively inept, it's tedious. Bad piled upon bad piled upon bad with no sense of direction or purpose is hard to watch for more than ten minutes.

Sometimes you even hear Wiseau talking when the character Johnny isn't moving his lips, at all. Insane.The love scenes are ridiculous, after maybe 25 minutes three (really bad) love scenes came by already (and i was by now bored out of my skull already). \b Throughout the movie various music tracks are played. Wiseau for reasons that are beyond me decided to use classical music AND r&b music in the same movie. Makes no sense at all.Don't be fooled by its cult status. This movie is worthless and not worth the watch. Apparently, this movie cost 6 million $ to make, IMO sure anyone else could have done a better job for 50 grand.

Was it because Johnny and Lisa had awkward sex in a room? Heck, it should have been called \"The Spiral Staircase\", if that's what they were getting at! The title is even misleading! It sounds like a horror film, like bad things happen in a specific room and you just don't go in there. But no. There's sex and death in one room. Wow.I have to say my favorite line in this movie was when Johnny was \"raving\" about how he didn't hit Lisa. I laughed so hard, I cried, and watched that scene a couple more times. The guy didn't even look mad when he threw the water bottle! (In fact, did Tommy have ANY expression on his face through the duration of the movie?) And then the quick, nonchalant \"Oh hey, Mark\" felt misplaced and awkward after the \"rant\". As if he knew Mark was there and planned to walk out \"griping\" about Lisa, then pretend he didn't know Mark was there.Well, if anything, this movie made me laugh. So many things made me uncomfortable because of how they were presented to the audience; I couldn't sit back and enjoy the movie at all. There was nothing to enjoy! So I thank the Nostalgia Critic for directing me to this film so I could see for myself how hilariously terrible it is. From now on, I think I'll let him remember it so I don't have to.",

'The Room' can restore that appreciation, not from any virtues which it possesses, but from the lack thereof. In short, The Room is an object lesson in what results from a production lacking artistry. This includes the performances, the script, the photography, the editing, the soundtrack....All these elements lack artistry in this film, and the results are so sadistic, that one will never lack an appreciation for good filmmaking ever again after seeing this movie. Some have described it as a traffic accident. I don't think this really does it justice. You might recall an accident in upstate NY a few years back. It involved an intoxicated mother carrying 5 or 6 children that collided head on with a vehicle with a father and his son riding in it, in which everyone but one child in the mother's car was killed. You catch my drift....After watching The Room, I don't think anyone could ever again be under the impression that good films just happen, or that making films is easy, or that little effort is required. 'The Room' will forever remain a testament to what the art of film sans 'art' is: and for that we owe the producers a debt of gratitude.",

If you don't know how - maybe sometimes its better not to do instead of doing and then becoming a joke target for centuries. I do admire that Tommy Wiseau at least tried to so something he was passioned about nevertheless. Overall, there isn't much to say about this movie actually.

But I guess I'll have to settle for a 1.People are honestly comparing this to other cult movie classics? How dare they? Even comparing it to Plan 9 From Outer Space isn't fair to Ed Wood. At least there were good parts and laughable parts in Plan 9. There's absolutely nothing redeeming about this movie and certainly no humor in it whatsoever. It's not a black comedy. It's something entirely different and all awful.The acting is forced and tired. The lines are pathetically written, if they were actually written, and delivered by people trying to act. This movie appeared to have a large budget. My question is where did it all go? That brings me to the plot, or lack thereof. Woman unhappy so she goes and has sex with other men seemingly every other scene? Makes up lies about him hitting her? It's just horrible. It's like a bad scene from a high school or a college brought sadly to life on a movie screen.The actors are just... terrible. Trying so hard to act and making the failure of the movie even worse. When a director has to get cryptic and \"deep\" about the meaning of a movie, that just means that he knows that he's failed and has realized it so he has to hide behind a shroud of mystery to try to save it. Sorry, but it didn't work.The constant laughing of the characters is annoying. The football scenes don't make any sense. And for as much as they supposedly love it, no one knows how to throw one.In conclusion, this is just awful. These actors should be ashamed of themselves and do us all a favor by never performing in another movie ever again.",

            "content": "The Room is perhaps one of the most spectacular films that I have ever witnessed. I have never seen anything so inept and troubled in my life. Indeed, there is something so pathologically wrong with The Room that somehow you can't quite help but applaud it while at the same time feeling like you must take a shower. Central to the film is Tommy Wiseau; the man in charge of the production. When exploring the background surrounding the film it can be noticed that Wiseau went to extreme lengths to make certain that this film be created. He wrote it as a novel and somehow managed to raise $6 million for the production of it. In fact practically every story I hear surrounding the making of this film is hilarious. This film is Wiseau's centrepiece, it feels as if it's his life's work. Yet, he doesn't stop at purely making it, he stars in it too. Wiseau plays the role of Johnny, an Angelic figure devoted to his \"future wife\" Lisa (who is perhaps one of the biggest enigmas to ever appear on the big screen). Johnny is certainly something special; without him this film would not be what it is. He is the central orb in which the rest of this tragedy collapses around. He is perhaps the most complicated character ever created; some believe he is from Croatia, Belgium, Norway, Finland and I've heard Denmark too. Whatever country he is from, he certainly isn't American as Wiseau has claimed. Heck, I still wonder whether he's even of this world. Whatever the conclusion, Johnny is perhaps one of the greatest characters to ever come into creation. The entirety of this film is almost as if it was written by someone who had never been part of any society. The whole thing makes no sense, it's almost nihilistic in the way that it redefines the framework of rules in film. Though, it has been claimed by the staff to be deliberately terrible. This was something quickly admitted to. However, I'm not truly sure that it was intentionally this awful. I think that there was a fair bit of effort put into it, certainly by Wiseau. Whatever the belief, this film manages to do everything horribly wrong, nothing about this, not one scene was something that I thought was lucid. It is a burning trainwreck of awfulness. But amongst the rubble it leaves you amazed at the sheer level of ineptness that you have just witnessed. It leaves you with a need to watch it again. Overall, The Room is a piece of genius that only a severely mentally ill person could ever create and pull off to the level that Wiseau has.",

It did not disappoint. I haven't laughed this much since the last time I saw \"Showgirls\". And don't believe the marketing campaign of it being a \"black comedy\". This new marketing strategy only came about after preview audiences were howling with laughter at the then promoted-as-a-drama-movie. The only thing \"black\" about this movie is the big, nasty stench left on the screen long after the projector has been shut off. It's pointless to even go into the \"plot\" because what little there is of one borders on surrealism due to  its inept unfolding. And even though Mr. Wiseau was at the screening, he failed to delight us with a Q & A session after the film finished.And I must commend Mr. Wiseau for a great job of getting his friends to leave an astounding amount of great reviews and \"10\" ratings to this board. \"The best San Francisco cinematography since 'Vertigo'\". Oh, they must be talking about the shot-on- a-Hollywood-soundstage-roof-shots-done-with-bluescreen-and-foggy-San- Francisco-badly-super-imposed-into-the-background.Mr. Wiseau, if you are rich, and you must have been to fund this film, please please please use your passion for cinema and fat wallet to produce, and leave the creative parts to people with a modicum of talent.And for lovers of bad cinema everywhere, see this film at any cost. And pray to the gods of cinema that we will be blessed with a release on dvd soon, so we can enjoy this masterpiece over and over and over...and if the gods are in a generous mood, might we also get \"director's\" commentary....a blooper reel....or is that too much to ask?",

Without the context of 'star' Greg Sestero's 'making of' memoirs, \"The Room\" would be challenging to sit through. The film opens like a 'soft core porn' flic (reminding me of Showcase's semi-adult (and almost as unwatchable) \"Red Shoe Diaries\", 1992) but goes nowhere in the erotic department (although starlet Juliette Danielle shows a lot more skin than the film \"The Disaster Artist\" (2017) suggests). After the titillating opening scenes, the movie degenerates into a disjointed, almost plotless, tale of love, betrayal, and footballs. Having seen \"The Disaster Artist\" and read some of the on-line comments, I watched \"The Room\" with rapt attention, waiting for the iconic \"Hi Mark\"s, \"best friend\"s, neck lumps, BB guns, doggies, and (of course) footballs. This scrutiny doesn't make the movie better, but does make for interesting viewing and gives insights into how much craft must go into making a 'good movie'. Oddly, IMO some scenes might have been excellent in other circumstances (four buddies in rented tuxedos, stressed-out while waiting for a wedding to begin, retreat to an alley for an impromptu game of football could have been a memorable scene in the \"The Deer Hunter\" (1978)). Auteur, star, and bank-roll Tommy Wiseau is as interesting as the film itself and, of all the reviews that I have written on IMDB, this one is the most likely to be read by the reviewed film's director. Lacking the quirky goofiness or bloody excesses of legendary 'bad/cult' movies' (such as \"Plan 9 from Outer Space\" (1959), \"Two Thousand Maniacs!\" (1964), or \"The Giant Claw\" (1957)), \"The Room\" would have sunk into the abyss of forgotten movies if not for \"The Disaster Artist\". Now, the film is celebrated as a cult film in its own right and, with one film, Wiseau may have become this generation's Ed Wood. *I think, but there are more than 100 reviews of the film on IMDB that date from before the 2013 publication of Sestero's book.",

            "content": "It takes a special kind of terrible movie to be this magical. From the moment Tommy Wiseau's odd character walks onto the screen, you're hooked from start to finish.Starring as Johnny, Tommy Wiseau's acting is majestic in its awfulness as he awkwardly recites his lines in a manner that is not dissimilar to a computerized voice rereading your typed words back to you in a profoundly hilarious and incomprehensible fashion. To describe Tommy as robotic or wooden would be an understatement, but the absolute lack of any acting ability is what makes his performance so engaging. I won't even go into his habit of letting out borderline creepy subtle laughs at the most inappropriate of times. That is something else entirely, and it is just another piece of the confusingly hilarious and mind-meltingly unsolvable puzzle that is Tommy Wiseau. To see Tommy attempting to act his way through this movie is like watching a baby take its first steps. It's an adorable disaster that you will never forget.Tommy's co-stars aren't any better in their awfulness. Johnny's on-screen best friend is Mark, a Sears catalogue model who fumbles through his lines with a curious lack of commitment and has a propensity for violently slamming young men into stacks of garbage cans. Johnny's fianc\u00e9e, Lisa, is a deeply disturbed woman with a habit of removing her clothes at random. Lisa may or may not be a sadistic sociopath due to her unreasonable and almost unpredictable behaviour in this jewel of a movie.Last but not least of the main characters... is Denny. Denny is the teenage neighbour of Johnny and Lisa who has an almost creepy obsession with Lisa. Denny wants nothing more than to watch Johnny and Lisa have intercourse, or to kiss Lisa. These dark fantasies are shared with his friend Johnny, who seems oddly at ease with the boy's disturbingly abnormal tendencies. Even when Denny jumps and rolls around on the bed with Johnny and Lisa in their pre-intercourse shenanigans, playfully exclaiming that he 'wants to watch', everyone is frighteningly okay with the boy. Denny also has a drug addiction problem, which results in one of the movie's most delightful scenes involving a screaming drug dealer who just may be the best actor in the movie. Do note that I state this fact quite joyously, because the acting in this movie really is tremendously bad in the most beautiful way imaginable.I don't dare spoil the movie's main plot between Johnny and Lisa, nor will I even dare mention the delightful performance given by the actress portraying Lisa's mother (it is just so beautiful in its awfulness). This movie is just such a glorious train wreck that defies logic and must not be spoiled! The Room is, undoubtedly, the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life. Despite this, it somehow manages to be unforgettable in its awfulness and remains more memorable in my mind than the greatest of Hollywood offerings. Imagine if the worst movies by Ed Wood and Uwe Boll had a baby together and starred an army of robots that had the acting parameters of Hayden Christensen installed into them. Even that description fails to capture the magical essence of The Room. This movie is terrible, make no mistake, but it is almost beautiful in its awfulness.This movie needs to be watched by anyone and everyone, simply because this is a one of a kind movie that perfectly captures everything that can go wrong with the production of a movie. We will never see its kind again - (oh, hi) mark my words.",

The Room has become a cult hit and now is shown in theaters where people yell and laugh at the movie, and really the unintentional humor is all this thing has going for it. The acting is just awful, especially from Wiseau, the direction is strange, as is the writing and the awful soap opera synth music. Everything about this movie is laughable, so it's good people have realized this, and Mr. WIseau has made a name for himself in the Ed Wood department.Johnny (Tommy Wiseau) is a successful banker who is engaged to his \"beautiful\" \"future wife\" Lisa (Juliette Danielle). She is cheating on Johnny for Johnny's well intentioned best friend Mark (Greg Sestero), who knows the whole situation is wrong. Also in the mix is Denny (Phillip Haldiman), a semi-retarded 18 year old who lives in the same apartment as the other characters. He gets into a pickle with a drug dealer. And Lisa's whiny mother Claudette (Carolyn Minnott) has breast cancer. And Lisa's friend and her boyfriend are making whoopee in Johnny's apartment while they are away. All these great sub-plots...none of which have any outcome on the film. Very strange!Discontinuity is one of the biggest problems with this movie. Many sub-plots are introduced and then immediately dropped, including those mentioned above. Character traits are introduced and then forgotten, like Johnny's dislike for drinking alcohol, which is immediately ignored. Along with scripted discontinuity, there's plenty of bad editing to be found, where characters mouths don't match what they're saying, and where the characters bounce around the screen and inanimate objects move about the room. One character who is never introduced appears and begins yelling at Lisa, and the question pops up, \"Who the heck is this guy?\" But we never get the luxury of knowing his name. All we know is that he must be friends of theirs or something.This movie is also notorious for it's horrible scriptwriting. Every time anybody sees anyone else they always say in a surprised way \"Oh, hi (insert name here)!\" This phrase must be used forty times in the movie. In addition strange and bizarre non-phrases are used, such as the ever popular phrase, \"Leave your stupid comments in your pocket!\" This film is riddled with nonsensical dialogue, and pointless scenes, and that's one thing that makes this such a hilarious film, is it's complete lack of sense.Acting is another aspect that isn't this movie's strong point. Tommy Wiseau is undoubtedly the worst actor in the film, giving a bizarre droopy eyed performance where he not only gives bad readings, but makes some of the ugliest and most stupid faces you could imagine. Greg Sestero is a better actor but still not good. He seems to be a soap opera character, and reading that he has appeared in soap operas that makes sense. Phillip Haldiman's portrayal of Denny is probably second worst in the film. The character is absolutely idiotic and a complete perv, and the acting just makes the character all the more pathetic. Despite this film's weakness (everything about it!), this is really a funny movie if you can appreciate horrible cinema. This thing is just awful start to finish, and it definitely will have you at least smirking through most of it!My rating: BOMB out of ****. 99 mins. R for constant sexuality, language and violence.",

I went to Stan Lee's LA ComicCon in 2017 and I'd get to meet Tommy Wiseau, I thought he was a cool guy. How I met him there was that I was at his aisle and I never thought a filmmaker would sell copies of his script and I was trying to decide (even that it's tough) and I also was telling him that I'm not sure if whether or not if I want to buy a copy of the script and I also thought it was nice for him to have me read the script as I'm deciding.

            "content": "Oh hi, Reader.What can I say that hasn't already been said about The Room? This movie is appalling...and yet I can't look away. I've watched it a dozen times and have shown it to anyone I can pin down in front of a screen. It's amazing, and yet it's so utterly dreadful. Shabby acting, poorly thought out scenes, non-existent plot, laughable soundtrack - it has it all!Others have mentioned some great moments in this epic, but my personal choices of highlights to watch-out for are: (1) Lisa's ever-expanding waistline. She begins as an attractive, fresh-faced girl but as the movie progresses she clearly gives up, stop combing her hair and pulls a chair up to the catering table for comfort. By the end she looks like a bag-lady. And who did her make-up? John Wayne Gacy?(2) The actor playing Mark who, in one scene on the roof-top with Johnny, displays a moment of the most amazing self-realisation (and self-disgust), as the penny finally drops what a pile of poo he's performing in. It's clearly not him acting because up to this point he's been out-performed by the furniture.(3) The character of Denny (who has to be one of the creepiest creatures ever committed to celluloid outside of a Stephen King movie)has many moments, but it's his sideways slide into rooms that amuses me most. Apparently the doors don't open more than halfway in Wiseauland.So many quotable lines, so many memorable moments, never a dull moment. Johnny's over-sized suits, the sex scenes that were as alluring as dental surgery, the jaw-dropping misogyny, the complete lack of understanding of social interaction between humans, the songs about running through a forest of flames..... What a film.",

It is the pinnacle of so bad it's good movies, but is that really an accomplishment? Some of the scenes where so poorly done that I couldn't breathe for laughter. The plot is nearly nonexistent and would be incredibly boring if it weren't so inept.I knew what I was watching was possibly one of the most incompetent things in existence, yet it was curiously entertaining. Would a one star rating really make sense to give if I enjoyed myself during this? Would a ten star rating really be appropriate for a film that only manages to be enjoyable due to failing on every conceivable level? I can't decide what the point of either would be, and there is no evidence as to whether or not this was intentional. Signs point to that it isn't.In conclusion, The Room receives no star rating, as it is impossible to rate something for failing at something it can hardly be said to qualify as. Still, you might enjoy it... if you're drunk.",

Ever since 2003, this film has been described as the \"Citizen Kane of bad movies\" for it's laughable dialogue, atrocious acting, generic cinematography, questionable plot points, and for having possibly the worst actor of all time....besides Neil Green, Tommy Wiseau. Mr. Wiseau produced, wrote, directed, and even starred in this disaster piece of a motion picture, and while it fails in every conceivable way, the earnest passion that this guy put into his movie is so fascinating that it makes the movie almost an inner psyche of the guy. From the moment he started speaking, you know that he has no idea how to act, but he still goes with it and it's a masterpiece of failure.I would go on about this, but I don't need to, everyone has gone about it. This movie has become a cultural phenomenon, from midnight screenings, to internet reviewers imitating Wiseau religiously, to even a book \"The Disaster Artist\" detailing the making of the film and the life of Tommy Wiseau and Greg Sister, the guy who plays Mark. Heck, the book was adapted to the screen by James Franco and friends and will come out in December of this year, so get excited for that. So yeah, this film fails in every way despite so much care put into it, and that's why I love it with all my heart.",

This is probably why the movie failed. Tommy delivers an incredibly bad an unemotional performance, the supporting cast are as well nearly just as bad, though this could simply be done to Wiseaus directing and producing.Next is the repetitive scenes over and over again, for example when we keep seeing Johnnys girlfriend (I forget her name because she was so dull) talking to her mother, this must happen about 5 times throughout the movie, and they keep talking about the same thing! Finally, the randomness sometimes of this movie is terrible, for example we have a scene in which Johnny and his friends go out and play football ALL the time... But it gets worse... There is one scene where they go and play American football in tuxedos FOR NO REASON, this is never explained.In conclusion this is a very bad experience, Tommy has tried to advertise this movie everywhere, there are even some rumours surrounding where he got the funds for the movies. Also, on some occasions it has been said when it came out Tommy said it was a Black Comedy though recently he has called it a serious drama... tut tut tut... I never liked one whole scene throughout this whole movie, it was badly directed, produced and written, one of the worst movies ever created.I urge every one not to read a lot of the 8-10 star reviews of this movie it is probably Tommy Wiseau sitting in his rented flat at 2am in the morning telling everyone about his 'amazing' creation.",

I'm far more offended by accomplished directors with years of experience who turn out true garbage, like how Spielberg ruined the end of A.I. or Coppola's dreary, miserable flop One From The Heart. The temptation to comprehend the mind of the director is overwhelming in good entertainment, or the aforementioned accomplished directors who turn out crap, but it's almost overpowering in this film. This isn't a film, it's a peek inside the mind of a mysterious man who has a very complicated view of the world; on that basis alone it should be feted. This is art in its purest form, unencumbered by convention, preconceived notions, propriety, morality, or continuity. And the fact that the incompetence appears unintentional makes the experience of watching it all the more worthwhile. Sometimes you just have to say enough with the precise lighting, post-production dubbing, million-dollar soundtracks, and the endless parade of phony inflated hollywood egos and embrace some irreverence from an outsider for a change.",

            "content": "This is a movie filled with friendship, betrayal, lust and sports. All compacted into a masterpiece of a film with unique characters and so much emotions. Yeah, this is probably my first time using sarcasm in this review, mainly because this whole movie seemed like a giant ball of sarcasm. Tommy Wiseau is either a genius (well someone that knew what he was doing) and wanted to go in a black comedy direction or a hack of a director that really tried to make a serious drama. Like he knew the main drive of this movie is himself playing Johnny with the most corny and awful acting ever. What shocked me the most about this movie is how he was able to raise 6 million dollars for this so called movie. He probably pocked just about all of it, seeing how this movie seems like something made from a shoe string budget of less than 2 grand. During a interview Tommy Wiseau mentioned that he intentionally made a bad movie on purpose that would stand out from the rest. In my opinion it can go both ways. Watching this movie is like watching the movie \"I Am a Sex Addict\" except even worse, but better at the same time, if that makes sense. This is a movie you just have to go with, without taking it seriously in order to get a bit of entertainment out of for all the wrong reason. This movie came out in 2003, but looks like something from the 60's. Everything and everyone in this movie is just super awkward, especially with the interactions amongst one another. I just recently saw this movie called \"Joe\" which is actually a good movie and I can see the similarity between the characters Joe and Johnny to a certain degree. Both are the good-intentioned characters that tries to take care of a youngster, except Johnny throughout the whole movie with the plot and all tries to prove how much of a good guy he is and how everyone is scummy. He however comes across as those supposed nice guys that gets annoying really quickly, except he is so freaking weird and odd that actually makes him unique in a sense. Tommy or Johnny is someone that oozes with some much cheese and grease that it makes everything he says and does hysterical in a sense. There are cheesy and greasy characters in other movies before, but for this case it just didn't seem intentional. Especially see how Tommy Wiseau seems to be a bit on the narcissistic side without taking things too seriously. This is a movie that you just have to watch with a crowd to get the most effect out of. Because this is a movie that the audiences can participate with and makes it their own and recite phrases while having fun with it. This also has probably the worst sex scenes I have ever seen in a movie so far and the super cheesy and melodramatic music playing the in background makes it all cringe-worthy. It's just something very very very difficult to watch. The cinematography is awful, the acting is equally as awful (it seemed like the actors and actresses knew how bad this movie is thus couldn't take it seriously), the plot and characters is inconsistent, doesn't make any sense and just plain downright dumb. Just don't take anything in this movie seriously and watch it with a crowd and play along with it, you just might have a good time with this. Cause I will probably never ever watch this movie by myself ever. I give this movie a 4.5 by combining the score of this movie as a movie and from the entertainment you can get by roasting it and playing along with a crowd.4.5/10",

            "content": "by mindselfThere are a lot of horrendous things in this world. Some of it we can tolerate and some of it is demeaning. But what if it's something we can enjoy and have fun with? What if it's the film The Room?The film stars Tommy Wiseau, who also directed, written, and is the producer of, and it's about Wiseau character, Johnny, struggle and realization that he's caught up in a love triangle \u2013 and that's basically it. Really though, that's basically it. The film has a cult following as being the worst film ever made and you know what? They're right. Not only is it poorly directed, written and produce, it's also poorly thought out. That's the enjoying factor of it though. Like people say, no one goes out and make bad films purposely and I don't think Wiseau was intended to do so but this film is created like film 101.First off, there's far too many sex scenes. The first four minutes into the film, you get a long and unflattering sex scene that's also very fanciful and amateurish. It makes Showtime channel's softcore porn look first-class. There's about four sex scenes that bares an unattractive woman and an unusual male rear end. Not tantalizing at all. Also during each sex scene there's horrible R&B music that seem to come out of the era of the 90s. This was made in 2003.The actors seem to do a decent job \u2013 no not really, they're horrible too. There are no major stars just the usual up and coming actors and actress trying to make a buck. I mean, I can't act but I know when someone is trying, they seem like they're reading their lines instead of acting it out. I guess that's the joy of it though. Each scene is open when someone enters the room and ends when someone leaves the room. The dialogue comes as being very clich\u00e9 and awful. Here are excerpts from the film:Conversation between Johnny (Wiseau) and his best friend Mark (Sestero):Mark: How was work today? Johnny: Oh pretty good. We got a new client\u0085 at the bank. We make a lot of money. Mark: What client? Johnny: I can not tell you, its confidential. Mark: Oh come on. Why not? Johnny: No I can't. Anyway, how is your sex life?Here's another between Johnny and his 'future wife' Lisa (Danielle):Lisa: Did you get your promotion? Johnny: Nah. Lisa: You didn't get it, did you.As you can tell some of the the dialogue is also condescending and cringeworthy. Again, that's the enjoyment of the film. It takes itself too seriously that it's so funny. There's countless unintentional humor in this film. Whether that be the character of the awkward Denny, who I have no idea why he's in the film, to the numerous times of playing catch with a football (you'll see) everything is design as if he wanted to make the worst film of all time. I don't know if he intended to do so, but if it was, then the film would lose it's magic. It's great because it's bad, very bad. I would love to go into great detail but I really want you to watch it. I recommend the film just because it needs to be watch once in your life. You'll probably regret it, but I'm sure you'll have a couple of chuckles.I had this thesis that this film is a huge metaphor. Lisa is \"The Room\" and Johnny is the \"audience\". Go in with that thought and it might blow your mind, literally.SPOON!!!!! (you'll know what I mean when you watch it)",

Mr. Wiseau is a LOUSY film maker but I'm guessing a pretty decent business man since he is trying to capitalize on the cult following by trying to convince people (and the simple minded just might buy it)that his intention was to make a comedy (he has a website selling merchandise!). Sorry, those who got a 6 or better on their SATs will never buy it. It's, pretty much as everyone else has said, such a horrible movie, it's GREAT! I loved it and that queasy feeling I got at the beginning of watching this movie with my son (Who is a HUGE fan of bad cinema) went away once I really started to laugh.There are well over 300 reviews, so mine will get lost in the shuffle. My main concern is coming to the defense of Ms. Juliette Danielle. She's not a great actress (though with better material, I have faith she'll be pretty good!) but I have to vehemently disagree with all those who don't find her attractive. Beauty is judged differently by us all, and personally, I think she's adorable. In fact I spent most of the movie wondering just why in hell such a cutie would have ever fallen for a guy who looks 20 years older and near death in the first place. Go figure.In conclusion, I hope this talentless hack, Tommy Wiseau NEVER makes another movie because next time, he'll TRY to make it funny, and it'll fall flat on it's face. Then again, this is a free country, do what you must.*In the above review I mentioned that Tommy Wiseau might try to make an actual comedy and it would fail. HE DID and IT DID! If you like hysterically bad crap, find \"The Neighbors\" somewhere. You'll laugh like hell, but NOT for the right reasons, or should I say, the reasons he WANTS you to laugh, just for the reasons it's legitimately funny. It's worse than \"The Room\" and funnier.",

For me Urban Menace is a for more worser film, a film so bad it has no redeeming qualities.Even Plan 9 From Outer Space is worse.I think a lot of people are told what to like and dislike by the media & the internet (the average Rocky Horror Picture Show is a case in point.) People watch The Room 30 times? Is that because they feel they have to to fit in with the crowd? I give this 5 stars...the endless love making scenes were terrible and I found Lisa a bore but for me every scene with Tommy Wiseau made this DVD worthwhile.He reminds me of Christopher Walken's talentless brother who can't act or direct.The end scene with him is marvelous.I would recommend this film, it made me laugh a lot but as Chuck D said : Don't believe the hype!",

Thank you Mr. Jimmym, your review actually set loose a bit of that Wiseaunian wtf syndrome back to me, it was almost like watching bits of the movie for the second time.Second of all, I loved this movie. Yes, I gave it a 10 star rating. Yes, I would do it again if I was just watching the movie for the first time. Yes, I am serious. This is in no way a mocking business.Third of all, thanks Mr. Wiseau for existing. I will not write any spoilers, for I'm afraid someone might bump into them accidentally, and that could ruin someone's experience. All I want to say is, if there is such a thing as a religious experience, watching \"The Room\" is the closest to that I'll ever get. It is a whole new dimension of being, feeling, existing. Could it be the twilight zone? Could God have come to earth? Could I be closer to something? Further away? These are all good questions, and there are no final answers for them. Therefore, these questions don't really matter. What matters is, I never felt so closer to myself and so further away at the same time. I often felt like I was watching a movie with aliens that were trying desperately hard to imitate human's life, but couldn't, or failed for a bit. There's something that's off, but I can't pinpoint it, I can't put my finger on it and say \"this is what's wrong!\": and that's the beauty of it. Mr. Wiseau was right, on an interview he gave about \"The Room\": you have to watch this movie at least twice, you won't understand it the first time. I've seen \"The Room\" 5 times now, and I still cannot explain in words the way I feel, nor can I explain what the movie really is, or what it is really about. Mr. Wiseau also tells us that this movie is meant to teach us something, to teach us to be better persons because, quoting \"If I lot of people loved each other, the world would be a better place.\" I am not sure if watching \"The Room\" made me a better person. Although, I can honestly say, it has made me a happier person. And that my friends, is a precious beautiful gift. Let's hold on to this happiness forever and rejoice in it. May Mr. Wiseau be in our thoughts. Amen.",

As one reviewer said before me there is only one word to describe it \"CRAPTASTIC\" so bad it's good. But even when laughing I STILL hated it, since it JUST MADE NO SENSE!Perhaps this was a foreigner's IDEA of what American life was. I really can't figure out this crapfest. The funny parts were \"YOU'RE TEARING ME APART LISA!!!!\" \"CHEEP CHEEP CHEEP\" The whole preggo part \"WHY LISA WHY!?\" The television breaking The ending!OMG I almost forgot those horrid make out scenes, Why Tommy why? lmao",

            "content": "I recently had the pleasure of seeing The Room on the big screen and meeting Tommy Wiseau in person for the second time! Why did I go to this event? Because watching The Room with an audience that knows it is a terrible movie is one of the best experiences in the world. Unfortunately all the noise was too much for a friend of mine, but the rest of us in the audience nearly lost our voices shouting at the screen for the duration of the film.This may be an oxymoron, but everything I love about the film is everything I hate about the film. Maybe I shouldn't use the word hate, because the fact that this film is so terrible does not give me a negative attitude for the movie - it makes me laugh at how ridiculous of a guy Tommy Wiseau really is. The writing is so atrocious it makes us want to keep quoting it and laughing at it. Such favorite lines among fans include \"Keep your stupid comments in your pocket!,\" \"Anyway, how's your sex life?,\" and of course, \"YOU ARE TEARING ME APART LISA!\"The best part about this film is that Tommy Wiseau gives a terrible performance and acts as though he doesn't understand the lines, which HE wrote! He doesn't sound like a normal human being having a conversation, but he wrote his own part as this average citizen and a caretaker of Denny (who he kept saying was retarded at the event I went to) so you'd imagine he'd talk like an average American. Well guess what, Tommy is far from the average American himself, so how could his character come across as an average guy? Wiseau is like the only real-life cartoon character I have ever met, which is why this film turns out to be so hilarious!If you watch this film, watch it with at least a few friends - a large group of friends would be better. If you find yourself enjoying how terrible of a movie it is, I highly encourage you to try to find an event near your hometown where Wiseau will stop as he tours the country with his film - that is the true experience for this masterpiece tragedy.3.0/4.0",

            "content": "Where ever Tommy Wiseau grew up (a subject of some debate) he heard that America is the land of opportunity. A place where dreams can come true. And oh yes, Tommy had a dream. Tommy wanted to be an actor, a star. To one day appear on the Silver Screen in his own movie, Tommy's movie, made Tommy's way. He came to America and struggled but he never once let go of that dream. And he realized that if he pretended to be what he wanted to be, eventually he might get there. And somehow, despite everything being against him, Tommy succeeded and starred in his very own film. He brought his artistic vision into reality and put every bit of talent and ambition he had, nay his very SOUL, onto that screen. Tommy bravely never let anything get in the way of his goals. Total lack of talent, basic filmmaking ability, basic understanding of his adopted culture, the ability to speak the language of his new adopted home in a comprehensible manner? Mere obstacles to be bludgeoned out of the way in whatever way possible.Tommy Wiseau is the living, breathing embodiment of the American Dream. He set out to make a classic, and he succeeded. \"The Room\" may not be the classic Tommy INTENDED to make, but he tried. And one thing about America is undeniable, we respect those that try. And in that \"The Room\" may very well be the perfect American film. So watch \"The Room\" and shed a patriotic tear for a man and a film that ONLY America could have produced. A film as unique as the man who made it.",

            "content": "With a movie about the making of The Room coming out, I thought I'd break down and watch it. I cheated and watched it with RiffTrax, though, in case the unintentional comedy aspect failed on me.The movie is a fascinating curio that is inept to a level that is hard to even describe. It's not just the broad strokes, like the inane story or the hanging subplots or the abysmal acting. It's also the moment to moment directorial choices. For example, in a scene involving a loan shark, Lisa gets upset and reacts with over-the-top emotion. But in the cutaways to the actor she's talking to, his emotional tone doesn't jibe and it's not clear they are working from the same script. This is pretty common in the movie.It's not just that director/writer/star Wiseau has no concept of the language of film but that he doesn't seem to understand how people work. He's like a robot who has tried to figure out human interactions and failed abysmally. There is not a moment where anyone does anything a real person would do in the same circumstances. None of the characters make sense, none of the actions make sense. While famous bad-film-director Ed Wood seemed to understand what a movie was supposed to look like, even if he couldn't make it happen, Wiseau appears to have lived alone in a box his entire life.Well, not quite, because one gets the impression that Wiseau is mad at someone he dated. Lisa is basically a psychopath, suggesting that Wiseau thinks women are just plain out to get him. Would this have been funny without RiffTrax? I'm not sure. Some things, like the plentiful, tedious, *endless* sex scenes, are painful even with jokes in the background. Other times I could see where in the right mood I would laugh at the terribleness of it all.Anyway, *with* RiffTrax it's pretty fun, although I thought they were being unfair to the actress playing Lisa, who was undeserving of the body shaming lines.",

with scenes that offer nothing, shots that are reused, plots that go nowhere and to tie it all together, there is characters who deliver lines like they are about to go in for heart surgery and realize that they have no chance of surviving itit's not the worst movie I've ever seen....there's so many worse movies than this - but it's so devoid of any real story because of all the little stories thrown in that go nowhere and because the dialogue is so plain and uninterestingthis is like a first draft script with no other thought given to it and then filmed with whoever showed up for the casting call and with just people with little to no experience in the entire development of the filmthis is a masterpiece in filmmaking - because there is next to no direction or real effort put into making this - and it showsthe total lack of investment in all areas because of it's devoid sense of story make this a feast to watchthe budget could have been 200 million and it still would not have been any better -

an actor so devoid of any charm, conviction, emotion or interest in any capacitythe story revolves around Johnny - who should be the very most interesting person in the film - and is certainly not...Johnny staggers into a door with almost no reason to walk into the room or anywhere else...his eyes look like he saw the most depressing thing everit doesn't even change when he gets angry or when he's getting ;aid or any other time...there's next to no range of emotion from Johnny -

but there's something that makes you want to watch it and just to see how bland and pointless it all becomesthat's not necessarily a bad thing...many film makers will never end up making a movie that will be remembered as good as The Room is...with hundreds of thousands of movies made on a yearly basis in the United States alone - most movies will neve get the attention that this movie does - yet most movies will be better made, with a better story, better cast, better scenery and everything else...they may be better, they may have a bigger budget - but even those 200 million dollar budget movies are missing something that makes them so special...and that is what The Room has...nobody knows exactly what makes The Room so special - because it's very poorly pieced together - but in't it's total mess - there is that unique thing that even many big budget block busters will never have...no Star Wars movies, no Terminator movies, no action movies, no dramas - not the best movies ever made have that special thing that makes The Room so unique....and nobody knows what it is....only Tommy Wiseau knowsso while this movie is a jumble of mishaps, it's an interesting piece...sort of like a Picasso painting in a comic book shop...it doesn't fit in with anything else around it, but it fits in by itself...and stands outso, you can laugh and mock it for everything that it's not - because it's missing so much - but then you have to admire that fact that as bad as it is...as devoid of anything captivating...it's a work of art in it's own wayit's the 300 million dollar Picasso painting in a collection of comic books...it is totally out of place, but it's still a work of art...I don't hate this movie at all...it's not my favourite film in any respect either...but as bad as it is, it does not deserve a 1...and I don't rate it a 10 because it's the best film ever made...far from it...but it deserves a 10 because it's a collective mess with no inspiration, a uninspired cast, a devoid plot, poorly performed cast, edited by a blind person and through all that...it's an accomplished work of artit's the ultimate American Dream...a person who set their goals to do something, get it done and then set it out to the world - only to be mocked and disputed as being no good - when the person behind it all went to great lengths to not only think of it, but to complete it all with his own money, do his own promotion and see it through to the endas bad s it is, there's something undeniably interesting about The Room that not too many good or bad movies have...I've seen bad movies....really bad movies -

            "content": "Ne day when I was at work, I was having a conversation with a coworker about bad movies. The \"best worst movie\" Troll 2 (known internationally as Goblins) came up. He mentioned a movie called The Room. I told him that the movie \"Best Worst Movie\" was made about Troll 2 and has the distinction of being \"the worst\". He then went on to tell me about the (then) upcoming movie The Disaster Artist, which chronicles the making of this shit storm.He told me about the movie itself and I was compelled to see it. I've read about it on IMDb and Wikipedia and it sounded awful. I made it my mission to see this.\nI finally procured a copy and I'm now indulging in it as I write this. Where can I possibly begin?There's a sex scene just after the four-minute mark. Everything else is almost laugh-out-loud bad. The acting, the music, the grunting and moaning. Everything.\nIt's difficult to write this because the writing in this is beyond anything I've ever experienced. Calling it atrocious would be kind. To top it off, the camera goes out of focus periodically. Apparently, nobody bothered to check the lens, so this is a thing.My God. Seventeen minutes in and so far there's been nothing but some minor dialogue and two sex scenes. Both scenes have horrible music and at the second one, the actors voices are dubbed over the music. You hear HIM say \"Oh Lisa\", but they're KISSING. This is like a bad porn movie from the early eighties (not the sex, the music).I have over an hour left of this appalling film. Check this out...I LITERALLY have to use a thesaurus because of how mind-boggling terrible this is.\nI'm pausing it at times to get my thoughts straight. Back to the bad sex scene.\nThe lines are forced and the \"acting\" is wooden.Wow. Fuck me.I appreciate Tommy Wiseau wanting to write, direct, produce, and star in his own movie. Independent filmmakers are among the people that I look up to the most. The greatest of them all is Roger Corman. He is (as far as I'm concerned) the Patron Saint of independent filmmakers. He's produced over 400 films, directed over 50, and turned a profit on almost every one (give or take a dozen or so).\nTommy Wiseau is the modern day Ed Wood. That's actually an insult to Mister Wood because at least he had vision. If he had the budget that he needed, his films would have been science fiction masterpieces and not the schlockfests that they are.Robert Rodriguez (like Tommy Wiseau) financed his first film independently. That was a little film called El Mariachi. That got so popular that it spawned two sequels (Desperado and Once Upon A Time In Mexico). Robert Rodriguez is FUCKING AMAZING. I may not be a fan of everything he does, but HE KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOING!!!!!Fuck! Only twenty minutes in.Okay, who in their right mind orders a pizza with \"half Canadian bacon and pineapple and half with artichoke and pesto, light on the cheese\"? Do these people even know what pizza is? An argument can be made for the bacon/pineapple, but who puts pesto on pizza? Maybe it's a thing and I'm being too critical.Apparently, much of the audio was dubbed which leads to the audio being out of sync.What the hell is this movie about? So far, it's been her having sex with two different guys, some pizza, and some horrific dialogue.Sadly, for me, the BEST part of this Godawful movie is Juliette Danielle. She's very pretty and I like her topless scene. Too bad the THREE sex scenes in the first HALF HOUR were unnecessary\n.\nBeing objective about the plot (from what I could gather), Lisa and Tommy are dating. He's her financial security and in line for a promotion. She no longer loves him and one day she gets him drunk and complains to her mother that he got drunk (he did) and that he hit her (he didn't). There's also this annoying kid named Denny who shows up at unnecessary times.It looks like it's supposed to be about relationships, but there's NOTHING cohesive about this movie. There's a scene where Denny runs afoul of a drug dealer and the interaction with everyone is reprehensible. Lisa and her mom suddenly show up off camera and Johnny takes the drug dealer to the police, but the time it would take to actually do that isn't represented properly. He comes back about a minute later.The CLOSEST thing I can get to a plot is as follows: Johnny and Lisa are lovers. He comes home and they have sex. Johnny's ward Denny wants to hang out with them, but they send him away so they can have sex. After he leaves for the day, she calls his best friend Mark and seduces him and they sleep together. After he comes home, they drink and have pizza, and then have sex again.Lisa complains to her mother that she no longer loves Johnny and gets yelled at because she can't support herself. On a rooftop, Denny gets into an altercation with a drug dealer that gets interrupted by Johnny and Mark. Later on that rooftop, Denny confesses his love for Lisa to Johnny. Johnny says that he trusts her, meanwhile Lisa brags to her friend about how she's sleeping with Mark.\nThe way people show up in this is like a bad sitcom. In fact, a laugh track would probably make this better.Earlier, I said that Tommy Wiseau was in league with Ed Wood. I was incorrect. The directors that are in the same category as him are: Paul W. S. Anderson, Vincent Gallo, and the infamous Uwe Boll.Not everyone should make movies and this is proof. It's further proof that if you don't know what you're doing, you should ask for help. There's no shame in that. Pride is a bad servant and a worse master.I feel that this review is a bit irreverent, but that's appropriate given the fact that this movie falls about fifty yards short of making any kind of sense.Currently, I have about a half hour left and this movie has gone nowhere. There isn't a single character that I care about. The plot tries to make it out of the jumbled mess that is this movie. Sadly, there's only been four terrible sex scenes that are forced upon us. Only two are necessary for the plot to move forward and while I appreciate nudity, it's unnecessary in this. This would have been better as a made-for-TV movie on Lifetime.The most ironic thing about this film is that there's no aforementioned \"Room\". According to Tommy Wiseau, the title is meant to evoke a safe place for viewers. Realistically, the BEST place for viewers is far away from this monstrous creation.I'm giving this 1 out of 5 reasons why you shouldn't let your curiosity get the best of you.",

The acting is pretty much all around atrocious, our \"lead\" is just horrific...HORRIFIC...he brandishes his lines like a child with a sword, jumping from complete and utter ambiguous detachment \"everything will be fine\" to completely off key bursts of anger.

The tradition started with Plan 9 from Outer Space and moved through Manos Hands of Fate, Attack of the Killer Tomatoes and, in the modern day, Sharknado.It is not totally clear if this movie, The Room, falls into that category--it is so bad that you wonder if perhaps the director has a secret genius and is doing a spoof of said movies, or if his psycho-\"drama\" love-triangle flick is just an earnest attempt at real cinema. Probably the latter, since the dialogue, story and characters of this movie are so amateurish, so far-fetched, and so talent-less that it simply could not be. No spoof could be this brilliant. It is just horrible. The mounting \"tension\" as the love triangle gets ever more exposed and gives way to ever more ridiculous situations and acting, is a beautiful thing to behold, as it is executed with complete earnestness. We watch dumbfounded, and occasionally drawn into hysterical laughter.Which brings me to the main reason you should watch this movie. It is hilarious. And it gets funnier as it goes along. And at the end, without tripping the spoiler alert, I can tell you that the last scene is one of the funniest I have ever seen in any movie in my entire life. My son and I, when we watched it, were falling off of our chairs in tears and could barely avoid having an asthma attack, we were both laughing so hard. I never thought I would see a film that could surpass Plan 9 for its campy hideousness, but this is the grandaddy of them all.

Its only as the film goes on, if you can hang in there, that the individual awful elements (the acting, the sets, the script- oh the script) build and build to a level of almost hysterical terribleness. This film touches on major themes; betrayal, domestic violence, drug misuse and fatal illness, with so little insight, tact or intelligence that if it were a joke it would be tasteless. But its not a joke, this film is deadly serious, which makes it worse, much, much worse.See it, but don't try to understand the tuxedo scene, you wont'- nobody does.",

It's challenging to describe The Room. Yes, it is a terribly made movie, from every possible angle considered. And yes, it is terrible in a hilarious fashion, due in part to Johnny's extraordinary appearance, timing of delivery, accent, facial expressions, etc. What makes it better than other \"bad-funny\" movies, though, and even better than many \"real\" movies (yes), is that it excavates a small permanent space for itself in your brain upon the first viewing. You will be morbidly intrigued by producer/writer/director/lead actor Tommy Wiseau, not to mention his surrounding cast, and you will have many questions about the film. These questions will remain unanswered even upon repeated viewings. So you will scour the internet for anything you can find on Tommy or his film. His interviews will confuse you further. Every time he speaks, his words are so complex with oddities that you seriously don't know what to laugh at first. Tommy IS Johnny, or so it appears. This will lead to somewhat of an obsession, which is fine, as the film's cult following will welcome you. You will tell your friends about it, and each home screening will draw a larger crowd, but sometimes you will crave a solitary viewing late at night. And in some cases, you will even attend a public screening with a group of friends at your local theater tomorrow, with Tommy himself in attendance. Not many movies have this kind of impact, be it intentional or accidental. And that brings up another important question--was this movie a truly naive attempt at film, resulting in a purely accidental masterpiece? Or is it a masterfully crafted parody, so perfect in its subtlety that it masks Wiseau's wry comic ambition? You will ponder this question incessantly, thus exalting the movie to a platform of philosophical debate. Are we laughing at Tommy or is he laughing at us laughing at him? And if we are laughing AT him, does this make it a failure and/or make us mean spirited? Many comedies fail to make us laugh this hard at all. So regardless of how the laughs are achieved, this movie is undeniably a comedic success. Maybe we are just laughing at the movie's uncanny achievement and not at Tommy personally? And if the joke is on us, is it still funny? If this is the case, it's a brilliant satire of bad movies. Tommy wins either way. Perhaps this is the next frontier of comedy. Hiring rare, eccentric amateurs like Tommy to make serious films, and thereby effortlessly creating comedic gold. It'll be the next wave of reality TV. But for now, believe the hype and just see The Room. It generates the same personal reaction of awe and wonder that is usually reserved for the great classics of cinema. It is both entertaining and mind bending, in ways you'd never expect.",

            "content": "The Room is wildly regarded as one of the worst movies of all time. But boy, it may be one of the worsts but that still doesn't make it any less funny then it already is. It stars our main character, Johnny. Who is played by our lord and savior, Tommy Wiseau. But here's the kicker, Tommy Wiseau *barely* speaks English and talks with a really bad accent. Even when he attempts to be serious, his direction of his acting and voice is never portrayed correctly and offers some hilarious dialogue for all the wrong reasons. And for someone who also directed, written and produced the film, it comes off as a surprise. Anyways back to the \"plot\", Johnny lives in a Suburbian area in America I think, it's never explained where he lives. He lives with his future fianc\u00e9e, Lisa. Lisa is without a doubt, the worst human I've seen in a movie. Lisa is supposed to marry Johnny but it turns out she doesn't like him at all (I don't blame her, really). But the fact that she cheats on his \"best friend\" (which is Mark by the way), and lies about whatever Johnny did to her just makes me cringe. She also has some banter with her mother MULTIPLE TIMES in the movie, and it goes like this: \"Marry Johnny.\" \"No.\" \"Do it, ya' female dog!\" Like I said, this same conversation happens multiple times, and it NEVER gets ANY better. Don't even get me STARTED on the sex scenes... There's also this weird \"subplot\" where this kid \"Denny\" is buying drugs from some guy and nearly gets killed when Denny doesn't pay him back. And like most bad movies, this subplot NEVER goes anywhere afterwards. The arguments between Lisa and her mother along with the sex scenes go on and on until we finally go somewhere at the end where it's Johnny's birthday. For some weird reason, Lisa decides to have a go at Mark at the MIDDLE OF THE PARTY until some random person finds them. Johnny notices sometime through and we have some HILARIOUS dialogue with even more hilarious deliveries like \"I AM FED UP WITH THIS WIORLD!\". Johnny locks himself in a cupboard like a little kid and Lisa calls Mark to have sex...again when Johnny is literally in the NEXT ROOM. This causes Sudoku...I mean, suicide. Mark, Lisa and Denny notice this and cry until the ambulance or police come...my brain has melted. The biggest problem with the movie is that there's virtually no pacing, direction and even plot. But it's so damn hilarious that it gave itself a higher score then what I should get and hell, I recommend binge-drinking while watching it. But if you want a serious movie that is in a similar genre to this (I don't know what genre I'm thinking of), avoid this movie at all costs.",

            "content": "\"The Room\" is a modern cult classic for an audience who enjoys a good laugh from seeing a lackluster indie-film with numerous errors or quirks about it. Think \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\" audience without the garish makeup, dancing or singing. The writer/director/actor Tommy Wiseau would take the praise either way about the film.Essentially, the film is about love and betrayal, why attraction is more important to some than stability. Lisa (played by Juliette Danielle) is having second thoughts about marrying Johnny (played by the aforementioned Wiseau) and chooses to make a rash decision behind his back which affects a number of their friends and family. It's a simple plot, and the simple production makes you feel like you're watching a play or an after-school special about being truthful (if it wasn't for the nudity, it would be). The movie's original music was a nice addition, and it even had a theme made for the movie, which you hear at the beginning and somewhere in the middle. The rest of the music was underground R&B and thrown into the film during one of the four sex scenes and the credits.There are plenty of laugh-out-loud moments, mostly due to Wiseau's awkward delivery of his lines that he wrote and the painful delivery of most of the cast. Characters pop in and out of scenes at random and with strange motives, and some of Johnny's heartfelt emotional moments are cut short to say hi to his best friend, Mark. The chemistry between the cast makes them feel like strangers amongst one another, and some characters are downright goofy, making faces (Mike) and acting stupid and weird (Denny). There's even an entire scene that has no business in the movie (the drug dealer gone insane).Overall, the movie is meant for college parties and midnight screeners as a goof, not a masterpiece theater. It won an award somehow for an Audience Award of the Best Feature Film in the New York Int'l Indie Film & Video Festival, and I have to imagine there were plenty of tongue-in- cheek voters on that panel. By a quick read of the trivia found on this site, it sounds like Wiseau really poured his money, heart and ideas out there, but what it produced was as savory as a Jell-o dessert.",

Tommy Wiseau, the writer, director, producer, and star, has an indefinable screen presence, though no talent. The other actors are dull and mediocre. The laughs come from so many sources...the subplots that are introduced and never mentioned again, the prop inconsistencies, Tommy's terrible accent, the lines that were clearly dubbed in after the filming was done (out of sync with the lips), and the bizarre exchanges between characters. My personal favorite is when Mark tells Johnny a story about a girl he knew that would cheat, and got beat up by one of the guys so bad she ended up in a hospital, to which Johnny laughs heartily and replies, \"What a story, Mark!\" From beginning to end, this film is a train wreck you can't (and shouldn't) avert your eyes from.

And overall, it's not the worst thing I saw (I've viewed Ratatoing, and Foodfight!) but it's still pretty wretched. I will admit that the movie is kind of compelling in a way. I use that term lightly. It's pretty interestingly set up. Johnny has a fianc\u00e9e named Lisa, and they are getting married next month. Johnny is satisfied with his life, but Lisa is not. She decides that she doesn't love Johnny anymore, and has an affair with his best friend Mark. And that's basically the whole plot. And being fair, it was pretty intriguing. I was interested to see where it was going to lead. But apparently the writer/ producer/main character of the movie Tommy Wiseau got confused and threw different stories at us during the movie. And that brings me to my gripes about this movie. Here's a list: 1. Misunderstood character development 2. Scenes that try to add character development, and not only fail, but feel pointless during the movie. (Ex. Denny taking drugs, Claudette's breast cancer, etc.) 3. Repetitive scenes (We see Lisa talking to her mother numerous times, Lisa and Mark having sex, Mark, Jonny and Denny throwing a football around randomly, shots of San Francisco with the same music..... Must I go on?) 4. Tommy Wiseau cannot act. I'll just leave it at that. 5. Why are Johnny, Peter, Denny, and Mark playing football in their TUXEDOS?? 6. TOO MANY LONG SEX SCENES! I honestly think that Tommy Wiseau was trying to do a porn film. So with that being said, my favorite part was the ending. SPOILERS!!!! Lisa's affair is finally unearthed by Johnny, she leaves, then Johnny goes completely insane. Tearing the place apart and killing himself. It was the most intense and dramatic thing I saw, and I actually felt sorry for him afterwards. To wrap it up, I do recommend that you watch this movie at least once. It's bad, but it IS entertaining. RATING: 3/10",

Its like coming home from a hard day's work and finding your puppy has trashed up the house and made a horrible mess on the couch. You're furious but then you look at the puppy and you just find the anger leave you, You can't stay mad at it, look at it. The Room to me is like that.The Room is so bafflingly incompetent and without a hint of self awareness I can't help but be captivated by it. Everything in the movie is done wrong. The acting is laughably bad, The story and characters make no sense, the cinematography is bland, the costumes look like they came from a charity shop (because most of them did, seriously look it up!) And I've seen school plays with better set design. But I don't find the Room's incompetence insulting, if anything I find it charming. I can't recommend this movie enough It is without a doubt the funniest tragedy ever, it is the greatest unintentional comedy and it is both the best and worst movie ever made.

Nevertheless, I still found much of it quite funny, and it's hard not to with such a tremendous helping of incompetency on display: the stilted performances, obviously including Wiseau's own poorly-dubbed, awkwardly delivered (but in a different way every time) tour-de-force; the blatant green-screen; plot threads seemingly setup that then go nowhere (Lisa's mother had breast cancer, right?); random, unrelated establishing shots of locations that characters never visit (really gets a lot of mileage out of one clip of the Golden Gate Bridge); new people constantly appearing without introduction, then leaving just as soon (WHO IS MIKE?); the same three sets being used throughout; even the props are bizarre: stock photos of spoons framed around Johnny's home, and are they drinking Scotch topped with vodka? Needless to say, it's a bit of a mess, and certainly a monumental failure on every narrative level, if one can be so generous as to grant this film a narrative. Wiseau is the X-factor, the mysterious auteur at the centre of it all, a man whose accent is as unplaceable as his intentions, and as inexplicable as his budgetary sources. The self-aggrandisement is overwhelming, with every character insistent that \"Johnny\" is their best friend and the greatest guy you'll ever meet, always talking about him when he's not there, yet continuing to ruin his life regardless. The lengthy sex scenes set to borderline-parodic slow tunes are uncomfortable to sit through and indicative of the palpable male gaze behind every aspect of the production. Listening to the conversations Wiseau writes for his female stars is as enlightening as it is hilarious; in an attempt to portray some perceived, inherent unfaithfulness in women, he unwittingly reveals precisely why his relationships have likely failed in the past: he understands no one but himself (and a hyperbolically perfect version at that). Imagining what Wiseau thought he was making boggles the mind - some modern-day Greek tragedy, complete with irony and high drama, culminating in a Citizen-Kane-esque room-smashing scene; above all, a depiction of how Great Men like himself can be torn apart by all those conniving women. Therein, of course, lies the humour: the timing is so naturally comedic and the absurdity increases so surely that one cannot help but laugh at the disaster playing out on screen. It captures an odd kind of cognitive dissonance, the sense that one is watching something very closely resembling a film while so clearly not being one. That said, movies get worse than this - not much, but they do - the main theme in the score is decidedly pleasant and the camerawork, all things considered, is not the worst. (Apparently this was shot on 35mm and HD video. Simultaneously. Might as well have started a money bonfire while you're at it.) I suppose this is partially responsible for its cult status, as it's a lot more accessible than cinematic diarrhoea on the scale of, say, After Last Season. Why is it even called The Room? Perhaps a misspelling of The Roof, as they seem to spend a lot more time there than in any specific room. That's it, I'm done: rating 1/10 and moving on.",

A good majority of the dialogue does not corrolate to the plot, like how Claudette probably has breast cancer, or Lisa's comment on how 'the computer business is really competitive' regarding Johnny not getting a promotion.I don't know where he found some of these actors, but the fact that they're so bad and that the only decent actor was the drug dealer who threatens Denny midway through the film (Who most likely was quickly grabbed of the street at random) leaves me on the edge of my seat wanting to know more about what Tommy Wiseau will feed me next.",

            "content": "\"The Room\" (2003), oh boy..... Where in the world do I begin? This \"movie\" has found a spot on my list of the top 10 worst films I have ever seen. Boring and confused storyline, dreadful acting, cheap special effects, dull sets/locations, and a predictable generic soundtrack. The story is actually based off a novel written by Tommy Wiseau, who is responsible for the existence of this \"movie\". He couldn't get the book published. Huh, I wonder why? So, he resorted to getting his novel made into this train wreck, oop, I mean, \"movie\". If the \"film\" is any indication to how the novel is laid out, then we can see why no one would help him get his book published. The story is basically a love triangle between main character Johnny, his fiancee Lisa, and friend Mark. Now at first glance, that just sounds like your typical every day love triangle plot. But I assure you, it's a lot more than that. A lot more than that! This \"movie\" is littered with subplots that don't add up, additional characters that contribute nothing to the story, so on and so forth. I guess Tommy Wiseau is a big Zack Snyder fan; who is the true king of unresolved subplots! If it wasn't for the unnecessary plot holes, then the story would have somewhat of an impact. Even though it's your typical love triangle story told over 1,000 times before. Another thing, just look at the \"movie\" poster, it looks like a poster made for a horror movie. Since when was \"The Room\" ever remotely classified to be a horror film?! As far as the acting goes, it's just as abysmal as the storyline. Tommy Wiseau is, by far, the worst actor in this \"movie\". The rest of the actors are just as bad as well, maybe Tommy Wiseau's presence just rubbed off on them? In this \"movie\", he plays the main character, named Johnny. But that's not all he does for this \"film\". He also wrote, produced, executive produced, and yes, directed this \"film\". Every other actor ranges from just plain bad, to lackluster. However, there are two actors who do look like they're actually trying. Greg Sestero as Mark doesn't do that bad, but he's still substandard. There is one actor who puts on a great performance, Dan Janjigian as Chris-R. He is, without question, the best actor in this \"film\". Ironically, he wasn't even a professional actor at that time! He never had any training to be an actor, just wrap your head around that. The person with no acting experience puts on a better performance than everyone else. Something doesn't seem right there! The special effects are just as cheap and generic as you would expect. Honestly, I've seen better effects in movies made back in the 1950's! The sets/locations are dull and boring, and you can tell that the majority of the scenes were filmed in a studio! But, the exterior scenes aren't too bad, as it's filmed in San Francisco. All of the exterior shots of the city are the true saving graces for this \"movie\", but even those can actually get repetitive. They somehow made California boring! How is that possible?! Finally, we have a boring and cliched soundtrack to tie this diarrhea stain together. Not only is the soundtrack lazily edited, but it's just boring. The only part of the score I remember is the opening credits theme. I'm sensing a pattern here, that some of the worst movies have the best opening sequences, in order to try and fool the audience that it's going to be a good movie. Yes, I do understand that all movies need a strong opening to give a good first impression. But they seem to always forget, the rest of the movie has to be good as well! \"The Room\" is truly, the epitome of how not to make a movie. It should be required viewing for film students in college, so they can learn the basics on how not to make a movie, to avoid ruining the future of cinema! There is nothing positive I can salvage from this waste of film making. I'm giving this \"film\" 0 out of 5 stars on my scale. If I could rate it 0 stars I would, but 1 is as low as I can go. Ignore the 1 star rating on IMDB, my true rating is 0 stars. To end my review, I'm going to just say this. I know you'll think I'm crazy, but \"The Room\" is seriously worth checking out, it is one of those bad movies that you have to see to believe. You will not believe your eyes, it's so bad, that it's surprisingly kind of good! It has gained a cult following, and it is popular for all the wrong reasons. If you're going to watch \"The Room\", I suggest watching it with someone else. Then, it'll be much more fun to laugh at! To Tommy Wiseau, the disaster artist, let me just ask you this: what in the world were you thinking? \"You are tearing us apart!\"",

I've known about this film for a long time, and I decided to watch it for the first time after watching Franco's The Disaster Artist, which was about the movie's troubled production, and boy, I tell you, it truly deserves the title of \"The Best Worst Film Ever Made.\" The film was littered with subplots that were never talked about again after the scenes introducing them, like Denny's drug and money problems, Lisa's mom having breast cancer, which she NEVER brings up again! There's even some confusing garbage in there too, like their adoptive son Denny, yes, you heard me right, he's adopted according to a later scene, wanting to watch Johnny and Lisa have sex when he has homework to do! What the fudge, Wiseau? That's not all, thanks to Google, I found out that Wiseau wrote a few songs for his movie and got some singers to sing them. That's right. Wiseau wrote four fudging songs for this personification of all that is bad execution, and released them for its soundtrack! Wiseau himself, was really terrible as Johnny. He sounds so bored all the time. Compare Wiseau's role as Johnny to Jon Stewart's role as Zeebad in Harvey Weinstein's unnecessary dub for The Magic Roundabout, or Doogal in the US, there is no comparison! (Okay, maybe a little). What's crazier is that the film is supposed to be about Johnny getting back at Lisa for cheating on him, but they threw all that out the window like Johnny did with the TV in the end just for unneeded nonsense that doesn't connect to the story! This is minor, but in one scene, I saw the Disney Store in the background of one of the scenes, and Disney didn't even think about suing Wiseau for not getting the rights to use their logo, though considering his unknown wealth, he probably bought the rights during the production. In Johnny's words, \"YOU HAD TORE ME APART, WISEAU!\" The end just doesn't make any sense! After Johnny dies, Lisa has the chance to live with Mark from now on, but then he blames Lisa for Johnny's death and leaves her! I've heard of half-baked redemptions, but a half-baked betrayal is a whole new level! No wonder Adult Swim aired this film for a few April Fools. In conclusion, this is one heck of a disasterpiece, and if you thought Foodfight! Was the worst movie ever made, that movie's actually the worst ANIMATED movie ever made. This, this is the worst LIVE-ACTION movie ever made, and everyone fudging loves it that way!

Now thinking that she loves Johnny's best friend Mark (Greg Sestero), she sets out to seduce him. And, despite the advice of others in their circle, she's in absolutely no rush to tell Johnny the truth.This movie certainly became a legend in its own time, even if for all the wrong reasons. Its absolutely ridiculous (but oh so quotable) script quickly entered the public lexicon: \"Oh hi Mark.\", \"You are TEARING ME APART, Lisa!\", \"Ha ha ha, what a story, Mark.\", etc. The fact that this script is so cheesy is compounded by a lot of cheesy acting, as well, with Lisa's mother (Carolyn Minnott) a hoot as she tries to harangue Lisa into staying with Johnny for financial stability purposes. That said, the movie is never more amusing than when the inimitable Wiseau is on screen.One can believe that Wiseau started this effort with serious intentions, trying to examine the importance of trust and transparency in relationships & friendships, but the silliness of the plot & dialogue just sink the whole thing. Not that that's necessarily a bad thing; people quickly came to embrace \"The Room\" as a modern classic in terms of \"so bad they're good\" movies.A poorly-made clunker with a hilariously melodramatic music score and a couple of really bad songs, \"The Room\" is ideal viewing if one is in the mood for a lot of laughs and has a lot of beers at the ready.

Out of embarrassment, Tommy Wiseau claimed it was a Black Comedy. It was marketed as a Black Comedy. That's kind of like making \"Inception\", and then releasing it as a chick flick. Acting was very paralyzed, Every time there was more than two people in the room, one of them would say \"I have to get going\". Everyone is always coming in and out of Johnny's apartment, Lisa's mother makes a comment about how \"it's like Grand Central Station\". People are constantly looking directly at the camera, Kyle Vogt, one of Johnny's friends, does this excessively. Almost all of Johnny's diologue is ad libbed in to the final print, he constantly looks like a fish.All in all, The Room is a terrible movie.

            "content": "I've watched more than a few films that have been popularly described as \"the worst ever,\" and too many more that were genuinely worse. One almost feels a sense of obligation to the medium to check out movies like 'The room,' whose legends far precede them; only by watching pure sludge can one come to truly appreciate good movies for what they are. That doesn't make the experience any less arduous, though - there are, in fact, worse movies in existence, yet the hype surrounding this abysmal affair is pretty much exactly on point.Now, credit where it's due: generally speaking I think the cinematography credited to Todd Barron is actually pretty solid, and rich. (I did say \"generally\" - there are absolutely instances where the entire image appears horribly artificial.) I appreciate the fine work of the hair and makeup artists, and the wardrobe actually quite fetching.That, however, is where my praise ends. In every way that's most meaningful, 'The room' is excruciating. There isn't one trace of authenticity to be found anywhere in this title. Acting has rarely ever been more bland and unconvincing - delivery, expression, and even fundamental comportment and movement within a moment are egregious beyond description. Dialogue and scene writing are atrocious, bare-faced, unsubtle monstrosities, shredding any glimmer of engagement or suspension of disbelief. There are multiple instances of scenes that serve no purpose at all. We suffer through several sex scenes, all of which are grotesquely flimsy and lacking of sensuality - the only possible points of comparison are the sex scenes in Uwe Boll's 'BloodRayne,' or 1995 \"erotic thriller\" 'Fatal passion.'Whether it's the insertion of popular songs into the soundtrack, the timing of the delivery of lines with action on screen, or the entrance or exit of characters from scenes, a terrible preponderance of 'The room' is executed with forced, stilted, deliberate, contrived pacing that would make it impossible to become invested even if the content were worthwhile. There is minor potential in the character writing and narrative for a meaningful low-key drama, but this feature is made with so little care or mindfulness that all such potential is stripped away. One could say this is awfully low-budget and suffers for it, yet better movies have done more with less. One could say that the cast are incredulously unskilled actors - and, well, that may be true - but even a cursory reading of the history informs that the production was deeply troubled at every stage. The end result of what we see on-screen owes at least as much if not more to Tommy Wiseau's incompetence, frequent changes among the cast and crew, and wild inconsistency in fundamental oversight of the film as it does to incapable players.I will readily admit that the movie did make me laugh a few times. And I can tell you exactly when: in the most exaggerated instances of Wiseau's overacting (including of course the infamous line, \"You are tearing me apart, Lisa!\"), and in the mimicry of chickens clucking. It's more absurd than I can easily put into words. With this in mind, the best chance 'The room' had at claiming value is in the notion that it was, after all, intended as a comedy, a parody, a deadpan and consciously overwrought rendition of all these story beats. Unfortunately, this notion is patently untrue, as extensive history of the production informs.I see what this could have been. I see the play Wiseau supposedly adapted into his screenplay. I see notable themes and archetypes that could have been explored to actually impactful ends. None of this matters when the finished product, the title we're watching, is made as wretchedly as this is. 'The room' has a reputation larger than the movie itself, and though it's probably not the single worst film ever made, at this level any distinction is meaningless. Except for those whose curiosity exceeds their wisdom (I include myself), there's just no reason to watch 'The room.' Even if it makes you laugh it's not especially worth it, and the best thing that the picture has going for it is simply its notoriety. Take that as you will.",

It's poorly made overall, but there are some shots and choices that are actually very smart and done well, even if I suspect they are accidental. That being said, I've seen this movie more than some movies I'd give a nine or ten to and not once regretted it.I love this movie. Despite the two star rating, it is one of my all time favorite movies to watch. Every time I see it, there's something new that pops out at me that I didn't notice before. Of course, it started out as an ironic love, but it's developed from that into an unironic adoration and appreciation of this movie that I don't have for many other movies of this kind.Tommy Wiseau has since come out and said he made the movie as a comedy.

Every moment of the film cuts to a stupid shot of the golden gate bridge. No real story. Was happy when it finally ended. So bad that it was bad. Probably the worst movie ever made. The story behind its creation is really interesting though, which is why I recommend Disaster Artist. That movie makes you feel bad that this movie never made anything.",

            "content": "(Despite a seemingly 'positive' review, I rated the movie a 4, and for three reasons:quoting \"Tootsie\": 'God forbid it lost its status as a cult failureit's a little nod to Roger Ebert who gave four stars to what he believed were the great movies, the film is indeed bad in a great waywell, the film is bad, isn't it?)I heard and read so many good things about all the bad things in Tommy Wiseau's \"The Room. But if it didn't really encourage me to watch it, I still checked on the 'classic' moments from Youtube and my curiosity was fully satisfied, I knew the main lines and catchphrases and I could see why the film had became such a revered (or reverse) classic, but I didn't care about watching it as much as I didn't care about \"Plan 9 From Outer Space\", morbid curiosity is something I lack for that matter.If it wasn't for James Franco's release of \"The Disaster Artist\", an adaptation of Greg Sestero's book chronicling the apparently disastrous making of the film and how an ambitious project turned out to be the \"'best worst movie ever\" made, nothing would have raised my curiosity. I suspect there are many viewers who're going to watch the film before checking on Franco's. It's like a rebirth for Tommy Wiseau and a definite entrance of \"The Room\" as one of these movies known for the wrong reasons, but known nonetheless. The ways of Hollywood are unpredictable and many stinkers have achieved more fame than 'classics'. \"The Room\" is one of them. Paraphrasing a slogan from Eddie Murphy's \"Boomerang\": it stinks so good!To call the film 'bad' is an understatement, you could sum up the story by saying it's about a man who loves a woman or a woman who loves a man, but they're not the same, it's also about a kid who owes money, a thug who wants it badly, a drug deal, a mother who has breast cancer, a girl who wrongfully accuses her fianc\u00e9, I mean, future husband of hitting her but he insists he did not... in fact the film is beyond the idea of 'being about something', most of these subplots have no set-ups and no resolutions whatsoever, they just happen without even having a reason to happen, it's like mixing up the idea of cooking with throwing ingredients on a saucepan and waiting for something to \"happen\".There's indeed a sense of anarchic disdain to any screen writing requirement, a succession of bits as random as possible that whether it's intentional or accidental is besides the point, it's bad in a genuinely genius way. And don't get me started on the acting. The film made me believed there are three schools of acting: good acting, bad acting and \"Room\" acting, Tommy Wiseau is a school by himself, he recites his lines as if he had just learn them phonetically, he doesn't look straight in the eyes, his mood changes suddenly, his lines are punctuated by the weirdest laugh ever and start with \"Oh, Hi!\" so many times it'll certainly inspire some drinking games.ButWiseau finds his match in all the actors who act is they've been picked like Homer Simpson when he became the monorail driver. The actors have no experience and just give enough conviction to convey the right ersatz of emotion, but the effect is all the same, it's laughable. You don't laugh because they act bad, but because you know what you're supposed to feel and you're baffled because they don't even try, and I guess that's the film's secret. Indeed, there's a sparkle lighting that movie and making it immune to sheer disdains, it's like we laugh with it but not at it, as it seems unbelievable that none would be aware of how bad it is.\"The Room\" rises below the idea of great movie, it's bad but make you care about how bad it is, and not every great film becomes a classic, not every great film inspires a movie about its making, much more, there are so many movies trying to be 'great' and falling flat, it takes some guts to make a film that doesn't even try to be great and succeed gloriously.",

I had been holding out on watching The Room for a long time, but upon the release of The Disaster Artist, I felt it was the right time to divulge into the madness. And make no mistake, the film does not disappoint. This is easily one of the worst films ever made, if not the worst. But unlike many horrible films I have seen, there's a certain amount of undeniable enjoyment here. I know Tommy Wiseau has come out and said the film was purposefully comedic and should be considered a \"dark comedy\", but there's no way most of this film was this intentionally bad. Either way, there are so many memorably awful and funny things to come out of this. First off, unless it was just my copy of the DVD from the library, but it sure seemed like the words spoken and the timing of the characters mouth's moving were not linked up for most of the film. But that's the only major technical issue I noticed with the movie. Speaking of which, how in god's name did this film cost 6 million dollars to make? There's no action, shouldn't be any special effects, nor green screen scenes (though apparently Wiseau did actually do some of that). Why would this film cost that much? An even better question may be how the heck he came up with 6 million on his own to produce this? At any rate, The Room is one of the most fun mistakes Hollywood has ever produced. I'm already looking at YouTube constantly for these short clips from the film that make absolutely no sense to fulfill my entertainment for that particular moment. It's no wonder why James Franco was able to come up with an entire film worth of ideas and moments to make The Disaster Artist a success.0.5/10(.5 for the mere fact that this film is memorably atrocious)",

I mean, I guess there is in fact a room featured, but it's no more featured than any other movie. Anyway, like most bad movies, it suffers from being dreadfully boring. Everything about this movie is so awkward it makes me hate it. I think the most annoying thing is how Johnny keeps making this \"cheep cheep cheep\" noise over and over, imitating a chicken. Wait, isn't that a chick? There are literally three sex scenes in the first half hour of this movie. We do finally get the fourth one near the end. Any film with four sex scenes that isn't a porno deserves to be considered one of the worst films of all time. They're so monotonous and pointless. There's this one scene where a guy tries to kill this one guy which goes nowhere. The characters all get tuxedos so they can...play football? What? It is so dreadfully boring. We see Johnny fight this guy. It stops, but then he does it minutes later. Why is this happening? None of this means anything.This film is dreadfully monotonous to the point where I really just wanted it to end soon but at least I was fortunate enough to download the Rifftrax version for it. It was so hilarious especially with how Disembodio wanted to talk through all the sex scenes. This was a movie that I had to have the Rifftrax audio with, because I knew it would be too horrible for me to do without it. This also ended up being featured in what many people consider to be the Nostalgia Critic's best review. Tommy Wiseau himself didn't like people mocking his movie. He shouldn't have made it so bad.With Rifftrax, I really liked, \"I hate you guy who looks like me!\". Another great one was, \"First, death to all patio furniture!\". There was also, \"I'm not feeling good today\", \"Why?\" with the riff, \"I saw my fianc\u00e9e naked\". I also loved, \"Another underwear conversation related tragedy!\". Call me immature, but I thought, \"He's being a big baby\" was great with the joke, \"Should see him in his diaper, ow!\". The money is well worth it. 1/2*",

Everything changes from that point the relationships between them won't be the same again.I have to admit that I watched this movie knowing what is all about so, I was prepared for it. After watching I understood why this movie is considered the best worst movie of all times. The plot is very simple because there is not a plot or connection between the scenes and you have to figure out many things by yourself in order to cover all the plot holes. About the interpretations now, Tommy Wiseau who played as Johnny the successful banker was the worst by far but extremely funny on his role or maybe in his real life too, Greg Sestero who played as Mark the best friend of Johny was equally bad with him and of course Juliette Danielle who played as Lisa, Johny's fianc\u00e9e was a bit better than them. It has to be mentioned that the direction which was made by Tommy Wiseau who was also the producer of it was simply hilarious because you could not understand what was going on in this movie or why is this so bad.Finally, I have to say that \"The Room\" is a bad movie but if you have a bad day at work etc just watch it and I am sure you are going to laugh a lot and you feel a lot better when it finishes.

After Reading some reviews and bloc entries about the \"cult\" status of this \"the room\" and the iconic shout: \"Your are tearing me apart, Lisa!\" plus the intriguing factor of Tommy Wisseau I decided to give a chance to the film because I thought that, at least, the laughs would be granted. Wrong.Not a single laugh in 90 minutes. Not a single emotion more than a progressive change of mood from apathy to depression.Does it sound overreacted? I'll try to explain the reasons: 1-The acting of the entire cast is immeasurably bad. I don't know how much I going to live (I hope that at least enough to see another 1000 movies) but I'm sure that I'm not going to witness another acting such as crappy as this. 2-Tommy Wiseau. The first I saw his face was in a IMDb's user list and I must recognize that it captivated me. An enigmatic face, worthy of being typical evil troubled villain of a b-series bad movie. But I lost the interest for him in the very first scenes of \"the room\". The worst thing about his acting is he believes he is a first class performer whilst actually he is... he isn't even funny. It's a shame I can't use a better English in order to describe him 3-Was this nightmare's Budget 6 million bucks? In this moment is when I start to cry and when I feel that I would give a huge hug to Wiseau If I were to meet him someday because he's nothing more than a victim. A victim because the entire crew of the film laughed in his face. With 6000 dollars every user of IMDb with a Handy cam, a microphone, 6 Friends and a PC would have made a better experiment than this.In conclusion, don't waste your time watching this.

His backstory is sketchy and no one really knows anything about him. I wonder if he meant to make a film so horrible or was it an accident. It's been said that he called it a drama until the internet collectively dismissed it a serious movie.\nWiseau cast himself as Johnny, a banker from San Francisco, who is in love with girlfriend Lisa (Juliette Danielle). Lisa is bored of the relationship and has an affair with Johnny's friend Mark (Greg Sestero). Johnny for the longest is oblivious as to what is going on around him and he desperately wants to keep Lisa in his life and marry her. There is also a young man named Denny who follows Johnny and Lisa around and has a drug habit that the others aren't aware of until almost the end of the film.\nThe story sounds like a basic romantic drama, sure, but it is filled with painfully odd and unintentionally funny scenes.

This film is the very definition of absurd and many people love it for that reason, but honestly when I sat down to watch the whole film I was kind of bored.

The Room features acting that is noticeably bad as the actors rarely show proper emotion as you can tell as if they don't know what it is they are doing. As well as the dialogue (consisting of \"Oh hi\" and \"my future wife\", along with others)Watching this film as one would know it's not good makes the viewing better. There is a lot of unintentional comedy in this film coming from the characters, the situation and overall chemistry and random unneeded sex scenes. The Room is quite funny in that aspect and is funnier than many recent comedies of the last few years. Although not labeled a comedy and more so a drama, though some claim it as a dark comedy- which makes sense.===\nAs a rewatch 01/20/18' the Room remains a highly entertaining and unintentionally funny film. Having revisited this film from after watching the Disaster Artist, there is much in which that film did in which we see here in the room. As have already pointed out, this film was meant to be serious but within the characters' acting and overall lines, awkward sex scenes and other bizarre happenings, this film is more content with being a dark comedy. Better on a second viewing with more content of paying attention.

There's a real art to creating something so jaw-droppingly bad, so head-scratchingly awful that you start to question your very existence. Tommy Wiseau's The Room, commonly referred to as the Citizen Kane of bad movies, has this art perfected. When the film trickled into selected theatres back in 2003, nobody could have predicted the impact it would have. Nobody, that is, apart from narcissistic writer, director, producer and star Tommy Wiseau.Only Wiseau undoubtedly had visions of being showered with admiration and awards, even timing the film's release to qualify for the Academy Awards. Instead, The Room quickly developed a reputation as a side-show, screened regularly as part of the midnight movie circuit where audience members would shout the movie's memorable catch-phrases and hurl plastic cutlery at the screen. Wiseau has since explained that The Room was always meant to be a black comedy and never intended for it to be taken seriously, but that's about as believable as the director's claims that he was born in America. In fact, nothing about The Room is believable, from the wobbly-looking sets and wooden actors to the stilted dialogue and painfully long sex scenes. When you discover that this actually cost $6 million to make - somehow funded by Wiseau himself - you'll be wondering how the hell it ended up looking like an Australian soap opera.Wiseau plays Johnny, a wealthy banker who seemingly possesses no character flaws. He has the appearance of a weather-beaten vampire with a head full of tar-dunked hair and a voice that resembles Christopher Walken if the King of New York actor was born in Eastern Europe and had suffered a stroke. His \"future wife\" Lisa (Juliette Danielle) has grown bored with Johnny and infatuated with his handsome best friend Mark (Greg Sestero). Despite pleas from her mother Claudette (Carolyn Minnott) to stay with the man who will take care of her financially, Lisa seduces Mark. After a night of drinking, Lisa falsely accuses Johnny of hitting her (\"I did not hit her! I did naaaht!\"). But being the optimistic, all-round great guy that he is, Johnny doesn't let this get in the way of emotionally supporting his young neighbour Denny (Philip Haldiman), the man-boy orphan who Johnny treats like a son, or to throw on a tuxedo for a game of catch with his buddies.The Room resembles a 100-minute sitcom episode during which one or two sets are visited by a roster of minor characters that in no way resembles real life. Sub-plots, such as Denny landing himself in trouble with a gun-wielding drug dealer or Claudette's revelation that she has cancer, are introduced only to be never discussed again. Rather than exploring the characters by actually giving them something to do other than walk into a room and offer mundane advice, Wiseau would rather give us no fewer than four extended sex scenes, three of which involving the filmmaker's bare arse thrusting against Danielle's stomach. Scenes play out on rooftops and alleyways that are clearly sets with a green-screen backdrop, raising the question of why Wiseau didn't simply shoot on location. But thanks to endless establishing shots of San Francisco landmarks, we know that they're definitely not in a Los Angeles studio. It would be easy to talk about The Room for hours and not even scratch the surface of just how strange yet utterly fascinating it is. See it, hate it, and then love it. And tell your friends to do the same.",

You probably already know what he looks and sounds like, and you likely have seen photographs of that extraordinary bill-board in Los Angeles - the one Wiseau paid around $5000 a month to display, and kept it up for five years. But when he first appears in the movie, it's still cause for shock. Wiseau doesn't fit his own movie - but then what movie could he fit? With the long, stringy black hair, baggy suits, weird accent, pallor and weather-beaten features, Wiseau looks like a member of a down-on- their-luck jazz ensemble playing a tugboat in New Orleans. He does not look like he belongs anywhere near the other actors in this movie.And how Wiseau was able to finance it is a question without an answer.If the movie has a theme, it's misogyny. You've heard of the Bechdel test? This movie would fail the reverse of that: the male characters talk constantly about women, how they're \"too smart, too stupid, or just evil\", as the Wiseau character \"Johnny\" says. His fianc\u00e9e, Lisa, is an apparent psychopath. Her reasons for cheating on Johnny are non-existent; when she says she loves Mark, it's impossible to believe her. And when she fabricates details about Tommy hitting her (yes, his reaction is hilarious) and forces the teetotaler to get drunk, one feels no inclination to examine the character for reasons why. There is no character. It's like someone took the archetype of an attractive woman from every MGTOW activist and tossed it onto the screen.And, when the movie arrives at its predictable conclusion, she cries. Why would such a cold, hard, calculating b-i-t-c-h cry when she has achieved exactly what her earlier scenes convince you she wanted? Ah - there I go again. I'm asking questions of this movie, and anyone who's seen it knows that's a fool's errand. No one in it behaves in any way like actual people would behave, nothing works the way it works in reality, no one says anything you can imagine a person actually saying. The actors are either phoned in, overly grateful, or Tommy Wiseau, who is in a category of his own as one of the worst actors ever committed to celluloid.My one regret is that the movie isn't the so-bad-it's-good, \"Citizen Kane\"-of-bad-movies laugh-riot you are hoping for. It's like a very cheap Cinemax morality tale visited by a Martian named Tommy.",

            "content": "One of the most infamous bad movies there are. They're still showing this in select theaters, a bit like Rocky Horror Picture Show. Not because it's in any way a good movie - it's all things conceivable, but not that - but because it's such a good movie to sit through with your friends and riff on it.The wannabe magnum opus of its director/writer/producer/executive producer/lead actor, Tommy Wiseau, The Room is the story of Johnny (Wiseau), his fiancee, Lisa (Juliette Danielle), and his best friend, Mark (Greg Sestero). It's a story about how Lisa suddenly becomes bored of Johnny and cheats on him with Mark. And all the bizarre and bad things that happen because of it.And when you put it like that, it actually sounds a bit boring. So just what makes this movie so fascinating, and admittedly fun, to watch? The execution. And the fact that Wiseau actually had a budget for this, but had no idea what to do with it. The sets are decent, they use professional cameras and lighting, there's even some green screen utilized. Put this is all used to film one of the most egregious student films there is. The dialogues are laughably wooden, the acting even more so, there's way too many badly filmed sex scenes, there's like a bazillion continuity errors and plot points, it's pretty clear they accidentally cut out some key scenes, and the ending is so over the top melodramatic that it's glorious.A student film, in a nutshell. But one filmed by a man at least in his late thirties. (We actually don't know when Mr. Wiseau was born, or where. There has been speculation. The word extraterrestrial might have been mentioned.)Watching this film is a prolonged exercise in asking the question \"Why!?\" and learning to cope with the fact that there are no answers. And that can be a lot of fun, in a baffling way.Definitely worth watching. Yes, it's bad, but it'd be hard to watch this film without knowing that. And when you go in with the right expectations, you'll most probably enjoy yourself.",

            "content": "All I can really say about The Room, the debut feature of visionary filmmaker, actor, producer, and hair extension enthusiast Tommy Wiseau, is that nothing like it has ever before been made, and probably will never be made again. Raw and fearless in its exploration of human desire and despair, this film unabashedly glares into the souls of its audience and asks that most timeless of questions, \"Do you understand life?\" After seeing this film, you will.Wiseau stars in the film as Johnny, who may at first glance resemble a slab of undrained deviled ham, but who quickly wins our hearts with his easy manner, quick wit, and tendency to greet everyone he meets with an enthusiastic \"Oh hai,(character's name)!\" Johnny begins the film with a seemingly perfect life- he is a successful San Francisco banker, has a best friend named Mark who, for unexplained reasons appears to be 20 years his junior, and is a favored customer at the neighborhood flower shop. His days are filled with whimsical activities such as tuxedo-clad football in Golden Gate Park and making \"cheep cheep cheep\" noises with his pals. To top it all off, he has a stunningly beautiful live-in girlfriend named Lisa, who may be a little bit chubby and a little bit whorish, but whose beauty and sexiness shine through by the sheer force of Johnny constantly reminding us how beautiful and sexy she is.Unfortunately, Johnny's life is not all tuxedo football and lingering shots of San Francisco landmarks. The film wastes no time getting into its deeper themes, namely that women are all horrible soulless bitches whose idea of a good time is to suck their man dry of all happiness and will to live. In spite of Johnny providing Lisa with the financial stability that her femaleness prevents her from securing for herself, Lisa is quick to turn on him when he fails to get the promotion he so clearly deserved. As a result of her increasing boredom, Lisa seduces Mark, then continues to toy with Johnny's emotions by feigning pregnancy and accusing him of abuse. Johnny's unraveling at the hands of his evil harpy reaches its tragic climax when, broken down and defeated, he reaches to the heavens and cries out the immortal line, \"You're tearing me apart, Lisa!\" In a stunning sequence of ironic visual metaphor, Johnny proceeds to tear apart the titular room and put a gun barrel in his mouth, thus reaching the tragic conclusion of his descent into mania. At this point the audience's collective heart is ripped in two as we are forced to gaze upon this senseless loss, and the only salvation we receive is the sight of Mark and Lisa staring down at Johnny's lifeless body, only now understanding what their actions have done to this poor, beautiful soul.Though the film's conclusion will undoubtedly leave any mentally functional viewer weeping uncontrollably, it is in service of a vital message. Namely, that even though being a wonderful person will not stop those you love from screwing you over without hesitation, them sons of bitches will sure be sorry when you off yourself. Poignant moments of truth such as this are abundant throughout The Room, and are illustrated by the films cast of memorable side characters. For example, in one of the film's most romantic scenes, Lisa's friend Michelle and her boyfriend, Michelle's Boyfriend utter the unforgettable truism that \"chocolate is the flavor of love\". It truly is.",

            "content": "I've finally discovered this movie because of the release of The Disaster Artist which is about the making of this film and the fact that one of my local cinemas has screened this film for one hundred months in a row.There are movies that are so bad that they are genuinely entertaining like the vivid and weird Samurai Cop. Other films are so bad that they are genuinely horrible and don't have anything going for them like the vapid Hobgoblins. The Room is actually a mixture of both types of bad movies. The first thirty minutes of the film were extremely hard to sit through and basically just consisted of poorly shot soft porn scenes. However, the final hour or so was so absurd with numerous strange subplots and a certain raise in tension that it kept my attention until the end.There are a few elements that I genuinely like. First of all, the camera work isn't too bad if compared to numerous contemporary low budget flicks with shaky camera perspectives. Secondly, Juliette Danielle isn't only nice to look at but has a certain appeal as confused sociopath and careless femme fatale. Thirdly, Tommy Wiseau's acting skills, even though they are wooden, definitely have a memorable and unique touch and aren't like anything I have ever seen in my life. Fourthly, the movie's soundtrack blends in very well. I wouldn't call it great but it serves its purpose in the different scenes.The other elements are so bad that they keep my attention. The acting skills vary from below average to bad. The dialogues are so thin, repetitive and wooden that an average elementary school student could have come up with something more intriguing. The main story could be described in three sentences but takes more than one hour and a half hours to unfold in a painfully slow development. The numerous unnecessary subplots going nowhere are cringe-worthy oddities that turn out being unintentionally memorable. The decorations and settings look cheap, fake and misplaced. The overlong sex scenes look so unreal that they are actually everything but exciting.Among the biggest oddities are the random spoon pictures, the main character's friends making love in his living room for no apparent reason, the emotionless dialogue about breast cancer, the numerous random football scenes and the two fake scenes involving characters tripping and getting injured. My favorite part is however the scene in the flower shop with the overtly quick exchange of senseless dialogue lines. This scene alone shows everything this film is about: a random scene with an unimportant side character, weak acting skills, bland dialogues, ordinary settings and unintentionally funny improvisation.The Room might have several purposes. It shows us how not to make a movie. It's a great party flick to watch with your friends to switch your brains off. It's a welcome distraction from your everyday lives. It's bizarre, goofy and almost surreal in its very unique style. It's a movie you won't ever forget. These are perhaps unintentional accomplishments that most serious films however fail to achieve which is why Tommy Wiseau still deserves some serious respect for his project.Despite its numerous obvious flaws, it's a weird experience you won't forget anytime soon which is exactly why this disaster of a movie became a cult classic. The sad thing is that Tommy Wiseau put so much passion into this project that I would honestly recommend watching this movie over any exchangeable contemporary superhero sequel flooding the world's cinemas. The Room is one of those movies you should have watched once in your lifetime for all the reasons stated above. I'm sure I will watch it again with a bunch of friends after having just discovered this film on my own this week.",

Yes the acting is horrific and the storyline is quite clich\u00e9. On the other hand you have to give Tommy Wiseau SOME credit for trying to make a dollar. If there's anything I've learned from this movie it would be these:1) Have an affair with your future husband in public 2) Throw around a football with tuxes on 3) Take shockingly bad news rather decently 4) Make cat noises when fighting with your best friend, AND! 5) Always ask if someone is dead when they obviously are.Overall there's not much else to say, like the NC said it's really worth checking out granted we don't get yelled at by those copyright nazi's over at Wiseau Films.

            "content": "The Room... directed by Tommy Wiseau... I don't need to say anything else about this movie. It basically speaks for itself. It's the most notorious indie-drama of the 2000s and it's production resulted in co-star Greg Sestero to write the novel 'The Disaster Artist', chronicling the making of 'The Citizen Kane of Bad Movies'. And now The Disaster Artist is getting its own movie; directed by James Franco, who will also play Tommy Wiseau in the film; additionally, Dave Franco will play Greg Sestero. And The Room actually deserves a movie based around its legacy, because this film has a cult following like no other and a warped-beyond-comprehension fandom that embraces the film's unintentional campiness. Basically, it's an ironic masterpiece that's so bad it's amazing!The movie has dialogue that makes even the worst screen writing seem like the works of Robert Towne and Orson Welles; it's especially funny here because Wiseau actually cites Welles as a massive inspiration on his work. And... Tommy Wiseau has set such an admirably unique low-bar for indie-cinema that its effects on the indie film industry inspired lesser filmmakers to pick up their wits when making their passion projects. If Reservoir Dogs set the bar for quality and smart indie-cinema, then The Room set it for belief- suspending campiness full of WTF moments and nonsensical subplots that would inspire the likes of Birdemic, A Talking Cat and Cool Cat Saves The Kids. And The Room started this absurdity.The Room; it's like an alien trying to figure out how character drama works without realising anything about natural human behaviour or character. And that alien would be a very 'special' one.",

            "content": "The Room is a film directed, written, produced, starring and likely catered by fame-seeker and wannabe cultural icon Tommy Wiseau. Johnny (Wiseau) our Dramamine swilling protagonist is a seemingly perfect human being who lives in San Francisco with his fianc\u00e9e Lisa (Danielle). He exercises regularly running and playing catch with neighborhood urchin Denny (Haldiman). He also goes to his job to do business stuff. One day, Lisa wakes up realizing she no longer loves Johnny and seduces his best friend Mark (Sestero). All of the couple's mutual friends think Lisa's actions are despicable while Lisa's mother (Minnott) believes Johnny is the key to Lisa's financial security and she shouldn't call off the wedding. That is about as much plot as you can gleam out of this impossibly contrived film which aims for the melodrama of Dallas (1978-1991) but ends up feeling like a two act play written by second graders.The Room is considered one of the worst movies ever made which, after a very brief first life in theaters, has become a midnight screening staple and so- bad-it's-good classic to eye-rolling hipsters and giddy schlock fans. Boasting inept direction, screen writing, cinematography, lighting, acting, special-effects, editing, et al., The Room is essentially a master course of what NOT to do when it comes to film-making. Yet despite the film's almost willful ignorance to straightforward storytelling, the film has an appeal that defies logic. Like watching the hypnotic gaze of an esurient asp, The Room puts you in a trance and forces you to sit through the entire f***ing thing; from it's softcore porn bedroom scenes to it's woman hating living room scenes.I had the pleasure of sitting through this movie among the right crowd and found myself laughing often and hard. The film's artless bubbling; every moment of amateurishness was done in just about the worst way possible allowing the audience to become flabbergasted by it all. Wiseau has said that his biggest influences for The Room were films like Rebel Without a Cause (1955), and the collective works of Elizabeth Taylor, Tennessee Williams and Alfred Hitchcock. In reality the film is more an ugly-looking amalgam of everything an Eastern European immigrant would assume appeals to an American audience including extended moments of alley way football.One would need to watch this affront to celluloid countless times before they can truly discover how a movie like this could be so popular among certain crowds. Perhaps one place to start looking would be Wiseau's absolutely appalling performance as Johnny. Unlike the other \"actors\" that flood the screen, Wiseau doesn't just approach the script with amateurish drudgery. His idiosyncratic delivery, clumsy blocking and confusing chatter reaches new heights in gleeful, over-the-top nuttiness. It feels as if Wiseau was sent from another planet to make a movie as a test to see if they can assimilate. If in the years to come it's discovered there's been a They Live (1988) meets The X-Files (1993-present) season 9 type conspiracy, one would only need to see The Room to discover where it all started.The Room stands outside of time and space and certainly outside of the history of cinema. It's a movie that defies logic; a movie that proves quite entertaining if given the right circumstances but if slightly less overwrought would have been completely forgotten. Wiseau has appeared at many viewings of the film and bolsters his inflated ego as a purposeful disaster artist who revels in sardonic satire. I personally don't believe him for a minute. The frantic, neurotic emotional core of The Room is arguably the only thing about the film that felt genuine. That and two characters' uncomfortable obsession with chocolate. Seriously guys, get a room.",

Whatever.Simply put, this is a big, pile of steaming rubbish. Technically it is no better (and indeed, in many ways worse) than a cheap day time soap opera. There seems to be a lack of basic blocking, framing and focus. The acting is universally atrocious with the 'actors' blurting out lines with the same verve as first time porn performers. The script is incoherent with a multitude of incomplete story arcs, google translate dialogue and utterly insane narrative. You could forgive any of these issues if this were made and conceived by 7 year olds but the fact that this is made by actual, real grown ups makes one question our progression as a species.I read somewhere that this cost 6 million dollars to make. I would love to see the budget breakdown because just about any film student could make this with some amateur actors and an iphone and it would be better.

With a sharp blend of Arnold Schwarzennegger, Van Damn, and Dr. Frankenstein's monster   Tommy's performance is brilliant, hilarious, powerful, and even moving at some points. The screenplay & dialogue are even better pushing the limits of seventh grade drama. Armed with a blind cinematography and tri-pod supported by a one legged dwarf the film shows real life situations in a raw and entertaining manner. All the characters are loveable and enjoyable to watch, especially Denny a lifelike teenage puppet with the sensitive heart of gold. The character \"arch\" goes all over the place like a rocket rollercoaster too confused to stay on the track but entertaining none the less. I loved this movie, it may sound like I am being cynical but really I am not! This is tommy's first movie and by golly it is fun (just as long as you don't take it seriously). I think that this film will definitely find an audience and a large cult following.

This movie is unlike anything that has come before or will come after; it is a fact you should keep in mind when watching it.

The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike The Room ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Johnny's existential catchphrase \"I did not hit her! It's not true! It's bullshit, I did not hit her! I did not!... Oh, hai Mark!\" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Tommy Wiseau's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens.

            "content": "More often than not, when Hollywood falls into the misfortune of slapping audiences with a bottom-of-the-barrel cinematic atrocity, the final fate is it spirals into obscurity with virtually everyone forgetting about its existence within a matter of a year (maybe less). Then there is rare films such as 'The Room' that succeed at achieving the strange feat of soaking the audiences with laughter for how horrendous it is in quality. That is where Polish-born director Tommy Wiseau (or wherever on Earth he was born, who knows?) and his friend Greg Sestero come in. After a longtime struggle to sell their script to major studios, it was up to this duo to come up with their independent black comedy. The results are something initially unsurprising: a disastrous, slipshod, horribly acted slugfest that spent the following ten years growing an unusual cult status from audiences who relish in laughing at the final product for how wildly inept it is. In short, it is a rare cinematic pain- inducer that everyone is willing to withstand. So the story here follows Johnny (played by Tommy Wiseau), a San Francisco banker who is on his way to marrying his long-time girlfriend Lisa (played by Juliette Danielle). What the poor sap doesn't know however, is that Lisa has grown bored of him and decides she is not in love with him and has unexpectedly fell in love with his best friend Mark (played by Greg Sestero). Although Mark is initially reluctant, not wanting to soil his friendship with Johnny), Lisa is too persitent and pulls him into a romance that soon sends everyone's lives in a downward spiral.This film completes the handbook of how not to make a cinematic picture: horrendous acting, despicable excuse of a script, production values that would fit best for a middle school play, and dialogue that is just flat out bad to the core. If you wondering about the story, well, that's pretty much of an eye-roller as well. But Tommy Wiseau's mysterious distortion of artistic value evokes the mystery of how one can make such an atrocity and somehow provide a oddly fresh source of laughter. Wiseau, spending the entirety phoning in a mawkish performance and delivering his lines with total lack of authenticity, puts on the show with his goofy chemistry with Juliette Danielle. But once Lisa's plan to disavow her engagement with Johnny takes action, that is when the unintentional hilarity ensues. Each scene taking a place on the rooftop with the San Francisco, tacked in sloppy green-screen effects, has moments of \"so bad, it's good moments\" spectacle. Nearly every other scene, however, slips into the cracks of \"so inept, it's just bad\". That is not even including Wiseau's braindead way to filming and editing each scene, especially in the overlong sex scenes in which we witness repeated footage of Wiseau's nude back. Secondly, how often do you go to a friend's house and find pictures of silverware in the living room? Now that is just silly. Above all, the events that transpire are too short of substance in terms of execution the point where even the unintentional hilarity factor has difficult to dig up.The Room may indeed fit perfectly in the category one of the worst movies in cinematic history, but in its own special way. Regardless, the level of ridiculousness still falls too shallow to uphold a proper \"good because it's bad\" spectacle. It is more of just plain bad and not enough of funny bad, which is simply disappointing to say the least.",

Now, I have been hearing tales about this film for some years and it seems to be generally received by those who witness it as one of if not the worst made film of this millennium. That's got to be worth it hasn't it? Well, yes and no... The plot of 'The Room' is fairly simple - man loves woman, woman cheats on man, man kills himself... however the real problem is that it took the film about 50 minutes to actually make it clear that this was going to be the plot and the stunningly vague and indifferent way the story was presented amidst such side plots as the cheating whores mother having cancer or one of the minor recurring characters being attacked on a rooftop by a gun wielding drug dealer. The dealer was chased off and nothing was mentioned of it or his drug problems again, or in fact preceding this randomly inserted scene, and as to the whole cancer sub-plot, well, her mother mentioned it once and was told by her daughter not to worry and then it was dropped never to be seen again. I'm serious. It appears that Tommy Wiseau (who wrote, directed, produced and starred) doesn't have even the first idea of character development or in fact how to make a film, and by all accounts this cost $6million to make... So what else could be wrong then? How about four of the most painfully gratuitous and unrealistic intercourse scenes in the history of film within the first forty minutes? Presumably this was meant to titillate the audience or maybe to drum up some interest in the slowly moving and badly mumbled story but as a tactic it failed to do so spectacularly.Without wishing to sound too disrespectful if you look at the movies poster then you can see the face of Tommy Wiseau Negative and yet the first sex scene not only involves him as the leading male but also a great shot of his scrotum. Yup. I have seen that mans balls and it wasn't pretty. How on earth was that meant to sell the film? An interesting thing to note with it is that many of the actors (my apologies to any real actors out there) were not the initial ones cast as during the production many just, erm, left and so had to be replaced by understudies (or members of the crew) including the female lead... and boy does it show! There's a brilliant scene in the film where the four men are wearing tuxedos, one of them shocks the others by having shaved off his excuse for a beard and then they go outside and play catch. It may not sound brilliant, but when you take into account that there is no explanation for the fancy clothes, no explanation for the shaving and no plot based purpose for playing catch it suddenly becomes marvellous and a perfect example of how this movie was structured. Continually throughout there are pointless bits of dialogue and whole scenes that serve no purpose, they don't add to the plot or characterisation, they aren't even well shot! It pays to keep an eye out for some of the poorest points such as the camera going out of focus mid scene, badly synced dubbing (sometimes without anyones lips moving) and my favourite of cinematic tricks - not actually fitting everyone on screen at once when you were clearly trying to. There is no real sense of consistency or continuity here and that's probably why it's so bad... That and of course Tommy Wiseau who can hardly speak intelligible English. If you want to subject yourself to something as bad as bad can be then you might want to try this film, and I'd suggest a drinking game for it too - simply have a shot anyone (particularly Wiseau) says \"Oh, hi...\" or anytime someone says \"don't worry\", you'll be too drunk to care about the film within thirty minutes or less and will be drinking to most of the films dialogue too. Honestly, those are the two most repeated phrases in the film to the point where you'll end up cheering every time you hear someone utter them... it's a strange experience and quite frankly that's how I'd best describe it, as an experience. You won't be able to call it entertainment and you certainly can't call it art, but if you watch it then you do get the strange feeling that your brain is being horribly abused and might melt out of your head due to the inconsistencies and of course the repeated shots of Wiseau's face. In an ideal world this movie would be banned under the Genoeva Convention but as well know this world is far from perfect so you can just buy it on DVD, although I strongly urge you to steal it instead. Morally no-one will be able to fault you for not paying. Believe me when I say I could go on about all the ways this failed but would rather you just saw it for yourself, my words cannot do justice to it by a long way...",

The cinematography and lighting is pretty good but unfortunately my greatest criticism is Wiseau's input on the overall film i.e. directing, writing and even starring as the legendary Johnny. There are so many things about 'The Room' that simply doesn't make sense (lines of dialogue and even the plot). Mark's bizarre decisions in life, Lisa's motive to ruin people's lives and even choices of what to actually say like \"Did you get the promotion\" \"Nah\" \"You didn't get it did you?\".The summarise it up.

Tommy Wiseau did a terrific job in this movie, and was by far the greatest actor in this movie. Again, I'm not biased whatsoever. The Room is also a good family movie, with no inappropriate scenes. Goodbye, and thanks for all the fish.P.S. Also watch Superbabies 2 P.P.S Also watch Cool Cat saves the kidsYou won't be disappointed",

Okay, that I would buy.When Tommy Wiseau and Greg Sestero couldn't make it big in movies, they decided to make their own. What Wiseau set out to do was create a masterpiece. What he gave to the world is the worst movie to ever be shown on the silver screen. Yeah ... it was really THAT bad. There is no logical flow, terrible acting (if you can even call it that), contradictions in nearly every scene, unanswered questions, and god awful dialogue - this film was so embarrassingly horrible, that you can't help but laugh at its outrageousness. The more dramatic it tried to be, the harder I laughed.This movie is a paradox, a rarity in terms. You could never feel justified in recommending it to anyone, and yet you can't wait to share it with your friends because it is SO terrible, that you want them to see it - if only for the reason that you can say to them, \"See what I mean?!?\" - LOLIt is easy to see why this film has risen to cult status. And why the rather GOOD movie, \"The Disaster Artist\", was created in its honor. I hated this movie so much, that I actually loved it. Then why have I rated it only 1 star out of 10? Because it still sucks - Thank you to everyone who have \"indirectly supported\" this review - (fade out to the sound of fire engine sirens blaring ominously in the background....)",

The acting is atrocious from all corners, the directing and script seem to be scenes from rejected movies sewn together only where Doctor Frankenstein produced something intelligent and provocative at least this resembles a bolt-necked, cat headed monstrosity with a left leg where its right arm should be.Too many death analogies? Sure, but what do you expect after 100 painful minutes staring at Tommy Wiseau? The jerky, creepy, inhuman, zombie like dialogue is the first example I've ever seen of human speech plumbing the depths of the uncanny valley. A kid who likes to watch his father figure have sex, (who incidentally has a love interest of his own we never see and a drug problem that amounts to half a scene of padding) a woman with no motivation in life other than to be thoroughly unpleasant in the national leagues, the ridiculous and inexplicable mother with cancer that doesn't seem to be slowing her down much... I could go on. There is no plot to this movie, there is no justification to anything Now we move on to the scenes that give this movie an r Rating, the sex scenes, the saviour of many a bad movie's sales. If you're looking for nudity cloaked by a story you're better off watching that one with the Swedish plumber with the horrendous moustache... or even pride and prejudice. This movie fails on both sex appeal and story. The doughy, fortysomething flesh dragging lethargically over the bed is about as sexy as filling two forty pound bags with meat and slapping them together. I honestly felt a little sick and decided to run a game leaving only the audio track in the background about 10 minutes in.That leaves us with one one question - is it so bad it's good? No. Just no. As previously mentioned this is right there in the uncanny, unfunny, unpleasant trough of any graph of likability you care to draw up. The dialogue is so jarring and stupid you just end up feeling numb and the acting is sub-children's nativity and that's not hyperbole. This movie was so bad RiffTrax actually waived their 'no R rated movies' policy just to cover this train wreck and that should give you an idea of how awful this is.Sorry, Mike and the bots, not even you guys could save this experience from being painful, nauseating and ugly in every sense of the word. How it got a 4/10 I have no idea.",

But not intentionally which makes it everything people talk about. It's re-watchable too. And now that The Disaster Artist is out, it will give you a different take on how you may have thought it was created.No, it's not genius, and far from it. The Room is pure hope, and drive. It's a celebration in lack of talent and direction. It showcases a sense of strange mainstreaming that everyone should at least take note of. Real life is unscripted and random. It can be fun, and the Room is fun!! Tommy Wiseau might be the most authentic protagonist to the abnormality in us all. That's not a bad thing, and we shouldn't be ashamed. We should celebrate our own shortcomings because that's what life is.The Room is so wonderfully awful (as has been said a thousand time before). But it gives us all a reason to spotlight certain traits that make us all special. Enjoy every day, and if it's awful, find a reason to laugh. We only make this journey once, so have fun with it!

None of the actors in this film were believable. The story line was complete drivel. It barely held my interest. I've had more fun watching grass grow.At the end of the movie, just before \"Johnny\" shoots himself over his fianc\u00e9's betrayal, Johnny lifts a TV over his head and throws it out a window. You can easily tell that the TV is fake because Johnny acts like it weighs next to nothing. Any decent actor would at least make it look like it was heavy.I don't understand how so many people can watch this movie and say it was one of the best films they had ever seen.

            "content": "Apparently the aliens from Contact who watch our TV broadcasts and try to find ways to respond to us have been eyeing late night cable drams with \"sin\" or \"temptation\" in the title and this is what they sent back. Or else the kids from the remedial English class got their hands on a camcorder and decided to make an internet sex tape, and the aliens from Contact were watching that...If anybody has a better explanation for how a movie like this, a movie with no conception of human behavior or interactions on any level could exist, I would love to hear it. Even the worst movie makers manage to hit a correct dramatic note every once in a while by sheer statistical accident. But here, the writing and acting manage to fail with such unerring consistency that it is almost an achievement. Words such as 'surreal' do not begin to describe the experience of watching this movie. Its sheer terribleness on every possible creative level exceeds description. If you took ninety minutes of clips from a South American soap opera, spliced them together in random order and got blind street junkies to come with dubbed dialogue, you would still have a more coherent drama. The Room is so totally bad for every moment of its running time that it becomes a master class on cinematic ineptitude. The dialogue is awful, yet the actors still manage to make it seem much worse than it is by mistiming lines and giving inappropriate responses throughout the movie. The pacing of every scene, every exchange, seems off. And despite a reported budget of $6 million (??!) everything looks cheap and hurried, like a film class project that was left to the last minute.The story construction is so inept that almost nothing that happens pushes the story forward, and virtually none of the plot threads get resolved. In fact, most of them are mentioned once and never come up again. Early on, for example, the mother casually discloses that she has cancer, and that is all we ever hear about it. This however is the film's secret virtue. When no plot point is important or connected to anything else in the movie, the viewer is free to play connect the dots.For instance, Johnny's announcement that he failed to get a promotion at his bank shows his underachievement in the financial world. As financiers are sometimes called 'big swinging d*cks', this could be hinting that Johnny is underachieving anatomically as well. This would explain Lisa' perpetual dissatisfaction with him. Or perhaps Lisa' attitude is actually outwardly redirected self-loathing over all of the Weight Watchers meetings she has been missing. Mark's perpetual surprise over how Lisa's undressing indicates that she wants sex and not something else could be masking his own disappointment that she wasn't handing him her clothes to put on for some cross dressing role play. Such disappointment would go far in explaining the sternness of Mark's resistance to her chubby charms. Danny's drug purchase explains his apparent disconnection from reality throughout the film. The kid is clearly on goofballs. Has the mother's cancer spread to her brain? Memory impairment might explain why she keeps having the same conversations over and over. These are all ripe food for thought, and The Room's arthritic pacing gives the viewer plenty of opportunities to toss them around like footballs thrown by guys in tuxedos.",

Having said that, this is the best movie i have seen in quite some time. i nearly defecated just struggling to concentrate on the story???? as i cried with laughter. Before i go any further i feel that i must mention that this movie cost the director SIX MILLION DOLLARS.......To begin, the sexual intercourse scenes are so perfectly timed with the awful r&b music that her climax and repetition of the fine director's buttocks only increase with the crescendo of the music itself. The camera angle through the waterfall is particularly excellent. I also feel that the amount of lines about how beautiful Lisa is has most to do with the fact that she is not in fact beautiful.One of the better traits this movie has to offer is the uncanny ability for every character to immediately explode in anger and then forgive everyone around them. Apparently every character has taken a bit too many steroids and do not know how to control there hormone levels at all. When we do find any conflict the subject is completely swept under the rug and then they have sex. Its like a mixture between a frat party and the real world and confused Asian tourists all combined to create the personality of this cast, then it was filmed. Also i feel that i have to mention that the old lady had breast cancer. This too was immediately forgotten along with the fact that Denny had some sever drug issues. Which in the words of our dear friend Johnny \"hey, that's life\".The intense camera angles and beautiful transition scenes were particularly clever because they only added to the confusion of what this movie was about. To add more confusion, they reused cut scenes and added characters without even telling us who they were, this too was very clever and cost efficient.Toward the end of the movie it really got good. Finally the two men fought over the cheating woman. They made up immediately. Then they fought again, Johnny walked away, and with a brilliant cinematic performance by the director/actor/cheap leather coat from Korea salesman, he trashed the set, touched himself violently but sexually with Lisa's dress and shot himself in the mouth.words will never explain this movie, YOU MUST WATCH THIS",

It gives me more that it is a drama, but the fact is that when the moment arrives at the door, it is not scary and it seems strange to me that everything suddenly becomes so crazy.The actors are like everyone in their world, they are not on par, some crazy others, but of course that can not be.The photograph, I was seeing it and I was imagining the colorist with the program saturating with white. For my taste it has happened, but I've seen that in so many films that are not named as the worst in history.The address, I do not like it, but it does not seem like the worst I've seen.

            "content": "Yes, of course I've seen this film before. This review is kind of just for the books, because I've decided to write my cult film essay on it, so I had to rewatch it.And you probably already know what I'm going to say, including, but not limited to:The acting is pants throughout, from everyone, nearly all the time, but especially the auteur himself, Tommy Wiseau.You could cut out something like two thirds of what passes for this film's \"narrative\" to no effect, because it is casually dropping new plot points and characters that go nowhere and are never heard from again right up until the final scene.It's so poorly directed that I wouldn't be surprised at all if 95% of Tommy's directing was him saying \"okay, now big emotions! Very good, hahahaha\", followed shortly by \"Action!\", and there are absolutely zero interesting shots, unless you count the times that the camera was out of focus.The soundtrack is godawful, sounding straight out of a 1980s straight to video porn, or maybe a 2000s straight to television romcom. Either or.The dialogue is...perfect.The sets are janky, never feel like what they're supposed to be, and feel like they'd fall apart if someone sneezed near them.The characters all act like what a seven year old who somehow knows exactly what things like sex, cancer, and psychiatry are thinks grown up life is like.And the pacing is as slow as a wheelchair on a gravel beach, mostly because of the aforementioned narrative being mostly comprised of characters being introduced and then forgotten about for long enough before the ending to make this feature length.And I absolutely adore it. Seriously, this is one of those films you have to see to believe. If you haven't, don't look up anything else about it. Just go watch it now, because I promise at the very least it will make you feel...something.For me, it soothed the fears I sometimes have of wondering whether I'm too nice/harsh on other films, because when I think about it, a lot of films, even if I think they're bad, do get a lot of things right, or at least competent. I don't tend to mention things like sets or pacing, but that's because a huge amount of films get those things right, so much so that sometimes I feel like I take it for granted. It takes a film this stupendously inept to remind me that if a film does get those things right, that's at least worthy of a little bit of praise.And on the other side of the coin, sometimes when I worry I'm being too nice for a film for having, say, characters that are at least consistent, even if I don't like them, I can think back on a film like The Room to remind myself that, no, that is in fact worth a little bit of credit.And sometimes when I worry that I should be getting on with other work because deadlines are on their way, I can think back on everything I've written here so far and stop dragging this review out.",

A movie about a man who lives in what he think is a happy marriage, but is unaware of what his wife does behind his back and he slowly goes crazy... That could have been a alright melancholic movie. But what we got is something entirely different. And man am I glad over it. This movie is tip-top HILARIOUS! I didn't give it more than 8 because it still has a couple of slow moments, but I still had a smile on my cheek or laughed throughout the majority of the thing. This man had no idea what he was doing. Terrible dialogue, poorly written characters and even small details which just puzzle you. Not to mention the music used for the sex scenes is so godawful you can just shake your head. The lines are weird, they are delivered in a weird way and none of them adds for a dramatic composition. Even though Pulp Fiction is a masterpiece and this is unintentionally hilarious trash, both of those movies has a gastronormous quotability. This is a total landmark in cinema history and there has not been ONE movie more so-bad-it's-good than this one, because this one succeeded on that level in every way.

The Room is a near perfect combination of a variety of badly executed elements coming together and forming a type of masterpiece, albeit accidentally, but still making this movie a spectacular gem nonetheless.The Room oddly and unintentionally maintains a sweet spot of terribleness with such consistency, poise, and authenticity, from the acting, the script, the directing, the wardrobe, the setting, and even the music, that it makes what is truly a dreadful and stupid movie, dreadful and stupid still, yet also remarkable and stupendous.The entire cast, with Tommy Wiseau being an absolute standout amongst a cast of standouts on their own, is a definite joy to watch, from beginning to end. The music, though bad, was more technically bad than actually bad, and the story is an age-old, that in any other movie would have felt clich\u00e9, but in this movie, it felt perfect.Undoubtedly, The Room is a badly made movie, with some scenes and shots that are repeated, sequence of events that are muddled at points, atrocious acting, abandoned sub-plots, and character developments that don't make much sense, but, even with all of its many and complete shortcomings and failures, The Room is fun, funny, and enjoyable throughout, and worth taking seriously to a fair degree, with Tommy Wiseau's very apparent fervor for his pet project, at the heart of this movie, grounding it in memory as a kind of broken masterpiece.8.7/10.P.

            "content": "I really, honestly, from the bottom of my heart feel, that this movie should get a ten star rating. Not on the grounds you would usually praise an, what is called \"artistically achieved movie\", that probably is the result of a controlled work-process and stems from underlying ideas about life, or some reshaped and refined account of certain deep experiences. The Room isn't even, as I was originally tempted to say, fascinating in the sense a natural disaster stuns you and leaves you awe-struck. More closely it resembles something that gets to you by its mere intricate, deeply nested strangeness- like a grotesque commercial that tries to appeal to people by showing something, that is deeply inept to evoke any consumer-reflex, but instead stuns, offends, alienates and consequently exposes the chasm of absurdity that is at its heart. To relate this in a more tangible way, I'll digress a little further by giving an example:I once -I can't remember where- saw some large, battered plastic sculpture, that was supposed to advertise some sausage-stand. It displayed an over-sized, anthropomorphic sausage (wrapped in hot-dog bread, I think) that poured ketchup upon itself and made a monstrously distorted face, that should suggest, I guess, it's enormous craving to devour its own (delicious?) substance (I don't know in which terms a sausage thinks about its own tasty appeals to itself).The point of this is, that such a thing of course does not generate in you impulsive sausage-cravings. Because it doesn't transfer anything about why a sausage maybe tasty- it instead contorts the whole mental picture of a sausage and produces out of it, in this case, an unspeakable being of nightmarish aspect(slight hyperbole there).Exactly the same thing happens in the Room. And though this may sound like a an implausibly bold or ironic statement, it's exactly how I perceive this deranged vision of human conduct, Tommy Wiseau gifted us with. The topics of this film \u2013love, passion, envy, insanity etc.- are as familiar to us, as a sausage(I think this metaphor deserves to be stretched as much as possible). But they get reshaped in this film, so that eventually nothing is in its right place and the persons, whose turmoil is supposed to be displayed, are only resembling human beings in the way a sock-pocket, being waved in your face by a madman, who is shouting: \"Ai don care annymoar!\", does. The initial reaction, to such an affront to humanities grace, is naturally to be disgusted and put off by its grotesque bad- and ineptness. Just unconsciously feel that everything about this is wrong, and consequently damn it. But you need to open up- need to indulge in the infinite detail of stupidity, the unthinkably dense and compressed amounts of absurdity, every fraction of a scene contains. The film really does display a certain self-similarity in this respect: You think a conversation between some characters is embarrassingly moronic, then you zoom in, discover and savor how incoherently the dialogue propagates, zoom in further, see how unworldly, how alien the language of the single remarks is, zoom in to the see the clownish, completely unreasonable facial expressions that tile this flow of human caricature that sprang forth from the seizures that must be Tommy Wiseau's thoughts. So finally you commit yourself to the strange symphony this mythical figure, drenched in mystery, pieced together in its childish mind, allowing you to see the world through the eyes and brains of some sort of holy idiot.",

He wrote, directed, produced, and starred in this unique film, and he carries it. Despite very little acting talent, and fleeting grasp on English, he has an inexplicable screen presence. He is one of those actors you can't take your eyes off of. I can't tell you the number of times I've watched this movie...and I love it every time.My rating of 2 is a measure of the objective quality of the movie, but I assure you, if I were told I would only be allowed to see 5 movies before I died, this would be one of them (also, a middling movie gets no attention...one of the lowest rated films ever will get noticed).

I am obviously not alone in this fascination, as the film has enjoyed a cult status for many years and has recently seem a mocku-docu-drama-whatever insight released with James Franco at the helm. As ridiculous as that film is, it does help shed a light on the backstory of Wiseau himself.As perplexing and morbidly fascinating that Mr. Wiseau is, I cannot shake the feeling that this guy just got lucky. Where he (and his money) came from is still a head-scratching mystery, but casting him or The Room in any sort of light that paints it as purposefully bad, ironic or even artistic is just plain wrong (I saw the awkward character interactions of The Room compared to the works of David Lynch and whilst I drew my own similarities with the surreal or awkward moments, the directors are quite obviously leagues apart). If there was no such thing as meme culture, there would be no career for Tommy Wiseau, and he would most likely just be another dreamer who had a stab at Hollywood and then fell into obscurity.I mean no disrespect to the man, as The Room is incredibly entertaining despite its deathly pace and repetition.

The nonsensical establishing shots, camera angles, unconvincing green screens and sub-plots that seem to never scratch below surface level are a masterpiece, and I'd recommend this film to absolutely everyone. It is a fantastic work of comedy, that is both dark, cringe-worthy and bizarre...all the ingredients to make it a hit in the cult classics hall of fame. The storyline is simplistic, a love triangle between a loving fianc\u00e9e, his unfaithful wife, and his best friend. But the paper thin plot has complete irrelevance in this film, it has no bearing on the fact that this is a marvel for all the wrong reasons. A review cannot explain, or do justice to just how incredible this movie actually is. Just get a copy of this film at all costs...you will not regret it.",

If you can enjoy a film that's so bad it's good, then give this movie a watch; you won't regret it. I actually had to take breaks between the scenes because I was laughing so hard at how awful it was.\nThe film centers on a melodramatic love triangle between amiable banker Johnny (Tommy Wiseau), his deceptive fianc\u00e9e Lisa (Juliette Danielle) and his conflicted best friend Mark (Greg Sestero).\nNobody in this movie is known today for other projects aside from this. Not one person in this movie was good, but Tommy Wiseau is on a whole other level of bad. Not only does his dialogue not make sense in the scenes he is in, but his facial expression and tone don't make what he is saying.\nWhat make the Room superior to all of the 'so bad it's good' films is the fact that it's a riot. You see unlike other films that have 1-2 unintentionally funny scenes and the rest is a bore the Room is a non-stop extravaganza. Literally every scene has something wrong.\nOverall, the fact that \"The Room\" has gathered such a cult following is no surprise. There is something both pathetic and a little unsettling about how Tommy Wiseau regards the cynical interests his movie has attracted for a genuine recognition of his talent.\n.5/5",

I can see why a film was made by James Franco and co essentially mocking the process this film went through to be made. I don't think Tommy Wiseau to this day realizes this!

A messily scripted and poorly acted display of irritating accents and painfully awkward sex scenes, The Room is pretty much only good for a laugh. I mean that in the nicest way possible. No. Not really. After watching this film, I am left unsatisfied with the pretty much nonexistent plot and disturbing amount of goofs involved in it. Specifically, the flower shop scene. It is as if the actors only had 45 seconds to film the scene, and they had never looked at their lines and just read over them a couple of times before rushing on set. There are so many things wrong with this movie, including but not limited too the amount of times that Johnny says \"Hi\" to any given person, particularly Mark, and the awkward laugh that Johnny seems to force from his throat at the strangest times, including just before one of those terrible sex scenes. Despite my bad review, I would not say that my time spent watching The Room was wasted. I recommend this film in the highest regard. It's so bad that it's good! It is fantastic for having a night getting drunk with your friends, or to get one of your emotional friends to smile after a breakup. Enjoy this terribly wonderful film.",

            "content": "After many at home viewings of THE ROOM and one particularly awesome theater experience - and by awesome I mean experiencing a movie with audience participation in a way I had never before encountered: audience participation that genuinely enhanced the experience of watching an already immensely entertaining work (and that's a rare kind of awesome). I can only conclude that THE ROOM is my personal favorite film to be experienced in a group setting, my favorite film to introduce to people, and probably just my favorite film to sit down and watch all on my lonesome.First, what it's all about... It's a story about a man named JOHNNY who is a good person living in a world of devious people. His good intentions and simple, sweat dreams of a happy life begin to fall apart as those around him abuse his good nature; his loyalty, his giving, charitable spirit, and most painful of all his manipulation at the hands of his love Lisa. His betrayal through the sudden onset unfaithfulness of his beautiful bride to be is the driving force of the room: A good person surrounded by such undeserved pressures results in a film that is ultimately a view into the emotional and physical destruction of the character JOHNNY - an everyman, of sorts - as his friends, his lover, his job, and finally his grip on reality betray him.It's a dark film, but with many light moments as interesting, quirky characters drift into THE ROOM and JOHNNY's life, bringing with them unique personal situations, problems, and other glimpses into young, modern urban life in America. These flashes of brightness and Americana drama serve as a backdrop to the exacerbating suffering of our Hero.THE ROOM is a story of betrayal and loss, weaved in to a world of colorful, compelling characters. It is the saddest drama; it is the blackest comedy; it is the saddest love story. It's a lot of things, all of which you should see. Once you are 5 minutes into the film, you cannot turn away. It's a museum quality example of independent film in the United States.And yes, I should mention something of the acting, writing, sets and such. The performances and staging are poor compared to studio films. But the experience is incomparable in any context. Go buy this movie at AMAZON, setup a THE ROOM party night and experience the work for yourself.",

But unlike ROCKY HORROR (which despite bombing in its initial release, has some high quality in both acting and songs/dancing and remains relevant to this day), THE ROOM is a certifiable piece of crap from the opening scene to the bitter end. And also unlike ROCKY HORROR, I really doubt the main actors of THE ROOM will still have any sort of show-biz careers in the near future, let alone 35 years later.But I had to see it, if for nothing else see just what was behind the creepy Tommy Wiseau \"mug shot\" used in on the cover, which of course was prominently displayed on an L.A. billboard for several years. I did make it through to end, but it sure helped to be reading snarky reviews of it on IMDb while the train wreck was playing. And the fact Wiseau seems to have worse skin than Andy Warhol did, and felt compelled to give us a \"full-backal\" view of said skin, made it all the more hilarious. And for the unintentional comedy, I'm \"awarding\" it an extra star in my rating.I guess my only recommendation is, if you must see THE ROOM, check it out at a midnight \"participation screening\". Watch it at home, and you'll feel like you're trapped in a specific room, and that room is known universally as hell.",

You had fans dressing up as the stars of \"The Room\" with wigs, beards, etc. It's funny that the line \"You're tearing me apart!\" got such an applause considering it's a classic line from the James Dean film \"Rebel Without a Cause\" from 1955. Being from Indiana, I am a huge James Dean fan and the delivery of that line by Johnny (Tommy Wiseau) was a disgrace. However, the other actor in the film who played Mark (Greg Sestero) was the most impressive part of this cult phenomenon. Greg Sestero had that brooding, sensitive and subtle performance that us \"James Dean\" fans enjoy. He was real, cool, and wasn't trying to \"act\" like every other actor in the movie. I was amazed at his prescence on film and how beautiful he was on screen. The rest of the cast was fun I guess, especially Denny. Lisa was miscast and tried way too hard to be the \"it girl\" and the soundtrack was so out of place that I have no comment. This film is fun and crazy.

The one-man powerhouse behind this production, Tommy Wiseau, is an enigma of an individual. The details of his background and how he got into making this film are a complete mystery, some of which is uncovered in Greg Sestero's memoir, The Disaster Artist, now adapted into a feature film.The Room is filled with red herrings, aborted plot lines and is one of those films that has to be seen to be believed. Wiseau plays Johnny, a well-meaning \"American\" banker. He loves his \"future wife\", Lisa who is revealed to be a manipulative golddigger who starts an affair with Johnny's \"best friend\" Mark. From there, it's just a flurry of unexplored plot threads that are forgotten just as quickly as they're brought up. (breast cancer, drug money, family problems, etc.) The tonal inconsistencies are ongoing and it only adds to this trainwreck of a movie.All of that aside, the whole thing is incredibly intriguing and only makes you want to know more about the bizarre individual that is Wiseau. Having read The Disaster Artist, the production of this film is the definition of \"dysfunctional.\" However, there's a strange passion that shines through that really shows Wiseau's commitment to the project.A cult classic, heavily quotable and has garnered huge popularity over the years, The Room continues to be one of the \"best worst movies ever made.\" I'm getting tired of having to correct people when they assume I'm talking about the Oscar-nominated \"Room\", though.",

Of course this is what makes the movie fantastic, but my favorite thing about The Room is seeing Tommy's sheer enjoyment while making it. Tommy was truly passionate while making this project, and cared about every scene that was shot, even if he did it in all the wrong ways. Many directors today could care less about the impact their films have, and are only looking for a quick buck. Tommy on the other hand was looking to deliver a dramatic masterpiece to his audience. He instead created something much different, but it still has become insanely popular. Tommy wound up famous, and although his film is technically terrible, I have to applaud him for his effort and determination while making this film.If you have not witnessed The Room, I would recommend checking it out as soon as possible. It's definitely a life altering experience and Tommy will be on your mind for some time after your viewing. In the words of Mr. Wiseau himself.. \"I'm fed up with this woarld\".",

            "content": "It is April fool's day and Adult Swim is showing \"The Room\" again. It debuted there a few years ago. They said they were going to show something else, I recorded it and the next day watched it and it wasn't what they claimed. Instead they played \"The Room\" as a joke. That is when I first saw it. They have showed it every year since then.It is quite literally the worst movie ever made. It was written/directed/produced and stars Tommy Wiseau. The worst movie maker and actor ever to exist.\"Plan Nine From Outer Space\" was often considered to be the worst movie ever made until this came along. \"Plan\" had the last performance of Bela Lugosi, playing a vampire. He died before the movie was finished and he was replaced by an actor that just lurked around with his cape covering his face. Their spaceship set was a desk with a curtain behind it. I think \"The Room\" easily and honestly wins the title. (By the way Ed Wood made \"Plan\" and some of the other worst movies ever made. Tim Burton made a movie about him called, of course, \"Ed Wood\" which is great, watch that if you haven't.)You must see this movie. If you don't, your life will not be complete and you will die with a hole in your soul.I have seen a lot of movies. Most of them I forget about unless they are something very special, like \"A Clockwork Orange\" or \"Star Wars\" or \"Saving Private Ryan\". I will never forget those movies and what they did to me. They changed my life. This movie did the same thing. It is unforgettable. It is a masterpiece of awfulness. I will remember it until I die. There is just something special about it that lifts if from just plain bad, to something that is unbelievable. It is hypnotic. Every moment from beginning to end is like a test to see if you can withstand another second of it. If you can, you will reach a higher plane, a sort of nirvana. If you can do it you will become a different person with a greater understanding of yourself and the world around you. It is that bad. See it as soon as possible.",

This movie is not only bad in terms of acting and storyline, but there are regular inconsistencies and technical problems that range from blurry picture to a terrible green screen. It seems that the cast has risen out of obscurity due to the cult following, and they are milking their 15 seconds of fame. I don't blame them. If I were to list the problems with the movie, I'm sure I would go over the maximum review length. Needless to say, this is a head-scratchingly bad movie that is thoroughly enjoyable as you wonder who would put this much effort into something this bad.

In a burst of alcohol-fueled energy he bats out a script called \"The Room\" in one night. Then, casting the script with mostly porn movie actors and himself, he produces, directs, shoots, edits and releases his 'masterpiece' without ever deviating from that first draft. That's what this thing looks like---the product of a decidedly minor talent with a full blown ego who either fired every person who tried to point out the \"garbage in, garbage out\" rule to him from day one, or who just hired a bunch of people who didn't care and were just happy to get a paycheck.And don't buy into the \"so bad it's good' excuse with this one. It's so bad, it's literally impossible to remain focused on it. It's why remote controls were invented.To sum up this steaming pile if cinematic achievement; It's 99 minutes of your life you will never get back.",

Since then I have hosted over 8 Room screenings at my house. My friends and I can't stop quoting it and singing the songs. We have learned so many lessons, such as how to play football in small spaces, the powers of persuasion and seduction, the art of interior decorating, and finally how to catch your cheating lover. In all honesty, this isn't the prime example of exemplary acting, writing, cinematography, directing, musical composition, or editing, but as long as you have a good group of friends, a couple of skotchkas and a great sense of humor, you will have fun watching the movie.

            "review_title": "The Room",
            "content": "The Room is the movie based on the book and theater piece by Tommy Wiseau, American immigrant and retail park manager, who wants to immortalize his romantic life, sexual hatreds and obsessions into a dark, twisted drama of betrayal. Its also a film that's so badly acted and produced that its generally hilarious.There's nothing really \"cool\" about the Room, as some cult movies actually are, its just a story of an honest, though somewhat creepy looking finance worker, who's almost-plump suburban girlfriend Lisa has plans to run off with the guy upstairs. The rest of the cast is: Lisa's mother, a vengeful sexual predator with breast cancer and Denny, a wholesome American sitcom teen that wants to watch Johnny (Wiseau's on screen character) and Lisa having sex. Denny's also got some underhanded goings-on with a local thug involving narcotics, something that unravels dramatically on their buildings rooftop where much of the films conflict scenes get especially fiery.Two points: this movie is filled with SEX, also its FUNNY AS SH*T, because the cast can't act and the plot points are all confused or very badly telegraphed.Its also worth 'splaining that Denny is sort of a surrogate \"little brother\" to Johnny, as he has no family of his own. Each scene sets Johnny up as selfless, idealistic, and an nurturing, except for one major event where he tries to fry Lisa for framing him for domestic abuse.The movie cost a freakin' bundle: writer/producer/director/star Wiseau commissioned a steamy R&B track for the movie, and his crew an assorted costs crept into the millions, plus billboard advertising to promote his project. Clearly, they didn't have the basic technical know-how for getting the best from their equipment; the most telling sign being the visible interlacing throughout the film.I won't spoil the ending, but I can add that personally, when I first found this film, I laughed uncontrollably for about a week and a half. Maybe a year or so later I returned to the movie, and it appeared to be littered with filler scenes, except for a few great one-liners. In a sense the film satirizes the fascination with love, betrayal and the sacred rite of bland, secure suburban fulfillment that's at the heart of a lot of TV drama and soap story lines. Its a funny movie, but mostly by accident apparently.A computer game and paperback novel detailing the films troubled production is available also.",

If you didn't have fun watching \"The Room\" multiple times with other enthusiastic fans, then that is your loss. There are so many enjoyable moments in this movie that a few flaws are inconsequential. The fact is, Tommy Wiseau's intention was to provoke the audience, and he has succeeded beyond anyone's expectations. In fact, on one who was involved in the production of this movie expected the audiences to react as they have except the director Tommy Wiseau. There are so many little interesting tidbits in each scene and so many emotional moments and ironies that \"The Room\" is entertaining from start to finish. If you have any doubts about this, get a DVD of the Audience Reactions..The fans are having great time with their impression of there favorite lines, such as \"You are tearing me a part, Lisa!\", \"If a lot of people love each other, the world would be a better place to live.\", \"Hi, doggie!\", \"Chocolate is a symbol of love.\" Also some fans are dressing like characters in the movie and tossing a football to each other during the movie. Now, I call that fun!Many people have commented that the beautiful San Francisco scenery makes them want to go there. As for me, it reminds me of the time I have been there. It's perfect setting for the plot of \"The Room,\" because the characters are sophisticated and affluent.I would like to recommend if the whole thing didn't grab you the first time, see it again, and again, and again, and again, and again and you will never be tired of seeing it!!!!!",

My university hosted a screening of this to mark the beginning of Finals Week for the Fall 2018 semester, and wow, was this one of the best \"theater\" experiences I have ever had in my life. It was loud, full of screams, gags at all off the sex scenes, and tons of amazing laughter. I was literally crying in some parts at how funny both the film and the audience was.I would highly recommend watching The Room by yourself or with a couple of friends for the first time, and then watch the film with a large audience. The audience's participation with this film made this one of the most enjoyable experiences I have ever had. It was so incredibly fun.As for The Room, it is an incredibly funny film that tries to depict a love triangle, but fails in every single way. The film tries to be emotional, but you can't help but laugh at everything. The lines of dialogue are overtly against females, as Tommy Wiseau delegates women as mere sex objects who want to just use men for their own personal gain. Regardless, the script doesn't make him sound like a douchebag because you can hardly decipher what he is saying anyways. There is an overabundance of sex scenes, with the same scene being used again and again. There are random subplots involving a college student named Denny, who wants to have a threesome with his father figure, Johnny, and mother figure, Lisa. There are photos of spoons in the background. There is a love of football found throughout the film, etc.All in all, The Room is just a lot of random. And about 90 percent of it, is just absolutely hilarious. There is a small 10 percent of the film in the middle that was kind of boring, but the rest is amazing.Please watch this film. And as some of you may know, my ratings for my films are like sixty percent based off of enjoyment, and forty percent of quality. I sincerely enjoyed this film to the max, so hence the three stars, or six out of ten.Given the incredibly insane backstory, I need to hope onto The Disaster Artist train as soon as possible.",

I believe it still shows in theaters in the US on a regular basis where these followers flock together, imitating their favorite characters, so eventually the movie will make a profit.

The main character Johnny (Tommy, also director/producer/auteur) looks and sounds like an alien from another planet, rejected by \"Star Trek\" as too weird.And yet, the whole thing is oddly mesmerizing, like a car wreck you can't help but stare at.

Tommy Wiseau really did see his big screen dream come true. Honestly, he might be the worst actor, writer, and directer ever. He wrote this film to be a true romantic tragedy. Johnny, Lisa, and Mark are all caught in a love triangle that could unravel any friendship. Johnny is madly in love with his fianc\u00e9 Lisa, but she is having doubts on the marriage, and decides to seduce Johnny's best friend Mark. Not really an original thought. The story itself is fully of clich\u00e9s that keep getting repeated. The characters are beyond terrible and the actors portraying them are historic in their awful portrayals.

At first, I dismissed it saying that it was laughably bad (which it still is today). As I watched again and again, I slowly got more and more intrigued by its symbolism. Imagine : A weird, tall man with a creepy accent and girly, long, curly black hair. An incredibly and unabashedly unfaithful fianc\u00e9e. A friend whose friendship is questionable due to his actions of betrayal. An innocent-looking kid who gets involved with things much darker for anyone's taste. The fianc\u00e9e's ever-inquisitive yet moral mother. These are not just the complex characters of 'The Room', but a small part in everyone's mind.I read somewhere that Tommy Wiseau used to be a psychologist, and so it would seem only natural for him to make a film of this nature, with disturbingly complex characters, and the small, seemingly irrelevant but impactful situations they are put in. Johnny's weird accent, Denny's random perversions, Lisa's utter lack of shame, and Mark's true innocence, are not just the characteristics of the characters, but they are all part of one's MIND.After I watched 'The Room' many times, I realized why the characters always acted and reacted weirdly. I understood the seemingly pointless scenes and what they ACTUALLY meant. The film is a surreal account of one's inner MIND.Thank you, Tommy Wiseau, for this cruelly misunderstood masterpiece of a film.",

This is next level terrible. Tommy Wiseau's vanity project, this Tennessee Williams-wannabe nonsense is so terrible that mere words aren't enough to describe it.The plot, if you want to call it that, is contrived nonsense that features more sex scenes in the first half hour than in some Skinemax flicks, and overlong dialogue in desperate need of editing. There are scenes that go nowhere, lots of conversation that is meaningless, and characters that are underdeveloped and whose appearances make no sense.If you like long shots of San Francisco, this is definitely the movie for that. Most films use one or two expository shots, adding more if the film is picking up from a specific spot in a city, but for a long time, this movie stays primarily in the apartment, and has its characters engage in repetitive, meaningless conversation, like a cancer diagnosis being blown right past with no reaction from either character in the scene.Watching the Rifftrax version of this film is the only way it is watchable. That is an easy 10/10, and even as an MST3K fan, I've not laughed that hard in a long time.On its own, this movie is a pointless slog that needed someone to seriously check Tommy Wiseau's ego. It's horribly unwatchable, nothing happens of consequence until the birthday party, so that's an hour of time you can easily bypass and miss nothing, and the only real highlight for me is when Johnny blows his own head off. That itself should say everything about The Room.That said, I feel like The Disaster Artist will be a great telling of the making of this movie, as it's clear there had to be a lot of wacky shenanigans going on behind the scenes, and I'm looking forward to seeing how they played out.But the movie itself? Ye gads. Horrible. But I'll re-watch the Rifftrax version over and over again, no doubt about that.",

This is one of the funniest bad movies I have ever seen and I don't even drink alcohol. This movie is actually funnier than the Ed Wood movies that I have seen.\nThe acting is corny at best and bizarrely funny at worst. There are three sex scenes, one in which the music skips. One of my hobbies is reviewing bad movies, I specialize in panned comedy movies actually. I would not recommend very many of the movies that I watch to my friends but I would recommend this one, especially in a group setting.\nThe sheer ineptness of the plot, script, and especially the acting is staggering. As far as the actual content goes you will find so much weird stuff in this movie. In one scene it shows what three or four people ahead of Johnny (the lead character) orders in a coffee shop. Why? I have no idea and neither will you. There are numerous scenes where Johnny and Mark throw a football back in forth for fun and one has them all in tuxedos! Why? Again, I have no idea and neither will you. The movie can be a bit depressing at times I suppose but the unintentional humor will likely have you laughing so hard that this will matter very little.\nThis is a one of a kind cinematic experience.

It is an abject and aggressive failure on every conceivable level: costumes, score, acting, script, editing. And yet you must see it! Tommy Wiseau, the director, is a finger-painter who thought he was creating the Mona Lisa and accidentally drew the world's funniest and most wildly popular picture of a willy.At the end of the day, you have to rate any creative endeavour based on how well it achieves its intended goals and that's why, with a very heavy heart, I must award The Room one solitary star. This star is awarded for the act of existing, and I present it out of sheer charity. If enjoyment could only be derived from an appraisal of technical skill, the only thing worse than this train crash of a film would be watching it on a crashing train.But if you were to rate the experience of this movie it would get ten stars. Easy. The Room is unintentionally one hundred of the most riotously fun minutes out there and will propel you full-force into a state of hilarious insanity.",

            "content": "I am among those people who watched \"The Room\" to get ready for the \"Disaster Artist\", featuring James Franco. I was ready to be confronted with the so-called worst movie ever, but what I saw is completely different: this movie is a true work of art, for many reasons.1. The plot - to whoever says the plot is weak or unconvincing, this is a plot that has the simplicity and the mediocrity of the real life - characters who are just okay, a life that is just okay. Which is not bad, on the contrary : it perfectly portrays our mediocre, prosaic human life. 2. Cinematography - Though I agree the scenario could look better, the music score is perfect for the movie, I'd say David Lynchesque somehow, especially during the dramatic scenes. It sets a kitsch yet creepy tone that makes this movie so unique. 3. Symbology - Lisa always wears a black piece of clothing when she's cheating on Johnny. Also, the red color dress that he gives to her symbolizes sacrifice, he wants her to give all her love to him, and at the same time, the union with Johnny feels like a terrible sacrifice to her. The football scenes represent the bonding between the male characters. All good characters are dark-haired and all psychopathic characters are light-haired, which is a good twist that makes this movie different and refuses to follow the \"blonde guys are good, dark-haired guys are bad\" stereotype. 4. Edition - one particular thing that really drew my attention and puts this movie among one the most amazing of all times is the deliberate repetition of the sex scenes between Johnny and Lisa. A clever yet subtle way to demonstrate how repetitive and prosaic was their relationship. Also, there are no time indicators in this movie. One scene jumps right next to the other, without actually impacting the understanding of the plot. 5. Characters - we see in Lisa a psychopath in its true form. Also, her relationship with her mother is a brilliant detail of this movie because it shows exactly where Lisa's psychopathic tendencies came from - her mother, who believes Lisa should only stay engaged to Johnny because he gives her money. The two women are so psychopathic that even when the mother talks about her breast cancer, the daughter is completely blas\u00e9 about it, while the mother is in completely denial as well. Mark, on the other hand, is an opportunistic man who wanted to keep friends with Johnny because of his money and influence, and yet wanted to keep having sex with Lisa. He victimizes himself the whole movie trying to pretend \"he was seduced\" by the \"manipulative bitch\", refusing to take responsibility for his acts. Johnny, on the other hand, is the quirky yet naive man who just wants to be love and share his feelings with the world. You can see he has some personality disorder by looking at his insecurity and his mannerisms. He's extremely attached to people, which unfortunately led to his suicide. 6. Ending - there could never be a more realistic and nihilistic ending than this. Not even Lars von Trier or David Lynch could reach this kind of brutal and nihilistic ending without looking pretentious or over-the-top. Johnny's death is a punch in the viewer's face, and a reality check. I truly and sincerely think this is one of the BEST MOVIES I have ever seen, so clever, unique and unpretentious in all forms. This deserves to be praised alongside with Amadeus, Taxi Driver, Scarface and many others unpretentious yet great masterpieces of cinema.",

The writing in this movie is absolutely fantastic and the performances are absolutely breathtaking. Dialogue like \"You're tearing me apart, Lisa!\" has so much emotion and depth to it. I was crying when I was watching this movie. That's how good it was. Tommy Wiseau, Greg Sestero, Juliette Danielle and everyone else in the movie give excellent performances and are WAY better actors than actors like Marlon Brando, Daniel Day-Lewis and Robert De Niro. Those 3 actors absolutely terrible at acting. Tommy Wiseau is a masterful actor, director, writer and producer.

With quotes such as 'hi Mark' being said in such an exquisite fashion I uncontrollably zone out of reality and fully entice myself within the untouchable complete perfect cinematic experience.On to the next point the cinematography, having to rewatch the same angle on almost every sex scene through a window is just one of the multiple brilliant ideas that Tommy Winseua has used to make this film compete along side other top tier movies, and if that wasn't enough well he also made sure to add lots of necessary green screens such as when they are on the roof to give that extra thrilling action to the overall eye sex of a film.To sum up my review on the film the only true word I can use to describe this is unwatchable.",

If you ever get a chance to go see a screening of this film and meet the man who created it, I would highly recommend it. Even if you have watched this film 20 or so times.

Also if you are reading this you have either already seen it or are planning to give it a go anyway. And I would encourage you if you haven't already to experience this piece of bizarro genius at least once especially if you're a cinephile. It truly is unlike anything else you will ever see. It might not be possible to make a more uproariously funny unintentional comedy than 'The Room'. Tommy Wiseau, the financier, producer, director, writer and star of this movie poured heart, soul and all of his passion into this disaster-piece. From the atrocious acting to the laughable dialogue to the inexplicably abandoned subplots to the women stereotypes, virtually every scene elicits thunderous laughter from the audience. What might be even funnier is when you find out that Wiseau intended the film to be a Tennessee Williams level drama. And there are obvious allusions to the melodramas of the 1950's/60's with stolen lines like 'You are tearing me apart!' taken directly from Nicholas Ray's 'Rebel Without a Cause' but without any of the context and spun into hilarity.What is truly remarkable about 'The Room' is how it has sustained for this long and how it became a cult classic. There are tons of bad movies that get released every single year and fade into obscurity but not this one. No, not 'The Room'. It has even managed to make its ridiculously high budget of $6 Million back after countless midnight screenings worldwide since it first came out in 2003. You see what sets this particular awfully bad movie apart from other awfully bad movies is that it never feels like Tommy Wiseau is not trying to make something special. And make something special he did with what is now widely known as 'The Citizen Kane of bad movies'.If you want to find out more about 'The Room' and how it was made then check out the book 'The Disaster Artist' written by Greg Sestero, the actor who plays Mark in the movie and Tommy's real life best friend, and journalist Tom Bissell. Then go watch the adaptation of the book, which keeps the same name, directed by and starring James Franco as Tommy Wiseau. It also stars Franco's brother Dave as Greg Sestero and a plethora of other recognizable faces such as Seth Rogen, Alison Brie and Paul Scheer. The movie is garnering a lot of awards buzz and at this point in time has been nominated for two Golden Globes including Best Picture (Musical or Comedy) and Best Actor (Musical or Comedy) for James Franco. Its going to be truly surreal seeing Tommy Wiseau finally attending these awards shows in the coming months, something which he thought 'The Room' would allow him to do all those years ago. Instead he had to wait for a great movie to be made about his terrible movie.",

When I sat down to watch the room for the first time, with much anticipation, it was everything I was looking for-- A movie so bad that it was actually good. My favorite part of the movie is the blatant disregard for truth i.e. \"Lisa is so beautiful\" is repeated every other line when she clearly needs to cut back on the blue eyeshadow and lose a few lbs before she can be labeled \"beautiful. \" Despite the plot holes, bad acting, and bizarre sex scenes the film is so unintentionally hilarious that I can't imagine leaving the theater without a smile. I highly recommend watching it at a midnight showing sometime, highly worth it. 9 out of 10 stars, after watching the movie I will definitely return and become a \"roommate.\"",

The Room is so astonishingly terrible and the writing is so open-handed that it almost becomes a character study of him. You see how he views America, what he views as a normal 'american' friendship as they toss footballs in a alleyway over and over again, and you even get a sense of his past and his views on women with his portrayal of Lisa as a character. Despite being a R-Rated film, there's almost a child-like obliviousness to this film with how characters have unexplainable mood-swings and one-dimensional personality traits.While its attempting to be a tragic story, The Room is so abysmally bad at what its trying to convey it loops around to being the perfect comedy. The performances leave nothing to be desired because the pure insanity behind the script and their acting creates scenes that are truly unforgettable; and when the film manages to accomplish something good, whether it be the grande & epic score or the occasional good looking shot. You will be impressed with the little things it sometimes gets right admist the flames of a terrible movie.If you are studying film, watch this movie and watch / read The Disaster Artist. Everything falls apart so magically that it not only creates a unforgettable viewing experience, but one that emphasizes the importance of a strong and unified team. If you feel your production is anything like The Room, then run away as soon as you can.",

It inspired me to get up everyday and be happy that I wasn't \"that guy\" who made the (possible) worst movie in recent history. And you know what? It's not even the worst movie ever, I recently watched Shutter Island and I couldn't even get through that but this movie made me curious on what funny line or bad acting would happen next. I was literally brought to tears of joy reading the reviews of this film after watching this movie. I gave this movie a 2 STAR rating. 1 for it's quality of...everything, and 1 for making my week!! I haven't laughed so hard recently. Yes, I realize that this isn't even exactly a full on review; it's more of how over joyed I'm feeling right now that I can make it in life. Simply said: This movie is so bad...it's good.Chip chip chip!!!!!",

It can be said that comedy cannot be comedy if it is forced, it must be spontaneous to be real comedy. There is no way this movie was originally intended to be bad like this, it took a work of mad genius to create this.And it is mad. Most of the \"dialogue\" is exposition. Characters are described by others and not shown who they are through what they do. Everything's incorrect about filming. I'm not a film student or anything but there's a certain feel about when it's correct in a place of dialogue to cut to the other person. There's a way people interact that's natural, even with bad lines. But these lines are not just delivered badly, they're insane! It's almost indescribable. After viewing this, I've struggled to find other bad movies that are so entertainingly hilarious but I seem to end up just finding boring-unengaging junk, such as battlefield earth. Foodfight! seems like another contender. Usually filmmakers are admonished for churning out bad movies but this movie deserves an applause. I was literally screaming and howling through this. So many \"what just happened?!\" moments. And that flower shop scene, wow. Possibly the pinnacle of film making. And why does this feel like a bad mid 90's made for TV movie? Everyone and everything seemed 90's. Go see this movie!",

His \"sexy\" girlfriend is overweight and sits around like a third-rate porn star. I can't really tell why the odd college boy is even here except to get in trouble for buying drugs and to have some sort of weird man-crush on Johnny. The \"best friend\" doesn't even know how Johnny met his girlfriend of 7 years, the same one he is having an affair with. Every time she slips out of her Walmart blouse, he exclaims with great surprise, \"Hey! What's going on here?\" There really is no reason for anything that happens in this movie to happen. Dialogue is trite, nobody seems to have a purpose for being where they are or saying what they say. Everyone acts like they barely know one another (e.g. lovers, best friends, mother and daughter all behave very awkwardly around each other). One friend, the psychologist just disappears. The mother announces she has breast cancer and no one really cares, including her. Grown men toss a football four feet from one another. No reason.Probably the very worst parts are the nude scenes with Tommy Wiseau. I mean, seriously, how nauseating does he have to make this already abysmal film.

But, before I watched this film, I heard somewhere on YouTube and saw the title \"The Room\" so I assumed it was just some crappy horror film and forgot about it. I had no idea who Tommy Wiseau was, until The Disaster Artist came out. So as you can guess, I got curious. And I watched the film. It was NOT what I thought it was. It was just so weird and odd. It's not just Tommy Wiseau who's odd, every actor in this film seems odd. The film is about a successful banker named Johnny (Tommy Wiseau) who live happily in San Francisco with his fianc\u00e9e, or \"future wife\" Lisa (Julliete Dannielte). Until she gets board for no reason, and cheats on him with his best friend Mark (Greg Sestro). From there on, nothing will be the same.This is one of those films where it's so bad it's good. And I am a big fan of this movie and can't stop watching it. Tommy Wiseau himself has stated that this film was always meant to be a comedy, so I guess it was never actually meant to be taken seriously.Now, I've talked a lot about the bad stuff, but let's talk about the good stuff.I think the reason why people still watch this film is because it brings people together. All over the world there's midnight screenings of it and people love it and laugh together and throw footballs to each other. It's very funny and I highly recommend it.When I watch The Room today, and don't see a funny cult classic. I see a reflection of an odd but very talented man who had a very clear vision and wanted to share it with the world. I think one thing I love about Tommy Wiseau is, he dosen't care what other people think, and I really respect him for that. So I'll end this review with a quote by Tommy Wiseau.\"You can laugh, you can cry, but please don't hurt each other\" - Tommy Wiseau",

Wiseau, a new and mysterious presence on the Hollywood film making scene, produced and stars as the lead in this roller coaster ride of emotions which run the gamut from hysterical laughter to gut wrenching guilt. Wiseau spoof's the Hollywood love story. It's a campy version of a Tennessee Williams film with a little John Waters thrown in. He wants everyone to see themselves. The lead actress is every guy's nightmare with a sexual taste for your best friend. This is a story about a nymphomaniac with great breasts and the victim who is clueless about her scattered sexual outlook about men. Worth seeing.

The best part about it, if anything, was the fact that that tool blew his brains out at the end. I only wish that could have happened in the first two minutes.In a film, people are supposed to act. I think the people in this film try to, but it doesn't work. Maybe the point of the whole thing was to show how not to make a film? Hmm...Tommy Wiseau, your 15 minutes were done and gone after you appeared on Tim and Eric Awesome Show Good Job! (people with talent). See, in T&E ASGJ, when people act poorly, it's funny because they don't make an attempt at seriousness. You did, and it was just pathetic. So try harder or better yet, just go away.And Adult Swim, you suck for airing that crap in the first place. Stick to what works. Like Family Guy.",

Get the movie, put it on and be prepared to laugh right away. i laughed when i saw the credits. One guy (Tommy Wiseau) had so many roles from Producer, Director, Writer and LEAD ACTOR!!! and for those who want to know who Tommy Wiseau is, well, just imagine a creepy looking paper white guy with long black hair. he looks like someone you would try to get away from on a Subway due to his creepy look. his acting though is just so awful that it's funny. if someone told me that English is his first language, i would laugh because the way he reads his lines is like watching a 5 year old reading a dictionary. he's got to be the worst lead actor in a movie and it's the reason it's funny is because you got to remember that he's badly acting and saying lines that HE WROTE!!!as for the movie itself, if you like sex scenes, sex talks with VERY little plot with the exception of a cheating woman and lots of footballs being thrown, then you'll like it.Get this movie just for the simple fact that Tommy's character is funny from his bad acting to even his mocking chicken line!! he can't even get a chicken noise right!!",

Then we got a gratuitous sex scene that lasted way to long, then we saw Lisa talking to her mother about how she doesn't love him anymore, then she cheats on Johnny with his best friend, and soon I noticed a pattern happening in the plot. Gratuitous sex scene, Lisa talks to mother, Lisa cheats with Mark, rinse and repeat. Eventually the story does go somewhere, without flagging myself for spoilers, let's just say it has an unintentionally hilarious grand finale. Although Wiseau is the most hilariously awful actor, because of the repetition of plot, and the super cynical nature of this movie I didn't like it as well as other bad movies.",

While initially ridiculed by the viewing public, The Room later attained cult status for its consistently uninspired scripting and second-rate acting. The peculiar constancy of its grade-B qualities derives from Wiseau's East-European origins, origins which bestowed a subtle, but pervasive cultural dysfluency that bled over not only onto his screen play, but also onto his spoken lines. The flattened affect attendant on this dysfluency gives The Room an aura of incompetence and a soap-opera-like character. The Room ultimately inspired the 2017 movie, The Disaster Artist, which details the story behind Tommy Waseau and the making of The Room.",

            "content": "I have seen this movie twice, and it grows on you. The characters are endearing are you get caught up in their affection for one another and their togetherness. It is something that many men can identify  with from their past or have to look forward to in their future. Some men will keep this as their secret. It clearly shows the timeless triangle of the friendship between two men brought down and completely destroyed by a beautiful, remorseless and deceitful woman using sex and co-dependency as her lethal weapons.The character, Johnny, is so endearing in his complete  trust of his finance,the beautiful Lisa. Johnny is a very sweet and trusting man .The director really missed many  heart stopping moments  that were lost, because of rushing through the scenes that were very loaded with tension and should have been played out to the max. There should have been longer heart stopping pauses, but instead the moment was lost by rushing through the scenes that were exploding with  sexual tension. There were several of these such instances at Johnny's surprise birthday party when everyone was all around having a good time laughing and not knowing how volatile the situation in the room was. The movie really missed it by not exploiting this to the fullest. This was what the whole movie had been building up to. There was so much sexual tension between the unfaithful Lisa and Johnnie's cheating friend, Mark. The air was riveting and charged with the buildup from the start of  the whole movie. The directors should have really made a big deal of long, tension filled, up close eye contact, between Lisa and Mark. Mark was definitely not thinking with his brain. These looks and tensions could have been played out  and underscored so much more.I was disappointed this huge opportunity was barely tapped. This was my biggest disappointment about the entire movie. There should have been more exchange tension filled looks between Lisa and Mark, Mark and Johnnie, and others that knew, but mostly between Lisa and Mark, and the camera should have let time stand still with a close up of the emotion in Lisa and Mark's eyes. Everyone would squirm as the whole party of friends stood in the circle awaiting..... the bomb to explode.....how..... and with whom????? Let the tension exist and prolong it so we all get our money's worth for the.... climax.Lisa was completely  spontaneous, unpredictable and with no inhibitions to get what she wanted..... wherever she wanted it. Even Lisa's mother could not believe how remorseless her daughter was.This movie gets better each time you see it.  All the characters are so endearing you feel like you are actually there with them and they are your friends. Each character is special. There are heart stopping moments of suspense when you think Johnny will find out about his best friend, and will freak out, he is so in love with her. Johnny's best friend, Mark, is a sexy hunk who would make any woman melt. The impetuous, Lisa, is the woman every woman fears and every man secretly longs to be seduced by. Johnny is the man every woman wishes they had to  completely trust and adore them. Lisa starts to make everyone feel uncomfortable and uneasy  because she has no impulse control. She is out to lure and seduce every man that comes close to her. Some of the scenes showed Lisa, with her huge violet eyes and dark eyebrows, as being very innocent and sweet,  and you actually feel sorry for her. The only person that really seem to be able to touch Lisa, was the young boy that Johnny had adopted. Only with him, did she seem to think about someone besides herself.Look for Mark and Lisa to be Hollywood's next sweethearts. They look just sensational on the big screen together. I don't know where Tommy found a couple that looks so much alike. When they are on the big screen together, they are beautiful.The only problem is Lisa is evil, and Mark is good. But Mark like the other men, is unable to resist Lisa.  The music goes perfectly with the movie. Get the soundtrack. This movie deals with something that is between us and all around us everyday and always will be. This movie was filmed in San Francisco. Something about the movie haunts you  and you end up hungering for more. The movie was very lighthearted, different and entertaining because it took your mind  inside other's lives and their unique friendships. A film we can all relate to.... and fear or.. anticipate.... depending on if you are male or female....and which role you are playing!      Thank you, Tommy-",

This is the plot of \"The Room\". Yet it's over an hour and a half long. Wow.Tommy Wiseau's tour de force is considered by many one of the worst, if not THE worst movie ever made. I agree. Totally. There's just so much wrong on every front. The acting is atrocious. Nobody is even remotely close to be considered an actual actor; Wiseau's line delivery is painful to watch. It's as if he was bored or annoyed by the lines he himself wrote. Speaking of lines, the script. Most of the time it doesn't make sense. The same dialogues are repeated various times during the movie. For example, Lisa and her mother always have the same conversation, with a few minor changes. To say it gets tedious is an understatement. New characters come into the story with no actual purpose and without being properly introduced. It gets confusing, to say the least. Too many love making scenes that are too long and weird, even. In the first 26 minutes, I counted three sex montages. THREE! The music is dull and repetitive. Technically speaking, I honestly can save nothing. So yeah, it's terrible. But because of that, it's hilarious!This movie has become a cult. I've always heard about it and now I can see why. It's so funny that it makes you wonder whether Tommy Wiseau is the biggest troll of all time or this was his serious effort to make a movie. His acting is the worst among one of the worst actor ensemble I've ever seen in a movie. Honestly, he is the main reason for the \"success\" of the picture. There are so many memorable lines, made famous by his delivery and his emotionless face. \"You're tearing me apart, Lisa!\" is one of them. It's just so funny, man! There's so many more elements that make this movie such a cult loved by many. However, I don't want to say too much. I advise you to watch, if you haven't already. Yes, it's awful, one of the worst things I've seen in my life. But it is an experience you will never forget. And I'm still not sure whether that's a good or a bad thing.

I brought this movie to a friend's to show her and she accused me of trying to watch a soft-core porn with her. It was awkward to watch even on my lonesome. I would have to say my favourite scene is the flower shop scene (the transaction between Tommy and the florist is immaculate). To sum it up, this movie is comparable in quality to Birdemic.

However, one day she decides Johnny just isn't doing it well enough for her, so she decides to go seek a new romance, Mark (Greg Sestero) Johnny's best friend. Throughout the movie new subplots are introduced but then immediately dropped and never mentioned again.The acting in this movie is what really makes this movie a classic. Tommy Wiseau is a master at cranking out hilarious one-liners that will keep me laughing for a long time. The other actors have there moments and laughs but none are as funny as Wiseau.Usually with movies like this, the movie starts out funny then dies down to a point where you turn it off to find a more stimulating activity. This does NOT happen with the room, it keeps you engaged with it from start to end. It should be noted that the love scenes are frequent in this movie and do tend to drag out a lot longer then they need to be.On a critical level this movie it terrible and should be excruciating to watch, but it does the opposite. It shows the true meaning of a movie, to entertain.10/10 Highly Recommended to people with a good sense of humour.",

Anybody who wishes to make a movie should watch it thoroughly, so that they can know what to avoid...forever.There is 1 redeeming quality to this movie and that is the quality of the camera work. Let's face it, most independent films possess qualities just slightly better than a VHS set-up, and the cinematography of the Room is top notch. The camera work is smooth, and the audio pick-up is crisp and clean. There are bigger budget movies (Cough * TRANSFORMERS * Cough) that could learn a lesson or 2 about making certain that people can see what's happening on-screen (like any movie that has useless Shaky-Cam).The story is atrocious. The protagonist is creepy (the woman who played his fianc\u00e9e looked to be about 20 years old as well as being 20 years younger than him, and the were supposed to have been dating for 7 years or so). The soundtrack is cheesy. There are about 4 gratuitous sex scenes in the first 30 minutes, so that it feels like you should be watching this in an adult theater* (while angrily demanding a refund of your money).

What do we say in America of those who \"laugh at somebody\"....case in point, enough said...but just shame on you.Those that laugh AT others show their own character and how \"small\" they are. There are many little kids who experience this same meanness as a small child. It shows how inmature and what a low self concept this person has of self.There was something about this movie that appeals to a great many people. Many of the movies I see now days are so the same old movie type, with the same faces....very boring and trite. It is really fun and refreshing to find something out there that is delightfully different with some different actors. Each of these actors were very different and really had their own personalities.This movie was alive with energy and fun spirit. There was something about \"THE ROOM\" that made you feel as if these actors were really your own friends and you felt part of the movie. Some critic had pointed out that some of the movie had been filmed to show this movie took place in San Francisco. So what is new....? That makes it interesting. And to the makers of this movie I say to you....ignore the critics..they are there because otherwise no one would notice them and it is obvious that some of these guy for some reason appears to be very jealous or for some reason is trying to make fun of Tommy Wiseau. Shame on them....it just shows a persons character.The movie was very colorful in the color displayed throughout the film and the characters were colorful in their personalities. The acting was great and alive with new energy. I am not in the movie business....I am just a movie goer that was delighted to find something different from the usual trite movies fed to us by the same group of Hollywood, that wants everyone to think and see things only one way...their way. This movie was funny, entertaining, kept your attention and you loved all the characters... I can understand the cult following completely. Remember Mr.Wiseau, the people who are making the negative comments are the ones in the business who don't like you personally for whatever reason. People like me, are the ones who are not in the business, but actually go to the movie for fun and pure enjoyment. And we.........lots of us loved the movie and would like to see more. Thank you for making it. It was beautiful.",

            "content": "This is easily the worst 'thing' that I've ever sat through. Me and 7 of my friends were having a movie night yesterday and my friend Stephen brought this with him, claiming \"I don't know what this is and apparently no one on the planet does so we should watch it.\" There was me, Stephan, Mason and Shane who are all male and Anna, Katie, Zoe and Gina who are female (I'm saying this just so I can establish and go into more detail about one of our reactions later) and all of us had different reactions to what we were seeing. Me, Mason Anna and Katie were looking on in confusion throughout the whole thing, Stephen and Shane were laughing uncontrollably, Gina was offended and Zoe fell asleep.There was just so much stuff wrong in this thing that I repeatedly asked the question \"why was this made? What possessed Tommy Wiseau to make this? Did he intentionally make this bad? Did he make this to settle debt? Did he actually think he could become a memorable film director?\" I can only answer one of those questions, he became a memorable film director/producer/writer/actor but for the wrong reasons.Where do I start? The acting is some of the worst caught on camera. I was in an amateur theatre production by Queen's hall arts called Minor's Strike and I would like to emphasise, it was an amateur production and all of our acting was praised in the performance and I was 13 at the time. These actors, who are around their 30s/40s are acting worse than we did and we were amateurs and hadn't taken acting school at the time. Tommy Wiseau is easily the worst though. He is the worst actor and this film and what goes well with a bad actor you might ask? Badly written dialogue for this bad actor to spout out.\"We have a new client at the bank we make a lot of money, anyway how is your sex life\" This is an actual piece of dialogue that was delivered by Tommy Wiseau, imagine that an 8 year old French boy is saying this line and you will get Tommy Wiseau's whole performance.There are also these really uncomfortable sex scene moments which is what Gina was offended by. I know that we're in an age where the ESRB raters are awfully sceptical about letting certain age demographics watch certain movies and usually controversy is applauded by audience and that's why Harvester and Hatred got as much attention as they did but this thing in The Room, these sex scenes which is applauded by possibly the horn word (not allowed to say it because of IMDb's rules) teenage boy demographic, these sort of scenes are just plain awkward for people to sit through. Also, there is about 5 of these uncomfortable sex scenes in this film, each lasting about 5 mins. Which means the total amount of time we spent watching some porno was just under 1/3 of the film.There are also these really weird scenes that don't go anywhere. They happen and then that's it.I wish there was a way that I could unsee this film and none of you get this film, even if you're curious, don' get it. I wish to never see Tommy Wiseau in anything again, if he even is in anything else and if he is, there's something wrong with this world.",

While its a mess, its clearly written from some place of truth or experience in Tommy Wiseau's heart. There's something of a biopic going on here, where nice guy Johnny gets manipulated, lied to and taken advantage of by the people close to him.

Nobody (but NOBODY) spends between $7m - $9m of their own money to take the proverbial out of Hollywood. (Pointless tilting at that particular windmill). 3. It's just SO BAD it makes Sharknado look like an Oscar Nominated Classic. 4. It's worse than Knight Rider 2010 - yep, it's that bad.Oh wait, is the irony that Tommy Wiseau doesn't get irony?

He lives in his own world, with his own standards and there, in this world, Tommy Wiseau is king! Not just any king either: He is a good king; he is an admired king. His people worship him and why not? He is good to his people. He treats them respectfully. He gives them all the encouragement and friendship they require. In Wiseau Land, he has been the elected king 687,327,921 and a half times now! And while, yes, his movie is VERY indulgent and self centered, it's charming and oblivious. He really does see himself as this all-American, perfect without fault Johnny character. He wants us to perceive him this way, and I say, we should. Why the heck not? He's not hurting anyone and I think we owe him for all the quotes, memes and laughs he is providing us. Now I will admit that the movie is not for everyone. Heck, it's literally just for Mr. Wiseau---but it's noteworthy, to me, if just for the fact that someone said, \"Ah dun care wha any bahdy say! Ah will make dream movie! People, they use me; they lie to me and I dun care any more---oh, hai Greg!\". Tommy made his dream come true; put his stupid heart on the line and succeeded in his failure! He made a negative, a positive and that's pretty hard to do sometimes! So while it is not a great movie, it's a great example of what someone can do if they really put effort into their selves...",

It wasn't until I was there, fatefully making the mistake to attend sober, that I realized the only way you could sit through more than 5 minutes was to be drunk/stoned/both. I can see how, viewed in a theater at midnight after a few drinks, this might conjure up its own hilariously demented cult following complete will call back lines and spoons but for anyone expecting a movie worth crowds this size, don't go. The writer/producer/director/leading man Tommy Wiseau lacks talent in both his character acting (if you could even call it that) and writing skills. The self-financed \"The Room\"s shortcomings go way beyond the standard array of glaring continuity errors, dodgy sets and stagnant editing...it's hard to describe how bad the acting in the film actually is.

Believe me if you ever get the chance to go to a screening I highly recommend it, you won't regret it.

This film is so bad it's become cult viewing, yet the overall plot will be familiar to most people despite it being a subject rarely covered by mainstream movies. It's like they've filmed the looping neurotic daydream thoughts of a cuckolded man, hence several lines and ideas are repeated and much of it is illogical or doesn't really fit. The script sounds like it was written by an 8 year old - an 8 year old monkey. Tommy Wiseau's acting is as though he is heavily sedated with anti-psychotic drugs, or alternatively, like an android that's failed the Turing Test. The other actors weren't quite as bad, but with their lines and Wiseau's direction it's hard to be sure if they're actual professionals or not. Terrible film with many illogical moments, but somehow still feels more real and relevant than most films. The video and audio quality is mostly ok, and the music actually wasn't too bad, plus there's a few softcore sex scenes - if you think that's a redeeming feature. 3/10.",

            "content": "Most good movies are credited as having a coherent plot, a skillful display of editing, and well-developed characters that the audience can easily relate to. In such films we would feel our pulses racing as the lead character finds himself in a dangerous circumstance, we would cheer as the villain is brought to justice, and we would cry during the death of the very characters that we have grown to love as the movie has progressed. If you were to watch Tommy Wiseau's \"The Room\", you would find that this is most definitely not the case. The writing, directing, editing and acting in this movie is so hilariously unbelievable, is of no depth nor substance, and is about as close to \"real life\" (as Wiseau claims) as a toaster is to passing off as a squirrel. It's just not possible.But herein lies the irony of The Room. If it is so incredibly unbelievable, then why is it loved by audiences everywhere? What separates The Room from other \"bad\" movies such as \"Garbage Pail Kids\", \"Howard the Duck\" or \"Kazaam\"? Why do we (or I, at least) love \"The Room\" so much and not every other awful movie in existence? It is, like the title of this review suggests, a very different kind of awful, and the reason for it, I believe, is the Producer/Director/Writer/Lead Actor himself, Tommy Wiseau.Anything about The Room that is of note should be credited to Wiseau. He did, after all, write, direct, produce and star in the movie. To summarize, the film is about a banker named Johnny and his fianc\u00e9 Lisa, the latter of which is having an affair with Johnny's best friend, Mark, and... well that's about it. The large majority of the film is made up of scenes that either present the same ideas as earlier scenes or serve absolutely no purpose to the plot whatsoever.\"Yes, yes, that's all good, Rumpelkombo, but why do you like the movie so much?\" Well, curious reader, like I mentioned before, I credit all of the brilliantly pathetic qualities of The Room to Wiseau. The reason why The Room is so unique as a bad movie, in my opinion, is because Wiseau himself is so unique. Until \"The Room\" came along, he was completely unknown, and even today not much is known about his past. He claims that he was born and raised in the US, despite having a mysterious European accent, he has not fully disclosed the methods by which he raised the $6 million budget for the movie, but most importantly, he sees The Room like a mother sees her own child; a product of his own self that he believes to be a beautiful and perfect representation of his thoughts and ideas - a tragedy that captures the betrayal and downward spiral of the \"normal\" human being. Imagine the shock he received when audiences burst out into laughter at the film's premiere. While George Lucas chose to sever the ties between himself and \"Howard the Duck\", Wiseau has remained more proud of \"The Room\" than anything else. Wiseau takes himself so seriously that you can't help but laugh, and if I were to point out every single hilariously awful aspect of this movie I'd be here for weeks.I should probably note that, as such, I don't believe the actors or the crew are at all responsible for \"The Room\". The crew only did what they were commanded to do by His Royal Highness and the actors, to their credit, were given very little opportunity to improvise, or to even become familiar with their characters. An article by Robyn Paris, who played \"Michelle\", describes Wiseau's hilariously unprofessional method of casting actors (\"You just won the lottery. Go!\"), how she was given twenty minutes to learn her lines and how the actors weren't even allowed copies of the script because... wait for it... Wiseau was afraid the actors would steal it. No, I'm not joking, search \"How 'The Room' Turned Me Into a Cult Movie 'Star'\" and click the first link. I'll give you a moment to read it if you'd like. I'm not going anywhere.The reasons I didn't give it a 10/10 are trivial, but nonetheless I saw as having a negative impact on the movie's brilliance. Firstly, I had to see Tommy Wiseau's hideously wrinkly rear end. One word: UNNECESSARY! I strongly recommend keeping your hands free for the first ten minutes of the movie in anticipation for this moment. It happens just after Johnny and Lisa have sex. You're welcome. Secondly, *SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER* Johnny dies, meaning that there is little hope for a sequel... unless it involves Johnny's ghost haunting Lisa after she decides to get back together with Mark in which case this movie is, wrinkly buttocks aside, immediately brought up to a 10/10. \"You are tearing me apart Lisaaah! Ooooh!\" In short, Tommy Wiseau is the reason I love \"The Room\". There are so many interesting mysteries surrounding him and so many things wrong with his idea of a \"good movie\" that it is near impossible to not see the ironic brilliance of \"The Room\".",

Seriously, watch it! But not by yourself. Get some of your buddies together, drink a few beers and laugh your @$$ off! I have to give Tommy Wiseau credit. Granted, he made one of the worst movies ever made and he's mentally unstable, but he sure knows how to get it seen!",

With an intent to be a heavy hitting romantic drama and cautionary tale, this film has an effect drastically different as a finished product. Tommy Wiseau created a film so terrible that it has become a laugh-out-loud comedic hit within a large cult following. The production of Wiseau's passion project is widely known as being extremely chaotic and itself a hilarious story, as displayed in James Franco's film The Disaster Artist. Horrible camera quality caused by use of mixing digital and film, terrible use of lighting, atrocious screenplay and performances, and countless horrid sex scenes make this film a Marvel unlike any other. One of the most entertaining comedies I could ever personally name, this disaster is a hilarious viewing experience to unlike any other.",

Good on him and his poor, hard-done-by crew and cast, for their work on this tragic, joyous experience.Honestly, it deserves 1 star, it deserves 10 stars.

            "content": "Oh Hi Mark. You appear to be the expert. Johnny is a successful banker who lives in a San Francisco townhouse with his fianc\u00e9e, Lisa. They share an intense relationship characterised by constant, passionate lovemaking. Despite this idyllic existence, Lisa has inexplicably become dissatisfied with her life, and one afternoon confides to her best friend Michelle and her mother Claudette that she finds Johnny boring. Although Michelle advises her to be grateful for what she has, and her mother counsels her that financial stability is more important than happiness, Lisa decides to seduce Johnny's best friend, Mark. Although he is initially reluctant, Mark gives in to Lisa's advances. Their affair continues through the remainder of the film, even though Mark appears reluctant at the outset of each sexual encounter and repeatedly tries to break off the relationship. Lisa, meanwhile, having come to the realisation that she \"wants it all\", decides to stay with Johnny for financial support and the material goods he can provide her. As the wedding date approaches and Johnny's clout at his bank slips, Lisa alternates between glorifying and vilifying Johnny to her family and friends, both making false accusations of domestic abuse and defending Johnny against criticisms. Meanwhile, Johnny, having overheard Lisa confess her infidelity to her mother, attach\u00e9s a tape recorder to their phone in an attempt to identify her lover. Against the backdrop of Lisa and Mark's affair, numerous subplots involving secondary characters begin to develop: Denny, a neighbouring college student whom Johnny financially supports and \"loves like a son\", has a mysterious run-in with a drug dealer named Chris-R, whom Johnny and Mark overpower and take to the police. Denny also lusts after Lisa, ultimately confessing to Johnny his attraction; once Johnny tells Denny that Lisa loves him as her friend, Denny resolves to propose to his own girlfriend. Johnny takes on a mysterious client at his bank whose identity he is sworn to protect. Claudette experiences real estate problems, bemoans failed relationships, and informs Lisa that she has breast cancer. Michelle and her boyfriend, Mike (Mike Holmes), sneak into Johnny and Lisa's home to have sex. Peter (Kyle Vogt), a psychologist friend of Johnny's and Mark's, alternates between defending Lisa and assessing her as a sociopath, which results in Mark briefly trying to murder him. Each of these subplots receives little exposition, and none is ever resolved. At a surprise birthday party for Johnny to which all of his friends were invited, Steven, a previously unseen friend of Lisa's and Johnny's, catches Lisa kissing Mark while the rest of the guests are outside and confronts her about the affair. Lisa expresses no remorse, while Mark angrily urges Steven not to tell anyone. Johnny announces to the guests that Lisa is pregnant, only for Lisa to tell Steven and Michelle that she lied about it in order to \"make it interesting\". At the end of the evening, Lisa flaunts her affair in front of Johnny, who physically attacks Mark. After the party, Johnny locks himself in the bathroom, prompting Lisa to make plans to leave him for Mark. Johnny finally comes out of the bathroom and retrieves the cassette recorder he attached to the phone, and listens to an intimate call between Lisa and Mark. Claiming that all of his friends have betrayed him, Johnny destroys his apartment and then kills himself with a pistol. Denny, Mark and Lisa discover Johnny's body sometime later. Mark and Denny blame Lisa for Johnny's death, with Mark declaring he does not love Lisa and never wants to see her again. Denny asks Lisa and Mark to leave, but they stay and comfort one another as the sound of sirens grows louder. I fed up of this world! Hi doggy,what do you need money for? I did not hit her, this is rubbish, I did not hit her, I did nooot. This movie is good, and if you don't agree, then you just very bad, you not good, you, you just a chicken; Cheep cheep cheep cheep cheeeep. You're tearing me apart, Lisa! Do you want to stay alive? This ends now. So how is your s*x life?",

            "content": "I have seen this movie twice, and it grows on you. The characters are endearing are you get caught up in their affection for one another and their togetherness. It is something that many men can identify  with from their past or have to look forward to in their future. Some men will keep this as their secret. It clearly shows the timeless triangle of the friendship between two men brought down and completely destroyed by a beautiful, remorseless and deceitful woman using sex and co-dependency as her lethal weapons. The character, Johnny, is so endearing in his complete  trust of his finance,the beautiful Lisa. Johnny is a very sweet and trusting man .The director really missed many  heart stopping moments  that were lost, because of rushing through the scenes that were very loaded with tension and should have been played out to the max. There should have been longer heart stopping pauses, but instead the moment was lost by rushing through the scenes that were exploding with  sexual tension. There were several of these such instances at Johnny's surprise birthday party when everyone was all around having a good time laughing and not knowing how volatile the situation in the room was. The movie really missed it by not exploiting this to the fullest. This was what the whole movie had been building up to. There was so much sexual tension between the unfaithful Lisa and Johnnie's cheating friend, Mark. The air was riveting and charged with the buildup from the start of  the whole movie. The directors should have really made a big deal of long, tension filled, up close eye contact, between Lisa and Mark. Mark was definitely not thinking with his brain. These looks and tensions could have been played out  and underscored so much more.I was disappointed this huge opportunity was barely tapped. This was my biggest disappointment about the entire movie. There should have been more exchange tension filled looks between Lisa and Mark, Mark and Johnnie, and others that knew, but mostly between Lisa and Mark, and the camera should have let time stand still with a close up of the emotion in Lisa and Mark's eyes. Everyone would squirm as the whole party of friends stood in the circle awaiting..... the bomb to explode.....how..... and with whom????? Let the tension exist and prolong it so we all get our money's worth for the.... climax. Lisa was completely  spontaneous, unpredictable and with no inhibitions to get what she wanted..... wherever she wanted it. Even Lisa's mother could not believe how remorseless her daughter was. This movie gets better each time you see it.  All the characters are so endearing you feel like you are actually there with them and they are your friends. Each character is special. There are heart stopping moments of suspense when you think Johnny will find out about his best friend, and will freak out, he is so in love with her. Johnny's best friend, Mark, is a sexy hunk who would make any woman melt. The impetuous, Lisa, is the woman every woman fears and every man secretly longs to be seduced by. Johnny is the man every woman wishes they had to  completely trust and adore them. Lisa starts to make everyone feel uncomfortable and uneasy  because she has no impulse control. She is out to lure and seduce every man that comes close to her. Some of the scenes showed Lisa, with her huge violet eyes and dark eyebrows, as being very innocent and sweet,  and you actually feel sorry for her. The only person that really seem to be able to touch Lisa, was Denny,  the young boy that Johnny had adopted. Only with him, did she seem to think about someone besides herself. Look for Mark and Lisa to be Hollywood's next sweethearts. They look just sensational on the big screen together. I don't know where Tommy found a couple that looks so much alike. When they are on the big screen together, they are beautiful.The only problem is Lisa is evil, and Mark is good. But Mark like the other men, is unable to resist Lisa.  The music goes perfectly with the movie. Get the soundtrack. This movie deals with something that is between us and all around us everyday and always will be. This movie was filmed in San Francisco. Something about the movie haunts you  and you end up hungering for more. The movie was very lighthearted, different and entertaining because it took your mind  inside other's lives and their unique friendships. A film we can all relate to.... and fear or.. anticipate.... depending on if you are male or female....thank you Tommy.-Alice Techner",

The Metacritic score pretty much sums it all up: 9 out of 100, which establishes The Room as one of the lowest scored movies ever, and I have to agree with critics this time around. Is this movie any fun? A few chuckles admittedly, primarily from the leading actor/director/writer Tommy Wiseau's monotone acting/delivery, plus that gif-worthy line \"You're tearing me apart Lisa!\" Nevertheless, these moments are too inadequate to make up for long sequences of mind-numbing dialogues and confounding interactions galore in this movie.

The American Public is so brainwashed by Hollywood that they are afraid when a movie as daring and original as \"The Room\" comes along.Audiences are so used to being spoonfed romantic comedies and clich\u00e9 love stories that they cannot handle Tommy Wiseau telling it like it is.I'm sure a lot of us have had a \"Lisa\" in our lives. A woman that is both evil and seductive. I recently came from a relationship where I was betrayed much like \"Johnny\" in the film and I can say the anguish and pain is captured perfectly in \"The Room\" People who make fun of the\"Lisa you are tearing me a part\" line have obviously never had a love lost. I remember I cried the same way as \"Johnny\" when it happened to me. And to all you macho guys who think that its unmanly when a guy (like Johnny or me) cries because of heartbreak you are full of it. I was captain of my Highschool Football Team and have been with many girls.Speaking of Highschool, I used to date this girl a few times in 10th grade. When I went to college i found out my best friend was seeing her so I know what the relationship between \"Johnny\" and \"Mark\" is like. The strange thing is her name was \"Elizabeth\" and sometimes people called her Lisa when they first met her.The Last thing I want to say is about the symbolism in the movie. It makes me laugh when people get caught up in why \"Johnny\" wears a tuxedo while playing football. Again people have been dumbed down by seeing too many Hollywood Films.People don't understand symbolism anymore. Do you really think \"Johnny\" is wearing a tuxedo because its comfortable? Its a metaphor for the way he feels. The suit represents his approaching marriage and how he lets his friends know that he will not let the confines of that institution prevent him from being just one of the guys. I will let you come up with your own conclusions why it is the psychiatrist that \"falls\".The suit is just one of the many examples of rich symbolism in the movie. The Red Dress symbolizes passion and desire for example.The only reason I'm not giving the movie a perfect 10 is because of the Chris R Scene where Denny is confronted on the roof top about his drug problem. For me it was too intense to be added to the film and i had to leave the theatre for a minute after watching it. It brought up too many painful memories that i wont bring up here.In closing, see the room with an open mind. Let your guard down and abandon what other films have told you your whole life.And remember we all feel trapped and betrayed in our lives but \"There is a door that leads out of every Room\" John N Crawford",

Is Tommy Wisseau, the star, producer, director and egocentric narcissist behind this creation, an idiot savant trolling us all, or merely a halfwit dunce who can't distinguish the difference between creating a film, and the malodorous odour that vacates his anus? Technically-speaking, this 'film' is brimming with ignominious blemishes, from nonsensical editing to a complete absence of any sort of character development. The generic plot involving a woman cheating on her partner with another man is just yet another stain on this technically-dreadful piece of film making. Yet what draws the countless numbers of cult followers, the numerous screenings worldwide and extravagant publicity surrounding The Room? Is it the captivating and perplexing appeal of the outlandish and elusive Tommy Wisseau, whose origins lay unknown to this very day? Are the fans simply entertained by how implicitly bad the film is? The reason The Room may quite possibly be the worst best film ever created, is because every single aspect of the film, subtle or not, is characterised by the poorest of film-making standards, from the movements of the characters to the situation and setting of the scenes. Mr Wisseau could not have deliberately created a film this mind numbingly awful, as that would have been near impossible. Go see this, you won't regret it.",

Really, if Orson Welles were alive today, he would wholeheartedly agree that the Room is infinitely better than Citizen Kane. Tommy Wiseau's acting brings back fond memories of the likes of Marlon Brando, Robert De Niro, and Al Pacino. Every motion and word is said with such realism and emotional power that it is occasionally hard to take it all in. The wonderful supporting cast also lend sparks of brilliance. The writing is phenomenal, and brings to mind such classics at the Coen Brothers' masterpiece Fargo and Charlie Kaufman's Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. There are a number of fascinating subplots in this movie, but they are all woven together with a narrative depth similar to PT Anderson's Magnolia. And finally, there is the cinematography. As evidenced in the frequent shots of San Francisco that appear throughout the film like chocolate chips in a cookie, the camera-work of The Room is something to be marveled at. Really, what more can you ask for in a film? The Room is an emotionally charged, evocative film. Thanks Tommy Wiseau for this wonderful gift to humanity.",

It is not that, it is so bad, that you have to gather around groups of your friends just to get all the different senses of how awful this movie is from each individual observer. And, it is not because this movie makes you want to see it over and over again just to really let it sink in, that you just may have seen the worst movie ever made.This movie is worse than the worse movie ever made. It is worse than that. Which is why it is so astonishing that it actually was made. This movie should not have happened. It should have fallen apart on the first or second day filming, when every actor should have realized that this movie will be a train-wreck. And that's the fascinating thing! They either didn't realize it (scary) or did realize it and just kept right on going (insanely comical).The beauty of this Tommy Wiseau masterpiece is that it lacks every quality of a masterpiece. There are so many clich\u00e9s that the term clich\u00e9 loses all meaning. Wiseau has done away with them. The acting is so terrible that it arguably breaks the forth wall, the actors come out into the audience, and attempt to continue acting anyway. Remarkable! There are no redeeming qualities of this film except one: the fact that it was made--that virtually everyone went through with it. That it made it to the big screen. It is a work of human triumph...not in the story, but in the making. This piece is a result of the triumph of Wiseau and all of his characters working together to put forth something they could call their own.It's like a human-porcupine baby that still suckled from his mother's teat, was cared for, was carried through thick and thin. And you just look at it, all grown up, and think, Damn, how did they not kill that baby--accidentally or otherwise? \"ANYBODY CAN DO IT--YOU JUST HAVE TO PUT YOUR MIND TO IT.\"People always used to tell me that. I always thought, those people were different. Well, Tommy Wiseau is certainly different, but that saying has become a whole lot more inspiring to me.Well done, Mr. Wiseau. Well done on a job horribly, horribly done.(I gave it a 10/10, but not for the movie. If the movie existed in a vacuum, I guess you could still call it a movie and allow it to be rated...a .000001 perhaps. But for the sheer dedication that was put forth to see that this movie, did indeed, succeed in being made.)",

Unintentionally that is, but still. I can see the machination behind what Tommy wanted the story and characters to be but failed miserably thanks to his own innexperience. Even with that, I can see a very honest attempt here. Since it was written with very little exposition and the development itself of the characters is done through actual \"showing not telling\"... for the most part. It was not done right, but it was attempted nonetheless.This movie is about Johnny, a good man with a bright future. His growing frustration with the turning of events in his life and loved ones whom are unnapreciative of Johnny and abuse or waste his goodwill for their own detriment. Lisa, his future wife cheating on him with his best friend, making false claims of his behaviour and taking advantage of his resources. Mark, his best friend lying to him, sleeping with his Lisa, not being capable of controling his impulses and hipocritically smiling to Johnny on his worst moment. Denny, his almost adopted son falling into drugs and debt even though he counts on the inconditional and selfless help of Johnny.These are some of the events that weight into the frustration carried by Johnny through and to the bitter end.All this development we get only in glimpses since it is not really well executed or performed on any level by anyone. Were this movie any better at any aspect of filmaking, would it be remembered today?The reputation this movie has gotten for itself is legendary. Special screenings of it are held and packed full of people willing to overact their reactions to the point of being ape-like. Acting as if every take, every line, every transition, every frame was the most hilarious moment ever put on screen. A movie with A-tier actors was made to glorify an aspect of the movie that is not really there. Completely mis-understanding the movie and making mindless fun of mis-represented events. This, I now perceive, as an almost act of humilliation directed towards a crew that at least attempted to get a movie made and succeded. Not in the intended way though. This reputation has led it's crew and Tommy himself to act as if the innexperienced nature of it's making was not only intentional, but calculated and planned. Smiling along.I can say that, yes, this is a bad movie. But not really funny or nearly as bad as THE WORST or SO BAD IT'S GOOD movie I have seen.",

I had heard stories before of this film, but I had to see it myself to be sure. Watching it, I realised it was true. Never before had I seen such a film with so many extraordinary one-liners that my friends and I can still remember with accuracy to this day. The plot was definitely intriguing, and one that I struggled to figure out right until the very end.Moving onto the plot, which is complex yet enjoyable, it involves the struggles of Johnny, the lovable rogue who attempts to enchant his would-be lover Lisa with his charm and wit. However, this fails, as Lisa falls for a young man by the name of Mark, who has troubles overcoming his drug addiction which constantly pains him. Meanwhile, a young boy by the name of Denny tries to cope with the city environment in which he lives, eventually getting into trouble with a drug dealer. Johnny saves him, however, and the two appear to become the best of friends. Eventually, Lisa hints to Johnny that she is in love with Mark, and does not love Johnny any more, but our protagonist fails to take the hint, and everything slowly disintegrates from there on out in the film. Once even consulting the psychiatrist fails, everyone slowly seems to descend into madness struggling to cope with the pressure of everyday life. Eventually, Johnny shoots himself due to the stress and anguish he faces, and is mourned by Denny.The film's greatness is ensured by the amount of skill Tommy Wiseau has as an actor, portraying Johnny. His delivery of one particular line where he shouts in despair at Lisa, who is apparently \"tearing him apart\", can be considered (and is considered by many) one of the greatest moments in film in recent years. All in all, I am giving this film a 3. You may be wondering why, due to the apparent positivity in this review, and the fact that I gave it an 8. It happens that all of the positivity was non-existent, you were just interpreting it incorrectly.As a film, The Room is honestly terrible, but as a way to waste an hour and forty minutes, it's one of the best I can imagine.-chimaru98",

You have likely heard that this film is the worst ever made, it's so bad it's good, or some over dramatized rant about how awful it is to sit through. I'm going to tell you right now the God's honest truth about this movie: It sucks.But it's a very complicated kind of suck, the kind only a vacuum could speak of. It is horribly inept in technical execution, it's dialogue sounds like it came out of a melting calculator , and the actors, Wiseau in particular, act with the grace of card board cut outs of actors in a middle school production of \"Macbeth\". Its score is horrendous to listen to and the cinematography is hardly enviable.And despite all of it, I love this movie. Wiseau is in many ways like a young child trying to impress his parents, trying to do everything a good movie entails but failing miserably at it every step of the way. It's like watching a forest fire. It's just hard not to be enticed by the flames of this disaster, to keep your eyes fixed as you watch the hapless Johnny drift from scene to scene with his array of accents and obscure lines. It's not that it's so bad it's good, it's just so bad you reach the bliss of realizing that you are bearing witness to something truly spectacular, the worst honest attempt at cinema ever concocted. Lucifer himself could not create a movie so terrible, let alone as funny. Its charm, much like that of the aforementioned child is simply too much to ignore, you can't help but feel sympathy for Wiseau and his effort to become a star of cinema.This is not a movie one should watch alone. Have a few friends with a good sense of humor join you as I did, and have fun tearing apart every little detail in this train wreck. By the end of the two hours your gut will be sore from laughter, your head awash with jokes, and pretty soon you'll start every greeting with \"Oh hi Mark!\" This film will change your life for the better, it's hopeless existence giving meaning to yours.

            "content": "The Room is a 99 minute \"drama\" film entirely created by bizarre director Tommy Wiseau, an American, French accented, person who fails completely at making any valid point whatsoever on his interviews, comments, dialogs, or the movie itself. Asumming that he is in fact American, you can pretty much judge from first appearances that Wiseau is one of the worst English speakers ever. He doesn't understand the basic concepts of spelling and syntaxes, making him appear like a retarded grown man, or a confused teenager trapped in Ozzy Osbourne's body.Apart from that, reviewing this movie is almost unnecessarily, because there's nothing to debate, there's nothing in this film to be criticized or explained. Anyone with 1% of movie culture can predict from the first 2 minutes that this is one of the poorest intentions of making a decent film. The cast, the crew, the editing, the music, the direction, the landscaping... it's just ridiculous. It doesn't make any sense at all, and that's why it's a funny and distracting film. Because every character or line on the film borders stupidity and non-sense. The hole concept of dramatic relationships and social problems becomes an artificial plot that fails epically at displaying any kind of emotion. Veredict: 30% - WATCH ONLINE The Room serves as a perfect Clase-B comedy for weekends. Watch it with your friends, or your couple. You'll laugh your a** off many times.",

That's an experience that cannot be replaced. It's not quite possible to fully articulate my feelings towards this film, aside from \"hilarity.\" But that doesn't do it justice.

The pacing varies from decent to atrocious yet it has a weird charm to it that keeps you engaged for the majority of the movie. I say majority because the only flaw that this movie has is it's length. It's too long, waaaaaay to long. The last 30 to 40 minutes are a drag to sit trough and you just want it to end. They could've easily done that too since there are a lot of scenes that repeat themselves or are completely pointless.Overall i'd say it's worth checking out if you're in for some dumb entertainment that you can watch either alone or share this wonderful experience with a friend or two.",

This film was evidently written for the pure purpose of Tommy being able to get his end away with a young adult. Nobody wants to see his wrinkly chest.

Johnny (writer/director Tommy Wiseau) has everything a man could ever want: great friends, a good job, and a gorgeous fianc\u00e9e named Lisa (Juliette Danielle). But Lisa's innocent act masks the fact that she's looking to bring Johnny down, and her manipulations are tearing Johnny apart. As Lisa informs her cancer- ridden mother, Claudette (Carolyn Minnott), that Johnny hit her (he did not hit her, that is bull$&*t, he did not), Johnny's best friend, Mark (Greg Sestero), finds his resistance to Lisa's seductive charms weakening. Meanwhile, local orphan Denny (Philip Haldiman) looks up to Johnny, and needs the older man's help after the teen rips off a drug dealer. What kind of drugs? It doesn't matter. Then guys play football in tuxedos, because you can play football anywhere. Upon release in Los Angeles, The Room began attracting a small crowd of devoted cult followers who hailed it as the next Rocky Horror Picture Show, talking back to the screen and acting out scenes as the softcore, melodramatic train wreck of a film derails up on the big screen. In time, word of The Room's hopelessly incompetent, unintentionally hilarious charms began to spread, and screenings started to to crop up from coast to coast. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi",

See The Room, see it with a group of people, bring a Nerf football, and, for the love of all that is right in the world, don't expect to see a movie in the traditional sense. Engineers have the phrase \"design only reveals itself when it fails\" and The Room is an incredible study in all the things that we don't usually think about that goes into a normal movie.

How can this man go the entire movie without moving one muscle in his face besides his mouth. On top of his physical attributes, Johnny may be the worst dressed human being in the universe. The film is as if an alien read \"American Culture for Dummies,\" wrote a script overnight, translated the script from Native Alien Language to English, and then neglected to have anyone look over and proofread the script. Every line in the film is a mixture of a cliche and nonsense. \"I would like a large pizza half canadian bacon, half pineapple pesto, light on the cheese\" WTF kind of pizza is that. \"Honey would you like pizza?\" \"Ehh not really, whatever\" \"Great, cus I ordered Pizza :)\" WhyTF you smiling when he said he didn't care for the pizza???.... *Pizza mysteriously shows up on table within 1 minute and its a SMALL CHEESE ONLY PIZZA no toppings in sight.How to write this script:\n1. Buy a book full of cliches\n2. Cut out every cliche in the book and put all the pieces of paper in a hat\n3. Blindly pick the cliches out of the hat one by one, and put them all in a row\n4. Go through every cliche and switch 2 random words in that cliche to words that don't make sense\n5. Congratulations you just wrote The RoomBTW WhyTF is this move called \"the room\" that has absolutely NO significance AT ALL. My guess is that the entire film was shot in one room that's how bad the sets are...",

The scenery of San Francisco gives us a beautiful ambience which flows together with the music. The words spoken by Johnny, \"You are tearing me apart, Lisa!\" will go down in history. Lisa's mother Claudette gives us a sence fo bad parenting; however quite realistic. Mark, Johnny's best friend gives us a James Dean style. The entire movie is well made and I would recommend that you see it.",

My friend and I had a good laugh watching this, we cringed so much that it became hilarious.

While I was searching for new apps. on my cell phone I came upon the ugly mug of Tommy Wiseau and his deep intense stare....similar to that of man who's been hit over the head with a frying pan. From there I had to download the sound board and instantly I was hooked. I had to get this movie no matter what the cost...and like the speed of Wiseau's painful laugh I had the movie in my hands a week later. This epic adventure takes place in San Francisco, I believe, with a background soundtrack that spins the hits from those classic 90's cine max after dark flicks. Wiseau's screen presence is similar to that of Patrick on SpongeBob SquarePants, comical and ridiculous. I'm not sure where to begin because I'm not sure if this is meant to be a serious script or one of utter illusion and embarrassment. It's random scenes and even more ridiculous classic \"lines\" are so out there that you can't turn it off nor do you want to recommend it to anyone because you're afraid people will think you ate crayons as a child.....a lot of crayons. I think it can be summed up like this, The Room is a movie that you will watch to laugh, watch to cry, and watch to completely make yourself feel better that you were born on earth and you don't get fed crazy pills everyday.",

            "content": "Going to see \"The Room\" on a Saturday night is simply one of the best times you can have in the Los Angeles area. From the moment Tommy Wisseau comes out to interact with the audience and lasts late into the night, long after the movie is finished when you and your friends talk about what a great time you had and plan on how you will get other friends to come see it with you next time.I have actually seen this movie several times and I can honestly say that there is much more to this film than one can absorb in only one or two screenings. It takes at least three screenings before you even begin to see past the carnival atmosphere of the audience and the comedic dialogue (both in the movie and in the audience).Behind this seemingly absurd presentation is actually a powerful message. It is a tale that all of us have either experienced ourselves or will most likely experience some time in our life. It is a story of love, lies, friendship and betrayal. Within this story lies not only great words of wisdom, but also a grim warning of which road not to take.I would also like to take a moment to address some comments I have heard about Tommy Wisseau himself. First, I would like to point out that personal attacks on him have nothing to do with reviewing his movie. Second I would like to note that all of these attacks (he is pompous, arrogant, etc.) are patently false.I think many people see Tommy during his interaction with the audience and can not understand the feelings they have. Rather than examine these feelings they simply decide that he is \"pompous\" or \"arrogant\" because they feel he is unapproachable. It makes sense. Here is a man who has everything many would dream of in Hollywood. He has made a popular movie with a huge following and has legions of adoring fans who come to see his movie again and again. His film continues to pack the theater long after it's inital release and has outlived \"the next big thing\" time and again. Blockbuster after blockbuster has come and gone, but The Room stays... I challenge you to find a theater where you can see \"Batman Begins\".. once you have failed in that, come and see The Room.In light of all this I think people feel inferior to Tommy. He has everything they cannot. I urge you all to get past this and see that he is not at all superior. Nor does he think he is better than any of you... that is all in your imagination. Like his character \"Johnny\", Tommy is just like all of us. He is actually very approachable and a wonderful guy.If he seems irritated or short tempered, remember that he has a life just like you. He exists outside of that theater on Saturday nights. He has trials and tribulations like us all. Screening The Room for us all to enjoy is hard work. He's just tired and had a hard day, but he loves you all.I hope I will see you at the movie. (I'm the big guy with the green bi-hawks in the front row, say hai! <3! Mike!)",

You would most likely rate this movie is three out of 10 (and it automatically gets two stars just because of the fact that it actually is a real existing movie, almost like the SATs, where you get 500 points just for writing your name correctly).But the brilliance about this movie is that it even fails on that level. At a critical point in the movie, one of the characters dramatically The protagonist by his actual real name and not by his character name. I'm sure this is commonplace in many low-budget bad movies, but after reading about the production of the film, and how they had to do 50 takes for the Simplest dialogue driven scenes (oh hai mark), this piece of information is absolutely hilarious and mind-boggling, and is a true testament to the amazingly awesome awfulness that is this film, and the seeing this film is the only way to fully appreciate and understand what I mean. Another testament to how bad and at the same time amazing this film is is the sheer fact that I am , a casual moviegoer who rarely posts on IMDb, is taking all of this time to articulate my thoughts on it as if it was a college literature paper. You can tell just by watching it that Johnny wisseau really Poured his heart and soul this movie, and, more disturbingly, his true to life emotional and personal problems. I never thought I would say this but this brings a different level of poignancy to the film. Since it has been released, \"the room\" has become a massive cult classic (deservedly so ) to the point where James Franco is making a movie about the making of it. Many, including myself, feel that this cheapens the amazing one-of-a-kind spectacle that the movie is; but at the same time it really drives home and gives legitimacy to this unintentional modern cult classic and how far-reaching this movie is. This is one of those films where you make your friends watch 10 minutes of it. At first they are confused and angry and want to watch something else. But after 10 minutes they can't keep their eyes off of it and are captivated by all it's glory. Johnny Wisseau's acting and directing are what it look like if an alien came from Mars, took over a humans body, and tried their awkward and damned hardest to act and fit in like a normal human being.There is not enough to be said about this film and if you've taken the time to read this diatribe that you are obviously already intrigued. In closing, \"the room\" may be rated a three on IMDb, but in the Echleon of horrible movies that are so that are so bad that they're amazing, it is \"the Godfather part two\".",

That is a small analogy of what this film made me want to do: I wanted to be incoherent like it. I was inspired by the inept acting, the gorgeous utilisation of continuity errors, and the reflection of the ceiling fan in Johnny's buttocks. They looked like a pair of trophies, passionately polished with a buffing machine. The cast wanted me to smear Vaseline on the television as a token of my gratitude towards the un-clumsy variety of age differences, defeating the awkwardness of social interaction between the characters. I would never have thought an 18 rated film could have felt as if I was watching a Universal - suitable for all ages. Oh Tommy, this could have never happened without you.On a serious note don't watch expecting some soppy romance. Expect a train-wreck of bromance, sex accompanied with blatant porn music and overly-hyperbolic grunting and American football in tuxedos. And really, really bad acting.

If you're a fan of terrible low-budget cinema, this movie is an experience that should not be missed! Hats off to Mr. Wiseau for making this gem.",

            "content": "Having achieved infamy as being one of, if not the, worst film of all time it was about time I settled down to watch this and see for myself.The answer? It most certainly is up there.The dialogue is perhaps the most ridiculous, nonsensical ever committed to film. In some places it just doesn't even match with what is happening on screen leaving you completely bewildered but in a state of amusement for sure. The infamous \"I did not\" scene will have you both roaring with laughter and shaking your head at the ludicrous nature of it all.This film is full of bizarre & random scenes such as playing football (American) in a tuxedo, excruciating long and unrealistic sex scenes, absurd conversations with friends, nonchalantly discussing illness and that hideous out of place laugh that made me fell nervous and uncomfortable every time it sounded.The acting is in the premiership of dreadfulness. I cannot believe that these people were paid for doing such an awful job \u2013 there is certainly hope for us all yet. Nothing is said with any passion or commitment to the project. Everything is said matter-of-factly straight from the script pages.So is this film \"so bad it's good\" or \"so bad it's hated\"? Truth be told it's neither and is that rarity of just being plain bad. It is however definitely worth seeing to delight in its absurdity.I'm not an expert in film or cinematic techniques (as you can undoubtedly tell from this review) but just a guy who watches a lot of films. Whilst it is true that this is an awful film in its acting, writing, production and direction, it is incredibly difficult to be too harsh for one reason; Tommy Wiseau. Here we have a man, who despite not being the most talented has achieved something most of us never will \u2013 by making this film he has followed his dream and there is something heart achingly beautiful in that most illusive of human endeavours.",

The story, the writing, the direction, the acting, the set design, the 'special effects', all combine to form a perfect storm of suck.

I have seen the movie several times before and I have seen reviews of the film as well and the best way to watch this movie is as a comedy. Heat up some popcorn, invite some friends over, buy the DVD, then watch it on your TV and have some laughs. To put it loosely, this film is a comedy of errors. The plot is bland, the characters are worse, and it is also very easy to tell that it was dubbed over. So what? It's a funny movie. It's fun watching all of the mistakes unfold into the train accident entitled \"The Room\". There are a lot of problems to be seen and they are very big problems and holes in the movie, but you can't help but watch and laugh.

The sex scenes were very well done and each one had a brilliantly composed soundtrack, although i will warn you there is a few of them so please keep children out of \"the room\". Tommy Wiseaus acting is misunderstood by many but if anyone can remember the acting troupes that used to show up to your elementary school to perform small skits about the dangers of doing drugs or smoking cigarettes; than you can understand the true merit of acting classes at universities such as Laney Community College in Oakland.

Tommy's bizarre manner of speech, his erratic acting, and his Frankenstein-esque, hobo-esque appearance is so dumbfounding. By no means should he have made a film, but he did. He freaking did because he wanted to. The passion Tommy has is so strong it must have blinded himself of the movie horribleness, thus creating a blindfold of us in the movie. I loved the movie because it was a fantastic laugh and do not be surprised this movie is hilarious. But I believe the real reason its so funny is because Tommy put in his heart and soul into a movie he had no idea how to make so tried so hard to make something so good on an artistic, dramatic level but his incompetence made the movie into what it is, what its better being- a literal comedy of errors.",

It was not realistic, and was not committed to being absurd or surreal either. The acting was some of the worst I have seen in my life. The sex scenes were unnecessary and even comedic, drawn out, and my God, reusing footage (some called that symbolism for the love being repetitive, but I just call it lazy filmmaking. There were other ways to show that). Random 'plot points' are brought up, and never mentioned again (like 'We're expecting!'), and the sets were so amature (a dude fell at one point and the walls shook mad, there were green outlines on actors from the green screens... just make it stop). Overall, the film was a joke. It was an art house flop. Only watch it if you are at a midnight cinema, and can throw spoons and footballs at the screen. My local theatre plays it once a month so people can get drunk and yell lines at the screen. It is hilarious because it is so terrible.",

Tommy Wiseau is by far the most uncomfortable thing to watch on a TV. I say thing because I don't know what Tommy Wiseau is. His facial features are so oddly prominent. His voice sounds similar to dragging your finger nails down a chalk board. He's a polish American; only he was born in America. So I'm not exactly sure why he has such poor English speaking skills. Tommy wrote, directed, produced, and acted in this movie. His acting is so terribly atrocious. He and his cast of characters acted out their parts in such a mundane, uninspired, and cringe worthy manner. The plot is so simple. Tommy's fianc\u00e9 Lisa cheats on him with his best friend mark. She then lies by saying Tommy hit her in a drunken rage. Tommy then proves his innocence but ends up committing suicide by the end of the film because he believed he was that hated and disliked. Sounds like a pretty simple plot right? WRONG! He some how turned a simple concept into a complex, horrible mess of brainless character development, awful dialogue, and a plot that literally goes in circles for about an hour and a half. This isn't a movie that is so bad that its good. This is just bad. A lot of people say that this movie was intended to be funny. Well that's a bunch of crap. This movie was intended to be a serious romantic drama about a guy who tried to fix the marriage that never was. The most serious moments end up falling flat and they eventually become hilarious for all the wrong reasons. Tommy says \"Oh Hi!\" about 100 times through out the whole movie. Its so f***ing annoying. The first line of the movie after the title screen ends is Tommy saying \"Oh Hi babe!\". That is literally how the movie starts. The characters talk in circles. And don't even get me started about the sex scenes. There's like 7 or 8 sex scenes. The actress that played Lisa was so uncomfortable during the first sex scene that they had to take unused scenes from the first sex scene and put it into the second scene. She was literally that uncomfortable that they had to re-use parts from the first sex scene, because she didn't want to film another sex scene. The rooftop scenes are undoubtedly the best in the movie. The green screen of the city background was done so terribly. Its obvious that there's a green screen in the back ground. Tommy Wiseau even had the audacity to nominate The Room for an Oscar! He thought it was that good! This movie absolutely blows my mind. The only way you can enjoy this film is if you are high, drunk as f*ck, or slightly mental. This movie is atrocious in a variety of ways. Watch at your own risk. If you receive brain damage as a result of watching this, don't blame me because I warned you. This movie changed my life and not in a good way. Honestly this is a terrible movie period. I wish Tommy Wiseau would have gotten the hint and stopped making movies then and there. But this isn't his only travesty of a film, but that's another review for another time.",

The scene in which Johnny kills himself is so well acted, you, the viewer feel like you are stuck in his situation. The set design is so greatly put together I think they should've gotten an award. Every part of this movie is interesting. Tommy Wiseau should be marked as one of the best directors in our history. This deserves a strong 9.\nThe only problem I had with the review is that it was a lie.",

            "content": "I have just recently started rating movies left and right on my IMDb account. I was actually surprised considering I'm not the hugest of film buffs (even though I'd like to be) at how many films I actually remember watching. In order to mark each film I'd give a rating, some films I remember vividly, some not, I'd just give some thought of how much an impression a film made on me and I'd give it the related score. Sooner or later I made it to \"The Room\". Yes I know, objectively, this movie has miraculously missed the mark in possibly every subcategory you could rate a film by. I'd say that the camera-work Isn't that bad in comparison to other horrible movies, but considering the budget this film had they could probably have afforded a decent crew. Besides that though, the script, the acting, the sets, the soundtrack...all these things are so bad in the most unique of ways. You ask yourself how is this even possible?If your a fan of the Room you know the back story, you've read the book, you've watched the interviews, and most of you are simply fascinated, just like me. The Room is Actor/Director/Producer Tommy Wiseau's brain child. Tommy is well... an eccentric man with a mysterious past. This film heavily bares his stamp of approval at each and every stage of production. When you delve just a little beneath the superficial layer you realize you are actually viewing one of the most deeply personal movies ever made. You notice that all these other actors, they are just forcing themselves to deliver these ridiculous lines that Tommy wrote and it just seems strange. Every character is actually Tommy interacting with Tommy.More skilled writers and directors are able to be empathetic and create dynamic characters that are believably distant from their own ideals and personality. Tommy is not one of those men. He cannot speak in metaphors, he cannot be subtle. He poured out his heart in this movie... the script and he's tried to disguise it as best he could.It's kind of tragic considering the whole world is laughing at him now. Personally I believe a good movie is one that leaves a lasting impression. This movie definitely has, probably more than any other other film I've watched. You are left fascinated by this persona and his unique personality. Watching this movie for the first time will be hard to comprehend, it's a fascinating achievement. Bad is something we can all reproduce, we can all fail miserably at doing a myriad of tasks. This is a movie no-one in this world besides Tommy could have made, an obviously damaged individual with a strange perception of everything and anything human. This is a movie best enjoyed by those willing to be empathetic, those who will genuinely try to understand who was behind the lens and what he was trying to achieve.I give it my full recommendation.",

This film spits in the face of what we have come to expect from movies nowadays, because it is so bad it makes you appreciate the salient techniques used in feature films that are often overlooked. \"The Room\" actually becomes really comical once you accept it for what it is. Its not meant to be a Hollywood blockbuster, but simply a satirical drama to make people appreciate the hard work that goes in to making a good film and how terrible and corny a film can become if its not carefully rendered to fit the public's expectations.",

            "content": "The trailer for 'The Room' claims that it is was best movie of the year. I would argue that The Room is quite possibly the best movie of the decade. Looking back at the big blockbuster hits over this past decade, from the Lord of the Rings to Inglorious Basterds, many of them have left us with a few memorable scenes, and a few memorable quotes to accompany them. But how many films are there where EVERY scene is memorable, and EVERY quote is eagerly anticipated? Grease did it. The Rocky Horror Picture Show did it...and now The Room is doing it. Finally there is a film out there where theater audiences can simultaneously act out , recite lines, and interact with each other...all without having to bring along their mediocre singing voices and goofy costumes.Follow Johnny (Tommy Wiseau) on an emotional journey, where his innocence and blind love is met with betrayal and deception from those who he holds most dear. Meet his unforgettable friends, Mark, Denny, and Peter, along with his future wife, Lisa. Kick back and watch the drama unfold, as Johnny's world begins to turn upside down. If you are thinking to yourself that you've heard this storyline a thousand times over, you're mistaken. Be prepared for a journey unlike any other you've ever experienced.Sadly there are critics out there who contend that this is the worst movie ever made. DO NOT listen to anyone making such ignorant claims, as its simply not true. Let me tell you why. First off, this movie was funded, written, directed, produced, and starring Tommy Wiseau. This much passion and dedication deserves appreciation, in and of itself. Secondly, while it is true that the film encounters some minor subplot holes and scenes that are simply never revisited, one must also acknowledge that such instances have significantly contributed to the film's growing popularity as a fan favorite/cult classic. Finally, this movie is filled with so many unforgettable sequences, quotes, and facial expressions, that even six years after its initial release, it still manages to sell out at the box office time and time again.I have no intention of trying to convince you readers that this movie has the best acting you have ever seen. It doesn't. Nor am I going to tell you that this movie has a fabulous plot or seamless editing. Quite the contrary. But does that make it a bad movie? No! I have seen many movies stacked with great actors and interesting story lines, and they're still awful. Waterworld anyone? The Room is a movie that keeps its viewers completely engaged, constantly laughing, and thoroughly entertained. If that's not a 'good movie', I don't know what is! I encourage everyone reading this review to go out and buy a copy of 'The Room'. Even more, I encourage all of you to gather up all of your friends and buy tickets to the next screening in your area, even if it requires a little bit of driving. This is a theatrical experience that you will be talking about for the rest of your lives. Have you ever been to a movie where you've laughed so hard that you're still crying hours after its over? Have you ever been to a movie where the audience hurls thousands of plastic spoons at the screen...twenty times over? Have you ever been to a movie where the entire crowd has the movie memorized line for line and yells them out in sync? If you have, than sorry for wasting your time. But if you're like me, than you will agree that a movie like this only comes around once in a decade.",

If one looks at the film in an objective and serious manner, it can be considered a complete and utter trainwreck of a film. However like the trainwreck in the old saying, it becomes 'impossible' to look away from.\nThe Room differs from most bad movies in that the negativite aspects which plague most bad films (eg. bad acting, bad writing, poor sound mixing, poor editiing), are amplified to such an extreme that, in combination with absolutely no sense of self-awareness and the bizzare, almost mythical/alien presence of the films mastermind, director, producer, writer and main actor - Tommy Wiseau, 'The Room' manages to be so hilariously bad that it transcends into becoming one of the funniest films ever made. Whereas films like 'Sharknado' and 'Birdemic' set out to deliberately emulate the features which have created many 'so bad its good' movies like 'The Room' as well as others like 'Plan 9 from Outer Space' or 'Manos: The Hands of Fate', they ultimately fail in their endeavors and come across as just plain bad, boring and too forced. The key reason for films like 'The Room' being so funny and memorable whilst other imitators fail, concerns the organic, natural and genuine creative process of many of these 'so bad its good' films, primarily in how said filmmakers genuinely tried to make engaging and brilliant films, yet failed so catastrophically - something 'The Disaster Artist' written by Greg Sestero who plays Johnny's best friend Mark, expands upon in great detail. Overall, 'The Room' is a hilarious, absurd, memorable, bizzare and highly-quotable movie which only gets better with repeat viewings and like a Kubrick classic, will likely be studied and analyzed for decades to come by film students, movie critics and film makers (although likely not for the same reasons).TL:DRBest 'so bad its good' film out there. Highly reccomended.",

The way Johnny and Mark share Lisa at the same time is also a great nod to the great Soviet Union. The red dress Lisa wears, paired with her golden hair is another reference to communism, to the great dictator, Joseph Stalin.The influence this film has on modern cinema is unparalleled. For example, the Oscar-winning movie, \"Parasite\", touches on the same sensitive subject of societal greed, obviously inspired by Mr. Wiseau's outstanding work. The actors do a great job at capturing the raw human emotion, the betrayal of our own nature and the selfishness every human being has inside.

This is the one that shakes your insides so much, it feels like your guts will fly out. Why then? Why do I want to ride it again?My friend and I just finished this film and were left in awe. You can rate some scenes at a 7, but some of them hit you so hard you are left crying out \"12 out of 10!!!\" The acting is atrocious, the pacing is horrific, the unresolved subplots leave a bad taste in your mouth, the diolauge is first grade material, the writing just doesn't make sense, the choppy camera work is heretical, and the sex scenes... oh the slanderous sex scenes... the FOUR slanderous sex scenes. This movie hits every wrong you can put into a movie without missing a beat. But, I'm in love with it. My friend and I love to critique movies. We discuss what scenes could have been changed, what stories could have been tweaked, what plot points could have been done differently, and we thought about fifty different things to move this movie from it's current rating, to at least a 6/10. After further discussion though, we would change not one thing about this movie. Some would argue that tweaking the movie would change it from being \"So bad, it's good\" to just mediocre. Though I agree, I dont agree this movie is \"So bad it's good\". I would argue it's bad. Theres nothing good about it. It deserves to be the worst movie ever made. I felt no investment in the characters, the plot, the story, etc. Yet, I found myself invested in the characters, the plot, the story, and everything in between. I don't know what's happening.This is not some flick that's too dramatic, thus ends up being a comedy, hence making it \"So bad it's good.\" No! There's much more to it than that. You're drawn into the movie, you become mesmerized, it's philosophical, it's beautiful... it's magical. I'm probabaly here, but there is only one comparison that comes to mind that us humans can ponder to existentially relate to the vibes this movie exudes. That is, the final stage of Death and Dying: Acceptance. It's ugly, it's unnatural, but we let go and find peace in the relief. Cinima is definitely a hobby of mine, and love discussing it.

            "content": "What Wiseau's, \"The Room,\" purpose is is highly unclear. Wiseau's own description is is that a room contains good and bad things, though this does not seem well developed, leaving the viewer to decide what the underlying message is. At first glance with no analyzation, it seems that the theme is \"trust nobody.\" However, the main characters are static and flat in every aspect, and contain no last names, one must consider that this film is not just about Lisa, or Mark, or even Johnny. Wiseau's, \"The Room\" isn't a statement about the perils of a love triangle, it is a satirical commentary on a greater societal issue circulating around humanity and how no matter what we get, we will never completely be fufilled, relieved, or reach full satisfaction. Lisa is not satisfied with Johnny, Mark is not satisfied with his relationship with Lisa, Denny will not get Lisa, and Chris-R will not receive the money he wants. The only one exception to this idea is Johnny. Why? His naivety protects him from knowing what Lisa and Mark are engaging in, which in turn would show that Johnny does not recognize what is being unsatisfied in his life. In summary, this is not a mere love triangle that overtly puts forth, \"trust nobody\" but it is more or less a message of \"Satisfaction will never be reached by those who aware.\"",

            "content": "Tommy Wiseau manages to do something amazing with The Room that not many directors/producers/writers/actors can do with their pieces of work. Never before has a movie made me feel so confused, not about the plot of the movie, but about myself. After viewing The Room, I was not sure if I enjoyed what I had watched or if I utterly hated it. The main thing that did this to me is how the film presents itself. It is supposed to be watched as a drama and is meant to make the audience identify with and feel for Johnny, but when viewed in this manner, the movie is just awful. Nate Jones describes what's wrong with the film perfectly. \"The actual film, though, is like a Koch snowflake of badness, wherein any scene has an infinite number of things wrong with it. Conversations start and stop and change topic at random, and the characters speak a strange brand of English that sounds like it has been filtered through three different Internet language translators,\" (Jones). Despite this though, I found myself enjoying Tommy's film. I do not think he meant to do it, but in making a film so horrible, he possibly made one of the best comedies I have ever watched. It's everything about the film that makes it so horrible, that also makes it so amazing at the same time. The moments of the film where I would normally stop watching, were the moments that pulled me farther into Mr. Wiseau's terrible narrative.One of the most apparent parts of the film that is so terrible is the performances. The combination of Tommy's actor choices and writing make for some very interesting dialogue, and by interesting I do not mean in the sense that it was insightful and easy to follow. I mean the exact opposite. The script sounded like Tommy scrapped the whole thing by putting it through a shredder, and then in a moment of realization he decided to save it. There are lines that are used way too repetitively and the film really lacks any truly complex thoughts. However, among all the garbage that this film is comprised of, there are some gems. This film, is one that I quote very frequently simply because there are a number of lines that between their outlandishness, presentation, and comedic value are just so much fun to say. This is another thing about the film that really makes me confused. This film is so awful, but yet it makes it onto my exclusive list of my most quoted films. Me repeating lines from this film such as, \"Oh hi, Mark,\" and \"You're tearing me apart, Lisa,\" shows that this film has stuck with me in a way that very few films do. This is just another way that Tommy has managed to make me so confused about myself. He as physically been able to put his words into my normal conversations, despite his film being so awful. Maybe that's just what Tommy is good at though. I have done some reading and have found some interesting information, specifically what Niki Boyle had to say about his past; \"There's also a chapter towards the end of The Disaster Artist when Greg describes Tommy's 'Birdman' phase: upon arrival in San Francisco in 1978, Tommy commenced building his business empire via the sale of toy birds and yo-yos on the Wharf,\" (Boyle). Mr. Wiseau used to be a salesman, and maybe that's why The Room has stuck with me. He sold his idea to me, and continues to sell it to anyone who decides to plunge into his masterpiece, in an unorthodox and effective way.To conclude, this film is probably the worst one I have ever seen. Tommy Wiseau, being the centerpiece of this film, did a terrible job at presenting the story how he wanted to. His writing, casting, producing, and directing do nothing to help this film. Somehow though, I loved it. Even a few months after viewing it, The Room is still making me so confused. I want to hate it so much, but yet I just cannot. I would rate The Room at ten stars out of ten.Boyle, Niki. \"Interview: Tommy Wiseau and Greg Sestero of The Room.\" The List. N.p., 10 Mar. 2014. Web. 28 Sept. 2014.

            "content": "When I first saw The Room, I laughed my as* off. But the more I watch it, the more it feels like a horror film. This isn't (just) because of the vampire-like look of at the time either 30 or 50 year old Tommy Wiseau (no one knows his real age, either its a well kept secret or he just forgot) but more because of how the film was created. After watching this incredible cluster fu** of a \"film\", I learned that this was created with the intent to win best picture, to be the next \"A Streetcar Named Desire\". What? Tommy thought this would make him a star, so he created this... um... thing to show the world the talent he had. Clearly, he had none. He was a jerk to pretty much anyone who worked on the project, and was a complete creep throughout the production. The funniest thing about this was that HE was the one causing problems, not anyone who he complained about! It took 32 takes for the famous \"I did not hit her\" scene, and lost his crap on a daily bases. He even threw a water bottle at a girl who asked to get a drink of water. On top of the weirdness of Tommy, he owned a clothing store in San Fransisco, two apartments, and got 6 million dollars from the film's \"producers\", which, at the time of filming The Room, were all dead.It's one of the worst scripts of all time, it has the most uncomfortable acting that you have to see to believe. It has the most uneven tone of anything to ever hit a movie theater and makes me question a human's ability to determine whether or not something is complete trash. Because of this, it is one of the greatest films I have ever laid my eyes on. Though it is supposed to be a drama-thriller, it's the funniest comedy of the 2000s, and puts a smile on my face every time I watch. The most impressive thing about it, though, is it's lasting impact. I have attended one of the many late night showings of this film in a movie theater. In fact, the cult following of the film is so big that when you attend these events, there are traditions to complete the viewing experience. From throwing spoons at the screen to being allowed to yell at Lisa for making poor relationship decisions. This isn't just a terrible film, it's a way of life. It's a world you can get lost in. This includes watching hours of videos trying to figure out what kind of mental disease Tommy Wiseau has. Spending money on the book on how the film got made, the copy of the Blu-ray for yourself, the copy to give to your friends to prove something this shitty exists, and pretty much anything you can find on the official movie website. Yes, this is a film that is truly terrible, but due to the amount of love and passion Tommy put into the film, the amount of enjoyment I get when I watch this pile of garbage, and the following that it has which most great films can only hope to get, I'm giving it a 9 not just because enough people give it a 1, but because it (despite it's many, many faults) is the most re watchable movie I have ever given a 9 to. So Tommy, you son of a bit**, congrats, your pile of garbage is now a modern classic.",

It's just that IMDb says that all my future reviews will be discarded if I write a spoiler. So, spoiler alert...kindaHow does one describe Tommy Wiseau's 2003 directorial debut (and may I add, masterpiece), \"The Room\"? Well, much like the work of other fantastic filmmakers such as Neil Breen and Derek Savage, you can't. It's simply impossible. After seeing this movie... you know what? I'm not gonna refer to this as a movie anymore, because it's not. So allow me to begin my sentence again. After seeing this work of art, my life was changed. I never looked at anything the same way ever again. I never greeted certain friend ever again, without saying, \"Oh hai mark.\". I've never looked at two people playing football the same without imagining one of the guys saying, \"I have problem with Leesah, she sed dat I heet hah.\". Allow me to make an argument, in which I argue about the arguments that have been argued about this art piece. First off, some people say that right off the bat, the film shows some locations that were never show again. To that, I say that I believe that Wiseau's meaning with that was that the locations, just like Johnny and Lisa's relationship, is shown, and when it ends, we never look back. We don't see it again. Next up, some say that the performances were bad. But I believe Juliette Danielle's portrayal of Lisa was vigorous and unforgiving. It was a metaphor for how mean and cruel the real world is, and that nice guys finish last. But all jokes aside, I believe this film is something that must be witnessed by ALL people. It's should be on one of those Buzzfeed lists like, \"Things you must do before you die.\". So if you haven't already, see The Room. I hope it changes your life, like it did mine.",

But, there are some things in this movie that I think is really bad . One example is Lisa. Her character has no reason to be the way she is. She just does it because the movie needs an antagonist... I guess, it's just so stupid, there should be something that motivates that person to be the way they are. Like why does she lie that Johnny hit her 'cause he got him drunk and is one of the reasons that Johnny kills himself, because she ruined his reputation, also she cheats on his best Mark. Why does she always have to lie about Johnny, he didn't do anything wrong. Her actions are completely unreasonable.

            "content": "Oh hi, IMDb users.This is not a movie, it is a f*cking travesty. My guess is Tommy Wiseau intended to make an X-rated film but shied away from it at the last minute only to water down the sex scenes (who are about as arousing as the opening credits of The Big Bang Theory, I may add) to an R rating while still sticking to the lousy porn \"storyline\".Indeed, the story (if you can call it that) is essentially about a well-to-do guy called Johnny who at first seems to be loved by everybody. The \"writing\" (it is hard to imagine that any of this was actually thought through and put on paper) already speaks volumes about Tommy Wiseau's own real-life narcissism, but his \"character\" is decomposed completely when his girlfriend Lisa starts cheating on him. None of it makes any sense, and the film itself does nothing but unintentionally expose Wiseau's total inability to deal with life and human emotions. A sh*tload of completely redundant \"scenes\" later - of which only the one where Johnny plays back a recorded conversation between Lisa and her lover could be worthy of a real movie - Johnny kills himself because he feels disrespected by everybody. It is only fitting, then, that the making of this movie itself would be seen as a form of (career) suicide in its own right. One could argue that the so-called cult following of \"The Room\" essentially consists of confused hipsters who have forgotten the difference between genuinely appreciating a form of art because of its aesthetic or intellectual features and ironically enjoying a celebrity publicly break down on Twitter. Indeed, no one in his right mind can pretend to like this thing \"as a movie\": at best, a cynic could experience some form of schadenfreude over its sheer awfulness, wondering why the hell it was ever made (let alone released). Let us hope that James Franco's \"The Disaster Artist\" will somehow help such lost souls re-align their twisted value systems. If this would not prove to be the case, at least Tommy Wiseau can pride himself on having written an appropriate epitaph for his own movie career: \"Here you go, keep the change... Hi doggy!\" - \"You're my favorite customer.\" - \"Thanks a lot. Bye!\"",

It is written, produced, directed by and starring Tommy Wiseau as a banker named Johnny.\r Johnny lives a sort-of happy life in San Francisco, he is engaged to his \"future wife\" named Lisa (Juliette Danielle), I use the term \"future wife\" because that's what this movie is saying. The first problem with their chemistry is pretty much everything, they do not look like a couple...if you saw the two of them walking down the street, the last thing you would ever think is them being madly in love. Wiseau looks way too old for her.\r The first half-an-hour of this movie is four different sex scenes...these scenes drive the movie nowhere, they just put the movie to a dead standstill. The sex scenes are not at all steamy in the slightest...they are actually quite hard to watch.\r Later we discover that Lisa is having some extra on the side, she calls Johnny's best friend Mark (Greg Sestero), and it turns out that she seduces him and they have sex...on the swirly staircase...that is a very interesting location since the bedrooms are only a few steps up the stairs, and that the front door is beside the staircase, so it's a surprise that none of them get caught. That was close.\r There are so many subplots added to the movie that also lead it nowhere, we hear about Lisa's mother Claudette (Carolyn Minnott) having breast cancer, we never hear about this later on in the movie...we even see Claudette in later scenes of the movie and her health doesn't seem to have deteriorated. There is one pointless scene where we see the young character named Denny (Philip Haldiman) getting into some trouble with a big thug named Chris R (Dan Janjigian)...this scene is over before it even begins. And, of course, who can forget the football scenes...\r ...this is really where the film (can I even say it's a \"film\"?) starts to get dragged down by pointless padding. There is this one scene where we see the main characters; Johnny, Mark, Denny and a psychologist named Peter (Kyle Vogt) dressed up in tuxedos, so you think it's finally the wedding day of Johnny and Lisa. Nope! Wrong, they end up going outside, and toss around the football about three times (yes, I counted), and then Peter trips and falls over, and they decide to go back inside the house. What was the point of this scene? If you took this scene out, it would not affect the movie, but then again, it wouldn't improve much either.\r Later on in the movie, Johnny decides to record phone calls as he begins to grow suspicious that Lisa is hiding something. This is sort-of important later.\r We cut to Johnny's birthday party and all of his friends are there...apart from Peter, if you've read Greg Sestero's book \"The Disaster Artist\", you'll know why. Mark and Lisa decide to feel each other up again... during the party!!! And surprise! They're caught, by a random character who we do not know, nor does the screenplay allow us to get into detail about him, he's just some guy that finds out about Mark and Lisa's affair behind Johnny's back.\r Johnny does find out about this affair, and is very angry about it. The thing is; Wiseau tries to position his audience to make us care and feel sorry for him...I don't care...nor do I feel sorry for him. His acting is so over-the-top sometimes, and laughable, you are fully aware that you are watching the film.\r But the worst performance by far is from actress Robyn Paris, who plays Lisa's best friend, Michelle. I know a lot of people say Wiseau's acting is bad, but her acting makes Tommy Wiseau look like Daniel Day-Lewis. Seriously, she is bad.\r The dialogue here is atrocious, too. \"I did not hit her, it's not true, it's bulls**t, I did not hit her, I did NOT\" *throws bottle in anger and notices Mark* \"Oh hi, Mark\". Or try...\"No, I cannot talk about that now, anyway, how's your sex life?\" Who asks like that?! Better yet, there's that famous \"You're tearing me apart, Lisa\".\r 'The Room' is the worst film ever made, period. It drags, there is a lot of padding, there are stories and characters that are introduced, but then are removed abruptly...and the story is generic and uninspired. God knows what was going through Tommy Wiseau's head when he was making this. Although, it is enjoyable, I am rating this a rare 0/10 simply because it is a film that is bad in every level...but on an entertaining level, it does get a 10/10...for all the wrong reasons.\r You're tearing me apart, Tommy Wiseau.",

Me and 7 of my friends were having a movie night yesterday and my friend Stephen brought this with him, claiming \"I don't know what this is and apparently no one on the planet does so we should watch it.\" There was me, Stephan, Mason and Shane who are all male and Anna, Katie, Zoe and Gina who are female (I'm saying this just so I can establish and go into more detail about one of our reactions later) and all of us had different reactions to what we were seeing. Me, Mason Anna and Katie were looking on in confusion throughout the whole thing, Stephen and Shane were laughing uncontrollably, Gina was offended and Zoe fell asleep.\r There was just so much stuff wrong in this thing that I repeatedly asked the question \"why was this made? What possessed Tommy Wiseau to make this? Did he intentionally make this bad? Did he make this to\rsettle debt? Did he actually think he could become a memorable film director?\" I can only answer one of those questions, he became a memorable film director/producer/writer/actor but for the wrong reasons.\r Where do I start? The acting is some of the worst caught on camera. I was in an amateur theatre production by Queen's hall arts called Minor's Strike and I would like to emphasize, it was an amateur production and all of our acting was praised in the performance and I was 13 at the time. These actors, who are around their 30s/40s are acting worse than we did and we were amateurs and hadn't taken acting\rschool at the time. Tommy Wiseau is easily the worst though. He is the worst actor and this film and what goes well with a bad actor you might ask? Badly written dialogue for this bad actor to spout out.\r \"We have a new client at the bank we make a lot of money, anyway how is your sex life\" This is an actual piece of dialogue that was delivered by Tommy Wiseau, imagine that an 8 year old French boy is saying this line and you will get Tommy Wiseau's whole performance.\r There are also these really uncomfortable sex scene moments which is what Gina was offended by. I know that we're in an age where the ESRB raters are awfully sceptical about letting certain age demographics\rwatch certain movies and usually controversy is applauded by audience and that's why Harvester and Hatred got as much attention as they did but this thing in The Room, these sex scenes which is applauded by possibly the horn word (not allowed to say it because of Metacritic's rules) teenage boy demographic, these sort of scenes are just plain awkward for people to sit through. Also, there is about 5 of these\runcomfortable sex scenes in this film, each lasting about 5 mins. Which means the total amount of time we spent watching some porno was just under 1/3 of the film.\r There are also these really weird scenes that don't go anywhere. They happen and then that's it.\r I wish there was a way that I could unsee this film and none of you get this film, even if you're curious, don' get it. I wish to never see Tommy Wiseau in anything again, if he even is in anything else and if he is, there's something wrong with this world.",

It's pretty much like a porn movie without the porn, the conversations are completely non sense, crazy dialogues with zero speech tone, the acting is so bad that you can have some fun out of it. There a lot of sex sequences it the movie that last for many minutes and just for no reason and no meaning, at the beginning of the movie there are 2 sex scenes with the same woman with 2 different men that took like 10 minutes. Some dialogues are just dubbed after the movie in post production, and it sounds awful in the movie, cause it's easily noticeable the change of voice quality between studio and shooting, not to mention the lip movement that ends up getting very weird. I can feel that they tried to put some epic shots, wiht beautiful ambience and some nice music in the back, and it kind of works like how it's done, just not how it was suposed to. But it really makes you laugh and have some fun, that famous punch line followed by the \"hahaha\" that got me everytime. A terrible love triangle story that becomes a GREAT involuntary comedy. Tommy Wiseau, Thank You.",

Random, incoherent script, atrocious acting, sloppy framing, nonexistent story, unintentionally hilarious dialogue. It fails on every base level of filmmaking, but OH MAN is it funny! Most bad movies are forgotten because of how forgettable they are, but The Room is so inept, so random, and so bizarre that it achieves cult-status at how horrible it was!

I'm pretty sure Tommy Wiseau had some sort of message about life and love that he wanted to give us. Maybe even one that was deep and insightful. It's impossible to tell though as the movie is incomprehensible.It runs on a loop of the characters having the same conversations over and over again with the occasional nonsensical moment or long, drawn out sex scene thrown in to break up the monotony. The dialog the cast was given is atrocious and they seem to be playing people who are only capable of making the dumbest possible decisions at any given moment. The acting isn't as bad as you would expect. With the exception of Sestero and Wiseau himself I actually thought there were some decent performances for a movie of this caliber. Sestero seems uninterested in really trying as a result of being fully aware of just how bad the project was going to turn out. Wiseau on the other hand is just a block of wood. Even his fits of rage seem devoid of energy.The direction and writing are just all around terrible. But rather than creating something that's painful to watch, Wiseau's ineptness both behind and in front of the camera inadvertently led to The Room becoming strangely lovable instead. It's still an awful movie, but at the same time it's hard to not be entranced by the unnatural interactions between everybody onscreen as it's all just too funny. As uncomfortable as the sex scenes are to watch I couldn't help but laugh. They have the corniest love songs playing overtop of them and Wiseau apparently doesn't know where the vagina is located. I couldn't tell is he was putting it between her breasts or just had some sort of weird bellybutton penetration fetish. The whole thing is a great source of unintentional hilarity. I'm not sure that's cause enough to recommend it though.1.3/10",

Worst actors, worst director, worst screenwriter, worst lighting, worst editing, worst cameramen, and poof! Genius.Nobody anywhere could ever make a worse movie no matter how hard they tried.

While it delivers many laughs, it is at its own expense, as the comedy is to be found not in the quality comedic writing, but in the acting and horrendous dramatic writing.

How can I avoid releasing a torrent of anger wrapped in objective criticism?The Room is perhaps the worst movie I have ever seen in my life and yes it is probably one of the worst in history, this movie is an argumentative and narrative vomit that lacks of all the basic rules of cinematic language, it is as disconnected as stupid and boring, is as unsuccessful as indescribable and lets say it, the background story of the script has a thematic full of clich\u00e9s but any screenwriter with some talent could have made something respectable from it, but Wiseau's script is a **** disaster. A **** disaster to which he gave a beginning and an ending but everything else is just crap.Believe me, unless you are someone like me who always finishes a movie or worse you enjoy it, I do not know how a regular audicence could find reasons or excuses to continue after the first twenty five minutes.And it's not only the lousy script or the bad direction, The Room is also plagued by such miserable performances that I cannot understand how they moved forward when they were editing. Everything looks neglected, false, overacted and most importantly, everything looks lost and out of focus, not only is the stupidity of the dialogues and the abandoned narrative threads, it's the way in which these things come out of the mouth of the actors. What was their motivation? I ignore it, maybe I should read the book or Franco's movie will throw some answers, otherwise it will remain an incredible mystery for me.Leaving aside the film a little, what concerns me now is what the film has become, because for those who do not know this movie is now considered a cult film, yes a cult film, with special screenings in which Wiseau finally has some success and hhe embrace it without any kind of reluctance, let's say that it was the success he longed for, but it's worth asking if it's valid to find success in mediocrity.Who are to blame for it? Who creates it or who consumes it? And don't get me wrong, I always advocate for what people enjoys or love, but you have to be able to draw a line, because if they convert this type of mediocrity into success what does it says about the spectators? What about the great films that are ignored annually and are condemned to the dark while this is the object of admiration and success? What do we aspire to? Failing in order to achieve fame by being a joke? Honestly with what I've seen in the trailers and the interviews, that's precisely what Franco is doing, maybe Wiseau ignores it or if he doesn't, he let it go, in one way or another the recognition is already his.Honestly, avoid it, stay away from The Room, there is nothing in it nor you will learn anything from it, it is a miserable movie, a crushing failure with all its letters, is bad and yes, not even the involuntary humor works for a ****",

The main character of Johnny instantly made an impression on me from the moment he stepped on screen, and the supporting actors only made him better. Tommy Wiseau is one of those men who can produce, act, direct, and edit all at the same time on a godly level that no one had ever witnessed before now. His performance cemented himself as one of Hollywood's elites and made the already-great supporting cast even more enjoyable to watch. The plot is perfectly paced and varied, with all scenes coming together at the end for an impeccable finale. No talent is wasted or misdirected, and the dialogue is so hauntingly realistic that it makes it hard to believe that the actors were given a script to work off of. Overall this film gets a 9.9/10 from me, the only thing that is holding it back is that the 1.5 hour run time is just painfully short, and makes the film seem like only a snippet of what these talented people can really do.",

This is seen several times in the film as characters walk in a door, then 45 seconds into them being there, declare that they have to go, and leave. Most scenes end in characters walking out of doors.\r You can hear the creepyness in Tommy Wiseau's voice, character, and dialogue. He sounds like he can barely speak english, pronouncing world like \"worild\".\rJohnny, the main character, is almost always seen in a black suit with a loosened tie. Johnny is has long, black hair, that always appears to be the same.\r Most characters in the film express their affection towards Johnny. Close friends talk about how he's their favorite friend, mothers talk about how he is a great person, and store owners tell him that he is their favorite customer. Oddly enough Tommy Wisaeu (who plays Johnny) wrote the script.\r Then comes the sex scenes. Overall, about 1/9 of this movie is sex scenes. They come in at random and unneeded times, sometimes lasting up to 3-4 minutes.

The dialogue is as bad as the acting as it seems like an elementary schooler wrote them and 70% of the time what the characters are conversing about doesn't even make sense along with several pointless scenes that serve no purpose to the story. Several plot points are brought up and then quickly forgotten, and there are some \"filler\" scenes that serve no purpose at all and they make the movie unnecessarily longer than it should have been. Some characters are never even introduced so you'll be thinking who are they and what exactly is their role? The cinematography and quality of the film sucks too, it is obvious in certain scenes that they are behind a green screen and the characters do some stuff that is never really explained (for example: Dressing in a tuxedo and then playing football and doing normal things while wearing it but not ever really finding out why they did wear them in the first place.) What is that supposed to be saying about the idea? The movie after a while can get really boring because it fails to grip you as I was already losing interest before even the first fifteen minutes of the film. There are countless complaints that I can think of for this movie, Wiseau got just about everything wrong but all of these screw-ups do make the film unintentionaly funny and it doesn't help that the film takes itself too seriously and the main plot, it tried to have a good idea going, I give it credit for that, but there were just so many holes and inconsistencies that it fails miserably. Overall, one word to describe \"The Room\" would be \"Awful\", I have never seen a bigger disgrace and failure of a film before. Absolutely the worst film I have ever seen. Only watch this film if you want something laughably bad to watch, otherwise don't watch this film. Verdict: 10/100",

The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of psychology most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head.No, seriously, you have to be fairly intelligent to find this film funny. All of it is completely unintentional. Tommy Wiseau looks at the world through alien glasses. His total lack of self-critique, his almost perfect confidence in his writing/acting/directing is staggering. Not a single thing in 'The Room' is what it's meant to be. Jokes aren't funny, serious moments are hilarious, sex scenes are all the same and off-putting. It takes the one and only Tommy Wiseau to do what others simply can't. This isn't 'a poo on a stick' type of art. This is an attempt to create another Mona Lisa by someone whose painting skills stopped developing at the age of 5. I had a tremendous fun watching this movie. I give it 9/10 only because it wasn't longer. All hail the true galactic overlord Tommy Wiseau!!",

It really is a terrible movie. Words cannot really describe the terribleness, but I will attempt it nonetheless. 1. The actors are terrible. The characters they portray are idiotic beyond the measure of a Stanford-Binet test. There's one character (excluding the main character who... again, words escape me in trying to describe the terrible acting) who is just downright creepy and just left me with an urge to punch the screen. Random plot points are quickly introduced, forgotten just as quickly. A character mentions they have a terminal disease. One sentence. You will never hear about it again thereafter. One scene involves a classy costume change for a group of men for an unexplained reason. Plot be damned, this movie defies logic. And the dialogue. I don't even know where to start on the dialogue. Really, this movie leaves me confused in that it's difficult for me to explain the terribleness of the film when you haven't seen it. But if you watch it, didn't the self proclaimed writer/producer/executive producer/director/composer/cinematographer/genius, Tommy Wiseau get what he wanted? Doesn't that actually make him some sort of deranged genius? It's the little things really, like giving this movie any score above a 5 that will eventually add up to create societal collapse, and our grandchildren will curse us for it.",
