            "content": "I must admit that when i watched this movie for the first time i didn't really think that much of it. Sure the acting was amazing, but that was expected. But then something happened. I got a chance to read the book by Dennis Lehane and suddenly all the pieces fell into place. I watched the movie again and this time it was amazing.I don't know how i should interpret how my feelings toward this movie changed after reading the book. Is it a good adaptation if i like it more after reading the book? Should a movie stand so well on it's own merits that the book is not necessary? I don't know myself, all i know is that it all became so much clearer after reading the book.First of all the acting was amazing even the first time around. But still, after reading the book it was as if the characters gained one more level of depth. I have always felt that Tim Robbins is the true gem in this movie. His pained portrayal of the lost soul Dave Boyle is pure magic, seldom has an Oscar been so well deserved. Sean Penn is predictably great in his portrayal of Jimmy Markum. It's a difficult character, a person you really don't know what to think about. In one respect he is a worried father, in another respect he is a cold-blooded man with few things to like about him. The rest of the cast is solid, with Kevin Bacon the brightest star among them.When it comes to the plot itself this was where much was changed from reading the book. The trick is not to watch this as a crime-drama. Rather it's a movie about behavioral patterns, about humans. What they are capable of and what dictates their actions. There are huge amounts of sadness and melancholy to this story. Of people unable to break out of the path it seems life has chosen for them. This i think didn't really break through to me that well when i watched the movie for the first time. But the book is much more clear on this and when i watched the movie again i saw it there as well.In the end this is a triumph of two things really. First the great acting of some of the finest actors in Hollywood today, second the sensitive and thoughtful directing of Clint Eastwood. He manages to bring out Dennis Lehanes story in a way that is so understated and minimalistic at times i didn't even catch on the first time around. But if i look closely all the elements are there and it is truly a great adaptation as well as a great movie.",

            "review_title": "Falls sort of greatness but superb nonetheless",
            "content": "Lovers of great acting had best not pass up 'Mystic River,' Clint Eastwood's powerful, award-laden adaptation of Dennis Lehane's best-selling novel. Sean Penn, Tim Robbins and Kevin Bacon play three working class Bostonians forever bound together by a mutual childhood tragedy that has since gone on to define the kind of people they've become and the kind of lives they've led. The film begins with a brief prologue as we see the three youngsters - Jimmy, Sean and Dave - out playing in the street one day, when they are confronted by a pedophile who, posing as a policeman, tricks one of them, Dave, into getting into the car with him and another man. Fast forward to the present as we pick up the trio as grown men who have, for all intents and purposes, gone their separate ways. Penn is Jimmy Markum, a former petty thief who spent two years in the slammer but who has since turned straight and now owns a neighborhood liquor store. When Jimmy's daughter from his first marriage turns up murdered, the three men's lives intersect in ways they could never have imagined. Bacon is Sean Divine, a homicide detective assigned to the case, and Robbins is Dave Boyle, a sporadically employed man who may be a prime suspect in the murder. Dave still lives with the trauma of that earlier soul-shattering experience, while Jimmy and Sean wrestle with why they managed to escape the cruel finger of fate that pointed so grimly at their hapless playmate. The film is about how the events of our early lives (and, in the case of Jimmy, it doesn't stop at this one incident) can end up coming back to haunt us later down the road.The Brian Helgeland screenplay makes the pain that each of these men experiences vivid and palpable. The grief Jimmy feels over the loss of his beloved child, the psychological torment Dave suffers as a result of his abuse, and the bewilderment and loneliness Sean experiences from a failed marriage all become integral to this dark tale of bitterness, revenge and attempted healing. At times, we do find ourselves wishing that the script would concentrate less on the details of the murder investigation and more on the inner workings of the three main characters. Too often we feel as if we are only scratching the surface of the roiling psychological torment taking place deep in the bowels of these men. The plotting, particularly towards the end, often feels more contrived than it needs to be, with heavy-handed ironies and obtruding parallelisms that don't seem to know when to leave well enough alone. Laura Linney, as Jimmy's second wife, has a key Lady Macbeth moment late in the film that might have been effective had we been more fully prepared for it and had her character been more thoroughly developed throughout the course of the film. As it is, the scene seems to come out of nowhere and leaves us both bewildered and hanging.Still, these are minor quibbles when it comes to a movie as finely acted and directed as this one is. Penn hits all the right notes as a man facing the worst experience life could possibly throw at a person - the murder of one's child - trying to make sense of a tragedy that defies any rational explanation. Robbins beautifully underplays the role of a man scarred forever by what happened to him in his youth, now endeavoring to function as an adult when he was robbed of any semblance of a childhood. Bacon is excellent as the man who attempts to put all the pieces together, not only of the case but of the shattered lives he and his two buddies have been living all these years, and Marcia Gay Harden is outstanding as Dave's loving wife who struggles with what is perhaps the greatest moral dilemma faced by any character in the movie. Linney, Lawrence Fishburne and Tom Guiry offer fine supporting performances.As director, Eastwood allows his superb cast ample time to develop their characters, never hurrying the proceedings along and always allowing the conversations to play themselves out. He recognizes the quality of the material and feels no need to gussy it up with self-conscious camera angles or fancy editing. He also uses the bleak settings of blue collar Boston as an effective backdrop to the stark, chilly tale he is telling.Perhaps it is just an odd coincidence that three of the very best movies of 2003 - '21 Grams,' 'The House of Sand and Fog' and 'Mystic River' - all suffer from the same tendency on the part of the filmmakers to move away from reality and towards melodrama and contrivance in the final act. Of the three, '21 Grams' and 'The House of Sand and Fog' are harmed less by this than 'Mystic River' because they have a somewhat deeper thematic base and richer character development than does the Eastwood film. Still, 'Mystic River' is a mighty impressive achievement for those who made it and a rich, memorable experience for those who see it.",

Some pedophiles arrive and pretend to be cops and they kidnap and rape Dave...who, fortunately, is able to eventually escape.Years pass and the three men are grown. Jimmy (Sean Penn) is a family man whose youngest is about to take her first communion. However, he and the family don't realize that his oldest has been brutally murdered. When he learns of this, he vows revenge.At about the same time, Dave (Tim Robbins) returns home very late. He's bloody and cut...and his story about attacking a mugger seems contrived. There also is a boyfriend of the dead girl...and he has some 'splaining to do. And, there are a couple detectives who are investigating all this and one of them is Sean (Kevin Bacon). What really did happen? Who really is at fault? And, will the police get to them before Jimmy and his thug friends?\"Mystic River\" is occasionally tough to watch, as it deals with child sexual abuse, murder and extreme violence. It's also quite grim. Because of this, you should consider all this before watching the film. This being said, it is a very good film and features some amazing acting...so if you're up to it, by all means give the film a look. I appreciate not only the acting but all the false leads and clues...and the viewer will not so easily piece it all together.",

            "content": "Twenty years ago, the boys Jimmy Markun, Sean Devine and Dave Boyle are neighbors and pals, playing hockey on the street. One day, Dave is kidnapped by two men, being sexually abused, but escapes from them four days later. In the present days, each one of them followed one way in their lives: Jimmy (Sean Penn) is married with Annabeth Markum (Laura Linney), has three daughters and has a small business. Sean (Kevin Bacon) is a detective, and his pregnant wife left him six months ago. His colleague is the detective Whitey Powers (Laurence Fishburne). And Dave (Tim Robbins) is a traumatized man, married with Celeste Boyle (Marcia Gay Harden) and having a young son. When the nineteen years old daughter of Jimmy, Katie Markum (Emmy Rossum), is found dead in the neighborhood, the three friends in childhood meet each other again, in the investigation of the murder. A tragic event happens in the conclusion of this investigation. This movie is excellent. Yesterday, I saw it on DVD and I was impressed with the direction of Clint Eastwood and the performance of the cast. It is almost impossible to highlight one actor or actress, but I was stunned with the performance of Sean Penn. It is a film based on the acting, and not on special effects, shootings or race of cars. I was very impressed, since the tragic story of the loss of the youth is very real, full of human flaws, disturbances, prejudice and judgements. The destiny of this movie in the future may be to be considered a contemporary classic. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): `Sobre Meninos e Lobos' (`About Boys and Wolves')",

            "review_title": "Character Study in a Minor Key.",
            "content": "Most murder mysteries go the way of unleashing tension and a mounting sense of suspense and danger as the plot originating from the murder in itself reveals red herrings and a more sinister plot underneath just waiting to be discovered.Clint Eastwood's thriller goes a completely different direction: while the identity of the killer is still at the center of the story and is revealed in almost surprising -- but plausible -- sequence, this is more a powerful character study of three childhood friends joined together by the very horror of a life extinguished. All three actors make their roles their own -- Sean Penn is quietly intense and devastated, Tim Robbins is the ultimate broken man through circumstances not of his control who still relives his own tragedy every day, and Kevin Bacon plays a stoic detective who also has some relationship issues of his own.If there's one weakness in the movie it's the way the women are written. While Marcia Gay Harden fares better in her portrayal of a housewife who discovers what she believes to be a deadly secret involving her husband (Tim Robbins), Laura Linney, while being strong in her own role, is a little underwritten throughout and her sudden change at the end is a little inexplicable though chilling and recalls Lady MacBeth's speeches towards MacBeth.A very bleak take on the notion that some people never learn from the mistakes they make in life and how those mistakes come back to rip their own life apart in the most subtle of ways, one of the most emotionally dark movies of 2003 and completely deserving of its Oscar wins (for Best Actor and Supporting Actor, a feat repeated in this years Oscars for 2004) and nods.",

            "review_title": "The acting was superb, but the ending was...",
            "content": "Mystic River was a film I knew for years but haven't watched until now. It won 2 Oscars in the best actor and supporting role category, so I was stoked to watch this at some point.Lo and behold, the acting from these actors were very good. Sean Penn played the tough guy mourning father incredibly well, while Tim Robbins showed his internal struggles constantly on screen. Even to the end, how Tim Robbins acted with Sean Penn in the final act was insanely well done. You can see how he struggles with the truth and how far he's willing to go to live.Other than that, the story is a bloody mess. The movie dropped the ball so incredibly hard in the final act. One primary issue is how everything seemed to line up perfectly given the timing of events. Dave just happened to kill another man in the same time frame as Jimmy's daughter went missing, and that he just happened to be in the same bar as Jimmy's daughter as well. Of course, the story double dips on coincidental events, with Sean figuring out who actually murdered Katie around the same time Jimmy killed Dave. I understand a story is fictional and have to rely on coincidences to drive a story forward, but when you fully rely on coincidences to drive the drama of the film, it feels cheap and contrived.There were also some questionable directing choices, like what was the point of not showing Sean Devine's wife during their mysterious phone calls? That arc was also barely explored, and it felt like it was only put there so you didn't feel as devastated after what Jimmy did to Dave.Let's talk about the other female characters: Jimmy's second wife. The insane speech she gave at the end came from nowhere. We had no idea she was this crazy person okay with her husband killing an innocent man. We also have Dave's wife who, when directly asked by Jimmy, nodded to her husband killing Katie? This whole movie essentially was just filled with people making decisions when they're rationally not able to. It's mistakes after mistakes.In a way, Dave's wife confessed to Jimmy because of her fear and lack of understanding for her husband. In a way, Jimmy killed Dave because of his hot-headedness and revenge-obsessed worldview. Yet, we have no explanation for why Jimmy's wife applauded him for killing an innocent man. Like, the only thing you can say about her is that she's utterly crazy, because we've given no information of who she is.The movie also chose to end deliberately open so we don't know if Sean will eventually have enough evidence to send Jimmy to prison, and it appears a similar cycle will begin again with Dave's child when he finds out the truth. At the end of the day, Mystic River explored the irrationality of men when a devastating event occurs. It explored how violence perpetuates more violence and how some people cannot get out of this loop.In that it succeeded in what it tried to do. However, the story relied on way too many coincidental events to push the emotional impact and behaviours of its characters, lessening the quality of the story as a whole. I believe the story would've been much better explored if it was a TV series so it can establish all the characters. Without these details, it just appears certain characters are crazy and some scenes become completely irrelevant.",

            "review_title": "Long Live the King?",
            "content": "After three eleven year-olds from a close-knit lower middle class Boston suburb undergo a tragic experience where one is abducted and abused for four days, their lives diverge. The abducted one never overcomes the emotional trauma, another begins a life of crime, and the third becomes a cop. None ever venture very far from the neighborhood. When tragedy strikes again, their lives are gradually brought back together on a collision course that leads to some unexpected results.Mystic River is a surprisingly dark film, with a controversial denouement. It is masterfully directed, acted, shot, edited, lit and scored. It is a mostly humorless and occasionally difficult realist drama, that will undoubtedly affect most viewers emotionally in a variety of ways--you may cry, you may become angry with at least one character and the lack of just deserts, and you may find it a bit depressing, although producer/director/composer Clint Eastwood and scripter Brian Helgeland do through in a relatively minor glimmer of hope/happiness at the very end.Not that I tend to agree with awards organizations, but it should be no surprise that Mystic River has fine acting. A bulk of its many awards and nominations, including two Oscar victories, were for on screen performances. What is less recognized is the positive effect that the locations, cinematography, lighting and score have on the atmosphere of the film. Kokayi Ampah found the perfect, generic, metropolitan lower middle class neighborhoods, buildings and bars. It could be any slightly depressing, but maybe about to gentrify, suburb of Boston, New York City, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Chicago, Detroit, or any number of at least Northeastern and Midwestern U.S. cities. Tom Stern's cinematography is continually, subtly inventive. Just check out the shot of Sean Penn where shadows from a railing form symbolic jail bars on the wall behind him. The lighting tends to the late 1990s/early 2000s look that is more monochromatic and leaning-towards blue. There are a lot of well-placed shadows, often creating a chiaroscuro look. Eastwood's score is understated but very effective. And how can you not like a film where three sexy girls dance on top of a bar to jazz fusion?The story is absorbing. There is an unexpected (to me, at least--I try to watch films the first time knowing as little about them as possible) mystery angle that is effectively sustained until almost the end. I haven't read Dennis Lehane's novel yet, but I just ordered it after seeing the film--the film piqued my interest enough to want to explore more. But the most interesting part of the story to me, at least, was the extremely gray depiction of Penn's character, Jimmy Markum. Markum is revealed to be largely criminal, and not quite likable in his attitude towards his daughter (he doesn't respect her individuality, even though she's actually an adult). Yet at the same time, he is compared by at least one character to a \"king\", and in many ways, he is treated as one in the neighborhood. This may or may not be meant more metaphorically by the character saying it, but it is possible to read much of the film as being about a traditional king trying to live in modern day metropolitan suburbia. In some historical and cultural contexts, surely Markum's behavior in the film would have a more noble sheen, including his \"mistake\". This is perhaps why poetic justice never arrives, and instead, the character is seen as contented, with his queen and court by his side, being regaled with a parade instead. In modern contexts, many kings' behavior would not be so noble, and instead we'd notice more the injustices done to the peasantry and sympathize with them. Markum's character cannot be depicted more literally as royalty, as if he were far removed from the socio-economic status of the film's peasantry (although we find out eventually that he has more money to spare than most folks in his neighborhood), because it would be instead read as a moral tale of economic disparity as is exists solely in modern times. Putting everyone on a level playing field, more or less, is the only way to create a parable of how kings would be perceived, solely in terms of their decisions and actions, in our era.Of course, there is more to the film than that, and it's not the only interpretation possible (in fact, it probably seems very left field to many readers), but it's worth pointing out not only as something literally interesting to contemplate, but to show the kind of storytelling depth that is contained in Mystic River--a film you should not miss.",

There are additional themes explored here: childhood trauma, consequences for our actions, connections from the past, ripple effects of neighborhood tragedy, etc. These elements are carefully intertwined with the main storyline which is what keeps Mystic River a step above its peers.

What it really is, is a manipulative revenge tale about the sensitive inner life of a vigilante murderer. I  was appalled by Laura Linney's big scene at the end where she praises the murderer for his kinglike qualities. I think it's in there not so much for its ironic 'Lady Macbeth' horror, as for its balancing effect on all those moviegoers who actually agree with her and see the Sean Penn character as flawed but heroic: a kinder, gentler Dirty Harry.   There's a reason why the film makers eliminated a crucial moment from the book: In the book, the Kevin Bacon character promises the Marcia Gay Harden character that he will prove that the Sean Penn character committed murder and that he will prosecute him for it. Instead, Eastwood plays it cozy, leaving the legal consequences of the vigilantism ambiguous, just in case his core audience happens to think that what Sean Penn's character did was wrong, maybe, but understandable and justified. And after all, who got hurt? Just some loser pervert, right? Or as the film describes him, \"damaged goods\". What a load of horse manure.",

He escapes after days of abuse but is scarred for life.  Years later he has married but is still a little mixed up, Jimmy is an ex-con and Sean is a police officer.  When Jimmy's daughter is found murdered, he seeks revenge \u0096 whether it be through his own route or Sean's police work.  The three old friends are brought back together in a variety of ways.I had heard mixed things about this film before I saw it but I wanted to see it on the strength of the cast and the director's names.  The plot starts with a horrid scene of abduction which, while far from graphic, has a sense of foreboding about it that is very unnerving.  After this the film jumps forward and we are led into a detective story that touches on the past and how it affects our lives today.  The connections are sometimes very poorly delivered \u0096 for example the whole affair relating to Sean's wife is just out there and never really understood in the context of the film.  Likewise a lot of the other connections seem to be an afterthought to the main detective story \u0096 I haven't read the book but I got the impression a lot of it had been crammed into a short time with mixed results.The end of the film itself exposes the uncertainty the themes are mixed. Jimmy's wife's speech is confusing in it's intent, Sean's reaction (both the happy conversation and `finger gun' gesture) is inexplicable \u0096 the ending seems to wipe clean the lives of these two characters, although the regret and loss of Dave's wife is shattering in how it is portrayed.  Where the film is strongest is in the characters \u0096 they keep the story moving and are a good mix of personalities.  Sean is the least well explained but is still a good solid character when you ignore his subplot.Bacon is sort of the main character of the three as he drives the investigation, he is given good support by Fishburne \u0096 who I was able to stop seeing as Morpheus after about 5 minutes.  Penn is a great actor but he isn't a great fan of `everything in moderation' and he gets very hammy at times.  At one point in the film he is surrounded by a group of policemen and howling at the moon with grief \u0096 if you get the dvd and freezeframe it you can clearly see that Penn's shirt cufflinks are actual bits of bacon because he is just a big slice of ham!  For the majority of the film he is actually very good, but at key moments he steps up way too much.  Much better due to his underplaying, is Robbins.  His character is much more difficult and I suspect that the least he will receive for this is a nomination for best supporting actor.  Of the women, Harden stands out. Although her character is a little hard to grasp in terms of motivation, her performance is powerful.  Linney is good but has less to do until near the end.The direction is very solid \u0096 full of majestic sweeps and nice shots.  The music is a little overwrought; as if the film needed the music to do the emotional work for it.  The one thing that bothered me is that Eastwood clearly sees this as his next Oscar \u0096 he has a worthy, depressing film and fills it with worthy/grand shots with the intent of being worthy enough for the Oscar.  I did get the feeling that his heart was as much into getting the Oscar as it was in making a film for it's own sake.Overall this is a quality film, but it is a flawed quality film.  It aspires to much \u0096 but much of what it wants is just outside of it's grasp.  It is worth seeing as a film driven by good characters painted large by very good actors.",

Immediately, a whodunit case arrives. Sounds average, dunnit?...No. It's much more than average. What might appear as a normal murder mystery is more. The acting, particularly from Robbins and Penn, is immaculate. Robbins is still recovering from child sexual abuse along time ago. Penn, so realistically and amazingly, mourns over the loss of his daughter. Laurence Fishburne (playing cop Whitey) is as smart talking as ever, whilst Kevin Bacon gives a solid performance as the homicide cop investigating the case.Though the film becomes a bit uneven towards the end, this tough, brutal and uncompromising; but still, a masterpiece, and the best work Eastwood as done in years.Final Analysis: 9 out of 10",

            "content": "Call me simple, but I just watched Mystic River for the first time last night and it appears to condone the killing of the character played by Tim Robbins in a sort of, \"Well, he's been all messed up since he was raped and molested as kid, anyway, so doing him in does everyone - especially him - a big favor.\" Excuse me, but I think that's a terribly brutal message to send. Yes, physical and emotional abuse can cause untold damage, but there are ways for people to seek out treatment through therapy.The best thing about this film is how most everyone kind of 'expects' the Tim Robbins character to be found guilty and is surprised in the end. The fact that the writer makes 'Dave' actually complicit and responsible for _another_ murder does not wash with me as a sort of way of saying 'Well, he deserved what he had coming to him' as is insidiously and mischievously implied. It seems like a cop-out to me.The bottom line is that Sean Penn's character brutally murders his childhood friend based on hearsay and the third friend, played by Kevin Bacon, suggests he will just look the other way even though it's pretty clear he knows Penn did it. And he's a cop!So what the f*ck is going on with the little speech Penn's character's wife gives at the end of the film? \"You could be the king of this town?\" Maybe true, but also clear is the fact that he's going to be eaten by his demons in the process.And all of this is OK? Watching the freaking parade stand murderers and friends side by side? Being guilty of murder is OK as long as you atone for it? Let's put our attention and hopes on the next generation? Am I the only one to find this to be a bunch of crap?",

            "content": "Three young friends play in the Boston street. They start to misbehave and a car approaches and a man climbs out looking like a cop, acting like a cop and seeming to have police ID. He beckons one boy over. He says they are going to take the boy somewhere (home maybe?) - the others say nothing and look on, glad it isn't them.However the man is not a cop, he is a child molester/sadist and has taken him to rape and quite possibly later murder. However, several horrific days later, the boy escapes to freedom - nevertheless what happened to him and the two others will never leave them. It marks every day of the rest of their lives: and for Dave (the kidnapped boy) the wounds run very deep in to his flesh.I am frightened of saying it, but Clint Eastwood is now America's best director: and not only that, he is one of the bravest. This is not the most obvious film. Dark, mean and giving little security blanket to hang on to. Thankfully he has assembled the best cast anyone could ask for and all three co-leads (the three street boys that go on to be men - Sean Penn (Jimmy), Tim Robins (Dave) and Kevin Bacon (Sean)) are excellent. Also worth a mention is Laurence Fishburne as a laconic black cop with a firm but fair attitude.This film is not really much about women nor is it flattering to them. The later actions of Dave's wife (Marcia Gay Harden) make little sense on any level unless clues lie on unfilmed pages of the Dennis Lehane novel. Further discussion of it would be a spoiler.The plot could (falsely) read as a whodunit or thriller: Jimmy's (an ex-con who now runs an convenience store) daughter is murdered and two main suspects quickly emerge. A boyfriend who was about to elope with her and the former abused boy Dave who had seen the girl behaving slightly wildly in a bar on the night she was killed. To make things worse Dave had come home late with a stab wound from that very night - he was \"stabbed by a mugger,\" so he says, but the cover story makes no sense.To complicate things further Sean (Bacon) is now a cop on this very case with female problems of his own. Thankfully they are mostly off screen because this film has enough problems for several movies. He is no longer open friends with Jimmy, but clearly he is viewed as more than just an ex-con trying to make good. People that have read the book say that it remains true to its pages and that maybe is the reason why things happen slowly and the end is not an absolute full stop. The thriller part of exercise creaks like an old door because we have to believe that the Dave incident was a giant coincidence or he was - somehow - involved. And if so, why?I was intrigued as to why the three central characters should stay loyal to the area. What keeps them? Especially Dave who everyone views as damaged goods and not a crime victim. Even his own wife. As I said before, Jimmy runs a store (where did he get the money - from crime?) but has a criminal past and maybe even a criminal future if some of the people he is around are anything to go by. This is not a film that believes in total revelation.I am also puzzled by when the \"present day\" is meant to be. There is confusion about whose blood was found in a certain place which would have been solved easily by DNA examination. They talk only of blood groups.Hmmm...Despite its many faults this is serious and skillful film making and while I agree with another reviewer - that television does this kind of the thing better - that isn't to say that this isn't a welcome addition to the cannon of believable (in outline form) street drama involving imperfect people trying to make the best of things in very difficult circumstances.",

            "content": "Let's say it straight away: before \"Mystic River\" (2003), Clint Eastwood's last works had left me a little unsatisfied; particularly \"Blood Work\" (2002), a watchable thriller with a certain charm but without great originality. But the following year, with \"Mystic River\", he made a sensational comeback and quite obviously this movie, which critically and commercially gave a boost to his career is his most accomplished since \"Unforgiven\" (1992).By watching \"Mystic River\" one can feel that Clint Eastwood, more than ever put a lot of effort into the elaboration of his movie. From a subtle screenplay written by Brian Helgeland who shows that he is a far better scriptwriter than director (as far as I'm concerned, I hated the rather insipid \"A Knight's Tale\" 2001), Eastwood develops an absorbing and ingenious directing which contributes in weaving a shady and even stifling by moments atmosphere. On another extent, Eastwood takes back a way that had worked for him in \"Blood Work\": favoring calm and patience. And indeed, on an unhurried pace, the film-maker takes all his time to shot the evolution of this detective story. More important, he made this choice for another reason: to do a thorough psychological study of the three main characters. The basis of \"Mystic River\" consists in a classic detective investigation (nevertheless passionating in its construction) doubled with a relevant description of the three main protagonists.To watch \"Mystic River\" is like to find oneself on the edge of a forest and to disappear into it. The more the movie progresses, the more we discover three heart-broken characters because they are linked by dark events. First, Jimmy Markum (Sean Penn). We learn that he has flirted with violence and has spent a few years in jail but he seems to have become a well-behaved man: he works in a grocery store and regularly goes to church. But the death of his daughter crushed him and he is determined to avenge her. Then, Sean Divine (Kevin Bacon) who appears as a reliable and lucid cop but whose private life is hell: he experienced a failed marriage and his wife keeps on harassing him day and night. At last, Dave Boyle (Tim Robbins), a broken father who underwent a deep traumatic experience (he was kidnapped and raped by two men who claimed to be priests). The consequences are terrible: he can't communicate anymore, he can't defend himself anymore and he wanders like a ghostly figure in the streets of his neighborhood. As a matter of fact, this traumatic scene is at the root of the three characters' misfortunes. Being the very first sequence of the movie, it sets the tone of Clint Eastwood's 24th movie. It presents Jimmy, Sean and Dave playing in a street. The sky is gray, the houses of the neighborhood are bare and austere. The ball which disappears through the manhole may symbolize the loss of childhood. Then, a big black car arrives. One of the men gets out and claims to be a priest (or does he?). He orders Dave to go into the car and the latter drives away. This moment will haunt the three boys for the rest of the lives and will deeply influence their personality. Roughly, \"Mystic River\" demonstrates in a conclusive way how such a past dramatic event can influence our present lives.In virtually all the critics I have read, \"Mystic River\" was hailed for its cast. It's true that Penn, Bacon and Robbins rank among the best American actors of their generation and I think we will never thank Eastwood enough for having reunited them. By giving a lot of depth to their respective characters, one can feel that they were giving their all, which can explain why the movie was shot in a rather short time (39 days). They may even never battle their dazzling performances. And the rest of the cast is just as equal as the whole, especially the actresses whose female characters have an important role in the story since they influence (unconsciously or not) their husbands' actions and characters.To a third degree, Eastwood's major work is also used to denounce the deceptive superficiality of the appearances, the omnipresence of violence and the credulity of many inhabitants. The film opens with an overview of the neighborhood but doesn't show yet that it is devastated by violence. No matter what the time is. Violence is omnipresence and the fact that it touches younger generations proves that it isn't ready to subside.At last, let's also congratulate Eastwood for the remarkable music he has signed himself with his son. With this music, simplicity rhymes with efficiency. One has just to listen to a few notes to feel an intense emotion inside us.In the middle of all these qualities, there are just minor faults. So, Bacon is a tormented cop due to his disastrous marriage and however, we really don't know what went wrong with his wife. Is it Dave's kidnapping? Is it his trying job? This point remains ambiguous. Ambiguous is also the adjective that suits the best to qualify the end of the film. What can mean the gesture Bacon makes to Penn? But these two points let freely the way to any possible interpretation.The contribution of the crew in Eastwood's work is total and so is my enthusiasm for \"Mystic River\". If you haven't seen it yet, go and watch it. You won't regret it. At the age of 73 years old, \"grandad\" Clint Eastwood is still in great form and given the recent triumph of \"Million Dollar Baby\" (2004), he seems to have decided to bring the house down again in the landscape of American cinema for our greatest pleasure.",

            "content": "Clint Eastwood is a remarkable guy. As he eases into and through his 70s, he's taken more chances than ever, unlike Howard Hawks and so many other artists, who repeat themselves as they age. He's explored new milieus in each of his later movies -- a Western with no heroes, women's boxing, a disappearing ethnic neighborhood, the tragedy of heroism, the social elite of an alien Southern city, an even more alien world of doomed Japanese warriors. And he's done it all with a relaxed grace on happy sets. Not all are successful but each embodies an ambiguity that's stunning. They're adult movies, made by an adult for adults. Kids aren't going to be cheering the good guys because there are no good guys.This is the one about the kind of ethnic neighborhood in which everyone seems to know everyone else. The kind that's rapidly disappearing, in this case Boston Irish. (The New England accents are just marked enough to fall short of parodies.) Three men have grown up together, their lives interwoven in various, rather complex ways -- Kevin Bacon, Sean Penn, and Tim Robbins. Bacon has grown into a police officer. Penn is a thug who's spent time in the slams. Robbins is a tormented wretch. The story is hung on the peg of a murder. Penn's young daughter is beaten and shot to death. Bacon probes the case. Robbins, by coincidence, has been involved in a murder that has nothing to do with the death of Penn's daughter but which makes him look guilty nonetheless. Penn, a man of violence, becomes convinced of Robbin's culpability and murders him. When the true perps are revealed, Bacon realizes that Penn will never admit to the mistaken killing of their mutual friend Robbins, but Bacon will need to try pinning him for it, so the two men are now at odds with one another.That's the plot. The real story deals with the exploration of character and of how we are shaped by events that happened long ago, events that we may not even remember with any clarity. The pacing is deliberate, the dialog naturalistic, the mistakes human in their nature, and the location shooting is realistic. (No tours of Harvard Yard or the Old North Church -- just working-class neighborhoods.) In addition to the three principals, Eastwood has assembled a fine cast that includes Marcia Gay Hardin, Eli Wallach, and Laura Linney, among others. None of them are glamorized in any way. Closeups reveal Robbin's stubble, Linney's papules, Penn's nevis, and Bacon's blemishes. But none of it comes across as cruel, any more than our looking in the mirror every morning is an act of cruelty.I guess one of the things that's most impressive about Eastwood's articulation of these settings is that none of them was ever his own. As a child of the depression he followed his father around California, mostly working at gas stations. He's reserved and not especially articulate in interviews. His signature (which I saw on the menu of a Chinese restaurant in Monterey) is the drawling set of loops of a high school student more interested in athletics than aesthetics. A very rich man, he voted for H. Ross Perot. He was never a cowboy, never an effete homosexual snob, never a Boston Irish kid, but he manages to make these characters come alive for us. Who would have dreamed that there was an embryonic artist maturing under that shabby poncho?",

Mystic River is a depressing and simple story jazzed up by over-acting and music (written by Clint Eastwood) that sounds like a grade-school etude exercise. Why is it that contemporary auteurs believe that lack of a sensible plot, comic relief, and meaningful themes can be overcome through extreme close-ups of actors mimicking emotional turmoil, lingering for eternities as Penn's eyebrow twitches or Robbins pouts. Essentially, Penn thinks his old pal Robbins whacked his daughter, so he whacks Robbins. Oops, made a mistake. That's the story. The backstory involves childhood sexual abuse, and has nothing to do with the plot. It's tacked on to the side with a few pins related to where Robbins really was (whacking a child molester) and why he was such a loser (haunted, of course). Unfortunately, the film does not address in any meaningful fashion the issue of child molestation. It also does not handle the murder mystery very well, since the actual killers of Penn's daughter turn out to be related to Penn in a way that would make a hack writer blush with shame. Mystic River is also riddled with gangster flick clich\u00e9s most writers discarded decades ago -- the Savage (!) brothers who do all the dirty work, the crusty wife who encourages Penn's criminality like Lady Macbeth, the cop from the old neighborhood (Kevin Bacon) with mixed feelings about the gangsters he investigates, and the (old man) river (running through it) that serves as \"silent witness,\" and so on. This is an altogether mindless, humorless and simple flick all done up with production values and more meaningful looks than a Mexican soap opera.",

Separated by time, one day Sean receives a call to investigate a murder, and the one who died was Jimmy's daughter Katie. Faced with this tragedy, the friends meet again and the plot begins.A good movie that promises suspense until the final scene that you can be sure is not predictable, maybe it frustrates a lot of people because in fact it's not the ending you expected.

            "content": "WARNING!! MAJOR SPOILERS!!I don't know what the movie was supposed about. I liked the first three-fourths of it, but I cannot recommend it.  I think it is full of logical inconsistencies, especially involving the characters.Take the Kevin Bacon character:  At one point, he tells his partner Laurence Fishburne that he will put the cuffs on his friend faster than Fishburne will if his friend (Tim Robbins) is guilty.  This establishes him as a guy who puts duty above friendship.  So why does he not arrest Sean Penn at the end of the movie when he knows Penn killed Robbins?  Either he does his duty or he doesn't.Take Fishburne's character:  What happens to him at the end of the movie? Where is he? He would be the first to investigate the missing Robbins character, whom we know is killed by Penn.  Somebody would be investigating his disappearance. Is it just an unsolved murder or disappearance?Penn's character: He gets established as a loving, caring father who went straight after serving time because he loved his daughter. We see him say to his daughter's picture something like `I know I contributed to your death but I don't know how.'  He is by himself, so that should be an indication of a caring, thoughtful guy, which, to me, he turns out not to be by the end of the movie. He is cold and ruthless. In movies, when we are shown characters doing something alone, it is an indication of what they truly are. That is like a contract the movie makes with us. He also knows that Robbins was abused as a kid.  Yet he kills Robbins based only on circumstantial evidence.  Robbins's wife thinks that he killed Penn's daughter.  But Penn has got to be smart enough to want more evidence.  Then he kills Robbins in front of 3 guys who will be surely grilled and leaned on by the cops because it is well known they associate with him.  A bartender also saw them all together.  And Penn would have to know he was a prime suspect. Wouldn't a guy like Penn be shrewder?  Wouldn't he late till later, and have it done when he has an alibi?Robbins's wife, Marcia Gay Harden: She seems to be a pathetic character by the end of the movie.  At first she seems caring, consoling Penn's wife after the murder.  But she suspects her husband murdered Penn's daughter and tells Penn and not the police.  Who is that dumb?  Did she not want her husband to get a fair trial?Laura Linney's character:  She is Penn's wife.  We don't see her or get much sense of her until the end of the movie. Then, as others have said, she turns out to be Lady Macbeth.  She tells her husband Penn that it is good that you do what you have to for your family.  Why could that not simply mean turning Robbins over to the police?  She then tells this cold-blooded mobster of a husband that he could run Boston!!  Then they roll over on the bed and have sex?!?! Only cold, ruthless people do that.  Why should I care about them?Coincidences:  Robbins just happens to kill a guy molesting a child the same night Penn's daughter is accidentally killed?  And Robbins just happened to be in the last bar that Penn's daughter was in? And Penn kills Robbins just before Kevin Bacon's character, a cop, tells Penn he has the real killers? These seem like very cheap plot devices. Too improbable to be believed. How about Penn and Bacon?  They end up being very awful guys, yet they were not the one abducted or molested.  Sure it happened to their friend.  But it is too much to believe they would be so affected.The characters for most of the movie seemed sympathetic.  But at the end, none of them, except possibly for Robbins's character that got into a car as a child with a child molester who pretended to be a cop (Penn and Bacon were there, too but did not get in) are sympathetic at the end of the movie. Penn gets back together with his estranged wife and seems to be happy with his life, so why bother investigating the murder of his friend Robbins even though he knows Penn killed him?  YUK.  At a parade, he makes his hand look like a gun and gives a sort of fake POW! pointed at Penn, like you're the man buddy.  Or this is as much as I will do to you.  And we see Penn surrounded by two or three of his thug henchman.  Penn seems to have no remorse for killing Robbins.  Linney gives Harden a sort of so what look, I don't care what happened to you.  Harden walks around looking very sad and pathetic. Penn and Bacon don't seem to care how sad Robbins's son must be. We can see how sad he is a float with other little leaguers.  There seems to be no reason why we should care about the characters played by Bacon, Harden, Penn or Linney.  They are all despicable and unlikable people.And it is not okay somehow that Robbins is dead because he killed a child molester, either.  If I were on a jury trying Robbins for that murder, it would be hard to give him the death penalty.  The movie seems to be saying that was some sort of justice that he got killed.  Yet his murder of the molester was not premeditated like Penn's murder of him was.  Or the conscious decision of Bacon to be okay with Penn killing Robbins. And the way Penn killed Robbins is brutal, painful and demeaning. Penn treats him in a very mean spirited way. The movie seems to be saying this is okay. Again, YUK.",

            "content": "\"Mystic River\" has received rave reviews around the world. It's been called one of the best pictures of the year and it's likely to get the Oscar. Why? I'd say it's because \"Mystic River' with its fake power fooled people and critics as usually bad movies do. The perfect example is `A Beautiful Mind', `Forrest Gump', \"Titanic\", etc. `Mystic River' is fake and disappointing. Aside from the predictability and triviality, I found the acting unconvincing.I can honestly say that \"Mystic River\" is one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. It pretends to be so moving, dramatic and powerful, but it fails in all counts.`Mystic River' tells the story of three men who had a difficult childhood. One of them was `supposedly' raped, and the others had different problems. As time went on, one of them had problems with his missing wife and the other with penal antecedents.Let's begin by the countless mistakes: 1. At the beginning of the movie we see these three men in their childhood. 25 years go by, but the characters look terribly old, especially Sean Penn's. It's ridiculous they'd get so old, while Kevin Bacon's character looks rather young. In fact much younger than his friends.2. The movie is overdone. There wasn't a scene that I found powerful or completely believable. Sean Penn is annoying. His performance is over the top, without his showing any real feelings. He tries so hard and makes it what it is `A mess'.3. Tim Robbins also overacts. He is too ridiculous and his lack of seriousness as an actor is evident. He was `supposedly' abused as a child, but eventually he marries and has a child. He keeps his frustration inside himself, but then he shows his anger by killing a man who was abusing another child. That's too much easy and farfetched. Oddly enough it happens the same day, in which Penn's character's daughter is brutally killed.4. The wives are completely disagreeable. They just keep sobbing and hugging each other making this an annoying flick. I'd have felt for them, but the story is so contrived and pointless that it's hard to do so.5. The score is dull and lacks liveliness or even a dramatic touch to make it at least more powerful, but it's the same foolish music over and over again.6. Kevin Bacon's character is a waste of time. I don't see the point of his being in the movie at all. The whole movie would've been the same without his presence. It's contrived that he's a murder investigator and that he has a missing wife with a child and at the ending they just appear again like a fairy tale.7. The ending is terribly weak, predictable, bad and laughable. It left me with the feeling as if it were good to take the law into your hands and kill the suspects of the murder of your daughter, and then feel proud of doing so. Then at a parade Kevin Bacon's character with his wife and child happily smiles at Mr. Penn's character. It's just corny and completely annoying. In a way it reminds me of the triviality of `The Hours', but in a masculine version. They are both disappointing and gushy and they're both over praised.`Mystic River' without a doubt is a huge disappointing. The fact that it was shot in 39 days says so. It was a haste effort with no depth and accuracy looking contrived and unbelievably trite. 3/10",

In what is a poignant moment captured beautifully by the director, the boy leaves his friends behind as he watches from the rear window of the car until it disappears further into the distance.\nThen we pick up threads of the story years later where the three children are now adults living in the Boston blue-collar neighborhood near Mystic River with each character examined in turn as they go on with their lives, affected somehow by that long ago incident that has left one of them (Tim Robbins) permanently damaged in mind and spirit.All of the performances are riveting and each deserves high praise. Sean Penn as the unruly father with a troubled past is remarkable, displaying an array of emotions that mark him as an exceptional actor. Tim Robbins, in a muted performance, is excellent--as is Kevin Bacon, now a police officer who is called to duty when Penn's daughter becomes a murder victim. Suspense is maintained throughout and there are several powerful scenes of graphic violence.The story is fascinating and the performances are all first rate, including Marcia Gay Harden as the wife who suspects her husband is a killer, and Laurence Fishburne as the brusque but efficient police sergeant who is partner to Bacon.There is one major flaw: despite all the craftsmanship--the writing, the direction, the cinematography, the music--the revelation of the girl's killer comes as a disappointment since there is no preparation for it in the script--and furthermore, it seems a highly unlikely solution. Up until that point, the film is on track all the way--but things fall apart swiftly in the last fifteen minutes. But in the meantime, we have been treated to interaction of some very human and believable characters for whom the rough and raw language seems appropriate, if a bit overdone.Summing up: A fascinating and distinguished piece of filmmaking despite this obvious flaw in the plot's outcome.Trivia note: Watch for Eli Wallach in an uncredited bit role as Mr. Looney, the elderly proprietor of a liquor store.",

That was so completely out of character for her, the way she is portrayed for the rest of the film.2. Jimmy being portrayed as some sort of a poor man's Godfather is not entirely convincing. Him killing Dave is even less so.The Ugly: 1. Lauren Devine's (Kevin Bacon's wife) character is utterly ridiculous. And you are left wondering why she returns to Sean (Kevin Bacon) in the end. Talk about resolution with no logic.2. Kid killers and the killing: The way the killing happens is so random, you are rendered \"speechless\" (sorry, one of the kid killers is mute). The behavior of the two kids after the killing, is very unnatural. They go around as if nothing happened fooling everyone. Yet Dave completely unravels after he kills a pedophile (understandably so). 3. The ending: a. Gosh, talk about an unsatisfying ending. The last 10-15 minutes spoils the entire film which until then is running great! b. Sean's reaction to Jimmy after he gets to know he killed Dave is again out of character especially after he knows that he also killed Just Ray. Yet earlier, he reacts with righteous indignation when he is accused of going soft on Dave as he was the suspect. c. The parade scene ending gives a load of \"what's going on here?\" moments shot after shot. Certainly the low point in the film.Yes, the review is harsh but I still hold on to the 7 stars rating. It is well worth a watch for sure.",

            "content": "Your bitter reviewer walked into the theater with high expectations, I had to beg my fiancee to see this, promising her the masterpiece that the hype said it was. It was, to put it gently, not as good as an average episode of \"Law and Order\". The characters that weren't overdone or hopeless cliches (e.g. Celeste) were given no consistent motivations or satisfactory explanations for their actions (Jimmy, Sean). The movie waffles on the strength and extent of the boys friendship; Are they still friends? If so, do  Dave and Sean know that Jimmy is a small time mafioso? Is all of Boston related to each other,  at least six of the major and minor characters are cousins, including Jimmy and Dave (by marriage I assume) yet supposedly they barely know each other anymore. Celeste was a horrible character, first the whole film she looked like she'd scream and cry if her kid or anyone else sneezed. Then she sells out her husband to Jimmy, someone who will most likely at least beat him within an inch of his life if not kill him and then sells JIMMY out to Sean after the situation she brought about has climaxed. This is not a woman you want to go hunting with. And the murderers, where do I begin? Sean said they HAD NO MOTIVE. This is bad writing. They just wanted to play tough guys and the random passerby, the victim, just HAPPENS to be his brother's girlfriend and not only that, the daughter of the hood that his father ratted out when he was most likely two and sent up for a stretch. The kid had no way of knowing, and I give the movie credit for not suggesting it, that Jimmy murdered his father. To top it all off, if this was a random act and an accident that she died, why did they abuse the body? Like I said, bad writing. Kevin Bacon's last five minutes in the movie is on repeat somewhere in actors and filmmakers Hell. He goes from hearing about his friend's death, someone he obviously feels indebted to, to laughing and smiling on the phone to his creepy, stalking wife. He follows this gem with the \"finger gun\" during the parade with a bizarre smirk on his face. Methinks making movies like \"Wild Things\" has damaged the acting center of his brain. This movie is nothing what critics or the hype said it would be, there are better films by all these actors and this director, both in front of and behind the camera. Go rent those.

The main leads are for Sean Penn, Tim Robbins and Kevin Bacon. Furthermore we have Laurence \"Morpheus\" Fishburne, Laura Linney and Marcia Gay Harden. The movie itself is very dark and sober without much music. The story is brilliantly written and the acting is without any doubt superb.I'm glad Sean Penn finally won an Academy Award, he's a brilliant actor and he certainly deserves the recognition. Tim Robbins was good as well, but I think Benicio del Toro should have won the Academy Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role. His performance in \"21 Grams\" was much more superior to Robbins' performance in \"Mystic River\". Anyway, that's just what I think. Kevin Bacon was excellent as well and he is one of the most underrated actors of his generation. Marcia Gay Harden and Laura Linney were good as usual.Although I very much enjoyed this movie, it didn't exactly turned out to be the masterpiece I was expecting. But that's maybe because this was only the first time I watched it. Anyway, I'm still looking forward to see Eastwood's masterpiece of this year: \"Million Dollar Baby\".

            "content": "Mystic River deals with three men, once boyhood friends, who all estrange the people closest to them. Their characters become flawed because of events, of how they choose to be, or their calling. It doesn't really say anything profound, but the acting and screenplay in the first half are quite good. Brian Helgeland, whose script writing seems to veer between brilliant (L.A. Confidential) and fairly abysmal (The Sin Eater), provides three quarters of sheer maestro, a story that unfolds with a growing sense of unease; characters that, as in real life, feel no need to state the obvious but let us piece together clues. But a gripping story of childhood bonds gone bad, murder, the frailty of human certainty and belief in flawed values \u0096 all wonderful elements that should offer a filmmaker so much \u0096 are stymied by flimsy resolutions and ultimately unlovable characters. An edge of the seat mystery builds to a limp climax that rather suggests they ran out of money, or film or ideas. There is no great moral dilemma as some critics have tried to suggest \u0096 all the characters try to do good in their own screwed up way, some with better intentions than others, and most of them fail. Mystic River has a stellar cast \u0096 Tim Robbins, Sean Penn and Kevin Bacon to name a few \u0096 and there are some excellent performances. Penn, in the lead role, is sadly perhaps the weakest of these three as he is seems far too conscious of those \u0091Oscar worthy moments', with the camera closing in for yet another close-up of his lingering, tortured, seemingly over-rehearsed expressions. Actors who go through this phase need a rapid infusion of French Cinema to correct their hyperbaric egos if they wish to ascend loftily and gracefully through stardom. Robbins and Bacon seem far more comfortable with their roles, without the need to be centre stage quite so much, and Marcia Gay Harden, who has already collected one Oscar for her role in Pollock, is quite superb, playing a long suffering wife with what seems like suppressed hysteria growing into panic. Mystic River is a good film and worth going to see - but such a shame it isn't another cinematic masterpiece we feel we can still hope for from director Clint Eastwood.",

            "content": "I vomited when I first saw this morally bankrupt film and I am still feeling queasy writing this. \"Mystic River\" has the outward appearance of a worthwhile drama until you come to the clincher, which is that, in life, there are weak people, people you can execute without proof of their guilt \u0096 or who deserve to die or be raped, or both, like the Tim Robbins character, because they can't defend themselves or can't manage to be loved or respected by their wife or, like the dead girl, because she tried to escape her father's control. And then there are the strong who murder and rape other people and can get away with it because they have sexually satisfied and lobotomized, loving wives and they benefit from a strong support network in their community. The strong characters happen to be mobsters and the film glorifies their lifestyle. In all respects, this film is a practical manual for the application of Nazi principles to daily life situations. This would be enough to qualify \"Mystic River\" as the best screen adaptation of \"Mein Kampf\" so far, if you don't count the works of Cronenberg or Tarantino. But wait, as they say, there's more...The Tim Robbins character having been kidnapped and sodomized by heterosexual authority figures when he was a kid, grows up to attack a homosexual man having sex with a teenager in a parked car (we're talking about consensual gay sex, here). He brutally kills the man in retribution for his past. The discovery of the victim's body only serves, in this film, to confirm Tim Robbins' \"innocence\" of another crime, because the life of a homo has absolutely no bearing in the equation of life, death and justice in this twisted universe. In a Greek tragedy, the fact that Sean Penn's daughter was killed by the children of a man he has himself killed earlier would have been considered delayed justice or the work of fatality (i.e. divine retribution). Not in this film, it ain't! Sean Penn has already avenged himself on the wrong person (the \"loser\", the weak guy, Tim Robbins) and he walks away scot-free from this horrible act of stupidity and primal bestiality with the help of his loving wife (Laura Linney in a masterful performance) and the complicity of his childhood friend, the cop (Kevin Bacon), because (1) the cop considers that he has more things in common with the perpetrator of this crime (Penn) than with its victim (Robbins) since they share the same pagan values of the \"school yard code\", which says that it is simply not cool to snitch \u0096 which also happens to be the Mafia's founding principle; (2) both men are normal heterosexuals who share the same penis obsession (the penis must prevail), Kevin Bacon being more preoccupied with his marital problems (born of a typically macho lack of communication with his wife) than with upholding the law; and (3) gangster Penn has the means to buy the silence of Tim Robbins' widow (because, as usual in this kind of film, crime pays very well, thank you).The finale is particularly stomach-churning: The two happy heterosexual couples (Penn, Bacon and their subservient wives) are all smiles as they bask in the noon-day sun while the unworthy female (Robbins' widow) hides her shame in the shadows. Because she is the real guilty party, don't you know. She snitched\u0085\"Mystic River\" is just another chapter in the long history of the glorification of gangster and hit man values in modern American films, which started with \"The Godfather\". It is a piece of degenerate filth with an A-list veneer. It also deifies the invincible heterosexual paternal phallus, which must be respected and worshipped at all times, as a perfect representation of Bush's America.",

I am recommending against it because itmasquerades as relevant drama but is barely more than a collection of TeeVee-inspired shortcuts.I won't mention the shortcomings other than to remind that there are always two thresholds in film -- or any art. The first involves whether a work is competently shaped and at is at least clever, intelligent or adventurous. This film certainly is that. In fact, all the principles in this project are famous in the industry for no-nonsenseprofessionalism, especially Clintywood.But the other threshold is whether the matter of the art is something you can use in your life. Naturally, that varies from life to life depending on how they are designed -- or more likely were accidentally accreted. In my case at least, the thing that saps usefulness in this for me is the notion that problems in life are explicable. Everything here has an explanation, in each case a repetitive bludgeon of \"sense.\" This is Rush Limbaugh hits drama and is repellant in form.So much for that. What makes this fit my `worth watching' category is the way we can see the battle royale for control over how images work in our imagination. Two of the primary forces in conflict are those of actor and director, each with entirely different motives. Actors provide the stuff we see, like ink and letters provide the stuff of books. Directors (and often the supporting `designer' arts) provide the physics of the world of the story.Between them is a mystical river, a collaborative tussle that sometimes results in an effective narrative. Here we have three of the most interesting actor-directors alive: Eastwood, Penn and Robbins. Each of these has radically different notions about what the nature of this collaboration is.Penn is the most interesting to me. He works with multiple parallel dimensions. He feels that the only films worth making are `folded,' at the level of the physics of the world. He has created two masterpieces with this: one as a director in collaboration with Jack Nicholson (`The Pledge'), and another as an actor in collaboration with Woody Allen, also someone interesting in this space (`Sweet and Lowdown').Robbins is interesting as well. He made a terrifically intelligent film in `Rock the Cradle' that uses a writer/director's vision to deliver an Altman-inspired physics to an ensemble, allowing them a means to collaborate among themselves using the same director-actor vocabulary. Interestingly, he has also directed Penn in a project designed to work around his wife's inadequacies. Even in this, the collaboration was with Penn.Eastwood has more confidence in personal style and less tolerance for metaphysics. He grew up in an environment where the stylistic intuition of the director was all. Deliberations and introspective design are a waste. The actors work with you on style or they get fired.Three radically different views about how films work. All of these three ways are visible here because Eastwood seemingly doesn't care about anything beyond the style, and allows private collaborations so long as they don't step on his territory or schedule. Watch here as Penn and Robbins form a director-actor collaboration, a mystic connection outside of Eastwood's physics. It peaks toward the end as Penn -- as director in the character -- literally destroys Robbins' character as a character and diffuses him into the mystic.Watch earlier as Robbins bends all the actors around him not only as an actor, but as a surrogate director. We may never see Marcia Gay Harden be more layered. (She came close in the similarly structured `Gaudi Afternoon.')As the story progresses, we have these three directors each given play, like a jazz trio of sorts. (Eastwood's score seems to give three themes accordingly.) Rock, paper, scissors.The end is jarring, Linney's speech let's us know that Eastwood is aware of hidden manipulation.

            "content": "I honestly don't understand why some consider this a great film. It's got mostly decent acting, directing, cinematography, music, and the like, but frankly the drama seems mostly manufactured out of unlikely coincidences which destroy any illusion of reality. Take away those and you're left with an average episode of \"Law & Order: Criminal Intent.\" Three childhood pals encounter a couple of pedophiles pretending to be cops. One is abducted and abused for four days before escaping. Over the years the friends drift apart ... one becomes a cop, one becomes a criminal (now supposedly reformed), and the third, the one who was abducted, manages to get married and raise a family but has trouble keeping jobs.One night the daughter of the ex-criminal is murdered. That same night the ex-abductee comes home covered in blood and with his hand injured, and he gives people different stories about what happened. Meanwhile, the cop is called in to investigate. The police initially suspect the ex-abductee but then their investigation pulls them in another direction as they learn more about the ex-con's past. While this is going on, the ex-con and his crooked friends are doing their own hunt for the killer.So how's it all turn out? Well, it seems the murder was actually committed by a couple of idiot kids in a prank gone bad. They intended to pull this prank on a random motorist, but that random motorist just happened to turn out to be the girlfriend of one of the kids' older brother. Meanwhile the ex-abductee really had killed someone that same night, but it was a pedophile he saw molesting a kid in a car. But the hotheaded ex-con kills his old friend before the cop can unravel the mystery and catch the real killers.Come on. This requires more suspension of disbelief than your average fantasy film. We are asked to accept far too many coincidences. Let's list them: 1. One childhood friend, who suffered trauma as a kid, sees the daughter of another childhood friend, an ex-con supposedly gone straight, on the night she's murdered.2. This girl is killed by a couple of kids trying to pull a prank on a random motorist. However, the random motorist just happens to be one of the kids' older brother's girlfriend.3. This older brother happens to have a father who had reason to dislike and want to seek revenge on the girl's father.4. Meanwhile, this same night, the first childhood friend kills somebody else, injuring his hand in the process, and leaves that person's body someplace where it's not found for several days, which coupled with his seeing the victim on the night she was killed naturally leads to him becoming a suspect in that murder.5. The cop who is called in to investigate the girl's murder is a childhood friend of both the victim's ex-con father and of the man who was abused as a kid and who saw the victim on the night she was killed.How often does anything remotely like this happen in real life? Yet I've heard this movie praised for its stark realism. Please.Don't get me wrong, if you can manage to suspend your disbelief and focus on the acting and other good aspects, this is an OK film, even though there are other problems besides the coincidences. For example, the way the ex-con's wife is revealed to be a rather cold-blooded b***ch who easily rationalizes away her husband's inexcusable crime, when there is no inkling of this aspect of her character earlier in the film. And the cop character's inexplicable behavior after his ex-con childhood friend basically confesses that he has killed their other childhood friend out of a mistaken belief that this man had murdered his daughter. He not only does not arrest the ex-con on the spot, as he gets into his car and drives away he smiles and talks happily on the phone with his wife as she tells him she's coming back home.Yeah, I suppose it's a kinda \"gritty drama,\" but realistic it's not.

In this case, however, it was clear that Eastwood was still honing his craft.For a basic plot summary, \"Mystic River\" tells the story of three childhood friends now grown up but still intertwined with each other:-Jimmy Markum (Sean Penn): The intense, mob-dealer type who's daughter is murdered and provides the investigative basis for the film. -Dave Boyle (Tim Robbins): At the beginning of the film, as a child, young David is kidnapped and abused. He's clearly never gotten over that experience. -Sean Devine (Kevin Bacon): A cop on the Markum murder case.The good thing about this movie is that it contains enough interesting themes (both physical and emotional) to keep the viewer engaged. You'll really be curious as the movie unfolds to see how all this will turn out.Here's the problem: In a rare moment of Eastwood being \"off\", most of those interesting themes either die off with no explanation, or lead to conclusions that are unsatisfying. In, say, \"Million Dollar Baby\", Eastwood is perfect in resolving all the themes and character development. In this effort, he fails at that task.That being said, this is still an okay movie.

The ugly opening scene of the sexual assault (even though not on screen) is something that every one of us can understand. For that child to be dumped back into his neighborhood, first as a victim, then a pariah, is really sad. These boys become men and husbands and fathers. They wear their violence on their sleeves. They don't respect--they strike out--without thought. Others back away. Some say the acting is a little overdone--but that would make Brando's performance in \"Streetcar\" overdone. Everyone is wound so tightly. There are several scenes that are so riveting, the death of Sean Penn's daughter at the top of the list. Penn's reaction is so memorable, as is the subdued performance of Kevin Bacon's homicide cop. As the the angst and tension build to a conclusion, we want these guys to find some happiness. Unfortunately, the die is cast in this gut wrenching film. Clint Eastwood at his best.",

            "content": "\"Mystic River\" is a very American take on genres more usually evoked by Europeans, a sophisticated cross between the kitchen sink working class British films and the spare, family-style murder mysteries of Claude Chabrol and Fran\u00e7ois Ozon, and that has only otherwise been achieved in the U.S. through whole seasons of \"The Sopranos.\"The clues to the mystery are subtly given to us within the first ten minutes when we meet the very individual yet deeply connected characters embedded within a powerful sense of place, isolated from downtown and change by the titular geography, with the looming bridge a constant visual landmark, only a notorious traffic bottleneck to most Bostonians. My friend in Cambridge explains the geographical symbolism: \"The Mystic River is Boston's \"other river\"--unlike the picturesque Charles, the Mystic is the working river lined with power plants, factories etc,---the neighborhood is supposed to be Charlestown--traditionally isolated, working class, old school so to speak,(and yes, much of Boston remains unpleasantly insular) that has been \"yuppified\" over the last twenty-five years, especially since the mid-eighties when the Orange Line elevated train came down. The Tobin Bridge that you see connects Charlestown, part of the City of Boston with Chelsea to the east, a separate municipality. The Mystic and Chelsea Rivers flow together into Boston Harbor--the working docks are in Charlestown, Chelsea, and East Boston across the Harbor from the North End and from Charlestown. In point of fact, some of the scenes were filmed in East Boston, as well as the Fenway and Franklin Park in Jamaica Plain.\"The accents aren't completely accurate, but at least some regionalism is attempted. Overlooking it from the bridge, one of the key trio early on calls it \"the old neighborhood,\" as he's somewhat left it, as in parallel his wife has somewhat left him, but both keep feeling silent tugs to come back.Memory and time catches up to the audience too in seeing two of our finest actors as gray-haired fathers (very natural make-up and hair style work), but Sean Penn and Tim Robbins are masterful as damaged men and even more damaged parents haunted by their mutually touched yet separately karoomed past and present. They are living demonstrations of Faulkner's dictum \"The past is never dead. It's never even past,\" with horrific consequences for all.The strong theme of the sins of the fathers keeps the men up front, but their wives are crucial fulcrums for loyalty and motivation, as they are in The Sopranos, and Laura Linney's and Marcia Gay Hayden's characterizations chillingly match the men one-on-one at the climax and conclusion.The constant sense of brooding unease is promulgated enormously by director Clint Eastwood's masterful music which floats up like a body in the river and keeps up the tensions in even quotidian-seeming scenes. Sound in general bubbles up for atmosphere, from Red Sox games to telephone rings.The cinematography is lusciously saturated (Tom Stern doing his first lead, up from lighting) for gray skies that ironically clear up to blinding sunshine at the uneasy end, for a neighborhood parade that celebrates Patriot's Day while most of Boston is doubtless cheering on the marathoners.

            "content": "One thing is certain, this film would not have passed muster under the Production Code of the 1930's and 40's. Not only does it show someone getting away with murder, but it also involves a lawful authority complicit in the knowledge that a former childhood friend did it. I thought this was a masterfully constructed story until it got to those final revelations. One might consider all the interconnected relationships between the various characters to be stretched beyond credibility, but while the story was taking place none of it seemed forced. The opening sequence with the three principals as young boys went a long way to explain the emotional pain Davey Boyle (Tim Robbins) went through his entire life. For his own wife (Marcia Gay Harden) to believe that Davey killed Jimmy Markum's (Sean Penn) daughter demonstrates how fragile their own relationship had become. What bothered me about the story were twofold. When Jimmy actually admits to his wife Annabeth (Laura Linney) that he killed Davey - first, I couldn't believe he did that, and second, her response was to make him feel better about it. No revulsion, no disgust, it was simply out of character to a normal human reaction for that kind of admission. The other problem was Sean Devine's (Kevin bacon) reaction as a police detective. One can only assume, because no clear motivation was offered, that Sean felt Jimmy had gone through enough with the death of his daughter, and at a time he was dealing with his own marital problems. But that really doesn't cut it. His gun-hand gesture to Jimmy at the community parade was really bizarre, I just don't know how to process that.So this may not have been a clear directorial win for Clint Eastwood, but it was a valiant try. Not being a fan of Penn or Robbins, I can appreciate the Oscar wins in their respective categories, I thought they were well deserved. I just would have hoped for a little more thought put into the final outcome to temper the crimes committed with a more appropriate lawful resolution. You don't need a Production Code to convince viewers that there was something off-kilter with the way things turned out.",

After Sean Penn's daughter is killed, the police investigation coincides with Penn's vengeful path, culminating in a scene along the waterfront with Tim Robbins that was so predictable (and so belabored by the director, Clint Eastwood) that I had to fast-forward through it. The only character worth caring about is Marcia Gay Harden's sad sack spouse; projecting a distaff variation on the household cuckold, Harden does amazingly well with a role that is one-dimensional by screen writing standards--her only weak scene comes when husband Tim Robbins, drunk and babbling about the past, elicits nothing more than a round-mouthed look of concern. The film is done up in stylish steely blue-grays and features big scenes for the cast members, but I thought Sean Penn's quietest moments (his \"throwaways\", if you will) were his best; his crying binge on the porch (with no visible tears) isn't really a scene at all in the emotional sense: it's just an actor's warm up. ** from ****",

For the whole movie, you remain detached to every character, and by the time you are out of the auditorium, you have forgotten the movie. You do not sympathetize for any character - not even for the murder victim.Most of the incidents in movie are unrelated. The friendship between three boys, or the mental anguish Dave suffers due to kidnapping, has nothing to do with the theme of movie. Even if they would not have been friends in childhood, the story could still hold ground, as no hint of friendship is visible in current relationship.Even the character backgrounds are quite irrelevant. Jimmy is a convenience store owner, but also a mafia. Sean is separated from his wife. I wonder if this aspect really helped the movie anyway. As for Dave, I wonder, if he ever worked to sustain his family. All the time, he is seen walking on the street like a drunk man.The movie tries too heavily to create a feeling analogus to \"Road To Perdition\". Typical grey looks, old buildings, no glamorous characters, a pessimistic feeling throughout the movie. However, it ends up like a body without a soul.An overrated film, but looks more like unrelated incidents coupled together. There is a scene where Jimmy goes to morgue to look at dead body of his daughter. You can clearly see the girl breathing, with the dress on her body going up and down to breathing.

            "content": "**SPOILERS**It is part of our humanity to contemplate the effects of a single event. For Jimmy, Dave and Sean, that event occurs early on in their lives, when they are all eleven years old. Their characters are setup from the outset: Jimmy is an adventurous kid with a love to live life on the edge; it is his brilliant idea to take a car for a spin around the block in their Boston community. When Jimmy grows up he spends two years in jail for criminal activities. Meanwhile, Sean thinks stealing the car is a bad idea. He grows up to be a cop. And then there is meek Dave, who doesn't really have much to say about anything at all. And when a so-called \"cop\" commands Dave to climb into the backseat of his car, he does so reluctantly, never stopping to argue. The other two kids run home to their parents and soon a search is conducted for Dave, who escapes his captors four days after being held in a cave in the middle of a large wood. We are left to merely imagine what occurs within.When the three kids grow up into adults, not much changes. Jimmy (Sean Penn) owns a convenience store and the love of his life is his nineteen-year-old daughter, who is brutally murdered on the weekend she plans to run away with her boyfriend, the son of a crook who ratted out Jimmy and sent him to jail for those two years, and whom Jimmy sought revenge on after being let out. The close links are deliciously ironic. It doesn't help that a plot revelation reveals (spoilers ahead) that the handgun used to murder Jimmy's daughter was the same gun used by Ray Harris, his betrayer, during a liquor store shoot-out in 1984.What follows is a grim, sometimes painful to watch, unraveling of a mystery-thriller that actually relies upon realistic characters and dialogue for backbones. Penn, who won a Best Actor Oscar for his portrayal, arguably delivers the single greatest performance of his entire career. After being nicknamed the King of the Oscar Snubs, he finally received his comeuppance, and incidentally he deserves an Oscar for \"Mystic River\" more than ever before. His performance is, simply put, absolutely stunning. He manages to capture the essence of a grieving father. The segment in which he arrives at the scene of the crime has been hard for me to watch both times I've seen the film: Penn delivers a completely convincing, almost startlingly raw outburst that sends chills up the audience's spines. For anyone who has a loved one, it is both haunting and stirring, and an ode to the fact that if you hand an ensemble cast a great script and let them stand back and do their thing, it can sometimes turn out absolutely perfect. A lot of scenes in \"Mystic River\" seem as though Clint Eastwood, the director, stood back a bit and let things unravel on their own. The chemistry between the actors, and the frequently obvious ad-libbing, is something that was found in many older films but is rarer nowadays. Eastwood has rediscovered this aspect of filmmaking and I hope to see it more often in the future.Tim Robbins' performance is somewhat more low-key, but still stellar in its own right. Robbins' character, Dave, changed when he was abducted -- after his return it is not explained that his life has never been the same, but smartly and subtly implied that something is wrong by Eastwood, and the scene in which Dave finally snaps in front of his wife -- who thinks he has murdered Jimmy's daughter after he returns home the night of the crime with blood stains and a cut hand -- is disturbing and powerful. Eastwood's gritty turn behind the camera is especially surprising given the man. To be honest I never thought that Eastwood was capable of making such a brutal film.The most underrated performance is that by Kevin Bacon. Although Sean Penn rightfully received far more recognition for his outstanding achievement, Bacon manages to present the audience with a completely nice cop who's trying to get to the bottom of the case without hurting any friends in the process. What's so great about Bacon's performance, and what I found interesting, is that he abandoned his Bad Guy image (from \"Hollow Man\" to the semi-bad-kid in \"Diner\") and has managed to give us all a very likable, but yet also very realistic, image of a cop. He has played other \"good guy\" roles before but this is one of his most memorable. I've found that Bacon seems most at home when he's playing sadistic characters, and in \"Mystic River,\" I believe it must have been a challenge for Bacon to play a nice guy. A great actor once said that he finds playing good guys much harder than bad guys, and this probably relates to Bacon's performance.The movie is led by an all-star cast, including Laurence Fishburne as Whitey, Sean's partner, Laura Linney as Jimmy's wife, and Marcia Gay Harden as Celeste, Dave's wife. The ending of \"Mystic River\" had me a bit under whelmed the first time I saw it, and so less than twenty-four hours later I decided to go see it again and appreciate it even more. I came across wholly convinced that the film is one that lives up to expectations on multiple viewings, while managing to reveal a fair amount of small tidbits unnoticeable on first viewing.\"Mystic River\" is Clint Eastwood's most recent directorial outing, far superior to \"Blood Work,\" capturing the same insight into American life as \"American Beauty\" and containing complete, oozing remorse, something that his Oscar-winning \"Unforgiven\" had plenty of. The combination of these two primary elements is, simply put, an amazing film, and one of the best of 2003. If you only get to see a handful of movies from 2003, make sure to include this modern-day epic in your list.",

Two, it is beautifully acted.  Sean Penn (who looks more like DeNiro all the time) rules the screen.  I don't follow Penn particularly, but this is the finest performance I've ever seen from him. Laura Linney's supporting performance is excellent, as are several others. Tim Robbins, Kevin Bacon, Laurence Fishburne, and Marcia Gay Harden were adequate, though all have done better work, and their considerable talents appear to have been limited by Eastwood's direction.But Mystic River's two large pluses don't come close to outweighing its one gaping minus: the ending shows its characters to be utterly amoral.  The fate of Dave Boyle -- who, it turns out, is the most moral person in this bunch -- is tragic and completely unnecessary.  Yet Sean the cop lets it go, Jimmy's wife talks Jimmy out of his brief qualms over what he did, and Jimmy lets himself be persuaded.  All three of them seem to believe that The Horrible Incident From The Boys' Childhood somehow entitles Jimmy to do what he did to Dave, entitles Jimmy's wife and Sean to abet it, and entitles all three of them to leave Dave's wife and son in agonized limbo over his fate. Jimmy is the only one with any remorse at all ... but a good night's sleep seems to get him comfortably over it.There isn't anything to be learned from Mystic River.  There's no moral, there's no useful lesson, there's no insight into the human condition.  My tolerance for artistic expression and the portrayal of human depravity is wider than that of nearly anyone I know, but this film is repugnant.  Why did I spend my time and money to watch characters who inspire me only to protect civilization by locking them up and throwing away the key?  Why did any of the people involved in this movie spend THEIR time making it?Mystic River is scum, and dressing it up with good acting and production values doesn't make it beautiful.

The event is chilling and leaves all three going down different routes of life. Kelly (who grows to become Sean Penn) became a hood, a trouble-maker who finally got his life straight after being in and out of jail as a young adult. Paolo (who ages to become Kevin Bacon) has become a police detective who is much better with his work than he is with a personal life spinning out of control (he continuously gets strange phone calls from his wife who has left him with little explanation). Soon the three childhood friends are brought back together when Penn's oldest daughter (Emmy Rossum) is found murdered near their home in a park. Simultaneously Robbins (who is not all there mentally obviously) comes home one dark and cold night covered in blood and having a rather deep cut in the middle of his gut. Wife Marcia Gay Harden is really worried about what may have occurred. Robbins tells her a story of a botched mugging and a fearsome street-fight between himself and an unknown assailant. However news of the event never hits the papers and Harden begins to wonder if Robbins may have had something to do with the gruesome murder of Rossum. While all this happens Bacon and fellow detective Laurence Fishburne are trying to solve the case. Emotions start to run high as Penn becomes suspicious of Rossum's secret boyfriend (Tom Guiry) and Robbin's bruised hand raises more questions. Guiry, who is constantly seen around the neighborhood with his younger mute brother (Spencer Tracy Clark), has always been on Penn's short list due to Guiry's father's mysterious past. And as all this transpires Penn's wife/Rossum's stepmother/Harden's cousin (Laura Linney) tries to be the rock that the entire family desperately needs while Harden herself starts to unravel emotionally. Penn, still hanging around with miscreants Kevin Chapman, Adam Nelson and Robert Wahlberg (all brothers), begins to let anger overtake his sorrow and you wonder what is really going on in his chaotic mind. \"Mystic River\" is probably Clint Eastwood's finest film (acting or directing). He has his finger not only on the Brian Helgeland (who also adapted \"L.A. Confidential\") script, but also on the landmark performances across the board. As good as everyone is, Penn (who is on another plateau from most other actors right now in his career) and Robbins are the ones who end up making you feel very cold and tense throughout. They both give their finest performances in this intimate and emotional character study. The movie never lets up its grip and then has a surprising ending that will give you chill bumps on top of chill bumps. \"Mystic River\" never quite reached perfection with me, but its elements are something that are truly remarkable in this day of silly explosions and stupid screenplays in motion pictures. Watch for Eli Wallach in an uncredited cameo as a liquor store owner. 4.5 out of 5 stars.",

It's rare in a movie-going experience that I expect to feel immediate or emotional with what the characters go through, and the path(s) the story takes them. But something about the effect of the performances made me feel completely immersed in it, and by the end I was trembling. The murder-mystery elements in the story keep the viewer interested, however it's the dramatic elements in the storytelling and how the psychology of each character, major or supporting, is revealed that the film gains it's momentum. Each small or important emotion is played as it would in real life, and every player knows the pains that lie in their characters psyches. Penn's violent, torn Jimmy is one of his finest works in years; Bacon is better-than-usual in a role that requires his sorrow to be mostly buried; Laura Linney and Marcia Gay-Harden as Penn and Robbins' wives each hold their own unique talents. And then there's Robbins, who finds the perfect notes in Dave- the viewer is never too sure what he saw or did that late-night of Katie is murder was real because there's ghosts that perpetually cloud his mind. It's a very complex person, and since Robbins conveys him with just the right anguish, just the right subtly, that it may be one of his very best performances of his career.That such a cast could pull it off, from the script by Brian Hegeland and the direction by Clint Eastwood, is a testament to how skilled they can be. Eastwood is worthy of very high praise here, because he has to be the one to weave it all together. In his actors he knows what to get out of them, that they are far more important for the story than the actually mechanics of the story itself. By allowing the characters to give us a view of their world, we get involved more and more into the story. In a sense this gives Eastwood a chance to explore similar territory he did in Unforgiven, and overall it's just as compelling (though in a different genre). One of the best films of the year: A+",

He shared it with his wife ... and what she actually said in the movie and the ensuing seduction would then be redemptive and not just weird and yuckky as it is.The ending as is, is just a badly executed cheap shot at last minute 'shock' value which totally betrayed the movie up to that point.",

The writing around Dave isn't all that tight; the film's blunt treatment of sexual abuse is frayed and reasonable people can take issue with it. the Lady Macbeth speech at the end isn't fully set-up in the screenplay. A lot of the performances are overstated and showy, i.e. Penn's \"Is that my DAUGHTER in there?\" Eastwood's direction can feel too retrained and didactic for the film's own good. I actually agree with these criticism on the main but for all that I cannot but helped be moved by this film.I think there an alchemy at work here that the more unpolished and rough patches of the film as cinema make the emotional content of the film be even more striking and more involving. This film has life as lived quality that makes it primal and power. So sure the critic in me wants to pick at its flaw but the filmgoer in me just loves the emotional experience this film invokes. It still makes me cry.I must say Robbins and Penn are *perfect* in this as the sort of primal base emotions and characters they are playing. Robbins is so tragic in this film that he breaks my heart.This is a big part of why 2003 is the best year for film since I have been alive.",

The past is weaved into the story, leading to all kinds of blind alleys and an attempt to lead the audience to draw the wrong conclusion.  This might have worked except that the attempt was too obvious, sort of telling us that the director (Eastwood) has little respect for our intelligence. Then to find out the whole murder was just happenstance and all of the past that is introduced is actually irrelevant is annoying. . We are supposed to buy the premise of the movie that once you are traumatized you are a hopeless case and unworthy of respect, dignity, or even life.  It is kinder to just be put out of your misery.  Sort of like shooting a lame horse.  If all of this sounds like fun to you, then rent this movie and ENJOY!\n(But, just to show that I'm being fair, I will say that Eastwood's score is great.

            "content": "The nauseating accolades that this monstrous movie has received just prove that Hollywood does its job very well. Throw in some brilliant actors, clever cinematography, a melodramatic score and an iconic director, and voil\u00e0 - suspension of disbelief - of good sense - of morality itself. Perhaps it is the result of playing in too many Westerns in which there is no rule of law. Mr. Eastwood, for whom I had the greatest respect UNTIL I saw this film, seems to advocate a return to those times when we settled our differences with our guns and with impunity.I sat through the bleak, depressing story, realizing that there was going to be no \"Happy Hollywood Ending.\" But I was totally unprepared for one that completely exonerated the most foul deeds of the even more unsanitary characters. And that speech at the end by Laura Linney just served to sink the depths of the female characters to subterranean levels. Marcia Gay Harden's character, however, previously did much of the sinking when she literally put a contract out on her husband's life by telling her totally unfounded suspicions to the murdering thug played by Sean Penn. Brilliant acting notwithstanding \u0096 an accolade that is also debatable except in the case of Tim Robbins \u0096 how can a movie that validates violence, murder, selfishness, lack of responsibility and consequences, be given any awards of any kind???? What kind of society are we, if we can become so dazzled by Clint Eastwood and his chosen actors that we miss the gaping hole where the film's moral center should be???? Or rather than absence, the film's moral center is one that is so amoral that it should be equally impossible to miss. Yet miss it so many of us have done.If the intent of the movie was to shock us into outrage at the gross miscarriage of justice perpetrated at the end of the film, at the utter lack of sensitivity that the characters demonstrate towards the victims, then I would praise it as one of the best films of all time. But the message I received was not one so enlightened. And the utter horror \u0096 of the amoral message as well as of the blindness and/or acceptance of most of the public \u0096 totally undermined any redemption that might otherwise have been found in the dramatization by Tim Robbin's character of the long-lasting and wide-ranging effects of child molestation. His young friends did not protect him as a boy. They compounded this failing as adults. And we, the public, abandon him in like manner, when we honor those who would dishonor and destroy him.",

            "content": "Ugh.  What a repugnant piece of work this is-patronising and full of pretension; it feels as if Eastwood were filming Titanic in a bathtub and fancied himself James Cameron.  But that's the least of it.  Mystic River arrives on a tidal wave of prestige:  an Oscar winning director, Oscar winning screenwriter, the majority of its cast Oscar nominees and/or winners.  It's an impressive package.  The actors make a mighty effort-none more so than Laura Linney, alternately mastering and mangling a Boston dialect-but Eastwood falls on his sword, aided in part by a lacklustre screenplay contributed by Brian Helgeland.Ostensibly a character piece-at least in pace-Eastwood lacks either the confidence, skill or instinct to let go of the superficial trappings of a thriller, which this potentially searing drama most certainly is not. There are no thrills here, folks, no mystery, no suspense and the only mysticism is in the title.  This isn't a whodunit.  Eastwood makes sure of that by telegraphing the outcome through his use of obvious, clumsy symbolism. This is a human tragedy of imperfect people struggling with extraordinary circumstances; but the workings of that tragedy have to be achieved before they can be elevated to such a grand scale.  On the one hand, you could see where the story of a community of friends and relatives torn apart by random criminal acts would resonant for the director and star of-how else to put this?-westerns.  But therein lies the trouble.  The demands of dramatising a contemporary, convincing urban community in distress are far greater than the prefabricated iconography of the western.  Demands that Eastwood appears to be blissfully unaware of; Mystic River presents a directorial challenge to which he simply never rises.It's actually a little worse than that.  Eastwood demonstrates an uncertain sense of tone-and not just in his self-penned score which surely sounded better when he composed it on his Casio keyboard than it does in the cinema. Delicate, sensitive elements of this story-child abuse, abduction and murder, to name a few-are handled, mishandled or just plain overexposed to the point of verging on exploitation, mostly because he thinks this film is about the narrative as opposed to the obvious, overwhelming grief of a father who's daughter doesn't come home one night or the young boy who was left to rescue himself from his abductors-an abduction that, as staged by Eastwood, his two best friends are more or less complicit in.  (Not that this merits any investigation from the director.)  This is just one of several awkward stagings; others would include his ghastly, unnecessary overhead shot of a victim in a park that pushes the audience away from the characters and into the position of voyeurs, as well as another act of violence, later in the film that gives way to a complete white out of the screen as Eastwood misjudges the moment (or distrusts the drama) and reaches for a kind of majesty where none exists.  In fact, both scenes end in white outs-a technique that flags Eastwood's overall discomfort with this material.And what material it is.but Eastwood's adherence to genre in what emerges as an anti-thriller, stifles the potential catharsis this drama might have. He seems to understand that Mystic River is about a larger, human tragedy-hence, the portentous and superficial epic quality he applies so liberally, as if he's actually earned it-but gives into the contrivances of a thriller at every turn.  Perhaps most disappointingly, Eastwood strains to withhold from the audience the characters and circumstances-the very heart of this story-that would make it at all edifying.  This ultimately severely lessens the impact of the drama as Eastwood tries unsuccessfully to solve the crime and heighten the tragedy simultaneously-so much effort when just allowing the audience to see the characters and the action for who and what they are would've been much more compelling, allowing the audience to compose the tragedy for themselves and engage in it fully as an inevitability as opposed to some surprise plot twist.First and foremost, this is a film about men, and a rather insulting one at that considering Eastwood's narrow view of them.  In Mystic River, boys are not allowed to be boys, fathers are not allowed to be fathers because everyone-even the women-have to be like men, manly with a capital m.  This presents itself not so much as stoicism as it does broad caricature, particularly when Penn, a bad guy who in the last nineteen years has undergone a reformation of sorts, shows up around 11 o'clock in full leathers, including gloves.  Not since Olivia Newton-John in Grease has a performer made such an obvious, attention-getting entrance.  Penn invests his character, Jimmy, with a hefty humanity but Helgeland's script isn't written to Penn's strengths-ultimately, Jimmy just seems an ignorant lout despite Penn's graceful intimations that he is so much more.  One missed opportunity on a tote board of many.  Kevin Bacon and Laurence Fishburne, the homicide gumshoes on the case, give what they can but Eastwood and his screenwriter overlook the fact that even in a mystery/thriller, the drama usually rests with the investigator(s) on the case and what compels them personally to solve it.  Here, they simply move the plot along as we are asked to believe that Bacon has been carrying on a relationship for six months with his mobile phone and a disembodied pair of lips (his estranged wife that Eastwood rather inexplicably shoots from above the chin and below the nose-go figure).  It's not big and it's not clever-both this conceit and the abduction in the opening scenes feel like the kind of scenarios that work better in novels where the payoff might be bigger.  Here, they are simply unbelievable, at least as Eastwood presents them.  Robbins is strait-jacketed into a sort of homage to Boo Radley; his is, by far, the most interesting character but Eastwood is content to just indicate this character's sorrows rather than investigate them.  As is born out in the end, Robbins' character is in a completely different movie altogether and merely wanders around the sets of Mystic River, his pain and dislocation just so much red herring, played as so much bait to Eastwood's would be morality play or further Oscar mongering, a rather tasteless dramatisation of child abduction, paedophilia and murder.The women each get one opportunity a piece to audition for the part of Lady MacBeth, presumably in some future Eastwood production (or Mel Gibson's). Which is a shame really considering the women are Marcia Gay Harden and Laura Linney; one playing a  woman who thinks her husband is a murderer, the other secretly pleased at the absence of her stepdaughter, regardless of how brutal her demise.  Both are rich with possibilities, both reduced to abrupt snapshots.Ultimately, what really rankles is Eastwood's `honour among men' ending; again, reaching for some kind of majesty-fingers running amok over the Casio keyboard-Eastwood posits that men do what they have to do, blah, blah, blah, in some lame elevation of the importance of the American family above all else-truth, justice-it's the American way.  However, what one is left with-in this day and age-is that Americans, ignorant and lacking ethics, will protect their cosy way of life at any cost, no matter whose blood is flowing down the mystical or otherwise polluted river.  It couldn't end on a less empathic note.Eastwood's supporters are more than happy to do the work for him and applaud this ambitious effort but what appears on screen in Mystic River is a muddle of missed opportunities and clumsy, unchallenging storytelling; Eastwood seems assured enough but allows too much of Mystic River to fall between the cracks.Tom Guiry does impressive work as the boyfriend of the missing girl.",

            "content": "I enjoyed Mystic River on some levels- cinematography, mood, setting, score, character development. I can even go along to some degree with ploys set up to connote a modern-day Shakespearean tragedy.What I find totally implausible, however, are the numerous contrived coincidences needed to prop up the story- otherwise it falls over like a house of cards.Katie Markum meets her doom at the hands of her boyfriend's mute brother(Silent Ray) and his buddy, when she randomly encounters them the night before she's supposed to run off with the boyfriend(Brendan). Silent Ray just happens to be playing around that night with a gun that was used in a liquor store robbery years before by Brendan's father. One of the boys takes a pot shot at Katie's vehicle, causing her to drive off the road injured, and when they discover they know the girl- well naturally, she's got to die, otherwise she'd rat them out, they figure.Coincidentally, Silent Ray and Brendan's father (Just Ray) was killed by Katie's father (Jimmy) years before for ratting him out to the police and Jimmy did a two-year stretch in the pen before coming out and getting his revenge. And Katie just happened to fall in love with Brendan, the young man Jimmy dislikes because he's Just Ray's son.Now Dave (Jimmy's boyhood friend), also of the neighborhood, just happens to see Katie in a bar just before she's killed (which later sets him up as a suspect). Dave's withdrawn from being molested as a kid, but coincidentally, on the fateful night of Katie's murder, he happens to run into another molester and ends up beating him badly. Oh, the irony.Naturally, when Dave comes home with blood on his hands and relates the incident to his wife, Celeste, she becomes immediately suspicious when a news report reveals Katie's murder. This was a glaring plot contrivance.There was no groundwork laid for Celeste's suspicions, never-the-less this being a Shakespearean tragedy, suspicion outweighed the bond they'd formed since childhood and subsequent marriage.The third boyhood friend (of Jimmy and Dave)- Sean is a Boston detective and even though he rarely sees the guys anymore, he just happens (out of all the detectives in big-city Boston) to draw Katie's homicide case.We know for this story to come full circle there must be more tragedy to balance the scales. Celeste relates her suspicions to Jimmy who, in turn, kills his friend Dave just before Sean solves Katie's murder.There were other plot blunders. Even though Sean (and his partner Whitey) do bravura police work to connect Katie's murder to a 20-year-old robbery, we're then supposed to believe modern-day Boston hasn't advanced enough to unravel blood and fiber evidence at Katie's homicide scene and the scene where Dave beat up the molester.Finally, Annabeth's (Jimmy's wife) speech near the end justifying Dave's murder is absurd- unless of course, you buy into the film as fable. But since it's presented as gritty realism, the scene feels out of place. Also awkward are Sean's phone conversations with his estranged wife who calls him up but says nothing. If this is meant to draw a parallel with the mute Silent Ray, it doesn't make sense.If you recall Clint Eastwood's 1999 'True Crime', Eastwood plays a self-indulgent reporter who follows a string of clues of an old murder investigation, and is able to save the condemned man in the nick of time. Apparently, Eastwood thought that resolution was too pat and happy.So in Mystic River, the detectives solve the case just a smidgen too late to keep Jimmy from killing Dave. Here, revenge and violence are deemed honorable emotions indifferent to the suffering of innocent people. If the wrong people die, so what- at least intentions were good.The anguish worn by most of the lead characters also seems contrived, manipulating the audience into thinking they're watching something meaningful.",

            "content": "Contains Spoilers Forget about the (stupid) ending.  Even technically this film was a clunker.The Hollywood buzz about this movie is that it's gonna win a lot of Academy Awards.  The real reason behind the buzz is that (1) all the right stars are in the flick (e.g., how many degrees of separation from Kevin Bacon?  Can you get more P.C. than Penn, Robbins, and Linney?) and (2) the morally ambiguity of the film gives it that cachet of being 'intellectual,' 'edgy,' and 'pushing boundaries' (translation: the same old trash).  It all boils down to being in tune with political fashion.  P.T. Barnum was right. This film is gonna clean up at the Oscars.Okay, so I'll have to admit that the acting wasn't bad.  Problem is that there were no characters for the actors to work with.  I really didn't care about any of these folks because they had no endearing traits and and there weren't any substantial relationships between them... basically just a bunch of selfish low-lifes.  Even Sean the cop (Kevin Bacon) was basically an amoral loser.Now, liking or at least identifying with the characters builds interest in the film, but also makes us care about them, so that the emotion flows naturally out of the film.  Mr. Eastwood compensates for the lack of natural emotion by employing the typical manipulative Hollywood histrionics.  For example, we're supposed to Feel for Jimmy (Sean Penn)when he finds out that his (floozy) daughter Katie is dead.  Problem: Jimmy's a two-bit jerk of a thug with an overworked Boston accent and we've only seen him with his daughter for 5 seconds: who COULD care about him or his daughter? Solution: Have him bawling and struggling against a cadre of cops to see his daughter's corpse; swell the Operatic Music; pull the camera back and overhead to give a sense of The Enormity of his loss.  Voila!  Instant emotion!  This was just one of several examples in which the direction was so overblown I couldn't help but think that Mr. Eastwood had no concept of real emotion.Even worse than the screenplay and direction was the soundtrack. Throughout the whole film the word that kept coming to me about the music was \"incongruous\"; it basically almost never fit with the film (I guess that makes it edgy?). The final credits reveal that Mr. Eastwood, that man for all seasons, wrote the score.  I could have guessed the writer was an amateur; now I also know he was an egoist.There even seemed to be problems with continuity.  The mother of Katie's boyfriend Brendan tells her son that he's better off without her.  A couple scenes later Brendan's deaf brother apparently repeats this same comment to him and Brendan acts as if he's surprised and shocked that she said it! Also, in the climatic scene we learn the identity and motive of the killer. In the following scene, Sean gives Jimmy an entirely different motive for the killing.  Maybe I'm just dense and maybe Sean had a reason for obfuscating, but I didn't see it.  (POSSIBLE SPOILER: If the first motive was right, how did the killer track down Katie so efficiently?  If the second motive was the true one: wasn't it just too incredible a coincidence that, of all the people in Boston, the killer just HAPPENS upon that one particular person?)Of course, after Sean's conversation with Jimmy, Sean's estranged wife finally calls and talks to him--out of the blue!  Why?  Explanation: the story needed a sense of victory at that point, and since the plot itself didn't provide it, well, we'll just tack on some portable catharsis!Others who've reviewed this film liked the 'surprise' scene near the end between Penn and Laura Linney.  I thought it stank.  This Revelation about Linney's character was out of the blue.  I guess we're supposed to chalk it up to Surprise Ending.  In reality it's just bad writing: a real surprise is when, looking back, you should have and could have known, but just didn't put the pieces together, for example, _The Usual Suspects_ and _The Sixth Sense_.  This scene just had NOTHING to do with the rest of the film!**Potential SPOILER (heck, the whole film's a spoiler)** Also, Dave (Robbins) was apparently the scapegoat for all the bad things that happened in the film.  (Perhaps 'pincushion' is better?) Poor bastard. And to top it off, I just didn't give a tinker's dam about poor Dave!  He was a complete loser from start to finish: he had no redeeming qualities, his wife didn't love him and neither did his \"friends.\"  If the film is supposed to Make Us Think, it would have done more effectively if the audience actual felt a loss when Dave got it (again). **END SPOILER**The rule of thumb is that if you have a great screenplay you just MIGHT get a good film.  The bottom line on this film: THE SCREENPLAY SUCKED.  And even great direction (which it didn't have) couldn't have redeemed this film.",

In a fit of rage, he kills the pedophile but is reluctant to admit what he's done (even to his wife). Tragically, that same evening, Jimmy's (Sean Penn) daughter Katie is killed by two kids who \"just wanted to scare her.\" And Sean (Kevin Bacon), the diligent detective, has to piece this mess together.Because of Dave's reluctance to admit what he did to the pedophile and his \"odd behavior\", his wife jumps to the conclusion that he's the one who killed Katie, her only evidence being that she died the same night Dave came home with blood on his clothes and a mangled hand. Worse yet, she goes to Jimmy and informs her of her suspicions, whereupon he jumps to the conclusion she might be right and, in turn, kills Dave to exact vengeance for his daughter's death.Only when confronted by Jimmy does Dave FINALLY admit his encounter with the pedophile. Of course, in Jimmy's eyes, it's too little, too late, and he doesn't believe Dave anyway and forces him - at knife- and gunpoint - to admit what he did to Katie. Under such pressure, Dave falsely admits he killed Katie, whereupon Jimmy kills him.Didn't anyone bother to keep in mind that Dave arrived at his home with a CUT on his chest, not a bullet wound (as indicated by the evidence in the car when Sean first investigates the murder scene)? And why was Jimmy so gung ho to kill his friend Dave - someone who attended his daughter's wake for goodness' sake - using only Dave's wife's suspicions as evidence? Further, where does Annabeth's (Laura Linney) \"MacBeth\" twist come into play? Is her character so heartless that she can literally justify her husband's murder of the wrong man? Is she so self-centered and uncompassionate as to rationalize an innocent man's murder and let his mother and son live out their lives despondent over his unexplained death? Talk about poor character development.FINALLY, are we really supposed to believe Jimmy sincerely regrets his murdering the wrong man when he seems to have no problem with being allowed to get away with it by Sean, the detective? If Sean were willing to let Jimmy get away with it, why doesn't Whitey Powers (Laurence Fishburne) help bring about the proper justice by arresting Jimmy because Sean wasn't willing to arrest his childhood friend? I can't believe this movie garnered the praise and awards it did. Each and every person who helped create this mess should list it as a black mark on his/her resume! Especially Clint Eastwood - though I was never a major fan of his, my admiration of him and his work went up with UNFORGIVEN, the heart and soul of which were undeniable. Upon viewing this mess, it's dropped back down a few degrees.",

            "content": "This movie uses the topic of sexual child abuse to advance a violent and dark plot.  It never explores what really happens to the victims after the abuse is over nor what motivates the abusers.  Nor does it involve the most common kinds of child abuse cases, abuse by family members, step-parents, or close family friends.  Instead it employs a Silence-of-the-Lambs type of abduction/abuse scenario to achieve maximum melodramatic effect.  It depicts child molestation as only happening out on the street rather than in our homes.  That is, in fact, a much more disturbing reality.  If the director, Clint Eastwood, is capable to showing the fragilities of children and the permanent damage that this abuse can cause, he failed in this case.  The string of coincidences in the plot coupled with improbable dialog makes the movie a depressing and stupid exercise in depicting the darkest of human emotions.  Example: When Jimmy (Sean Penn) says he does not believe Dave's (Tim Robbins) confession that he murdered a child molester and not Jimmy's daughter, Dave never tells Jimmy where he hid the molester's body which would have proved he did not kill Jimmy's daughter, been easily checked as it was only a few blocks away and would have saved his life from Jimmy's vengeance.  This simply did not make sense.",

            "content": "MYSTIC RIVER (2003) is a prime example of NAMES counting for something at the Oscars. Clint Eastwood, Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, Kevin Bacon, Marcia Gay Harden, Laura Linney. All big names. How could a film with this star-power behind it possibly NOT get the acclaim it received? For some reason, the Academy loves the \"new\" Eastwood, the one that some time around 2000 started making these overly dramatic, sappy, preachy morality plays that Oscar voters seem to suck up in droves! Honestly, and no understatement, I think that this film is the WORST thing that Eastwood has ever done! Yep, you heard me.Eastwood's EARLY-directed stuff was much more watchable, accessible, and relatable than any of the mess he's been churning out in the 00s. Give me 'High Plains Drifter', 'The Gauntlet', 'White Hunter Black Heart', 'Tightrope', and 'A Perfect World', all much more involving, interesting and gripping Eastwood-directed movies before he became an Oscar-begger! Heck, much as I think it's overrated, 'Unforgiven' is way above this Mystic River tripe! At least it's a fairly entertaining modern-day Western with at least a few strong performances and real meaning behind it, if it does kind of preach a bit too much and possess too many boring characters. Even in 'Unforgiven', none of the characters, even the villainous and shady characters, are hate-able. They are actually made relatable to the viewer.In Mystic River, there is nary a single likable character! They all seem so full of hate and disdain that I just can't find myself connecting with any of them. Penn plays ex-and-maybe-still-sometimes gangster Jimmy Markum, whose daughter Katie (played by Emmy Rossum) was recently murdered. Called in to investigate the case is Bacon, who plays Jimmy's childhood friend Sean Devine, a detective with the Boston PD. The prime suspect is Dave Boyle (played by Best Supporting Actor winner Tim Robbins), the 3rd in the triangle of friends. As a child, Dave was snatched by a pedophile and abused for days before eventually being saved, but of course this experience scars him for life.The main thing I don't get is, based on how the adult Dave is, I don't see how it is conceivable that he could even function in society. He has a wife Celeste (played by Best Supporting Actress nominee Harden) and young son, but the way he acts makes it seems like he's been literally screwed up his entire life. When did he ever get to a mental state where he could interact, date, get married, and raise a family? This part seems implausible to me. He seems to be in an eternal state of despair and depression with a wife who seems to be amped up and wired all the time! How did these 2 unstable people even raise their kid up to the point that they did? Robbins and Harden play the roles way too over-the-top.We are supposed to sympathize with Penn's Jimmy, but I find this man absolutely despicable. He is supposedly 'stable' with a successful local business, an almost-grown daughter (Rossum) from a previous marriage, his second wife Annabeth (played by Laura Linney) and their 2 young daughters. But Jimmy has an air of pomposity and vanity that is hard to get past. When his daughter is brutally murdered, of course he first suspects Dave, as both Jimmy and Sean had a part in Dave's abuse as they stood by while the stranger snatched him when they could have done something, so he thinks this may be Dave's revenge, which raises a whole new set of questions, most of which being, why wait so long to exact revenge?! Then Jimmy, not even knowing if Dave is truly guilty, just goes on the word of Celeste, who actually comes across as more unstable than Dave! Jimmy's reaction to his daughter's demise in the park is Oscar-begging-over-emoting at it's finest by Penn, and it worked, as he won Best Actor...yikes! AND, to top it all off, after Jimmy and his cousin-goons (wrongly) kill Dave, Jimmy's wife Annabeth actually calls him a 'hero'! Can't believe the viewer is supposed to sympathize with this loser of a character.While Jimmy lacks a soul, at least Sean seems distraught and to have a conscience about it all. Lost in Penn and Robbins' theatrics is that Bacon, as Sean, actually manages to deliver a reliably accessible and believable performance. Just goes to show that it's the showy, over-the-top stuff that generally impresses Oscar voters, not the more subtle, harder-to-pull-off work. Truly, at the end of this piece, I despised Penn's character SO much that I wanted Bacon's character to snuff him out...seriously!To top all of this nonsense off, the real reason that the girl was murdered is utterly ridiculous. I almost think this film would have worked better if it were not a murder mystery, but an actual treatise on child abuse and it's long-term after-effects. Instead, we get this over-acted snoozefest. Eastwood got a Best Director nom (didn't win, thank goodness!), but what did he exactly direct? This seems more like a star vehicle, an example of when directing almost doesn't matter. Close-up after close-up, cloying music, constant preaching and monologue-ing. Terrible film.",

            "content": "Dennis Lehane's \"Mystic River\" is unquestionably flawed as a novel, with many long passages of indulgent, unnecessary, and not very good prose taking away from the detailed characters and intricate plotting. It is, therefore, a perfect novel to turn into a film, as the film could focus on the characters, story, and thematic content. In the hands of a director as great as Clint Eastwood, with a cast perfectly suited for the material, I expected more than I got from \"Mystic River\", a movie that is never boring but never becomes anything more than passable as a script. The screenplay by Brian Helgeland is completely flat and lacking in confident handling of the themes and ideas present in Lehane's novel, with Dave Boyle's character reduced to little more than a clich\u00e9, and the central theme of the character reduced to two or three unbelievably predictable scenes.\"Mystic River\" is a long movie, but it still feels rushed. Helgeland is simply poor at adapting literature, as he chooses to pack in as much of the novel's labyrinthine plot into the film, forsaking the much more important character development necessary for the plot to be interesting. Perhaps it's just me, but I would much rather see this trend of trying to be 'faithful' to a novel when adapting it by simply including as much of the plot as usual. That's not the case. I don't even care if Helgeland wrote this as a straightforward thriller, forsaking all the character development and thematic content of the novel. What he has done here is that he has written a character-centric drama with flat, uninteresting characters, and the film simply does not work as a result. It works as passable entertainment, but it is also very frustrating.I cannot fault \"Mystic River\" on a technical level. Clint Eastwood is among the best living directors, and this film is handled very well by him and his crew. Photographer Tom Stern's work is outstanding and the sound work here is also very good. Eastwood's score is certainly worth mentioning, a CD I enjoy a lot and actually listened to many times well before I saw this film. The film thankfully moves at a decent pace, keeping it from being as boring as reading Helgeland's script surely would be. The acting is excellent, although I thought Sean Penn was among the less impressive members of the cast.A film severely flawed as a result of its flat, bland screenplay, \"Mystic River\" is worth seeing if you are a fan of the cast or director, but it is certainly far from being the great film it so easily could have been.6/10",

The respective movies showed this.\"Mystic River\" deals with the metaphorical transfer of evil to the next generation. It starts when Boston friends Jimmy Markum, Sean Devine and Dave Boyle are writing their names in wet cement, and some men kidnap Dave. Many years later, after all three are grown up (played by Sean Penn, Kevin Bacon and Tim Robbins, respectively), they are still trying to get over the incident. But then tragedy strikes, and all of their assumptions about life - and possibly each other - are suddenly thrown into question.I should remind you that this is not an easy movie to watch.

            "content": "'Mystic River' is one of the year's best films and one of the main reasons of that is the performances. Like in 'Lost in Translation', what in my opinion was the year's best film (although 'Kill Bill' and 'The Lord of the Rings' came close), every actor does a perfect job in creating a character with its own emotions and therefore they could be real people.Jimmy (Sean Penn), Sean (Kevin Bacon) and Dave (Tim Robbins) were friends as kids. One day they were playing on the street and Dave is taken by two men, pretending to be police officers. For four days he is abused by the men and this terrible event has changed them all. Now they are all grown up. Jimmy has a second wife, Annabeth (Laura Linney). He has two daughters with her and an older daughter Katie (Emmy Rossum) from his previous marriage. She is found beaten and dead in a park. Dave is one of the main suspects. He is married to Celeste (Marcia Gay Harden) and has a little boy. Sean is one of the detectives put on the case. Together with Whitey Powers (Laurence Fishburne) he must solve this mystery. Another suspect is Brendan Harris (Tom Guiry). He was Katie's boyfriend and they were leaving for Vegas. Jimmy hated Brendan, we learn why that is.In a way 'Mystic River' plays like a detective movie. The plot is intriguing and we wonder what really has happened. But this movie doesn't end there. It looks further, closer to the characters and their emotions. There is suspense in dialogue between characters when they are explaining what they are feeling and what they really think. Director Clint Eastwood has made a movie with a creepy atmosphere the entire time. His direction is one of the other great things in this movie.Back to the performances. The best performance in the movie is from Tim Robbins. In every scene you feel what has happened to him as a kid. He even uses vampire movies as a metaphor to how he feels. Sean Penn has a great performance as well. He is not as good as Bill Murray in 'Lost in Translation' but comes close. Penn sometimes goes a little over the top where Murray was always perfect in character. Kevin Bacon seems to have the easiest part, but you can see the pain he constantly feels. He has a pregnant wife but she has left him. She sometimes calls him but doesn't say anything. Bacon does a great job in showing us how he feels.Smaller parts are very good as well. You forget Fishburne was playing Morpheus in 'The Matrix'-trilogy almost immediately. Marcia Gay Harden is probably the best from the supporting cast although Laura Linney, and especially her final creepy moments, comes close. Linney's performance is to small to really see how good she plays it. Tom Guiry as Brendan, who is not the best known here, surprised me in a very positive way. The more the movie develops the more he shows us how good he is.Clint Eastwood has made his second-best film after 'Unforgiven' with a great story, adapted by Brian Helgeland ('L.A. Confidential') from the book written by Dennis Lehane. Together with his own music and his actors he creates a creepy atmosphere and has the nerve to not simply play that out. Giving the characters real lives is a movie you don't see very often anymore. Eastwood does it and Penn, Robbins, Bacon, Linney, Harden, Fishburne and Guiry make sure they are believable.",

Penn's daughter all of a sudden is brutally murdered, and pretty much the entire town is questioned in regards to it. Bacon is on the investigative case (with Laurence Fishburne), while Penn has to deal with his grief and the brutal way his daughter was slain.\"He smelled like Schlitz and dentyne\" one young man says, describing his drunken father the night of the murder.

The details which go into the investigation and how this event has accepted the community indicate great care in creating an outstanding screenplay. The Mystic River setting is well photographed and the durection by Clint Eastwood absolutely solid. Marcia Gay Harden and Laura Linney are very good in supporting roles. In fact, the entire cast is uniformly excellent, with surprisingly realistic performances by the young actors playing the three characters in the opening scenes and their offspring in the present-day sequences.

Why?  Because it's VERY quiet, VERY slow and VERY long--too long.  Everything is done slowly and in almost complete silence...the effect on the audience is deadening.  When a few twists come in the final reel they carried no emotional impact--they're done in the same quiet way as the rest of the film.

Now when it comes to Tim Robbins he was just perfect for this role, he played a character that is suppose to be damaged very very well. It was just all believable all around, even if it can get a bit too melodramatic near the end. There is a lot of detective work that goes on in this and everything is so engaging with some amazing acting to the point you start to sort of feel for the characters.

            "content": "huh? I agree with about everyone that the acting was great and definitely deserved awards. But it was too easy to guess who committed the murder. And I am never good at predicting twists, but I got this one right. But the real meat of the movie has to do with the confrontation between Jimmy and Dave at the end. Those were some tense moments.Now to the spoilers: What was up with the final 15 minutes. First of all, all the people in this were nuts. But, then out of no where Jimmy's wife turns into the craziest of them all. Her husband confesses he's a cold blooded killer and all she can do is say she's glad she's the wife of a king. Well, early in the film it implied at one Jimmy was a small time hood, but when he served a short term in prison, he changed his life. It shows him running a store. He has some shady friends, but the movie does not imply he was still involved with any of that. Then his wife talks about him being a king. Like he is at the top of the criminal ladder in their community.Then, why doesn't Dave's wife want Jimmy arrested? And why does Sean not arrest Jimmy or at least Sean's partner, the only sane person in the whole film. Jimmy practically confesses he offed Dave and Just Ray, but Sean doesn't do anything. Then at the end while watching the parade, Sean mockingly shoots Jimmy, why? FINAL VERDICT: It was pretty good till the very end. The nonsense of the final 15 minutes ruined it for me. But, I recommend it just to watch the great acting performances.",

What annoyed me was the painful dialogue, it's almost like you can hear the script being read at times especially with Laurence Fishburne and Tim Robbins' overly tormented guy, and the characters are too much 'Caricature' to be believable, especially the two overly aggressive 'irish' brothers.There's also a weird sub plot with Kevin Bacon's estranged wife which makes no sense. Like why even have that in there?? It doesn't add anything to his character and gets annoying after a while. Sean Penn does his usual performance - it's good but not great, and there's a nice cameo from Eli Wallach but when that's the highlight of a film you know it's bad.",

Then there is the editing, this movie just does not flow right, I can't put my finger on it other than it is all wrong. Then the music, it reaches crescendos at the most inapropriate times and then we have a couple of blues tunes courtesy of Kyle Eastwood that should have been left in the trash bin.I was really psyched to see this movie, I had read the book and eventhough the book is not well written, the basis of the story is very good and I thought it would make a great movie, ohhh but leave to the screenwriters of this dog to screw that up, even the ending is all wrong. In the book there is a real reason about why the girl is killed, in the movie they change it to a bogus reason, read the spoiler at the end. Do yourself a favor, skip this turkey. This is 5/10 and I am being generous.SPOILERThe reason the girl is killed is because the mute brother of her boyfriend does not want his brother to marry her and leave the house since he is very attached to him, thus he kills her. In the movie they make it an accidental shooting and they top it off with an accidental beating?????????????  Talk about extreme PC towards mute people.",

Obviously that's a gross simplification, but that's the feeling I'm left with. All of the main characters and most of the supporting ones are fairly hateful disgusting people. This is bleak stuff.The one character you believe is OK, Sean, the cop, turns out in the end to have apparently protected his friend Tommy from an earlier murder charge, and seems to let him get away with a second murder of Dave, their mutual friend.Sure, most of the performances are pretty good, although Sean Penn as usual isn't entirely convincing. Watching this move up until the very end I had hope that it was going to turn out OK, but no, the credits rolled and the guilty walked free, because apparently it's OK to kill somebody that you suspect (with no real evidence) of having killed your child. So long as you act strong everything will be OK. Another child is left without a father, a wife without a husband, and there are no consequences for this. What utter tripe.A final scene or two at the end with Tommy getting arrested would have fixed this movie and made it into something great. Even him getting run over by a random passing car would have been an improvement.

            "review_title": "This River flows magnificently; a lesson in direction as a variety of raw, human emotions surface causing tensions and sensations to simmer.",
            "content": "I suppose the poster for Clint Eastwood's 2003 film Mystic River wants us to read into it in a way that pre-ordains us for the film proper. The reflections of three anonymous men catch our eye, the shimmering and disjointed figures making themselves apparent in the water as we realise, half way through the film, that the notion of looking at one's self; looking into one's self; realising that one is the way one is and must negotiate it is prominent. Such is the tone of Mystic River, a one-part detective story; one-part vigilante tale with a twist. It is a film that kick-started the sort of run of form for a contemporary era American director that had not been seen since Oliver Stone got all angry at the back end of the eighties and went on an invigorated 'spree' of pent-up film-making which saw him attack mostly everything of what America thought made it 'great'.Penned by American screenwriter Brian Helgeland, from a book of the same name written by Dennis Lehane, Mystic River is driven by Helegeland's rather deeply infused screen writing roots in working in pulpy, criminal orientated material (from 1995's Assassins to 1997's L.A. Confidential and then 1999's Payback) with his ability to pepper his scripts with distinct characters, some of whom are harder; weaker and wormier than others. It is this, combined with Eastwood's style of directing; that odd mixture of films with rich cinematography that carry a confrontational and knowing tone, as facts and situations are presented in stark but slick fashion, most of his films focusing on those given a voice when the chips are either on the way or already firmly down.One character in Mystic River wants a voice, he's looking for a way to just communicate what he went through as a young boy in 1950s Boston so as to lay to rest why it is most people think he's a little strange. He is David Boyle (Robbins), a man who grew up with fellow Boston citizens Jimmy Markum (Penn) and Sean Devine (Bacon), with each of these three taking to very different paths as they grew up: Sean is a police officer; Markum a local gangster big-shot with David sort of landing half way as a guy we're led to believe is capable of some pretty terrible things on top of the fact he himself is a victim of gross wrong-doing. Mystic River has plots going on on top of, and below, other plots. The relations characters have between one another are deep and layered, as things kick off on a number of strands, all of which carry sub-plots; character motivations and developments. The film sees Eastwood revisit ground made more famous by his Dirty Harry exploits in the exploring of the role of the vigilante as three different plights of searching for their own version of justice are juggled: a justice of a righteous nature for Devine; one of a personal nature running on love and respect for a family member for Markum and of an ill-advised nature running on hatred and prior wrong-doing for Boyle. It is Devine who captures what I think most of the characters feel most often in Mystic River: he stands on the bridge into the city following the looking at the aftermath of a car crash, gazing over the distant skyline in a rueful and knowing manner, making do with his role tackling the city's more grizzlier goings-on and a failed relationship in which a woman will not even talk to him down the phone despite calling him. The event which binds everyone and rekindles past acquaintances leading to this exploration of fate, exemplified in Boyle's rueful reminiscing as to what everything might have been like had one of the other two boys got into a makeshift police officer's car whilst they were all young, is the death of Katie Markum (Rossum); Jimmy's young daughter. Penn plays a man attempting to deal with the grief of such a loss, in doing so balancing the fact that he didn't really know her with the hunt for her killer, whom he wants before the police find him, with the close ties within his own network that threaten to fall apart: an altercation at one point with a friend and confidant named Theo is an example of how one event can ripple down into the lives of others, capturing what keeps the core of Mystic River beating \u2013 and Penn plays it wonderfully. But everything is finely distributed, the crux of Boyle's story coming out when his wife walks in on him watching a horror film and the notion of being a vampire is hit upon by Boyle as something that would see you along the lines of being \"Undead, but still sort of alive on the outside\", echoing his own predicament in life as someone who once felt alive until something terrible befell him. The use of lighting as Eastwood blots out half of Boyle's face in darkness works well given his entire arc, that notion of 'just' and 'unjust' co-existing as one.Eastwood manages to balance the respective plights of these three men brilliantly, with the grief on one stand and the searching for the truth on another whilst a pot-boiler simmers on a third level; neither one overwhelming the other nor presented as spectacle. So often now is the way, predominantly due to the influence from a number of TV detective shows, that police officers need to be exploring grandeur cases and shooting around the place under the guise of an energetic aesthetic. Eastwood substitutes this with character study and a burning tension, the likes of which are so much easier to invest in. The opening scene shows three boys and their want for names and identification to remain etched forever; Mystic River then provides a tragic story of how names may well stick but leashing one's identity is an altogether different task.",

I won't go over the plot as several other people have done that with their own reviews but this film really makes no sense.I am a big Clint Eastwood fan but did he not get anyone to watch a cut of this film before release to point out the plot holes? The motive for the murder is highly dubious and based on too many coincidences to really be believable. The characters are all highly unlikeable. Sean Penn's character is a petty thug. Tim Robbin's character seems unable to explain a simple concept to his soon-to-be killer such as \"I didn't murder your daughter I murdered a paedophile. Please don't kill me until after I prove what I have said by taking you and your ridiculous henchmen to the place where I buried his corpse in a shallow grave to show you the evidence\". Kevin Bacon's cop doesn't mind that one of his childhood friends murdered another one of his other childhood friends in a brutal error of judgement because the friend who got murdered must have had it coming after he was abducted and raped as a young boy and had turned a bit weird. Good going there Kevin (that is sarcasm by the way).I had figured out the plot twists in this film after 30 minutes and found that I was only watching to the end in order to confirm my suspicions. I did not, however, guess that the moral of this story would be that violence is OK if you have a reason and that 2 henchmen are all that is needed to take over Boston's crime scene from the location of a small corner shop. I could also not fathom if Kevin Bacon's cop is letting Sean Penn's thug off the hook indefinitely or if the finger gun pointing action during the random parade in which everyone turns up at the same spot meant that he will get him in the end because he was smiling whilst making the gesture!? Finally, Sean Penn's wife makes a random speech at the end for no apparent reason. Those old Budweiser adverts in which the protagonist shouts \"Waaassuupp???\" really loudly to his friends made more sense in 30 seconds than this film did in over 2 hours. Time not well spent.",

Bacon and Fishburne make for a terrific buddy cop duo, miles better than director Clint Eastwood's attempt with Charlie Sheen in the former's 1990 release 'The Rookie'.The conclusion does I guess go in line with what precedes it, particularly with Robbins' character, but I'm not fully convinced by who is eventually unveiled as you know what.

A naive boy that just didn't know any better. Abducted. An unresolved mystery that manifested itself into an intricately societal Massachusetts neighbourhood, where one disturbance can erupt into a multitude of hatred from the cold concrete beneath them.A father's daughter mercilessly murdered in the streets that he, and his two ex-friends, played hockey in. Anguish. Guilt. Vengeance. His childhood pals, one assigned the task of searching for the killer and the other forced into battling his own justifications for not murdering her, sending their condolences to the grieving father. Yet, Mystic River refuses to tell a simple crime drama. Eastwood, with his insatiably concise attention to the screenplay, elevated the mystery by providing an illustration of emotive complexity. One that many inflict upon themselves. Torment. These three individuals, with one visibly undergoing traumatic bewilderment, exhume indications of self-torment.Mystic River does not flow water. The elaborate dialogue is too viscous for the aqueous substance. Rather, it flows blood. Bacon's detective role combating his duties as a justice seeker, that with the liabilities of adolescent friendship. Determining the fate of neighbours within his hands. Robbins' psychologically damaged husband role, fabricating stories to protect his moral high ground. And Penn's award-winning performance as the father, embroiled in a plethora of intense emotions that express the full journey of bereavement. As separate souls, these three give life to Helgeland's script that, whilst frequently becomes overwrought with unnecessary conversations that repeat earlier information, undeniably captivates with its foundational strength in investigation building.Eastwood takes a differing approach. Instead of the classic yet saturated \"who dunnit!?\" narrative structure, he settled for displaying the mechanisms of detective fieldwork. Composing a timeline but questioning witnesses and suspects. Revisiting evidence to accurately imagine the murder as it happened. See, Mystic River works not for its \"twists\" and \"turns\" so to speak, but for its richly developed characters and constant focus on the investigation itself. The sensational performances, acute direction and gritty aesthetics provide the script with leverage. It exposes the rawness of the situation beautifully. Not to mention the exquisite pacing that made two and half hours flow by quicker than a hockey stick crashing down a raging waterfall.The conclusion should've been tighter, with Eastwood diminishing much of the staying power by unnecessarily extending its resolution. By simply ending on Jimmy and Sean coming to terms with what's just happened, it enables the shock of its ending to simmer much more violently than Linney exclaiming how everyone else is weak compared to her and her husband.So whilst not perfect, Eastwood adapts Lehane's novel with a sense of emotional urgency. Once the grit settles in, it never lets up, taking you on a roaring ride down a river of torment.",

One more thought provoking and intense film to Eastwood's credentials.Must watch. It should not be missed for it's thrill, power, suspense, tragedy and emotion.",

            "content": "Clint Eastwood did an incredible job directing this film. It captures the pain and trauma of a death that affects multiple people in different ways. The plot is less intricate than it seems but the constant mystery and suspense makes it seem as though three completely different stories are taking place at once.Jimmy Markum (Sean Penn) becomes overwhelmed with grief after a beloved family member (Emmy Rossum)is brutally murdered. He is reunited with two of his childhood friends as a result of the death. The three friends recall a terrible memory from when they were younger, that cleverly works its way into the story. It involves one of the friends, Dave Boyle (Tim Robbins), who's remembrance of the event causes him to take a desperate attempt at indirect revenge. Unfortunately, this makes him the prime suspect in the investigation of the murder. Even more, his two friends (the victim's father, and a cop) are, of course, questioning him, as well as his wife (Marcia Gay Harden). The movie subtly reminds viewers that there are somethings in life just should not occur, ever.The acting in Mystic River was incredible (Sean and Tim's Oscar), and the atmosphere created by the music and dark colors create a most mysterious and genuine tone that accents the emotions played by the actors. As the story begins to unfold, you yourself are subdued into the depths of the aftermath that continues to linger from the begin to the end of the film. Be prepared for some unexpected turns, and even if you do predict the ending, you'll still be thinking about for months.A+",

            "review_title": "Mystic River certainly is not a movie for everyone. A film about abuse and violence with no happy endings, fiction is naked, raw and eerily similar to our reality",
            "content": "Clint Eastwood's cinema has always been close to tragedy: his characters seem to operate in a cruel and apparently meaningless universe, where some endings are still inescapable. And perhaps in none of his films is this as clear as in Mystic River. Based on the novel of the same name by Dennis Lehane, Mystic River tells the story of three childhood friends - Jimmy (Penn), Sean (Bacon) and Dave - who have grown apart over the years and are brought together again due to a tragedy that happens to Jimmy, whose daughter was murdered one night under violent circumstances. Sean, now a police officer, takes on the case with his partner Whitey (Fishburne), and with each sequence we are introduced into a spiral that is intended not to tell us about what is happening on screen, but off.The film itself does not tell us about the murder of Jimmy's daughter or the abuse that Dave suffered as a child, but exactly about the period between the two events and about the consequences caused in their characters. It is difficult, but interesting to gradually unravel the complex personality of each of them. What Helgeland's script aims to do is set the stage for the next reveal. Every page is crucial, there is no synthesis, we are bathed in information at every moment, but we always stop to think about what happened in the previous scene or what happened in all those years between the abuse and the murder.Clint Eastwood is so aware of the potential controversy and fragility that the subject of his film addresses, that he is not afraid at all in trying to find the emotional discomfort of his audience to the point of shaking him in every possible emotional and psychological way, but still manage to be enchanted with what is formed on the screen. Which is arguably one of the best thrillers/police dramas of recent years, and why not one of the greats of all time.The director manages to play with the audience's emotions with great praise, Brian Helgeland's script is so good to the point of being able to build realism in the characters' dialogues and an aura almost of a dark and heavy dream, provided by the always safe Eastwood's direction completely painstakingly with the help of his longtime partner Tom Stern in photography giving this heavy, depressive and almost claustrophobic atmosphere of imprisonment in this small universe of characters covered in trauma and violence. The pace never rushes, as it knows exactly at what points to undertake to develop each piece of the detective plot that is sewn together full of intriguing mystery, and still deal with the psychological and dramatic consequences in each of the also mysterious and complex characters, but constructed in an extremely palpable way!Evil and goodness are part of the human being equally. Everything we experience, good or bad, contributes to it. Dave, a boy, spent 4 days in captivity being abused by two men, what he realized in those 4 days is that he needed to get rid of what he was so he could escape. It wouldn't make sense that Dave would have done what the script was accusing him of, since we're conditioned to believe he committed the murder. But if we draw a parallel between the real responsible and Dave himself, we observe something interesting: both did what they did with the intention of protecting someone weaker. Brendan (Guiry) is just a child, despite his 19 years, what his younger brother (Harris) has done is protect him from madness.Abuse and Murder: These are frightening words. Even more frightening is noticing the details that are present in each scene. Clint Eastwood to tell us that the man in the car that took Dave was a member of the church, simply has him turn to the boy in the back seat revealing a ring on his hand with a crucifix. But the real sadness of Sobre Meninos e Lobos lies in the character and personality of each of its characters. It is simple and shallow to say that everyone goes on with their lives normally. Dave with his son is overprotective for obvious reasons. And soon we can see the melancholy in Sean's eyes, who despite being dedicated to solving the case, as if he was in debt to Jimmy in some way; It's interesting that, despite appearing to be the most structured of the three, it is revealed to us that his wife left him pregnant, and cleverly, the film only shows us parts of his wife's face when she calls him and is mute at the same time. Phone, as if he was just imagining that moment, as if she didn't really exist.Jimmy, brilliantly played by Sean Penn, appears at first glance as a simple grocer, who seems to lead a boring life and who loves his family, but who soon proves to be an unpredictable man. And we see this when, in the preparations for his daughter's wake, he asks to see her again, and on the table where her body is lying, he swears that he will kill the one who did this. And in truth, what Jimmy was doing here was a pure and failed attempt to delay grief.It's curious to think that those people, whatever the mistakes they made, are essentially good, and at the same time they don't necessarily show it. Let's take Jimmy's wife, Annabeth (Linney), as an example of this, who is already clear that she is not Katie's (Emmy) mother at the first moment in which she appears only because of the tone with which she treats the girl's figure. And we can still mention the arrogance with which he treats Celeste (Harden) in the last minutes of the film, Dave's wife. Still, we cannot say that she is a bad person or that she deserves to go through what she is going through. Still, it would be hard to say whether or not Jimmy deserves what happened to him, for as we're shown, he's far more than a quiet grocer. The point is: something always happens, causing fate to bring the three together again, so that they return to the starting point, in this case, the street with their names.When Jimmy confronts Dave for what he supposedly did, there is a parallel montage where we simultaneously see Brendan also confronting his brother. Dave reverts back to being a boy before Jimmy while Brendan reveals himself to be a wolf with his younger brother, to the point of nearly killing him and his friend. And at the end, Jimmy tells Sean that he sometimes thinks that maybe they too got into that car when they were kids, that they're trapped in those men's basement and that everything they're living is just a figment of their imaginations, of what it would be like if one-day escape. Well, they never really escaped, their lives always return to the starting point, as has been said, and to represent this, at the end of a parade, we see the two on opposite sides. Sean makes a gun gesture at Jimmy, as if warning him that from now on, after what he did to Dave, they could never be on the same side again, and Jimmy just gestures, implying that he's not. His choice to be there is just a consequence.From a psychological point of view, we can see the relationships between boys and wolves. At first glance, it might seem that the boys and wolves of the story are already determined. However, the great asset of the film is not to fall into Manichaeism. Jimmy Marcus, even an adult and a family man, walks around with his gang spreading authoritarianism around the neighborhood like a teenager. Dave Boyle is the eternal boy trapped in the wound of childhood, but who runs from himself, his biggest wolf. Yet he finds time to be his wife's predator.And here we have another interesting topic, wives. Mystic River is, in a way, a film about men that ends up reflecting on women. Sometimes they are sensitive and smart, sometimes they are naive. Sometimes they manage to get inside their husbands' minds, sometimes they are foolish and innocent. But in the end, we find that each couple perfectly complements each other in their weaknesses and strengths; there were not just men, but couples who mirrored themselves. Boys were married to girls.Perhaps the way Eastwood reveals his true layers at the end with unexpected twists will be confused with mere manipulative narrative artifice, something that is far from being part of Clint Eastwood's storytelling technique, which he always does in a different way. Masterful. And as I said, it manipulates all the possible perceptions that we the public can have within this story and its resourcefulness, to in the end surprise us and maybe leave a void of hope inside us, that same feeling of frustration after such an unfair and unjust nightmare. Macabre. But surely the feeling of having seen a great work here is instantaneous. This is certainly not a movie for everyone. There are no happy endings, fiction is naked, raw and eerily similar to our reality. Proof of the competence and sensitivity of director Clint Eastwood, this film deserves to be seen by everyone from the perspective of life in society. A true essay on ourselves.",

            "review_title": "Terrific performances outshine the story",
            "content": "After this film was over I thought for a moment about what I had just watched because I wasn't thrilled with the way it ended. But I couldn't ignore some of the best performances of the year and it dawned on me that the conclusion of this film was unimportant. The long road this film takes to tell this compelling story is whats important. Story starts out with three boys in Boston during the 1960's who are playing in the street when one of them is taken by a couple of child molesters and abused. Now 25 years later we see what has happened to them and Dave Boyle (Tim Robbins) who was abducted is a handyman and lives in the same neighborhood. Also living in the neighborhood is Jimmy Markum (Sean Penn) who owns the corner market and he's also an ex-con and married for the second time to Annabeth (Laura Linney). The third friend is Sean Devine (Kevin Bacon) who is a homicide detective and separated from his wife. One day Jimmy's daughter Katie (Emmy Rossum) doesn't come home and later the police find her body beaten badly and shot. Sean and his partner Whitey (Laurence Fishburne) are in charge of the investigation and this reunites him with his childhood friends that he has not seen in years. Meanwhile, on the night of the murder Dave comes home very late and bloody. His wife Celeste (Marcia Gay Harden) asks him what has happened and he tells her that he was mugged and fought back and that he might have killed the assailant. Celeste doesn't see any story in the paper and after the murder of Katie she starts to think that her husband may be involved. Sean and Whitey during the investigation find out that Katie was dating a boy named Brendan Harris (Tom Guiry) and they were planning on going to Nevada. Jimmy is impatient with the police and with the help from some neighborhood thugs he starts to hear things about who the police are questioning. *****SPOILER ALERT*****Sean finds out that Dave saw Katie the night she died and upon further questions they notice the cuts on his hand. They try and talk to Celeste but she doesn't say much but they can see that she is acting odd. Jimmy finds out about Dave being a suspect and when Celeste has moved out he asks her if she thinks Dave is responsible for his daughters death. She answers \"Yes\". Sean and Whitey also find out that the bullet in Katie matches a gun owned years before by Brendan's father. This is the 24th film that Clint Eastwood has directed and he shot it in Boston which gives this a real authentic look and feel. Eastwood again shows us that as a director his films are extremely well detailed and each scene seems to have a real purpose to them. The performances in this film are what make this special and Penn and Robbins are the center of this story. Penn portrays Jimmy as a very loyal man who despite his hard upbringing remains someone who grew roots in his neighborhood. He obviously loves his neighborhood and has strong ties to it emotionally. Penn has that hardened look in his eyes and he again demonstrates why he is one of our finest actors. Penn is torn as a character in many ways. As a child watching his friend being taken away by molesters, a grieving father, and then to figure out what to do about Dave. Robbins is at the top of his craft as well. We can see that the events that happened to him have scarred him for life. In every scene that Robbins is in we can see in his eyes the pain that has remained in him. I have to admit that I didn't love this film and the way it ended has to do with it. Towards the end of the film Bacon finds out what Penn has done and instead of acting like a cop he stands there with him and they both pontificate about their youth. It doesn't exactly ring true and I do believe Bacon would have acted in a different manner. And the scene with Linney when Penn tells her what he has done is totally out of the blue. Linney was pretty quiet during the course of this film and then inexplicably she behaves like Lady Macbeth. It just comes across as weird and I thought it was the weakest scene in the film. But as I mentioned before this film is not about what happens. Its where three men who were childhood friends are now thrust together under terrible circumstances and they're loyalty is tested. Eli Wallach who was Eastwood's co-star in \"The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly\" has a small role as a liquor store owner. Its good to see Bacon in a good role and he's been in so few the last ten years or so. He really needed this part to remind everyone what a very good actor he is. Eastwood's direction is precise and deliberate and he's become a master craftsman at his trade. Even when the story falters some at the end his film is saved by some incredible performances. One of the years best films.",

You need to be in the mood for something pretty heavy as there's no 'light-relief' to be found here.All the characters play their respective parts well (Laurence Fishburne should get a special mention as he has the least character development and yet still brings more than a few nice touches to his role as supporting detective) and it was no wonder that it eventually went on to win Oscars.I won't give too much away about the plot, but I can't imagine many people will be disappointed with what they've watched.

The little gun shot with the hand at the very end and Jimmy's reaction tells you all you need to know. Devine isn't letting Jimmy away with anything. Those moaning about the dark ending, unlucky. This isn't a sugary Hollywood happy, driving into the sunset kind of film. That should have been obvious from the start. Those wondering where Annabeth's sudden burst of hard cored bitterness arose from should have watched more carefully. She's morally ambiguous throughout the whole film, never being anything more than there. Her comments at the end were her introduction to the film. Before that she was largely irrelevant and that was the intent. People say she \"turned\". How did she? She was never portrayed as being anything until the scene at the end revealed her true character. She's a Savage remember. It would appear the viewers who got this film had read the book. So that would allow the naysayers to slam the film makers for failing to create a fluent film for those who hadn't read the book. I disagree. If you're appalled by the moral tone of the film and supposedly moral characters being nothing of the sort then you won't like the book either. It's pretty much what you see. The message is clear. You should never be surprised by what people are capable of, regardless of how they may appear. That's life, that's the book and that's this film. Well done I say.8/10Niz",

Bacon is underrated and Fishburne, Harden, and Linney all holding their own. This is heavy material and not easy to deal with, but director Eastwood handles it superbly, never delving too deep into unnecessary plots and not always going for the tearjerker. This is a straightforward, thought-provoking film that takes multiple viewings to understand it all.

Basically, in the summer of 1975, in a neighbourhood in Boston, three young boys, Dave Boyle (Cameron Bowen), Jimmy Markum (Jason Kelly) and Sean Devine (Connor Paolo), are playing on the street. They write their names on the sidewalk in a square of wet concrete, when a car pulls up with two men, one pretending to be a police officer and the other a priest. After telling Dave to get into the car, the men kidnap him, hold him captive and he is abused for four days, until he escapes. Twenty-five years later, the boys have all grown, still live in Boston, but have drifted apart. Jimmy (Oscar and Golden Globe winning, and BAFTA nominated Sean Penn) is an ex-con running a convenience store; Sean (Kevin Bacon) is a detective with the Massachusetts State Police; and Dave (Oscar and Golden Globe winning, and BAFTA nominated Tim Robbins) is a blue collar worker continually haunted by his abduction. Jimmy's 19-year-old daughter Katie (Emmy Rossum) is secretly dating Brendan Harris (Tom Guiry), Jimmy despises him; they plan to run away to Las Vegas together. One night, Katie goes out night with her girlfriends but is later found murdered. Dave was one of the last to see Katie in the local bar. He comes home covered in blood with an injured hand, he claims to his wife Celeste (Oscar nominated Marcia Gay Harden) that he fought off a mugger whom he may have killed. Sean, whose pregnant wife Lauren (Tori Davis) has left him, investigates Katie's murder, with his partner, Sergeant Whitey Powers (Laurence Fishburne). Distraught and angered, Jimmy meanwhile conducts his own investigation using his neighbourhood connections. Sean discovers that the gun used to kill Katie was previously used by \"Just Ray\" Harris, the father of Katie's boyfriend, during a liquor store robbery in 1984. Harris has been missing since 1989, but Brendan feigns ignorance about Ray's gun. Whitey suspects Dave as a possible perpetrator being one of the last people to see Katie alive, and he is telling the police a different story to Celeste. Dave continues to behave strangely, which upsets Celeste, she becomes afraid he will hurt her. She eventually tells Jimmy, who was already suspicious, about Dave's behaviour and her own suspicions. After getting Dave drunk at a local bar, Jimmy and his associates follow him when he leaves. Jimmy admits to Dave that he shot \"Just Ray\", resulting in his imprisonment. Jimmy informs Dave that Celeste thinks he murdered Katie. Jimmy tells Dave he will let him live if he confesses to killing Katie. Dave admits to killing someone, but not Katie that night; he beat a child abuser to death after finding him with a child in a car. Jimmy does not believe Dave and threatens him with a knife. Threatened, Dave falsely admits to killing Katie, thinking he will be let go, but Jimmy kills him and throws his body into the Mystic River. While Dave is being killed, Brendan confronts his younger brother \"Silent Ray\" (Spencer Treat Clark) and his friend John O'Shea (Andrew Mackin) about Katie's murder. He beats them up and threatens to kill them if they do not admit their guilt. Sean and Whitey arrive in time as John takes the gun and is about to shoot Brendan. The next morning, Sean tells Jimmy that they have arrested the murderers. John and Silent Ray confessed to killing Katie; it was part of a prank gone violently wrong. Katie happened to be passing the boys, who got their hands on the gun. John aimed the gun just to scare her, but the gun accidentally fired. The car crashed and Katie got out and ran away, the boys pursued her so she would not tell anyone. Silent Ray severely beat Katie with a hockey stick, and John shot her again, killing her. Sean asks Jimmy if he has seen Dave, because he is wanted for questioning concerning another case, the murder of the abuser. A distraught Jimmy thanks Sean for finding his daughter's killers, but says, \"if only you had been a little faster.\" After apologising to his wife, Sean reunites with her and his daughter Nora. Jimmy goes to his wife, Annabeth (BAFTA nominated Laura Linney), and confesses. She comforts him and tells him he is a king and kings always make the right decision. At a town parade, Sean sees Jimmy and mimics firing a gun with his hand, to let Jimmy know he is watching him. Also starring Wishmaster's Jenny O'Hara as Esther Harris, Kevin Conway as Theo, and a cameo from Eli Wallach as Mr. Loonie. I'm not the biggest fan of Penn to be honest, but he does give a good performance as the grieving father who will do anything to find his daughter's killer, Robbins is terrific playing the haunted and constantly nervous man, Bacon does well, and there is good support from Gay Harden and Fishburne. The story is essentially three characters sharing the memory of a horrific childhood incident, brought back together by a new tragic event, I agree with critics that the film as a whole is not the most compelling, it is mainly individual scenes that stand out, but it is well written and performed, and the music by Eastwood is splendid, a worthwhile murder mystery drama. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Picture, and Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay for Brian Helgeland (A Knight's Tale, Man on Fire), it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Adapted Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama, and Best Screenplay.

            "content": "Yes, this was disappointing in a few ways. The acting was faultless, I have no problem with people the calibre of Bacon, Robbins and Penn acting their socks off (although Penn tends to overact slightly, and reminds me of Pacino in that respect).But there were many aspects which seemed pointless to me. The whole thing about Bacon's wife phoning him and saying nothing. What was that all about ? It led nowhere, and added nothing to the story, or Bacon's character. I also thought Fishburne's dialogue was cliche-ridden and predictable.\nAnd the early shot of the abductor's hand when Robbins' child character is taken into the car : a close-up of the gold ring on his finger which showed a cross. This was lingered on, as though it would be important at some later point in the movie. It wasn't.The ending was completely irrelevant - the parade scene. Complete waste of time, and it came after the natural end to the movie had come and gone. I had the feeling the movie was never going to end.***SPOILER***I had the odd feeling afterwards that the morality of the film was very dubious : Robbins' character was, after all, guilty of murder, and the movie seemed to suggest that he would have got away with it. He killed a paedophile, but he still committed murder nonetheless. The movie left a disctint impression that Penn's character was going to get away with what he'd done, and that Bacon's character didn't really have a problem with that.",

            "content": "I saw 'Mystic River' now, which my best friend loaned me. I remember that when it came out it was a widely acclaimed and successful film but I didn't go to the cinema to watch it and I never rented it or whatsoever.Having now watched the film, I don't get all the praise it gets. Maybe it's partially because it was directed by \"Blondie\" from 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' (Clint Eastwood), perhaps it's partially because Sean Penn stars in it. I don't like this person (Sean Penn) and I think he's an overrated actor.The first minutes were promising, with beautiful and awesome angles of sight of the town in takes place (Boston) and interesting sequences with the 3 main characters (Jimmy, Sean and Dave) as teenagers in 1977. They are neighbors, they are friends, they play hockey in a street and they decide to write their names on cement (which will remain marked there permanently). Dave is the only one who doesn't get to finish writing his name. When he has just written \"DA\", a car shows up and a fake man pretending to be a cop gets out, threats them for writing their names on cement and forces Dave to get in the car. Poor Dave is kept in captivity and abused by child molesters for 4 days. This traumatic experience changes him forever. You can say that he \"died\" from that day on.I was hoping that the movie would show much more with these boys as teenagers, but suddenly and all too soon it literally jumps 25 years ahead, with the boys now as adults (however looking very old for their ages) but still living in the same city. Jimmy is an ex-con running a store. Dave is a blue-collar worker. Sean is a cop.With the 3 main characters as adults, the movie eventually loses much of its interest, although it still has some lovely vistas of Boston. This is a very real story and very current, with much of \"human\" on it.Big part of the film is about the mystery behind the homicide of Jimmy's 19 year old daughter. There are a few suspects, but it's not until the very ending that the case is solved. The true criminals are 2 boys I would have never suspected.The worst thing about this movie is that Dave is brutally murdered by Jimmy. He was an innocent man who paid for a crime that he didn't commit. And he was an old friend of Jimmy! Jimmy had already a history of crime in his past anyway. And apparently Sean realizes what he did, but just lets him get away with it. Jimmy shows some guilt feeling, but he's not that devastated with what he did. And his wife even seems to support him after this! Overall, a tedious film and certainly not the \"masterpiece\" many claim it to be.",

I did not enjoy this movie, but i've thought a lot about it afterwards, and i too feel that it's a great movie. several viewers commented that sean's willingness to look the other way at dave's murder feels out of character. what do others make of the moment at the closing parade when sean looks at jimmy, points a finger like a gun and mimes pulling the trigger? is he simply referencing their childhood games or reiterating that he knows jimmy killed dave? i thought he might well be acknowledging that, sadly, he'd shortly have to come after jimmy.many viewers note the film's allusion to classic tragedy, especially macbeth, with laura linney in the role of lady macbeth. i noted also that the revenge for jimmy's murder of ray harris comes via the hand of...ray harris (he's not known as junior). to me this feels not heavy-handed but classic greek or shakespearean fate.by the way, there are not one but TWO mutes in the film: sean's estranged wife (yes i know she's not really mute, but she sure acts that way) and young ray. certainly these might represent the import of the unspoken past - especially dave's failure to confide in his wife. but i wonder if the mutes allude to some classical tragedy, and, if so, if erudite fan might fill in the reference.",

            "content": "For my money, Clint Eastwood's crowning achievement as a director, MYSTIC RIVER is his breathtaking and powerful film adaption of the equally powerful novel by Dennis Lehane that examines lost youth and other kinds of loss that sweep their way through a small Massachusetts town where everyone knows everyone. This story opens on a quiet day in Mystic River when three young boys, Jimmy, Dave, and Sean are approached by a pedophile, they force Dave into their car and he is sexually abused for several days before escaping. The story then finds these childhood friends as adults still living in the same town, though their lives have drifted away from each other somewhat. Jimmy (Sean Penn)is now a small business owner content in his 2nd marriage (Laura Linney)and raising three daughters. Dave (Tim Robbins) is also married and raising a son. Sean (Kevin Bacon) is now a Mystic River police officer whose wife left him, but likes to call him on the phone and not say anything. The three men's lives reconnect when Jimmy eldest daughter (Emmy Rossum) is brutally murdered and, as Sean investigates the crime, Dave begins to come into focus as the primary suspect. Clint Eastwood won a richly deserved Oscar for Best Director as he has incorporated rich detail in painting this intimate story of troubled small town Americana on an epic canvas and pulled remarkable performances from his hand-picked cast. Sean Penn finally won a Best Actor Oscar for his powerhouse performance and Tim Robbins' Dave earned a Supporting Actor statue. They receive rock solid support from Bacon, Linney, Marcia Gay Harden as Dave's wife, and Laurence Fishburne as Sean's partner. One of those rare and beautiful occurrences where a film turns out to be just as riveting as the book it's based on. An instant classic not to be missed.",

            "content": "How much more can one wax eloquent about one of the best book-movie adaptations ever made, Ben Affleck's works notwithstanding? Let me try.It came out in 2003. It was made by Clint Eastwood, based on the novel by Dennis Lehane, and was the first Lehane novel that was adapted for the big screen. Its debatable whether or not this is the best adaptation of a Lehane novel, but for me it has scored a 10/10, and I think Eastwood's later work never overshadowed/shot this effort (in a good way, and I've got hope, in spite of the chair). Had quite the ensemble for its time (Its been 11 years already - I feel so old): Sean Penn. Kevin Bacon. Tim Robbins. Laurence Fishburne. Laura Linney. Marcia Gay Harden. Eli Wallach, The 'Ugly' in a cameo. Penn and Robbins both won Oscars, but Eastwood was passed over for direction, and Harden for actress.Tim Robbins has never been this good, perpetually haunted, with a gleam in his eye that anyone could take to mean anything, putting him out of reckoning for the most trusted person to be around.Sean Penn, with altogether a different type of gleam in his eyes, that both conveys love, a fierce desire to protect anyone under his care, only dominated by his desire to do whatever it takes to stay ahead, and be the leader of his pack.Marcia Gay Harden - years of living with, and suffering through ignominy of being associated with scarred people has her continually simmering, and trying to do right, while being as unhinged as her character was in 'The Mist' (OK, not quite That unhinged).Laura Linney - fiercely protective of her own, yet fiercely supportive of any method employed by her own to make it in the world, her character hides her world-weariness by being tough, and staying with her own like a rock, thick-and-thin, all the way through.Kevin Bacon - our eyes, throughout the flick - these are the eyes through which the movie plays out for us (the audience), and this character's incredulity at all that unfolding both during his troubled childhood, as well as during his adult years, when abuse-reaps-more- abuse and loops back in a way that is both fatalistic and reeking of poetic justice.Laurence Fishburne - the only objective one among all of the main characters inhabiting this wonderful yet ultimately poignant tale, but the events succeed nevertheless in punching through his defenses as well.Considering how well Eastwood understands his characters, and allows them breathing space/time in each and every one of his flicks, even the lesser-known/regarded ones, and with me being a die-hard fan (not very objective, though I would like to think otherwise) of his low-key direction, I still remain surprised that he has not surpassed this work, which leads me to believe that Lehane deserves as much credit for this, if not more. Though both Scorsese and Affleck have made great works out of Lehane's books, this remains the first, and most powerful.Considering the fact that I had not read the book when the movie released might have a lot to do with how I loved everything play out, except for the ending, this packs powerful punch, like most of Eastwood's great works from behind the camera, and I'll re-read the book, and re-watch this flick to see how my perception has altered since 2003, when I watched this for the first time.",

            "content": "Since Dennis Lehane is my favorite author and I adore all of his stories, it's pretty clear that Mystic River is a film that compels me from start to finish. The story is one of my favorites of all time and is filled with intricately detailed characters full of flaws and backstory. Lehane took care in crafting all of these people so that all of them feel natural and none are completely unlikeable, but none of them come without flaws. He has a talent for making human characters and Mystic River is where this is best on display.The mystery of the film is conveyed perfectly; we are never so focused on figuring out who did it so we can be engaged in the lives of these people, but always in the back of our mind we are trying to unravel the plot. When the answer finally comes, it stuns me. Lehane's Boston roots show again as he immerses us into this city and how everything stems from the King that is Jimmy Markum. This dark, mysterious story is perfectly structured until the wrenching and painfully haunting finale. All three of these characters collide twenty-five years after an event that would destroy anyone's childhood. We see how their lives have built over the years and how each has come to be in this devastating story. Lehane's detail in this is incredible.When looking at the cast you can expect some phenomenal performances, and that's exactly what you get. Sean Penn gives one of the best of the decade in his intense and emotional portrayal of Markum. Tim Robbins also deserved his Oscar win and Kevin Bacon deserved much more critical acclaim for his subtle portrayal as the Detective trying to put all of the pieces together. An incredible, gut wrenching story that sticks with me well after the credits are through. It's Eastwood's best film by a long shot and the best film of 2003.",

How it's filmed from the get go, and the building of characters and everything they've gone through and will go through, is just great. The tragedy that spurs the investigation hits hard and deep and Sean Penn deserved the Oscar, as did Tim Robbins. Kevin Bacon and Marcia Gay Harden are great, too, with the script - unsurprisingly based on a book - superiorly directed by Clint Eastwood. The investigative aspect of the movie really drew me in, and they do a great job at sustaining curiosity to the end. The end. Ah, yes. My least favorite fifteen minutes. So very underwhelming; I don't want to give anything away, although I'm sure most people have seen this film by now, but it really was so \"meh\" to me. The scene that was absolutely torturous to watch was a speech given by Laura Linney, who plays Penn's wife, a character who was more or less mute the entire movie, suddenly has this questionably-unethical, sinister, dramatic tone that literally comes out of nowhere. I love her but it felt far too contrived, abrupt, and robotic. It sapped the ending of any emotion for me, despite the emotional rollercoaster that the movie was throughout. The only other gripe I have is that I think the murder should have been filmed toward the end, once it's revealed who did it and how, instead of summarizing it in two indifferent lines of dialogue that's shrugged off. But I imagine most people just buy into it given what they've gone through, the incredible movie that it was...up until the last 15 minutes, for me at least.",

Men turn to crime. Problems are solved by violence. Children are kidnapped and molested (by bishops, no less). Pedophiles are fully active. Children are murdered; children are murderers. Mothers are dreadful harpies. Pregnant wives run off. Men are killed by old friends. Lovers are killed by brothers. Wives suspect innocent husbands, but stand firmly behind the evil ones. Killers are punished, but not for their crimes. Killers go free, despite their crimes.For me the movie really ended when Silent Ray Harris and John O'Shea finally got sucked into this vortex. The cycle was complete. The trauma of a new generation was now fully in place. This was confirmed by the disturbed and haunted look in Dave's son's eyes as his guilty, guilty, guilty mother waves at him frantically from the sidelines of the parade. What chance does this boy have? What will happen to him is far worse than whatever happened to Dave. As Sean says needlessly at the end, \"we're all still boys locked in the cellar\".By the way, I can't say I was surprised by who dunnit. There were enough clues.

Each one is quite different, and they all work really well together. They all, more or less, feel like real people. The acting is mostly good. Kevin Bacon is great as the head detective leading the search for the murderer, but Tim Robbins is definitely the standout of the movie. He plays a much more troubled character in the movie, and he's both the most compelling character and the most compelling actor. As for Sean Penn, he's alright. I have no idea how he won an Oscar for this movie, his performance was acceptable at best. He's very bland for the entirety of the movie.

The commercials now, in time for Oscars, have him commenting about the lack of special fx's and how that truly makes the film greater than maybe Lord of the Rings.The problem is, that it has no special fx's whether it be digital or storytelling whatsoever.  It reminded me of a bad off-Broadway play that runs on a showcase contract and garners good reviews for its cast. Other than that, it has nothing special about it.  The greatest special fx to me is the story and this story is so convoluted, so built to give each actor one great scene, that I was tired, and drained and well predictably bored.I sat down with my friend and about 20 minutes into the movie, we made a list, and said, let's see how many actors get an Oscar clip scene and sure enough everyone got one. The fact of the matter is that this movie was purposely done for Oscars.  It also happens to be done for the Hollywood industry who love to be led to \"insight\" by the hand, rather than actually have to think about anything.Mystic River is far from being the best picture of 2003.

The thing that catches you is the acting proficiency of the principal actors; they took their time to study their characters, with Tim Robbins to me, being the most effective of them all.Eastwood directorial prowess is showcased in this flick; he takes you on a Journey of social decadence, the pains of betrayal and the unlikely implication of child molestation. Mystic River was shot in Boston, and it is an adaptation of the 2001 novel of the same name by Dennis Lehane. The book and movie plot is about three boys who grow up as friends in Boston, Dave (Tim Robbins), Sean (Kevin Bacon), and Jimmy (Sean Penn). While the boys were playing around in the neighbourhood street Dave was abducted by child molesters who were pretending to be police officers. After days of regular molestation Dave escapes and finds his way back home, but the trauma of the molestation messed him up emotionally and mentally making him a little unstable and hard to understand.25 years in to the future Sean has grown to become a homicide detective, Jimmy is an ex-convict who currently runs a convenience store, and Dave has a blue collar job, still haunted by his abduction. Jimmy and Dave are related by marriage, with Dave marrying Jimmy's sister.Jimmy's daughter disappears one night and her body is found brutally murdered, coincidentally Dave comes home to his wife covered in blood and rattling that he fought off a mugger and \"bashed his head into the concrete\", and possibly killed him. Sean is then assigned to investigate the murder, and the three childhood friends meet up again.Nominated for six Academy Awards, which Sean Penn won Best Actor and Tim Robbins won Best Supporting Actor (those where the two awards the movie went home with), making Mystic River the first film to win both awards since Ben-Hur in 1959.The movie also won two Golden Globe Awards for Sean Penn and Tim Robbins, in the Best Actor and Best supporting Actor category. With Penn and Robbins wining many more accolades from other not so notable awardees.Mystic River is a classic movie, that holds its own in the collation of greats, and it is one that I advice any movie lover to go buy this off the shelf.

Sean Penn, terrific in Carlito's Way, Dead Man Walking, Fast Times at Ridgemont High and The Falcon and the Snowman, won the Oscar for his performance, but it feels perfunctory. The ultimate revelation regarding who killed Penn's daughter and why is out of left field, unconvincing and anti climactic and why doesn't Tim Robbins' character confess to his boyhood chum (Penn) that he didn't kill his daughter, but rather the pederast who was assaulting a boy in a car on the same night Penn's daughter was planning to run away with her boyfriend who it turns out was fathered by Penn. Got that? The Boston accents vary, and Marcia Gay Harden carries on like a junkie looking for a fix. Mystic River, over 2 hours long, makes me wish for simple, unpretentious trash like Clint's directorial debut, Play Misty for Me with a truly classic over the top performance by Jessica Walter.",

            "content": "Mystic River, a film I have been anticipating for months, gave me more than I could have ever expected. Clint Eastwood has delivered the finest film of his career. Mystic River, a tragic, yet needed to be made film, introduces us to three childhood friends who meet with unspeakable tragedy. Set in Boston, friends Jimmy (Sean Penn) Sean (Kevin Bacon) and Dave (Tim Robbins)are confronted by two men and Dave is ultimately abducted and abused before making his escape. Their lives will never be the same again.Fast-foreward 25 years later. Sean is now a detective investigating the murder of Jimmy's daughter. Jimmy, who is now an ex-con, runs a local convenience store. Dave is now a father himself and is visibly still impacted by the events that occured 25 years earlier. The three friends, who are now estranged, are reunited as the evidence begins to unfold and Dave is considered a prime suspect in the murder. What follows is a tragic, brutal ending that will unlikely be forgotten.What I liked most about this film is that it does not give us a hollywood feel. This would not be a good film if it ended differently or the way hollywood would want it to end. Eastwood slams the audience into the lives of these men and shows us what we sometimes choose not to see, real life and how tragedy affects us. I cannot praise Eastwood enough for this film. There has been talk of oscar nominations for Mystic River. Best Picture, best director, best actor, best supporting actor, best supporting actress, best screenplay, and the list goes on. Never have I seen a cast like this. The film was excellently crafted and Eastwood has done a stellar job. This is without a doubt the best movie I have ever seen. 10/10",

            "content": "Sean Penn, Tim Robbins and Kevin Bacon are three men who have known each other since childhood in \"Mystic River,\" a 2003 film directed by Clint Eastwood and also starring Marcia Gay Harden and Laura Linney. When Jimmy, Sean, and Dave were boys, they were approached by a plainclothes policeman and admonished for writing in a cement sidewalk - the cop demands that they get into the car. One boy, Dave, does, and the two others watch the car go down the street. Dave is held in a cave-like room and repeatedly molested until he manages to escape. From then on, he goes through the motions of life, deeply disturbed, not dead and not alive. Jimmy's guilt and self-hatred drives him to live on crime's edge; and Sean, trying to make the world right, joins the police department, though his personal life is in ruins. When Jimmy's 19-year-old daughter is brutally murdered, the three men are re-united, as Sean is now a detective. The results are tragic.This is one of the most brilliantly acted, directed, and staggering films ever made; were it not for an unnecessarily-prolonged ending, I would have given it a 10. There is no doubt that, while he lacks the versatility and movie star aura of Johnny Depp, Sean Penn has emerged as one of our greatest American actors, giving an unforgettable performance of a tough guy crazed by grief. At times, as Jimmy controls his anger, we can literally feel him seething inside. A remarkable performance. And he's not alone. Tim Robbins delivers a characterization that is beyond shattering, fully capturing a man damaged in childhood. The brilliant script by Brian Helgeland doesn't have to tell we baby boomers and we Catholics what can easily be surmised - Dave came home to his family, they probably never spoke about what he endured, and he never got the help he needed. Kevin Bacon has the least showy role but he is no less wonderful as his character, Sean, tries to cope with a horrible case and his wife who has left him and now calls him but keeps silent on the phone. Like the childhood incident, her silence is a constant reminder of a life he lost. Marcia Gay Harden, as Dave's wife, is phenomenal as a confused, terrified woman who is totally unable to understand the man she married as he unravels. Laura Linney is Jimmy's wife whose character develops as the film goes along. She starts out as sweet and supportive; later, we see that she is a perfect match for Jimmy. There is no performance here that isn't Oscar-worthy. I should add - the hardest accents to do and sound believable are the New York and Boston accents. You can easily believe that every single actor in this production is Boston born and bred.Clint Eastwood has proved himself a first-class director and also a man who is attracted to tough material. The Boston atmosphere and depiction of these lower middle-class characters, from one who lived there and knows these people, is perfection, and the images he leaves us with are haunting. The problem - which is the same problem Eastwood had in \"Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil\" - is that he can't seem to end it. The film continues past several scenes that would have made stunning endings.\"Mystic River\" is a must-see. Warning: it won't leave you, not for a long, long time.",

With enough respect to Peter Jackson, I don't know how the Academy denied his Oscar that year.I don't know how Sean Penn puts so much passion in a character that's so against his type. His performance as Jimmy is not only one of the most honest performances I've ever seen, it's perhaps one of the most versatile, most contrasting one till date. His other masterful works like in Dead Man Walking or The Asassination of Richard Nixon are simply no comparison. This acting one does once in a lifetime.And, I don't know how Tim Robbins could regain such acting ability after all these years.

Anyone doubting about his abilities to produce a worthwhile picture such as \"Mystic River\", should be ordered to witness what he has accomplished in this picture.Of course, Mr. Eastwood is greatly helped by the adaptation of the original novel that Brian Helgeland has written. The Dennis Lehane book was a very deep study in what life has given the three original friends in their working class neighborhood in Boston and how they dealt with life, as they lived it.It is obvious the film belongs to Sean Penn. As Jimmy, he went to become a good for nothing, until he wakes up in jail, leaving a sick wife and small daughter behind. After he serves his time, he becomes a grocery store owner in the same area where he has spent all his life. Jimmy is dealt a severe blow when his daughter disappears. He goes to pieces as he finds out that his worst fears have materialized; all he wants then is revenge. Sean Penn's take on Jimmy goes from grief and despair, to cool planning of how to deal with his tragedy.Tim Robbins' take on Dave shows us a tormented soul who has never recuperated from his horrible childhood experience. He is a live wire who will explode at the least amount of provocation. There is a scene where Dave and Jimmy talk at the back of the house where both actors shine in it. In fact, Sean Penn seems more effective in those quiet moments than at the height of his grief.Kevin Bacon, the third friend, Sean, is now a federal investigator. His life has changed completely. He is the only one of the friends that has made something with his life. The ongoing problem with his estranged wife doesn't add anything to the story.The only weak links in this otherwise well rounded cast are the women. Annabeth, played by Laura Linney, is not convincing the way her role was written. Her last scene with Jimmy doesn't make sense. Throughout the film she has been in the background and now, at the end, we are seeing a totally changed woman. It comes too fast for the viewer to adjust to the fact that she has become a ruthless woman. Marcia Gay Harden, as Celeste, Dave's wife, is all nerves. In fact, she probably never heard that song \"Stand by your man\"... It would have made sense if she would have heard it and sang it to herself.This was a very superior film done by a very good director.",

I love reading book and essays about real life crime. It is surprising how trivial they are, how chaotic investigating can be and how large the amount of mistakes can be. That is how reality can be and actually is.I would have appreciated no prologue where viewers are \"phoned\" about who will be the sacrificial lamb in the end. It was disappointing to see how plot has been devastated trying to fit jigsaw puzzle pieces!Detectives are irritating, annoying: the black one follows his stupid clue about Dave, as Dave's wife does, just to create the plot absurd assumption that Dave is guilty. He is questioned by the police in the police station, where he asks for a Sprite and when his old friend moves to take it for him he is called the \"good\" cop and ridiculed by Dave. In that precise moment I understood that Dave was the lamb to sacrifice: he deeply deserved that destiny. He is also seen by Jimmy's \"friends\" and Jimmy automatically concludes that Dave is guilty. Why? Because Dave was abused? Dave is not a rapist, he is not a killer. Why he is suspected? A murder must have a motive.Real life detectives suspect about family, friends. Two policemen who boast of being much better of the local cops: none of them listens to the recording of the 911 call!!! I am not an expert but from my little experience as a newspaper reader, most of the occasional murderers call the emergency by themselves...And in the end the masterpiece of stupidity: Jimmy has done a tragic mistake and his wife calls him the King (because in this way she was a queen? a queen of those sleazy alleys?) The best for Jimmy would have been to kill himself, just to stop his painful, stupid and useless life: it would have been an act of grace from the scriptwriters...4/10",

            "content": "***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** Yet again, Clint Eastwood gets away with what a first-timer would be crucified for. This is not a good movie. This is not a well-made movie. This is not a deeply felt psychological thriller with resonance for all of us. This is a failed attempt by an airport paperback writer to be something bigger and better. And it is a failed attempt by a once brilliant director to regain his former glory. The emperor is naked and if this film takes a single award away from another one that deserves it, it will be a real crime.Oh, no! Is there a **SPOILER** coming up? Let me break down to you why the film falls apart. The ending. There are several viable endings this film could have had, ones that at least would have ended such underwhelming proceedings on a solid note. Instead they chose none of these endings. Okay, so Penn sold out the 'mute' kid's old man. So the kid killed Penn's daughter for revenge, right? No. Okay, so he and his suddenly psychotic little friend killed her out of the 'mute' kid's jealousy, and fear of losing his brother, right? No. The 'Mute' kid (who, thank heavens, was at least less annoying than he was in the execrable 'Unbreakable') didn't even know about Penn selling out the father, neither did the one that wanted to marry Penn's daughter, total red herring. And they didn't plan it, they happened to lie down in the middle of the street and she happened to be coming by right then. Then they accidentally shot her. Then the killing was the 'Suddenly Psycho' other friend's fault, as he attacks the kid that wanted to marry her. Then we're told that they just killed her to cover up their mistake, and THEN we're told she was beaten because the 'mute' kid happened to have a hockey stick so he beat her with it. Presumably to keep time, I suppose. And the 'mute' kid isn't mute, so says his brother, but we get absolutely no evidence of this.Let's keep going, with Marcia Gay Harden. She has been exceptional in a number of great movies, so I don't feel bad being a bit harsh here. What was she thinking? What was Brian Helgeland (whose 'Blood Work' and previous Eastwood scripts were on par with his own script for 'The Sin Eater' or 'The Order' which made 'Gigli' look coherent) thinking, or Lehane? She comes out doing every tell in the book, every indicator that no actor is supposed to even try to get away with, shouts 'My husband didn't kill anyone!' or something and then when Bacon (who rocked, by the way) says 'What?' she says 'Oh, nothing, nothing, I didn't say anything!' as if it wasn't plainly audible and then run away in diagonal patterns looking back over her shoulder and hyperventilating for 2 blocks while Bacon stands there watching her. Then in the last scene after Laura Linney has to do her Lady MacB turn Gay Harden is doing the same thing following her son, I expected to hear 'Pagliacci' on the soundtrack at that point and a slo-mo it was getting so lame.How about Tim Robbins' character? He'd rather be thought a murderer of his friend's daughter than of some anonymous perv? His wife obviously suspects him and he never just tells her what's going on? She tells Penn instead of Bacon? Fishburne is totally wasted, and though Penn is being lauded everywhere it is really an external performance. Just like the author seems not to have any idea what any of these situations actually feel like, just what they look like, he doesn't take you with him where his character is going. It is ridiculous that he is being honored for this film instead of the far superior '21 Grams' in which he is still pretty inaccessible and/or not really that deeply layered.Bacon is the only real revelation here. He at least deserves some kind of nomination and he's not going to get it.Here is the real tragedy of this one. The film has technical mistakes of the kind not found in the first year of film school. 1) a boom mic dips into the shot on a Boston street and 2) during a long dolly shot in a cemetery the front row of headstones is highly reflective and you can see the entire dolly with cameraman sitting on it. 3) how about the kids at the beginning? They flip-flop the color of their hair and name the one that looks like Sean Penn 'Sean'! Oh, and how did killing the wrong guy that had nothing to do with anything make Penn's character the king of the neighborhood? There is too much more to cover in less than a whole book.Stop pretending this is a good movie and pay attention to the ones that deserve it.This comment was deleted off the site before because somebody complained because they did not agree with it. I have reposted it without changing anything because that is a pretty cowardly thing to do. If you don't like unrelentingly negative criticism, fall in love with a filmmaker that has retained some talent; I hear Terry Gilliam's new film might actually get a theatrical release. If you don't agree with it then try to refute it. And if you don't like it, lump it.",

Would these be the actions of people emotionally scarred by a childhood attack on a friend? I guess it's difficult to imagine how something like that would affect your life, and especially if it was to a close friend, I just don't think I'd have started killing people, or become a policeman.

The correlations presented as clues to the plot were poorly placed and lacked continuity.Penn, Bacon and Robbins as three childhood buddies who went their separate ways after Robbins abduction and sexual assault and whose paths conveniently cross as a result of Penn's daughters murder is weak at best and unconvincing at worst. It's just too convenient to be coincidental. Lastly, the character of Celeste Boyle played by Marsha Gay Hardin was so annoying that you wished for a joystick to maneuver her into the path of an oncoming trash truck just to get her out of your hair.

            "content": "A movie like this will triumph or fall based on the actors and director. Luckily, they hit jackpot. It tells really two stories in one. A whodonit, and the loss of innocence. Jimmy, Sean and Dave plays around in the street. They do a small, normal prank. But a car drives up, and two \"cops\" pushes Dave in the car. He is gone for 4 days, molested, escapes. Returning to his parents, we overhear a man. \"Damaged goods\". Push on 25 odd years, and there's a murder. Jimmy's daughter, Katie. Childhood friend Sean returns to the town to investigate, and soon Dave is a suspect. He is forever marked by the childhood incident, have trust issues, and acts strange enough that he is an easy target for both Sean and Jimmy, who's the towns local mobster. Since Dave has trust issues, he holds back vital information about his wereabouts on the night of Katies murder, even to his own wife, which will get noticed. It's really a tragic story, less about the murder \"mystery\", more about how a whole town have neglected a boy who have good reasons to not be \"normal\". There's two scenes that stands out for me. The first is young Dave in the backseat with the \"cops\". The second is near the end. It's Dave again, in the backseat of a car driven by old friend Jimmy's hoodlooms. I get why many hailed Sean Penn for his portraial of Jimmy. He is a local gangster, and absolutely not a good man. But it's real heartbreak when he looses his daughter. For me, Tim Robbins is the real star as Dave. Everything in his body language and even speech tells us of a broken soul, almost still childlike when he mutters his words. Eastwood has a gift for bringuing out the best in his actors, and with this ensamble he really struck gold.",

However, Sean Penn,(Jimmy Markum) put his heart and soul deep into his character and over powered the entire picture from beginning to the very end. Kevin Bacon,(Sean Devine), played a very calm and wise detective who grew up in the Boston city area and knew most of the people, especially a young boy who was taken for an unfortunate ride in a car. Laurence Fishburne, (Sgt. Whitey Powers) was a partner with Sean Devine and they both had some real problems to solve involving a young girl and plenty of suspects. Simply loved the way this picture ended, and I applaud Clint Eastwood for great dramatic art work on the silver screen.",

Sean Penn (Jimmy is a truly Shakespearean hero) and Tim Robbins (Dave, the child who was abducted and abused) won well-deserved academy awards for their performances but the unique cast (including Kevin Bacon as the third friend, Laura Linney as Jimmy's tough wife and Marcia Gay Harden as Dave' wife) is equally great.

Just as a good book lingers in your mind long after reading it - so much so that you are almost living in the world of the book - the images and the characters linger on long after watching a good movie... Clint Eastwood, from Dennis Lehane's book, and Brian Helgeland's writing has powerfully narrated a pathos-ridden story with a very palpable emotional impact... The film, with its issues of mistaken identity and perceptions, emotional trauma and loss and a rich characterization is indeed reminiscent of the unforgettable literary characters of George Eliot, Victor Hugo and Hardy...it is a story, had they seen/read it, would have met with their unanimous approval!\nEastwood's almost documentary style and use of minimal music add to the total effect of the movie. Unlike what some people feel, the real denouement of this tale is not Dave's murder or the apprehension of the real killers of Katie, it is Sean Devine telling Jimmy about the truth - the impact of each word poignant and devastating, it is Jimmy's reaction (\"the last time I saw Dave...was 25 years ago...\"), it is Celeste's haggard appearance - having not only lost her husband, but also her son...we leave Mystic River anxiously wondering what will happen next...  What will be Celeste's redemption? Will, as Sean Devine wonders, redemption for Jimmy be to send Celeste 500$ per month? Leaving the theatre after watching a film like this, is like leaving the home of some really close friends whom you had visited that day on account of some tragedy that had befallen them and whom, before leaving, you keep on reminding, \"If there's anything I can do, let me know...\" knowing full-well that there is NOTHING that you can do...only eventuality can rectify these fatal errors...Hats off to the stellar performances by Sean Penn and Tim Robbins. They both truly deserved all the praise and awards heaped on them. I was very glad that Sean Penn, after SO many memorable performances finally got acknowledged for his oeuvre! And Tim Robbins, with that haunted look in his eyes, his awkward gait and meek stance gave one of the most memorable performances by any actor on screen... This film is a powerful reminder that we as humans often negate the line between truth and falsehood, illusion and reality, although both are so mutually exclusive. It is a reminder to us to be vary of being swayed by prejudice, just believing in how things \"appear\" than how they actually are... This is a powerful piece of filmmaking...",

I concur after having watched this film that there was good acting. In some cases excellent acting.  And the story speeds along at a nice clip..........right up to its demise.  The demise of a movie that tells a gripping dramatic tale with the set-up for a perfect twist ending, and it then reveals an unbelievable and empty conclusion.  And with the superstar cast it has, it is portrayed very well.  And I gotta say it's puzzling when a cast like this agrees to do a movie and despite the great job they do, remain stuck in a film with dire consequences of any success because of a lame story ending.  Go fish...?I hate to spoil it for you and just tell you this lame ending (if you haven't see it).  Because as I said earlier, the acting is good.  And....oh well........I'll tell it to you anyway (SPOILER).  A 17 year-old girl is murdered and it turns out a couple of punk kids killed her because they did not want her to tell on them for monkeying around with a gun.  She swerves off to the side of the road to dodge the gun-waving idiot.  The kids then beat her with a hockey stick, chasing her into the nearby woods.  They then find her and shoot her to death.  Nice, huh?  Well the story builds this mystery, making it look like Tim Robbins killed her.  And then three old friends are reunited and flashbacks of a horrible childhood experience for them.  The gangster dad then has his goons hunt for his daughter's killer. And............Can you believe it?...this great cloud of talent, of genuine portrayals, to be stuck with a bunch of farcical punks in a awkward and semi-hysterical urban homicide.  A crying shame and a waste.  Why didn't the director watch more of The Sixth Sense and take some notes?  This movie was perfect for one of those ending.  Such a waste. :-(",

Usually you get some lamers making some clich\u00e9s pretending to explain what needed no explanation because it was all too trite from the beginning. This one actually set off the old light bulb with the \"Oh THAT'S what the storyteller was trying to get at with this story!\"This story tries to make similar moral judgments about ancient ingrained traditions of morality and justice in a microcosm of 3 families that Scorcese tried to portray in Gangs of New York on the grand scale.",

Yeah, I was always gonna love this one...After the brutal murder of nineteen year old Katie, her ex-con cum businessman father Jimmy becomes reunited with childhood friends Sean, one of the detectives investigating, and Dave, one of the last people to have seen her alive. The disbanded trio are each haunted by a childhood trauma, the after-effects of which hang ominously over their shared modern horror.We begin with the aforementioned trauma, its unfolding simplistic yet harrowing. Almost before we have time to react, we find ourselves in the modern day, being introduced gradually to the grown up alternatives to the children we have just left behind, seeing their lives and what they have become. It's not long before what eventually transpire to be the highlights of the film make themselves abundantly clear: the concomitant undercurrent of darkness to every scene; the gloriously austere, subtle, almost incidental performance of Robbins; the characteristically exquisite excellence of Penn. The primary plot, that of the murder mystery, is nothing exceptionally compelling in itself, the film's appeal lying rather in those involved. The question of culpability takes a backseat, Eastwood trading the tension he could create for a wonderful depth and complexity of character which sets his film apart from the other less interesting displays of cheap fast-food-film which one despairingly finds throttling the genre. Under Eastwood's firm grip, the very fine script is guided to a perfect fulfillment of its potential, the ugly dankness of his more recent works rife within the film. The performances are nothing short of amazing, each actor bringing memorable elements to the film and not a single one of them out of step. The film's sole flaw is that Eastwood has done better. If almost anyone but he had made this, it would be career defining.Abound with astounding performances, darkness, depth, and despair, Mystic River is yet another medal of honour on the lapel that is Eastwood's career. An entertaining, if not always comfortable, viewing experience, it is not to be missed.",

I kept getting the feeling through out the film like Clnt kept saying on the set of \"Mystic River\" more acting more acting less plot less plot!I've always thought that Clint Eastwood is a fine actor, and often a fine director, too. But most of the time when he adapts books that he claims to love into movies, I'm alternating between boredom and disbelief. \"Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil\" was such a fascinating, insidious and evilly fun little story... until Eastwood got a hold of it.The story was flat, predectiable and by the end I felt \"Mystic River\" lacked something big. It was like eating a slice of cake with out the frosting. When you finally find out who murdered Jimmy's daughter (after a grueling 2 hours and 15 minutes), it's contrived, convoluted and laughable.Mystic River may not be the \"worst\" movie I've seen all year, but it certainly is the most dull, dreary and disappointing (I give it a generous C-, in case you haven't guessed).I didn't hate Mystic River - I was just incredibly disappointed by the film.",

Decades later, the men like Jimmy runs a neighborhood deli; Sean does homicide cases for the state; and Dave is battling his demons from childhood when he was abducted and tortured by two grown middle aged men. Sean and Jimmy feel guilt and pain about the time Dave was taken away. When Jimmy's 19 year old daughter, Katie, is found murdered, we see an Oscar winning performance by Sean Penn. Dave is played by Tim Robbins in an equally moving Oscar winning performance in the supporting actor category. Marcia Gay Harden earned her second Oscar nomination for supporting actress for playing Dave's long suffering wife. The end of the film has some twists and turns. Sometimes, karma takes place. Jimmy is not always the family man and has his own secrets. I wondered about Kate's funeral scene. Laura Linney does a fine job playing Jimmy's second wife. The film was directed by legendary Clint Eastwood on location in Boston. The supporting cast is excellent particularly Jenny O'Hara as Estelle Harris and Susan Willis who played Mrs. Prior.

NO! ah... i was so disappointed with clint eastwood... i thought \"unforgiven\" was amazing but i saw it more than ten years ago in korea... so maybe i should watch it again... i really tried to like \"midnight in the garden of good and evil\" since it had kevin spacey and judd law... but i couldn't... so... there you have it...",

Not many people dare to venture into making a movie that begins with tragedy and has one tragedy after another, and a tragic ending to a poignant tale.

It's a ubiquitous tale of a daughter seeking a life free from her parents, a father who buries his dreadful criminal past with the love for his family and three friends who share a dream that all of them wish never happened.It's a movie that makes you think while you watch.A brilliantly written,directed and presented movie.",

As adults their lives go in different directions, but a murder reunites them, and causes them to reflect on a shared childhood incident important in the life journey of each of the three men. It's not a bad premise for a film. But as adults, the characters and their wives are doleful, downtrodden, grungy, and generally not very interesting. Their environment is drab. The film contains little humor. And the pacing is very slow.\"Mystic River\" tries to be a character study of the three men, and a whodunit murder mystery, concurrently. But the film is overly wrought with back-story details about the characters. And the plot blends these details into the murder mystery, which results in a story that is muddled. The solution to the murder mystery is both implausible and contrived. The film's story is so convoluted that it suggests that the writer couldn't decide what to focus on, or what to cut out.The film's ending provides some interesting ironies, and has a lot to say about the issue of fate. But with a runtime of well over two hours, and all that tedious detail, the film's theme tends to get lost in the meandering and unnecessarily complex plot. It's a common problem in today's big-budget Hollywood productions.Some of the viewers who rate \"Mystic River\" so highly may be basing their evaluations on hype, generated from the big name cast, Eastwood as Director, and promotional considerations. The inherent merits, and demerits, of this film suggest to me that it is mediocre, at best.",

Really is it a murder mystery with self righteous overtones. Actually as a murder mystery it was quite entertaining but really it was building towards a profound ending. That on reflection wasn't very profound at all.I'm pretty certain that a film doesn't have to be entertaining as far as Penn is concerned. Yet no matter how meaningful a film tries to be the medium is not suited to this purpose. Read a book methinks. A film is the wrong viechle, so why bother to make it in the first place? One suspects it is probably so everyone can pat themselves on the back and feel superior.

            "content": "Terrible, Terrible movie. I still don't see a point to it. Sure, the characters are developed well.....but they are developed towards the most ridiculous plot I've witnessed in a movie to date. The story itself as a mystery is satisfying to start, but in efforts to effect emotion in the viewer, is taken to absurd levels. Many argue that the acting is believable, I think its so overdone that it can't be taken seriously, especially if you keep in mind the ludicrous nature of the plot. Sean Penn is once again lauded by many, in a violent role that is apparently also supposed to show angst and feelings of being torn, he instead in my opinion comes across as an irrational person. The only acting job worth commending is that of Robbins, who plays his character to perfection. Out of any in the cast, he definitely comes the closest to a real performance.Clint Eastwood was given praise for his directorial work, which, given the intentions of the film, is also unworthy. It seems that the actors live in their own little worlds.....from what i've read, apparently this is because it makes the viewer more involved in the story....but really, it doesn't.My major gripe with this movie is this: it doesn't achieve its goal. I don't complain if I know the movie is aiming low beforehand, and fulfills those expectations. Mystic River is promoted and talked about as an intellectual, dramatic work, with some kind of emotion to be drawn from it in the end. In reality, I was treated to absurdity.Don't waste your time:D-",

            "review_title": "Drama with a capital D",
            "content": "In today's cinema, there are dramas and there are Dramas. A drama is often not much more than a generic term used to designate a movie which doesn't suit in any other category. For the general public, the definition for drama is so much innate that it becomes almost impossible to give it. Instead, a Drama is a movie that catches the viewer in his/her deepest depths at the point that he/she feels exactly the same feelings and the same emotions than the characters portrayed on screen. And \"Mystic River\" is a Drama.Directed by Clint Eastwood, \"Mystic River\" tells the reunion of three childhood friends in less-than-enjoyable circumstances. The movie begins in a street from a residential neighborhood in Boston at the end of the '70s. Jimmy, Sean and Dave are playing street hockey when they decide to write their names in a part of sidewalk whose cement hasn't dried yet. However, they're caught by \"policemen\" and the latter bring Dave with them.Cut to present day. Jimmy (Sean Penn) is an ex-convict, owner of a small store and father of three children. Sean (Kevin Bacon) is a divorced homicide detective. Dave (Tim Robbins), whose life dramatically changed since the car event, lives peacefully with his wife and his son.Jimmy's oldest daughter Katie (Emmy Rossum) has been found murdered in a park. Sean is assigned to the case and his relationship with Jimmy is a factor that stimulates him even more in this sordid affair. Dave is also sympathetic to Jimmy, but several clues picked up by Sean and his partner Whitey (played by Laurence Fishburne) start to make believe that Dave could actually be a prime suspect in that affair.The movie lays on a solid story, immaculate direction, but especially on the strength of its three main actors. Talking about that, two of them (Penn and Robbins) received an Oscar each for their performance in the film. Penn is a society rebel, shown by the sidewalk episode and his two years in jail, but he also has a heart and the sadness and the revolt that he shows after his daughter's murder are sincere.Bacon does his job very professionally, but he's not insensitive to the fact that the murder he's investigating concerns his childhood friend. And just like Jimmy who's bruised by the murder of his daughter, Sean also has to come to terms with his own divorce.Robbins is the most fascinating of the three. He had the bad luck of being the one taken in that car and this traumatic event is well-reflected in his face. Very often, he looks more like a beaten dog rather than a middle-aged man. Even if he's imposing physically speaking, he remains nevertheless the weakest character among those we see on the screen.The story of \"Mystic River\" is adapted from the novel of the same name by Dennis Lehane. Such a story is unusual for a filmmaker like Clint Eastwood. And yet, it's probably his best non-Western film as a director. It all demonstrates that Eastwood is a film virtuoso, should he be in front of or behind the camera.Even if the story is originally from Lehane, screenwriter Brian Helgeland must be credited for his faithful and skilfully successful adaptation.The movie immaculately shows how one single event can affect so many people and, at the same time, how this event can reunite people. The story is terribly realistic and shows the fragility of child life and never attempts to restrain the impact of pedophiles on youngsters. It's very courageous from Eastwood's part.Add to that an explosive, merely believable climax and you'll obtain a strikingly poetic and tragic, almost Shakespearian taste.Eventually, the good old question \"what if?\" comes to the major characters. It's obviously a unanswerable philosophical question, but it still refers to that painful day when everything changed for three boys who were innocently playing street hockey...\"Mystic River\" makes a very good development from a simple story that will finally last for over two hours.As for the mystery of the murder of Jimmy's daughter, the investigation is imaginative and suspenseful and, as for every good mystery story, the revelation of the guilty is surprising.But we don't fairly get interested to \"whodunit\" when we see the pain and the emotions of the characters. Especially the male ones. It's good to see men sharing their emotions. It's yet surprising from a director like Eastwood, who had mainly worked on macho films during the major part of his career.\"Mystic River\" is an eloquent example of how the past can affect a life in the present. It's also a very courageous film about pedophilia towards young boys.",

In my opinion, Sean Penn's performance was mediocre and very artificial. Actually, I think he didn't deserve the Oscar he grabbed! The real hero of this movie was Tim Robbins; such a complicated character and such an amazing performance! Boyle is a vivid example of a man motivated by fear and living in his own world of dreams; all because of a horrible tragedy he has been subjected to as a child. This tragedy plays the role of the ghost that haunts the characters throughout their lives. Some are haunted by fear, others by guilt and deception. Laura Linney and Marcia Gay Harden did a wonderful job, but I think their characters needed more elaboration to justify their deeds. As for Kevin Bacon, he simply had what it takes!",

Something bad happens to someone and they become a victim. That victim grows up and something worse happens and now the victim is the suspect but no one knows the true heroic deeds and nature of the once victim until its too late.The film stars Kevin Bacon, Sean Penn and Tim Robbins. They were childhood friends and something horrific happens and the grow up and grown apart. Years later, as adults, they all have different roles. Sean Penn is now the neighborhood go to guy who is a little shady but nothing to serious. Yet everyone knows that he is the guy you can rely on to solve neighborhood disputes. Tim Robbins is now the strange guy that people avoid but are cordial to when they see him on the streets. No one wants to talk to him (as he was once a victim himself as a child). He is married to Marcia Gay Harden who loves him (but not unconditionally) and is a little unease by him. Kevin Bacon is now a detective and has been completely removed from the scene, but an event happens that brings him back in touch with his old childhood friends.So tragedy strikes and it becomes a race between street justice and official justice. People become short-tempered. They want to know, right now who did it. They do not want to wait for an official investigation so they start their own. The problem with street justice is that it doesn't require any evidence, just suspicion and like all Shakespearean tragedies a little bit of information becomes an extremely dangerous thing. Lots of little things play out, like the disloyalty of one wife, another wife egging her husband on ala Lady McBeth. Daughters not permitting to date into certain families ala Romeo and Juliet. And in the end, everyone change and none of it for the better. Jealousy is a hungry goddess and in this film, it is feed a lot and is the main culprit. Plus it's interesting on how the mind would take a single nugget of info and totally self-destruct and turn something that isn't true, into fact. And once your mind is set to that something is a fact then the truth sounds like a lie.This is a film worthy to watch and it leads to discussion. The film is dark; there is no joy in it, but its great to see how things can spiral out of control. Tragedy muddles the mind and everyone's mind is muddle in this film. I give this film a 7 out of 10. You have seen this before, although this film does a great job of it, but it's not a film that will amaze you. And 7 is a great rating for a simple drama.",

This movie tries to replicate a book and for me it was not an enjoyable movie. It was however expertly acted.As always when focusing on the mature themes of the movie you have to be very delicate in handling this subject matter. The movie continues like so many other mob shows like the Godfather, Sopranos & The Goodfellas in glamorising the Mafia.Despite my dislike of this aspect of the story I am glad that I watched the film.",

            "content": "On the whole, Mystic River is a lot like Sean Penn's Oscar winning performance in the film.  At times it is brilliant, meticulously crafted, restrained and understated - tearing at the heartstrings of viewers, simultaneously inspiring empathy and repulsion.  At other times, it is overblown, overdone, overwritten, overplayed, ham-handed, difficult to buy, contrived and silly.  On the rarest of occasions, it's confusing (not the plot, which attempts to spellbind, but the relevance of certain characters, scenes and unintentional laughs.)  Before I saw this film, I heard that Sean Penn would be attending his first Oscar ceremony to \"support Mystic River\" and I witnessed Tim Robbins' wife (or girlfriend? I can proudly say I don't know) Susan Sarandon stress the social relevance and importance of the film, and vaguely alluding to her belief that it was more deserving of a \"special effects thing movie\" like the UTTERLY GODLIKE AND BENEVOLENT Lord of the Rings: Return of the King.  LOTR: ROTK features everything that makes a movie great, except for great acting.  Mystic River is sort of the opposite: the only thing that makes it a good movie are the consummate performances of Oscar winners Tim Robbins and Sean Penn.  I enjoyed this movie for the acting, so I won't go into much detail about how I found these two performance flawed, they are nearly flawless.  Marcia Gay Harden is pitiful - she's playing dumb, but it comes out retarded.  Laura Linney, who nabbed a Best Actress nomination, for some reason, is just as bad.  Kevin Bacon and Lawrence Fishburne have somehow channeled Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy from 48 Hrs.  The dialogue is stilted at times - hearing an otherwise good actor like Fishburne talk about how \"you can tell he's done time - they carry it in the shoulders\" is just awkward and uncomfortable.  There are certain scenes that recall the polished, just-the-facts ma'am quality of Helgeland's work on L.A. Confidential, but his script is immensely flawed, and this bungles some of the performances - the characters are generally underwritten.  The movie has too much unnecessary dialogue, The Mrs. Devine subplot is utterly pointless, the film lacks a strong female character, and the strong male characters are too strong.  The emotions secrete from these actors in brief, pained bursts.  The film is restrained, but in a bad way. The subplot of the daughter going to Vegas with her boyfriend helps explain the ending (this isn't a spoiler, don't worry) but there's no explanation for why she's leaving.  The climax (where \"all is explained\") feels scattershot and tacked on.  The question remains, why is all this socially relevant?  Has this story never been told before?  A lot of critics think the film has a message about the patterns of violence and sexual abuse, passed down from generation to generation.  This WOULD be the case, had Helgeland included in his screenplay the notion from Lehane's novel of Danny Boyle becoming a child molester as a result of his own sexual abuse - an essential part of the story, that would make it more difficult for us to feel sorry for Robbins.  Is ALL of the violence in this movie portrayed as completely pointless and unfair?  Yes - that isn't the case in real life. The worst offender, I'm afraid to say, is Clint Eastwood.  His direction is actually quite good in a technical sense, but his camera moves too much, and pleads with the viewer to understand how tense he wants him or her to feel. His score is decent (I use that term sparingly,) but certain moments are definitely given terrible cues.  The film's 137 minutes feels a bit shorter, and that's a plus, but I'm not sure it knows what it wants to be?  There's too much going on here for it to have a real message - it's just a good mystery.  It's not important or relevant because it doesn't offer a conclusion to the film's hypothesis.",

The whole movie is centered around the murder of the daughter of one those three boys, who grew old now. Eastwood did a good job of portraying and hence building the suspense around the movie. Performances are the biggest assets of this movie. Sean Penn as Jimmy Markum, the father of the murdered daughter was really good. He is excellent in both emotional and the intense climax scenes. Kevin Bacon, as Sean Devine, another boy amongst those three, did a good job as the investigating officer. But it was Tim Robbins as Dave Boyle, the boy to whom that actual event occurred and which changed his entire life drastically, gives the most powerful performance.Notwithstanding those performances, the thing which maybe termed as the 'loose end' is the climax and the motive of the murder.

            "content": "Very rarely does Clint Eastwood deliver a product that is not up to the mark or below average. 'Mystic River' is definitely not one; in fact it is one of his bests ever. In Mystic River he tries to explore how incidents in our childhood affect our lives in a big way, in fact they probably shape our destiny. ( I am sure this was intended - The starting scene where the three kids are embossing their names on a freshly cemented pavement, just before Tim is picked up by the padeophile, is conveying the above message. Later On, a grown up Tim sees the same pavement, with the partially completed names, once again. Surely God is in the details...bravo !! CLINT...bravo!!)The story is that of three boys growing up in the same neighbourhood. One of them suffers at the hands of a paedophile. He grows up to become a slightly mentally disturbed, lost guy played amazingly well by Tim Robbins. His other two friends become a local don (again played beautifully by Sean Penn) and one a homicide detective (Kevin Bacon). Sean's teenage daughter is murdered and thenstarts a whodunits chase. Both Sean and Kevin want to catch the culprit first. The former wants to seek revenge and the latter to seek justice. Tim's role in the murder is not ruled out as he was in the same bar as the girl just prior to the murder.The movie is simply amazing to watch for its sheer intensity of acting by Sean and Tim. This is probably Tim's second best performance ever after 'The Shawshank Redemption'. Excellent direction by Clint leaves the audience at the edge of their seats for almost the entire duration of the movie. I will not ruin your suspense by telling you the end.It is a must watch for the Clint Eastwood and Thriller fans.",

So Before I watched it I looked it up and saw that Bacon , Penn and Robbins were in this film. and I have seen the three of them in previous films - I saw Bacon in Tremors. Saw Penn in Fast times at Ridgemount High and I am Sam. Robbins in an OUTSTANDINGLY Masterpiece The Shawshank Redemption , Bull Durham and yes I saw him in even Howard The Duck. So I kinda could tell from the 3 actors that this film should be alright at least. AND Clint Eastwood Directed it !!So let me talk about the movie. The movie is about these 3 friends that grow up with one of them kidnapped and abused then he escapes and years later one of thems daughter gets murdered and gets even worse. So its Bacon who tries to fit this altogether. As acting wise I felt Bacon was good but a little bit reserved but he was needed that way. Penn was Great in the his part he looks it AND You feel for his pain , suffering and want for redemption. Last Robbins is this guy who gets abused when he was a kid and that never leaves his head and effects him and changes him . HE also did a great job with his role were I felt kinda bad / kinda sad /kinda angry at him and more feelings towards him. Also Eastwood directs this movies. Is it a masterpiece ? With me just seeing it once at this point I would say NO - however I might say that it is someday . I feel like there was a lot to this movie and everything did not click into my brain watching it once. Other Then Katie being Killed. The 3 guys go through quite a bit of feelings I liked it because they all did a good job with everything.I feel like I missed the whole thing with the Deaf kid and his friend. Like I guess I just did not think much of them till the end. So that part I would need to see again. Also I thought by the way you see Katies dead body when Bacons character Sean first see's it - I thought that was tough to watch and also I almost cried when Jimmy ( Penn) was fighting as hard as possible to get through to see his daughter. ~ This movie is when you want to watch something deep and unpredictable and dark. My opinion is its truthfully about Dave ( T.R.) his character is abused and Mental and confused and awfully feeling and hurt and vulnerable. He is a better person then Jimmy in my opinion. He just needed help or counseling. (Robbins did great as Dave ) - Also like a lot of people on here said already Scenery was amazing - I felt like I was in Boston neighborhood with three guys who are going through emotional and psychological conflicts. All in All Great Movie with Emotions and Soul and Temptation. Dark and Powerful with Astonishing Performances from Penn and Robbins and a SWELL one from Bacon. Watch this movie at least once. I know I will watch this movie again in the future to fully grasp the Mystic River.",

Then, for no known reason, Clint Eastwood cancelled and we were left to wait another six months for the film to be released nationwide. Was it worth the wait? Well, while I've never doubted Eastwood's talents behind the camera (I really liked Absolute Power) there is just something in this film that fails to connect with me. The story of three childhood friends (Penn, Robbins, Bacon) torn apart as adults after one of them is abducted is intriguing. Penn is the thug father with a loathsome and heartless wife (Laura Linney), Robbin's is the meek and humble dad with a loving (but totally traitor) wife (Marcia Gay Harden) and Bacon is the investigating Cop who's wife has run away. All of them perform very well, especially Robbin's who has always struggled to shed his 'nice but dim' typecasting. And Eastwood's direction takes its time and builds the story at a deliberate, unrushed pace.But as soon as Sean Penn's daughter is murdered I lost all sympathy for them. The story falls into darkness as suspicions and tensions mount. Every character gets what they deserve. I had no connection with Marcia Gay Harden at all and her panic and denial at the end is her own fault. Her character was the wife of Tim Robbins' for what appears to be over a decade, she simply would have known her husband wasn't a killer, should never have confided in Sean Penn. Tim Robbins is also to blame for telling lies about how he came home bleeding and shaken.Sean Penn's character also gets what's coming to him (though it's a bit of a let-down we don't actually see it). He's a bad man and despite his brilliant acting and grief at the loss of his daughter, why on earth would I care about such a despicable man? Basically, many horrors and tragedies could have been avoided in this story if people just told the truth. Fair enough, there wouldn't BE a story if that were so but the result is a film that I cannot engage with and in the end I just don't care.The DVD is in great-looking 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen with Dolby 5.1 sound. There are 2 extra discs worth of features (one of them is a soundtrack CD) if you can't get enough. I've had my share of this movie. It may have much greatness to it, but I want no more.",

Interestingly enough, his two childhood friends Sean (Kevin Bacon) and Dave (Tim Robbins) are both very much involved in the case. Sean is a state policeman investigating the crime with his partner Morpheous...I mean Whitey (Laurence Fishburne). And Dave is one of the prime suspects. The true wonder of this movie isn't really the plot, but the performances. Penn, Robbins, Bacon and Marcia Gay Harden (who plays Dave's wife, Celeste) are all fine actors that really make watching this movie fun. Most notably Harden's portrayal of a wife that is torn between her loyalty to her husband and her duty as a citizen to uphold the law. The movie has a great beginning and a fine ending. But the middle is a bit sloppy. It could have used some better editing to make the middle of the movie more taut. Other than that, the movie is pretty good. The mystery of who killed Jimmy's daughter is intriguing, but really makes for a tense thriller toward the 3rd act. People and critics are saying that this is the best movie of 2003. I don't really get that. It's a good movie. Just not a great movie. It isn't as good as some of my favorites of 2003, such as MATCHSTICK MEN or WHALE RIDER. Or even some of the popcorn flicks like PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN. But still, I recommend this. See it if just for the performances.RATING: *** out of ****",

And is Dave even really the killer, or is he telling the truth about the mugger? (If you're confused, just watch. It makes more sense.)Sean Penn is always walking a fine line with me, but he is excellent in this film. More mob roles should be in his future and less military roles. Kevin Bacon is Kevin Bacon, which for me is a good thing. Tim Robbins excels. He has always been great, but this time he really outdoes himself.Watch three lives come together and slowly get torn apart. It's gritty, it's real and it's amazing. A special shout-out to Emmy Rossum who was great and should be in more big films (but probably won't be), and Laura Linney who is always great. After \"Kinsey\" and \"Life of David Gale\", it's nice to see her in something less erotic.Rent this film... don't be fooled by the title, it has nothing to do with \"Mystic Pizza\".",

            "content": "This Clint Eastwood directed film, 'Mystic River', is based on the brilliant novel by Dennis Lehane. The word 'stunning' gets overused but the performances by the cast were little short of that. Sean Penn and Tim Robbins deserved their Oscars; Kevin Bacon and Laurence Fishburne; Marcia Gay Harden and Laura Linney; and a knockout range of fine American actors prove again how deep is the talent in the American movie business. Eastwood's no nonsense direction pushed the narrative along with concision and craftsmanship; he is a master of the subtle 'who did what' drama, such as this, and I bet it came in under budget and on time. (IBDM says $25m budget, box office $157m). My wife and I were gripped by this story of a generation growing up and coalescing later in a Boston suburb. The real Mystic River is seven miles long. It lies to the north of Boston and flows approximately parallel to the lower portions of the Charles River. It flows from the Lower Mystic Lake and travels through the Boston-area communities of Arlington, Medford, Somerville, Everett, Charlestown, Chelsea, and East Boston. The river joins the Charles River to form inner Boston Harbor. And that brought me to Robert Lowell and his Charles River poem, for no good reason other than the sheer quality of the original book, this film and that wonderful poem... All three are superb.",

I normally don't watch many dramas but lately I've been trying to catch up on this genre and in particular award-winning films of recent years.This movie grabs you right from the beginning. It is amazingly efficient in creating an atmosphere and establishing the main characters and their feelings surrounding an event that occurred when they were young. It is engaging the whole way through and it generally focuses on the emotions of the characters and situations rather than technical plot developments and exposition. It's about the why as opposed to the how, when, what, where and who. That's not to say there isn't any mystery - there is plenty.What really seemed to make the movie work was the acting. All the main actors were great. The performances brought the characters to life and their emotions for the most part felt real. The movie explored ideas I had not really seen before in a movie and I found these very interesting.Most importantly for me, the movie was very engaging and rewarding. It was far from predictable or clich\u00e9d and explored some very interesting and intense ideas and emotions. Everything is held together by the excellent directing and solid script. I liked the music a lot as well and was very surprised to find out Clint Eastwood composed it himself!",

I mean movies are supposed to entertain, keep us thinking, leave us on the edge of our seat.. but none of that here... How can the producer/director just end the movie and let us think what would have happened.. the script writer is supposed to come up with the ending and the producer needs to show it to us... if we are the ones left to do it, then why are those guys sitting there.Lots of reviewers have already written about the illogical plot and the series of events that prove the statement.. I suggest you also take a look at that... it's almost.. well.. funny! Yeah, that's right funny, laugh about it..So the bottom line is that this is not a movie that the smart ones will enjoy... the smart ones need a movie that is skillful and challenges the wits..

I haven't read the novel but have heard that it is great too. Talking about acting,that is top-notch. Our three lead actors are really good especially Sean And Tim They deserved the academy award. The locations are really good and the scene when everything unravels (when Jimmy shoots Dave )is chilling. On the other hand,it was a bit predictable about Dave not being the killer,anyhow they managed to keep the suspense about the real one. This movie is just not about murdered girl of Jimmy but about the characters and their life after the incident which effected the great deal of their childhood. As Dave was cited as 'damaged goods' ,Jimmy ran a illegal crew and it made Sean detective. How the confusion,mental instability ,lying of one character changes his fate and how his wife takes him as someone else . Some people will hate the scene where Boyle get killed for what he did not do by his childhood friend but this isn't about the justice. IT is about the tension,word of mouth,rumors and how things looked to either character which made him do the worst thing he could ever imagine to his friend.This facts makes this movie better and non-clich\u00e9d.

The plot is great; it shows how deeply peoples actions can affect each other, even over many years, actions they thought would make little to no difference for their future. The acting is all great; Sean Penn is amazing, and the other actors are all great too, especially the actors who portray the main characters. The cinematography is great. The story is captivating, it gets your attention and keeps it, for every single scene of the movie, in it's 2 hour 15 minutes runtime. This is a great emotional drama, topped off with an exciting criminal mystery that keeps you guessing the final outcome of the movie for the entire time. I never lost interest in the movie. I doubt that it could have been a lot better, the only thing I didn't really like about it was one scene at the very end, in which a character gives a long monologue, that neither I, nor the two people I saw the movie with, could make very good sense of. Apart from that, it was nearly perfect. I'd recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good drama or an interesting criminal mystery. It's worth watching. 8/10",

            "content": "Mystic River is not the movie you want to be watching just to kill a few hours. Clint Eastwood's 2003 film is a somber, heartbreaking look at the lives of three men who couldn't escape their childhood. Jimmy (Sean Penn, in an Oscar award winning role for best actor), Sean (Kevin Bacon), and David (Tim Robbins in his Oscar award winning role for best supporting actor) grew up in the same working class neighborhood, living the normal lives of kids playing in the street, until one day when David is taken away by a man who says he's a cop. From then on, all three boys, and later all three men are different, they can never escape their childhood. David was sexually abused by the man who took him away, and the older version of David is a social outcast, Tim Robbins does a remarkable job of showing people there is something wrong with him. Eastwood could have eliminated the first 10 minutes of the movie where the back story is told and audiences would have no problem figuring out that David had something done to him. Jimmy (Penn) has grown up in the same neighborhood to become owner of a corner store with 3 children to his late wife. Remarried, the movie shows Jimmy readying for his youngest daughter's first communion when we find out his daughter was murdered. One of the police detectives on the case is Sean (Bacon) who vows to find the killer of his childhood friend's daughter. Sean and his partner, played by Lawrence Fishburn, begins to investigate whether David was somehow involved. The rest of the movie plays as a who-dunnit with heavy doses of heartbreaking characters. All of the characters are flawed, no one is ever innocent in Mystic River. The conclusion is tough, by the end, there is no one to really root for. David comes across as pathetic, but sympathetically so. Jimmy is a caring father who wants justice, but his own past may catch up with him. And Sean? He's just trying to solve a mystery while trying to forget his past. Eastwood takes his time, setting up various characters and their characteristics. One of the underlying symbols to Mystic River is that anytime someone gets into a car, something bad happens. It happens throughout most of the movie. Mystic River reminds the viewer that every time they get into a car, the odds of dying are higher than when on an airplane. The dark, moody look to Mystic River, shot entirely in Boston (not Vancouver, horray!) is uneasy and furthers the despair we see in the characters. So many flawed characters, such a heartbreaking story.",

Brian Helgeland should get Best Screenplay and Best Adaptation consideration during awards season; Eastwood will be an easy pick and the sentimental favorite-even though his work merits any honor it should receive. On screen, Robbins and Penn will likely get nominations, though their being blowhards offscreen might trip them up in long haul. Still, none of that should matter when considering their work in Mystic River, because they both gave career performances. If I had to pick between the two, I would go with Robbins, because of his staid, disaffected affectation of a chronic victim. Penn, meanwhile, altered between being wonderful and a DeNiro indicator (what his fixation with Bobby D is, I'll never know but it often undoes his own greatness). Marcia Gay Harden will likely get consideration but I think this film was primarily a \"guy flick.\" Laura Linney, like Penn, had moments but was uneven, seeming to struggle with a Boston brogue. In a fair world, Bacon and Lawrence Fishburne would also get consideration for their efforts, because they were fantastic in keeping the narrative moving. I don't like Robbins or Penn but their effort here made me forget my prejudice and watch them for what they really are: highly talented actors who were very lucky to get work on this great film. I just hope they remember that if their names are called during award ceremony and don't go off on some Michael Moore-esque rant.

Now without \"game\", the trio starts writing their names in wet cement on a public sidewalk. Suddenly, a car pulls up....its the cops! Well, they have a badge anyway. Scaring the kids, Sean points out that he lives across the street. But, Dave, who lives one street over, is ordered to get in the car so they can talk to his parents. Crying, Dave does. However, its soon obvious to the neighbors that Dave has been abducted; he escapes four days later. Now, flashing forward, Dave and Jimmy still live in the neighborhood, with Jimmy owning a corner store and Dave doing odd jobs. Both are married and parents. Jimmy's oldest, Katie (Emmy Rossum) is nineteen and from a previous marriage. With second wife, Annabeth (Laura Linney) he has two other daughters, one who is going to have her first communion the next day. Katie works at the store and is going out on the town with two galpals. Concerned about late hours, Jimmy reminds Katie that its an important day for her sister tomorrow. Yes, Dad. But, the next day, she doesn't come to the store for the early shift and she doesn't make it to the church. Unhappily, she has been murdered and the detective on the case is Sean, who moved to a different part of Boston but is with the BPD. Naturally, Jimmy is distraught and has a gang of goons, his wife's brothers, doing their own detective work while Sean tries to reason with his former friend. There are other secrets, too. Dave, who has never been \"normal\" after his abduction and molestation, came home the night of Katie's death with blood on his person. Wife Celeste (Marcia Gay Harden) doesn't quite believe his story that he beat up a mugger. Also, Katie, unknown to all, was planning to elope with a man named Brendan Harris, who her father despises. So, what really happened one fateful night and who will pay for the crime or crimes? This fabulous movie is based on an equally fabulous novel by Dennis Lehane. Its Boston setting is seedy and beautiful at the same time and has a ring of authenticity few stories have, as Lehane was born and raised in Boston. Then, too, the actors are superb, with Penn terrifying as the tough guy Jimmy, Robbins touching as the \"damaged goods\" man, and Bacon rounding out the trio in a quiet, somber performance of power. Harden, Rossum, Linney, Laurence Fishburne, and the rest are great, too.\nSets, costumes, and cinematography are wonderful as well.

An extremely implausible plot is only worsened by characters drawn so poorly, you want to vomit.The story is about how a murder effects three old friends. Unfortunately, we only really feel how it effects one character, Jimmy, the father of the deceased. The other two characters feel to be very contrived, almost as if they are being pulled into the plot against their will. The only emotional connection between these three friends is a traumatic experience they shared in their childhood, which left at least one of the three permanantly scarred. However, as adults, they grew apart, living very different lifestyles.The fact that one of the \"former\" friends becomes a suspect in the murder, seeds the inevitable conflict between Jimmy and his old friend. There could be lots of drama and tension built up, but that would actually require the writer to sketch out the relationship between these two characters.\nInstead, we are merely left with a did-he-do-it or did-he-not-do-it mystery, which lasts way too long for the little amount of suspense it carries. If he \"didn't do it\", then we should at least be left with some reason to care who did do it. Maybe, the killer will strike again? No, not likely in this movie (though there will be more than one murder before the curtain closes). And if he did \"do it\", then we probably don't care anyway, because his character is so inconsistent and vague to begin with.The reality for the pathetic murder mystery turns out to be so pointless and unbelievable, that all potential dramatic irony gets flushed down the toilet. Then the final sin is committed: we realize that the one decently portrayed character, the one character that we thought we understood in this movie, this loving and compassionate father, is not even who we thought he was. Up to the point where we thought we understood his motives, we leave in bitter disgust. Horrible!Finally, I do not understand why the movie insists on depicting a stereotypical reference between Catholicism and pedophilia when this has no link to the plot what-so-ever.",

I get this with mist and \"Mystic River\". A graceful, ghostly charm. That's what it gets you. A cold on the spine, wet sweat and not from terror; but from Intensity. The use of grey, dampened and humid spaces give the film a melancholic yet surreal atmosphere, where the real story is somewhat violent but incredibly intense and heartbreaking.This movie is super emotional, as I highlighted, very intense. Trust Clint Eastwood: he has an encyclopedic knowledge of movies and a poetic view on life that is plunged with a fascinating impact. Watch \"Mystic River\". It will haunt you after it's over, but in a very, very good way.",

Glad they are now Oscar winners, but unfortunately not this film.The ending was becoming more and more predictable as time lingered on. The script lost it's crisp insight and dynamics. Felt like the screenwriters had so many ideas to fill into these pages that they lost the plot, the reason for writing this screenplay.The film should be used as an example of how everything in a film can start out right - from director, script, cast to technical crew and how, with inflated egos and no direction, fall apart. It is another mediocre attempt of Hollywood figures to create a great film. But there is not greatness to be found.Too bad. I really had high expectations and really wanted to enjoy the film. Clint - go watch the one film Patty Jenkins directed, MONSTER. Sean and Tim watch Charlize Theron - she can teach all of Hollywood what acting should be. Better luck next time.",

            "content": "Clint Eastwood's powerful comeback as director, continuing one of American cinema's most extensive and most intriguing observations of masculinity, Mystic River is a gloomy, foreboding scowl about a present-day crime internally connected to a past crime. It concerns three boyhood friends in an Irish Boston neighborhood, who were eternally scarred when one of them was snatched by a child molester. As men, their lives have quelled into uptight daily grinds that are disturbed by the freshest emotionally cataclysmic crime. Written by Brian Helgeland, based on the novel by Dennis Lehane, the movie features a league of phenomenal actors adept at unearthing genuine human feelings in a plot that could've been a thriller if its gaze weren't so much more grave, if it didn't summon so much authentic anguish.The film focuses on the three friends: Jimmy, now an ex-con running the corner store; Dave, a working stiff, and Sean, a homicide detective. All are married; Jimmy to a second wife, Annabeth, who helps raise his oldest daughter and two of their own; Dave to Celeste, who's given him a son; Sean to an AWOL pregnant wife who calls him now and then yet never says anything. The other prominent character is Whitey, Sean's partner. Jimmy watches like a hawk his 19-year-old daughter Katie, who works with him at the store. She's in love with Brendan. Theirs is a sugary flame. Jimmy bitterly objects. They plot to run away together. Alas, before that can happen Katie's discovered mangled and dead. Sean and Whitey are assigned to the case. Brendan is of course a suspect, but so is Dave, who came home late that night, spattered with blood, talking to his wife in distress about a mugger he resisted, may have killed.While major aspects of Mystic River work in keeping with the style of a police procedural, it's about more than the mere yes-or-no answer of blame, though Jimmy claims he will murder the person who murdered his daughter, and we have no cause to question him, mainly after he enlists neighborhood goons to lead their own investigation. It's about anguish descending through the decades, about unuttered closet skeletons, silent distrust. And it's very much about the individual honor of husbands and wives. Annabeth has a scene where she identifies with Jimmy's compulsion for revenge, and it's not far-fetched to parallel her character to Lady Macbeth. Celeste gradually starts to suspect Dave's story about the mugger and communicates her suspicions. We see one wife brutally allegiant, another who feels she has been excluded from some abysmal cell of her husband's heart.While the plot ultimately reaches a definite resolution, it's not about the resolution. It's about the venture there. It supplies each of its actors with scenes that measure their boundaries. Both Penn and Robbins generate desperate and stunning tension as they are interrogated by the police. Most memorable is their first man-to-man talk in years after Katie's death. There's a definite strand of suspense between Whitey, who believes Dave clearly responsible, and Sean, who's disinclined to doubt a childhood friend. There are such abysmal lagoons of bitterness and murderous feelings surrounding the funeral that we anticipate an eruption at any instant, but the simmering of the characters is all deep-seated. And forever that day in the past drifts as a voice from their collective past. Compounding Dave's agony was the apprehension the other two boys always had about him. Perhaps they didn't completely grasp what happened to him---how could they?---but somehow they no longer felt the same about their defiled friend, a life arrested in midstream.Penn's performance is one of the unequivocal engravings of the apex of a realist masculine tradition that engendered Brando, Dean, Pacino, De Niro. He has rid his technique of any breath of staginess or window dressing while absorbing all the straightforwardness and power that the Method's brought into American movies. Bacon, flirting with apathy, is excellent, as is Fishburne, whose drollery and questioning keep us from being submerged in the dark. Whitey's the one main character who's not associated with the insulated lineage of the neighborhood, and his wisecracks and seasoned comments are in some sense visitations from the outside world. Robbins, in some ways, confronts the ultimate assignment because he must play a man whose violated identity is an erratic composite of emotional nakedness and ferocity, innocence and deception. We feel crushingly, unfathomably sorry for him, but he puts others off, including Marcia Gay Harden, who as Celeste gives the film its most disconcerting portrait of horror and despair, just as Laura Linney, as Annabeth, arising from the abyss later on, expresses with devastating certainty the viciousness that functions as justice in their collapsed domain.This is Clint Eastwood's 24th film as director, and one of the handful of them where he doesn't also cast himself. He asserts here a full-toned unity with the characters and their actors, who are given wounding moments of truth. Invariably a downplaying actor himself, he unearths in his three actors watersheds of solitude and repression. Robbins grieves within his own despair, watches vampire movies on TV to identify analogies for his state of mind. Bacon aches all the time due to the void his wife has left. Penn's a brutal man who fixes to react brutally but has not, we see, found much relief that way in the past. To see potent acting like this is invigorating and breathtaking. It's vital to be continually reminded that movies can see, hear and conscientiously relate to their characters. Directors reach the top drawer by withholding, not embellishing: Eastwood does nothing for ornament, everything for impact.",

The first scene is perhaps the most impressive one.Tim Robbins plays yet another disturbed and rather frightening character as Dave, the man with a dark and troubled past who ultimately turns out to be the greatest victim. Marcia Gay Harden is excellent as his supportive wife and Laura Linney equally effective as her opposite, the surprisingly cold wife of Jimmy Markum (Penn).

Eastwood's sparse, unhurried direction is well-suited to the grim subject matter and to bringing out fine performances from the three leads, although for my money the best acting comes from Harden (as the wife who suspects something awful) and Fishburne (as the street-savvy sergeant). The movie is a fine character study, with a lovely simple score by Eastwood himself, but the murder plot doesn't really stand up to much scrutiny. In its more tender moments however, this is a movie filled with emotion, insight and pathos, and a wonderful example of a regrettably old-fashioned style of film-making - no pyrotechnics, realism without overacting, slow build suspense and a keen but very relaxed style. Don't miss a terrific unbilled cameo by Eli Wallach as a goofy liquor-store owner called Mr Loony - he previously worked with Eastwood on a very memorable picture just thirty-seven years earlier !!",

If this many people think this movie was great, how many innocent people are getting killed by vigilante criminals every day. Maybe the a moral of the story was 1) Never be a vigilante, you may kill an innocent man or, 2) Never doubt your husband, as you could get him killed. But the conclusion is, you are a king for killing an innocent man. The wife of the vigilante criminal calls him \"a king.\" Don't feel guilty for killing an innocent man, \"the wife never should have said those things about her husband.\" She blames Dave's wife for his death. She never should have doubted her husband. This movie is for brainless morons who think it is okay to take justice into their own hands.. NO ONE SHOULD BE THE JUDGE, JURY AND EXECUTIONER. And if the man can live with himself, and take a father away from a young boy, no wife should be praising him for it.Lastly, this movie is basically about how much it sucks to be Dave. Dave is the one of the three who gets abducted and raped for four days before fleeing as a child. As an adult, Dave ends up with the wife who doubts him and goes to the girl's father about her doubts only to get her husband, her son's father killed by a vigilante. The murder is also difficult to sit through, it's not quick. They force him to confess to something he didn't do and gang up on him.

Being the loyal guy that I am, I managed to read the novel before having the chance to watch it in the theaters; therefore my expectations were pretty high. Surely enough, I was impressed by the heart and dedication Mr. Eastwood put into consideration in restoring the events from the novel and at the same time provides us with well detailed characters that were the exact images like in the book.Sean Penn plays the leading role of Jimmy Markum, a storekeeper who had a dark past as a hoodlum and was imprisoned for his misdemeanors. Years later he has cleaned up his act, makes a decent living, devoted to his wife and kids and has put his horrid past behind him. In his younger days he became allies with Sean Devine (Kevin Bacon), who is now a crime scene investigator, and David Boyle (Tim Robbins), who had experienced a devastating occurrence in his youth and the events he saw continue to linger on in his brain to this day forward. News that Jimmy's 19-year-old daughter Katie was tragically murdered, Sean along with his partner Whitey Powers (Laurence Fisburne), proceed with the investigation and the childhood friend reunion comes into full force.The dynamic cast is what makes \"Mystic River\" so engaging to watch and is a must-see for those who admire murder mysteries and the pivotal events that transpire along as the two detectives search for Katie's murderer. It feels like the actors are not just playing the part but are actually living the roles that were given to them. Sean Penn gives a rather heartbreaking but affectionate performance as we feel for his tragic loss. Tim Robbins was convincing in his role, you get this sudden feeling that he's about to do something not very pleasant. Laura Linney and Marcia Gay Harden were also effective as the respected wives of Jimmy and Dave.The idea of filming this movie in Boston was a wise decision by Eastwood as we look to great admiration at the brilliant atmosphere created by Tom Stern which gives it a very believable and a setting that's apropos to the genre of the movie. \"Mystic River\" gives a flabbergasting demonstration of how the human race reacts when they're under an overwhelming amount of mental pain. It proves that the people we hurt or the people who hurt us back will remain within us for a very long period of time, probably even forever. I like to give kudos to Clint Eastwood for making our day and giving us an eye-popping provocative picture that the vast majority will enjoy.",

Mystic River surely is a film that will appeal to most teens, especially due to the adult subject matter and highly-rated story.

What engages you is the storyline, spectacular reviews and the stars, but you'll realise by the end that it's not what you'd thought it would be. There's no doubt that this movie is an excellent murder-mystery, but it's just not compelling or fascinating enough to class as a masterpiece. It's quite a prolonged and strong movie, so don't expect to enjoy it straight away.Even though the story may get quite slow for some, the lead performances come and save the film. Sean Penn definitely displays very powerful and sometimes disturbing emotions. The acting of Tim Robbins is also very high-impact and will impress all of his fans, but Clint Eastwood's directing is masterful as well.

The apparent reality of their shared childhood tragedy sort of leeches through little by little as their lives moves along, hinged on the well crafted scenes of grief and trauma.

Adapting the novel for the screen was Brian Helgeland, who previously won an Oscar for co-writing \"L.A. Confidential\". So, from a writing perspective, the movie certainly had all of the ingredients for a gripping crime drama.The multi-layered story is set in Boston and concerns a group of childhood friends whose lives intersect once again when one of their daughters is murdered. The screenplay expertly balances mystery and drama in a manner that evokes Greek tragedy moreso than a typical potboiler. It was nominated for (and probably should have won) the Oscar for best adapted screenplay.When it comes to the cast, it's definitely one that justifies the adjective 'all-star'. Sean Penn & Tim Robbins gave remarkable, Oscar-winning performances and the rest of the main cast was scarcely less impressive. Kevin Bacon & Laurence Fishburne played a pair of cops and contributed characteristically solid performances. Laura Linney & Marcia Gay Harden gave two very different portrayals of spouses, with Harden's particularly impressive performance garnering an Oscar nomination. The remainder of the cast was uniformly reliable as well.Eastwood's direction is generally unobtrusive and gives the actors plenty of room to shine. This results in a film that is attractive but not distractingly so. Eastwood also provided the film's score, which features a memorable motif that recurs throughout.Altogether, \"Mystic River\" represents one of Clint Eastwood's best films as a director. The stellar cast, workmanlike production and compelling story combine to produce what is arguably the best movie of 2003.",

Kevin Bacon, who seems to be a very honest cop and who was quite prepared to throw Tim Robbins in jail for a murder he suspects Tim committed, looks the other way when he finds out that Sean actually killed Tim. Everyone seems to treat Marcia's character with ostracism at the end for some reason. She thought her husband committed one murder and he actually committed another. She was mistaken but she was completely guiltless of anything, nobody died by her hands but everyone seemed to blame her.Do I understand what was supposed to be depicted on the film at the end or did I miss something? An early scene that bothered me too was when Laurence Fishburne mentions that he stole Tim's car to find some evidence and then Tim is brought in for questioning. A lot of action seemed to have transpired that we weren't privy to. I thought for a minute that a reel was missing in the movie.Without the last fifteen minutes, I probably would have given this movie an 8 or a 9. With it, it's a five at best.",

In Mystic River, as in Unforgiven, we see damaged characters doing their best to cope with their memories of the past. Three childhood friends were scarred by an incident that occurred while they were playing street hockey. Chance brings them all back together again about thirty years later, basically to show us all the pall that childhood incident cast on the rest of their lives. Ordinary reality is distorted by their respective consciences, and we see how each one struggles to come to terms with the memory that will not go away.This is not a feel good movie, but it is a good movie. It is a movie about what happens when life has dealt us the Queen of Spades. There are no heroes here, only people doing the best they can at what they know.

It seemed as if Clint Eastwood didn't quite know how to reconcile the gritty family drama/tough childhood character study with the murder mystery, and the script certainly didn't help.  There wasn't enough good character moments, and at times there was too much plot.  The resolution of the investigation was rushed, and then the movie kept going; the second ending was very slow, and jarring.  It just wasn't satisfying, it just wasn't good.",

Moments in time in which our lives and the lives of others are altered by one singular movement, one phrase, or that one hockey shot that was just out of reach. Nothing is more true when it comes to the lives of Jimmy (Sean Penn), Sean (Kevin Bacon) and Dave (Tim Robbins). Mystic River is an emotional and amazing film about the reconciliation of three friends and their wives by the tragic murder of Jimmy's eldest daughter, Katie Markum (Emmy Rossum). This rough Boston suburb that lies on the bank of the Mystic River is thrown into sorrow and misery over the loss. Jimmy (Penn) makes a vow to find the killer of his daughter and end him and throw him into the Mystic.The story is superb. Twists and turns and changing plot lines makes this story brilliantly unpredictable. It proves nothing is what it seems. Dealing with issues of child abduction and the effects it has on the future, Mystic River watches and deals with the change n the course of someone life. What something would be like if Dave hadn't gotten into that strangers car? Katie Markum would never had been born to be murdered.The acting is bar none and has been recognized by the Academy by awarding Sean Penn and Tim Robbins best actor and best supporting role at the Oscars. Sean Penn was incredible in this film. He was so into his character. An angry gangster trying to move on with his life, and get out of his life of crime and deceit. To love his children and to be the best father he can be. Strong and determined, hard and angry he tries to deal with the grief of the loss of his last real memory of his late first wife. Penn is perfect in performing this role. Tim Robbins is also and incredible actor. A man who had been abused neglected. Finally admitting to himself of the abuse he felt. He kept himself bottled and up. An angry and almost psychopathic man, who is doing his best to try and overcome the terrors he experienced by hopping in the car. An ensemble cast also included: Laura Linney, Marcia Gay Haden, Laurence Fishburn.Mystic river is truly amazing. Clint Eastwood is an incredible director. If you like Million Dollar Baby (and who doesn't! Iti s also brilliant) then you will simply love Mystic River. I would highly recommend it for anyone.",

It contains some high-quality scenes, but as a whole, it's very disappointing, mostly due to the fact that it has one of the worst endings I've ever seen. The ending is so bad, it ruins the entire movie, which is a shame when you consider how much better the movie could have been with just a few key changes (mostly to the third act). Toward the end of the movie, one of the most likable characters is killed off unnecessarily. His murder is deeply dissatisfying, and everything about it, including the aftermath (in other words, the rest of the movie), which the writers also flubbed, feels like it belongs in an inferior draft of a much better screenplay. The ending is not just dissatisfying, it's disgusting. Jimmy's wife, Annabeth, is a repulsive human being, and the final scene with her is nauseating. Mystic River ends on a horrible note. Of the movie's two tragic murders, one is shrugged off, and the other is not only defended by the perpetrator's own wife, but not investigated by a character who is a police officer! (He doesn't arrest the culprit, either, despite the fact that the perp more or less confessed to the crime). And then we're expected to give a sh*t when the police officer's wife decides to come home? Such a reunion seems trivial during the aftermath of the ruthless murder of a major character, whose death, I might add, was not grieved by a single character, and was almost entirely glossed over. But even disregarding the two murders, or at least the more recent one, I had zero emotional investment in the police officer at this point, anyway, and can't imagine other viewers having much more. Come to think of it, I cannot recall a single point in the movie where Kevin Bacon's character did anything that might arouse the slightest bit of sympathy in the audience. Yet, by the end of the movie, more focus is given to this minor subplot to do with his wife and to a random parade than to the overarching plot of the movie! Mystic River had the potential to be an excellent crime drama, but it squanders the talent of its leads to create a movie that is extremely unpleasant, incredibly frustrating, and vastly overrated.",

I just couldn't believe (as I was watching this film) that this man was behind the camera in all this process. Behind everything. He has created an environment for his characters, a place and time for their development. This doesn't come much often.An event happens, and it establishes the bases for the rest of the story. But it's not just about that event, I thought myself as I heard the words said from Brian Helgeland's real screenplay. It's about the people involved in that event. It's about the lives these people carry with. There is so much focus on the characters that in occasions we let the event aside.Sean Penn made two great performances in 2003. One was the man he portrayed in \"21 Grams\". The other one is Jimmy Markum, and I can't tell which of these performances is greater. So many words are trapped in his eyes when he is crying. Jimmy wants everything to be alright, and he would do anything to achieve that goal. Penn is the kind of actor that makes you feel the way he does.Tim Robbins found the note here. Well, he always finds it, but this one sounds better than any other. Maybe this is just the character he was looking for. Dave Boyle is the person that could become a phantom. He could not know where he is. He could have been somewhere else for too long. He could be in a trance. And to know that, you just need to look at Robbins's face.About Sean we sense loneliness. He is waiting for his second chance, and doesn't mind to wait. He would wait a whole life. Bacon has never been recognized for his work. I don't know if he had the chance with Sean's role. But I can give him the fact that he is a risky actor. He doesn't mind going deep.And women, always there, for men. They don't seem to be that important for their husbands. But they really are. Celeste loves Dave, and trusts him. But she can't do that when some other things are happening, although she wants to. There's a limit. Marcia Gay Harden is great. She shows a lot of emotion always, you can't keep your eyes off her. Her performance here could be, or is, as good as the one in \"Pollock\". There are also those wives who know all, and wait until things happen. Annabeth is that kind of wife, and Laura Linney shows it in most of the film's key moments.The cinematography is wonderful, as the music and the details in each frame.But these three friends, I mean: \u00bfWhat has happened between them? \u00bfIn who they've become? \u00bfWhat do they feel for each other? There's a strong string that unites them. They have been in the same places and they truly understand why they do what they do. They grew together, and know that some things changed them. Maybe they are not the same persons anymore, but how could they find out.How.",

They are films for the average American, everybody has got to understand them. The same goes for Mystic River.Mystic River is about vengeance and justice and the latter has always a relative phenomenon in Eastwoods movies. But immorality has not been a steady subject in his films, and so the end proved rather surprising, it being much closer to the simplistic view on life belonging to Mr. Penn, who might be a talented actor, but fails miserably as a compassionate human being.

            "content": "A good morality play shouldn't end with a maxim.  It should leave those watching it troubled and questioning and, perhaps, pointed in a good if not a right direction.Taking Dennis Lehane's novel of the same name, director Clint Eastwood has, with \"Mystic River,\"  blazed through issues of love, loyalty, responsibility and the dilemma of unshakable experiences that haunt not only those who experienced them but that reach into the next generation.At the beginning of \"Mystic River\" three boys, not yet teens, play a street game and then divert to carve their names into just hardening sidewalk cement.  A car stops and an almost obviously bogus cop berates the kids before ordering one into his car.  Without explicit depiction, flashbacks clearly show that Dave, the abducted boy, was sexually brutalized before escaping.Fast forward to the present in a dreary, near-Boston, blue collar neighborhood hard by the Mystic River.  Dave (Tim Robbins) is married to Celeste (Marcia Gay Harden) and they have a little boy who is as devoted to his dad as the father is to him.  Dave doesn't smile much, he sort of shuffles, his mind and body the unwilling curators of indelible indecencies experienced in early life.Jimmy (Sean Penn) runs a corner candy and variety store, his days of serving time for robbery long past.  Is he reformed?  One wonders as his life unfolds.  Jimmy is married to Annabeth (Laura Linney).  They have three daughters and before the film gets very far the oldest, Katie, is brutally murdered.  A departure from the usual plot, she clearly isn't the victim of a sex crime.  A senseless murder?Laura Linney starts as an apparently average, not too interesting spouse. In one scene near the end of the film she unleashes an emotional passion that brings the moral quagmire of Jimmy's actions to a boil.Returning to the tried and true theme of boys growing up in a tough place and one becomes a cop while the others lead ordinary but hopefully not criminal lives, Sean (Kevin Bacon) is a Massachusetts State Police homicide detective who works with his partner, Whitey (Laurence Fishburne).  Sean's the one of the trio who went to college.As the story unfolds the detectives, having made a simple but crucial mistake, search for the killer while Jimmy, clearly a capo in the hood, starts his own inquiry, one somewhat less restrained by law than that of the police.Dave emerges as a suspect not only for the police but to his increasingly confused and distraught wife. She confides in Jimmy, not knowing that his announced plan for the killer, if he finds him, does not include turning that person over to his old friend, Sean.So much for the plot.  What is portrayed here are some of the most angry and tortured expressions in recent film.  Sean Penn invests his role with a range running from tenderness to anguish to methodical and cold calculation. Initially sympathetic because of his loss, his character's increasing complexity calls for viewers to try to understand a personality that has also been ravaged by decades of a troubled life.Marcia Gay Harden gives a haunting performance as a loyal wife whose suspicions lead her to do something she must know erodes her loyalty to Dave and whose consequences slowly dawn on her.  A stellar performance.Bacon and Fishburne make a good cop team.There's a clue, fairly early in the film, as to what happened to Katie.  I won't reveal it and I suspect ninety percent, at least, of the audience in a packed theater missed it.A little boy on a parade float at the end of the film painfully shows how the cycle of evil and loss experienced by one generation infects the young of the next.  That scene shook me up.\"Mystic River\" is a certain Oscar contender.  Clint Eastwood also composed some of the score but he deserves enormous credit for using music sparingly. This is a drama that would have been very damaged by an intrusive musical presence.10/10.",

It's basically an exercise in red herrings.  What was the point of this movie?  It certainly wasn't to entertain.  If it was to preach, what was the message, `Life sucks.  Too bad'?  `Stand by your man \u0096 or else'?  There are a lot of stupid devices in the movie, like one character's estranged wife calling him all the time and not saying a word. What was the point of that?  What did it have to do with the rest of the movie?  Of course, it has lots of 90s psychobabble and has child molesting as its centerpiece. And the cast is far too OLD.  At one point, a character is described as `mid-30s' and the character is played by Tim Robbins, an actor who saw his mid-30s a long time ago.  Even if it had been done really well I still would have hated it.  I see no point in this movie's existence.",

The movie stars Sean Penn as that man who loses his daughter and goes through that midlife crisis with the law and to trying to find the man who murdered his daughter. The movie also has a great supporting cast such as Marcia Gay Harden, Tim Robbins, Laura Linney, Laurence Fishburne, and Kevin Bacon. Director Clint Eastwood has crafted the best movie about a midlife crisis since Robert Benton's 1979 film Kramer vs. Kramer. Especially featuring a great script by Brian Helgeland, and great photography by Tom Stern. This movie truly touched me in all the correct emotional and I also felt bad for Sean Penn's character in the film as we all should because of what he went through emotionally but it is still a great movie.A+",

The movie did pick up a bit, but overall was a complete waste of time. Unsatisfying as a whodunit, and lots of bad acting. Overall, the amount of Oscars won and nominations received is totally shocking, based on how unentertaining and flat the movie is. The whole first hour we couldn't help remarking on how plot elements which are usually alluded to through subtle devices were revealed clunkily in the dialogue, which seemed like a rough draft of a treatment rather than a final Hollywood script. And the music? It was no surprise to see at the end that Clint Eastwood wrote it. And did it really have to be 137 minutes long? I'm sure at least 20 minutes - or maybe all 137 - could have been cut with no loss at all.",

Academy award winners Sean Penn and Tim Robbins played perfect roles and I guess that is why you could give them those Oscars. Kevin Bacon and Laurence Fishburne also had good roles as both cops. The script was superb and the dialouge was very crisp. I remember renting this movie and my family got to see it and I didn't. So about 6 months later, I finally got to see the movie on TV. Besides of all those positives of the movie, there were barely any negatives, but I had one and I had to say that the movie got pretty slow at times. It built up very slowly and I wanted it to go faster but other than that this is a good Clint Eastwood film and I was glad to finally see it. I recommend it. Hedeen's Outlook: 8/10 *** B",

Also, Katie's murderers were caught because of the gun shot on her body. So, the movie brings out the relation between dead bodies and how to get away with murders. I can imagine Jimmy killing her daughter's real murderers and dumped them into Mystic River again, not only for justice but also being fair, after all, he had mistakenly killed Dave for that.",

Tim Robbins is superb as well as a man haunted by terrible memories he experienced as a child. All I can say: go see this movie, even though it's fairly slowly paced.

            "content": "***contains spoilers*** Okay you watch a film, there ares one confusing bits in it, some scenes don't make sense, thats understandable, because in a self proclaimed 'mysery' film you expect everything to be explained in the end. But that isn't the case. I'm not going to go on about the moral message the film gives out, I don't even mind that Jimmy's wife turns out to be evil and The Sean might have let Jimmy go, but their actions aren't explained. The film makes out to be better than it really is, but then you find out it isn't. I mean seriously the film could simply have started out with the cops receiving the 911 call and then finding out it was the kids who did it, simple that's it. but they insist on going on about how Dave is kidnapped and sexually assaulted as a child, which I understand will affect him badly, but it's too much to expect it would really have affected Sean and Jimmy that much. In fact how the beginning scenes are relevant is baffling...apart from explaining why Dave decided to attack the child molester in the car. The most annoying character in the film has to be Dave's wife who surely cannot have an IQ of over 50, because she practically kills her husband by telling jimmy what she thinks..with no solid evidence I mention, instead of perhaps mentioning it to the police. I believe 75% of a film is the ending, and the ending just ruined it...not because I wanted a nice happy ending, but because their was no logical reasoning behind it. Two kids randomly come across a girl who happens to be the girl friend of the brother of one of them, and for some reason thought it'd be funny to scare her with a gun, and to make sure she doesn't talk, chase her across the woods, best her with a stick and shoot her...oh and incidentally she said hi to them after she swerved off the road. That's it, the whole story in that paragraph, the whole Sean, jimmy and Dave thing, is off no relevance at all, it's just an over dramatisation. In the end Sean tries to suggest they were all in someway metaphorically abducted...I felt like go into the TV and shaking him hard...you were stood on the road, you weren't the one locked away for four days, how event possible affected your lives is beyond me...or maybe I missed something. and the whole thing with Sean's wife, what's that about??!! I mean seriously, was the woman who played that role a personal friend of Eastwood and asked to be in the film. Watching Sean and his partner playing good cop bad cop was funny enough, without having to see Jimmy wife go on about ruling Boston, because to rule Boston all you need is 3 guys and yourself. Unlike many of the people here i didn't predict the ending of the film as early as 30 minutes, more like an hour and a half, but that's because after believing the hype I expected more than just two kids did it, and it was an accident really oops...I thought the child abduction, Sean's wife weird calls, the fact that Jimmy thought he had something to do with her death, and all the other irrelevant stuff might all link together in a clever way. but really let me tell you now if you're thinking of watching it, basically the tow kids did it, they didn't mean to though, forget everything else in the movie that's basically it. Whether Sean decides to let Jimmy go or not is unclear, either that's down to poor directing or acting, but you get the impression from the films ending he's letting jimmy go and mysteriously his partner who seems to be the kinda cops who wouldn't let things like that rest disappears...Ohh I'm sorry I'm going on , but this movie annoys me, maybe I should read the book, it might make more sense. and as for getting Oscars...Give me 50 million and i could make a film to get an Oscar, just have over acting, over dramatisation and big emotional scenes...I'm not sad I spent 2 hours watching the film, but put it this way...my mum was watching Sister Act the other day, and even that made more sense than this film.",

The happenings seem to conjure up the concept of karma as I follow the lives of the characters, especially as in the case of Sean Penn's Jimmy. Excellent performances from Sean Penn, Tim Robbins and Kevin Bacon! Their characters \u0096 three friends - draw me deep into the analytical observation of their traits, behavior and circumstances. I was kept bouncing between the good and evil of their souls. With this film, Penn has become my No. 1 favorite for the Oscar statuette! I'd be surprised if this film isn't nominated for the Best Adapted Screenplay award. Tim Robins, with his Dave's facial demeanor, grips at my heart. What a perfect actor for the Dave role! Marcia Gay Hayden's performance credibly becomes the solid bridge between the incredible depth of interaction between the Dave and Jimmy characters. The story flows wonderfully on screen and stays true and loyal to Dennis Lehane's novel of the same title.  Is the film drawing a fine line between revenge and the psychological weight of suffering? Should I be wondering who is purportedly the real victim of the story? Should I be looking at the rippling effects of guilt that never seem to leave the victim(s)? Under the brilliant direction of Clint Eastwood and the remarkably superb performances of the whole cast ensemble, the awful truth about twisted and profound human psyches develop beautifully, layer by layer. I was literally holding my breath, puffing out soft gasps at intervals, as I followed each character and each event. Yep, this film is filled with exceedingly touching elements. A real tough and phenomenally intense movie to watch! Eastwood has given the audience a very dark film in which every actor delivers an essentially awesome part to make the whole soulful and captivating. I choked with grief as the final tragic twist unfolds \u0096 exactly as how I had choked when I finished reading the novel.  It's an unforgettable film. I'd be surprised if I don't get to see the names of Eastwood, Penn, Robbins and Hayden in the coming Oscar nominations.

Honestly, this was some of the least compelling dialog since the silent era.And I apologize to any Eastwood devotees out there, but is anyone else getting tired of his plodding, paceless films besides me? He has to lugubriously draw your attention to the most mundane details just to make sure the audience doesn't miss anything. And the character through lines? \"You're the hard case of the group,\" says the kidnapper to the young Jimmy, who we've just seen write his name in concrete, so now we'll know who's who when they're grown up. This is what passes for character development in this absolute joke of a film.Can you imagine what Eastwood would have done with Memento? There probably would have been forty minutes of awkward expositional conversation about memory loss, then violins as he gave away the ending.

Above all this is an actor's movie and the actors are all up to snuff, I will see anything in which Laura Linney appears but she was well served here by her male cohorts and though it is impossible to feel any sympathy for Sean Benn, who plays a man half a step up from a Neanderthal, he does it as well as anyone.

Clint Eastwood is a talented director, who has contributed some great films (UNFORGIVEN is the top of it's genre, and BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY stomped any other pocketbook romance adaptation), but this is real amateur night. The script is an unrealistic (bad) joke. Penn's character looks like Michael Douglas' hit-man from ONE NIGHT AT MCCOOLS (not a serious film, but still leagues higher than M.R.), and acts like some by-the-numbers thug, complete with his own circle of goons, that do super-cool macho things like charging through police lines and ordering cops around.

The fact that Jimmy doesn't show any remorse for killing Dave after realizing it wasn't him is what made this movie into not as good as it should've been.Sean Penn and Tim Robbins give great performances, certainly worthy of the Oscars they received.

This is a film, not only about friendship and loyalty, but also paranoia, love, suspicion, and the perils of vigilante justice. The story just draws the viewer in like a good novel. The viewer just doesn't know how the story will play out and what kind of direction it will go in.

In truth, it made me want to rip my hair out by the sickening nature of it. However, the viewer should have been aware that it wasn't going to be a pleasant film watching experience from the beginning. Sure, the result of the story is upsetting and gross, but at least it didn't lie to us. It is an honest, effective, and thought provoking film.

Eventually escaping, but haunted into adulthood by his huge trauma, Dave becomes the main suspect when Jimmy's daughter is found dead. Sean, assigned to investigate the crime, finds himself facing both unpleasant issues from the past and unpleasant issues in the present as the circumstances surrounding Katie's death are uncovered.The cast was perfect. There are no words to describe the outstanding performances by Sean Penn and Tim Robbins. In addition to that, there were stunning performances by Kevin Bacon, Laurence Fishburne, Marcia Gay Harden and Tom Guiry. In my opinion, Laurence Fishburne is particularly praiseworthy for his tough, hard nose investigator who prevents his partner from making understandable emotional compromises in analyzing the growing body of evidence. Fishburne is convincing and impressive. However, the character that stands out the most is, undoubtedly, Penn's Jimmy Markum. I'm glad Sean Penn finally won an Academy Award, he's a brilliant actor and he certainly deserves the recognition. All of his scenes perfectly capture the emotional rage of the character. Penn's sheer brilliance completely anchors the film. Clint Eastwood delivers an amazing psychological thriller with considerable tone and artistry as it progresses towards its extremely painful and melancholic resolution. This movie literally grabs you and shakes you, and makes you watch it, no matter how painful it can be.The depth and emotion that is in each and every scene is remarkable. It's hard to believe that \"Lord of the Rings\" won Best Picture instead of \"Mystic River\". One of the best we've had in decades of film-making. 10/10",

This great story that Clint Eastwood directs in an unbiased way, based on the novel, is being supported by powerful performances. No wonder why Sean won the Oscar for the leading role in this one. He is simply amazing. Also, Tim Robbins (won Oscar) captures masterfully his tormented character. Generally the whole cast is excellent , and I think there should be an Oscar for Marcia Gay Harden.

            "content": "This is one of the most dreadful, pretentious movies I have ever seen. I was shaking with anger as I walked home afterward. Eastwood has taken his lifelong \"you can't win\", sour, nihilistic vision of life to ludicrous extremes in this contrived melodrama.To be fair, the novel by Dennis Lehane is hopelessly flawed to begin with. Lehane likes to use big themes (the Holocaust in \"Shutter Island\", child molestation here) to give false importance to conventional, uninspired murder mysteries. This movie is NOT a serious examination of child molestation; it uses that horrific crime merely as an excuse to supply the story with a character (Dave) who can behave in wild, irrational ways and serve as an all-too-obvious suspect in the murder that takes place. Dave's actions have no psychological rationale; watch the scene where he's interrogated by the police (Kevin Bacon and Laurence Fishburne) and he goes from hopelessly terrified to calculating in a few seconds, for no reason.Eastwood compounds this by shooting everything in a slooooow, gray, somber, humorless style. He's so busy making a \"statement\" about how hopeless and unfair life is that he doesn't notice how unbelievable most of the devices are--like a a symbolic hulking teenager with an over-sized hockey stick, who would have been considered hokey in a silent movie. And I'm tired of hearing about all the \"great acting\". Eastwood sabotages his hardworking actors (especially Penn and Robbins) with sealed-off, overlong closeups (as if he were pre-selecting their Oscar clips). Poor Marcia Gay Harden, as Robbins' wife, is saddled with a scene where she has to walk, step-by-step, up a long staircase while staring \"in horror\" at Robbins in the hall below--and LIGHTNING STRIKES OUTSIDE! (What is this, \"Dark Shadows\"?) The best performances are the least acclaimed--Bacon and Fishburne's tough, unsentimental cops, and the great Laura Linney as Penn's wife (although even she is destroyed by a last minute, 180-degree turnaround Lady Macbeth scene which no one could pull off.) I suspect a lot of people feel the same way--this movie never really became a big hit, despite the overmarketing and Oscar hype. See a Rodgers and Hammerstein musical instead--it'll be a lot more believable.",

            "content": "Mystic River involves abduction, sexual abuse, murder and vigilante justice, but by far the most frightening thing about it is Laura Linney. As the second wife of reformed criminal Jimmy Markum (Sean Penn), we have seen her smiling as her daughter collects her first Communion and winced at her husband's constant reference to his first wife, but right at the end she emerges as a social Darwinist and endorser of violent means, any means, to protect the family home. You may have killed the wrong man, she says, but you did it for our daughters, so it was the right thing to do. She stands blue-eyed and pitiless, regal, at a street parade awash with American flags.The film is set in Boston, a grey New England city. Clint Eastwood directed: he maintains a steady pace, and a stately distance from his actors. Eastwood has an extraordinary feeling for flesh: every member of the cast has an indelible physical presence. The story centres on three childhood friends: Jimmy Markum, Sean Devine (Kevin Bacon) and Dave Boyle (Tim Robbins). As children, they are one day on the street when a mysterious car halts, and a man pretending to be a figure of authority abducts Dave. He is held in a cellar for four days before getting away. The movie jumps forward thirty years: Jimmy's nineteen year-old daughter is murdered, and Dave falls under suspicion. Sean is the investigating officer.The actors are extraordinary. As a man who cannot get away from early trauma, Robbins' eyes are simultaneously cloudy and brimming, twin bright orbs of darkness. He shuffles, shoulders hunched, and talks in a disabled mumble. Bacon is concise: there is no excess flesh on his face, even in his cheeks. Penn grows more rugged with time: his gathering wrinkles give him a sense of solidity. (His grief is contrasted with that of his daughter's boyfriend (Brendan Harris). Tears come easily to his smooth-skinned face, round like a doll. No matter how genuine, Harris' feelings do not have the same sense of gravity.) Then there is Linney, with her terrible blue eyes.It emerges that Jimmy was an underworld king, an Irish-Catholic don. In the course of Mystic River he re-assumes that role: he has two thickset thugs carry on an investigation into the murder, and acts on their findings. Dave's wife (Marcia Gay Harden, a twitching, fearful contrast to Linney) makes a confession to Jimmy and he hugs her, as though absolving her of any wrongdoing. Finally, he makes a delayed entrance into a deserted bar where an intended victim is already hemmed in by the thugs. The film might be subtitled: How a reformed crime boss might justifiably take back his mantle. Eastwood relies on the heavy feeling of dread that hangs about the movie like a fog to steer us to a conclusion not justified by the material. We return again and again to the sidewalk where Dave was abducted (The boys scrawled their names there in wet cement.), as if to say: in a world where something like this can occur, anything goes. I disagree.",

And the cheap maneuvering scenes at the end with Dave's wife were atrocious? Guess it was supposed to all be her fault for not trusting Dave more... Jeez..\nAnd the movie was even lousy in the suspense end too, since it was pretty obvious from the 911 call and the scene in the drugstore (with the handicapped brother tagging along) about who had done the actual killing. And even the tired \"kill one's sibling's lover to monopolize\" scenario doesn't hold water since it was supposedly a chance encounter on some street near the park (the car ending up riding the curb etc.)\nIt's pretty bad when child molestation feels like it's being used as a cheap gimmick...

And guess what: I was wondering which composer makes such a bad soundtrack, and discovered the composer in the end credits: CLINT EASTWOOD did the soundtrack.Old man, please leave the film sets of this planet. A quite impressing line-up of actors worked for you not because you are good, but because you are Clint Eastwood.And what's up with the ending? Good message it gives to the people. To kill a killer, no matter what, is ok, as long this person is 'out of the normal order'.There were so many bad twists and turns in this movie, I don't know where to start. And  just a good tip by  an advanced film student: Look at the bad staging. The actors not only act as if they don't really know what the story is all about, a lot of the so-called 'matching shots' don't match at all. For example, there is a scene where Sean Penn is looking to the ground when he is listening to someone, and in the next shot (the same time!) is watching the person straight in the eyes. And then we switch back to the other camera position, and his head is down to the ground again! So what?Please tell me what is good in the this movie except the unchallenged actors and the more-or-less interesting film-noir photography. I did't find something else.",

            "review_title": "The best Eastwood film since UNFORGIVEN!",
            "content": "Ever since I saw UNFORGIVEN, I was conformed with my thoughts on Clint Eastwood.  I always thought of Eastwood as the \"action-packed,\" gun carrying superstar who said tough-guy lines like \"Do ya feel lucky punk?\" and the classic, \"Go ahead, make my day.\"  Then after watching UNFORGIVEN, I was blown away on how different of a western it was, aging gunfighters, who are past their prime, now are going to be doing one more job.  Now I am a strong devotee of Clint Eastwood, watching and buying DVD copies of all of his films (that includes the hokey EVERY WHICH WAY and ANY WHICH WAY films with \"Clyde\"). With MYSTIC RIVER, I was a little disappointed not seeing Clint in front of the camera, which I always do enjoy.  Yes, he's pushing 73, but still, it's a nice familar face.  But after watching MYSTIC RIVER, I got past not seeing Clint's face, yet his work as a filmmaker showed. MYSTIC RIVER is based on the Dennis Lehane best seller, which takes place in a certain section of Boston, near the river.  Three boys are playing on the street and decide to use a stick to write their names in the wet cement. A car pulls up and a tough looking man comes out saying he's a cop, and is threatening to arrest the boys for defacing property.  After the officer asks where the three boys live (two lived on that street, one lived a few blocks away), the boy who lived a few blocks away is ordered by the man to get into the back of his car to \"take him home.\"  The scary and sad thing is that the boy wasn't taken home right away... Flash-forward to 25 years later, where the three boys are adults. Jimmy (Sean Penn) is a business owner of a corner store, he served some time in prison, got out and is trying to make a new life. Jimmy is in his second marriage to Annabeth (Laura Linney) and has three daughters, Jimmy's eldest daughter, Katie (Emmy Rossum) is 18 and works for Jimmy at his store. Sean (Kevin Bacon) is a Boston homicide officer who still gets phone calls from his ex-wife who doesn't say a word, yet Sean knows it's her and talks to her still with no response.  Then there's Dave (Tim Robbins) the adult who still is suffering emotionally from the time he went into the backseat of the police officer's car. On a Saturday night before Jimmy's daughter's communion, Katie goes out driking with some friends.  Later that night, Dave came home with blood on his hands and shrit, Dave's wife, Celeste (Marcia Gay Harden) is worried on what happend to her husband.  When Jimmy and Annabeth go to their daughter's communion, Jimmy is upset that Katie didn't show up.  Sean along with his homicide partner, Whitey (Laurence Fishburn) get a call about a car sitting in the middle of the road with blood.  It turns out that the car was Katie's, with Katie's body found not far from the car.  The story has several conflicts and revealing information about the character's of the film as the plot continues. I was highly impressed and pleased with MYSTIC RIVER.  After watching this film, KILL BILL Vol. 1, SCHOOL OF ROCK, and LOST IN TRANSLATION; the last four weeks of movies have been much better than the last ten months. It is obvious why critics are calling this one of the best pictures of the year, it's because its true! I was hooked on the mystery of both the character's past that was involved with the plot, as well as the mystery about the murder of Katie. It's no surprise why the mystery for MYSTIC RIVER works so well, the screenplay was written by Brian Helgeland, who won an Oscar along with Curtis Hanson for his adaptation for L.A. CONFIDENTIAL, the best crime-noir film since CHINATOWN.  The film manages to give full rich detail on the three characters and even gives detailed information of the supporting characters as well. Another important factor in which Eastwood should be applauded for is shooting the film in the actual location in which the story takes place, outside of Boston.  If there is a film or story where the location becomes part of the character, then it's critical to have the story take place in that location, otherwise it won't have right feel for the movie.  Think of Michael Mann's HEAT taking place in L.A. but shot in Chicago, it would take away the impact of the film.  With MYSTIC RIVER, Eastwood demanded that the film needed to be shot Charlestown, Boston instead of the studio's decision of Toronto (because it's cheeper). The acting by Sean Penn is along with Bill Murry, as one of the best this year.  I have always enjoyed Mr. Penn's work (I've can see Penn being the most talented young actor under 50 (along with Edward Norton and Johnny Depp).  Penn gives a very fantastic performance in this film, you could actually feel his grief when he finds out that his daughter was killed. Yet kudos should also go out to Tim Robbins for his performance of Dave, the man who is still scarred by the actions that happened to him 25 years eariler. Robbins manages to have a convincing look of emotional scars that have been haunting him for years, and it shows in his eyes.  I also enjoyed the performances and the investigating plot of Kevin Bacon and Laurence Fishburne's characters.  Bacon can be a great actor in a bad movie (HOLLOW MAN for example) yet Bacon proves that he can even carry his own performance along with Robbins and Penn.  And Fishburne shows that he is one of the most powerful supporting actors working in Hollywood with this film. I would finally have to give credit to Eastwood himself.  No longer being seen as the man who is use to carrying a .44 magnium shooting bad guys. Now he's the figure who thinks about even questions on why did he shoot that man, like he discussed in UNFORGIVEN and in this film as well.  Eastwood manages to tell a story in which the characters might appear fine, yet they have ghosts inside of them that will haunt them forever.  And before I forget, Eastwood's brauva talent shows again by being the score composure for this film!  I expected the usual great music by Eastwood regular Lennie Neihaus, but when I saw that Eastwood composed the music, I was pleasently surprised.  Also, for those other Eastwood fans out there, a familar face makes a unexpected yet highly enjoyable cameo appearance.  I'm not going to say who it is, but when you see this familar actor and make the connection, it is a nice treat. MYSTIC RIVER proves once again that Clint Eastwood is one of the best directors still working. Sadly, most people can't imagine Eastwood as anything else but Dirty Harry; and when Eastwood passes away, people will then say, \"oh wow, he did do a lot of work.\"  Well, I'm saying it now, Eastwood is a underappreciated director, watch his other directed films: BIRD, BRONCO BILLY, BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY, and MIDNIGHT IN THE GARDEN OF GOOD & EVIL, and you too would hopefully agree with me that Eastwood is a darn great director! There is no doubt that MYSTIC RIVER is going to be remembered come Feburary when the Oscars are announced.  I can see this film having nominations in several catagories, especially Best Actor (for Penn), Best Supporting Actor (Robbins), Best Director, and Best Picture.  This film was even nominated for Best Picture at the Cannes Film Festival, which in my opinion is the more suitable Academy Awards.  Look what won Best Picture at Cannes last year- Polanski's THE PIANIST.  I rest my case.  One of the best films this year! ***** (out of five)",

            "content": "Clint Eastwood does a great job of getting the best out of some very fine actors in this urban working class instant classic. Sean Penn, reminding me of some of the best work by such stars as Al Pacino and Robert De Niro, is absolutely authentic as Jimmy Markum from the mean streets of Boston, a guy who brushed with the law, went straight, and then, when his beloved daughter comes up murdered, is tested and found...All too human.He is supported by Tim Robbins as his boyhood chum Dave Boyle, a man tottering on the edge of sanity, a man haunted by a childhood abduction by pedophiles, one of whom flashes a priest's ring. Penn won an academy award in 2004 as Best Actor, and Robbins won as Best Supporting Actor. Best film that year went to Lord of the Rings, but Mystic River couldn't have been far behind in the voting.Kevin Bacon, the third of the boyhood pals who have gone their separate ways in adulthood, plays Sean Devine, a homicide detective with the Boston police. He also does a great job. His sidekick is played by Laurence Fishburne who brings the very familiar black police detective role to a new level of excellence with his balanced and realistic portrayal. Also excellent is Marcia Gay Harden as Celeste Boyle, Dave's wife, who through stupidity, fear, and a misreading of human grief, makes a fatal mistake in judgment, a mistake that leads to a needless murder.The story itself is riveting. Eastwood's direction is tight, focused, always believable, and atmospheric. The script by Brian Helgeland, adapted from the novel by Dennis Lehane, is nothing short of mesmerizing. This movie is that good. It reminds me a little of some great mafia classics like The Godfather in the way it depicts east coast urban America: the family ties and betrayals, fateful acts born of anger and frustration, stupidity and human frailty, and most notably in the high quality of all aspects of the production, especially the most important ones, story, character and veracious setting and atmosphere.A couple of other things set this film apart. One is the interesting and deep psychological situations that some of the characters find themselves in. Detective Sean Devine has an estranged wife who calls him but doesn't speak; Jimmy has dark secrets in his past known only to himself; Dave Boyle does something that nobody knows about until the end, something totally in keeping with his character; and finally, the boyfriend of Jimmy's daughter, Brendan Harris (Tom Guiry) knows something that solves the murder in his mind, but he doesn't want to tell it just yet.The second is, even as Brendan runs home to confirm what he knows, you'll never guess who murdered Jimmy's daughter. Only in the next scene as the film nears its climax, is it clear what happened and why. And the difficulty isn't anything artificial as is so often the case in movie thrillers. The difficulty results from a beautifully constructed story based on a realistic and believable plot that makes us feel when the truth finally comes out, that it is right and understandable although almost impossible to guess beforehand.See this for Clint Eastwood who, with this film, can take his place alongside Hollywood's great directors, and for Sean Penn who gives the performance of his life.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book \"Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!\" Get it at Amazon!)",

            "content": "Think back on the best movies of the previous ten years. Films like `Pulp Fiction,' `Fargo,' and `American Beauty' probably come to mind. Now, consider adding `Mystic River,' the new film from Clint Eastwood, to that list. It is one of the most stirring and enthralling American movies of 2003! This can be attributed to its fantastic cast including Sean Penn, Tim Robbins and Kevin Bacon and to the impeccable direction of Eastwood. Based on a novel by Dennis Lehane, `Mystic River' tells a story that is so riveting that the audience cannot pull themselves away from it.\t`Mystic River' tells the story of three childhood friends whose lives are forever changed by appalling events. While children playing in the streets of a Boston suburb, one of the boys named Dave Boyle is kidnapped and abused for four days. Twenty-five years later, another one of the three friends, Jimmy Markum (Penn), is devastated by the murder of his nineteen-year-old daughter. The murder unites Jimmy and Dave (Robbins), as well as their friend Sean (Bacon), the detective assigned to the case. With the help of fellow detective Whitey Powers (Laurence Fishburne), Sean uncovers past secrets about both Jimmy and Dave, from Jimmy's time spent in prison to Dave's emotional stress relating back to his childhood abduction. The end result reveals fact and faux pas about each man that they all hoped would be buried forever. The amazing aspect of `Mystic River' is that it shows how one event can lead to future personal flaws. Indeed the event of the Dave's kidnapping as a child wounded all of the boys. Both Jimmy and Sean both comment, `imagine how life would be if I had gotten in that car instead of Dave.' Dave's scares are apparent in his disillusionment of the reality around him. He can't seem to connect with anybody except his son who he feels a need to keep life innocent for since Dave's childhood innocence was so horribly taken away. Jimmy spent time behind bars for a robbery and now he's become a crime boss that everybody respects in the Boston suburb. As for Sean, he's managed to ruin his marriage because he shut his wife out of his own feelings and needs. \tThe performances are extraordinary! Penn gives a stellar performance that will undoubtedly garnish him a nomination for the Best Actor Oscar.  He leaves the audience shaken in so many scenes. Particularly the scene where he finds about his daughter's death: one, for the very fact that she was murdered and two, because she was only nineteen. After all, what parent would want to bury their child? It should be the other way around.\tRobbins gives an excellent performance as Dave, the troubled man dealing with his past by not dealing with reality. It's troubling to watch this tragic character and his emotions unfold. You can't help but feel his pain. At the same point, you realize that he is not dealing with reality completely and he needs help. \tBacon and Fishburne are equally incredible for their roles as detectives. Since Bacon's character, Sean, has a past with Jimmy and Dave, Fishbune's character, Whitey, acts as a voice of reason. He reminds Sean to look past the loyalties of friendship and to conduct the case in a proper manner.\tEastwood has crafted a film filled with intrigue for its troubled characters and for its absorbing story. Undoubtedly this film will be considered at Oscar time. What's more, it is quite possibly one of the finest American films of the past decade. ****",

If you haven't seen it, I'll have to quote something my 9th grade English teacher used to say: \"Go out, and get it tonight.\" Well, there aren't any Blockbusters any more. So, stay home, and illegally download it tonight.This film has LAYERS. Like the layers of a blooming onion you get at Outback Steakhouse. This movie is DEEP.First Layer: The superb crime mystery/thriller aspect of the movie. Who killed Katie Markum? Everyone suspects Dave, who has been acting strange and came home to Celeste at 3am covered in blood the same night Katie Markum died. But this is a Hollywood movie, so everything is not as it seems. Or is it?Next Layer: Characters. This movie has great acting. It received Academy Awards for best actor (Sean Penn) and best supporting actor (Tim Robbins) the year it came out. Their performances are so gripping, and deal with such difficult characters, 3-dimensionally, that it would be hard to disagree with the Academy's choice. This isn't a good-vs.-evil story, with a hero cop rushing to stop a sociopathic villain. This is a story in which everyone is human, they all make choices, and those choices have consequences. Very Shakespearian.A Deeper Layer: Philosophical/Intellectual. Like all great movies and pieces of art, this movie deals with the weighty questions of human nature. How far should a man go to avenge the death of his loved ones? How much of our lives are made up of our own choices, and how much of our lives are influenced by the choices of others? How much does fate play a role? I suppose that the movie's title, \"MYSTIC RIVER\" is also the strongest metaphor in the film. It can stand for many things.Without a doubt, this film is Tragic. Tragic and Brilliant.",

            "content": "This is a very multi-layered film that seems to revel in confronting the viewer with moral ambiguity. The upshot of this is that it becomes thought-provoking and causes self-analysis in the viewer, the downside is that it's not the kind of movie you watch just to kill a couple of hours.Firstly I'm surprised that people are demanding a change in the ending... the film ends the way it does because the book ends the way it does. Mystic River's novel origins can also explain why certain aspects of the story, such as Sean (Kevin Bacon)'s relationship with his wife, aren't as fleshed out as they might be.There are also complaints that the way Dave (Tim Robbins) is shot because it 'makes him look guilty'. Surely that's the whole core of what allows the audience to sympathise with Celeste (Marcia Gay Harden)? Her already damaged husband comes home covered in blood, glosses over how it got there and steadily becomes more and more erratic over the course of the following days. Importantly, the audience is never given a clue that he may be innocent of Katie's murder, and neither is Celeste. This makes her confiding in someone understandable, even if Jimmy (Sean Penn) probably wasn't the person to confide in.The story ends where it does to allow the reader to make up their own mind. This was never going to have the pat Hollywood ending with Sean racing to Dave's rescue, probably accompanied by a five-minute car-chase. It is this that makes the story believable, if not entirely likely. It is never explicitly stated that Sean will let Jimmy get away with Dave's murder - in fact the 'gun finger' shot is probably one of the most ambiguous set-ups in the movie.Anyhoo, my interpretation, with added spoilers: Without a body, the only evidence against Jimmy was circumstantial. It was already established that local law enforcement doesn't have cutting-edge CSI techniques available to them, as they couldn't do a DNA test on the blood in Dave's car. I suspect it would also weigh on Sean's mind that putting Jimmy away will deprive Katie's two younger sisters of a father as well as a sister.Jimmy puts a brave face on in the final scene - but is he really as sanguine as he appears? He demonstrated on the porch that he's not just a heartless thug.As has been pointed out before - Ray Jr. killed Katie because he didn't want her to take his brother - the only person that actually spent any time with him, remember - away... a boy who can't speak ends up speaking out in a terrifying way.Though it's never vocalised, I suspect that Sean told Jimmy that the shooting was an accident to prevent him from taking it out on older brother Brendan - after all, had they not been secretly dating, they wouldn't have been planning to run away and Katie would still be alive - It wouldn't take much for Jimmy to reach that conclusion.All in all a good film to watch, but those in search of a happy ending would be advised to watch elsewhere - this doesn't detract from the film's quality as a cohesive whole though.",

            "content": "Kurosawa once said: \"With a good script, a good director can produce a masterpiece. With the same script, a mediocre director can produce a passable film. But with a bad script, even a good director can't possibly make a good film.\" Mystic River is proof positive.It feels redundant to remind you how great Eastwood and Penn and everyone else is, so I will concentrate my analysis of this film on it's screenplay.Mystic River fatally suffers from a plot that depends *entirely* on coincidence. It is simply not satisfying. It barely stands up to one viewing, let alone multiple.Robbins was molested as a kid. As an adult, he encounters a pedophile and beats him to death on the same night that another girl is shot and beaten to death. This girl just so happens to be the daughter of Penn, who was a childhood friend of Robbins and was there when Robbins was abducted as a child.It doesn't stop there. Robbins is at the same bar at the same time as Rossum the night she was killed/Robbins kills pedophile.And if that's not enough, Rossum was shot with the same gun that was used in an event from Penn's past that connects him with the killer of his daughter.Oh, and Robbins as the same blood type as Rossum.This script constantly attempts to make a connection between Robbins and Rossum, but since there is none, everything thrown in is a contrivance. There is no cause and effect between anything in this film. It is not believable for an instant.There are many other problems as well. Fishburn and Bacon toss exposition with all the originality and creativity of a CSI: Miami episode, and that subplot with Bacon's wife? Remove it from the film and the main \"plot\" does not change. It is literally pointless.This film is a perfect example of why cause and effect must be used to tell an effective screen story.",

            "content": "Of course as per usual the bad guys (mobsters) get away with it and the technically good guy dies (even though later it's revealed he killed a molester) and we're supposed to feel like it was a great story because it's a tragedy? Huh? The tragedy is I'm glad the daughter died in the first place! Jimmy (Sean Penn) really deserved it! What this movie showcases well is that God will bring justice and take your daughter if you make stupid decisions! Hahah. This movie also shows that there can be a cast of characters and you will root for none of them. No one is likable sorry!Let's talk about certain individuals and inconsistencies...Jimmy (Mobster): Why is he portrayed as a guy we should sympathize with if he has killed many people before? (you can assume so and he admits it) Is he that cold-blooded that he doesn't even feel much guilt towards the end of the film? What of Dave's widowed wife and his son? Does losing his daughter now make him a mafia boss? What exactly does he \"do for a living\"? Is he really straight now or in the illegal drugs business? Was he ever really straight if he was sending a dead guy's family 500 bucks every month?Sean (Cop/Detective): Why does he say he would arrest anybody even if it's his friends when speaking to the Sargent but hesitates to do so when confronted with basically an admission of guilt from Jimmy? Does this film imply that cops are afraid of mobsters? Is he for or against justice? What the heck does that ending scene mean as he finger shoots Jimmy? \"Hey, you got away this time but next time I'll get ya! Soon as I'm done being a father and a husband to my wife who came back home?\" Does he feel sympathy for Dave's son or now is he taking a break and happily ever after?Dave (Tim Robbins): Do we assume he's an intelligent character? He certainly knows how to respond to the police when interrogated. Besides the stories that don't add up, wouldn't it be logical to believe that at some point he would have admitted to his wife that he beat up a molester and placed the body behind the bar before his wife left him or accused him of murder of a friends daughter? Is their relationship in that much turmoil that she confides in other men besides her own husband? Dave is obviously traumatized but he's not stupid. There is no reason to be lying and making himself look like a suspect in the murder case. At least keep the story consistent! As I was watching the movie I hypothesized that Dave KNEW who the killer was that fateful night (the mute boy) but was not going to snitch on him out of pure pity. It turns out he didn't tell the truth because he wanted to save his own ass from the discovery of a molester who he had beaten up? Then at the end he's going to save his own ass again by admitting to something he didn't do?Celeste (Dave's wife): Okay, her character is pretty stupid. Would any wife on\nEarth tell the victims father, \"Hey I think my own husband murdered your daughter and I'm afraid of him\"? Why not tell the cops this and stay quiet in the meantime? Why not relay this information to the cops and extract the truth out of Dave? She has no refutable evidence besides her gut feeling and some minor circumstantial evidence. Does she not believe in her husband or in a fair trial? Does she feel guilt in her husbands disappearance and \"eventual\" discovery of his death?Also, Sean Penn and those mafia goons are just downright pathetic! What is this the 1940's? If you're going to intimidate someone bring more men and firepower! The Japanese Yakuza would make these guys look like bickering children! I mean they played tag with the cops in the opening scenes trying to get to Jimmy's daughter...they wouldn't dare lay a hand on the cops and now all of a sudden we're supposed to assume that the cops can't catch any of these dimwitted goons? They can't stick any charges on them? It's not like they're geniuses and run an organized crime syndicate now c'mon...This film really did suck I'm sorry to say Clint.",

I've seen TV shows pull it off better. The acting? The Characters were written well so pretty much anyone decent would have done a good job. Tim Robbins probably had the only really good performance yet he was the only one given a challenging role. I don't really buy the \"guy crying\" or \"physically challenged\" best actor awards Hollywood gives out. One scene you'll hear an actor with a brooklyn accent, the next with a california accent and the next with a Boston accent. And how much did they get paid? The plot? This could have been a GREAT movie. With just a few little changes. There were enough twists and turns to make you wonder a little but after having to battle through the flaws, I didn't really care who did it at the end and was ultimately disappointed at the unconvincing attempt to name a killer. So weak and powerless.The Direction? Eastwood must be getting really old because there were so many obvious flaws it was distracting. Maybe if he'd come off his high horse and let someone with talent direct it (like someone his grandsons age) it would have at least let the cameras do some talking so the actors didn't have to do the \"wink wink\" thing. The Ending . LOL!!. When I thought the movie was going to end, I was thinking \"ok, not a bad ending, I get it, mystic river. Not bad.\" That was before they actually said the words Mystic river and before the real ending came. I'm still in awe that they ended the movie that way. Don't get me wrong, I was very glad that it ended but I couldn't help to laugh at the ending. So utterly pathetic and meaningless and drove what could have been a sort of decent film far into the depths of mediocrity",

            "content": "I first saw Mystic River in 2003. I hated it. I found Sean Penn to be incredibly over the top and self congratulating in his performance (something I still think he is guilty of in almost every film I have seen of his) and the story was sinister high hokum.Now six years on return to the scene of the crime and find myself about turned. I was fourteen, or thereabouts, when I first saw Mystic River. I was yet to really learn the distinction between actors and superstars, and I thought that the film was a whodunit thriller entirely commonplace of Hollywood.It's not.As I said for my summary it is naive to watch this film thinking that it is about finding a killer. It most certainly isn't. It is a film about friendship, time and loyalty. The film makes way for female characters whom despite their domestic roles within the drama are entirely as important as the male ones in helping us to understand not just the characters, but the nature of the city the story is about. It is well acted for the most part and I found myself loving Sean Penn's performance, a rarity for me. It is rare that a film of this sort can turn the victim into the villain without it seeming like high hokum. Penn achieves this admirably, and while I still wish Bill Murray had won the 2003 Best Actor Oscar I am less enraged than I once was at his snub. Penn is certainly the second most deserving man of that year.Furthermore, the film is immersive in the detail of Boston as much as it is in us understanding how time changes friendship and family loyalties. Kevin Bacon superbly handles this. It is his now-outsider to the home he grew up in that emphasises the significance of the passage of time and how little childhood memories really affect the future.There are still problems with the film. Tim Robbins' performance just feels misplaced. Undeniably the most important character of the story somehow Robbins part on page and on screen don't feel fleshed out enough. There is so much more to this character than the film allows. His Oscar win was an undeserved one. Seek out Ken Watanabe's performance in The Last Samurai to see the true supporting performance of that year.Mystic River is a deeper, slower and more moving one than its placing within the thriller genre suggests. It is not as pacey as say Gone Baby Gone, another Lehane adaptation, nor as suspenseful as much of Eastwood's other work. But I do stand corrected.Mystic River is a very good, albeit flawed, film. See it and be rewarded, but be patient with it or you'll find yourself hating it for all the wrong reasons.",

It is poorly written, badly acted and unbelievable from the get-go.  It seems that our friends in South America may agree with me, based on some of the comments I've read.  I really wanted to like this movie--some of the best reviews of the year, I think Tim Robbins is great, I enjoy most of Clint Eastwood's films as director (with the exception of another overrated pile of rubbish, Unforgiven).  POSSIBLE SPOILERS:  Sean Penn and Robbins' characters are supposed to be as close as brothers, so the finale by the river was just not believable.  And what exactly was Laura Linney's character cause for her sudden amount of hatred towards Robbins' character?  The inclusion of Kevin Bacon's and Lawrence Fishburn's characters were distractions, at best, and did not do anything for the story.  Now I have no problems with downbeat movies that require an amount of thinking by the viewers (examples of recent movies in this category that I really enjoyed are Requiem for a Dream, The Ice Storm, and Happiness).  But I don't enjoy movies that shamelessly manipulate the audience into caring about characters with no appealing attributes and are unconvincingly portrayed and caricatures at best.  The \"great\" acting in this movie consists of the actors breaking down in tears every five minutes or so.  And the Boston accents--just ridiculous.  Especially Laura Linney's. So I'll close this by saying that, on the plus side, the direction is rather good (although I still prefer the understated direction Eastwood used in his recent movies like Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil and older ones like Play Misty for Me). I still have a lot of respect for the actors, despite their performances in this movie--but I'd like to see Sean Penn get nominated for something totally out of character for him (heck, I preferred him in I Am Sam over this).

The second hand begins to roll along and promises that maybe something interesting will be revealed, but as the movie hits its climax you realize it has nothing to offer. At best it is a good portrayal of a particular kind of neighborhood and family life that may be fading.The interesting thing is that very good actors are sunk by the script or the direction. Many talented people, who have done very well in other movies, struggle and fail here. The only actor not completely taken down is Kevin Bacon.

            "content": "When asked what an actor should do to develop his craft, on \"In the Actor's Studio\" guest Actor/ Director Clint Eastwood said that one should master \"the art of listening.\" Watching Eastwood's \"Mystic River\" we get a sense that we are ease-dropping on a private conversation. \"Mystic River\" is the work of the director who has a mastery of his craft. Eastwood is also directing actors who are at the top of their game: Sean Penn, Kevin Bacon, Tim Robbins, Laurence Fishburne, and Marcia Gay Harden. This is an extraordinary accomplishment given the nature of the story-- it is difficult to sit through. Brian Helgeland (\"L.A. Confidential\") wrote the compelling screenplay from the novel by Dennis Lehane. \"Mystic River\" tells the story of three childhood friends, Jimmy Markham (Penn), Dave Boyle (Robbins), and Sean Devine (Bacon) growing up in Boston. As the story begins Dave is abducted by two men posing as police officers, and is molested. Jumping to the present day, Jimmy's daughter Katie (Emmy Rossum) is found murdered, and the homicide detective investigating the case is Sean (Bacon). At the same time the very scarred and repressed Dave (Robbins) has a suspicious incident with a mugger that he confesses to his wife, Celeste (Marcia Gay Harden). Hence, boyhood friends are reunited as grown men who are somewhat broken. Jimmy, a drugstore owner, has apparent mob ties. Dave, who is now married with a son, is shell of a man. Sean has been estranged from his wife and son-- he does not know where they are. So Sean along with his partner Whitey Powers (Fishburne) must find Katie Markham's murderer in a case that seems inherently linked to the past. This is by definition a difficult story to tell, and Eastwood keeps us enthralled and moves us. The intensity of the movie comes from its simplicity and eloquence. Its power derives from Eastwood's use of silence, and his confidence in his actors' mastery of listening. Sean Penn as Jimmy is absolutely powerful. There is a scene in the movie where he cries about his daughter with Robbins's Dave that is electrifying. Jimmy is clearly the marquee role. Penn should deservedly receive an Oscar nomination, and even perhaps win. Though Kevin Bacon's performance as Sean, the less showy of the lead characters, is simply stunning. It is great to be reminded what a powerful actor Kevin Bacon is. You never catch him acting-- he is just being. As Sean he is doing his best, solving a murder case while completing his past and his present. Bacon possesses a quiet power, and restrained vulnerability. In a scene near the end, Sean just listens and does not say a word, and it is haunting. We are watching an actor who is truly generating and creating art. Tim Robbins as Dave gives a heart-felt performance as broken man clumsily regaining his nobility. \"Mystic River\" is a rough journey, and it ends surprisingly quietly. I guess much like Wordsworth said in \"The Prelude\" that we can never return to innocence, it's just life. And it goes on. \"Mystic River\" is one the year's best. Clint Eastwood, and writer Brian Helgeland along with Sean Penn, Kevin Bacon, and Tim Robbins show that when you have a master director, a solid story, and the best actors around you have art. And props to Clint for demonstrating that simplicity is an element of mastery.",

I was expecting too much of it, I think.Turns out, this was a very poorly written screenplay, incredibly bad directed acting. I'm in shock at knowing it got two Oscars for acting. I mean, no fault to the actors, they did as the script and directing told them to, they had the potential to be amazing. Sean Penn really dedicates himslef for this role, as well as Tim Robins. Kevin Bacon was very good as well, in my opinion, the best actor in this movie, just because he was the most believable. But, oh man, Eastwood didn't direct that acting at all. The script really didn't help either, it actually screwed everything. The dialogues are very poorly built, it very badly explores the characters past, without setting up an emotional bonding beween them and the viewers. I didn't care about anything happening on screen. The characters were dull, shallow, but had the potential of being amazing. That's the difference: the story had a good concept and skeleton to be worked on, but the screenplay completely blew it. The progression of incidents throughout the movie is incredibly bad, so awfully told. If this had a solid script, I mean, it could be a three hour long movie, no problems, a script that cared about shaping properly these characters' past, taking its time to give details on how it influenced the future we perceive, an actually misterious plot, that didn't induce you to jumping to obvious conclusions, if it cared about telling the stories of the many different characters that just serve as puppets to the narrative and are in no way explored, but, at the same time, are huge pieces of the storytelling, and only if it was directed by either Scorsese or David Fincher (the two directors I kept thinking would make this a directorial masterpiece), this would definitely get a ten.I'm truly disappointed. This could have been an incredible film. It wasn't.",

A child's innocence should only fade away with time and by no means should it be corrupted, and especially not when the child is on the brink of maturity . The poignant turn of events towards the end of this movie so clearly evinces why. Agreed, its a well written book , but its the genius of Clint Eastwood which makes the adaptation so incredibly engrossing and emotionally charged . This movie is so full of subtle messages like a husband-wife relationship and the trust that should encompass such a relationship . The River itself is a brilliant metaphor . It really lies in the realm beyond perceptual apprehension . Its only apt they should call it \"Mystic\" . Of course , none of these without the supreme performances by the entire crew and especially Sean Penn and Tim Robbins . Sean Penn makes me wonder if he actually wrote the book . I couldn't otherwise possibly explain such wonderful immersion inside the character with so much intensity. All in all , Mystic River is one of the best movies I have ever watched .

The first three quarters of this year produced very few movies that rose above \"entertaining\". Hell going into October there were only three movies I had seen which I would qualify as great, Phone Booth, X2 and Dirty Pretty Things(T3 came close). Then came Kill Bill. It blew everything away and was my lock for movie of the year...that lock lasted an entire week. Mystic River is THE best picture of 2003 so far. Better than Lost in Translation, better than Th13teen, better than Phone Booth and, yes, better than Kill Bill.Mystic River takes you on an emotional ride through a small neighborhood and a murder which brings very ugly memories, and even uglier futures. I won't go over the plot, cause really it's pointless. Plus I don't wnat to spoil anything although it really doens't matter. This aint about a big twist ending or a big shoot-out ending, Mystic River's ending is just another step in life and it's heart wrenching getting there.I must first commend the great Clint Eastwood(one of the most underrated movie makes of our time IMO). This movie features no quick cuts or camera tricks. No special effects or action set pieces. It features realism(and soemtimes graphic realism), it features real characters gonig through troubles and trying to find real solutions. Eastwood has a sure hand in all this and stages the film perfectly. Not one shot is wasted and it is all Eastwood's vision, all the way down to the beautiful score.The acting, just by the actors names, you know is good. But I never expected it to be this good. Sean Penn wins the Oscar already with his performance. If he is not rewarded with the best actor statuette it's ultimate proof of the Academy's bias and BS. Penn is gut wrenchingly powerful in the early part of the film but in other parts is coldly sadistic but with a reason and thus even in his more sadistic scenes there is a sense of truth and tragedy towards Jimmy, making this Penn's greatest performance of his great career.Tim Robbins puts in, arguably although only Shawshank comes close, the best performance of his career as his lack of emotional range fits perfect for Dave's traumatic state. Laura Linney, Marci Gay Harden, Laurence Fishburne and Kevin Bacon provide ample support to the leads making this the best ensemble cast of the year.Overall there isn't much to say about Mystic River except this will move you and it will make you feel. It could possibly be classified a Shakesperean tragedy rewritten in modern time. The guilt, the revenge, the inner struggle it's all there. The acting is the best of any movie this year. But in the end this is Clint Eastwood's movie and, as he always does, Eastwood \"makes our day\" by making the best picture of 2003.****3/4(out of 5*)",

His direction is plodding and impassive. He's known as one of Hollywood's fastest-working and most cost-efficient directors, and the results are apparent on screen. \"Mystic River\" is no exception.

Their worlds have shattered since the murder, and what bond they may have developed in childhood seems to have been breached, as friends become fiends and conversations become confrontations, in the search for the killer of Jimmy Markum (Penn)'s daughter. Enduring a tormented childhood, in having been abducted and apparently reformed (\"I don't know who came out of that car, but it wasn't me\"), Dave Boyle (Robbins) soon becomes chiefly suspect in the murder, as his countenance and demeanor seem to indict him with such a heinous enterprise with good suspicion. Thus ensues a somber study of grievance, trust, question, and ultimately, tragedy. Eastwood's powerful, meticulous direction and study of character (from Markum, Boyle, and Devine), to their respective love interests, to those earlier sore acquaintances who might have played a hand in the murder, through adept, clever, and human dialog, and an effective darkness of setting, supplying the dismal tone of the events at hand, along with the somber, remorseful, genuine performances (particularly by Penn and Robbins), makes \"Mystic River\" an odyssey of the abysmal worth embarking upon. It packs an effusive emotional punch in all of its efforts, and enables the audience to become engaged by literally everything the characters undergo, in this \"Mystic River\" of grievance, suspicion, and repentance, in a genuine human study of even the most adjacent of subjects (best friends) enduring worlds of tragedy on their own. Though somewhat lacking a fulfilling resolution, I would give \"Mystic River\" high marks as being an exceedingly critical and heartfelt telling of a most somber and tragic chain of events. ***1/2 out of ****",

            "content": "# 2 Film of 2003Mystic River' was one of those films where I was really excited about it, but also afraid about it. You see, prior to 'Mystic River' Clint Eastwood hasn't made a decent film in six years. He's a tremendously talented film director (he's very multi-talented too - he directs, produces, performs the musical score and sometimes even acts in his movies), but 'Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil', 'True Crime', 'Space Cowboys' and 'Blood Work' all flopped impetuously. Even 1997's 'Absolute Power' wasn't anything great (it was good, nothing to hand out any kind of award for, though.) Eastwood's new film featured remarkably talented actors like Sean Penn (Oscar Nominee), Tim Robbins (Oscar Nominee), Kevin Bacon, Marcia Gay Harden (Oscar Winner), Laura Linney (Oscar Nominee) and Laurence Fishburne (Oscar Nominee). It was even based on a great novel, and the screenplay was written by Academy Award Winning screenwriter, Brian Helgeland, but still I had my skepticism. Well, I can tell you that 'Mystic River' was not only a masterpiece, it's one of the best films ever made.The film, adapted from Dennis Lehane's praiseworthy dramatic novel by the same name, follows three childhood friends, Jimmy Markum, Dave Boyle and Sean Devine. One normal gloomy Boston afternoon the boys are playing a game of street hockey and are stopped by two local cops (one of which played by The Wire's John Doman \u0096 a show in which Dennis Lehane writes for). The cops badger the boys and eventually take Dave off in the car. Sean and Jimmy tell their parents, and later it is known that the two were es who molested Dave. Dave managed to escape the dark and creepy basement in the middle of the woods where the two es were keeping him, and make it home. After that day, Dave was emotionally scarred and drifted apart from his friends Jimmy and Sean. Eighteen years later, Jimmy (Sean Penn) is a hardened ex-con who owns and runs the local convenience market and is married to a tough broad, Annabeth (Laura Linney), Sean (Kevin Bacon) is a detective with the Boston police department, and Dave (Tim Robbins) is a blue-collar worker with a wife, Celeste (Marcia Gay Harden) and a son (Cayden Boyd). The three have drifted far apart, when the of Jimmy's oldest daughter, Katie (Emmy Rossum \u0096 The Phantom of the Opera) brings them all together, with Sean leading the investigation with his partner Whitey (Laurence Fishburne) and Dave being unfortunately a prime suspect. The non-stop emotional roller-coaster that is 'Mystic River' begins. First of all, Clint Eastwood does an unquestionably superlative job directing this masterfully crafted slice of cinema heaven. Eastwood provides us with an authentic, vivacious and experienced vision, making 'Mystic River' his finest achievement yet. Brian Helgeland (L.A. Confidential) provides an Oscar worthy screenplay with rich character development and some of the finest dialogue film has ever seen. The acting is also extraordinary in 'Mystic River', with not two, but three actors giving the best performances of their career. Sean Penn plays his character with such indignation, frustration and raging emotion it stands as one of the ten best screen performances of all time. Tim Robbins is almost equally as brilliant in his greatest performance to date, as the conflicted, haunted soul that is Dave Boyle, while Marcia Gay Harden (also in the best performance of her career) is nothing short of meritorious as Dave's concerned wife. Kevin Bacon is almost faultless, Laura Linney never ceases to impress with her very limited screen time, and Laurence Fishburne is rock solid as Sean Devine's clever partner, Whitey. 'Mystic River' also features a haunting yet beautiful musical score (composed by none other then Clint himself) and a very powerful ending that will no doubt choke you up. The picture may drag a little bit towards the middle, but the film very much plays like a splice of life in that it is not always fair, not always climatic and never, ever sappy. Like '21 Grams', 'Mystic River' is a very realistic picture when relating to real life, but it's not quite as dark as '21 Grams', neither as jumbled (which in this case is definitely a positive thing.) There are numerous aspects about 'Mystic River' to cherish, so if you don't mind a bit of a downer, 'Mystic River' will take you on a wonderful and genuinely thrilling ride. I cannot recommend 'Mystic River' more. Bravo, Mr. Eastwood, Bravo! Grade: A (screened at AMC Deer Valley 30, Phoenix, Arizona, 10/17/03)MADE MY TOP 300 LIST AT # 18",

Yet what is so interesting about Clint Eastwood's movies is that we can study the characters and actually relate to them. I think back on \"Unforgiven\" where Eastwood's character William Munny was forced to do what he did after money and the death of his best friend where involved.The film's prologue shows three young boys from Boston; Jimmy, David and Sean as they play street hockey in the middle of the neighborhood, they lose the ball in the sewer and see a sidewalk filled with cement that hasn't dried and decide to write their names on the cement as a trademark. A car arrives as two old men who are pedophiles pose as cops to the three young boys and threaten to arrest them unless they go back to their parents. The cops ask young Davis on where he lives, and tells them that he lives on the other side. As a threat, they'll arrest him unless he goes with them to drop him off. The old men kidnap David for four weeks until he escapes from their cell, leaving him a burden he will carry for the rest of his life.All three men are grown up now and have different lives.Jimmy (Sean Pean) is the crook who has gone to jail already. He runs a mom and pop's store in the neighborhood where his oldest daughter (Emmy Rossum) works with him. He is also the neighborhood tough guy where two cousins from his wife (Laura Linney) are in his gang.Sean (Kevin Bacon) is on the opposite side of the law where he is a detective who can't seemed to figure out why his wife left him while she was pregnant and doesn't want to say a word over the phone.David (Tim Robbins) is still living the burden he carried when he was abused. His wife Celeste (Marcia Gay Harden) can never seem to figure out what is wrong with him as well, just the fact that he comes home one night with a wound and a hole in the middle of his shirt.All three characters are re-united after the death of Jimmy's daughter in which Sean is the detective working on the case with his partner (Laurence Fishburne); David is consider a suspect in the murder case while Jimmy himself gets his wife's cousins to ask everybody in the neighborhood if they know anything about his daughter's murder.\"Mystic River\" is a story about the past coming back to haunt those who experience the pain, and now coming back to those who didn't deserve it. With top-notch acting and superb directing from Eastwood himself, \"Mystic River\" proves to be a masterpiece in guilt.",

            "content": "It is a truism in the world of soap opera (the purest form of modern melodrama) that the characters must always do the dumbest possible thing to propel the story forward. While this is not egregious in melodrama, it is so in drama. Yet, a large portion of film today is pure melodrama. I think of highly lauded films like Michael Mann's Heat as melodrama incarnate.Another truism in regard to films is that actors turned directors tend to not be very good. Mel Gibson, Ron Howard, and Kevin Costner (Academy Award winners in direction) come to mind, as does Clint Eastwood (another Oscar winner). Perhaps the only actor-cum-director who has proved his chops artistically, though, is Woody Allen, although he was really a stand up comedian, not an actor. Actors tend to direct very ham-handedly, with static camera work, and no real sense of film's visual aspect, and even less skill at understanding what constitutes good story structure. Eastwood is very much in this vein. In his highly lauded Mystic River Eastwood shows that he has everything it takes to direct TV movies of the week, but not serious art. This film is larded with poorly framed scenes, bad lighting, very pedestrian angles, color-strained, as well as bad performances, a horridly unrealistic script, banal music, and too many red herrings\u0085. There are some nice touches- like abused Dave's name drying half-finished in the cement, but they are too little in depth and too few. More often the script, by Brian Helgeland, merely allows wallowing for the actors, and denies them any real chance to show real emotion. Like the poor In The Bedroom, Mystic River had a chance to be an adult meditation on grief, rather than a plot reject from a 1970s cop TV show like Kojack or Starsky And Hutch.The basic problem is that most moviegoers simply do not understand nor appreciate good writing- everything is homogenized down into a lowest common denominator plot mulch. I've read other critics state that Eastwood is a jazzy director, in that he tends to just riff. Well, maybe so in other films but in this one he's at his Director's 101 worst. The film is dull and predictable, and the acting is forgettable- certainly not indelible. You know this when there is nothing unique about a performance and any other actor could have pulled off the part. So it is with the three main characters.",

South Boston, or \"Southie,\" the Irish enclave remembered for it's anti-busing riots in the 1970s and where a respected legislator had a brother who was a notorious gangster, has always been proud of it's clannish anti-authority way of life.  This story focuses on three guys from Da Naybahood with common demons to be exorcised.********  POSSIBLE SPOILERS FOLLOW  *************************\nAt the outset we see three kids playing street hockey (the one who grows up to be Sean Penn is especially well cast) who, after losing their ball down a sewer, kill some time carving their names into some wet cement.  A rough-looking mug with handcuffs dangling from his belt announces he's a cop, asks where they all live and demands that the kid who lives more than a few blocks away get into his car.  Of course we modern viewers who know about sexual predators are inwardly urging the kids to run away, but director Clint Eastwood (who, I wish, would just direct from now on; I really don't want to see him get any older on-screen) puts the time and place to good use: it's BECAUSE the creep barks profanity at them that these slum kids believe he's a cop.(Had Clint asked me, I would have suggested he not show any of the kid's captivity or abuse, to make that good ol' power of suggestion work for him. Also, did we really need one of the perverts to be wearing a crucifix? Didn't Clint already take his shot at Christianity in \"A Perfect World\"?)Twenty-five or thirty years later these three fish still live in the same bowl.  One became Penn, a semi-reformed small-time crook with lots of tattoos who runs a grocery store; one became Kevin Bacon, a glum State Police detective whose wife has left him; the molested kid became Tim Robbins, who doesn't seem to have a job and walks around in a kind of trance most of the time.  The plot is triggered by the violent death of Penn's feisty daughter who's been dating a guy behind her father's back.  I haven't read the novel upon which this movie is based, so I don't know how important the \"whodunnit\" aspect originally was, but here it seems almost an excuse for Eastwood to revel in the squalor of these unhappy little lives. Screenwriter Brian Helgeland is always inclined toward allegory but in his better scripts, such as \"LA Confidential,\" there's enough quirky detail to bring it all to life; here the characters are so isolated they might as well be on stage in \"Waiting for Godot\": they don't watch TV, except for Robbins watching a horror movie that leads into an awkward aria about the living dead; they take no interest in world, national or local news; they don't go to Little League games or wash their cars or play bingo at church events; they just look depressed and express varying degrees of angst. The only signs of life are from a couple of local lowlifes (subtly named Savage) who made me wish they had their own movie, just as someone wrote a play about Rosencrantz and Guildenstern from \"Hamlet.\" Eventually the \"mystery\" gets resolved, but the \"real\" climax involves Penn's vigilante quest for his daughter's killer & even that is pretty predictable once Penn gets the notion Robbins is the killer.  Eastwood's clunky handling of suspense makes even old black and white silent flicks look as slick as Brian De Palma in comparison.  Credit to Eastwood for not trying to concoct a \"happy ending\" with \"closure.\"  It ends with the major characters watching a parade---\"here we are in our little enclave with life passing us by\"--- each wrapped up in his or her own concerns.  Missing are the dead girl and her overwrought boyfriend, who if he had any sense followed through on his plan to leave town, with or without her...Other than Penn chewing up the scenery and Marcia Gay Harden doing more wide-eyed horror-stricken takes than Fay Wray in her prime, all the actors do a good subtle job.  Robbins in particular brings some nice dark shadings to a character who reminds us there's nothing \"ennobling\" about being a victim of something.  The technical aspects are all fine.  Director Eastwood is doggedly determined to \"pace\" the scenes, but I kinda admire that nowadays.  The kids in the audience can get back to their frenetic video-game lives soon enough.  A major treat is Laurence Fishburn as Bacon's police partner, nicknamed \"Whitey.\"  The script never addressed this apparent anomaly, which I kinda enjoyed.  Only a few quibbles: so many items of apparent plot importance that we don't get to \"see,\" only hear discussed.  \"What, somebody had a gun?  Somebody was sending money?  What was that about Brooklyn?\" ..... etc. Also the device of having Bacon's ex-wife call and say nothing, allowing him to \"vent\": that seemed really really really really lame.And so to these hapless beleaguered characters and the baseball team that's broken a whole region's hearts so many times: all the best to y'all, & there's always \"next year\"....But damn: Wakefield wins two games for the Sox in that series and then gives up a first-pitch homer in the bottom of the eleventh, to the kid from the Cincinnati Reds yet?   Isn't that just a little too much Curse to bear?",

One suggestion I want to make could answer some of the critics I have read in several comments : I see this movie as an allegory about the death penalty. In this case, the fact that we know very little about the actual culprits and that the scene were they are arrested is fairly short is unimportant. What really counts is not that they are guilty, but that Tim Robbins' character is not. Penn's wife speech after the death of Robbins is that of the people in favor of the death penalty to Justice represented by Penn: OK we make mistakes, but we show strength. Bacon's shooting sign is the weak and ineffective attempt of the people who oppose the death penalty to have the Justice system get rid of it...but maybe I am over analyzing here.",

Lehane's books are mediocre; this film is a work of the tragedy of life, as Shakespeare gave us in Romeo and Juliet and Macbeth (Annabeth was aptly named). Mystic River gives us mistaken identity, lost love, friend turning on friend, and a broken and misguided \"king.\" Sean Penn pulled off his character, as only Sean Penn could have done, and profoundly deserved the Oscar he received.

A great film requires willing and continuous suspension of disbelief and empathy for the characters. SPOILERBut something goes terribly wrong here, when poor, previously-abused Dave suddenly becomes far less rational than he would have had to be to get to the point in his life where the 'mystery' takes place. Worse, his wife --Celeste -- appears not to know him at all. Perhaps her situation is that she took the only guy available to her because of some secret in her past or weakness of character, but how you have a 10+ year relationship with someone and not know their character... that requires some explanation. Maybe Lehane's book gives the background that is such a gaping wound in the film's continuity and credibility, but the sharp turn in which Celeste turns into a frightened and hostile betrayer took me right out of the movie.Much has been made of Penn's work and Robbins' work -- and that's appropriate. I felt Linney was a bit weak here in a Lady MacBeth part, but that could be the thin writing. And there's another surprise, because Helgeland brought the 'unfilmable' L.A. Confidential to the screen in such a magnificent way. So figuring out how a film with such potential could go so horribly wrong is a matter of some forensic pathology, and -- for me -- all signs point to the director.",

            "content": "Perhaps Mel Gibson should be crying foul at all the negative attention he's gotten when he can easily point to Clint Eastwood's `Mystic River' as a film with perhaps a dimmer view of a religious culture, this one Catholicism. Expertly using a variety of sacred icons, Eastwood's harrowing tale (based on a Dennis Lehane novel, unread) of the interaction between three childhood friends who cross paths after the murder of one of their children finds its true culprit in the systematic repression and abuse of children and women by their faith. Perhaps unsettled by current events, Eastwood, through Tom Stern's careful cinematography, can barely conceal his rage: the gliding camera consistently pans upwards to the sky, seemingly searching for answers but coming to the conclusion that love in the Catholic Church has been perverted into cruelty and discrimination (presided over by an indifferent God). Usually Eastwood the director exerts direct control over his emotions but here it's impossible not to be aware of the moral revulsion of a man shaken of his convictions and his anguish as he reacts to the world around him. The performances are nothing short of astounding: as the grieving, vengeful father of a murdered daughter, Sean Penn is alternately moving and terrifying and delivers an emotionally thorough performance; Tim Robbins, as the abused child grown into a shattered adult--and the instant natural suspect--abandons his usual smugness and, by deliberately underplaying, galvanizes; and Kevin Bacon, the friend who has become the detective on the case, is intelligent and complicated as a man haunted by memories of a childhood altered by a single, horrifying act and how that act has affected his ability to connect with the wife who has left him; the women, played flawlessly by Marcia Gay Harden and Laura Linney, represent both extremes of where their faith has relegated them, with Harden rejected by it and Linney brainwashed by its male supremacy. The script by Brian Helgeland is a model of concision. A masterpiece--perhaps, when all is said and done, this decade's most potent commentary.",

What is strange, many of you here don't like the ending which seems to be untrue and strange. I was even misled by the movie magazine that presented some irrational explanation of the final scene (Penn's talk with his wife and the parade)that turned out to be completely pointless after I saw the film.It's, of course, my personal opinion but everything necessary to understand it is covered in the film's tagline: We bury our sins, we wash them clean. There is no catharsis in this movie. Nobody seems to change one's life or admit to one's sins. Everything is hidden and deliberately forgotten. The characters clearly need the feeling of stability in their life. After the storm the sun must rise. Linney's character lives with supportive husband and two daughters. The daughters need their father, the wife needs her husband. The dark days are over now - there comes a time to rest and forget. She simply defends the family from collapsing at the same time disclosing the sad but true character of humans reaction. We don't have to agree with her but there is a truth in her attitude. Penn's character in the scene of the murder also wants to believe that he has the right person despite the fact that there is no hard evidence. He immediately wants to finish everything and knows only one solution. The waiting is killing him and he wants to believe that this night everything is to end. The film comes to the shocking point of humans' emotional character - when sth beautiful - pure, strong love to the beloved daugther is the main reason of sth horrible - it leads the murder.And the scene of parade - \"light-hearted\" Americans are watching the parade - children are laughing, music is playing, sun is shining and the whole afternoon seems almost idyllic. All the secrets and dark events are buried and the characters can start to pretend in front of everyone than nothing happened although it's a mystery for us what's happening in their souls. Very pessimistic and anti-hollywood film that uses the typical themes of abuse,loss in the family and vengeance and mix them into a new, intense movie quality with deep and captivating performances. I don't believe in Academy Awards anymore but still I do hope that they will notice everything that Eastwood put into his latest effort and the film will gather the well-deserved collection of oscars.10/10",

Mystic River was robbed of many Oscars, especially Best Direction, as I believe Clint Eastwood has created a dark, harrowing tale of innocence lost, and the pain that will always come out of death and tragedy. Tim Robbins... The best character in the film, is sublime as Dave Boyle, a man who in his childhood was subjected to awful experiences at the hands of a malevolent abductor. Sean Penn... The winner of the coveted 2003 Best Actor Oscar, for which I think he deserved, only because Tim was categorised as mere support, but really I think this is a dubious categorisation. If Tim had been in the Best Actor nomination category, he'd have walked away with it. Nonetheless, Penn plays Jimmy Markum, one of Dave's childhood buddies, who watched as he was taken away. Sean Penn does have genuine acting flair in his part. Kevin Bacon plays Sean Devine the other childhood buddy who watched Dave get taken as well. The story however is not about childhood, as you probably gathered as each Tim, Sean and Kevin are all over thirty years old. In fact the film is set years after the tragedy, with the events looming upon each of them, like some dark figure. This event is echoed to each of them via names written in cement, and drains that sucked in hockey balls during their childhood games on the streets, and they often relive the sight of Dave in the back seat of his abductors car looking out at them as he is taken away. Of course there is an aura of mystery behind the now grown-up Dave Boyle. He has a rather gentle way about him, which is also enigmatic. He stutters, indicating he has some sort of long, deep-planted memory of what happened in the dark, dank cellar of his kidnapper long long ago. Okay... Cut to the chase... The film doesn't dwell on this, it just lingers. The three no longer have anything more than a quick nodded 'hello' to offer when they meet each other. Jimmy owns a convenience store, and is plagued with a previous jail sentence and criminal life he'd like to forget. Sean is a homicide detective. and Dave... Well he's got his life sorted, he's got a nice wife and a son whom he loves dearly... Sounds like everything is fine. Wrong. The film is actually a 'whodunit' and the victim is Jimmy's nineteen year old daughter, Katie. This one event brings the three together. Jimmy is obviously the caring father who has sworn to God, to kill the person who killed his daughter. Sean is the homicide detective trying to figure out who's done it, and Dave... well he's a suspect. The film is dark, sleepy, very in-depth and very dramatic piece.

The ladies are also good, but their roles are supporting and not critical. I thought Linney handled her role with much more subtlety and believability than did Harden. My main reaction to the movie overall is 'atmospheric'. The viewer is always aware of the mood, and it is filmed almost without color. Black, whites, muted grays, blues, and browns predominate. I don't recall seeing any bright colors at all, except maybe for a store sign or two. The story involves a murder and the investigation to solve it. Here the \"process\" has much more impact than the final result. The movie has lots of realistic but foul language, but no nudity and very little violence. The tough decisions we have to make!SPOILERS FOLLOW, please proceed with caution. The story begins in an Irish Boston neighborhood, maybe 25 years earlier, three 11-year-old friends are playing street hockey and, led by Jimmy, begin to write their names in fresh concrete. Two men posing as cops show up, talk Dave into getting in their car, he is held captive in a cellar for four days, molested by the men, until he escapes but is never the same. As grown men with families, Sean (Bacon) has become the police investigator, Jimmy (Penn) as an ex-con runs a corner store, Dave (Robbins) is a handyman and his brooding demeanor is certainly a tie to his molestation as a young boy of 11. Jimmy's daughter Katie turns up murdered, Jimmy gets his own thug friends to help \"investigate\", while Sean and his partner, Whitey, set out to solve the crime. Dave becomes a suspect because he comes home late the same night, cut and bloody, claiming to have been in an altercation with a mugger. In the end we see Jimmy getting a tip from Dave's wife, she thinks he is the killer, Jimmy as the judge and his two thugs as the jury, knife and shoot Dave at the Mystic riverbank and dump his body. \"A king has to do whatever it takes to protect his family.\" But the next day he finds that the murder was caused by two kids playing with a gun, accidentally shooting Katie, then chasing and killing her to silence her.",

On the surface it appears to be about the three men and their innocence lost mixed in with ideas about power, retribution and family bonds. The women in mystic river are in fact arguably the more integral part Annabeth, cold in her manner seems to support whatever Jimmy does, she seems ruthless. Celeste seems to be losing her husband and turns from one of the most stable to the most unstable from start to finish and Sean's wife leaves him at breaking point whilst navigating the case.

            "content": "**POSSIBLE SPOILERS**We need more films like Mystic River.  Nowadays, when Hollywood is full of mindless, popcorn movies, Clint Eastwood takes us back to when good stories and great acting was the blueprint of a good movie.  I love Clint Eastwood for his 'human' films; note some of his past works such as Unforgiven, Blood Work & Absolute Power.  He always gives his audience a humble, down-to-Earth film when he directs.  Mystic River works because of this quality more than anything.  Unlike someone like Michael Bay (notably Bad Boys 2), he doesn't get too full of himself where he has to pour himself, his 'style' and his 'signature' into a movie.  He steps back and simply tells a human story; and the beauty of that is a sight to behold and greatly appreciated by me.The acting in Mystic River drives it.  An all-star cast to say the least, Sean Penn gives a masterful performance; balancing the two sides of his character flawlessly.  On one side is the former criminal who still has some ties to his past, and on the other is the honorable father who would do anything for family.  Tim Robbins was cast perfectly as the trouble Dave; only he could've given the little nuances he did to add so much to the character, like his facial expressions.  Kevin Bacon, who I neither love or hate, played his part very well; subtle enough to portray the hard-nosed cop and grieving soon-to-be divorcee perfectly.  Laurence Fishburne, although its always nice to see him, didn't really need to be here; anyone could've played his role.  Oscar talk has surfaced, and rightfully so; Sean Penn definitely has my vote for Best Actor.  Tim Robbins could very well win Best Supporting Actor, he was excellent.  Mystic River is great because of the statement it gives... taking us back to the days of films like The Godfather, Apocalypse Now and Goodfellas.  It serves as a reminder to us skeptics that there still is great talent out there regardless of the overabundance of garbage put out constantly.  A good movie can indeed be made without CGI, explosions and slo-mo gun battles....just great actors and a riveting story.  THIS is why the critics have raved about Mystic River; its a good old-fashioned 'movie' without all the extras.  Mystic River is a masterpiece in my eyes, and I would be highly disappointed if it's not recognized at the Oscars, particularly Sean Penn. One of the best films of 2003.*** 1/2 out of **** stars.",

            "content": "I was quite underwhelmed by this film. There are many who consider this to be among the greatest films to be created by director Clint Eastwood, on the level of 'Unforgiven' or 'Gran Torino'. I sadly did not see a great film here, I mostly saw a decent but ultimately flawed and uninspired character drama.Firstly, the films biggest asset is it's cast of actors. Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, Kevin Bacon and Lawrence Fishburne all give great performances and it is quite interesting to see their varied acting styles interact. Tim Robbins probably gives the most impressive performance here, totally worthy of an Academy Award. However, the acting is dragged down by an uninspired and formulaic script. Many of the lines are tedious and clich\u00e9', and others are almost nonsensical and stupid. This does not apply for every exchange, however it is prominent enough to be an annoyance.The plot is fairly standard fare. There are no shocking twists or particularly daring ways of presenting the story here. It is far from incompetent or laughable, however it almost becomes boring in it's predictability. The film's strongest narrative feature is it's solid pacing, allowing the actors room to showcase their acting talent, in fact much of the film appears centred around creating the perfect conditions for these actors to demonstrate their talents. The film's pacing is sadly ruined towards the end, when the film's plot is wrapped up and an overlong epilogue sequence does it's best to ruin as much of the good which came before as possible. Not only in terms of pacing, but also in terms of character and the film's thematic content, This ending was quite terrible and did much to destroy the film for me, specifically the moronic 'King' monologue.The cinematography and set design is very nice, nothing outstanding but defiantly strong. It has a very well defined look and can get downright gorgeous at times, specifically in it's impressively shot opening sequence. However this good visual work is often undermined by a poorly used and highly repetitive soundtrack. Often wildly out of place with the actions on screen, and sounding quite cheap and melodramatic in places.Overall, although the performances are good, I was quite underwhelmed by this picture. I could not look past it's gaping flaws and did not find it much above decent.",

            "content": "Greetings again from the darkness.  I walked out of this movie feeling cheated. It had almost nothing to do with \"Mystic River\", but everything to do with Sean Penn.  This guy is such a great actor that I feel cheated he doesn't work more often.  He is Deniro from 15-20 years ago, before Deniro started parodying himself (SNL and Meet the Parents). Director Clint Eastwood delivers what we have come to expect from him - a wonderfully crafted, beautiful film that we mostly surrender to from our theatre seats.  Eastwood's style make you feel like you are a passenger on a car trip, watching as things happen outside your window.  \"Mystic River\" is not a whodunnit, as the answer to that question is given away very early on. What it is a study in human frailty, no matter the form.  The 3 childhood friends grow to be quite different adults, yet the horrific incident they share, is the foundation for who they have become.  While Sean Penn should act more often, I believe Tim Robbins (a fine filmmaker in his own right) should act less.  In goes through his role as some psycho-Herman Munster. Yes, he is tortured by the childhood incident, but if reality is such a foreign place to him, wouldn't his wife or co-workers have suggested therapy?  His role, while crucial to the film, had the weakest structure and performance.  Kevin Bacon and Sean Penn, on the other hand, shine in their roles.  For one of the few times, Bacon is not playing some freak that we love to hate.  Eastwood (in the Woody Allen tradition) has assembled a cast of acting professionals.  Laurence Fishburne, Laura Linney and Marcia Gay Harden all lend realism to their tough roles.  Spencer Treat Clark (the kid from \"Unbreakable\" and \"Gladiator\") has a key role without uttering a word. What a joy to see Eli Wallach (Eastwood's buddy from \"The Good, The Bad and The Ugly) as the liquor store owner and witness to a past crime ... although he should have been listed in the credits!  Bottom line on this one, enjoy as a personality study and beautiful film and not a murder whodunnit.",

Very powerful screen presence and so much emotion without the hystronics of lessor actors.  The next thing is that this is no whodunnit!  The answer to that is given away very early in the process, so for me it became a study of blue collar northeastern family and friendship. Very strong ties for this area.  No other geographic part of the U.S. compares.  Watching the Savage brothers \"serve\" Penn's character is chilling, all the while knowing he would do the same for them, if the tables were turned.  Other than the lack of suspense for the killer, the film's next biggest flaw is Timothy Robbins.  He tromps around like a psycho-Herman Munster.  I never believe this is a grown-up version of the boy who survived the tragic childhood incident.  In every scene, Robbins is over the top and almost laughably awful.  The incident itself actually seems secondary to how the 3 boys grow into adults.  What could have been the defining storyline is actually a weakness in the script.  All that said, Clint Eastwood again directs a beautiful piece of filmmaking.  His pace, color and music is near incomparable.  Only Scorcese is better.  First movie in awhile where Kevin Bacon is actually not some idiot in an unbelievable situation.  As a police detective, he turns in a very realistic cop in a tough situation.  His partner, Laurence Fishburne, is at times too aggressive, but it plays well against Bacon's pent up frustration with the case and his wife.   What a joy to see Eli Wallach (Clint's buddy from The Good, The Bad and The Ugly) as a years-later witness to a liquor store hold-up.  Spencer Treat Clark (the kid from Unbreakable and Gladiator) has a key non-speaking role and Marcia Gay Harden performs well as the what to do wife of Robbin's character. Although, seemingly out of place, I really enjoyed super-actress Laura Linney's final two scenes.  The bedroom scene with Sean Penn was very powerful and her exceedingly cold stare down of Harden at the parade gave me the willies!!  It almost seems there must have been another Linney scene left on the cutting room floor, as her character gave no indication of this inner strength prior to this.  Overall, another well made Eastwood movie with a weak script and terrific acting by Penn and Linney.",

Dave becomes the victim of child molestation, and grows up being paranoid. Sean grows up to be a detective. Jimmy grows up to have a daughter. After Jimmy's daughter is murdered, Sean is on the case, and suspects Dave.Here is a warning for all you viewers who are ready to watch it. Mystic River is not a light film. Mystic River is a dark tragedy about murder, paranoia and suspicion. Even the scenery has a dark a feel to it. It looks like the cameraman put something dark over the lens to make the scenery seem more gray. The characters all talk very quietly most of the time (put on captions if you can) and all have childhood secrets hidden in them.Sean, Jimmy and Dave are all well-crafted and deep characters. That's a necessary addition to this film.Sean, Dave and Jimmy slowly learn to mistrust each other and the outcome is dramatic and tragic. The darkness slowly embraces you, and let you get a feel for the film. It takes the tragedy of a single death, and lets it cause a whole lot of pain and trouble.

While playing in the street as kids, one of them is abducted and sexually abused for days. As adults they've drifted apart. Jimmy (Sean Penn) is a reformed con who runs a successful market when his daughter is suddenly murdered (Emmy Rossum). Sean (Kevin Bacon) investigates the murder with his partner, Whitey (Laurence Fishburne), with evidence eventually pointing toward Dave (Timothy Bottoms), the one who was abducted. Marcia Gay Harden plays Dave's anxious spouse while Laura Linney plays Jimmy's loyal wife.This is similar in tone & theme to the melancholy \"Sleepers\" (1996), but less episodic and more dramatically gripping. The movie has the confidence to take its time and flesh-out the characters. It's a psychological crime drama that works as both a whodunit and a tragedy. The intrinsic problems of vigilante justice are cogently illustrated.Some people have misinterpreted the movie because they missed some things. For instance, they criticize the curious Lady Macbeth-like monologue of Annabeth (Linney) at the end. But watch the movie again, pay close attention, and the answers are there. I'd say more, but I don't want to give anything away (you're welcome to write me if you'd like some insights).\"Mystic River\" is not something that can be casually watched; it's a deep drama with three-dimensional characters, potently exploring several intriguing issues: How abuses of the past affect the present; the danger of hiding recesses of your psyche; the folly of not getting spiritual help for deep-rooted psychological concerns; disloyalty/loyalty; doing the wrong thing for the right reasons; jumping to wrong conclusions based on dubious info; houses divided cannot stand; the importance of encouraging one's spouse for the sake of familial health & survival; \"king of the castle\"; etc.The film runs 2 hours, 18 minutes and was shot in Boston.GRADE: A",

The story gets its name from the Mystic River that runs through the Northwest of the city and empties into Boston Harbor.From an opening short scene of boyhood, the movie quickly jumps 25 years. Three boyhood friends have drifted apart, with far different lives. One is an ex-con who's become a king of the old neighborhood in which he owns a mom and pop grocery store. Another is a homicide detective. And the third is a blue-collar worker who still suffers quietly from sexual abuse as a boy at the hands of two men. One wore the Roman collar of a priest, the other was a plain-clothes policeman. The boy was abducted for four days. This incident isn't discussed any more in the film, but it comes back in a big way in the events that follow these many years later.Clint Eastwood co-produced, directed and wrote the score for this film. It has his mark of a dark side of life. It's a story about dysfunctional families, child abuse, crime, hatred, homosexuality, murder, revenge, teen prostitution, vengeance and secrets. The film is a furtive look at vigilante justice, blind revenge, distrust of innocence, criminal denial of guilt and injustice.It's a powerful, sad film that ends without resolution. This has become a trademark of Eastwood films. He brings a story to an end, but the characters will go on living without a satisfactory conclusion to the story. This is a hard movie to sit through for its violence, meanness, and frequent obscenities and vulgar language. The R rating fits, except that it might have another label - for mature adults. This is the type of film that can badly influence immature adults as well as young people.The acting is superb throughout the film. Sean Penn and Tim Robbins received double awards - Oscars and Golden Globes, for their roles.

That's precisely what you get in \"Mystic River\", a straight-up Eastwood masterwork that boasts of deep cinematic passion and incredible storytelling.

Thinking they might be police officers, Dave gets into their car when the two angrily insist while Jimmy and Sean are left helplessly watching him go. Dave gets sexually abused by the two men for four days until he escapes.Many years later, the three of them have grown apart and have married. Jimmy (Sean Penn), an ex-con, runs a convenience store at the end of the street. He's helped by his nineteen-year old daughter Katie (Emmy Rossum). Katie's secretly dating Brendan (Tom Guiry), a boy Jimmy despises. The two make plans to elope to Las Vegas but Katie gets murdered the night before.Dave (Tim Robbins), now married and having a son, is still haunted by his predicament. A quiet character, he's in the middle of an unhappy marriage. When he returns home with blood on his shirt on the night of Katie's murder, his wife Celeste (Marcia Gay Harden) questions him about it. When he tells her a story of having fought off and possibly killed a mugger, she doesn't believe him. The news of the murder leaks out and she suspects him of having killed Katie. Sean (Kevin Bacon) is divorced from his wife and is now a police detective. He's handed the case of Katie's murder but tries his best not to let his relationships with the people involved in it get in his way.Unlike most of Eastwood's movies, \"Mystic River\" doesn't beat about the bush and plunges straight into the action. Acutely observed from the very first frame, the first sequence is deeply unsettling. Set mostly in an Irish neighborhood, Eastwood effectively creates a moody, suspenseful atmosphere when the two men delude the gullible boys. And that atmosphere persists throughout the movie. Because it's about the characters more than it's about the plot, a considerable amount of time is devoted to richly detail the life that goes on for the three protagonists. Screenwriter Brian Helgeland writes solicitously, etching out the characters so wonderfully that you get enough time socialize with them. Though a lot goes on in \"Mystic River\", it's a rather quiet examination of guilt and redemption and the drama that unfolds when the circumstances play their part in the lives of the characters. Eastwood crucially chooses pragmatism over drama, which is a relief considering that's not the case with most movies that we get to see now.One of the cavils I have with this beauty of a movie is that it's slow in its revelations. Most of the time I found myself guessing correctly what's about to transpire but the characters seemed too poky to keep up. Though the suspense was ultimately well-crafted, I would've preferred to be kept guessing till the very end.\"Mystic River\" largely benefits from the magnificent performances which the whole cast uniformly delivers. Penn is cogent, radiating his tremendous potential as an actor through the livid Jimmy. Robbins is fantastic, playing a quiet, hurting father, you can't help but be sympathetic for his plight. Harden, in a brief role, hands in a nuanced, sensitive performance as a wife torn between her husband and a need for justice. Bacon does a pretty good job of turning Sean into a forceful personality that strangely gives you a lot of hope. In a film that's about guilt, Sean's the only symbol of hope. \"Mystic River\" may be Eastwood's best work. It's a supremely well-directed, commiserative, observant drama that's completely bereft of film tricks. Here's a movie made with feeling that relies solely on its material to tell a good story. It's a riveting film that engages you and then smothers you with its power. Terrific.",

            "content": "Mystic River (2003) is a movie that I recently rewatched for the first time in a long time on HBOMAX. The storyline follows a group of friends who went through a traumatic experience as kids when one of the friends is kidnapped and something terrible happens. Now the kids, as adults, still reside in the same neighborhood making a living how they see fit - one as a shop owner, one as a detective and one doing everyday activities. The shop owner's daughter disappears creating a web of mystery, uncertainty and doubt among the neighborhood and friends.This movie is directed by Clint Eastwood (Gran Torino) and stars Sean Penn (21 Grams), Tim Robbins (Shawshank Redemption), Kevin Bacon (Friday the 13th), Laurence Fishburne (The Matrix) and Laura Linney (Ozark).The storyline for this is intricate and contains dynamic characters. The cast is impressive with Bacon, Penn and Robbins delivering outstanding performances. The character portrayal and how it evolves over time is impressive. The cinematography is well done and there is a persistent dark cloud over the movie from beginning to end. The storyline is both a character piece and a \"who done it.\" The ending is absolutely unbelievable and leaves you feeling empty inside...much like Tim Robbins character.Overall, this is an absolute masterpiece that is perfectly put together. I would score this a 10/10 and strongly recommend it.",

            "content": "***SPOILERS*** If you haven't seen the movie please skip this comment ***SPOILERS***Mystic River is at once a beautiful thing to see, but a horrible thing to think about. I truly enjoy these psychological drama mysteries, and a little whodunnit goes a long way with me. However, despite this films' beautiful scenery and camera work, the overall effect was wasted by one of the most empty stories stuffed with over-acting and pointless symbolism I've ever had the misfortune to be abused by.First of all, the film tries to evoke the power of the river - mystic, references to washing clean, sins, penitence - yet the river itself plays nary a cameo in the overall story. It's kind of somewhere nearby, and maybe we use it to hide a body once in awhile.Next, the whodunnit. It's obviously not Dave Boyle. I could almost hear the storyteller whispering \"ignore the characters' viewpoint, look at what I'm *not* telling you\". Boyle's wife starts suspecting him immediately, apparently with no real reason other than it just might have happened, yet we have no precursive reference upon which to base an agreement with her conclusion, so she comes off as weak-minded, also a trait we have not had defined for us in our brief let's-meet-the-characters-grown-up teaser sequences. There's a weak, vague leap from Dave as molestee to Dave as murderer, but why kill Katie? At exactly 61 minutes I happened to pause the DVD for a coffee break and remarked that it seemed obvious that Jimmy was going to kill Dave and then find out Dave didn't do it. Which is a great tragedy, and had it happened 62 minutes into the film I might have enjoyed the drama that could unfold following such a horrific moment in Jimmy's personal life and the effect his mistake would have on the relatively interwoven community, but instead we're treated to yet another contrived suspense thriller where the wrong guy gets it just as the real bad guy is unmasked. Yeh, I haven't seen that before. Even worse, as it turns out, we can't even feel sorry for Dave as the wrong guy because even though he didn't kill Katie, he's becoming a likely candidate for serial killer of the month, getting his first kill in, coincidentally enough, the night his friends' daughter gets killed.The premise is ridiculously fantastical, the plot is full of holes, this tragedy is a comedy of errors.After jumping from guesses that included the Savage brothers, the Harris widow and for a few minutes, Sean himself, the 911 tape gave us the answer. Something about the whispering screamed \"mute brother\". We'd already been treated to the 911 call at the start of the film, and there's an obvious weirdness to the \"they want a name\", \"they want our name\", \"they want her name\" business.***So, if we the audience are supposed to receive this movie as a psychological exploration for which the story is not that important, maybe we can salvage some value. Maybe the plot is not so important; the premise contrived merely to allow the various psyches to unfurl before us for our perusal and dissection. Yet the movie is inundated with apparent stupidity and weird leaps of unexplained behaviour, denying us the intellectual stimulation it could have so easily given us.1. If I can guess Sean is sending the money to the Harris widow, why can't two ostensibly adequate homicide detectives?2. Celeste Boyle who has been married to Dave for quite some time can't notice her husband having some kind of breakdown? She can't talk to her husband, but she can run down the street and confess her beliefs to Jimmy like some bad scene from a thankfully-never-made Mafia movie?3. Sean's wife. I'm struggling to explain why she's even in there, maybe the trinity needed balance, maybe someone thought we the audience didn't want Sean left out of having a crappy life so here's some drama. And what's with the mouth? Am I supposed to see her as Sean now sees her, as only a voice, no substantiality? Could work in another movie, but in a whodunnit it simply immediately casts suspicion on the character for which we hover between indecision until finally Sean picks up a photo of the departed wife so we can breathe a little easier, knowing it's not one of the already on screen women and furthermore, she's not the killer because she looks so damn cute in the picture. I can imagine the meeting after the test audience overwhelmingly decided it was her. \"Hmm, how about we throw a photo in and she looks all beautiful and innocent and Sean looks happy and hey, we trust him so she must be innocent\".4. Jimmy has what exactly to base his decision to execute his childhood friend? That's right. NOTHING. Dave was in the bar everyone normally goes to. Dave came home bloody. Kill Dave. Sure, if they had some kind of history of dislike, or even no history at all, I could buy it, but they were childhood buddies. I'd need a little more myself.5. Dave has guilt over killing the wrong guy for about four and a half hours. Then he bangs his wife after she does some weird you're-the-king-and-you-can-kill-whoever-you-want-to speech, which is in and of itself ridiculous and completely out of character for her.6. Sean as trustworthy: \"he's not my friend\", that's what we get given to allow us to consider Sean as the font of all truth, wisdom and impartiality. Anyone catching on to this who has not yet realized Dave is innocent of Katie's murder can now rest assured because Sean sure as hell doesn't think so, and not because he's Dave's friend or anything. 7. Dave being driven away twice. Just how sorry are we supposed to be for him? What are we supposed to draw from his second \"abduction\", even down to the hand coming over the seat when the passenger turns around. And that first time in the car... was that a cross on the guy's ring? Surely that's not a priest? In Boston? Molesting boys? Wow, who'd a thunk it?8. The two who didn't get in the car. Feel guilt. Don't feel guilt. Feel guilt again. Don't feel guilt. Feel a little teensy bit of guilt.9. Dave. Stick to a story. Was it the door or was it the kitchen sink? Both exclude the fake un-back-up-able mugger, why make up a new one for the cops? You already told Jimmy you jammed it in a door. Who would move from that story? Not including Dave, no-one.***So maybe we can forget all that and watch the anachronisms, the out of character-ness they display as this second trauma impacts these three, drawing them all back together. Maybe. Unfortunately, we know so damned little about them, we don't even know what to think past the typecasting.Come on! Develop these characters before having them do uncharacteristic things. At least then we'd have a better sense of who's acting out of whack.Is Jimmy acting out of character whacking friends? Apparently not, he's done it before. If he was out of character maybe we could sympathize with his relentless need to kill someone, anyone, even on not too great a corpus of evidence, but the jail-time, the tattoos, the \"is that my daughter in there\" screaming... no, Jimmy's doing what Jimmy would always do.Is Dave out of character being all moody and weird? Nope, he's like that from the minute we meet him. He's obviously spiralling near something bad, but was it really triggered by randomly walking past the drainhole and cement? Or has he been getting worse every day since the escape? We sure as hell don't know.Does Sean even have character? Hardly.Then the wives.Jimmy's wife completely crazies out in the ending, including the afore-mentioned weird support pep-talk plus the oddball side glances she gives Dave's wife in the last scene. Dave's wife? We have no idea. Maybe she's always thought Dave was a little weird and now finally he's gone and done something she can blab about. Sean's wife? Who the hell knows?***If there's a lesson in this film with all the happy endings and weird look-at-them-all-being-completely-normal-despite-the-most-insanely-messed-up-day-they-all-had-yesterday imagery, I didn't get it.Eastwood took an amazingly poor story and made a beautiful film. Kudos. I highly recommend seeing this film, just so you can experience the same sweet and sour brain damage I suffered watching this overlong madness.",

            "content": "The Mystic River (which plays a part in the film) is a river which flows into Boston Harbour; the name derives from an Amerindian language and has nothing to do with mysticism.In 1975, three teenage friends, Jimmy, Sean and Dave, are playing in a Boston street when two men drive up in a car, force Dave to get in with them, and drive off. (We later learn that they are paedophiles and that they kidnapped Dave in order to abuse him sexually). The main part of the film is set twenty-five years later. Jimmy, who has a criminal record, is now the owner of a grocery store. Sean is a detective with the police and Dave is a blue-collar worker. The plot revolves around the murder of Jimmy's teenage daughter Katie; Sean and his partner are tasked with investigating the killing and Dave is one of the suspects. Because of its complexity there is not space in this review to set the plot out in much greater detail. Dave, however, is not the only suspect in the case; ballistics evidence seems to link the killing to the family of Katie's boyfriend Brendan Harris, whose father Ray was once a criminal associate of Jimmy.The film has been described as an example of neo-noir, the genre which uses modern cinema techniques in order to produce a contemporary equivalent of the classic films noirs of the forties and fifties. Such films generally have complex plots based on crime and wrongdoing and mostly lack a clean-cut hero; even those characters who are on the right side of the law are often surrounded by a sense of moral ambiguity. They may lack the moody, expressionist black-and-white photography of the traditional noir- neo-noirs are almost always in colour- but their directors often try hard to find an equivalent. For example Polanski's \"Chinatown\" sometimes regarded as the first neo-noir, is dominated by the hard, glaring light of a hot, dry California summer, and Lawrence Kasdan brings to \"Body Heat\" a colour scheme dominated by blacks, reds and oranges in order to emphasise the feelings of heat and passion which lie at the heart of that film. Here Clint Eastwood takes a contrasting approach; his palette is dominated by dull greys and blues in keeping with the gritty urban streets against which the action takes place and the commonplace, often squalid, lives of his characters. (The multi-talented Eastwood not only directed, but also received his first composer credit for the musical score).This was Eastwood's twenty-fifth film as director, but only the third which he directed but in which he did not act. (The first two were \"Bird\" and \"Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil\"). He doubtless felt that there was no suitable role for him; he would have been 73 in 2003, and all the leading characters are, at most, in their forties or younger. (He had recently been criticised for casting himself in roles, in \"True Crime\" and \"Blood Work\", which should really have gone to younger actors). He was able, however, to bring out some excellent acting performances from his cast. There are too many to single them all out, but I must say that both Sean Penn (\"Best Actor\") and Tim Robbins (\"Best Supporting Actor\") thoroughly deserved their Oscar victories. (This was the first film to take both these awards since \"Ben-Hur\" in 1959).Robbins's Dave and Penn's Jimmy are both haunted by the incident from 1975, Dave for obvious reasons, Jimmy by guilt for having failed to prevent it. Jimmy may be an ex-criminal- indeed, not necessarily \"ex\" because he maintains his links with the underworld- but he still has a powerful sense of justice and believes that the killing of his daughter needs to be paid for in blood. Dave may seem like a shambling, inarticulate figure, but he too has rage in his heart and his own ideas for taking revenge for what happened to him as a boy. Other fine contributions come from Kevin Bacon as Sean and Marcia Gay Harden as Dave's wife Celeste.In some ways \"Mystic River\" reminded me of \"The Godfather\". There are of course differences. \"The Godfather\" is a grand epic of American crime, with the Corleone family as a criminal aristocracy, whereas the working-class characters of \"Mystic River\" are much lower down the food-chain, involved not in large-scale organised crime but in, at most, petty hold-ups of liquor stores. On the other hand, there are also similarities. Marlon Brando's Vito Corleone may be a bad man, but he is also in a way a magnificent one, and, strangely, the same can be said of Penn's Jimmy, even though he is involved in crime at a much lower level. At the end of the film his wife Annabeth, who knows what he has done, tells him that he is \"a king, and a king knows what to do and does it. Even when it's hard\".Eastwood, however, never glamourises crime. Although this sort of crime committed by the Jimmys of this world might be dismissed by the police and the media as \"petty\", it can still have grave consequences. As in \"The Godfather\", one criminal act can spiral out of control in unforeseen ways, affecting the innocent as well as the guilty. The film is pervaded by the stench of evil in the same way as the Mystic River, in which one character's body is dumped, is pervaded by the stench of pollution. A fine return to form by Eastwood after the disappointing \"Blood Work\". 8/10.",

            "content": "I've worked in South Boston, the setting for Clint Eastwood's moody `Mystic River.'  His creation is tidier than I remember, yet he infuses that working-class world with an undercurrent of violence and revenge that I remember more on the surface and at least avoidable.  In this film, the sins of parents and the wrongs of childhood follow relentlessly into adulthood. Eastwood has a classic here, a piece of tragic Americana more real and stunningly poignant than `American Beauty' in its expressionism and `Deer Hunter' in its realism.Sean Penn, Kevin Bacon, and Tim Robbins were all forever changed when as kids Robbins was abducted and abused for several days.  Decades later Penn's daughter is murdered and the abused Robbins emerges as a suspect. The plot details are filled with twists enough to keep interest but stretch believability for the purists not interested in slavish adherence to the novel.  Although those purists might have liked a different conclusion, and this weakness could keep `Mystic River' from immortality, they will have a hard time denying that this ensemble is the best acting this year or almost any other for that matter. Penn's determination to revenge leaves Uma Thurman from `Kill Bill' still kicking up her heels far behind him in acting chops.Sean Penn's vindictive father steps back from overacting, opting rather for the crooked lip or darting eye to telegraph his certainty that he will punish his daughter's murderer. When he says,  ''We bury our sins, and wash them clean,'' you feel he may be able to make that maxim so.  Kevin Bacon's state trooper detective is as taut as this body, unfortunately having to put up with the script silliness of his ex-wife's mute calls at unpredictable hours, Eastwood and novelist Dennis Lehane's attempt to parallel in a subplot the loss inherent in the major action. Tim Robbins' deteriorating character is a brilliant piece of understatement, which relies on baggy vacant eyes to show the hurt and anger still crying from his youth.Although Eastwood may have a more enduring classic in `Unforgiven,'  `Mystic River' is far superior to his recent `Blood Work' and Midnight in the Garden of good and Evil.' If for nothing else it will remind you how much your childhood is still in your life and how much unparalleled acting can transform a mediocre plot into the almost sublime.",

            "content": "Clint Eastwood's Mystic River is a richly crafted picture by a director who has churned out more great films than many new directors probably will in their lifetime. Give the man a script, he'll work wonders, or give the man a camera, and he'll make wonders. His dedicated, sensitive look at human sympathy, grief, and emotion colors in the extensively detailed and professionally acted meat that makes up the entire film. This isn't another lame \"whodunit\" drama, but a moving and impressive detective epic.The story focuses on three friends, Jimmy, Sean, and Dave, who grew up in a Boston neighborhood, where they spent their days playing hockey in the streets. One day, they are caught scribbling their names into wet concrete by a man who claims he is a police officer. He manipulates Dave into getting in the back of his car, and it turns out, the man is a child molester who keeps Dave captive for four days before he escapes.Fast-forward about thirty years later, and the men have drifted apart but remain in Boston. Jimmy (Sean Penn) is an ex-convict, with a wife and a nineteen year old daughter named Katie (Emmy Rossum), who he keeps extra close to him, while Dave (Tim Robbins), who too has a wife (Marcia Gay Harden) and son, is still distraught over his molestation and is left a very distant man.When Katie is murdered in cold-blood, their old friend Sean (Kevin Bacon), a local police detective, is hired to investigate, bringing along his partner (Laurence Fishburne). Sean has been long estranged from his wife, who calls frequently only to remain silent on the line.In the mix of this murder, Dave is one of the suspects, returning home from the shooting late at night equipped with a shaky alibi. He claims he can't always recall events perfectly. But the murder of Katie does one thing ostensibly favorable and that is it reunites three long lost friends. They all have lead pretty morose lives in one way or another and seemingly have all left their potential in a cloud of dust behind them.Eastwood, who does not show himself in the film, reminds us that he can still carefully examine characters and show us what they're worth. He paints them with elaborate strokes, ones that leave an impact on the viewer and not ones that are filler and instantaneously disposable. His bitter direction, depicting a cold, murky Boston, often raining and tinted with teal, is sublime and effective.Aesthetically, the film is composed from the ground up on a winning recipe. Penn gives a terrific performance, playing a man who is divided between restoring his life for his daughters and pursuing the life of spur-of-the-moment madness. Robbins is a gifted actor when handed the efficient material and he, just the same, immerses himself in the role of Dave, playing another character torn between sanity and a crippling reality.The film is photographed with eerily picture-esque images by Tom Stern, written with style and depth by Brian Helgeland (working from Dennis Lehane's novel of the same name), and is all captured masterfully under veteran Eastwood's direction. Through all the bitterness, despair, and angst, Mystic River remains a story about complicated human drama, the tedium, yet realism, of criminal investigations that are neither far- fetched or CSI-simple, and how human nature functions as a whole.Starring: Sean Penn, Kevin Bacon, Tim Robbins, Laurence Fishburne, Marcia Gay Harden, and Emmy Rossum.

I watched too many crap horror movies that try to scare you with their traditional shock recipes and they all fail, but the end scene where (the characters) Annabeth Markum stares at Celeste Boyle across the street with that deep knowing look is one of the most communicative, non-verbal scenes ever in any movie, and also amongst the most evil, it truly is scary!Dark indeed, and maybe the end scene is just a tad OTT/inconsistent with the rest of the plot, but it's still a very good movie.",

            "content": "Who said \"what doesn't kill you makes you stronger\"? Indeed, life is all about taking hits, but if often happens that the hits hurt less than the idea that we could have easily avoided some of them. A man crippled by a road accident might not blame his driving but what caused him to drive that very day. This 'thinking' can cripple a soul even worse than a body. \"Mystic River\", Clint Eastwood's minimalist masterpiece, is a harrowing odyssey over the lives of tortured souls affected directly or indirectly by tragedy and the cruel arbitrariness of life.The movie opens in blue-collar Boston quarters. Three kids: Dave, Sean and Jimmy are playing hockey on the road and sign their names in wet cement. Two men posing as cops approach them, they take Dave in the car, supposedly to send him to his parents and teach him a lesson. Whatever happens to Dave after and however it derailed the trajectory of his life is ominously suggested by the unfinished name in the cement. Sean and Jimmy were so close to their neighborhood that the two sexual predators didn't take any chances with them, but a piece of their soul went with Dave in that car, and the adults they'll turn out to be won't emerge totally unscathed from that 'incident'.\"Mystic River\" was adapted by Brian Helgeland from a novel by Dennis Lehane and the beauty in the screenplay lies in the way it doesn't fool us by offering answers, men's actions can be as irrational as life itself, but it allows us to grasp why sane people can act in irrational ways, making mistakes out of misguided instinct, past experiences or even love. Clint Eastwood is too much of a no-nonsense director to make a philosophical statement, we make the conclusions for ourselves and appreciate the film for what it is: a harrowing and poignant human drama, served by tremendous acting. Indeed, this is one of these films where the notion of acting ensemble isn't just some awards pundit's darling, even the most unnoticeable character can give you a taste of his life.And the taste never feels as authentic as when Sean Penn and Tim Robbins are in or share the screen, as adult Jimmy and Dave, they are the yin and the yang of \"Mystic River\", one has a heart so fueled in anger that it's like a ticking bomb waiting anytime to explode, and his friend carries such a heavy burden that it seems to push him down inside himself. Both actors are equally outstanding in performances that would be considered rather routine. Robbins' uncommunicative behavior speak a thousand words, while Penn\u0085 well, I've seen scenes of parents learning about the death of their children, but a few has struck me like Penn shouting \"is there my daughter there?\" and then simply surrendering to the madness of desperation and shouting. Some would call it over-the-top, it is not, rather over the edge, and when driven to that corner, there's no standard of behavior.The acting and the intensity of the drama make up for the gloomy banality of the location. And there's that hometown flavor, that authenticity conveyed by the story. Penn and Robbins also play married men with children, which is not just some dimension-adding plot device, it means that their character act like men, but also husbands and children, and as pivotal as the Oscar-winning performances of Penn and Robbins were, the wealth is spread to Marcia Gay Harden who plays Dave's wife and Laura Linney playing Jimmy's. \"Mystic River\" isn't just about a murder and the police investigation but the ensuing effect on families, about betrayal and loyalty, certitudes and suspicions following the murder of Jimmy's daughter Katie (Emmy Rossum). The procedural seems like \"good cop/ bad cop\" routine but even that aspect is handled by Eastwood like state-of-art filmmaking.The investigation is conducted by officers Whitey (Lawrence Fishburne) and Sean (Kevin Bacon). I only mention now the third acting force of the film, because Bacon doesn't play on the same emotional level than his two former friends. He also got his deal of marital troubles, but he tries not to let his past interfere with his judgment. Whitey finds there's something suspicious with Dave who saw Katie shortly before the murder and came back home with a bloody injury on his hand causing his wife, not only to be afraid, but to act afraid, publicly. Dave has a saying about the blood but the absence of proofs, his muddy talking and strange fascination for vampires accentuates his creepiness and slowly turns him into number one suspect. \"Mystic River\" is about people's lives intertwining within a tragedy of the present but while the past is sneakily resurfacing, causing an unfortunate streak of actions moved by tragic betrayals and ill-advised loyalty, crazy actions that only make sense within the realm of the opening incident. We're never totally clean, whatever that means. It is very revealing that while dealing with the grief of losing a daughter, Jimmy, who's been a former convict, recalls the childhood episode and the effects it could have had by harming his self-confidence (had he been in that car). Instead, he grew up strong enough to marry a beautiful woman and have Katie\u0085 and then, Katie was killed. There's a fine line between life questioning and intellectual masturbation. And assuming that Katie turned Jimmy into a better man wouldn't amount much in the scale of the actions he committed out of this very love.\"Mystic River\" doesn't call for analysis, it is as random as life itself, this is human drama at its rawest and most powerful intensity, directed by Clint Eastwood without any fancy storytelling, it is just things happening to people and people reacting to them. It might be random but it is possible (or is it certitude?) that the tragedy within the tragedy of life is its total randomness",

            "content": "\"Mystic River\" begins with the abduction and sexual assault of a young boy, and that sets the stage for the whole movie. No, this is not light, fluffy entertainment. This is a dark, heavy and tragic story about how a horrible event affects 3 (and, ultimately, more) lives. When Dave was abducted, he was playing street hockey with two friends, but it was Dave who was taken. After the portrayal of the assault, the movie picks up years later, when the lives of all three begin to come together again when the daughter of one of the three is murdered. Dave was played by Tim Robbins, who I thought was very convincing as a man tormented by his past. Jimmy, the father of the murdered girl, was also well played by Sean Penn. The character came across as something of a gangster-type, who decides to seek his own revenge against his daughter's killer. The most disappointing performance (perhaps because he was playing the least interesting character) was from Kevin Bacon as Sean, who has become a police detective and is hunting down the murderer.The story unfolds slowly but remains interesting throughout. The suggestion throughout was that Dave was the murderer, but right from the beginning that seemed too easy and obvious to me. That suspicion led to ultimately tragic results at the end of the movie that were at least the equal of the tragic beginning of the movie. Good use was made of locations, which added a realistic feel to the movie throughout. The strange relationship between Sean and his ex-wife, who would repeatedly phone him and then not speak, struck me as a little bit silly and I thought detracted from the story. In the end, I also wasn't sure how I should feel about what was happening. On the one hand, you have to feel sympathy for Jimmy, who has to come to terms with his daughter's murder. On the other hand, you have the sense that this guy needs to face some consequences for what he's done, and there's no indication that he will. So I was left with mixed emotions.Certainly, a good movie - but, as I said, a very heavy movie. 7/10",

Celeste suspects her husband Dave because of his suspicious behavior and Sean is assigned to the case as detective. Slowly and surprisingly the truth emerges.At first sight, Mystic River appears to be a thriller in the tradition of Seven, however it is essentially a completely different movie. As opposed to other thrillers, the emphasis was not put on solving the mystery, but on the influence the crimes have on the people involved. The effect on their family members and their environment. This is being perfectly illustrated by Mr. Eastwood. You can actually feel Jimmy's harrowing pain when he discovers his daughter has been murdered. This goes on the entire movie, feel, feel, feel. Obviously the acting performance of the protagonists is the crucial ingredient. It was hard to remember they were actors and not those sad people from Boston.Every separate frame looks like a beautiful picture with a beautiful composition and eye for detail, which make the events seem very \"real\". Even the accents of the protagonists are flawless. From start to finish, you feel as if you're in the quiet neighborhood of Boston.All in all, an incredibly well made movie with a surprising story. Yet it hardly matters if the story is surprising, you're bound to be fascinated by the sweet and the bitter in the world of Jimmy, Dave and Sean. Hats off to you sir Clint!",

Dave is ordered into their car so they can drive him home. After four days of sexual abuse, he escapes his captors, but his life is set on a wayward course forever.Twenty-five years later, the three are no longer friends. Sean (Kevin Bacon) is a homicide detective experiencing personal problems with his pregnant wife who has walked out on him. Jimmy (Sean Penn) has spent some time in prison for robberies and is trying to live a normal life running a grocery store.

He has trouble keeping jobs and struggles with a \"dark side\" emerging from his abduction.The performances are all good. Sean Penn filling out the production with a murky big-dangerous-hearted performance. Kevin Bacon anchoring with stability and level-headedness. Robbins performance is also good. However, the film experiences one coincidence after the other, manipulating its audiences rather heavy-handedly toward a rather predictable climax, and vague resolution. For just one example, isn't it rather surprising that for such a high profile case, the detective in charge just happens to be Jimmy's old friend?",

I may have missed this good film, and stayed in my mind with the stereotype of a bad director, if somehow I did not start seeing the DVD before realizing it was directed by him. I was wrong! Despite his bang-bang youth Eastwood is a solid director. 'Mystic River' is a well filmed drama, he knows to create a full world of emotions, classic in its approach of human relations and honor codes. He lets the superb cast to do its acting, and what an act it is! Sean Penn uses this role to climb one more step to the peaks of American film acting, to these altitudes where Nicholson and De Niro are waiting for him. Tim Robbins abandons for a while politics, and proves he can be a great actor and take upon complex roles without the need of a manifesto film. Kevin Bacon completes the trio in a solid and convincing manner. If there is a problem with this film, it lies in my opinion in its ending. The plot is complex, and the characters run convincingly each towards his or her fate, tragic for most. However, the last two or three scenes seem to have been added as some moral forgiveness comment of the directors. Trying to wipe out all the murder, abduction, child molesting and other traumatic events that have happened before in these final scenes is not convincing. It's actually the first time when what we see on the screen does not fully make sense. Otherwise - one of the best crime and friendship dramas lately. 8 out of 10 on my personal scale.",

            "content": "A devastating tale of three friends separated by a tragedy & reunited by another, Mystic River finds Clint Eastwood tackling the themes of friendship, loss, pain & revenge in this slow-burn mystery but the film's real highlight is the outstanding inputs from its ensemble.The story of Mystic River follows three men who were childhood friends once but have grown distant over the years. Their paths cross each other once again when one of them has a family tragedy, the investigation of which leads to conclusions that shatter each of their lives.Directed by Clint Eastwood, the film is another solid effort from the actor-turned-director as he puts more emphasis on the characters at hand than other elements, which in turn gives the actors more room to make their mark. Its period setting & controlled camerawork add to the mood & mystery but the film still wavers in the middle.Performances are its strongest suit, for Sean Penn, Tim Robbins & Kevin Bacon are absolutely brilliant in their given roles and their chemistry with each other carries that required sense of a history. Penn delivers the finest performance of the three and is expertly supported by Robbins whose troubling portrait of a man still being haunted by his disturbing past leaves a solid impression of its own.On an overall scale, Mystic River is undoubtedly amongst Clint Eastwood's better directorial efforts and is by all means a skilfully crafted & finely narrated example of its genre but it could've made an even better impression with a tighter editing. Also, what Penn & Robbins manage to accomplish with their respective characters here pretty much overshadows everything else. And for that alone, Mystic River is worth a shot.",

            "content": "More than anything, the performances of all involved is what makes this movie extremely riveting. Added to that, Eastwood's meticulous and methodical directing, which was obviously the driving force behind the great performances. Sean Penn and Kevin Bacon give enough intensity to their portrayal. As does Tim Robbins who carries out a deranged persona of someone who came out from a terrible childhood ordeal with scathing after effects.Marcia Gay Harden is also surprising and brings a lot of fear and doubt from her character. Linney brings maturity to her role, and during the turning point that launches Act 2, she and Penn conjure up the appropriate magnitude of emotion required. Let's not forget Laurence Fishburne who brings us his zeal and typical imposing persona that all of us know him for having... And hey, you've got to love Emmy Rossum, at least during her few minutes of screen time. She's just charming, but Phantom of the Opera is the movie to see if you want more from the girl who plays the ill-fated heroine in Mystic River.Interestingly you will see a lot of depth to the character's past and the interpersonal connections that each have. Much more than being a whodunnit, there are other twists in the end, - you wouldn't know Jimmy Markum's secret until all the pieces of the puzzle fall into place. And before meeting his fate, Dave Boyle (Robbins) redeems himself and the flashbacks reveal the act of violence that he did, that once divulged to us, the movie audience - can only be enough denouement we could ask for, well to make up for his disgraceful and forced confession to his tormentor and captor in the last scene.What the observing spectator may note from the way Eastwood operates as a director, and perhaps his writers as well is the amount of time and minutae executed with respect to bringing out the best and the worst from his characters and their ruined lives. Elements of disgrace. Elements of redemption. You will see some of those things as well as the movie closes. I hope I didn't give much away in my essay here, I'll just leave you to judge for yourself whether Mystic River deserves the critical acclaim it has from many, or from the other end of the polarized group of audiences; the hate and destructive contempt coming from the people who don't appreciate this film. It is up to you. As for myself, I found myself watching the whole movie through, there are times that on DVD I pause a film and watch it in 2 sittings, but for this one? I sat all the way through merely because the performances, the good story and direction made the 2 hours and 11 minutes blast by very fast.

            "content": "There are childhood friends who are inseparable and whose friendship lasts a lifetime, but I think they are exceptions. The truth, unfortunately, is that it seems difficult to maintain these friendships for so many years. As we change, as life changes us, we create and build facets of our personality that may, or may not, match well with our friends. Thus, the friends end up moving away because they don't understand each other like they used to. In addition, each one's own life course moves people away and closer, and the friends that childhood brought us will probably follow their lives away from us. I myself, thinking about my childhood, remember nostalgically the faces of those friends that I never saw again, and who followed their lives along paths that separated us. I can only hope, and wish, that they are well, wherever life has taken them.The story follows the lives of three Boston kids named Dave, Jimmy and Sean. Their lives are marked by a day when Dave is kidnapped and subjected to horrific sexual abuses. Years later, Jimmy's eldest daughter turns up dead, after a few hours missing. The investigation, led by Sean, who became a policeman, will focus precisely on Dave, who maintains a suspicious attitude and seems to have something to hide. But Sean must hurry to find out the truth, as Jimmy is determined to take matters into his own hands.This film talks about how life separates friendships, about how small moments can be decisive. Simple things, like getting into a car we never should have, or waiting a day before taking action. Clint Eastwood's meticulous direction combines perfectly with Helgeland and Lehane's impeccable script for a film that is truly memorable. It is a film with difficult themes, which make us think. The theme of friendship, of the way life shapes and changes us, is for me the center of the film, although it passes discreetly under another theme, which is that of sexual abuse perpetrated by pedophiles. It's a film made during the pedophilia scandal that shook Boston and its Catholic community, so it was a very current topic at the time (still is, let's face it).The film has a luxury cast, which is fully committed to work. Sean Penn does an impeccable job, perhaps one of his best works, having rightly deserved the Oscar for Best Actor, which he got with this performance. Equally impressive, Tim Robbins could hardly have done better, also earning the highest award in the film industry. Kevin Bacon presents himself in a much more restrained and discreet register, but equally powerful and effective. Also noteworthy is the impeccable work of Marcia Gay Harden and Laura Linney, and the excellent help of Lawrence Fishburne.Personally, I think Eastwood's films aren't the most remarkable in the most technical aspects. He is a director who knows how to privilege the story told, the work of the actors, the building of atmosphere, suspense and tension. However, being meticulous as he is, we must be aware of the effective way he uses cinematography and camera work to create tension: that scene where Dave is taken away and sees his friends left behind is simply anthology-worthy, and we don't need more words to understand what will follow in the life of that innocent character. Also the editing and mixing was done impeccably. Finally, a word for the soundtrack, which does not stand out or stay in the ear, but is perfect in the effort to create and work on suspense and dramatic tension.",

            "content": "\"Mystic River\" is one of those magical cinematic moments--such as \"The Godfather\" or \"Casablanca\"--where story, screenplay, director and actors combine to make a film that is truly perfect.  Clint Eastwood's direction has never been better, and Oscar nominees Sean Penn, Tim Robbins and Marcia Gay Harden all turn in the finest performances of their respective careers.The story begins in 1976, when three 12-year-old boys--Jimmy, Sean and Dave--are writing their names in wet concrete when a middle-aged man flashing an official-looking badge steps out of an official-looking Ford LTD and tells the kids to stop.  The man learns that Jimmy & Sean live on the block, but Dave doesn't, so he tells Dave to get into the car and he will drive Dave home.  Only the man doesn't drive Dave home because the man is not really a cop.  He is a pedophile who--along with his partner--keeps Dave locked in a basement for four days while they have their way with him.  On the fourth day, Dave escapes.The story flashes forward to 2001.  The boys are now 37.Jimmy (Penn) is now an ex-con (the extent of his criminality is not revealed until the end of the film) who runs a convenience store.  He has three daughters: two by his current wife Anabeth (Laura Linney), and 19-year-old Katie (Emmy Rossum) by his dead first wife.  Jimmy makes no secret that Katie is the favorite daughter.Sean (Kevin Bacon) is a homicide detective with the Massachusetts State Police whose wife (who does not appear until the end of the film) has left him and moved to New York, where she has given birth to Sean's baby, who he has never seen.Dave (Robbins) has grown into a deeply damaged adult who walks around the neighborhood, staring into space and talking to himself.  He is married to Jimmy's cousin Celeste (Harden), and they have an 8-year-old son Michael (Cayden Boyd).The trouble begins when Dave comes home and Celeste finds him covered in blood & refusing to go to the hospital.  The next day she learns that Katie has been murdered.  Sean and his partner Whitey Powers (Laurence Fishburne) are called to investigate.  And Jimmy--not content to let the police handle the case--asks his ex-partners in crime, the symbolically named Savage brothers (Kevin Chapman and Adam Nelson), to find Katie's murderer so Jimmy can kill him.What I really like is that--unlike the usual murder mystery--the focus is not on the investigation.  The few scenes concerning the police work are pretty much cribbed from \"Law & Order\".  Eastwood is more concerned about how such a thing affects the victim's loved ones.  In particular, the focus is on Jimmy--and to a lesser extent, his relationship with Dave.A few words must be said here about Sean Penn's performance.  About once a decade a truly magnificent performance is filmed that changes the art of acting forever.  In the '40's it was Humphrey Bogart in \"Casablanca\".  In the '50's it was Marlon Brando in \"A Streetcar Named Desire\".  In the '60's it was Dustin Hoffman in \"The Graduate\".  In the '70's it was Robert De Niro in \"Taxi Driver\".  In the '90's it was Anthony Hopkins in \"The Silence of the Lambs\".  And for this decade it is Sean Penn in \"Mystic River\".  Jimmy is at turns overwrought, depressed, surly, outraged, and finally just plain scary.  But Penn--even at his least subtle--never hits a wrong note.  His performance is the best thing about a nearly perfect movie.There might be a few quibbles here and there.  As I said, the scenes of police work seem merely routine; and Penn and Robbins both look a good deal older than 37.  But those pale in comparison to the film's strengths.  I liked the device of Dave being victimized each time he rides in the back of a car.  And the dialog written for Dave and the other character's dialog about Dave is almost poetic.  And Eastwood's sure hand as a director--particularly his expressionistic use of people in shadow rather than full light--show that, contrary to reviews of his work of the last 5 or 6 years, his talent has not dried up by a long shot.\"Mystic River\" is up for multiple Oscars this year and it deserves nearly all of them.  A truly great movie anchored by the greatest performance ever given by Sean Penn--already the greatest male actor of his generation. 10/10",

            "content": "Warning \u0096 Plenty of Spoilers (but not revealing the ending)Interestingly, all of the three lead actors in this movie portray a role that is the opposite to a previous role for which they are well know. Tim Robbins, the coolest of the cool in Shawshank redemption, plays an emotionally disturbed victim of childhood molesting. Sean Penn, a retarded nice guy in I Am Sam, in now a ruthless ex-crook. Kevin Bacon, who had played quite a few villain roles, including most recently The Hollow Man, is now a model law enforcer, for a change.Although the story does not quite have the twists and turns of Memento, it has a rather involved plot which is revealed through a gradual process. The following brief synopsis traces what happens chronologically, rather than how things are unveiled in the movie.25 years ago, three neighbourhood kids Jimmy (Penn), Sean (Bacon) and David (Robbins) ran into a couple of child molesters. Only David, the most timid, got abducted and was held for 4 days, which changed his whole life. While continuing to grow up in the same neighbourhood, they three lost touch with one another. David, despite the terrible experience, managed to get married to a woman called Celeste and had a kid. While living a mundane, outwardly normal life, he carries the shadow deep inside him. Sean, the most normal of the three, becomes a useful asset to society: a police detective. His private life however has not gone too well as his pregnant wife broke up with him, probably escalated from a petty fight for which both stubbornly refused to admit fault. Jimmy, the most rebellious, betrayed by a crook named Harris, got two years in prison. Coming out, he killed Harris, but sent money monthly from another city to his wife, who believed that her husband had left her but was responsible enough to continue supporting the family of two sons, Brendan and younger brother Ray, a mute. When his wife died of illness, Jimmy re-married, to Celeste's sister Annabeth, who bore him two more girls, in addition to lovely Katie from his first wife. \nThe story evolved around the murder of Katie who, shot in her car, tried to escape into the woods, and was beaten on the head and shot again. Brendan Harris, Katie's boyfriend who is going to run away with her to Vegas, becomes the first suspect, particularly after the killing bullets are found to have been fired from a gun his father used years ago in a burglary. The fact that Katie's father openly hates the Harris family does not help him either. However, David soon becomes a prime suspect. On the murder night, he actually saw Katie at a bar, and came home later covered in blood, with his hand slashed. Celeste does not find her husband's story about a mugger convincing and the couple falls under the shadow of mistrust and hidden tension. While I'm not going to reveal the crucial ending here, I would say that it's unsatisfactory. Most unconvincing is that Sean, a model law enforcing officer, will back off from pursuing a crime which he knows has taken place, and this is not even a case of dubiously justifiable vigilante-type revenge. Eastwood's direction offers lucid use of the movie camera, in a good variety of shots, particularly during the early part of the movie. I particularly like the scene with Robbins and Penn sitting in the back porch, when the subdued intensity of their dialogue is captured by a succession of alternating, approaching close ups. The power of this series of static shots cannot be matched by even the most violent of physical movements. Overall, Eastwood has stayed clear of the sensational thriller, or the Hitchcock look-alike suspense approaches. The exceptionally plain story telling is very effective with this movie, leaving the audience to focus on enjoying the acting.As my summary line suggests, there is plenty of good acting, and this is not just the three key roles, but all around. Penn has the most explosive role, which he handles well. But somehow, there is a feeling that he is trying maybe just a touch too hard, with at the back of his mind that Oscar that I Am Sam didn't fetch him. Robbins on the other hand has just the right touch, subtle where he should be and explicit where he needs to be. Bacon's role is more standard, in which it's easy to do a respectable job but hard to shine. The interesting little interlude of the silent phone call from his estranged wife does help to brighten things up. He is also helped by interaction with dependable Laurence Fishburne, once charismatic and explosive Morpheus in Matrix, now all rational and restrained. Not to be outshone are the two women, sisters in the movie, married to David and Jimmy. Oscar holder Marcia Gay Harden plays near neurotic Celeste so well that the audience is torn between pitying her and despising her. Laura Linney, with a fraction of the screen time allotted to Harden, delivered top-notch performance in a scene where Annabeth, after the rather traumatic climax experienced by husband Jimmy, reassures him that he is always king in a family that will forever be strong. The younger members of the cast Tom Guiry (Brendan), Emmy Rossum (Katie) and Spencer Treat Clark (Ray) all put in good performances that complement those of the veterans. All told, the two-and-a-quarter hour movie is a very enjoyable cinematic experiences mainly because of well-balanced, all round good acting.",

            "review_title": "Mystic Tragedy",
            "content": "Mystic River is a very mysterious and tragic film. The mood of the movie is very dark, suspenseful, and chilling. The movie starts out with three boys playing stickball in a rough section of Boston, known as East Buckingham. Jimmy Markum (Sean Penn), Dave Boyle (Tim Robbins), and Sean Devine (Kevin Bacon) always did what most boys do in their neighborhood. Nothing exciting ever happened until one day Dave was forced to take the ride that would change all their lives forever. The boys all stopped spending time together and eventually grew apart. Their lives all turned in different directions. Now twenty-five years later, yet another life-altering event, the murder of Jimmy's daughter, brings them all back together again. Sean has become a cop, and he and his partner are now assigned to unravel this mysterious crime. Jimmy, now full of rage, wants to find his daughters murderer. Sean must stay a couple steps ahead of him so no one gets killed. Dave comes home late one night with blood all over him. The same night Jimmy's daughter, Katie, was murdered. Dave's wife, Celeste, helps him clean everything up. The next day Dave starts to act weird and becomes distant. Celeste now thinks that something's up and he may be the killer of Katie. Because of Dave's terrifying past, he is now a suspect in the mysterious crime. I loved the film. Clint Eastwood did an amazing job directing it. The scenes, setting and story plot are fantastic. The music keeps you on your toes and was perfect for this movie. Mystic River is full of suspense and mystery. For me the film was a little to long. There is not to much I would change about it though. This was my favorite movie out of all the films we have seen so far. I really did not like how the movie ended. I believe all the actors did a phenomenal job playing their roles. Sean Penn did an excellent job playing the enraged father, Jimmy. Tim Robbins did fantastic as the disturbed Dave. Kevin Bacon did amazing playing the role as the determined cop Sean. Marcia Gay Harden played the role as Celeste. Celeste is Dave's wife in the movie, and did a fantastic job acting scared, nervous, and suspicious of Dave's late night out. Laura Linney as the role of Annabeth. In the film, Annabeth is Jimmy's wife, and does an amazing job acting strong, tough, and very protective. Then playing the role as Sean's partner Whitey is Laurence Fishburne. In the movie she is a homicide detective and stands by Sean's side trying to unravel the murder.Anyone who enjoys suspenseful, mysterious movies should watch this one. Clint Eastwood did an amazing job not only getting the right actors for this film, but an awesome job directing it. You could not ask for a better movie. It has its twists and turn to keep you guessing on who murdered Katie. This is one of my favorite movies. I can't believe how the movie ended. I rate this movie a 10 out of 10!! Word Count: 522",

I respect all the people involved--Eastwood is a fine artist, as are Linney, Robbins, etc--but Eastwood's film, except for a few performances and technical aspects, never even rises to the level of mediocrity. Eastwood trusts the performers too much to correct the bad acting which repeatedly crops up. The dialogue, by the otherwise admirable Helgeland, is often woefully unrealistic and ham-handed. Above all, the story is a complete disappointment; the audience is left mystified, rather than wowed, at the film's epilogue. Clearly this film was not made for me.",

            "content": "I could tell you Clint Eastwood adds sure-handed direction for this film, and while that is true, it doesn't actually tell you anything. What I can tell you is to watch the eyes. This is a story told by the eyes, and the subject matter couldn't have been approached any better.The plot is fantastically construed, but I believe a slight disclaimer is in order. This is a dark film. Don't come in with expectations to be cheered up after a rough Saturday night when Jimmy left you for hot Chris or whatever-- this isn't that film. And hey, a lot of the best films are very dark in nature. If you end up watching Mystic River and think to yourself, \"Wow, that is such an awesome film!\" then I also highly recommend the more recent Prisoners. That movie absolutely deserves a review, but not now.Anyways, we are introduced to the 3 principle characters-- Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, and Kevin Bacon-- when they were kids and loved street hockey. Two \"officers\" come up to them and take Dave (Robbins) in their car. It's never shown but rather highly implied of what they do to poor Dave. Flash forward to their adult lives, and all three of them have issues. Robbins is still uneasy from the childhood experience, Bacon is a detective whose wife left without a word and calls frequently (without any words either), and Penn is an ex-con. Within the first 30 minutes, Penn's 19-year-old daughter is murdered, Bacon is assigned to the case, and Robbins becomes a suspect. It's a compelling setup with all the ingredients mixed in for a great mystery, and it achieves that but with added emotional punch as well.Anybody who says their heartbeat was normal after viewing this film is flat out lying. Penn is dynamic and on edge, Robbins is a very disturbed character whose own wife questions his sanity, and Bacon rounds it out as the sympathetic old friend. In other hands the film could have even turned sappy with all the crossing paths, but this movie is the exact opposite. It is intense in its calmness. All this combines with a score Eastwood did himself with help from his son and an orchestra.Mystic River. It's a pretty ambiguous title that fits perfectly. There's closure to the film, but so much is left open for interpretation to the audience. And that's what Christopher Nolan films and Lost in Translation, among others, do so well that become my favorite types of movies. Throughout Mystic River is well-developed, well-thought out scene after scene that doesn't want you to see it again the next day or even the next week, but in a year or so, you will be dragged back to the film with the eagerness and anticipation to understand the puzzle fully even if it's missing one piece. Perhaps I have not said enough about the film, or did I give just enough context to make you watch it? Who knows, I'll leave it up to you.\nYou can find this review and dozens of others at gillipediamoviereviews.blogspot.com",

            "content": "I haven't seen this movie for years. I video'd it last night. Again I thoroughly enjoyed it. It's a movie I had to watch to the end. It's about blind rage, an unfortunate party, and the shocking truth. Penn, who again, overacts, sort of, explodes as to the shattering and confronting news of his young daughter who's been shot and beaten to death, in a state, many fathers would not like to find their daughters. With rage consuming him, ex con Penn, ready with his ex con hitters, are out to nail anyone suspect. The story, (kind of Sleepers-ish if you can remember that one) starts off in pull no punches style with Penn as a little boy punk, who after playing street hockey, with his two mates, leads them up to a bit of no good, etching their signatures, into some concrete, that's hardening. A car pulls into frame, a middle aged guy, masquerading as a cop with his older perverted grandpa I guess, forces one of them into a car, of course the more innocent and vulnerable of the boys, gets in, where he endures a four day ordeal of kidnapping and sexual child rape by these deviates. Although this opening, is really related to what follows, it's necessary, as you'll see. Cut to the present, Penn and his mates, all grown up, are reunited by the horrible fate of Penn's murdered daughter. The vulnerable Dave played by Tim Robbins, might know or could be involved with what's happened, so we have a good thriller angle too, which kept me watching to the end, among other things. The other of Penn's friends, now grown up is played by Kevin Bacon, working the murder with a much sharper partner, a beefed up Laurence Fishburne who milks his role. It's one of many solid performances, where there are greater ones too. Laura Linney is incredible as Penn's grieving wife, but no finer performance of course here, is from Robbins, who's never acted better. He's a slow, backward, Mr Average character, with the great accent I loved, who at some moments, almost sounded like Dustin Hoffman. He cops a lot of suspicion here, and takes a bad rap in many ways. What made my eyes tear a little, was the fantastic, indisputably sad and affecting music score. Penn, is good in how he can convey many emotions of loss here. In that respect, apart from the slight shades of overacting, he's great. Marcia Gay Harden as Robbin's supportive wife had me doubtful on whether it was her, as I really thought it was Lili Taylor, but Harden gives a tour de force performance, an actress we don't see on the screen much, but should see much more of. This film is just one in a string of great Eastwood films, that have set a higher level of quality, in the Millennium, to older ones of his, and no, Bloodwork, isn't included here. Up there with Changeling, or more recently, the brilliant American Sniper, this is Eastwood's best ever. Mystic Rived, mystic to it's title, is an excellent film, superbly acted, and beautifully shot, with pedophile themes, but none a greater justice either.",

            "review_title": "The most impressive thing was the cast.",
            "content": "Before I go on, I should mention that Mystic River is an outstandingly well-made movie. I saw it months after it was released, after it had been acclaimed one of the best movies of the year, and after it had officially been nominated for a Best Picture Oscar. So I guess I just expected more, especially from Clint Eastwood, one of the greatest living stars of the cinema. That being said, I can appreciate it being hailed as one of the best pictures of 2003, it definitely was, but I was bothered that Big Fish wasn't nominated for Best Picture BEFORE I saw this movie. And I'm sorry to all you Eastwood/Penn/Fishburne/ Linney/Robbins/Bacon/etc fans out there, but Big Fish was better. I was immensely impressed with the cast in this movie. For the first half hour or so, almost every scene introduced another well-known and enormously talented actor. Lawrence Fishburne proves that he has not been typecast as Morpheus (thank God), Sean Penn delivers yet another smashing performance as a man desperately trying to cope with his emotions, which have been scattered out of control, I was shocked at Tim Robbins' incredible ability to completely transform his voice to one with a Boston accent (this is one of the most difficult things for a well-known actor to do), Kevin Bacon makes an outstanding detective (he's one of the most versatile actors working today, regardless of how much you like or dislike him), and Laura Linney gives a performance that is interesting in that it is hugely effective but she still seems to be holding something back. Even while you're seeing her perform this role with amazing skill, you can tell that she is an even better actor than you're seeing. (spoilers) Essentially, Mystic River is a murder mystery. Robbins, Bacon, and Penn play the parts of Dave, Sean, and Jimmy, three kids who grew up in the same neighborhood (two on the same street) but grew apart as they got older (grew apart, that is, in contact, not so much in proximity). The film begins with them carving their names into wet cement when a black car comes along and a man gets out, pretending to be a police officer. Sean and Jimmy live on that very street, so they are let go, but Dave lives across the neighborhood, so he has to get into the car to be taken home. It's not long after that car stops that you know it's not really a police officer (even back then their cars were never that filthy), and so Dave is kidnapped and, while it's never explicitly mentioned in the movie what happened to him beyond that he was held in a dirty basement for four hours, the unnecessary hints are more than enough.What I like about the murder mystery that comes later is that Dave has such a concrete mental reason for committing the murder that he did. It's understandable that he might have gotten scared and not come out and admitted what he did, but I would have thought that he would at least have told his wife what really happened. She was obviously not going to turn him in, given the extent to which she went to cover up her beating of what he claimed to be a mugger. Meanwhile, the same night, Jimmy's 19-year-old daughter has been shot and beaten to death in another part of the city, and Sean is the detective assigned to the case, along with his curiously named partner, Whitey Powers (Lawrence Fishburne). Hopefully there's no subtle meaning to what happens when you remove the last letters of his first and last name.What Eastwood constructs from this outline is a tense thriller that comes to a tense conclusion that, I think, is just a little too similar to the tense conclusion of his outstanding 1999 film True Crime. Sean, Dave, and Jimmy have interestingly all grown into fairly unhappy or at least spotty lives, Jimmy as the owner of the corner store (closely watching over his 19-year-old daughter), Dave as a handyman with deep emotional scars from his childhood, and Sean as the homicide detective with the nutcase of a wife who keeps calling and then not saying anything. Jimmy's daughter is dating a boy named Brendan, who Jimmy viciously disapproved of, and he is asked at several points in the movie why he dislikes the boy so much, and he can't really answer, because he has no reason. He dislikes the boy so much because the screenplay needs him to.Each of the actors is given at least one scene where their acting abilities are tested, and mostly all of them do remarkably well. It's kind of disappointing to learn that Sean Penn is just as incapable of doing crying scenes as Jack Nicholson proved that he also is in Something's Gotta Give (indeed, Tom Guiry, who played Brendan, performed his crying scene much better than Penn did). I think Penn is more skilled as a man who is struggling with his emotions and the chaos in his life, illustrated through the lines on his forehead and the vacant look in his eyes. Actually crying is a little too forward for him. So now that I've made my superficial complaint, I think that the main reason that I don't think Mystic River deserves the massive Oscar buzz that it has generated, besides the fact that Big Fish is better by leaps and bounds, is because underneath all the big names and impressive production value, it is really a pretty simple detective story. Sean and Whitey (Bacon and Fishburne), as the lead investigators working on the case of Jimmy's missing daughter, spend the majority of their scenes together acting like bumbling B-movie detectives, speaking to each other as though they have to explain everything they say to the other person. They're both detectives, right? So why do they constantly have to explain to each other why certain theories and possibilities won't work? The vast majority of their conversations with each other in respect to the case are so obviously contrived that it's almost like they're reading cue cards, and I happen to know that they are each better actors than to do something like that. That's just shoddy writing. Sean's wife also plays a rather obscure and unnecessary role. Sure, she represents the chaos that has befallen Sean's life, as well as the order that ultimately follows (conveniently when the case is solved), but the symbolism is so shallow and textbook that the movie would have been better off without it. If anything, they could have had her start actually talking to her some other time than the exact minute that Sean discovers the last remnants of the mystery still lurking beneath the surface of the screenplay. Jimmy admits what he did, Sean's face registers the understandable shock, and his phone rings. Cute. And while I'm at it, I might as well mention that, by the time the case is solved, Sean has been working on it too hard and for too long to simply let Jimmy walk away at the end, chugging his bottle of Jack Daniel's as he walks down the street, having admitted to killing Dave. It really bothered me that he was willing to just let him walk away like that (sure, he lost his daughter and was an old friend, but he also killed their other old friend. Was Sean just going to let that go?). The only reason that I can think of for doing this was a pretty effective shot that came later during a parade downtown. Dave's wife can be seen wandering the crowd aimlessly, Sean is there with his own family, and as he looks into the crowd across the street, he sees Jimmy surrounded by his usual hoodlums, the ones who had been conducting his own tragically misled investigation of his daughter's murder. As Sean looks at Jimmy, he makes a gun with his fingers and points it at Jimmy, I suppose indicating that he plans to take him down in the future (or maybe just saying hi, imagine the same gesture with a wink, for example), to which Jimmy responds by spreading his hands and raising his eyebrows as if to say, `What are you gonna do?' I love the way Jimmy looks in this shot. He's matured in the few moments since we last saw him. Years have been added to his life, he has noticeably changed. His new confidence and his new experience and the way he sits, is dressed, and carries himself indicate that he has become a different person.\nHe's become a godfather.",

            "content": "Mystic River the film, like the Dennis Lehane novel Brian Helgeland adapted for it, seeks to raise the police procedural/murder mystery genre to the level of dark, solemn, tragic epic, much as do the Godfather series and James Gray's The Yards. The story aims successfully to convey the essential feel of life in working class Boston \u0096 especially the lifelong interconnectedness of its inhabitants. A doomed common past congeals into the film's prologue with three eleven-year-old boys playing hockey in the street in front of their houses. Jimmy and Dean watch while Dave is lured away in a car by two evil men posing as cops. We understand with horror that he is sexually abused and tortured for four days before he manages to run away. `Sometimes it seems as if we all three got in that car,' the adult Jimmy says. `Escaped from wolves' is how Dave sees himself. Dave's terrible childhood experience highlights the brutal, inhuman side of mankind. The horror of it hovers over the events that follow. Twenty-five years later Jimmy's 19-year old daughter is found murdered in a deep hole in a wood much like the cellar where Dave was held by the molesters. The murder reactivates the painful ties between these three individuals, their families, and their emotional histories.\nThe movie unfolds in the slow, solemn, methodical, sometimes flat Clint Eastwood directorial style that for the most part works compellingly here because of the story's inherently tragic overtones and because the excellent cast acts with powerful understatement. A forgivable exception is Sean Penn in the lead role as Jimmy Markum, the murdered girl's dad, a reformed criminal who owns a convenience store. He is a violent man who races to find the murderer before the homicide detectives, one of whom is the other boy who watched Dave taken away, Sean Devine (Kevin Bacon). Penn's performance is explosive, the others' implosive. The Jimmy/Sean dualism is obvious. The wild card is Dave (hauntingly played by Tim Robbins), a recessive, suffering handyman whose wife suspects him because he has come home very late on the night of the murder saying he's killed a mugger. Not only is the painful intimacy between the three men reactivated by the murder, but Dave's and Jimmy's wives are cousins. It's as if the people are all cousins. They cannot escape from each other. This is a closed world of haunted memories and moldering disappointments. Katie, the dead girl, had a boyfriend, Brendan Harris (Tom Guiry) who was about to run away with her. Brendan has a mean, foulmouthed mother and a mute younger brother and the boys and the brother's best pal were often seen at Jimmy's convenience store, just as Dave was at the bar where Katie was seen the night she died. A nightmare has begun and we watch with fascination as it unfolds. As the detective Dean, with his partner Whitey (Laurence Fishburne), explore the case, the many characters are serially highlighted. A punishing and manipulative final sequence cuts back and forth between a vigilante killing and the detectives' tracking down of the real killer. There are some oddities. At forty-three (Penn) and forty-five (Bacon and Robbins), the lead actors are clearly too old for the thirty-five-year old characters they're playing. (That they're meant to be that young means Jimmy was 16 when his daughter Katie was born.) Halfway through Whitey and Dean are revealed to be working for the FBI; why wasn't this clear earlier? Bacon's relatively uninteresting performance can't entirely be faulted, since his role is purely functional, but it's still a disappointment. The shots of his missing wife showing only part of her face at a pay phone seem pointless teases. Marcia Gay Harden's skittishness is mannered and irritating. And there are times when the relentless rhythm of the movie begins to falter and merely seem slow. Dave is sucked down by a crime of which he was the victim and it seems he too must be punished after he has sought indirect revenge for the perverted act that has maimed him for life. Yet his own incestuous murder goes unpunished. The fatalism of the story must have appealed to Eastwood's sensibility, but also its rootedness in the mundane world of working class Boston. The interconnectedness and slow inevitablability of Mystic River's sad story may link it with the Greeks, but it's only the everyday naturalism the film achieves that validates the film as tragedy, that gives the violent events true weight and humanity. The film's solemnity works because of the way Robbins and Bacon (Penn less so) immaculately mimic Boston accents and the cameramen capture the familiar look of Boston Streets and interiors. Without that anchoring in the ordinary, the high air of epic horror would seem garish and cheap. Clint Eastwood ages well. At seventy-three he has directed perhaps his most complex film. And he has even composed the sad, brooding, but never heavy-handed score, which with a poetic justice rare in Hollywood is performed by the Boston Symphony Orchestra.",

            "content": "Give Clint Eastwood a great script for a drama, and he's going to make a great movie. He may not always be able to modify his filmmaking style appropriately to different genres, but he is very good at the slow burn drama. Written by Brian Helgeland (a screenwriter of, shall we say, inconsistent results) based on the novel by Dennis LeHane, Mystic River ends up feeling like yet another reaction to Dirty Harry from Eastwood. Here's a tale of vigilante justice born of a very realistic portrait of pain, trauma, and lingering memories that can never be pushed away.Jimmy Markum (Sean Penn) is a former thief gone straight after the death of his wife while he was in prison, leaving him alone with his daughter Katie (Emmy Rossum) once he got out. He remarried to Annabeth (Laura Linney) and had two more daughters, but Katie is obviously his favorite, the one he has the closest connection to. He's also one of three friends from the Southie neighborhood of Boston who either witnessed or experienced a terrible crime in their youth. Jimmy and his friend Sean (Kevin Bacon) watched as Dave (Tim Robbins) was all but forced into a car by two men calling themselves police before he disappeared for four days when he was abused in a basement until his escape.One day, twenty-five years later, when all three friends have split off to live their own adult lives, Katie ends up dead in a park, an event that brings together the friends in different ways for the first time in years and recalls a host of past sins. Sean, now a police detective with the Staties with a wife who has left him and calls him without saying anything, seemingly waiting for something, gets the job as lead investigator with his partner Whitey (Laurence Fishburne). Dave is immediately at the center of audience suspicion for coming home that some night covered in blood, a situation that his wife Celeste (Marcia Gay Harden) helps him cover up without getting a straight answer about what happened to him.Now, this movie works really well as it is, but there's one pet peeve of mine that it slightly picks at: lying to the audience. We could know Dave's either innocence or guilt in the crime of the murder of Katie Markum that night. We're following Dave around that night and see him see her in a bar that night with her two friends, making a scene of themselves. And yet, people love their mysteries. My thing is that first of all, following Dave and then cutting off his side of things right before a key event is a cheat. Secondly, I think the point of the film is the tragedy, not the mystery. I don't think you'd lose much of anything narratively by revealing the truth early instead of keeping it hidden.The point of the film really is this exploration of the past in the present, of Dave taking his ten year old son past the point he was kidnapped on a walk home from a little league baseball game, of Dave expressing a desire for crime to come back to bring property values back down, of being so consumed by a terrible event that one cannot be honest about oneself to other people any more. I hadn't seen this film in at least fifteen years, so I couldn't remember the real identity of the killer as the investigation began into Katie's murder. I honestly didn't care, though. I didn't want to figure out the killer's identity in a mystery (I remembered about halfway through all of a sudden), but I loved the exploration of character.It's easy to fall backwards and call this an actor's showcase. It is filled with great performances, but they are really helped by the incredible writing. There are so many echoes throughout the film as events inform each other, especially around Katie's unknown boyfriend Brendan (Tom Guiry) and his own father's past with Jimmy. Why did Katie and Brendan have to sneak around and plan an elopement to Las Vegas to be together? Because Jimmy went to jail when Brendan's father turned him in on a robbery. He holds a grudge against the whole family, afraid of Brendan becoming unreliable and backstabbing like his own father, something Jimmy doesn't want his daughter attached to. It becomes ironic when Brendan effectively becomes a proto-Jimmy at a certain point late in the film.The center of all of this is, of course, Dave, and Tim Robbins is really amazing as the broken man carrying such awful baggage through his whole life no matter what he does. It creates a barrier between him and everyone else, including his own wife, and he has trouble interacting in such a highwire situation where he looks guilty but insists that he's not. Why not just tell the truth? Because he can't. He can't admit what happened because it's too close to his own awful experience, where the wolves attacked the boy as he tells his son in a bedtime story. I don't think Dave's tragedy is helped by a false lead regarding his guilt or innocence in the investigation. In fact, I think knowing the truth of what happened actually highlights the tragedy of his path. He gets trapped, and he doesn't know a way out.Now, so much of Eastwood's directing work feels a reaction to Dirty Harry, and this is no exception. Jimmy takes justice into his own hands, and he does it wrong. He is only concerned with the justice of finding his daughter's killer, and he's too ready to act without real evidence. Harry Callahan was never unsure of his target no matter the niceties of police procedure either, but he had the advantage of never being wrong (I really wanted to see him be wrong once, which would have made an interesting story to put him in). Here, that wrongness happens, and the implications of that incorrect action ends up dominating the final moments of the film. It's an interesting contrast as Annabeth justifies it to him like Lady Macbeth while those wounded by his decision have no idea what has happened, only that they've been hurt. It's a rationalization of doing wrong that the look of the wounded parties obviously undercuts. I read some random comment from some random nobody about how this film justifies vigilante justice, even when it gets it wrong, which is what Annabeth says, but the rest of the film operates against that idea completely. It's about how you read movies. Watching someone get away with a crime doesn't mean that the film is okay with it. You have to see what else is going on to see if that's actually the case, and a woman earnestly looking around for her innocent husband who is now missing doesn't tell me that the movie thinks that Jimmy was a good man.This is really a triumph of Eastwood's career. It takes a great script, pulls out great performances from his actors, and he keeps the action on a slow burn that really plays well into the film's narrative drive. This is his best film since Unforgiven (though he'd certainly made very good stuff), but it's also a marked contrast to the rather limp Blood Work. This feels like the start of Eastwood's late stages in his career, and he handles it exceptionally well.",

Until the day thugs masquerading as cops abducted Dave and kept him in a cellar for four days. This, of course, messed Dave up a little, and as an adult he's not quite all there.Fast-forward to the present. Jimmy's 19-year-old daughter Katie is brutally murdered, and suddenly the three friends, who have drifted a bit over the years, are brought back together. Sean, who's now a cop, is on the case.The movie was nominated for six Oscars and won two (Penn as Jimmy, Robbins as Dave). To me, it was spellbinding. When I'm watching a movie at home, there are plenty of little distractions - Oh, I need something to eat, Oh, I gotta go to the bathroom, Oh, the dog needs to go out, and so forth - and as a result if the movie isn't totally compelling I'll watch it in installments. But with Mystic River I didn't even notice the time until the movie was nearly an hour old. Eastwood's direction - and Brian Helgeland's screenplay - were so mesmerizing that I was completely drawn into the movie, believing every second, feeling like I was a bystander, rather than an audience. That is excellent filmmaking.Also in the incredible cast are Marcia Gay Harden (who earned a nomination herself), Laurence Fishburne, Laura Linney, and Tom Guiry. (Guiry has come into his own as an adult actor; I remember seeing him in 1993's The Sandlot as the new kid in town.)A must-see for fans of mystery/suspense movies.",

Three childhood friends come back into contact years later after a horrific event. One of the friend's children has been murdered and the hunt is on for the killer(s). Where the trail leads is startling and exhilarating. The plot starts off fairly simple and yet gets quickly complicated as all the characters come into play. And these characters are anything but simple. Even the bad guys (and there are many) are three dimensional Sean Penn's character being the most glaring example. Of course what people will talk about for years is the ending. What a bombshell.

At the end, she tells Jimmy (kind of) that he should basically continue the life of crime he lived before. It also hints that she could have stopped him killing Dave (\"why didn't you call\") but she didn't, because she liked Jimmy that way. Also, all the wat at the end, at the parade...she looks at Dave's wife almost with a cold stare...almost not caring what his wife is feeling.There were a lot of confusing parts in this movie. One that deals with this is the fact that Kevin Bacon, at the end, also kind of shows no remorse towards Daves wife when he looks at her. Its just like \"oh well, I am back with my wife...go away.\" And talking about that, I see NO POINT in having Kevin Bacon having a wife in the film...maybe I missed something.I had no idea about the story and towards the beginning believed she might have been the killer.",

But this is not merely the result of the man's mastery of his craft, it is the result of Eastwood's ability to uncover the emotional connection, in the viewer, between what he sees on the screen and what he sees, though usually ignores, in real life. Horrific events occur in everyone's life - and though the events may not be newsworthy (such as the death of a loved one from a lingering disease), the impact is historic for our inner emotional lives. Eastwood has managed,in MYSTIC RIVER, to create a world so personal, so much like our own, everyday lives, that virtually anyone will be able to read themselves into the characters - if not, the actual circumstances of the crimes depicted. When the viewer leaves the theatre, therefore, he leaves it to see his own, everyday life, in a new, sometimes unbearable, light. It's not \"just a movie\" as much as you may want it to be.",

We then have a drawn out section of the film where nothing happens for about half an hour other than Sean Penn brooding. The cast are good - Sean Penn looks and acts like Robert de Niro, Kevin Bacon is his usual likable self while Tim Robbins gives the most interesting performance as Dave.The film doesn't need to show the violence so graphically at the end where there is also a piece of philosophical nonsense between Penn and Bacon about what would have happened if either of them had got into the car with the stranger at the beginning of the film when they were boys. It's obvious that no-one connected with the film had actually been kidnapped as a youngster. They are talking crap. Clint Eastwood directs so there is a predictable \"vigilante wins\" theme to the story. But why should Penn's vigilante antics be any more acceptable than Dave's? There is also an unnecessary storyline concerning Bacon and his wife which adds nothing to the film.

            "content": "\"We bury our sins here, Dave. We wash them clean.\"Mystic River and Unforgiven are my two favorite Clint Eastwood films and depending on which one I see last I tend to put in first place. Right now I'm inclined to declare Mystic River as Eastwood's best film, but that is subject to change anytime (perhaps even before I finish writing this review). Nominated for six Academy Awards, the film won two: Sean Penn for Best Actor in a Leading Role and Tim Robbins for Best Supporting Actor. I was rooting for Brian Helgeland's wonderful screenplay adaptation from Dennis Lehane's novel, but it lost out to The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. Helgeland had previously won an Oscar for his adaptation of L.A. Confidential, which is another wonderful thriller. Lehane's novel adaptations have always translated well to the big screen and I recommend each one: The Drop, Shutter Island, and Gone Baby Gone. So when putting these two great writers together you are guaranteed an intriguing story with rich characters, which is one of the reasons why I love Mystic River. On a side note I just want to say that Lehane's novel, Live By Night, is being directed by Ben Affleck and will be released some time next year. It's already my frontrunner for Best Picture at the 2017 Academy Awards without knowing anything else about it. Mystic River's underlying theme is the loss of innocence. The story centers around three childhood friends whose life is forever changed when one of them is abducted and molested for several days before he manages to escape. The film centers on these three characters now that they are adults. Dave (Tim Robbins), the victim, is now a married man, but he is clearly traumatized by the abuse he received. Sean (Kevin Bacon) has become a homicide detective, while Jimmy (Sean Penn) is an ex- con who is now a loving father of three. When Jimmy's daughter goes missing and is found dead, Sean takes over the investigation, but Jimmy is not going to let whoever committed this terrible crime go unpunished. Mystic River stands out for its clever screenplay, and that usually translates to fantastic performances. Sean Penn delivers one of his best performances and the scene where he finds out his daughter has been murdered is heart-breaking. Tim Robbins is also fantastic playing a traumatized man whose life was changed by that terrible event during his childhood. Sean Penn is perhaps given the most straightforward scenes as the detective, but even he shares some powerful scenes with Sean Penn. Laura Linney and Marcia Gay Harden also have some intense dramatic scenes. The film stands out thanks to its powerful performances and the surprising dark reveals along the way. It could even stand out on its own for the detective story, but it is carried to another level thanks to the impressive performances and Eastwood's solid direction.\"The last time I saw Dave\u0085That was twenty-five years ago, going up this street, in the back of that car.\" That quote left me with goosebumps all over my arms and a quick chill run through my spine.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",

The writing in the drying cement, Robbins name half carved - later to be revisited - the familial betrayal by the unredeemed killer sons.Mystic river - the secrets it holds will captivate. As deep as the faithfulness of the Shakespearan wife in strict devotion - and the extreme of the biblical wife - fallen, untrustfull, afraid to the point of absurdity of her broken husband (Robbins).The film is replete with memorable scenes that won't soon leave one's cinematic mind - the boy abducted in the black \"hearse\" - the three daughters dancing on the bar, inebriated, naive of the force of men destructed. The blood on Robbins shirt as he returns to his betrayer.The sinister seduction, of both unmanifested dreams - the unfulfilled dream for the two young lovers to leave Boston, and the deep eddying river that repeats the sins of fathers, relieves the horror of sons discovering the sin of the father - the seduction of Penn's wife, to power, to an unfathomable rage and a sense of just revenge.The parade ends it. The handshake click of a make-believe gun - the sinner and the broken cop, unwilling to accede to his role in letting Robbins' life become soulless and a brief step away from the swallowing, forgetful Mystic.This movie is deeply flawed, however. And it's tragic that Eastwood didn't remove the flaw of the boys' confession - so unnecessary and unmotivated. The only \"clue\" - the Deus Ex Machina that resolves the mystery. An inference can only be made that this flaw was necessary - that it was an homage to Shakespeare, Sartre, or even Eugene O'Neil... But this is a stretch - an irremediable flaw, simply.But the movie doesn't suffer from it - rather it succeeds on creating tragedy and importing fate into American film, a trait which has been so lacking, given the ethos of self-creation, and free will. Here, instead, the gods intervene, to give up the killer, to punish a man, Robbins, that was more worthy of heaven, and perhaps this was the happy end, to have his sin absolved by the Mystic.One of the strongest films of the decade.

            "content": "Mystic River has one of the most solemn and contentious stories I have seen this year. It leaves you with a bitter pill that showcases the inefficiencies and corruption of the justice system at bringing \"justice\" to those negatively affected. It makes us care about the characters even if they end up participating in loathsome and immoral activities. We start the movie by caring for Jimmy and his portrayal of a loving family man that is aggressively overprotective, sympathetic of Dave's agony for being abducted and sexually abused as a child, and compassionate for Sean's marital situation and apparent devotion to his job. The movie makes us care, but then elucidates complex characters with inconsistent moral convictions and violent behaviors. It accomplishes excellently the goal of delivering multi-dimensional characters.The little allegory of the names drawn on the pavement is an interesting demonstration of how people can be broken since their early stages in life and remain broken until society finishes them off. Dave's reason to murder  was his rage against child molestation and injustice. Unfortunately this marked his life from beginning to end. Sean (justice system) was not fast enough to be able to solve the situation and evil (jimmy) remained unpunished. Only at the end of the movie, when Sean informs Jimmy that he found the culprits, is the justice system able to give Dave some justice, but he is already dead. It is remarkable how we get to care about Jimmy so much and then see him descend into immorality by a tragedy.There are several scenes that captured my attention. When you see a sign of a cross in a movie and a scene where a child seems to be in danger, you can almost predict what's going to happen. We also see him receiving the bad news as his daughter is receiving her first communion. In my opinion, the movie's main message is that humanity's problems are complex and unique, and we should perceive them as such to be able to help those that have been marked for life like Dave. Sean in a sense is that archetype of the man that seeks to defeat complexity and find truth and justice. We also get emotionally involved in his journey to seek redemption and forgiveness and he finds it by capturing the killer and getting back with his wife.The movie maintains a tense atmosphere intertwining the stories and helping us understand how people can connect with each other at different levels. It explores counterfactuals in a way that makes us use our imagination of how the stories could have been different for every character. We end up with the idea that anyone of them could have been the person abducted and that in life the weak die and the strong live, arbitrarily.",

In this case the film is about unspoken pain and secrets, about unvoiced suspicions, both spiraling down through the decades (quotation from the review by Roger Ebert).Clint Eastwood made the right choice, but he could only do so relying on three very good actors doing a very good job. In my opinion it is beside the point trying to establish if Sean Penn (\"Dead man walking\", 1995, Tim Robbins), Tim Robbins but now as a actor (\"The Shawshank redemption\", 1994, Frank Darabont) or Kevin Bacon (\"Apollo 13\", 1995, Ron Howard) made the best performance.

Overcome with grief and anger Jimmy Markum, played by Sean Penn, takes it upon himself to find his daughter's killer.Katie Markum, Jimmy's daughter, played by Emmy Rossum, is killed at the very beginning of the film, at the tender age of 19. Her father who feels as though he knows his daughter better than any other, only truly learns about his daughter's second life after her death. One of the Investigators on the murder case and child-hood friend to Jimmy is Sean Divine, played by Kevin Bacon. When the investigator begins his work to try and figure out what really happened to Katie Markum, he unveils her secret love affair with Brenden Harris, played by Thomas Guiry. The two were set to leave for Las Vegas to get married the day after Katie's death. The plot thickens when a flash backs reveal a tragedy that happened to Jimmy Markum, Sean Devine and Dave Boyle, played by Tim Robbins. All three boys were friends when they were younger and one day when playing in the street, Dave is abducted by a strange man pretending to be a cop. Dave ends up going missing for days and only returns when he escapes from his captures. Ever since the experience when Boyle was a boy he has never quite had the same demeanor. When Dave Boyle is one of the last people to see Katie Markum alive, he becomes a prime suspect to the police and to Jimmy Markum.This film did a phenomenal job of displaying the grief and anguish a parent faces when they lose a child. As a viewer you can almost feel Jimmy Markum's pain and suffering when his daughter is slain. Moreover, the complicated relationships between the 3 men who were friends as children make this film even more drama packed. Clint Eastwood did a fantastic job directing the A-list stars in the film in expressing the overbearing and powerful emotions that make this film a hit! I could not tell you one single thing that this movie did wrong or that could have been improved. Clint Eastwood and cast perfected this movie and nothing could be changed in order. Even the film's tone and scenery changed from the begging to the end, utter genius. At the beginning of the film, the lighting and shots are bright and cheery and at the very and the shots are darker and somber. Beyond a doubt, true perfection.If any Oscar should go out to anyone in this film it should definitely go to Tim Robbins. Robbins portrayal of an adult, whose childhood experiences shaped his adulthood nightmare, was absolutely unbelievable. The actor couldn't have depicted his character any better. The role was absolutely the most challenging role of the entire film, and he nailed it.Mystic River hit the nail on the head. The combination of A-list actors and director and well as a compelling plot, makes this movie a MUST see. All in all I would rate this movie a 10 out of 10 stars from its realistic interpretation of a murder gone awry.",

This movie HAS to have good acting or else the whole thing will just fall apart completely. This is very much a somber drama, a tragic tale of these old childhood friends. There are many difficult issues like sexual abuse, pedophilia, murder, and the loss of a loved one that happen in this film and its handled in a tasteful way. I'll admit that I didn't love this one as much as I thought I would, but I did enjoy it and admired the skillful way in which it was made.

The intriguing story grabbed my attention and rarely left my mind wandering off. While it's a well-crafted piece of work and features terrific performances from everyone in the cast (with Tim Robbins being the standout, followed by the always effective Sean Penn), it wasn't without its flaws. All things considered, I'd rate it as a good film, but not an excellent one. It's got a thick feeling of depression and drab misery to it which permeates, and while this is something I'd call a virtue to this particular story I'd also have to say it lingers too long. At something around 138 minutes in length, it's one of those pictures which may have benefited from a shorter running time.I also had a bit of trouble with the outcome of the movie, unfortunately. In particular, the Sean Penn character's lack of any real redemption, comeuppance or anything, really, after he learns what he did. It's not that I didn't \"believe\" the character could be so callous or indifferent, but that it didn't prove rewarding to me and ruined what might have been a great film. It felt to me as if there was something unresolved after all was said and done. *** out of ****",

It is one of Clint Eastwood's better films and most dramatic. Compared to Unforgiven, it is much more dramatic and real. Still, Mystic River fails to hold its audience close to its end. Like Sleepers, the subject matter of the post lifestyle of the abused is present. I was hoping for more side stories, and I got it.

It's his calmness, his embracing of family values in the middle of chaos, that is so moving. I really had a hard time witnessing the incestuous affection Jimmy (Sean Penn) had for his daughter, following his \"investigation\" and accepting his final \"mistake\", while Dave had all my sympathy. Although it seems Eastwood was more interested in Jimmy's character, \"Mystic River\" is a good movie with a first-rate performance by Robbins.

Sean Penn is stunning; one of the most vivid portrayals of grief on celluloid in recent memory.  It is almost painful to watch him cope with the murder of his daughter.  Everyone in the cast, in fact, is at the top of their game.  Tim Robbins turns in his best work in years, and it is good to see Linney and Harden  doing some strong work (in supporting roles).

            "content": "Three Hollywood powerhouses spar for screen time in this worthy but essentially cheerless yarn from director Clint Eastwood.Sean Penn, Tim Robbins and Kevin Bacon have racked up some impressive credits between them over the years so to cast them all together in a lugubrious, narrative-driven drama smacks a little of over-indulgence. These guys dominate every scene, squeezing out even their distinguished co-stars: Laurence Fishburne, Laura Linney and Marcia Gay Harden won't have found themselves on the support card very often in recent years. Clint, it seems, really knows how to drum up a decent cast. He has also well and truly hung up his spurs and holstered his .44 Magnum. Mystic River is a million miles from Dirty Harry or Unforgiven - this is slow and thoughtful fare that offers little in the way of audience satisfaction.Jimmy (Penn), Sean (Bacon) and Dave (Robbins) are childhood chums in Boston. After Dave survives a four-day ordeal of rape and torture at the hands of a local paedophile, the three drift apart. Their paths cross again years later when Jimmy's daughter is murdered. Dave, still suffering from the mental scars of his own tortuous past and now a paranoid schizophrenic, is fingered as a leading suspect, while Sean is the detective leading the investigation.Jimmy, a reformed gangster, trusts more in his own methods of retribution than those of the authorities and clashes with Sean who wants to do things by the book. Nothing original there \u0096 childhood friendships jeopardised by more complicated adult scenarios \u0096 the whole 'wouldn't it be easier if we could just put all our differences aside and have a nice game of street hockey like the old days' routine has been done to death over the years and much better than this, frankly.Stand By Me is probably the best example of the knowledge-through-experience idea, where kids are coloured by significant incidents in their youth and grow up subconsciously gripped by the past. Likewise, other films have dealt with child abuse more thoroughly than Mystic River: Sleepers, for example, is quite evidently a film of two halves: First come the pathos-driven scenes of cruelty and torture and then the predictable score-settling.This is where Eastwood is perhaps too subtle for his own good. The scenes of the young buddies, these comrades-in-arms, are all too brief. We know they are 'friends forever' because they write their names in the unset cement; we also know that Dave is pretty comprehensively screwed-up by his ordeal, and that his mates suffer from a form of survivor's guilt because it was him and not them. But we aren't shown enough to really care. Perhaps some of the poignancy is lost by not allowing the audience to empathise deeply with the characters' younger selves.Still, there is plenty to sit back and admire. Robbins' breakdown is slow and skilfully played while Penn's despair is graphically and intensely studied. For a good part of this movie, the two of them seem hell-bent on out-gurning each other. Penn cleans up on the anguished sobs and tearful resentment stakes, while Robbins delivers a masterclass in staring dolefully out of windows. It would be almost comical if it weren't so darn depressing.Naturally things build to a bitter and inevitably grim conclusion that Eastwood seems pretty pleased with as he drags it out way beyond what is strictly necessary.The whole affair is suitably gripping, well acted and commendably free from sentimentality. Indeed, there is a startling lack of incidental music throughout (which is a big bonus in my book). Instead, silence is used to great effect and gives a slightly sinister edge when scenes are teetering on the brink of melodrama. Well crafted it may be \u0096 but a barrel of laughs it ain't.7/10",

            "content": "It seems as though Clint Eastwood can do no wrong. After \"Rawhide\" he did Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns which proved he was a talented actor. It may have been \"The Outlaw Josey Wales\" that proved he had talent behind the camera. I would say that it was in 1992 when he did his crowning \"Unforgiven\" that Eastwood proved he was an all-time great. Luckily, he doesn't really excel more in one genre than another; all he tackles turn to gold (except for comedies). It seemed as though Eastwood could duplicate his golden statuettes with his 2003 adaptation of Dennis Lehane's novel \"Mystic River.\"To me, nothing in 2003 was going to compete with the third \"Lord of the Rings\" film: with deep characters and a fast plot, the movie ultimately pushes the boundaries of what the medium is capable of. But 2003 had other great films such as \"Lost In Translation\" and \"In America,\" but it seemed as though \"Mystic River\" would be the closest to give LOTR a run for its money. Well, it was about to be one of the best, but the end happened.One day in a Boston neighborhood, preteens Jimmy, Sean, and Dave are playing on the streets when a car pulls up. A man gets out pretending to be a police officer and puts a scare into the boys. He orders Dave into his car. He is held captive for four days before escaping. The three boys' lives are forever changed: Jimmy is an ex-con now running a grocery store; Sean is a police detective; and Dave is introverted and noticeably scarred.As adults, Jimmy's (Sean Penn) oldest daughter Katie is found brutally murdered on the day of his other daughter's first communion, Sean (Kevin Bacon) is assigned to the case and Jimmy confides in Dave (Tim Robbins). What Jimmy doesn't know is that Dave saw Katie the last place she was seen alive, and he arrives home with covered in blood.The movie is split equally into two genres that elicit strong emotions. Sean, along with his fellow detective Whitey (Fishburne), investigating this case is captivating. Sean is not convinced that Dave is the culprit, but Whitey is. To make matters worse, Dave's own wife (Harden) doesn't even believe him. What is Dave tea is the killer?As a dramatic film, Sean Penn and Tim Robbins winning the Oscars in their respective categories was pretty easy. Each character is fully fleshed out and very deep. No easy answer is given.Sounds amazing so far eh? Well the final ten or fifteen minutes is not worthy of the excellence displayed throughout the film before. Jimmy is completely convinced that Dave killed his daughter, and in one of the most chilling scenes Eastwood has ever filmed, kills him. At the same time (a crosscutting scene is what it actually is), we find out who actually killed Katie. Sean finds out it was Katie's fianc\u00e9e's brother and his friend that were just being stupid. Really? What a weak explanation! But I don't blame Eastwood, I blame the man that wrote the original source. Furthermore, Sean tells Jimmy the next day that the real killers are now behind bars after explaining what happened that fateful night. Jimmy shows little remorse for killing his innocent friend who he now knows was in cold-blood. Again, bad move for turning Jimmy into someone so psychotic and unlikable in a matter of minutes. And that's not all! Jimmy's wife (Linney) has a pep talk with him, basically saying she's proud of Jimmy killing Dave. What!? Really!? Finally, during a parade, Sean-who has figured out Jimmy killed his former friend-sees Jimmy in the crowd and they exchange gestures: Sean pretty much saying \"I'm coming for you\" and Jimmy taunting him. What!? Again, blame the writer! Eastwood could easily have done justice if the last few minutes were better.At 138 minutes in length, I am just so happy that roughly 120 of those minutes were some of the best in the careers of those involved. If those last few minutes were actually good and not despicable, this would easily be a masterpiece at the highest order. But the way it stands I cannot give this entire movie a perfect score.3.5/4",

Sean Penn is predictably great in his portrayal of Jimmy Markum. It's a difficult character, a person you really don't know what to think about.

The rest of the cast is solid, with Kevin Bacon the brightest star among them.When it comes to the plot itself this was where much was changed from reading the book. The trick is not to watch this as a crime-drama. Rather it's a movie about behavioral patterns, about humans. What they are capable of and what dictates their actions. There are huge amounts of sadness and melancholy to this story. Of people unable to break out of the path it seems life has chosen for them.

Both Sean Penn and Tim Robbins took home the Leading and Supporting Actor Academy Awards respectively for their work in the picture, and while their performances are solid throughout the film(Robbins in particular) it's one scene in particular that garnered them the award.

            "review_title": "Clint Eastwood's Best Film",
            "content": "On the long list of actors turned director, Clint Eastwood certainly ranks among the top. His name is often uttered in the same breath as John Cassavetes and Laurence Olivier though for what it's worth Eastwood's personal brand of pulpy anti-hero bravado gives him a certain edge among a certain crowd of movie-goers. At his best as a director, Clint Eastwood's eye for worts-and-all Americana, sense of wistful dream-diverted story-lines and serious appreciation for great acting make him a singular standout among Hollywood. Even when he's resting on his laurels with mediocre crime dramas and phoned-in music appreciation flicks his humanism always shines through. While some may cling to Best Picture winner Million Dollar Baby (2004) or the biographical (not to mention controversial) American Sniper (2014) as the best Eastwood's ever done, allow me to kindly veer the heads of the undecided masses to take a look at Mystic River.The film starts with three boys playing hockey on the streets of Boston circa 1975. A man in uniform approaches and coaxes one of them into an unmarked car with a priest sitting uncomfortably in the passenger's seat; they drive off. A few days later the boy escapes the clutches of the two men though not before suffering sexual abuse in a damp, windowless basement. We then fast-forward to the present. The boys have grown to become Detective Sean Devine (Bacon), working-class stiff Dave Boyle (Robbins) and Jimmy Markum (Penn) an ex-convict who runs a neighborhood convenience store. Despite not talking to one another for years, the three are thrust into a crime- drama involving the murder of Jimmy's beloved teenage daughter (Rossum).The screenplay written by Brian Helgeland and based on a novel by Dennis Lehane is a marvel all its own. The plot twists and turns to the common treads of a typical crime story only with a dignified appreciation for character. Thus while a lesser screenplay may contort to fit a larger need or theme, Mystic River ebbs and flows allowing dramatic moments to truly resonate with the audience. Sure it's a mystery but it's a perfectly assembled chamber piece first and a mosaic of a city second.That mosaic of course can't be fleshed out without the pitch-perfect acting of everyone involved. Sean Penn is superb as Jimmy, a neighborhood king of sorts who's worldview is shrouded in gray. His vengeance and wrath inform many of the film's largest moments coating a father's desperation with an ambiguous authoritarian edge. There as his fulcrum is Laura Linney as wife Annabeth whose grief hides a mind much like Jimmy's. The couple's foils are Dave and Celeste Boyle (Gay Harden) who likewise give in award-worthy performances. Dave's past as the victim of sexual abuse smothers all possible relationships marking him an outsider in a neighborhood he's never left. His only solace, Celeste carries herself as if she were always wearing a rain-soaked pea-coat. She tries her hardest to open him up emotionally yet years of marriage have yielded a devastating emotional and physical toll.Even Emily Rossum the little-seen victim is given time to shine as a petulant daughter who craves not so much approval from her father but respect for her choices. She along with Laurence Fishburne round out the named cast though let us not forget the background, no-name characters of Mystic River who sell the movie without even trying. The bleak workmens' affectations of East Boston's bars, storefronts and hobbles are supplied with pockmarked realism best typified by anonymous character actors such as Kevin Chapman and Jenny O'Hara. The subtle ensemble of players in Mystic River add a certain texture that rivals the en masse of a George V. Higgins novel.I realize I've talked a lot about the acting but it's just that kind of movie and Clint Eastwood is just that kind of director. He doesn't just present characters as empty vessels we can pin our hopes to, he reaches deep into a character's very soul and puts their motivations on the table without pretense or concern for whether an audience will \"go there\" with them. Even his less celebrated films have this in common thus guaranteeing that the fault lies squarely on technical missteps. Mystic River however is likewise an excellent exercise in film technique expertly pulling back when it should and emphasizing when it should. We partially have cinematographer Tom Stern to thank for that, though let's not undersell Eastwood. He has been a Hollywood icon for nearly sixty years after all.Mystic River is a near-perfect Hollywood drama that employs all the best aspects of modern filmmaking. It's perilously entertaining, uncompromisingly bleak and a splendid mix of old-fashioned tragedy, smart mystery and subtle character study. Is it any wonder that the film was nominated for five Oscars, winning two for actors Sean Penn and Tim Robbins?",

It's however a complicated story, with persons definitely not in black and white and it puts complicated questions about a complicated morality.Besides it is very well performed, especially by Sean Penn and Kevin Bacon, but also by the rest of the cast. Penn is all the movie on the level to explode while Bacon is acting by small means, concerning his way of speaking, looking at people and so on. He is also near an explosion, but it isn't that obvious.You feel quite uncomfortable together with all these tough feelings and you will definitely not feel unshaken when you leave the movie house. Probably Clint Eastwood's best film so far. He is really getting the respect he deserves now. Or maybe it hasn't been until now that he deserved it.",

            "content": "This should be a great movie.  As most people and reviews have mentioned, the acting is excellent.  The story is interesting, the cinematography is quite good, Eastwood's music works well... but there are numerous problems with this film, some of them serious enough to leave me fuming as I left the theater.  *SPOILERS AHEAD*1) Motivation - After spending almost the entire movie showing Sean/Bacon (and Whitey/Fishburne) methodically and doggedly looking for the murderer, suddenly, Bacon goes against his carefully developed character and appears disinterested in the investigation and happy to take care of his domestic problems.2) What happens to Whitey/Fishburne? - Even if Sean/Bacon dropped the ball on the investigation for private reasons, what about Larry?  He definitely doesn't seem to be the type to blow off the investigation, especially after all the work they had done.  Since this can't be plausibly explained, he simply vanishes from the film.3) The lips - The character of Sean/Bacon's wife may have played a larger and better role in the book, but she and those incredibly annoying lips should have been axed from the film.  A sappy ending to this sub-plot too. And only one half-second after the cathartic zenith of the film, Bacon's back on his damn cell phone, the lips return... but now all is okay. Terrible directing at this point.4) Subtle Names - The Savage Brothers.  Officer Divine.  Beat us over the head any harder and we'll have to sue for damages.5) More subtlety - Yeah, yeah, Dave/Robbins is back in the car again.  We get it, we get it.6) Motivation Part II - By the end of the movie, we realize that Jimmy/Penn is just a thug, and not a particularly smart one at that.  He's even got his two stereo-typical goons working for him.  But we've been emotionally manipulated for two hours to feel sympathy for him.  Why?  This film really isn't a tragedy, as many people are claiming.  We've simply been tricked.7) Therapy - Despite obviously thinking about his situation obsessively for decades, Dave waits until late in the film to tell his wife the most important thing that ever happened to him?  How long have they been married? Has he never heard of therapy?  Do they not have therapy in Boston?  Does that explain Pedro Martinez?8) Two-dimensional - Dave and Celeste are ultimately pretty flat characters. Robbins does an amazing job with his role and impressed me with his range more than Penn, who seems to do his normally good acting.  But he and Marcia Gay Harden really don't have a lot to work with.9) The killer - I can't believe I'm the only person in the world who suspected early on who the guilty party was going to be.  So, if that happens to you, the film is going to be less interesting.  This ain't no Usual Suspects.10)  Harsh world - It's hard to talk about the ending of this movie without completely telling people what happens, but I think the \"only the strong survive\" message is overdone and not accomplished so much through good writing as by toying with our emotions.  This is not a bad film - it's just getting a lot of tremendous press when it has some serious problems - that's my gripe.  But it has many good elements. The biggest surprise of the film was Bacon, who is not an actor I like.  I thought he did quite well.  And Fishburne is maybe the most enjoyable part of the film.  He may not stretch himself as much as the other actors do in this particular case, but he does provide the lighter moments, and it's a film that desperately needs humor.  See the movie for the acting.  One should probably read the book for the story.",

I find that much more impressive than line after line of computer generated soldiers doing battle, (if you know what I mean). This film was like a breath of fresh air to me, focusing on real, multi-dimensional people played by talented actors who know what they are doing. That's rare in the cinema these days.\nSean Penn is garnering most of the allocades and he is wonderful, his transformation into the DeNiro of his generation being now complete. The pain of a man haunted by the past and what he has become is evident in not only every scene but every look and gesture. This was the guy who played Spiccolli? But the best performance in the film is by Tim Robbins, as a middle-aged wreck of man whose life ended because of a childhood ordeal and who has been just wandering through life since. His hollowed-out eyes, the combination of defiance and resignation he has at the end is something very memorable.  The supporting cast lives up to their high standards. Laura Linney, with her `Lady McBeth' scene, (which should have come earlier in the film), Marcia Gay Harden as the wife who can't believe what her husband has done, Kevin Bacon as the cop who has to investigate his old friends and Laurence Fishburne as his partner who wants to make sure Bacon doesn't stray from his professional duties are all first-rate. Clint Eastwood's direction is evocative and lucid. The film, at 137 minutes, never drags and his juxtaposition of Penn's confrontation with Robbins and the similar confrontation between the kids is masterful. The atmosphere of the film is superb. Eastwood used to be thought of as the next generation's John Wayne. Can you imagine John Wayne doing `Mystic River'? And did you notice that he composed the score?Still, there are flaws, (POSSIBLE SPOIILERS)-\tWhy, oh why, doesn't the film end with Penn saying that they all got in that car? Surely Bacon would have taken him in at that point. What's with the parade at the end?-\tThe boyhood tragedy isn't really that strongly tied to the events of the present. Penn makes a speech that he wouldn't have become the guy he became without it. I wonder about that. -\tAs I mentioned, Linney's speech would have meant a lot more if it came earlier in the film, expressing support for Penn's actions before they found out they were wrong. By the time it happens, even Penn knows he's just created another tragedy. -\tThe Cross- it appears on the ring. It appears on Penn's back. What does it mean in the context of this story? Would Penn have gotten such an obvious symbol of his hidden pain etched into his body? Of course, he may not know that one of the abductors wore such a ring. But if that's true, why the tattoo?-\tWe don't learn much about the real perpetrators and their crime does not, in fact evolve from any of the personal dramas the movie concentrates on.\nBy the way, if you're like me, you like to rent more than one movie at a time, often with the selections having some relationship to each other. If you rent this one, look also for a film from two years ago called `In the Bedroom'. It contains many of the same elements, (although the neighborhood is certainly different).  The murder of a beloved child. Revenge by a character you can identify with if not really admire. The New England setting. Excellent acting and direction. Nothing is computer generated. Just people and their unvarnished truths.",

Now I'm being really generous by giving this movie a 7. Simply because there's nothing wrong with the movie in a certain sense. But it's unoriginal. I didn't find Sean Penn to be overly great. Although better than his reputation has allowed. He was a lot better in 21 Grams. Much better script to work with. I was impressed with a lot of performances in 21 grams. (except the title.)Tim Robbins was okay, Kevin Bacon was a bit too much of a statue.But it was a mostly dragged out movie with a very good last half hour. Which is probably why I'm so generous. I say deceptive because looking at the ending is confusing. (via the cheat method. look at the ending first) At one point thru the cheat method it became obvious to me at the time that Tim Robbins did it. But watching the movie right, this was not the case. Frankly that wife of his, though playing a sympathetic person.. got her husband killed. The very end though I found to be wrapped up way to fast.

            "content": "The usual Hollywood fare of violence in movies consists of serial car crashes, shootings, beatings, and knifings that most people are pretty much inured to emotionally.  Mystic River, however, directed by Clint Eastwood, does not allow your senses to get off that easily.  For many, there may be a disturbing price to pay. The movie focuses on three men who live, love and die in the blue-collar old neighborhood of East Buckingham in Boston.  The film opens on the trio as eleven-year old boys playing stickball in the streets.  SEAN PENN plays tough-guy Jimmy Markum, KEVIN BACON is Sean Devine, and TIM ROBBINS is Dave Boyle, who is forced to take a ride with two pedophiles who would change all their lives forever.  Dave ultimately escapes after a four-day ordeal, however, the emotional scars are there to stay. Twenty-five years later, the three friends are thrust back together by another trauma-the murder of Jimmy's 19-year old daughter.  Sean, now a cop and his partner Whitey (LAURENCE FISHBURNE) are charged with solving this brutal crime.  They must also stay one step ahead of Jimmy, now an ex-con, who is driven to find his daughter's murderer. Dave, now barely coping in a fragile marriage to Celeste (MARCIA GAY HARDEN), cannot exorcise the demons of his childhood ordeal.  Sean is torn by old loyalties to Jimmy and Dave, yet doggedly gives no quarter in his quest for the truth. The complex interweaving of the characters as we delve deeper and deeper into their psyches is both riveting and chilling at the same time. Eastwood brilliantly crafts such a heightened sensitivity and emotional involvement, that the effect soon evolves to become like an acid bath upon our nerve endings. Jimmy's wife, Annabeth (LAURA LINNEY) presents a chilling performance as a wife standing behind her man against all rational morality.  Dave's wife Celeste carries off much of the conveyed emotion by a simple nod or distressed look that is expertly communicated by this versatile actress. Every actor, irrespective as to the minority of his or her role, is amazingly well performed and vividly portrayed.  All this attention to detail adds immensely to the realism and emotional connection to each of the players.  As the drama heightens to its climax, the brutality presented, although tame by objective contemporary cinematic standards, scorches the very fibers of one's soul, feeling much like falling into ice water in the dead of winter.  This is truly a masterpiece of filmmaking, however, for a sensitive and compassionate human being, a searing excursion into the bowels of angst and torment.  I would certainly keep the gentle hearted and the children at home.",

His son, Kyle Eastwood, also has composed a few great songs on the soundtrack, and Cosmo is one of them. A very cool jazz melody.

I can just imagine the studio executives going `hey Clint, you're going to depress the audience' and Clint replying `that's the idea, bub. The plot concerns three youngsters growing up in working-class Boston (south side?). The life of one of them, Dave (Tim Robbins), is irrevocably changed after he is kidnapped and held for a few days by two very nasty child molesters. As adults the three become involved again in the course of a murder investigation headed up by another of the three, Sean (Kevin Bacon) in the territory of the third, Jimmy (Sean Penn).The film takes a very strong stand against paedophilia and also, interestingly, vigilante justice. In the end justice is not done in a situation where it could have been. After all those films in which the (relatively) good guy took justice into his own hands, Ol' Clint is now saying `support your local sheriff.' Perhaps his spell in elected office (Mayor of Carmel, California) has had something to do with this.The acting is fine, particularly Sean Penn as Jimmy the local storekeeper/hoodlum who has a complex range of emotions to go through. Tim Robbins as Dave came over as a shellshock victim but Kevin Bacon was excellent as Sean the persistent, if not perfect, detective. There are also fine supporting performances from Marcis Gay Harden as Tim's wife and Laurence Fishburne as Sean' sceptical sidekick (though anyone as sceptical as he was wouldn't last long as a sidekick).The atmosphere, helped a lot by the locations, was suitably gloomy and gritty, and Clint has used a few of his signature devices such as the camera going for a brief roam over the landscape (and harbour scape) in between scenes. It's not a happy story, but it is a gripping one \u0096 anti-Hollywood but with box office appeal. I guess once you get to Clint's age with his experience you might as well follow your instincts about what works in a movie. The execs can go sell the ice creams.",

It looks like a stage drama rather than a movie. All major incidents are hidden. Story also itself is very complicated and confused. I actually did not well understand what was going all over. Perhaps I should have watch it twice but I have no patients to see such boring movie over 2 hours repeatedly. As it is taken from novel then it must be cinematic version when making movie. If you do not take advantage of filming camera to tell story interestingly then what is use of such powerful media? We may watch a stage drama is better way. I think Clint Eastwood failed here other wise he has directed many best movies like Million Dollar Baby, Gon Torino and The Mule. Whatever was but as me this is very boring movie despite good acting by leading actors. Nothing to say more about.",

            "content": "An intense film founded on the slow character and plot development of the Dennis Lehane novel of the same name, Clint Eastwood and the cast convey an emotional depth rarely seen in cinema. The mystery film concerns itself more with the inner depths and mysterious developments of the small community, reflected in the Mystic River, rather than the large overarching case that catalyzes the ensuing events. This is what makes the cinematic masterpiece so beautiful. Each character, each event, each scene, and each tiny detail exist for a reason, paralleling the enormous themes of the film. Mystic River is bigger than the movie itself; it conveys meaning directly to the viewer with vivid emotion.Eastwood works to slowly build his film from the bottom up with carefully constructed tiers: plot, character, time-line, etc. Masterfully inserted flashbacks effectively connect the past to the present in a community where the present is the past. But the powerful performances from the entirety of the cast finish Eastwood's emotional drama. Sean Penn and Laura Linney form the powerful duo of a hurt couple full of love, hope, and purpose. Penn, Robbins, and Bacon make up the childhood trio tied together by an unforgettable past; an emotion seen in the atmosphere of their scenes together. And Penn and Robbins deliver spectacularly in their awkward, suspenseful, misinterpreted, fateful scenes together that shape the entirety of the film and the relationships of the characters in it.Helgeland masterfully adapted Lehane's immense novel into a brief two hours of intensity. The majority of the novel's theme, characterization, and nuance were transferred into the film through dialogue and acting. The characters came alive and the actors became the characters. The fateful story playing out in the piece transcended the screen, taking refuge in the rivers of reality, slowly washing over and then, breaking wave after wave on the viewer.Mystic River is a cinematic masterpiece to be remembered for centuries. It provides a piercing view into community, fate, love, and the effect of the past. It makes simple statements engulfed in reality to create an artistic perfection. The final product is art; the post-production was art; the filming was art; the development was art. And it simply says that fate is fate and Boston is Boston.",

            "content": "Mystic River investigates the effects of one fateful car trip many years ago and its effects in the adults that manifested from them. If Eastwood had wanted to complicate things he might have given further identities to the young Jimmy, Dave and Sean, and asked us to ponder the differences in the years. But they are only kids, and still have so much time to develop, so Eastwood doesn't make mountains of molehills (the defiant one of the three, for example, could have had implications in the future). The film falls short of being a masterpiece because it inevitably bogs itself down in the detective story of it all - the whodunit aspect and the police procedural investigation. Sean in these segments becomes less a character and more a uniform, with his straight-forward, no nonsense approach which curiously render him rather removed from the emotions of the whole affair, or at least compared to the turmoil that is thrust onto Jimmy and Dave. A better film might have shifted from that traditional Hollywood concern which is so determined to provide answers and instead explore the fractures the car trip has created in the extended lives of the three. Another fault is that Eastwood spends the majority of his time on the three, but seldom puts the extended cast into focus. For Sean, he is reeling from the aftermath of a divorce, but this is scarcely addressed after his introduction and then magically resolved in the end. How powerful might Laura Linney's magnetic, macabre approval have been if a precedent had been established? If we saw the deep-seated emotions she praises in her husband, if her character had been afforded any relevance in the story previously? These closing moments feel tacked on, as if Eastwood felt the need to broaden his narrative but only realised too late.So he builds the film from the bedrock of two powerhouse and academy award winning performances. First is Tim Robbins. He is, in a sense, playing two characters. The frightful and abusive past revealed through brief flashbacks allows us to be alert of its presence in his adult persona. The further we get in the film the more often it emerges. Robbins slips in and out of that child, trapped in the basement and in his own mind, blithering and babbling and reverting back into that shell. So in a way, when Jimmy answers that he last saw Dave years ago in that car, he is telling a truth. Penn's performance is not only driven but controlled by emotion. When he sobs for his daughter, he is at his most genuine, but for the rest of the film his mind is riddled with mistrust and paranoia and wrath. He becomes the best example for how the kids and community witness a trauma, and not fully understanding it, mark Dave from that day forth as damaged. Tragically, the truest image of them all is in the end, simple scrawlings in wet cement, weathered by time and lies.",

            "content": "The cast in this film is what sells the film the best. Given the sensitive mood of the plot, actors like this were needed for its success. They deliver that in gold in Mystic River (2003). Its not so much the plot of the film, that needed to be emphasized, as much as, delivering the powerful, emotional shock, that propels the film along. Clint Eastwood always directs his films with a meticulously styled plot, in favor of action. Action is more of an ingredient found on his acting resume of films. His directing has a more informative pace to it, sprinkled with high energy points.Its a delicate plot, that takes advantage of its mature R-rating, dealing in murder, kidnapping and unscrupulous behavior. It revolves around three characters, who's lives are changed forever, during a four day nightmare, back when they were teenagers. One of them gets kidnapped by two men pretending to be police officers, but returns home after the four day ordeal. With the plot of the prologue established, the film jumps about 25 years into the future, with the boys, now middle-aged men, living completely different lives. History unfortunately repeats itself, when tragedy strikes again, as the daughter of one of the men, is brutally murdered in the zoo. This sets off a whole new chain of events, that bring out the nightmares of the past, as everyone tries to solve, who murdered the girl.Giving an incredible performance, as usual, is the father of the victim, Sean Penn as Jimmy Markum, the owner of a corner store, who fractured a couple laws when he was younger. As a kind of contrast to Jimmy, Kevin Bacon plays Sean Devine, who is now a police detective trying to solve the murder case, along with his partner, Whitey Powers (Laurence Fishburne). Rounding out the three main characters, is the one who was kidnapped, Tim Robbins as Dave Boyle. Robbins gives an amazing performance, of a man tormented by his nightmares, trying to be a father himself and definitely effected by his traumatic past. The film shows the brutality, as well as, the frailty of the human experience. The film is a good mystery too. It does something different, by not emphasizing too much who is the killer is, but who is not. It is a clever plot and it is no wonder why both, Sean Penn and Tim Robbins won Oscars for this film.8.7 (B+ MyGrade) = 8 IMDB.",

Thankfully, this season seems to be ripe with films that focus on characterization and story, and Mystic River seems to be leading the pack.  With a phenomenal cast that deserved every award nomination and win they earned, Mystic River is a film that actually grew on me more in the days after I saw it than when I initially left the theater.\n*Possible Spoilers*Sean Penn, as the very flawed and grieving father who loses his daughter after she is murdered is amazing in this role.  He was afforded many accolades and much buzz, and I actually firmly believe that while his win was predictable, it was also very deserved.  Also deserving was Tim Robbins as the broken man who becomes a suspect in the murder. Sean Penn's performance was emotional, but Tim Robbins' performance made me weep in the theater.  In general, this was a very strong cast.Unfortunately, Eastwood tended to get a little heavy-handed at times.  For example, the sense in which we see Penn's daughter before her murder, we see this overly vivacious, affectionate and charming girl \u0096 it's as if Eastwood is saying, `Just in case you don't believe that it's a shame she dies, and just in case you don't believe Penn's grief, let's make her as charming as we can in the five minutes she's on screen.'  Penn's transformation from an almost professor-looking shop owner to thug is also remarkably quick, despite his former life and his suffered tragedy.However, despite its flaws, Mystic River is an excellent film.  Tragic and depressing, you will not feel good after seeing it, but its intensity is part of its appeal.--Shelly",

Here he leaves the scene open for brilliant actors, something leaving the movie open for as said, the actors!MYSTIC RIVER is based on the book, the novel written to the film is off course based on the book, this leaving Clint alone to make this movie. And it seems; like he has only followed the novel. A lots of the deep character info is gone, something that probably left a lots of the book-readers a bit frustrated. The story is fabulous and very interesting. Driven apart cause of a mental tragedy, the three buddies Sean, Jimmy and Dave leave still in the same neighbourhood, but has lost a lots of the contact from when they were kids. Sean has become a police detective, with bigtime problems with his wife, calling him every day not saying anything. Jimmy has a small shop but has been to prison and is still running the local areas with a small-time gangster league. And Dave, is very mentally disturbed after the kidnapping that happened to him. When Jimmy's daughter dies in a mysterious way, detective Sean is on the case while suspicion is put on Dave cause of odd behaviour. Sean Penn is absolutely amazing, but so is Robbins and Bacon, all performing great in every level. The movie is very gripping, and keeps always the feelings focused and this makes the movie very emotionelly correct for the characters situation. Penn's Jimmy that's totally messed up cause of his daughter Katie's death gets so deep into you that you wanna cry with him. MYSTIC RIVER brings Clint back on the top of movie making, because here he simply delivers everything you want. The great acting is very much of the movie's fascination, and not to forget Laurence Fishburne and Laura Linney, also doing absolutely great character performances! The movie is never purely exciting, but it's very dramatic and very interesting and kept me easily for the whole 2 hours and 10 minutes it rolls. The dialogs works brilliant, and this off course lots of the book's and actor's reasons, but the pure essence in this movie lays in the true mystique of it. Brilliant movie. STARS: 5/5",

However, there are numerous inconsistencies, notably in the relationship between Tim Robbins and his wife, Celeste. She more or less denounced him as the killer ! You don't do that to the husband/wife you love and it just doesn't ring true.Obviously there are plenty of red herrings to perturb the spectator, and credit must be given to the director for this. I just found the end not clean/neat enough and not tying up the loose ends as it should do.Eastwood's films are often pervaded by slowness and this one is no exception, at over 2 hours it was way over the mark and could have clocked in at under 1hr 40 mins if all the crap had been cut out from it.

If I tried to get in to all the plot intricacies it would take me a half hour to tell the basic storyline, but otherwise there was no way to give a real feel for the movie.  \"You have to watch it,\" I said.  I think this movie is on so many levels and with so much happening, a simple little summary doesn't do the film justice.Sean Penn, while I'm not completely convinced deserved an Oscar, did a wonderful job portraying the angst and desperation that Jimmy Markum feels. Kevin Bacon and Tim Robbins are spectacular in their supporting roles.  The cinematography from director Clint Eastwood is beautiful and the story is great.  There are so many things to like about this film that I found it impossible to not love it.The film is centered around three friends.  We see them in the movie's opening as boys playing street hockey in Boston.  Jimmy (Sean Penn), Sean (Kevin Bacon) and Dave (Tim Robbins) are just being boys when a man posing as a policeman comes and takes Dave away.  Dave is left in a cellar with only a sleeping bag and abused for who knows how long until he can escape. When Dave returns to the neighborhood one on-looker refers to him as \"damaged goods.\"Twenty five years later all three men still live in Boston, but their lives have taken them in different directions.  It takes a tragic event to bring them back together, when Jimmy's daughter is found dead.  Sean, now a cop, is working on the case and Dave, one of only a few people to see Jimmy's daughter that fateful night, is a prime suspect.Kevin Bacon does a great job portraying Sean, who doesn't let anyone into the inner turmoil of his life.  Occasionally you get a glimpse in, but that is it.  He pushes people away, including his wife.  Dave is portrayed by Tim Robbins who is able to play Dave perfectly.  Dave seems to have a burden on him at all times.  A man who was robbed of his childhood, it never seems as if Dave is always there.  Robbins is able to show how Dave is in a different world from everyone else.  He plays wiffleball with his son every day, and his son is the only one who doesn't see him as damaged.Overall this is a great film.  It's not typical Hollywood happy endings and makes you think long after the credits roll.9 out of 10.",

As we all know, anything Clint Eastwood touches is gold. This is a director that hasn't done a bad film yet. And it will stay that way. It took me a long time to finally watch Mystic River, but while watching it I asked myself \"Where have I been in the past couple of years?\"Mystic River is the story of three guys, Sean(played by Kevin Bacon), Jimmy(played amazingly by Sean Penn in his Oscar winning role), and Dave(played amazingly by Tim Robbins in his Oscar winning role). When they were younger, Dave was molested. Years later, Jimmy's daughter(played by Emmy Rossum) is murdered. This brings all of the guys back into each others lives. Marcia Gay Harden does a terrific job as Dave's wife, who suspects that her husband might have done it. Laura Linney plays Jimmy's wife. Sean is separated. Laurence Fishburne plays Sean's partner, because they are detectives.This is an incredibly powerful film. A very interesting one too.

While many lesser films display elements of contrivance and artificiality, every minute of this story rang true for me and the characters, especially Sean Penn as Jimmy Markum, came across as \"the real deal\": utterly believable flawed individuals. Highly recommended as both a murder mystery and moving character study.",

            "content": "In many ways, I didn't want to like Mystic River. I'm always wary when movies receive universal praise, and, although I wanted to see it, I actually hoped that I would be going against everyone. That wasn't the case (although it was with Blood Work, Clint Eastwood's previous movie: I loved it while everyone else didn't) here: I loved it as much as the next critic. I say this often, but Mystic River deserves acting Oscars. Eastwood's one fatal mistake was to not release this movie in December, when people would remember its acting. Now it will be lucky if it gets one nomination for acting.One day, three friends are playing in a street when one is abducted. He escapes four days later. Twenty five years later, all three friends are reunited. Jimmy's (Sean Penn) daughter Katie (Emmy Rossum) is murdered. Dave (Tim Robbins), who was the abducted child, who still lives in the town, becomes closer to Jimmy, and Sean (Kevin Bacon) is a cop investigating the case. It's more than just a murder mystery, it's a deep character study into the lives of three broken men.If you walk out of Mystic River hating the movie, you cannot deny that it had a cast whose acting prowess alone was worthy, and the performances the actors put in make the movie one of the best with the ensemble of actors. Each actor puts out an outstanding job, each better than the next. If I had to pick one person who did the best job, I would have to pick Robbins. His performance was so powerful and believable as a broken man. Next would have to be Laurence Fishburne as a police officer, maybe because I'm glad to see him in something other than The Matrix; he deserves better than that.Mystic River is one of those movies that are hard to put into words without sounding clich\u00e9d, but I'll attempt to anyway. I could call it powerful, which it is, but everyone else has said that because they too are at a loss of words. It's really an experience you have to see to understand. The mystery of the whole movie (who the murderer was) was done very well; I'm not sure who contributed to it more, Eastwood or screenwriter Brian Helgeland, but it was seemed that every person in the town could have committed the murder. That's a pretty good trick.There are four things that really made this remarkable movie a little less. First was how much Robbins and Penn looked alike (to me), so it was hard to tell them apart. Many characters were underdeveloped, such as the Savage brothers, and since they were crucial to the plot, it didn't really work. It seems like there were a few scenes taken out, especially about the Mystic River, which is only referred to once or twice. Maybe there's more references in the book. Lastly, and most importantly, when the killer was revealed at the end, it was done in such a nonchalant way it doesn't sink in and have the impact it should. If you can overlook those few things, then chances are you'll love Mystic River.My rating: 8/10Rated R for language and violence.",

But It moves at a snails pace, and can't seem to make up it's mind whether it's a character study or a a typical crime drama. Sean Penn who in my estimation is an over rated actor,does a good job with this, probably because he didn't have to far to go, he just plays some grumpy guy, kind of like what Harrison Ford does, but everyone else seems bored, and when I saw this in the theater the audience barely applauded when it was over. I certainly didn't. Don't understand how classic movies get 5-6-7 stars and this thing get's 8. it is what it is.",

Sean Penn and Tim Robbins have earned their Oscars. How does Tim Robbins pull it off every time? Truly gifted actor. The bluish tint in each frame works really good for the feel of the movie. Now, the cons. The story. Had it not been this amazing cast, the movie was meant to be a disaster. *Spoilers* Denise Lehane tried to pull a \"Shutter Island\" here or something. He wanted not-so-normal climax so bad, that he literally messed up the all potential classic. A murder is being investigated in the whole movie and another is somewhat justified in the end. A caring father was always a gangster, can be digested (If you really try hard). But what about the man who puts his duty above the friend, how can he be at peace knowing about a murder, just because it's done by so called coward of a king. In the end, one line concludes it all: \"Jimmy should have gotten into the car, instead of Dave\"",

            "content": "So the big question is does Clint Eastwood's \"Mystic River\" deserve all the Oscar Buzz and lavish praise from critics?  Well, the answer, just like the answers given to many of the seedy dilemmas in this film about dark secrets amongst three friends reunited for the first time since childhood after one's teenage daughter is brutally murdered, is a difficult one.  Yes and no.  I think the reason \"Mystic River\" has been praised to high heaven is that is represents the kind of old fashioned film-making so many critics wish Hollywood would return to.  This is a slow, dark, quiet, and morally ambiguous murder mystery directed by a beloved veteran (Eastwood) who really hasn't directed anything of substance in nearly a decade that serves as an acting showcase for some of Hollywood's finest performers.  It's solid entertainment for adults.  It's a competent, character driven adaptation of a best-selling suspense novel.  And most of all, it makes the audience think.  We think about the plot points, many of which have holes you can drive a truck through.  We think about character motivations.  Why did Sean Penn's character do that?  Why did Marcia Gay Harden's character not trust her husband (Tim Robbins)?  We think about the director's motivations.  Why was the lighting so dark?  Why was the music score so simple (yet oddly beautiful)?  We think about the point of it all.  We think what were they trying to convey here?  Is there any moral after all the misguided revenge and cover-ups?  Also, when was the last time you saw a thriller end with a climax that attempted to reach the level of Shakespearian tragedy and ALMOST succeed?  It may not be great film-making in that it comes up short, but it sure is good, and you have to celebrate it for trying.  So if heaping a film like this with too much praise leads people into the theater to see it, which in turn gets Hollywood to consider making a few more films like this instead of the homogenized drivel we normally see, then I'll be the first in line to rave about \"Mystic River.\"",

The Savage brothers, neighborhood thugs and friends of Jimmy, begin their own search for the killer, so they can let Jimmy get his revenge, while Detective Sean Devine works to solve the case and handle Jimmy's rage.  \"Mystic River\" is a dark masterpiece, expertly crafted and directed by Clint Eastwood, and superbly acted by Penn and Bacon, with the possibility of Oscar considerations.

            "content": "There's the well-known gibe about an incompetent general 'snatching defeat from the jaws of victory', and although director Clint Eastwood has not exactly served up a turkey, the final ten minutes of Mystic River to force one to ask: what on earth was he thinking? The film could, if you allow the conceit, be seen to follow the 'arc' of tragedy, with everything coming to a head in the fourth act, and the final fifth act settling things, acting as a kind of resolution. In that case, Eastwood's \u2013 or was he perhaps following studio orders? I very much doubt it but it would be only fair to ask \u2013 produces a spectacularly inappropriate final act, which doesn't exactly ruin the film, but does make it rather less than it might have been which is very, very good indeed. I'm not one for recapping 'what happened', but briefly the abduction by two paedophiles of one of three young lads playing in the street is, in many ways central to the story (from the novel by Denis Lehane who also wrote the novel on which Shutter Island was based). The abducted lad (Tim Robbins) never really recovers from his ordeal, and although that is not the central theme of the film, it is a crucial plot point. Meeting the three lads and witnessing the abduction works as a prologue, and we are reintroduced to them later in life. The abducted lad has become a handyman who has never worked the evil he was subjected to out of his system and in a curious plot twist this leads to his death. The second of the lads (Kevin Bacon) ends up as a homicide detective whose pregnant wife has left him, and the third (Sean Penn) has become a corner shop owner after a shaky start in life in which he served two years in jail. It would be futile to try to outline the plot further, as it is so intricately and cleverly. But I should add that the daughter of the corner shop owner is found beaten to death and the lad who became a homicide detective is assigned to the case alongside his sergeant. The handyman is briefly suspected of the murder after his alibi on the night comes into question, and his troubled behaviour leads to his death. Although Mystic River (and I have yet to understand the significance of that title) is partly a straightforward and very good mystery thriller as Bacon and his partner (Laurence Fishbourne) set about solving the murder, coming across wholly unexpected evidence. Meanwhile, Penn, the murdered girl's father vows to find the killer himself (with the help of two criminal associates), and Robbins, who comes into the frame after having briefly been in the same bar as the murdered girl and later arriving home covered in blood with a shaky story about having been mugged slowly goes to pieces. But that's all I shall tell you and, really, as far as this review is concerned, that's all you need to know. So far so good, and Mystic River, which unsurprisingly is well acted, well plotted, well directed and well filmed seems well on its way to becoming something of a classic. But oddly it all goes very. Very wrong in two scenes which make very little sense at all. In the first, Penn's wife (Laura Linney.), who knows what her husband has done \u2013 he has killed someone \u2013 persuades him that it is all for the good and that it will make him a stronger, better man. The scene would, perhaps, had made more sense \u2013 though not a great deal more \u2013 had Eastwood somehow acquainted us more with Linney's character, but we doesn't. In this odd scene, she is portrayed as some kind of gangster's moll who feels she has to stand by her man and provide a little backbone. But apart from that scene being out of kilter with the rest of the film, it incomprehensibly tries to show Penn's character as some kind of heroic figure, when he is, in fact, nothing of the kind. By the end of the film we realise that he is nothing better than a small-time thug, so why Eastwood tacked on \u2013 and tacking on is what he seems to have done \u2013 the scene between Penn and Linney is bizarre. The second oddity is that Bacon's detective knows full well what has happened \u2013 that Penn has murdered the handyman \u2013 yet apparently is happy to let it slide. Or if not happy to let it slide, at least, somehow 'understands'. There is a suggestion that he intends coming after Penn at some future date, but the tone of the film doesn't suggest much urgency. Penn, the grieving, vengeful father of the murdered girl, it seems, is supposed to be rather heroic. Well, forgive me for disagreeing. It's always possible, that I have missed something, have misunderstood something, and that Mystic River, as conceived by Eastwood, makes good sense. But it's also possible that Eastwood has simply misjudged his project and tacked on an ending which might satisfy those who like a sentimental conclusion but which otherwise rather ruins what could have been very, very good. Finally, what was the significance of Bacon being reunited with his wife? Marriage and the relationship all three lads have, when grown up, with their wives, seems to be a theme, but I, for one, could not make head or tail of what it is supposed to signify. I would be obliged to give Mystic River 7/10 \u2013 it is exceptionally well-made and well acted \u2013 but I do feel the very odd ending spoils it all rather too much. Hence my rating. The average rating of 8/10 is fair enough if you want a rattling thriller, but rather OTT if you're a little more discerning. The odd ending does spoil it all rather too much.",

Did Tim Robbins kill Sean Penn's daughter or not?  The initial suspicion I had early in the movie was correct.  The plot is actually quite convoluted and takes advantage of too many far out coincidences.  But going into the third act, I felt cheated into being able to intelligently dissect what the answers are.  Out of the blue,  two side characters seen only a couple minutes throughout the film,  given no foreshadowing,  become the prime suspects. One thing that nags at you throughout the entire film is what possible motive Tim Robbins had for killing his best friend's daughter?  But, in order to sell the idea,  they have him in the same bar as her,  have him leaving the same time she did,  Tim kills someone the same time she is murdered,  then later starts to become wacko in order to get us to believe that he would confess killing her to Sean.  Why would Tim lie to his wife about killing a mugger instead a child molester?    What difference would it make?  When the very apt Kevin Bacon and Laurence Fishburne follow leads,  we are not given any hint of who the real perps are,  until minutes away from our surprise climatic ending. I felt short-changed in that respect,  where I invested nearly two hours of clues to come up with my guess at the ending,  only to have brand new information toss it out the window.  Of course,  movies aren't required to follow rules,  and sometimes it works to make the audience work a little bit to figure things out.  But here,  we are not given a fair chance.  Perhaps that was the point of the movie,  to change it from a perceived mystery into a character study. But I don't buy it.  Yes, Sean Penn and Tim Robbins,  along with the excellent dialogue and direction, deserve the critical attention it received.  But how about the movie audience,  we don't get our reward for investing our interest in the characters.",

This was especially disappointing because I thought Brian Hegeland did the impossible when he adapted L.A. CONFIDENTIAL into a film.  On this outing with Eastwood, their attempt at film noir was sluggish and pathetically laughable.  All the imagery was stilted.Despite spasms of emotion and violence, the film kept the same painfully monotonous pace.  The music was sappy.  The shots were generic with the exception of the use of dissolves.

Mystic River is haunting and melancholy, and the portraits it paints of Jimmy, Dave, and Sean will stay with you after you have left the theater. In a time when the goal of most movies is to offer instant gratification with no aftertaste, this quality should be both valued and praised. Mystic River has only one misstep, and that occurs at the conclusion (and is reflective of problems with the book's final pages). Instead of ending cleanly, at the point when everything is in place for the rolling of the credits, the movie drags on for two unfortunate, unnecessary scenes. Nevertheless, this is a top movie.",

            "content": "I went to see \"Mystic River\" for a few reasons.  Firstly, I like to see the Oscar Nominees before the Oscars, so I know what is really deserving on the Osar night.  I also wanted to know how much competition \"Lord of the Rings\" had, and how much competition Bill Murray and Djimon Hounsou had, in their nominated categories.  I wasn't expecting anything amazing, just the usual Oscar-contending type of movie.I left the theater amazed at such a great film.  I wasn't expecting much, and its power and magnitude totally surprised me (though I don't know why, I loved Eastwood's \"Unforgiven\").  Everything...everything about this movie was top notch filmmaking.  Eastwood's direction was great, his best film I think.  The screenplay was admirable, and the acting, well, the acting was the best part.  Now, I realize that Eastwood probably worked great with his actors, but watching them mingle and talk to each other on-screen...well, they're on their own level.The story of \"Mystic River\" focuses on three childhood friends, Jimmy, Dave and Sean, who's lives are torn apart when Dave is kidnapped by child molesters (in one of the most tragic, disturbing scenes in recent memory). Dave escapes, but they're permanently seperated...that is, until they're in their thirties, many years later.  Jimmy (Sean Penn) is an criminal-turned-family man who runs his own business now, Sean (Kevin Bacon) is a police detective with a wife who calls him but says nothing, and Dave (Tim Robbins) is a bar-hopping, depressed man who tries his best to love his family, but has never quite healed from the incident in the past.  When tragedy occurs and Jimmy's daughter is found murdered, the three are brought together, though not as friends.And from their, the story takes off.  There are many twists, turns, surprises and shocks, one of the better mystery movies.  The supporting cast gives it their all too, with Laurence Fishburne, Laura Linney and Marcia Gay Harden - in what is, along with \"Miller's Crossing\", her best performance.Other things worth mentioning: Penn's versatility - I've seen this guy playing so many different characters, he's really an amazing actor.  I wouldn't mind if he beat Murray at this year's Academy Awards.  Also, Robbins' performance was notable, though if he wins...I'd be disappointed (Djimon Hounsou did very well this year).  Bacon is likable for once, and, of course, Eli Wallach's fiery cameo appearance - the guy's what, eighty-seven?  I can't believe the guy's energy...Tuco never dies!And things I didn't like too much - the revelation of who the killer is.  I liked how they did it, but I thought making that person the real killer was kind of...a bad decision (but by then it was unimportant I guess).Definitely one of the best of the year, a recommendation to all, 8.5.",

Nothing much ever happened, that is, until Dave was forced to take a ride that would change all of their lives forever.Twenty-five years later, the three find themselves thrust back together by another life-altering event -- the murder of Jimmy's 19-year-old daughter. Now a homicide detective, Sean and his partner (Fishburne) are assigned to the case. They must also stay one step ahead of Jimmy, a man driven by an all consuming rage to find his daughter's killer. Connected to the crime by a series of circumstances, Dave is forced to confront the demons of his own past. Demons that threaten to destroy his marriage and any hope he may have for a future. As the investigation tightens around these three friends, an ominous story unfolds that revolves around friendship, family and innocence lost too soon. Mystic River 10/10",

They and this film are then showered with Oscars by a Hollywood establishment that has truly lost its balance, in a poignant nose thumbing gesture of a ceremony. For my own part I watched it with a clean conscience on HBO, so I didn't really pay for it, at least it didn't feel like I paid for it. Throw all of that rubbish aside and I must admit Mystic River is a damn good movie, although it falls rather short of classic or even memorable. But its good, and definitely superior to most of your other cinematic options. Nothing exactly bold and new in terms of story here. Film has a little State of Grace, Good Will Hunting, and a lot of Sleepers in it. Little too much Sleepers if you ask me, almost plays like a remake at certain points. What it does succeed in however is overall execution. The AllPro cast is expertly directed by Clint, who to me is truly the star of the film. Nice touch putting Eli Wallach in the film. go baby!!!",

            "content": "I missed this movie at the theaters so I was very much looking forward to seeing it last night on TV. I knew it had terrific reviews and won a couple of Oscar's - not that this by itself is a sign of particular artistic merits though... Well, back then I was sorry to miss it but now - I hate to admit - I'm quite happy I did because in the end, it turned out to be quite a letdown.Let me start with a few strong points: It is a slow paced movie, technically low-key, no fireworks, no explosions, no cool one-liners, no car chases, no showdowns, no CGI, no gadgetry. These days this is pretty courageous. In the credits, the list of stuntmen were only 3 names or so long and I still wonder where they were used. So Eastwood deliberately reduces the movie to its essentials: actors and script. And filming the whole thing. I think the art direction and cinematography is very well done. While I've never been to Boston, this blue-collar, unfancy neighborhood is coming across very well. Yes the atmosphere is pretty bleak and even depressing, but I think it fits well. I cannot find much fault with the acting of the protagonists. Yes Sean Penn is overdoing it a few times (crimesite scene, heavy breathings. I thought he might get a heart attack right there) but nothing to get too upset about. That he deserved the Oscar for this performance is certainly debatable - but then again see my Oscar comment at the beginning.Tim Robbins puts on the best performance of them all, certainly believable except for the scene with his wife later in the movie where he is trying to cry but ends up laughing... or was he laughing and tried to convert into crying?? Overall he's giving a credible beaten dog.Bacon is good but there is not much to his character that requires more than being a cop. He is certainly the least troubled of the three \"friends\".Fishburne is a very good actor. His cop is entirely believable, nothing overblown except the silly remark about being able to see whether a guy was in jail by the way he carries \"it\" between his shoulders.The women are portrayed weakly, though. Hayden, Robbins wife is utterly confusing. Why is she so nervous all the time, even at the beginning? I could not understand. Linney is a complete loss. She could just as well be left out of the movie, it would change nothing EXCEPT, thankfully, spare us the completely out of context speech at the end. What was THAT?? Well, we must have reached the bottom of our moral bankruptcy if we indeed believe this...It was great fun to see Eli Wallach in the liquor store. He must be old as Methusalem by now but actually looked pretty good still, and indeed was not senile at all :-). But why not credit him for this cute stunt??So we have good actors and good filming/art direction up until now. What's left? Music for once. Or the lack thereof. Please, Clint, next time hire a professional composer again and play your music to your children and grandchildren. But beware, they might not love you more for it... It may be interesting to attempt only one theme for the whole movie. But upon final reviews, somebody should have told you that it failed. The score was very boring. If you want to stick with only one theme, make some variations of it: key, rhythm, instrumentation. Check Bach or Beethoven for instance, and realize that you are not in their league...And finally the real culprit, the unsatisfactory script. I did not read the underlying book, but it is obvious that the film tries to string together too many twists and ideas with the result that many of them come out half-baked only or not at all. A few examples:Bacon and his speechless wife: Sure, the idea is to add \"depth\" to Bacon's character but it is done in a heavy-handed, inelegant way. Scrap these scenes! Instead, show Bacon how he looks at their picture more often, show Fishburne talking to him and Bacon being detracted by seeing the picture. Maybe show some happy (or ugly) memory flashback of his. The resolution as presented, with his wife regaining speech the moment he resolves the case is so far-fetched, so clich\u00e9d, so... CHEAP! Are we really so stupid to be treated in this way?? What was this finger-shooting gesture at Penn at the end? Why does Katie want to leave to Las Vegas to commence a new life?The worst offence of the script was to make a suspect out of Robbins in the first place. Nobody is EVER questioning his motivation for such murder: Not the cops, not his wife, not Sean Penn. Maybe he killed her because the girls danced on the bar and disturbed him watching baseball?? Gimme a break!! Or he does plan to get eventual \"revenge\" on Penn and waits for 19 years to finally kill his child. Of course not. He would have abducted here at the age of 6 or 8 or so. But this he did not. He is actually a very weak suspect. Anybody in his right mind would immediately see that.Were Penn (and/or Hayden) indeed so underlit NOT to make Robbins at least show them the body of the killed pedophile? Surely a true case of \"blind revenge\" in the most literal sense...I have more but I'm running out of space. There are many things I liked in this film. But the script is simply not good enough to make Mystic River a REALLY good film. A wasted opportunity, sadly so.",

Consequently the performances are universally extremely good, and mutual respect is going on with no one attempting to upstage anyone else - no egos on display here. The story is good, with decent enough plot progression which does start to plod a little in the middle but which does enough to keep you interested. The main problem with this movie is Eastwood's direction, which is really very bland. The cinematography is very insipid, and there are a few aerial shots which seem contrived and unnecessary. The general look of the film is a bit uninspiring. Eastwood needs to develop his own style rather than being so generic.Overall it's a decent enough story, but lacks killer punch due to a combination of the plod in the middle and Eastwood's direction.

These three peoples involvement in this film made the people at the academy salivate to such an extent, most sadly died and the rest where required to wear drips for a period of one solid month, pumping in a mix of water, extreme hypocrisy and stupidity. A hefty dosage.Anyway, this film is what you would rightly expect from these characters. Intensity and a certain level of ability. Sean Penn acts his role rather well and the same can be said for Tim Robbins and even Kevin Bacon. But the problem is very simple. This is so unbelievable it is very hard to get truly sucked in. The characters are extreme. Robbins character is meant to be a weirdo, a freak, yet he still manages to make a living, marry a fairly nice wife and father a well rounded son. Not what one would expect from a man who's childhood and subsequent life was ruined due to a dreadful 4 day experience. 'Damaged goods' is what he is referred to in the film I believe. Sean Penn does well as the grieving father. But the hints and insights he has into his daughters life are excruciatingly unreal. He can tell by a look. No Chance. His gangster past is also a miss for me. Terrible. Kevin Bacon does well. As well as he can but he's in no trouble. His parter is though. Lawrence Fishburne's character is so badly written and filled with clich\u00e9s its beyond belief. This is a huge let down and does drag the movie down somewhat. I don't know if everything is down to the poor writing but it is sickening. Poorly acted but with the material, what can you do. It seems that the realism that Clint and his chums went into this film seeking was never there to begin with. The story is weak. The murder mystery is far too easily solved and the actions of the characters can't even be attributed to desperation or to difficult childhoods. It fails in what is trying to convey. The truth. What these characters would do in this situation. It wouldn't happen this way. Its been down in many places before and the supporting characters seem very unbelievable. Shocking really.

The movie opens with Dave (Robbins) as a young kid, being abducted by what appears to be an officer. We later find out that this so-called officer is actually a pederast and abuses Dave, leaving him mentally scarred. The movie fast forwards to the present day, where we see these 3 characters living less than spectacular but normal lives. Jimmy owns a convenience store, Sean becomes a detective cop and Dave just a regular dad. We know Dave is a bit of a weirdo because of his abuse as a child, but apart from that, he looks and acts pretty normal, has a loving wife and kid. The story takes a dramatic turn when Jimmy's (Sean Penn) eldest daughter is brutally killed. MYSTIC RIVER now turns into a homicide investigation movie and prime suspect becomes Dave for reasons that you have to see. It is clear to the audience that, despite Dave's odd character, he is NOT the one who murdered Jimmy's daughter, yet, through out the rest of the movie, that belief is stained with Dave's more and more abnormal behavior.Although Sean Penn took the Oscar for best actor, to my belief, it was Tim Robbins show all the way. Penn did a much more dramatic and convincing role in 21 GRAMS than in this movie, although his acting is above average. Kevin Bacon also gives one of his best performances. It's an ensemble cast and it works well. MYSTIC RIVER is entertaining because it keeps you wondering through out the picture who did the murder and why. The ending is downbeat and un-Hollywood-esque, so it's not your standard fare drama with the happy ending, but by the same token, it leaves feeling you empty and wondering what was the moral of the story. This is a good movie, but I don't think it's Oscar material.8* out of 10*",

'Mystic River' is no exception to this rule.  This is Eastwood's most powerful film since since Oscar winning 'Unforgiven' in 1992.  Eastwood has said that he likes working with actors who can direct.  Here, Sean Penn and Tim Robbins, both of whom I hope will be Oscar nominees for best actor and best supporting actor, are former directors with Robbins getting an Oscar nomination for his work behind the camera on 1995's 'Dead Man Walking' when he directed Sean Penn who is also a fine director in his own way.'Mystic River' is the story of lower middle class people in Boston who have to deal with tragedies of the past and present.  Their lives are turned upside down as the past seems to affect the present and we see that wounds of the soul never fully heal in this life.  Sean Penn's 19 year old daughter is murdered and two police officers (Kevin Bacon and Laurence Fishburne) search for answers to this horrible crime.Tim Robbins gives the best performance in the film as a man trying to cope in his adulthood with being kidnapped, confined, beaten and raped as a child by two grown men.  His zombie like persona is astonishing to watch.  He has a constantly blank, meaningless expression to reflect the pain.  The torment and sadness in his life are something you would not wish on your worst enemy.Scripted by Brian Helgeland from the book by Dennis Lehane, 'Mystic River' is a cold, bleak, depressing but ultimately watchable and fascinating film dealing with powerful issues that affect everyday average people.  The film's character development leaves you feeling something strange.  You'll feel and perceive something about the characters Penn and Robbin play when the film is over as opposed to what you saw when the film's main strengths start coming through earlier in the film and I haven't seen that too often in the movies.",

At many times this film doesn't know what it wants to be, at one point it becomes a story of innocence lost, then it becomes a crime thriller, but it tries to be both at the same time never giving the audience enough time to breath and catch up.Characters life stories are crammed in with little time to develop leaving the viewer assaulted and hopelessly confused if they miss something.  A smarmy cliche ending doesn't help either, and the relationship Bacon has with his ex seems only there just so the director can force some sympathy on his character it is WAY too obvious.This film is incredibly uneven even with the very solid performances by Penn, Linney, Harden, Fishburne, Bacon and Robbins.  But many times they're just going through the motions and not connecting with the audience.  This film looks like one of those adapted to film novel type films where they tried to cram everything from the book in but tried to do it in a span of 30 minutes.I should have known this after seeing Unforgiven, cause it was the exact same feeling I had when I walked out of that picture.

            "content": "MYSTIC RIVER had huge potential.  The storyline is tremendous, the characters complex, and the conclusion powerful.  Furthermore, Sean Penn's performance is Oscar worthy.  Nonetheless, I felt the picture fell short in many ways:1) The portrayal of Katie Marcum and her friends seems unrealistic (note the girls reaction to Sean's interrogation).  In fact, the writer and director never take enough time to explore the relationship between Katie and her father.  The one scene they shared together was not adequate.2) Mr. Eastwood had problems pacing the picture.  For example, the juxtaposition of Brenan Harris' grief directly after Jimmy's grief is awkward.  3) Issues of tone haltered the film.  Is this a mystery or drama?  At times, when we're following Sean and Whitey's investigation, it feels like we're watching an episode of CSI.  However, when watching Jimmy deal with his daughter's loss, the story shifts haphazardly.4) The portrayal of Sean's estranged wife is poorly done and insufficiently resolved.     SPOILER!!!5) After getting to know Jimmy's character (especially his background and rabid anger), I thought he would've killed Dave immediately instead of making him admit it.6) Jimmy's wife's final speech is senseless.  With the knowledge that her husband just murdered a close family friend and will probably go to jail for it, she seduces him with an erotically bizarre \"king of the land\" speech.7) Although claiming to not be friends, Sean's indifference to Dave's death is incalculable.I haven't read Denis Lehane's original novel.  Therefore, I'm not sure if these issues are a result of the author, the screenwriter, or the director. Unfortunately, whatever the matter may be, I don't think MYSTIC RIVER deserved to be nominated for BEST PICTURE.",

In its present form, it tries spelling out too much.I'd read some critics' reviews calling this worthy of Oscars.  And it WAS good.  I'm a retired psychologist and family therapist so I've seen many times how abuse seriously effects even those who were not themselves directly abused, and how its consequences travel on for generations. So I can't think of a more deserving subject.  I think too often in screen plays and in stories, the motivations and decisions caused by ancient and previous plots are ignored.  As if each life starts out with a blank slate, jostles with some stresses, and writes up the results.  That's simplistic.  Always our slates have been much written on and previous words always intrude, unconsciously forcing us to change whatever we're writing to make their inclusion fit and seem logical.  I was hoping to see more of that richness conveyed in something other than just violating others.  Perhaps it was but in more simplistic cause and effect actions than I'd like. A usual hallmark of good and great movies for me is the extent to which scenes replay themselves, capturing the essence of an issue or a human situation or a question.  This movie didn't give me many.Perhaps because it tried to do two things -- flesh out an intriguing mystery on the skeleton framework of family dynamics (or vice versa, it's hard to tell which should be considered the frame and which the flesh).  And possibly because it covered the area of my professional interest and work, I'm much harder to please?  Many others will be far less demanding on that issue. Definitely not a pleasant, feel good film but worth seeing.  Good performances by the three male principals and others.  But, for me, it grasped far less than it reached for.",

When did character studies become too complicated for the average person to follow?Folks, this isn't a murder mystery.  This movie could have been about raising soybeans.  This movie is about PEOPLE.  What makes them good, what makes them bad, what makes them who they are, and how fallible human beings do stupid things that haunt them for the rest of their lives.  Good people do bad things, evil people live among us without being held accountable, bad guys don't get caught and there is no rhyme or reason for what happens in the world.The reason Larry Fishburne wanted to be in this film is probably because he wanted to be part of an experience that looks as though it was one of the more satisfying ones careerwise for just about everyone in it.  I agree, he is not used much, but it was nice to see him and Laura Linney even if it wasn't to great effect.Speaking of Laura Linney, her speech at the end is her attempt to justify her life and her place in it.  She judges her own cousin for her disloyalty instead of feeling anguish and compassion.  She is a woman who is committed to ignoring the sins of the past and of the present to protect her future. This is a theme throughout the film.  Many people have things in the past that bother them, and the film explores the consequences each person has to face--or chooses to ignore--because of what fate has visited upon them in their lives.This is a delicate, tiny film told in epic style in a very old-fashioned manner that credits YOU with having intelligence and patience.  Instead of whining that the ending is ambiguous, maybe take a minute and try to understand why the most deliberate and methodical of directors would choose to end the film in that way.  What is he trying to say?  That life is uncertain...that nothing is as it seems...that people are mysteries, that nothing can be taken for granted...it is a revelatory ending, in my opinion, completely perfect and utterly in keeping with the vagaries of the movie. You don't know what these people are going to do because they are REAL PEOPLE, not cardboard cutouts in a Hollywood studio executive's office being moved around to suit the plot.

Everyone else's performance is so forced (including Penn's) and unbelievable I was appalled. It's also very un-Clint-like in its choppy direction. Robbins was the only one who came close to the Southie accent, and even he was pretty far away. Not a single character engendered any sympathy, and there wasn't a moment of suspense or uncertainty.

But they are not simply performing at the level to which they owe their reputations.

Eastwood is clearly a director of immense sensitivity. For this alone, \"Mystic River\" is essential viewing.The pity of it all is that the material itself is way below the characters that people this pretty lame whodunit.

Slightly disappointing in that the outcome was a bit predictable fairly early on, but the acting is worth the entrance money.  A cast to die for!!. The first half of the film was the best, quite difficult to watch at times for its realistic detail. Sean Penn has had a lot of praise in the British press, although I thought the other three leading actors were just as good, particularly Kevin Bacon as the cop.  The biggest impression though for me was left by Marcia Gay Harden who I thought gave an Oscar worthy performance as Tim Robbins' wife.  Never has an actress acted so scared in a movie.

This intense drama about the investigation of the murder of a young woman will give you a ride on the emotion spectrum with the same intensity as in a roller-coaster. Slowly paced, beautiful shady photography, unforgettable performances by almost the whole cast will keep you entertained from the beginning to the end. The story is about three guys, Jimmy (Sean Penn), Dave (Tim Robbins) and Sean (Kevin Bacon), friends during their childhood days, not quite so after a horrible incident happen to one of them in their youngster's days. All of them lead completely different lives and although the live in the same neighborhood, they hardly talk to each other. Jimmy became a thieve and did some time in jail. Dave, who was raped by two pedophiles, now lives a quiet, insignificant life together with his wife Celeste (Marcia Gay Harden). Sean has a troublesome life since his wife abandon him, taking his newborn daughter along with her, though Sean's wife call him very often, she does not say a word to him on the phone, just listen Sean's voice. The night Katie, Jimmy's daughter, is murdered, she had visited the same bar as Dave, who later on the same night arrive home all freaked out with blood all over him and with a knife cut in his abdomen. When Celeste ask him what has happen to him, he only replies that he has been mugged and that he thinks he had killed the mugger. Dave, which I believe is one of the best performances of Robbins since the Shawshank redemption, becomes the audience's prime suspect but not so to detectives Sean Devine and Whitey Powers (Lawrence Fishburn) who are assigned to the case.As you already might guess, the movie is all about Sean and Whitey (ironically Afro-American) trying to crack the case. Nonetheless, Eastwood shows that he has the knack for directing flicks, and for storytelling. Mystic River is for me one of the best movies of the year, and I would not be surprise if Eastwood or any of the amazingly good main characters get an Oscar Nomination.",

The movie's strength is when it is focusing on its characters and the decisions they make based on trust and instinct.  More importantly, it is about the path one takes after making these decisions.  However, there is too much time focused on the whodunit part of the movie.  Maybe I concentrated too much on the mystery and a second viewing will change my mind.  But to be fair, once I was pretty confident with who I thought the murderer was, it was early on in the movie.  I had enough time to understand the film's meaning and to take in the performances without trying to play detective.  It just never reeled me in.  Eastwood does a good job of providing a depressing atmosphere and Penn does deliver a fine performance.  The rest of the cast holds its own and there is nothing offensive about the movie.  However, with all of the hype surrounding the movie, I came out of the theatre thinking it was just okay.  I think that Mystic River would have been more powerful and worthy of its praise if it had stuck with the evaluation of its characters rather than dedicating so much time to being a mystery.  7/10.",

I happened to be in London visiting family and my uncle suggested we go and watch a film and Mystic was the only decent film was on.  I didn't even know what Mystic River was actually about, only it involved the lives of three best friends but Sean Penn had made me trust this film to watch it and when I came out of the cinema I was buzzing with excitement of how good it was.The basic storyline is three young friends are playing outside on the road, one friend spots a cemented pavement which hasn't dried up yet and they decide to engrave their names in the cement.  Then out of the blue two men turn up pretending to be policemen and take one of the boys away and we shoot past four days later and they find the young boy and our only guess is he has been sexually abused and then we go on 25 years later and the three young boys are now all grown up living different lives until they are reunited by the tragic murder of Sean Penn's daughter and that's where the story kicks off but the movie is in full motion from the word go and you are pushed into these boys lives and it doesn't stop till the very end.   The characterization of this film is the best that Clint Eastwood has ever tempted, not since A Perfect world have I felt so sorry for a character in the way you feel about the characters in this film especially the great Tim Robbins who is on better form than he was in The Shaw shank Redemption as is Sean Penn which has to be the greatest performance of his career and Kevin Bacon is also excellent.   It's a shame that Marcia Gay Harden isn't seen in more films because I loved her in Millers Crossing so I hope after her role in Mystic River and her Oscar for supporting Actress a few years ago we will get to see her a lot more.   This is also another mile stone for Clint Eastwood as this is a subject matter which he has taken to a whole new level in his career but the whole film holds more punches than any film released this year and it's haunting soundtrack just puts it in perspective and makes this film a beautiful, moving, tragic and haunting Masterpiece.",

When watching a movie like this, where a huge focus should be put on all the little things and putting the story together, some deeper character involvement is necessary, for example, the Savage brothers seamed like a very interesting couple, on whom the movie's plot could have expanded, it would be more complex and interesting. Their background or further involvement could have been a great substitute for some of pointless conversations of the investigators.It is a great crime movie, set in a good place, interesting to watch, if you take out some of the illogical actions and flaws.",

            "content": "My Rating: ***1/2 out of ****. Mystic River is without a doubt one of the best movies of the year. In fact, it maybe the best I have seen so far. It has alot of strengths but it is not quite a masterpiece. Don't get me wrong, Mystic River is a great film but it has one significant flaw in it. Mystic River is a powerful, dark, and depressing film. Anyone who does not like dark films should best stay away. It features a powerful performance by Sean Penn. He shows such real emotion in this film. This will no doubt lead to his fourth Oscar nomination. Penn gives a brilliant, flawless interpretation of his character. Following Penn closely behind is Tim Robbins. Robbins performance is much more low-key than Penn's. However, its nearly as effective. His character has alot of pain inside. Because of Robbins we feel the pain he is going through. If he does not get an Oscar Nomination, it will be a damn tragedy because he deserves it. The third most effective performance belongs to Marcia Gay Harden. I am not as familar with her work but she was perfectly cast here. Her character is the wife of Tim Robbins character. She plays a scared housewife who is not sure if she believes her husband perfectly. The rest of the cast gives solid performances, although maybe not Oscar worthy. Laura Linney is solid, shes not in the movie for more than 10 minutes, but her speech at the end definitely is her high point. As much as I like Kevin Bacon as an actor, he will not get an Oscar nomination. He is solid but not great. Laurence Fishburne is also solid.\nOne thing that I definitely noticed in the film was the mood. The cinematography has a real gloomy look to it, which fits the film perfectly. The score of the film is also excellent. The script was written by Brian Helgeland, who was the man who wrote the brilliant script for LA Confidential. Theres no doubt he used alot of his talents to adapt the book but there is one significant flaw in the script. The conflicts that Penn and Robbins characters have our so well presented. But Bacon's is so undeveloped. I am not sure if thats a problem with the book or Helgeland's fault. But with this flaw, I could not give it a four-star rating. Some complain about the ending. However, I think its the perfect conclusion. A theme in Mystic River is loyalty and this is so well presented at the end of the movie. It also shows a sign of rejection. Clint Eastwood has crafted one of the years best. I dont know where Mystic River will end up this year on my top ten list because I still have alot to see. Although, I am pretty sure it will be there somewhere.",

Just cold, plodding, and unfulfilling, and it has a twist ending that is more than a little ridiculous.Jimmy, Dave, and Sean are 3 kids growing up in Boston and are close friends. Then one day, as they're playing in the street, Dave is abducted by two men posing as police officers and sexually abused for several days.The story then moves into present day, with Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, and Kevin Bacon playing the characters as adults. They all still live in the general area, but are no longer close friends, having grown apart over the years and going down different paths. Jimmy is a former hoodlum trying to put the past behind him. Dave is now a husband and father, but a hunched wreck of a man as a result of his childhood trauma. Sean is a cop with an estranged wife who keeps calling up (a useless subplot).After doing a good job setting up the characters and locale, the movie becomes a murder mystery when Jimmy's teenage daughter is found shot at bludgeoned to death.It's tough for me to be too hard on this movie, because the cast (which also includes Laurence Fishburne, Marcia Gay Harden, and for about 5 minutes, Laura Linney) is so terrific, and all of them give great performances, especially Robbins. The score is good, the cinematography is good, hell, even the TITLE sounds like it should be a great movie....but it's not.The most obvious flaw is that the story moves at about the speed of a glacier. I was very into it at first, but somewhere over the course of its 137 minutes, I went from paying close attention to the story to admiring the ceiling of the theater.Second, even though the actors do a great job of playing the characters, the whole thing still felt hollow to me. Apart from one scene where Penn breaks down on his porch, I didn't really FEEL anything for any of these characters (except maybe Robbins). It's a very cold, distant movie, which I totally didn't expect.Most damaging of all though is the climax. Without giving anything away, the explanation of how everything happened at the end is completely ridiculous, using coincidence to an extreme that is almost insulting. That's more a fault of the book it's based on than anything, but it's still a lame finish for a movie that seemed like it was saving all its energy for the climax.It's not one of the worst movies of the year or anything, but it's absolutely one of the most disappointing.",

This is not merely OK but downright reasonable behavior, and manly to boot. As what were you doing except avenging the death of your beloved daughter? Not only will this cause your wife to want to have passionate sex with you but you will also have supposedly law-abiding detectives turning blind eyes and deaf ears in just about every direction you can think of.Of course murder (and indeeed the sordid history of child abuse) usually has a long chain of cause and effect. In this particular case, the murder weapon was previously involved in a number of criminal activities in which our avenging superhero was also implicated. So we could say that he was in fact more responsible for the death of his own beloved daughter than was his childhood friend, and perhaps he should have taken the aforementioned weapon to himself and shot himself down like a dog.But then, we wouldn't have a superhero and hardly much of a story.

            "content": "In his somber psychological study 'Mystic River', Clint Eastwood delivers a true rarity - a work of high seriousness with a laid- back, un-emphatic touch. Years after one of them was abducted and abused - although we are not shown anything, the clear implication in these early moments is that a great and irrevocable horror is about to break out - three former friends find their lives entwined again uneasily by another crime, 25 years later. The crime here is the brutal, inexplicable murder of Jimmy's (Sean Penn) 19 year-old daughter. Arriving at the crime scene and realizing the full horror of what has occurred, he unleashes a pure animal howl. The only way he knows how to survive his sorrow is to seek revenge, and demands rough justice. The vicious homicide sends the community into turmoil, reuniting the three friends in a strange series of events \u2013 Sean (Kevin Bacon) is assigned to the case as the chief investigating officer, while Dave (Tim Robbins) emerges as a likely suspect. As the trio's unavoidable attachment deepens, the true repercussions of the childhood trauma begin to crystallize and haunt \u2013 Dave's psychological makeup eerily mirrors Jimmy's deepening mental disintegration, and Sean's forced to balance his past bonds with his current investigation.The sheer classical elegance of Eastwood's direction is a delight. He constantly finds new ways to keep the storyline moving without seeming too kitschy for a drama. The movie takes its time; the camera settles in and meditates on the characters, giving them space to reveal or conceal and in turn offers realism as a kind of grim poetry, even while managing to hook the most casual viewer right from the first frame.But it is the subtle portrayal of the three leading men which holds Mystic River together by adding psychological weight to the revenge- driven murder mystery. Penn delivers another multi-layered performance as a man in who rage, grief and honor suffer a head-on collision. Penn is so compellingly explosive that he outdoes even the best of his earlier work as a man who has uneasily made his peace with domesticity but still has a con's instincts. Robbins blends emotional exhaustion and uncertainty of direction to form a potpourri of despair that's really heartbreaking. He underplays beautifully, giving us a morose palooka who sounds dense one minute and then weaves muddled webs of metaphor, struggling to articulate his feelings. Bacon is as reliable as ever, playing the intelligent officer who holds emotions at an arm's length. It would be criminal to overlook the key female performances, particularly Marcia Gay Harden's heartbreaking turn as a woman caught between love and disgust.Methodical, riveting and emotionally charged; it's a story of lost innocence and a reminder that the past cannot easily be suppressed or forgotten. A tale of tragic misinterpretation, Mystic River ends with a certain amount of closure but still leaves behind an emptiness. A haunting and provocative psychological mystery!",

            "content": "**Warning! Mild Spoilers Ahead!**In \"Mystic River,\" director Clint Eastwood tells a complex story of three young boys whose lives are defined by a traumatic childhood event. Now in their thirties, the men's lives are again deeply intertwined by another traumatic and violent event, the mysterious physical, emotional, and psychological consequences of which are dramatically explored in this film.\nBut the mystery, although strong and completely enjoyable isn't the point as much as words and characters are. In contrast to many modern melodramas, the human drama here is formed using those words and characters, rather than music, editing, and cliche forlorn looks. And drama is the prime word to describe \"Mystic River,\" the best film of its kind since 2000's \"Traffic.\" Action and romance are side stories here, used as devices to drive the plot forward as it focuses on the characters and their words.\nThose Oscar-worthy words and characters spring from the taut script of Brian Helgeland (\"L.A. Confidential\"), who has brilliantly adapted Dennis Lehane's novel. The script never lapses into triteness, and the characters rarely say anything that seems out of place. This dialogue forms the foundation for a rock-solid movie that will not lose its greatness as time passes.\nThe actors build upon that foundation with a slew of terrific performances. The cast have received numerous accolades already, and I throw my hat onto the awards bandwagon as well. Sean Penn is being singled out for his excellent centerpiece work as the complicated Jimmy Markham, but the rest of the superb cast holds up against him with ease. Their professionalism and experience oozes through every scene of the film. Little things make the difference, like Marcia Gay Harden absent-mindedly closing an open cabinet on her way out of a room. Or Penn nearly pouring himself one last drink, then changing his mind. Or the subtle ways that Tim Robbins alters his character over the course of the film. All of these nuanced performances add up to the best dramatic ensemble in years, and I haven't even mentioned the underrated Kevin Bacon or the ever reliable Laurence Fishburne.\nIn his best directorial effort that I have seen (although I unfortunately haven't viewed \"Unforgiven\"), Clint Eastwood is remarkably efficient in delivering a classic drama in the vein of, dare I say, \"The Godfather.\" Like Coppola's masterpiece, \"Mystic River\" contains many of the great themes, such as family, vengance, and justice. These motifs carry the film, allowing audience connection in a world that is foreign to most viewers. It also presents a combination of moral questions and answers that only the best dramas have. These issues are what Eastwood uses to push his film to that next level of greatness. Technically speaking, the film is clean and simple, staying out of the way of itself and allowing the story to speak uninhibited. Editor Joel Cox (most of Eastwood's recent work) and cinematographer Tom Stern (\"Blood Work\") don't do anything fancy; no wild fades, zooms, or intricate editing techniques. In fact, the two are scarcely noticeable except for the commendable replication and placement of a couple key shots. Stern's background as a lighting technician is evident though, as he uses light and shadow wonderfully as he paints with a largely black and white palette. The music, largely composed by Eastwood himself (!), is also basic yet effective, providing primarily dramatic undertones, much like television's stellar \"Law & Order.\" In fact, with its direct pacing and progressive mystery, the entire film could be described as a 2+ hour version of \"Law & Order,\" done at a higher production level and featuring greater psychological and emotional depth. The only problems I see in this film are characters that are difficult to relate with and one story arc that seems truncated. As I mentioned, the characters involved are so flawed and different from many movie-goers that I can see some people having a difficult time relating. However, I personally can not relate to the story, yet was still captivated, which speaks to the true power of this film. And one story arc involving Bacon's character is not fully fleshed out; although this doesn't detract, it also does not involve at the same level. Bottom Line: This is a finely crafted film put together by a sublime mixture of technicians and actors.  Topped only by \"Return of the King\" in 2003, Mystic River has set a dramatic standard that will be used for years to come.  9/10.",

            "content": "Clint Eastwood directs this crime mystery about three men, and how they're forced apart and brought together again. It's a conventional plot; a murder mystery complete with cops, sunglasses and a red herring. Truth is, there's nothing too special about the plot. The first scene is great, setting the tone and mood as well as giving key information, and the end has bite (in a good way, but not necessarily happy way), but everything in the middle is run-of-the-mill.What isn't run of the mill is the acting. First things first, I've never like Sean Penn. I've never seen any of his movies, either. I just don't like him. Don't like his look. But he steals the show here. His anger, sadness, and especially his grieving seem absolutely genuine, and as a viewer it's gut-wrenching to watch him cry. I haven't seen many of the other nominees, but he deserves his nomination, if not the win.Tim Robbins, in one of his major roles not about Shawshank Prison, also performs well. He never cried, or showed much of anything in Shawshank. So it was a nice change to seem him play a shaken, emotionally distressed man. He's very good.Rounding out the Good,the Bad and the Ugly is Kevin Bacon as the icy cop. It seems I've only seen him in serious roles, like Frost/Nixon. I wasn't convinced with his phone relationship, and thought his reunion at the end was unnecessary. I understand why it was included though, to show that even cops have lives outside the job, as so few seem to do in film.Speaking of old Clint Eastwood films, the liquor store owner looks like a certain bandito, eh?I've read around the boards, and Mystic River is deeper than the plot. Much of the character's lives can be extrapolated, so you can make your own minds up about why they do what they do. This is a good film with terrific actors, but other than that it's not too special. 7.8/10",

            "review_title": "An excellent film....",
            "content": "Clint Eastwood indicates that he's much more than a clich\u00e9 Western actor in his direction of \"Mystic River\", through the immense skill he exuberates while weaving a poignant and emotional tale of personal redemption, greed, love and the brutal loss of innocence that so consistently plagues society.As usual, Eastwood's unique directorial ability lies within his insane ability to get the very best out of his performers (typified by the Oscar wins for both Sean Penn and Tim Robbins) and furthermore his simplicity. No emotional scene is over-done with dramatic choir music to effectively tell the audience how they should feel, and instead Eastwood indicates a respect for the audience in that he allows them, in every scene, to make up their own mind as to how they feel. Simple cinematography and simple editing allow Eastwood to merely SHOW us what's going on without relying on the basic clich\u00e9s of an intense drama that are so enthusiastically used and abused within modern day Hollywood.The acting, as alluded to in the previous paragraph, is absolutely top notch. Sean Penn is amazing as Jimmy Markum, a man with a hope of personal redemption but who internally struggles following the brutal death of his beloved daughter as he attempts to come to grips with his darker and more menacing side. Tim Robbins is excellent as the emotionally traumatised Dave Boyle, a man who is robbed of his youth following a tragic sexual molestation case. Indeed, Kevin Bacon shines in one of his simpler performances as Sean Devine - a man who works on the apparently \"good\" side of the law and has to struggle with his professional responsibilities as well as juggling the personal responsibility of an estranged relationship and an unknown child. All of these complex characters, with multi-dimensional sides, are portrayed excellently by the three main cast members and cement all three of them as some of the finer actors within modern Hollywood.Eastwood's direction possesses an emotional subtlety that is so rare within modern day Hollywood, and furthermore indicates a strong grasp of a complex medium - made all the more harder by the difficult task of bringing such an elusive novel to the firelight in a way that is both refreshing and new whilst simultaneously remaining true to the core and the heart of the initial concepts themselves.With satisfying editing and cinematography in conjunction with an excellent supporting cast including Laura Linney, Lawrence Fishburne, and Marcia Gay Harden, this film was ALMOST perfect were it not for such a dramatic alteration of directorial style in the final 15-20 minutes of an otherwise flawless picture. When the plot knuckles down to who actually was the perpetrator of the vicious crime, Eastwood seems to forget his responsibility to the audience and merely sit back without any input, overall resulting in a messy final 20 minutes and one that, not only confuses the audience, but only provides a limited resolution to a question that has been so brilliantly alluded to in the first two hours of the film. Clearly, a change of pace was intended and subsequently Eastwood needs to change his directorial style a little bit, however the final twenty minutes seems to merely be a jumble of scenes rather than a flowing text - the way that the first component of the film so brilliantly was.However, all things considered, this is a beautiful picture that will have you thinking about its major concepts for a long time to come. From its consistent questioning about love, friendship and loss, as well as a technical simplicity that Eastwood creates to allow more empathy and emotional input from the audience, this is a masterpiece above most others and full deserving of its various Oscar nominations and its two victories for the consistent Tim Robbins and the absolutely brilliant Sean Penn.A practically flawless picture.",

While reading it, I also realized that they would never be able to transfer this to the big screen intact. What we see in the film, although very faithful to the text, is just the surface of the story, and the characters.In order to get to know more about the relationship between the characters, as well as their motivation for the choices they make, the film would have to be twice as long and have a lot of voice over. The lack of the above makes a great book an OK film.As far as the film goes, it's pretty solid overall. The acting is good, but nothing fantastic. There are some exceptions, though. The unknown actors in the beginning of the film are just bad. It's like they just picked some people off the streets and gave them some lines to read. And then there's Tim Robbins. He has (probably) the toughest role to play, but he cannot pull it off. He's going for a subtle, almost underplayed performance, but somehow manages to overplay it instead, absolutely not Oscar material. The direction isn't bad, but it's not very exciting either. The film looks great, as they've really managed to give it the same kind of bleakness as in the book. Generally, it's good drama/ thriller with an extraordinary cast, that you wish you could have got more out of. I probably would have liked the film better if I hadn't read the book already.",

It was absurd that Sean Penn, or Tim Robbins received Oscars for their roles in this film! It defies explanation. Here are my beefs with this movie:1. Sean Penn did not go to the \"Less is More\" school of acting. That whole scene when they found his kid and him screaming \"Iz dat my dotta in theahhh?!\" over and over was totally and completely over the top! I've seen more subtle acting in Showgirls! Terribly over acted, it was embarrassing! (and the boston accents?? Yeah. They were pretty bad)2.It turns out that the daughter's boyfriend's little mute brother killed her. Huh? Wha? There simply was not enough background or enough time with this character in the movie. He's barely referred to at all, except at the very end and he's the one who killed her? I won't go into how he killed her, which was incredibly unbelievable as it was portrayed in the movie. I have not read the book, so I can't compare the book/movie, but it just made no sense. It was totally random that he was the killer!3. The whole scene with Sean Penn and Laura linney at the tail end was sickening and also totally unbelievable, and completely out of left field. For her to give that speech and then have sex with him as though it turned her on also seemed totally unwarranted. We never get to see the type of person she really is, she's apparently very close with her cousin celeste, so for her to make this speech seemed out of character, as she was portrayed in the film.4. Poorly written screenplay, lousy editing, badly directed (see critique of s. penn finding his daughter)5. The last scene, when they're all at the parade, and you see celeste searching for her husband, and Sean Penn and laura linney's characters carrying on like nothing happened wasn't believable at all6. The scene where Kevin Bacon and larry fishburn burst into the boyfriends apartment just as he's about to be shot?? come on!I could go on and on, but there were more holes in this movie than swiss cheese, and to see it be so critically acclaimed? I need backup on this. A very poor film, I don't recommend it!",

After years of not talking to each other, they have to find out who's responsible. If you are looking for a movie with a happy ending you should really look another way.

The ending in essence perfectly reflects the family culture surrounding crime descending from Irish heritage, with Jimmy admired by his wife, family and allies for his level handedness in the perception of injustice.The so called 'Mystic' river is thus the relentless scythe within the community, an extension of the will of Jimmy and his followers. Dave may have been innocent and mentally troubled, however his dissociation with the reality of crime, the seriousness of the complications surrounding his whereabouts on the night of the murder, ultimately lead to his demise in a way which whilst an unfortunate event would never be seen as a true tragedy within the close knit community.For those questioning the actions of Celeste (Dave's wife), for one she was clearly in shock at the events and her husband's erratic behaviour. She would also naturally confide in Jimmy who, as stated above, was seen as the leader and respected figure within the community, not withstanding the fact it is his daughter whom is involved. Drawing parallels to the Godfather and Connie's revelations to Michael regarding her own husbands betrayal of the family, so too does Celeste confide in Jimmy regardless of the likely ramifications to her own husband.For what it is worth I do see worth in the movie ending at the crossroads of Jimmy walking into the distance of the old road following his revelation to Sean, however I believe the additional run time provides a deeper insight into the psyche and logic behind thoughts and actions portrayed on scene.",

            "content": "Some people lock their bad memories deeply inside their minds so that they don't come across them again. They have erased truths to live without worries. They have closed the doors of their traumas and thrown them to the bottom of a river. But it is useless because sooner or later, something, no matter how small it may seem, will bring them to the surface and re-open those memories.In \"Mystic River\" based on the novel by Dennis Lehane and adapted by Brian Helgeland (LA Confidential), Clint Eastwood establishes the camera as the key to those secrets and the characters as the victims of its unlocking. The characters are three childhood friends. Jimmy (Sean Penn), Dave (Tim Robbins) and Sean (Kevin Bacon) whose relationship broke after the brief kidnapping of one of them - Dave. But now, 25 years later, their lives cross again after another horrible incident: the murder of Jimmy's daughter.Brendan (Thomas Guiry), a boy Jimmy does not approve of and wanted to run away with his daughter is a suspect. But so is Dave who came home the night of the murder covered in blood and was somewhat hysterical in the presence of his wife (Marcia Gay Harden). Sean, alongside Whitey (Laurence Fishburne) are assigned to the case. We remember that the three were once childhood friends shaken by that tragic event that lead to the decline of their friendship and now a similar things threatens to to so once again. Sean, returning to his childhood place, must face situations he never knew and emotions he pretends never existed.Jimmy vows to kill his daughter's assassin hiring some neighbourhood criminals to help him in the investigation. Then there is Whitey who thinks that Daqve is obviously guilty after all, everything seems to point in that direction. But Sean is unwilling to suspect a childhood friend.At the centre of \"Mystic River\" is the idea that many things that occur in the past do not always vanish with the passage of time. Every act has a big price that can pursue you for good. If the innocence and dreams from childhood are violently shaken the affected individuals may never be cured because traumas can be hidden inside victims even though they ignore it. But does everything count if it serves as a base to hide all the wounds? Every friend has to show his support and hope because in an atmosphere united with the similar sad objective, there is no room for doubts. But if one member (or friend) questions the honesty or truth of the others, probably the group of friends will be wounded to death (not literally).But \"Mystic River\" is not only a thriller about men dominated by their past or shaking their heads in disbelief due to their destinies. No, that is to simplistic. This is a character study of the highest order. A brutal analysis in the dissection of tragedy. A film about the importance of the devotion of wives. An emotional puzzle that goes along with the plot only to later throw away all the pieces. A study of innocence, guilt, revenge, paranoia and forgiveness. A film engulfed in incredible tension and sadness. In terms of its moral lesson, \"Mystic River\" is more cautious than \"Unforgiven\" and in terms of drama on par (or even above) with \"The Bridges of Madison County.\" I'm not sure where I would rank \"Mystic River\" amongst Eastwood's other masterpieces but I no for certain he has never united a better cast nor produced more powerful performances. Sean Penn is so intimately violent, angered yet undeniably touching. Tim Robbins transmits all the hopelessness and pain of Dave ad Kevin Bacon, in the best performance I can remember from him, attains the balance and coldness Sean needs to become the judge between his two friends (Dave and Sean). The female performances are also wonderful.The title \"Mystic River\" says it all. Although Mystic is a river that passes through Boston, the title is a metaphor of the film's emotional journey. Even though we arrive at a conclusion, the film is about the emotional journey we experience with the deeply fractured characters. With the simple yet commonly ignored idea that films should use real human emotions and take time to reveal the characters, Eastwood has created an elegant but disturbing notion of human nature that is fiercely ironic, filled with frustrations and regrets. When you leave the theatre feeling pain somewhere without knowing why and where don't worry, that is exactly the state you are meant to be in; a bit like the characters.",

Not even a con like Jimmy deserved the loss I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy ,your world just shatters and you stop functioning. We barely see Jimmy working after the death of Katie and that is acceptable as how could one expect Jimmy to be Business as Usual? It is only at the end that we see Jimmy \"functioning\" at the parade?Tim Robbins also plays a good red herring gray person, someone who doesn't consider himself to be human anymore after enduring sexual abuse. He is unemployed and his life with Celeste was disastrous as expected. Why? Because of his trauma. At some point I sympathized with the guy and at some point I felt slight disgust .But after the last scene in the movie I felt real pity for him. He could have confessed to the police about the molester and no one would bat an eye. He would have gone to jail but he would come a clean man like Jimmy did. His fate was essentially sealed due to the climax of Jimmy''s trauma and anger after losing his dearly beloved angel daughter.The end lesson is to get help for trauma as soon as possible.

All of this, plus Clint Eastwood, is enough to make the average viewer anticipate an exceptional cinematographic evening.Unfortunately, however, the film gets stuck trying to complicate itself and fool the viewer. Much like an Agatha Christie novel, it tries desperately hard to fool the audience in order to produce an extra thrill - and that lack of natural flow really marrs the film.This feels very much like Eastwood stretching his muscles, getting ready to be great. It is something that would be very good as a mock-up in need of some friendly, but brutal editing. As a nominee for Best Picture, it is just mystifying. Perhaps therein lies the beauty of the title.There is, however, some excellent acting by Tim Robbins who does a marvellous job portraying psychological damaged. Sean Penn has his moments of brilliance, but all in all nothing out of the ordinary.All of this said, it is worth giving a go for those who love crime thrillers. In my case, a crime thriller has to be truly brilliant to merit attention, but for those who naturally appreciate the genre and don't mind overlooking a few flaws, it is worth watching.",

            "content": "SPOILERSHaving slated murder mystery 'Gosford Park' in an earlier comment I am now about to lavishly praise what Clint and his crew have achieved with this one. Where 'Mystic River' is similar to 'Gosford Park' is that it is more than just a murder mystery film but it does not get to big-headed or distracted by what it is trying to do, as Altman's film does.I was instantly gripped by this, from the first frame to the last, and think that it is now about time Clint's directorial talents start to be mentioned ahead of his stereotyped acting roles. When directing is totally immersed in his characters, which is a breath of fresh air in these modern blockbuster times, but does not get too obsessed to allow the audience to lose focus on the plot. And this film has a seriously good plot.Although you always kind of knew the killer would not be Dave (Tim Robbins giving the insecure performance he has excelled with in the past, but this time with a psychotic edge) it was much harder to predict just who else it could have been. This is due to the wonderful subtlety of Clint's direction combined with a clever screenplay adaptation by Helgeland. In the thrilling parallel narrative climax you become so involved, as you urge Robbins to somehow convince Sean Penn's Jimmy that he did not do it, that when the gunshot hits home, and that flash of light explodes onto screen, it is literally like snapping suddenly out of a nightmare.The performances clearly warrant special praise. Penn was terrific, Robbins was almost as good, whilst Kevin Bacon and Laurence Fishburne, although with less challenging roles were still convincing in portraying their cop partner relationship. The actress who played Robbin's wife and the lad who played Brendan were also on a par with the big Hollywood players.I did not think there was much need for the final ten minutes. It should have finished with Penn walking away up that road, mirroring the opening act. The sub-plot of Kevin Bacon's wife not speaking on the phone was necessary to give him more personality as one of the three kids grown up, but was dealt with all wrong and lead to an overly sappy ending. However this is the only major flaw in Clint's near masterpiece.",

            "content": "**Spoilers** I am not really sure what to say about Mystic River.  All the elements were present to make a great movie, and yet somehow I felt very unsatisfied when all was said and done.  The acting was tremendous, and the direction seemed flawless.  The cinematography was eerily beautiful, and even the score was decent (seeing as it was written by Clint Eastwood himself).  However, in the end I was left with more questions then answers, and in a sense, felt cheated.  Perhaps it is my own fault.  I probably should have read the book before seeing the movie.  Then maybe I wouldn't have been scratching my head during that parade scene at the end.  The movie would have ended perfectly if it had concluded with Jimmy and Sean standing in the street, pondering the \"what ifs\" in life.  Instead it moved into this surreal parade scene that, I'm sure made sense in the book, but was confusing at best on screen. It seems that this scene was trying to convey certain thoughts and feelings without any words.  In a book this is easy to do because even though the characters aren't saying anything, we are told what they are thinking by the author.  In a theatre, on screen, conveying thoughts and feelings through gestures and facial expressions just doesn't cut it.  At least not in this situation.  I'm not sure if Sean, with his gun gesture, was saying to Jimmy \"Hey, way to go,\" or \"Hey, I'm gonna get you for murdering Dave.\"  Oh well. Mystic River is a decent movie.  I just wish the ending would have shed some light on everything that had come before it.",

            "content": "Contrary to the opinions of some other viewers, I found Mystic River an absolutely riveting film. The storytelling, the acting, the writing, and the cinematography were all superb, and the director and writer made excellent use of some of the finest actors working today.I avoided this movie in theaters because the subject matter seemed to be so heavy and serious: child abduction, molestation, murder, and revenge. But in fact, it is a movie with an ultimately hopeful and redemptive ending, and puts a human face on the kinds of people we are prone to pass every day without giving a second glance.As someone who moved to Boston in the late 1990s and experienced first-hand the rise of real estate costs and the slow process of gentrification, I find the characterization of the insular community of Charlestown, a working-class, white, Irish town just north of Boston, to be dead-on. Townies themselves may or may not agree with me, but I believe that ultimately the film is about survival and family cohesion within the sometimes hostile world of a big city.Sean Penn's acting in this movie was spot-on: he has the uncanny ability to evoke barely suppressed rage without actually spilling over into melodrama. Tim Roberts, as the grown version of Davy, who was abducted and raped as a young boy, does an admirable job evoking the kind of shell-shocked, medicated affect of a damaged soul who has never truly healed. Kevin Bacon and Laurence Fishburn also perform excellent roles, as does Marcia Gay Hardin as the wife of the grown Davy, who suspects that her husband may have committed a murder and doesn't know who to tell.",

            "content": "I have to say that this film doesn't quite work: for one thing, thescore enters in at all those high emotion moments to too high adegree.  The plot twists and turns don't quite make sense, with thefinal killer revealed seeming almost like a Scooby Doo ending. However, the real loss here for me is that the ending does not doDave's character justice.  So, he's been killed and put in the river. He's missing.  And the last thing we see is the river, almost likethat last shot in Psycho where the jeep is being pulled out of thepond.  However, this shot gives no indication of him being located,just \"washed away\" as is Jimmy's sin seemingly washed away byhis wife.  All he can do is throw up his hands when Bacon giveshim that hard stare.\n   This is a shame especially because the only character that reallyhits you is Robbins, besides Fishburne as Sean's partner Whitey. Robbins, as partnered with a wonderfully alive Marcia Gay Harden,is cynical, hopeful, scared, frightening, nurturing, delusional, funny,cunning, smart: in short, he is human and multi-dimensional. Sean Penn doesn't seem to be able to find all the angles onJimmy Markham.\n    So, in the end, if this goes up for anything, I would hope it winsRobbins a Best Supporting Actor Oscar.  Besides that, I wouldn'taward it a thing: yes, it is all about acting and drama and plot. However, just because you're making an \"adult\" film as opposedto a kid's movie, you still have to show skill.  FInding Nemo wasbetter plotted and executed than this, Clint.

Eastwood makes these characters come to life, through mainly brilliant acting by all the key stars.

And I'm getting allergic to closeups with slow zooms, here designed to let Penn show his chops. (The whole dialogue on the porch with Robbins and Penn could have played better as a two-shot.) One can feel Eastwood trying to stay away from the most blatant sentimentality, but he doesn't take it all the way, in my opinion. This is still too much \"Hollywood\" for it to have effect on me.

            "content": "My Fianc\u00e9 and I like to watch LAW AND ORDER on TV.  She spends the whole episode trying to figure it out the mystery.  I watch the opening moments, meet all the characters, and think about it for a moment and of course I call the outcome 90% of the time.  It doesn't mean that I don't enjoy sitting through a good mystery.  It's just after a while it becomes more difficult for me not to figure out what happens in the end.That's the problem I had with Clint Eastwood's (Blood Work) new film MYSTIC RIVER. It's a riveting and tense thriller, it's one of the best films of year and of course I went and ruined it for myself by figuring out the outcome about an hour before the movie ended.  Was it the `Old Economy of Characters' that made it so easy? Not really!  I think it's just the film has one logical ending and if you miss the clues you'll kick yourself in the head.The story follows three friends in South Boston.  They are Jimmy (Sean Penn, I Am Sam), Dave (Tim Robbins, Bob Roberts), and Sean (Kevin Bacon, Wild Things).  As kids, Dave was kidnapped and raped by some guys dressed liked cops, they kept him in a dirty cellar for four years until he escaped. He got home but he never quite recovered.  Jimmy grew up to be a petty thief, served two years in prison, and is now a legitimate shopkeeper is his neighborhood, and Sean is now a detective with a marriage that's almost non-existent.  These three friends are forced to come to grips with their friendship when Jimmy's daughter (Emmy Rossum, Songcatcher) winds up murdered.  MYSTIC RIVER is about the sins of our past, mistaken identities, and those small moments that change our lives forever.  It's about what ties us all together, how we face our demons, and the bonds of friendship and family. It's also about flawed people forced to face the demons.  It's probably the best-acted film I've seen all year.Sean Penn gives the performance of a lifetime.  I finally forgive him for the travesty that was I AM SAM and I'm hoping that he moves on as well. There is a powerful moment, as he must tell his wife (Laura Linney, The Life of David Gale) that his daughter (From a first marriage) is dead.  The two of them look at each other for a moment and then embrace.  This kind of scene is very rarely powerful, in most films it's almost laughable, but all I could think was `Wow!'  For once it wasn't mucked up.  For once a director allowed raw power to move a scene and not harsh swelling music.Clint Eastwood has proved once again that with the right material he can direct a film that is smart and well told.  He has a very shaky track record, for every UNFORGIVEN, there are messes like TRUE CRIME and BLOOD WORK.  MYSTIC RIVER is better than UNFORGIVEN, but these two films will be considered classics.I liked MYSTIC RIVER.  I liked how it unfolded.  I just wish I could have shut my brain down because I hate it when I call the end of a good mystery. It reminded me of the moment when I called the end of THE OTHERS.  Of course I loved the film, but I felt cheated by my own cleverness.  I sometimes wish I could enjoy a movie like the masses.  But since I can't,  I will sing MYSTIC RIVER'S praises, and beseech the Academy to nominate Penn for this performance, he deserves it.So, If you're looking for a taught thriller with lots of mystery give MYSTIC RIVER a chance.  It's well worth two hours of your time.****1/2  (out of 5)",

            "content": "Eastwood directs an all star cast including Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, Kevin Bacon, Marcia Gay Harden, Laurence Fishburne and Laura Linney in 'Mystic River.' The film is an adaptation of the novel of the same name by bestselling author Dennis Lehane. It is a crime-drama set on the back-drop of Boston where three kids witness something horrible committed against one of the kids that will grow up to be Tim Robbins. The other two will grow up to be Sean Penn, our protagonist in the thinnest sense of the word, and Kevin Bacon. They all now live separate lives but when the murder of Penn's daughter brings them together once more their lives are shattered as pieces of evidence are brought together. Penn is sent into a violent rage and conducts his own investigations whilst Bacon, now a cop tries to conduct the investigation by the book and Robbins begins to drown himself in his own misery. There is a lot to admire about the film but there is also a lot I disliked. I admired the cinematography and the Boston setting was perfect. The actors worked well together and as a mystery it kept me guessing until the very end of the film. I liked the cinematography and the tension that is built in many scenes but the film as a whole never reached its potential for me. I see the relevance of the crime committed against the younger Tim Robbins but that part of the story never comes full circle in a way for the story to be complete. Many of the characters are not likable and a sub-plot involving Bacon and his wife feels forced and unnecessary almost like Eastwood was trying to give the audience some emotional pay off. Marcia Gay Harden and Tim Robbins who are the two best things about the movie act their hearts off to bring empathy and sympathy to their two characters and when the film does come to a close we find that our two beloved characters end up the worst off and while I don't mind that with a lot of movies this made me frustrated. Bacon is average and Penn creates a complex and deep character but the film really gives him one truly dramatic scene to work with whilst the others work but aren't entirely emotionally satisfying. Based on his sole performance I don't think it should have won the Oscar but judging on the two performances that year, (he also worked in 21 Grams) I do think he was deserving of the award. And sadly Fishburne and Linney aren't given much to do in the film. All of these elements could have worked if it wasn't for the usually brilliant direction of Clint Eastwood. Hear he directs with an uncomfortable clunkiness and the story has no flow which comes so easily in his other films. There are certainly better crime dramas out there and better Clint Eastwood films as well.",

At the end, we see the two couples, happy, with their children, happy...

But what took me most out of the film was the damned product placement for Jello Fat-Free pudding, which some idiot set designer stuck in a pantry. Beyond the fact that the camera seemed to focus more on the pudding than on the characters, the damned stuff needs to be refrigerated! No wonder Sean Penn's character  was acting so bizarre. He was probably suffering from salmonella poisoning from eating bad pudding!  Jello is owned by Kraft Foods, which, in turn is owned by Altria, the new tidied over corporate name for Philip Morris.

            "content": "Clint Eastwood's 2003 who did it-thriller won Best Actor in a Leading Role and Best Supporting Actor at the Oscars and was nominated for all the other categories in addition to Best Picture. As you can already see from the wins for the actors, the great strength of this film lies in its performances. But with Eastwood's great direction and its electrifying suspense, the film brings many other great elements to the table. Mystic River tells the story of three childhood friends who drifted apart after an incident. Decades later, none of the three have left their hometown and a tragic event occurs. This brings the friends and their loved ones back together in very different roles.Sean Penn won his first major Oscar for his embodiment of a family man with a criminal past who is out for revenge after a violent stroke of fate. In the course of this, the demons of the initially quite normal small-town resident crystallise, giving his character entirely new facets. This transformation is perfectly realised by Penn. What can be classified as passive-aggressive for the most part develops into escalation, especially towards the end. Tim Robbins, who won for Best Supporting Actor, is every bit as good as Penn with his performance, albeit in a very different way. His character, scarred by a terrible incident in his childhood, is clearly calmer, more subtle and, above all, more sensitive. Robbins brilliantly calls on all these traits, which also makes every interaction between him and Penn's character very interesting and explosive. In addition to the film's two stand outs, Kevin Bacon, Marcia Gay Harden and Laura Linney deliver strong performances.Although Mystic River seems like a standard murder-mystery at first impression, Eastwood manages to stage the actually banal plot fantastically with his flair for the appropriate cast, beautiful shots and an inimitable build-up of tension. You can hardly look away until the end, the resolution is unpredictable and the behaviour and communication of the characters captivate you. The only shortcoming is the ending. It seems abrupt and unsatisfactory after all the explosiveness. This film is not one for a happy ending, but Mystic River definitely deserved a more fitting finale.",

Tim Robbins is one of the highest on my American heroes list, but I just don't get this one. And Larry Fishburne... what can I say, he's the man.

            "content": "MILD SPOILER ALERT MIDWAY THROUGH REVIEWAnyone walking into a movie theater enters with certain expectations about the film he or she is about to see, and hopes that those expectations will be met or exceeded.  How many times, however, have you had not only had the expectations you walked in with met or exceeded, but were also astonished that the filmmaker met or exceeded expectations you didn't even realize you had?  Clint Eastwood, Brian Helgeland, and the cast and crew of \"Mystic River\" somehow managed to exceed such expectations for me.Specifically, I walked into the film expecting to see a powerful human story of grief, loss, and the conflicting needs for revenge and more humane closure -- and in this expectation, Eastwood and company succeeded gloriously.  Many critics have noted the epic nature of the film, and Helgeland's script (as realized by Eastwood's direction and the performances) subtly incorporates elements of Shakespearean tragedies. Indeed, two of the most chilling scenes of the film -- Sean Penn's confrontation with Tim Robbins in the desolate bar, and Laura Linney's bedroom scene with Penn -- are eerily reminiscent of the last two acts of \"Hamlet\" and Lady Macbeth's scenes respectively.  Rarely do you see a film that truly achieves epic status on the intimate scale presented here, as opposed to the typical epic on the panoramic scale we're used to (i.e., \"Ben-Hur\", \"The Lord of the Rings\" series, \"Lawrence of Arabia\").Where the movie aroused different expectations for me was just how intense and well-structured the actual mystery is.  Much of this no doubt derives from Dennis Lehane's novel (which, admittedly, I have not read), but Helgeland's script and Eastwood's directing choices keep the viewer guessing as to whether the Tim Robbins character is guilty of the murder of Penn's daughter, or whether someone else is responsible.  Moreover, none of these alternative explanations comes across as contrived or illogical. -- MILD SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!!Indeed, the final explanation of the crime not only strikes the viewer as utterly believable, but highlights the tragedy by pointing up the futility of a character's revenge.-- END SPOILER --- Throughout the film, the performances are exceptional.  Penn is brilliant as a man with a criminal past (who has not put that past too far behind him) forced to confront the brutal murder of his daughter; the scenes where (1) he finally breaks down after his daughter's wake, and (2) he vows vengence over his daughter's body are primers in the art of realistic, restrained acting.  Robbins is equally fine as his emotionally brutalized childhood friend, who may or may not be guilty of the killing.  Kevin Bacon gives a wonderfully understated, yet pained performance as the third friend of the trio, now investigating the murder and trying to maintain his perspective. The women are equally powerful -- Marcia Gay Harden as Robbins' loving, but terrified wife, and Linney as Penn's second wife, who has a leg up if anyone in Boston is casting for Lady Macbeth.The cinematography and editing also highlight the film's mood, establishing the claustrophobic and gritty feel of the East Boston neighborhood where the action takes place.  Watching the film, you get the illusory feeling that such a neighborhood is a wonderfully snug, safe place to grow up as a child (an assumption disproved by events in the film), but that it is almost like a cage to the adults living there.  Likewise, Eastwood's flashbacks to Robbins' horrifying childhood experiences serve well to disorient the viewer and bring him/her into Robbins' mindset.  Eastwood's musical score (yes, you read that correctly) is equally up to the task of mirroring its characters' lives -- outwardly simple, yet somehow still haunted.Put simply, \"Mystic River\" is one of the best films in a year that has been highlighted by outstanding films.",

            "content": "An absolute gem of a psycho-dynamic study of crime and punishment in an economically marginalized neighborhood in Boston. Although the story primarily revolves around a single grisly murder of a young female, so many tangential elements surround the case that mere cursory examinations of the so-called obvious leads will not suffice. Mr. Eastwood & co. render a deeply rooted thrust into not only the crime itself, but also into the lives and histories of so many of the characters. Rather than \"shout-out\" names, the entire cast shone in this urban tour-de-force, not just the usual headliners. As good as Sean Penn fulfills his thespian requirements, I'll take Tim Robbins' character's portrayal over Sean Penn's in this one. Granted, Sean Penn always makes a good run for his money in any film, but his role, character development and persona here is much like the same Sean Penn you see in other films, e.g., \"State of Grace\", which is not a knock on him in any sense of the word.Tim Robbins, however, is cast in a more abstract and complex role, with all sorts of psychological skeletons lurking about. His character is not of his usual fare and his minimalistic, aloof and introverted approach seems to help him explore the depths of his character. This approach enables him to pave the way for an eventual outpouring of pent-up emotion, made more evident as the movie approaches its conclusion. Also, he seems ever so much at home with his role as the regular guy, in a working class, mid-life Boston-Irish motif. No doubt, brother Eastwood had a hand in this developmental approach as well. Lastly, Laura Linney, as Penn's screen wife, shines, even in her somewhat limited time allotment. Her little \"absolvo te\" soliloquy towards the film's conclusion could be, in fact, the dramatic highlight of the film.",

This is where the movie seems unrealistic to me, when it ceases to ever break the constant tension.I also didn't buy some of the character portraits, like Kevin Bacon's rocky marriage or Tim Robbins' tumultuous past. Some of these things were a little TOO convenient for the sake of the plot advancement. In other words, I could break apart the mechanics of the plot and see where it was pieced together. The performances are all very good. I guess it's nice to see Kevin Bacon in a major role again and Tim Robbins and Sean Penn are surprisingly capable here. It's funny because the way people are socially interwoven across generations in this movie reminded me of that crappy movie Sleepers (also with Kevin Bacon).This is a solid film, but it doesn't blow your mind or anything. A few jokes to replace the smart-alecky cop dialog every now and then wouldn't hurt. Incidentally, while it is interesting in theory, I was unimpressed by Clint Eastwood's efforts at musical scoring. The soundtrack lacked any real punch.A good effort, but Clint's recent films have not affected me very much because they're so serious and grim. They seem almost unrealistic.7.5",

So I've had Mystic River on my shelf for a few weeks before I got into one of those moods. The reason I got it was because of all the acclaim...so I thought it would be a good flick to watch on a stormy night. I am not going to pretend to know all the symbolisms or story telling devices or just the plain psycho-babble that so many people point out on these comments...(you know, the ones who opened a dictionary and looked up the most sophisticated words they could find to feel educated) or those that say you have be be an \"intellectual\" to understand and enjoy this movie which is absolutely arrogant. But anyway, like i said, from a viewpoint of an average guy I felt this movie was very good. Easily something to recommend to a friend or family member. A good murder drama that has twists and suspicion to go around. Sure there are going to be some things that you are going to question, disbelieve or even feel obvious but I think no matter what the case, it keeps you hanging out to find out the conclusion with mild suspense. The acting is good all around, especially Robbins, which I laughed to myself because I thought he had a speech impediment in the beginning but realized..oh wait..thats not his speech..that's just Boston! The story is very familiar (Sleepers), but it still kept me interested with all the dot-connecting that unravels. The only complaint I would give is the ending which was, in my opinion, discouraging but hey sometimes that what makes people talk about after it is done so it was no biggie. Over all, it is a good popcorn and soda movie at night to just enjoy and maybe think about afterwards, but since i am just an action/sci-fi buff, I just the leave the thinking and analyzing at work and the entertainment and fun to the movie.... 7 out of 10!",

            "content": "Mystic RiverMystic River is a psychological thriller that looks at a murder case from the points of view of three main characters: Sean (Kevin Bacon) a cop, trying to solve the case, Jimmy (Sean Penn), the father of the victim, and Dave (Tim Robins), an old friend of the two who might be hiding something about the murder. The movie begins by showing us those three characters when they were kids playing street hockey on the street, followed by an event that will change Dave's life forever. It is due to the distress this event has brought upon on Dave's character that will later draw suspicions on him about the murder. When we are brought back to present time, we see that Jimmy is running a grocery store and has a daughter; Dave is also married and has a kid. After the murder, we are introduced to present-time Sean, who is the investigator on the case. Mystic River succeeds in keeping the audience guessing until the end while questioning the concepts of prejudice, justice and karma. Jimmy's insistence on taking the matters into his own hands to punish the killer reveals his aggressive side which, combined with his obstinate prejudice and criminal tendency, makes us gradually lose our sympathy for him despite the tragedy. Jimmy's first suspect is her daughter's secret boyfriend, son of Just Ray, with whom Jimmy had a feud with in his criminal past. But our attention quickly turns to Dave as his alleged story about the confrontation with the mugger at the night of the murder looks less credible due to his deeply troubled and disturbed character. Instead of feeling sorry for Jimmy, who lost his daughter, we find ourselves feeling sorry for Dave who might have something to do with the murder. \nThe first thing that stands out about `Mystic River' is the Oscar-caliber performances of Sean Penn and Tim Robbins. Performances of Marcia Gay Harden, Laurence Fishburne and Laura Linney are also worth mentioning. Second thing that caught my attention was that it rightly gives you the feeling that is adapted from a powerful book. Clint Eastwood does a good job of directing but it is not his directing that makes the movie work. It is the performances of the actors and the strength of the book the movie is based on that makes it work. Having said that, I also must say that there are some parts of the movie which, in my opinion, do not work as well as they are intended to. The phone calls from Sean's wife fail to rouse any feeling, probably due to the fact that we are not familiar enough with both characters or the nature of their dispute. It might have been better if the introduction (act 1) of the movie were stretched just a little longer to give us some familiarity with all of the characters. Instead, most attention is given to the act 2, the investigation. However, what bothered me the most was the Sean's reaction to the revelation by Jimmy in the end because it appeared to be in conflict with the portrayal of his character. I guess the signals were there during the interrogation scenes, where Sean played the `good cop' for his friend Dave, but the bad cop for the boyfriend, that Sean was moved by his emotions. Otherwise, there would be no reason for him to not carry out his duties like a rational police officer.",

The utterly compelling story unfolds at a measured pace, from its unexpectedly terrifying prologue right up until the carefully-constructed ending.The film's success lies in its effortless exploration of the weighty themes including repressed childhood trauma and family grief. The three disparate leads allow it to become not only a gripping police detective drama, but also a delicate drama about a PTSD sufferer attempting to move on with his family, as well as the lengths a grieving father will go to (which surely influenced Vileneuve's masterful 2013 work 'Prisoners').With a vivid cast of townsfolk, a plot that will keep you guessing until the end, and enough drama for at least two films, 'Mystic River' is without a doubt worth watching. Following a fabulous climax, it does admittedly stumble a little in its denouement (especially with a questionable and out-of-character monologue from Linney's character), but overall this Greek-tragedy-esque drama is one of 2003's best films.88/100",

            "content": "Clint Eastwood, made famous by his portrayal of inspector 'Dirty' Harry Callahan, has directed over 20 movies so far, including films such as The Rookie, Unforgiven and Million Dollar Baby, but I think Mystic River is by far his best work so far. Sean Penn and Tim Robbins both won Oscars for their roles in this drama that is sure to surprise every viewer.Mystic River is one of those few movies that is focused on triggering emotions and giving insights into what human beings are really capable of. The plot itself is focused around three former childhood friends, Jimmy, Sean and Dave, who are reunited under less than pleasant circumstances when Jimmy's daughter ends up murdered. The murder is investigated by Sean and his partner Whitey. Dave becomes the main suspect when he comes home to his wife covered in blood, confessing that he fought and possibly killed someone who tried to mug him. As you can imagine, no one believes him, even his own wife. It's not everyday in a small town that two people get killed on the same day, and the families involved happen to know each other.This conflict is paralleled by a horrible event that happened in their past. When they were just kids, they were approached by two men pretending to be cops, and they took Dave and molested him for two whole days. The story hints that similar to the way vampires create other vampires, getting molested often causes urges to molest as well.This movie is more about what happens between the three childhood friends than the solution of the conflict. Although it is eventually solved, in a way, there is no real closure because we are uncertain as to what happens after the killer is found. Jimmy is angry, and clearly states that he will kill whoever did this to his daughter, and it is obvious that he means it considering that he is an ex-con. Sean doesn't believe that his friend Dave is capable of doing this and is constantly arguing with his partner, Whitey, who thinks it is obvious that Dave is the killer. Viewers can tell from the beginning that Dave is still not over what happened to him in his childhood, and probably never will be.Eastwood as a director is famous for using shadows and darkness to evoke emotions or to point suspicions on certain characters. When Dave comes home to his wife, the light is cast on him in such a manner that you are led to believe that he is surely the killer. This movie also uses a lot of downward angles on things like the river and people like Dave to put a sense of uncertainty and depth in these things and people.It is rare to find as good of acting as is present in this film. Everyone who gets a chance to should definitely watch this film. It is always an experience to watch something that can actually make us feel, instead of just entertaining us. This is one of my favorite movies of all time, and I have to honestly give it a 10.",

            "content": "Having read Dennis Lehane's strong crime book a few years ago, I knew that a very powerful and even upsetting film could be made from it. But Eastwood's coarse direction flattens out the story's effect and allows for some wildly uneven acting.  You should come out of this film disturbed, but that certainly didn't happen for me.Spoilers ahead.There's enough punch in the material for the film to be effective as a detective thriller, and it's best in those scenes and the first scenes with Sean Penn's character Jimmy dealing with his daughter's murder.\nBut the book is also very good at evoking a sense of the insular lower middle class South Boston Irish Catholic community and the various personalities in it.The film manages to do this to some degree, but some of the most interesting characters are given short shrift, particularly Annabeth (Laura Linney) who is Jimmy's wife. In the book, she winds up being far more frightening a character than her husband, but Linney is barely in the film until the end where she has one Lady Macbeth-ish scene that comes out of nowhere. Linney also lacks a certain street-wise coarseness (as opposed to vulgarity) that the character needs.Also, the film is not successful in making a clear connection between the abduction of Tim Robbins' character as a boy by two pedophiles and the present day occurrences. If you know the book, that's a tough job, but not impossible. There's some commentary about it by Penn and Bacon, but it's not enough.The acting a very mixed bag - Eastwood has always tended to leave actors to their own devices, for better or worse.Penn has some excellent scenes (his post-funeral scene on the porch with Tim Robbins is a beauty), but also some where he starts teetering into Al Pacino land (and not early good Pacino). Bacon is good, but his jaw is permanently clenched in one position. The scenes with him and his estranged wife on the phone could be cut - they add nothing and come off as clumsy.Tim Robbins has two good scenes, but the rest of the time his acting is largely two-note and so mopey that his character comes off like a half-wit (which is not what he's supposed to be at all, based on the novel). He looks so miserable that there's nothing at stake for this character when the walls close in around him.  He's marked as DOOMED and his unjust fate just seems inevitable rather than the moral outrage it should be.Just as bad is Marcia Gay Harden who gives an annoying one-note lip-quivering, face-squinched performance throughout.I did like Laurence Fishburne in a rather thankless role - he was the most relaxed onscreen of any of the stars (he has one good scene where he stand up to Penn). Some of the minor players (the murdered daughter's BF and his slatternly mother in particular) do fine work.If you haven't read the book, the film is a reasonable if uneven entertainment, but it's not quite the tragedy it should be.  The reviews so far have been excellent, which is surprising.I think the critics are going all out for Eastwood as they think this will be his last real hurrah. And it's certainly better than his last 3-4 films, but that's largely due to the quality of the original material.Looking at \"Mystic\" screenwriter Brian Helgeland's work post \"L.A. Confidential\" (\"The Postman,\" \"Conspiracy Theory,\" \"Blood Work,\" \"A Knight's Tale,\" \"The Order\"), I'm convinced that the excellent quality of \"Confidential\" is chiefly the result of the efforts of director and co-writer Curtis Hanson.In fact, Hanson would have been a far better choice to direct \"Mystic\" than Eastwood (the mediocre \"8 Mile\" notwithstanding).",

Then it adds a sympathetic mix and makes you feel sorry for Jimmy Markum (Penn), and many of the other characters. About halfway through the movie, you end up predicting who Katie Markum's (Jimmy's daughter) killer is, but then you change your mind. It's that way through the whole film and the killer ended up to be the one you least expected. Those kind of 'least-expected' films are my favorite! Keep 'em coming Hollywood!

            "content": "With Academy Awards for Sean Penn and Tim Robbins for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor, there can be little doubt about the high quality of performances by the cast of \"Mystic River\".  With Clint Eastwood as the Director, attracting a cast of all-stars, which also included Kevin Bacon and Samuel L. Jackson, the mechanics and technical aspects of the film itself are all first class, the weakness, however- and it is a significant weakness- comes in the plot and storyline, neither of which meets up with the high levels of this undertaking. Most people reading this already know the details of the story, and so I will not repeat them here.  I will say that \"Mystic River\" reminded me very much of a Clint Eastwood movie from 1978 called \"Tightrope\" in which he played a Police Detective in New Orleans on the trail of a serial killer. Circumstantial evidence is built up through the film pointing to the distinct possibility that the Eastwood character himself may be the actual murderer, making for some intriguing possibilities. {Possible Spoiler Ahead} At the end of the movie, however, when the killer is revealed, the audience feels cheated as the murdered turns out to be some random minor character barely mentioned in the story, with a lame motive for his actions sloppily tacked on.  Hmmmmmmm.  Ironically, Kevin Bacon appeared in the 1996 film \"Sleepers\" which dealt with grown men attempting to come to terms with sexual molestation endured while in juvenile detention in the early 70's, and also played a character named Sean.  Hmmmmmmm. \"Mystic River\" touches on the three boyhood friends, and the tragic circumstances which ostensibly led to the dissolution of their friendship, but the movie is not about Tim Robbin's character's struggle to come to terms with his horrific experience.  At least, most of it isn't.  It actually cannot seem to decide what it is. A lot of the movie is a standard TV police show investigation, except that Bacon and his partner Jackson don't bother to compare the DNA of the potentially incriminating blood stains found in a suspect's car, with that of Sean Penn's murdered daughter. That might have cleared some questions up pretty quickly. (Doesn't Clint ever watch CSI?  Forensic technology has changed quite a bit from Dirty Harry's days in San Francisco in 1968, though you'd never know it from this movie). Penn was quite good as the neighborhood tough still in the crime game, though he seemed to be channeling Robert DiNero at times.  Bacon played his standard take on the police investigator, and Jackson's African-American character must have been named \"Whitey Powers\" as some type of joke. Robbins deserved his Oscar for the performance of the tortured soul, but the cheap ending, complete with Bacon giving the hand pistol shooting sign to Penn (a la Charles Bronson at the end of \"Death Wish\") and the glaring unfinished business and looses ends finds one watching the final credits roll with a \"Hmmmmm\".",

Acting is secondary, if you ask me. A good movie will be helped by good acting, and most good movies are still pretty good even with bad acting.

All the characters acted in the way they were supposed to at all times. And it looked like real life, in every way. Every pretense flowed into the next and was thought-provoking and rich with meaning. Yet it did not tell you what to feel. The clues and motives naturally allowed your mind to fill it in. This movie was simple yet never seemed to think the audience a dummy. Yeah, and the acting was good. All the top stars turned in great performances.Clint Eastwood did a marvelous job too. This movie could have been screwed up. This movie could have just been some B movie flop, even with the grade A talent. It seemed to me that Eastwood could have directed my ninth graders into a fine movie with this one. So this is a case where good acting helped an already good movie.As I sit here staring at the screen, I want to say more about it. But I can't. I honestly see now why I didn't know what the movie was about: no one wanted to spoil it for me.

            "review_title": "Eastwood's Imperfect But Powerful Tragedy",
            "content": "\"Mystic River\" is a film of vaulting ambition and director Clint Eastwood's brave attempt to make a great American Tragedy in a style not unlike Theodore Dreiser's fateful novels or Italian director Luchino Visconti's calamitous domestic dramas. That he partially succeeds is due in great part to a magnificent ensemble cast, a methodical, old fashioned deliberateness in the storytelling and a haunting music score (composed by Eastwood) that reverberates throughout the film like a memento of past sins and regrets.Unfortunately  \"Mystic River\" falls far short  of greatness. Brian Helgeland's screenplay, based on Denis Lehane's compulsively readable crime novel, preserves the fascinating domestic drama but also retains much of the pedestrian dialogue that made the book little more than pulp fiction of a very average sort. The story of three boyhood friends whose lives are forever intertwined by a traumatic childhood incident  becomes a seemingly endless maze where the history of two working class Boston families are enmeshed in crimes of the past that echo into the present and inevitably  the future. The great American playwright Eugene O'Neill was a master at dramatizing a particular family drama wherein  his characters wore the past like a millstone around their necks. Clint Eastwood does the same thing here on an almost grander scale.Where the movie trumps -up is in the trite exchange between characters, particularly in scenes involving a murder investigation and conversations between a distraught husband and wife. The faults of the novel are repeated  to some degree in the film.That being said, there is much to admire here. The performances by Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, Marcia Gay Harden and Laura Linney are brilliant .  Kevin Bacon  does an admirable job with a rather hamstrung role as a cop assigned to a murder case. His scenes with Laurence Fishburne (another superb performance) are well acted but  undermined by  \"Dragnet\"-like dialogue that clashes with the more sobering domestic drama. Eastwood's deliberate pacing pays off at the finale. Much of the film is shot under gray skies and dimly lit nighttime scenes. A  patriotic parade under a bright noonday sun seems like a strange coda to end this film, until the camera pans across the murky Mystic River at  dusk , when all the power of this earnest but imperfect movie seems earned.",

Mystic River started off being that kind of movie.  There's a tragic flashback, and a leisurely look at a fairly typical Saturday in the present day in an urban area near Boston (unclear where - probably Charlestown based on its proximity to the city). Suddenly, Saturday becomes Sunday and the day is in no way typical.  Senn Penn does a great job at playing the grief-stricken father.However...Kevin Conway has a great (and uncredited!) bit part as Annabeth's father, appears briefly in one (or maybe two scenes) then disappears off the face of the earth.One character pretty much arranges to have another character killed.One character (a person without much money) has managed to anonymously pay someone $500 a month for about 12 years.  How does that work exactly?The dark lighting effects are sometimes handled brilliantly (when Dave is telling his son about the boy running away from the wolves) and sometimes render the actors invisible.Another character shows a steely spine after being something of a mess for most of the movie.The ending is just so scattered you wonder how it happened, after the movie starting off so promisingly.I don't hate this movie.  I'm glad I went.  I don't know if it's just very faithful to a muddled book or what.  But it's almost as if a different director and writer did the second half of the movie.",

Some devices are figurative (the distant wife over the cell phone, the symbolism of which I really liked), others are literal.Robbins' Dave is just phenomenal. Anyone who has ever been abused (or knows someone who has been) will see their own thoughts rippling through this performance. He's quite clearly still the victim...never having fully grown (as the characters say toward the end) past the events he suffered at the age of 11. The context itself is the villain.And really, it's a film without villains or heroes. It's a movie about real people. And it has a cluster of some of the most remarkable, quiet, intelligent performances ever put to film, all riding above a fine script, and woven around an amazing directing feat.I love this movie and recommend it unreservedly, for those who can appreciate the flawed, striving human in all of us.For those of you who snipe at \"American films\", I do hope you'll include \"Mystic River\" in your assessments of what that phrase entails.

It portrays women (i.e. - Marcia Gay Harden) as being helpless, confused and willing to go along with whatever their husbands say. True, maybe her character was frightened, but if she thought he wasn't the murderer, why did she play dumb with the police?And what was with Sean Penn's wife telling him it was OK to be a murderer at the very end? She was nobody during the movie, then all of a sudden her character appears at the end! She doesn't care about him wasting one of his childhood friends? Obviously, she goes along with whatever he does. Maybe this is true to life (murderers' girlfriends think they can do no wrong), but why does Hollywood perpetuate the \"helpless woman\" stereotype?? Are there no women offended by this movie???My other problem with this movie: the whole thing about the police thinking Dave was the murderer. Get real -- this is the 21st Century and we have DNA evidence! Any policeman/prosecutor worth his salt would have run DNA tests on the blood found in Dave's car to see if it matched the blood of the murdered girl! It was too unbelievable that the police would not bother to do this. Apparently, they only ran a blood type. I think this makes a hole in the plot of this movie as big as the Grand Canyon. WAY too unbelievable.Also unbelievable was that Kevin Bacon's character would not bother to find out what happened to Dave, particularly when Sean Penn, in so many words, confessed to Dave's murder. (He said, \"You were too late finding the murderer.\") DUH. What was that all about? Were we supposed to feel bad for Sean Penn's character because he brutally murdered the wrong person and made a mistake?

            "content": "Mystic River is a classic example of what is referred to as an \"actor's movie.\" Big monologues, gnashing of teeth, tearing of scenery.Being an actor's movie is not necessarily a bad thing. Big stars want to be in them. And actor's movies often win Oscars in the actor-heavy Academy.But that doesn't make them great movies. Mystic River is a hybrid script, combining drama with the detective/crime forms, where the seams show. And the closer you look at the script the more you see how failures in story structure and genre make this highly ambitious film ultimately disappointing.Mystic River uses the classic technique of showing the three lead characters as boys, when one of them is molested. The rest of the story therefore has to turn on how one boy's ghost haunts all the boys as adults. But this central connection is never made. Yes, the molested boy, Dave, is a broken man. But the other two, Sean and Jimmy, seem to be no different than they were as kids. And Dave's horror has no real effect on them as adults.In short, the ghost creates drama, but it is irrelevant to the drama in the present. When the detective/crime genre is added to the drama, the viewer keeps looking for the connection that will make each pay off to its fullest potential. This never happens. Thus the crosscutting between these two tracks in the body of the film simply doesn't work.On one track is the investigation. But this has a clumsy set up as well. The script is so heavy-handed in suggesting that Dave committed the murder of the girl that we know he obviously didn't. Clearly this movie is going to be about, among other things, false accusation. But this way of introducing theme is not good for surprise and plot. We may not know who did it, but we sure as hell know it wasn't Dave.As this investigative line plays out, we dig into another ghost concerning Jimmy's past life of crime. But none of this is played out in the present, so it has very little revelatory power.What's worse, to keep the false accusation line alive, the writer has Dave's wife tell Jimmy she thinks Dave killed Jimmy's daughter. This is so overwhelmingly stupid and unbelievable that the moment comes across as a plot contrivance, immediately kicking the viewer out of the movie-going experience.The second track of the film is provided by the drama of losing a daughter. This gives the actors a lot to chew on. But the drama is ultimately hollow, because the girl has not been a character in the present and she has had no effect on any of the major characters except Jimmy.The full disappointment of the movie comes after Sean tells Jimmy who really killed his daughter. The false accusation theme is pretty much dropped. Jimmy's wife, suddenly sounding like a modern-day Lady MacBeth, tells him he could be the king of this town. And Sean's estranged wife finally talks to him on the phone and returns. None of it makes any sense. But it does suggest that this film could have really expanded at the end had it been set up properly at the beginning.Mystic River shows the potential power as well as the many pitfalls of writing a transcendent crime story, detective story or thriller. Combining one of these genres with drama so that both lines work through each other is extremely complex (see the Detective, Crime and Thriller Course). But just attempting it is enough to set your script apart and get you the attention that every writer in Hollywood needs to succeed.FOR MORE REVIEWS, please visit www.truby.com",

It is a film based on the acting, and not on special effects, shootings or race of cars.

It shows how different people cover up crimes in their own unique way, whether committed by them or committed against them.  But not only does it do all of these things.  It does them beautifully.  Clint Eastwood's haunting, yet serene score along with amazing cinematography further the effect.  The acting of all involved is Oscar-worthy.Mystic River is definitely one of the best of 2003.  It makes one think, it makes one cry.  It gives one chills, it gives one powerful emotion.  I found it impossible to watch this movie from a distance, but became involved from scene one.  Let yourself become involved too, and you also will see the beauty of Mystic River.",

Seeeing cement drying, and decide to carve their names in it. Sean and Jimmy carve theirs but just as Dave is about to do his, a car appears with two cops. They tell them off and then ask where they live. Dave lives elsewhere, so the cops go to take him home to tell his Mom what hes been doing. Three days later Dave is found in the woods, \"damaged goods\". From that moment on, all three of their lives are changed. So begins one of the best movies of the 21st Century. A movie that is not afraid to deal with paedophilia and it's effects, this benefits from some brilliant acting from Sean Penn (Jimmy,an ex-con out of prison who's daughter is killed, which sparks off the events that occur 25 years after that ill-fated ride) and Tim Robbins (Dave, the poor bastard who is taken by two guys and years later still suffers from the consequences). I am not surprised of the recognition Clint is getting for this movie, along with \"The Million Dollar Baby\". My only question, Clint's done paedophilia and euthanasia, what's next, abortion?",

I like Clint Eastwood and I think he has both acted in and directed many superb films over the last 40+ years; his last few films have not lived up to his high standards though.  Blood Work, Space Cowboys and True Crime...you've seen, or at least heard of, the evidence.  I honestly believed he was finished making movies one could consider great.  I thought Unforgiven would be remembered as his swan song.  I was very wrong.Mystic River has to be the best Hollywood movie this year.  If I see one that tops it it would have to be great on the level ofLawrence of Arabia or Dr. Strangelove.  While this film is not on par with Lean or Kubrick's masterpieces, it is definitely one of Eastwood's finest and may surpass Unforgiven, one of the finest Western's I've seen.  I can't think of much I can write about the story or plot that wouldn't betray something of importance.  Every piece of information given to the audience somehow seems vital to the story's weaving and unravelling.  The story unfolds over what seems to be four or five days at the most.  It involves three men who were once best friends in their youth until an horrific event splinters their tight cell.  They remain in Boston as adults and thirty years later they are reunited by a single event that pits one against the other.  This synopsis is a little vague--for a reason though.  Once you see it you will realize why the previews were just as ambiguous in their revalations. Trust me.  You should see it.  It will not disappoint.",

This is a stunning, deeply involving film with tragic depth and great emotional power. To begin with, Dennis Lehane's novel provides a strong base on which to build. Even the title is superb, and resonates through every word of the book and frame of the film. Eastwood's work is splendid, not a false move made, and exceptional performances elicited from all the performers--to say nothing of the evocative cinematography and the music (Eastwood's work, too, in large part). As for the cast, if none of the male leads get Oscars it may well be because they wind up splitting votes. Sean Penn is simply incandescent; his rage and fire give the movie much of its impetus. Tim Robbins is also stunning. His performance is eloquent, beautifully controlled and modulated throughout. He is touching in conveying a man struggling under a virtually unbearable burden of guilt and memory. Kevin Bacon's work is hardly less fine in a somewhat less gratifying role. These three characters, linked and bound by a common thread, provide the film with its main force. Also admirable in their contributions are Marcia Gay Harden as Dave's fretful, frightened wife, Laura Linney as the passionate and definitively supportive wife to Jimmy, and (in a counterpart role) Laurence Fishburne as Sean's cop partner. Virtually every secondary performance makes its own points. Some people seem to have found the movie \"slow.\" I find that sad..the movie is deliberate like a largo movement of a great piece of music is deliberate...but SLOW? No way. Eastwood may be our finest working filmmaker today--he is surely one of the very best, when he has the components to work with, as he has here.

At first sight, it appears that the Kevin Bacon character, the detective, is letting his childhood friend, Sean Penn, get away with the murder of their mutual childhood friend, Tim Robbins.  I have to believe that when Bacon makes a shooting gesture at Penn, that he is saying, \"I'm going to get you\", and Penn's return gesture of spreading his hands is saying, \"Hey, do what you gotta do\".  Otherwise, the ending truly IS repulsive.  The reason I go with my interpretation is that Bacon's partner, Fishburne, would not let it go.  Yes, maybe Bacon did not tell him about his last conversation with Penn, but Fishburne was a little more tenacious than that.",

            "content": "*SPOILERS AHEAD !!!*After waiting a long time before I was finally able to watch it on DVD two days ago, I was so deeply disappointed by that film I had read so many brilliant reviews about. First of all, it's not the actors' fault. They delivered stunning performances, especially Tim Robbins. It's fascinating to see how a tall man like him can be so small and meek. Sean Penn did also well, and Kevin Bacon was good as always, but his character just didn't leave him as much space for perfect acting, unfortunately.After the film was finished, I was left with a strange feeling of disappointment, dissatisfaction and a certain emptiness. Nothing of the film remained with me, no scene still lingered with me. Know what I mean? The film didn't really leave any impression on me. After looking forward to it for so long, I didn't know what had happened.And then I watched it again, with the audio commentary on. But, sorry, although I like to see Mr Robbins and Mr Bacon as actors, they don't know how to do a good commentary. I didn't learn anything new about the film, no interesting background information, no funny stories about the shooting. So I turned the commentary off again. But while watching again I noticed several things which probably had bothered me. The first scene with the boys where Dave gets into the car took away most of the tension. If the viewer wouldn't know about Dave's fate, the story would have been definitely more interesting, not that slow, more thrilling and so on. Other scenes like that where Dave comes home with his hands full of blood, should have been shot in a different way. His bloody hands were barely to be seen, there was no initial shock for the viewer. A different camera work could have done the trick. The phone calls by the cop's wife had nothing to do with the story. Why were they there? Cut them out. And like that it goes on.To sum it up, I really can't recommend this film. With this cast and that director it could, it should have been a brilliant, perfect film. It is not. And this is an unbelievable pity. 5 out of 10. At best.",

            "content": "Quickly, Mystic River is a Scorcheesy film with a smaller budget for music licenses. Three childhood friends take different paths through life (think The Departed), and like Departed, it takes place in Boston, where everyone loves to murder as much as possible. Kevin Bacon, in a very understated, realistic role as the serious-kid-turned-cop turns in a great performance in a movie with a bit of overacting from Sean Penn and the usually great Tim Robbins, plus their associated significant others and children. I really did like Kevin Bacon in this- maybe one of his best roles ever.I saw the twist coming from about the 45 minute mark. Sean Penn's daughter is brutally beaten and shot dead. Like most murder mysteries, it's never the childhood friend, or the wife/boyfriend/girlfriend. While the story here is functional, that Sean Penn has it in his head that the disturbed, abused Tim Robbins is the likely culprit, while Sheriff Bacon stands in as the narrative device for the audience who isn't convinced by the unreliable narrator type story that Robbins weaves. The killer is usually someone associated with a secondary party, and in this case- it's the brother of the boyfriend of the deceased that does the deed. I think the voice on the 911 call gives it away that a young person was involved- and I caught the \"her\" on the call when the rushed voice asked \"what's her name\" before hanging up. It's revealed later that Sean Penn killed Ray Harris, the father of the boy who kills Sean Penn's daughter. I think the only thing the story is missing is that somehow, Ray Harris Jr should have found out that Sean Penn killed his father, and kills the daughter in revenge because he can't understand how his brother could be in a relationship with someone who had hurt his family like that. The explanation given is that Harris Jr and his friend were playing around with a gun in the street and accidentally shot the girl- which totally removes the dramatic tension and tragedy of it. I suppose that the real tragedy is supposed to play out between Bacon, Penn, and Robbins, but it's not very satisfying when Penn and Bacon mutually shrug at the murder and wrongful death of their mentally unstable friend.6.5/10 but with that added change I mentioned, 7/10.",

I didn't understand why Dave's wife believed he was guilty so soon; why she immediately made the leap from the story he told her about the mugger to him killing Jimmy's daughter.  And then why she went to Jimmy rather than to Sean.  She had to know what Jimmy would do.  Was there something in the book to explain this?

I was more interesting at how it would turn out. I mean, there are some really good homocide/mystery movies (and TV series) out there. Would this be one of them? Well, there was only one way for me to find out. To rent it!Jimmy, Sean and Dave are three friends who are out playing one day. They're just having fun, when suddenly a man dressed a police officer shows up. They take Dave away, telling him they're gonna go talk to his parents. But what they don't know is that these men are child molesters... Dave eventually manages to escape, but the child molesters are never caught.Many years later, when they are all grown up and married and have gone their own separate way: Tragedy strikes. Jimmy's daughter is found dead in a park, and a homocide investigation starts off, with Sean in the lead. It turns out that on the same night that Jimmy's daughter was murdered, Dave did something bad... Noone knows what, except for Dave, but his wife saw him come home all covered with blood. So, something is definitely up.Clint Eastwood directs nicely, different angles, nice colors and everything. The whole thing is very nice set up. Production design, photography, script and so on and so on. The dialoge is convincing, and the actors all do their part well. It's always nice to see Sean Penn in a role, but to have Kevin Bacon and Tim Robbins in there as well, is almost to much.I have two grudges with this film: Firstly, it's somewhat slow. At least the latter part of the film. The film ends at about 2 hours and 10 minutes, but it could easily have been 20 minutes shorter than that. My second grudge is when the killer is finally caught, it's not who you suspect it to be. But the reason for that, is because it's a very underdeveloped character who only popped up in two or three scenes prior to that, and there were absolutely no clues about it. It makes the investigation feel a bit \"anti-climactic\". But I'm willing to forgive that. You see, something else happens in the end, and I think this is what we're supposed to focus on. I won't tell you what it is, you'll have to see it for yourself. That is the real end to the film, and not the solve of the crime.All in all, it's a pretty good film, that drags on after awhile. I think that being slow is the worst crime a movie can commit, but it's not that bad in this film. You might not want to watch it more than once tho, so I'd say this is mostly a \"rent\" film and not a \"buy\" film.7/10",

As young boys growing up in a working class section of Boston, Jimmy Markum, Sean Devine and Dave Boyle spent their days reveling in their youthful innocence until one event drastically alters the course of their lives, Dave Boyle's in particular.  Thirty years later, Jimmy Markum's eldest daughter is found dead, and the three old friends (whose lives took separate paths) are reunited under less than harmonious circumstances.  Later, Dave is targeted as a suspect in the girl's death. Sean, now a police detective (Kevin Bacon), along with his partner Whitey Powers (Laurence Fishburne), is assigned to the investigation.  From here dramatic fireworks erupt in key scenes such as when Jimmy discovers what has happened to his daughter, when a shaken Dave comes home covered in blood to his stunned wife, Celeste (Marcia Gay Harden in a perfectly crafted, Oscar-nominated portrayal), when Celeste confides in Jimmy about Dave, and Jimmy and Dave's final confrontation.  The only main character who seems woefully misplaced is Annabeth (Laura Linney), Jimmy's second wife.  She has very few scenes anyway, and doesn't know what to do with the scant screen time she has.  Annabeth has a powerful speech towards the end, but parts of it defy comprehension.  She has a dramatic point to make, but it only comes across halfway.  The same argument for Fishburne's stereotypical role as a sarcastic, platitude-uttering cop.  He just doesn't bring much depth to his role.  The real meat of the film lies in the deeply emotional (and personal) performances of Sean Penn, as Markum, and Tim Robbins, as Boyle (both men won Oscars for their gripping work).  Bacon is good, too, as Devine, but the subplot involving his faceless wife is extremely diverting (this must be the story's way of involving his personal background).  Also, what conclusion(s) can the viewer make from the final scene?  A mixed bag by Eastwood, but undeniably compelling.  ***",

The movie is great, and deserves everyone ounce of praise it has received. Great acting, great directing, great pretty much.. everything. The problem here lays withing the fact that I read the book before watching this movie. Because of that I notice things that were left out of the book, that I honestly would have loved to have seen. Plus, having some of those things would have made the movie flow a little more smooth. Two characters from the book were left out. I could think of one scene in particular with this character; it may not have made that much of a difference in the movie, but the scene would have been awesome. Scenes do have to be changed, I get it. Some scenes had much more impact on pages than on screen. Jimmy killing Dave in the end. In the book they very subtly told you that Jimmy cut him with a knife. It wasn't *stab stab stab*. It almost had you wondering if Dave was ever cut at all, then shot. It just made the scene much more intense IMO. I really did like the movie overall; but because I loved the book so much, some scenes had my eyes wandering to other random things going on, like, why did Jimmy walk outside, put on his glasses, then two seconds later take them back off. Stupid, I know.I highly recommend the movie, and highly recommend the book even more.",

They'll craft an overblown, self-indulgent, and absolutely crass piece of work like `Mystic River,' and immediately the critics will outdo each other with praise filled with enough high-sounding adjectives to generate a thesaurus of their own. But let a woman make a meaningful, intelligent film about women and men, or, god forbid, only women, and she'll be immediately attacked with the narrow gamut of vocab reserved for `chick flicks.' It makes you really, really sad.\nI actually went to metacritic.com and read me the stellar reviews written by our major movie critics for `Mystic River.' Having seen the film last night, and having being variously puzzled, irritated, bored, and enraged by it, I had to see for myself what the critics saw in it that was so wonderful. Answer: you won't find out from the reviews. The above-mentioned critics are so busy telling us what a masterful director Eastwood and masterful actor Sean Penn are, and what masterful acting the director elicited from Tim Robbins, Kevin Bacon, Marcia Gay Harden and Laura Linney, that they forget to give us a, you know, reading of the film (which you thought movie criticism was all about). But hey, this is Oscar material, what can you do? Gotta be handled with kid gloves.So, since I have no Oscar-related obligations whatsoever, let me give you my reading of the film. Guys, meaning men, meaning white men, are very fragile and very fierce creatures. They are tough and powerful and all that, but when you hurt them, when you really hurt them, they thrash around in agony like wounded lions and bring a lot of destruction and self-destruction around them. Since, however, this is the majesty of the white male human animal, one can only look on in awe and marvel and terror. The enormity of the white male condition is such that criticism is really beyond the point. In `Mystic River,' men hurt, god they hurt, but they also rage, and Eastwood, not one to pull back when it comes to marveling at the majesty of the WMHA, shows the two emotions battle each other as if such battle were a true-blue epic. Beyond epic: as if it were metaphysics and existentialism and fate and cosmic law rolled into one. Heck, he even wrote his own gloomy score to accompany the drama of it all! So you see what I mean when I say that men are forgiven a whole lot in this world. Because this stuff, all metaphysics and epic aside, is as boring as s***. And I mean it, from the bottom of my heart.Oscar Prediction:  Best Director (Eastwood) and Best Actor (Penn) for this lousy film.",

I realized soon enough that what is \"obviously true\" wouldn't be true here -- that wouldn't be much of a movie. But the actual plot solution is not nearly as complicated as one might imagine, or hope. Sorry, I don't want to get too specific, so as not to spoil it for anyone.Secondly, Eastwood is a competent director, but not particularly interesting, really. A few of his tendencies are starting to become cliches for him -- the overhead helicopter shots, the camera panning to the sky when we see the dead girl, the way he hits us over the head with flashbacks (just in case we are too stupid to remember them) -- I feel like I saw it all in A PERFECT WORLD, which is, for my money, a better film.",

Overall, a good attempt at \"real\" moviemaking, that has left me in search of the book,  to see who bears responsibility for : the badly explained murder motive, the out of place and illogical \"King of the Family\" speech, the curious \"gun point\" by the police man who had ignored an obvious murder and the silly, non-talking wife who calls regularly. Flawed screenwriting and editing aside, anyone who watched these performances and determined they were inferior or unworthy of their critical acclaim, has to point me to the movies and performances they are watching. And since I'm in a ranting mode, doesn't the Foreign  Press folks (Golden Globes) have it right.?

            "content": "The plot of \"Mystic River\" isn't much to begin with. It's not dumb by all means but definitely a little overused. Ironically many of the actors involved in Eastwood's latest directorial effort have at some point or another starred in other versions the same story which revolves around a group of childhood friends who years later are brought back together because of a murder.What makes \"Mystic River\" a tremendous achievement in regard to directing and acting is how well the characters are presented within their universe. I'm fascinated by the Irish-Americans in Boston where the movie takes place. They seem to be living on a planet of their own. A planet where moral dilemmas and crimes are justified through religion, Machiavellian workings of power and simple conservative leanings towards roman-catholic ideals. Brian Helgeland's script does a fine job by being the cornerstone for Eastwood's directing. Yet the writing itself isn't what make's this movie so good. Almost the entire strength of the story is being brought forth through Eastwood's meticulous direction.As so often in these movies, victims and perpetrators share the same space and they are almost interchangeable. What Eastwood does brilliantly here, is to show that these flaws are absolutely human, and maybe even understandable if not admirable. They manifest themselves over the years and creep up and one day a murder is just a murder, and death is another way of living. Within this paradox Eastwood creates an number of breathtaking moments that show how \"old school\" film-making still tops every trickery of the \"New Hollywood\". The flick takes deep breaths and flows along very slowly, maybe to slow for some viewers but the tightly knit atmosphere and the fine performances by this outstanding cast make sure that even when everything comes to a standstill and the camera focuses on one individual, nothing is out of place or boring.After having become a legend in the movies, Eastwood now turned his eye on the legends and mysticism of a small community that is bound by faith, grief, hate and a never ending cycle of violence that can't be forgiven since these people can't forgive themselves. A subject Eastwood has tackled before and now expands it into our time, which makes it even scarier at some point, because there seems to be no difference between the West in \"Unforgiven\" and the East of \"Mystic River\", and although so many have died no lesson has been gained.",

However, it gets lost somewhere. I'm not sure if I heard too much `buzz' surrounding this film that while going into it I was expecting more. It is a really great film, don't get me wrong, but too call it one of the best films of 2003 would be an over statement. It is a story about three childhood friends who reconnect years later after one of their daughters is murdered. The story takes the audience on a wild journey through self-discovery and to a place that no one would like to find themselves. I know that this all may sound a little confusing, I'm saying it's not great but it is good. I can't exactly point out where I felt let down, but I can say that I was a little disappointed by the ending. I thought the story lead us to this horrible place only to say well it wasn't what you thought and the ending is not going to be completely cleared up.Probably the best aspect of the film is the performance that it's star Sean Penn turns in. This is by far one of the most outstanding performances of the year. He is extremely captivating; he does what not too many actors could have done. He makes you feel for his character only to turn against him for a split moment and then back to a place where you feel bad for him. Tim Robbins gave another amazing performance, this is probably is best to date. Marcia Gay Harden does an excellent job in a role that could have easily been over shadowed.

Nearly every scene was dragged out way to long and half way through the film I didn't care about any of the characters, which is bad considering the film is essentially a character study.  The ending is atrocious, not to mention highly unrealistic and predictable.  The last fifteen minutes felt like another hour as the final scenes go on, and on, and on, and on, and on, you get the point. The subplot with Kevin Bacon's character could, and should, have been completely left out as it has rare appearances and absolutely no bearing on the main plot.

Clint Eastwood wrote the score - I guess if you are Clint Eastwood, you can do about anything you like - but the music doesn't add anything. While I am dealing with the negatives, I must also add that a very few times the film teeters on the brink of melodrama. Beyond that I have nothing but good things to say. Eastwood's direction is steady, intelligent and sensitive. Most of the settings - indoor and out - are evocative, accurate and even mystical. Kevin Bacon as police detective Sean Devine is terrific. Of the three main characters, his is most centered, most normal, and that's how he plays it. Sean Penn will probably be nominated for Best Actor. The most memorable scene in the film - sadly one being widely shown in the trailers - is Penn's, and he delivers hugely. Tim Robbins' character is maybe the most demanding. His accent is consistent and believable, and he is one of those actors that can act with posture. Lawrence Fishburene, surely one of America's best male actors, is marvelously effective as Bacon's partner. This film isn't a ten, but it is a \"must see.\"",

You can't believe how bad it goes on the  'vampires' scene you hardly can contain your laughter, and last but not least Laura Linney who thinks that Bostonians speak like southerners????????? What's up with that ! The score is another flaw in the movie it rises to angelic heights at the worst of times and there are some blues tunes courtesy of Kyle Eastwood that should only be played when teaching how-NOT-to play the blues. On top of it, the real reason for why the girl is murdered, which I will give at the end as a spoiler, is changed in the movie to something completely bogus. Why they would do that is beyond me but it completely devalues the whole story. This is a long novel and a long movie, yet the flow of the story is just off, I don't know why and how but you'll know what i mean if you watch it. Folks, anyone that is giving this movie a rating higher than 7 must be caught in the last 5 year trend of media smooching towards Clint Eastwood films. This movie is just dull. 5/10...and I am being generous.SPOILER AHEADThe reason the girl is murder is because the young mute brother does not want his older brother to leave, since his brother is planning to marry the girl and leave, he kills her to keep the brother at home. In the movie the murder is attributed to an accidental shooting and the stealing of a car, which plays out as such a lame excuse that you have to contain yourself from throwing crap at the screen.

Both a haunting study of men on the edge, and a clever murder mystery, this marks Clint Eastwood's greatest latter-day film (\"The Outlaw Josey Wales\" stands in a much different place.). There is not a bad performance to be had in this harrowming, original American tragedy. There are bound to be Oscar nominations all around. Sean Penn delivers one of his best performances as vengeful Jimmy. As quiet Dave, Tim Robbins gives arguably his best performance ever. Kevin Bacon is great as Sean, the former childhood friend who escaped the old neighborhood and now lives life as a loser with a badge. Laurence Fishburn gives a fine supporting role that reminds us how he was great before he becaem Morpheus. Marcia Gay Harden, as Dave's frightened wife, gives a performance to eclipse her Oscar-win for \"Pollock.\" And Laura Linney, as Jimmy's wife, gives another good performance, if her character seems somewhat underdeveloped.The story of Jimmy, Dave, and Sean, three childhood friends who are all changed when Dave is abducted by two men posing as policemen and repeatedly molested before escaping, lends a frightening prologue to the events that encompass the rest of the film. When Jimmy's 19-year-old daughet Katie is found murdered following a night of bar-hopping, friends are reunited in the wake of her death. Sean is the homicide detective brought in to investigate. Dave's wife saw him come in with a nasty cut, a messed up hand, and someone else's blood on him, claiming it was a mugger. Jimmy starts his own hunt for his daughter's killer. Sean uncovers Katie's secret relationship with Brendan Harris, the son of a man who once ratted Jimmy out to the police. And the mystery surrounding Dave's whereabouts that night keeps coming up.Eastwood, who has turned out many good, and a few mediocre films, is at the top of his game, a first-time music credit tossed in the mix. Brian Helgeland, adapting Dennis Lehane's novel, resurrects the same gifts witnessed in his Oscar-winning script \"L.A. Confidential.\" The movie is a powerful, depressing story brilliantly told. It's not a movie to watch for fun, but it's worth the price of admission.",

            "content": "Before I watched this movie I had a good feeling this movie would be pretty good with the likes of Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, Kevin Bacon and Clint Eastwood as the Director. Those are some top actors along with Clint Eastwood it couldn't possible be a bad movie right? It was a suburb movie that was riveting the entire way, keeping you on your toes with who the killer is, and what is going to happen in the end.The movie starts out with the three young friends of Jimmy Markum (Sean Penn), Sean Devine (Kevin Bacon), and Dave Boyle (Tim Robbins) playing in the streets of their neighborhood in Boston. A supposed police officer catches them writing their names in the newly poured concrete. The man takes Dave and ends up kidnapping him for 4 days sexually abusing him the entire time. Dave gets away but the three's friendship will never be the same after.Skip 20 years ahead, Sean is a police detective whose pregnant wife left him six months ago, Jimmy is a small time gangster who owns a local store with his wife and three daughters, and Dave is married with a young son. Jimmy's nineteen year old daughter Katie is found dead one fateful night and Sean is the lead detective on the case. This is where the movie gets very interesting for me. The three friends that haven't really spoken to each other in years are all suddenly launched into a huge mess with a murder mystery gangster type thriller with the death of Jimmy's daughter.Jimmy is on a rampage to find his daughters killer, while detective and friend Sean is trying to do the same. Mean while Dave appears to be a prime suspect when he comes home cut and bloodied the night of Katie's death. As Sean and his partner continue to uncover more and more about Katie's death, Dave continues to seem more and more like Katie's killer. He appears so much like the killer that Dave's own wife rats him out to Jimmy the town gangster who is sure to inflict revenge on Dave.The movies ends in such a great yet horrible and dissatisfying way it's hard to say if I liked it or not. Jimmy kills Dave for presumable killing Katie, but then Sean finds the two young boys who actually did kill Katie the same night Jimmy killed Dave. Then the aftermath of this all is very awkward to me Jimmy's wife's speech calling him a King, Sean knowing Jimmy killed Dave but does nothing about it. As I said before the ending was very different and a little confusing to me but yet it was perfect for the movie on how it ended.I think it is impossible to compare this movie to any other for myself. I can not think of any movie that comes close to this. There are a few movies that have a similar theme that you don't find out the mystery till the end. Movies like the sixth sense, the departed, Se7en and a whole lot of other movies. But Mystic River is in a class of its own. The way the movie is set and how the characters are along with the ending, nothing compares.Two thematic techniques I thought the film utilized very well were lighting and camera zoom. I think the lighting was very important; it was a dark and gloomy movie so you can't have tons of sunshine or bright colors all around the set. Throughout the movie the lighting stayed very dark and gloomy to following along with the story line. Also the camera zoom had a big effect on the movie as well. As with any movie certain shoots were up close and others were shot from a distance. This is what the director has to determine when shooting the entire film. Do you shoot this scene up close to capture the emotion of the actors or do you shoot from a distance to get a good picture of what is happening around the actors. It may seem like a easy thing to accomplish but I would argue it is harder then it might seem. I think these two elements are crucial for mystery movies like the Mystic River. You have to be able to see actor's emotions when they are being shown. You can't be at a distance when Sean Penn is crying over his daughter's death or you will not be able to fully grasp the emotion his character is showing. If you shoot each scene up close you would not be able to see all the scenery which helps create the dark and gloomy nature of the film.All in all it is a great movie to watch, the ending is a little suspect. But I greatly enjoyed the movie and I would recommend it to any movie watcher who enjoys this type of movie.",

            "content": "Caution... **SPOILERS**For the last 20 years I've been working the field of Mental Health so I really looked forward to seeing Mystic River. I finally got to see it this past weekend. I found it interesting but... 1. I felt that I needed to know what happened after Dave, as a child, came back after being abducted and met his friends again. A great deal of the movie revolves around the relationship of the three boys when they become adults, but we are never shown what happens in their relationship when Dave returns. I felt that that was something that really needed to be clarified. Near the end of the movie, one says something like, \"We all went into that car\". Why were Dave's two friends that affected by Dave's abduction?2. I have no idea why Dave was ever considered a suspect in the murder of the daughter of Sean Penn's character. His being sexually abused as a child would have NO connection whatsoever in a murder of a teenage girl when he is an adult. It just doesn't make sense.3. Why didn't Dave tell his wife the truth about the murder? He told her he thought he might have KILLED someone but he came up with a convoluted story. Why? If he didn't feel comfortable sharing that he had been abused as a child with her, I still don't understand why he couldn't say that he saw a man sexually abusing a boy and he beat the man and might have killed him.4. The movie doesn't explain how Dave got stabbed. When he sees his wife after the \"murder\" she takes care of a stab wound of his. When we later see him attacking the child molester, I don't recall the man having a knife and Dave pretty much beats him to death. So how did Dave get stabbed?5. Would a child molester really have sex in a car parked outside a popular bar? 6. The two men in a car abduct Dave and hold him hostage. Two men? I found that hard to believe. When Dave is abducted, his two friends SEE both men, can DESCRIBE both, see their car, and see the car's LICENSE PLATE. Yes, the two men pretended to be cops, but if you are with your friend, and he gets picked up by the cops, I really think you are going to go to your friend's mother and let her know right away. Why didn't the boys tell Dave's parent? Why didn't the police immediately get involved?7. Why didn't Kevin Bacon's character take himself off the investigation when he learned that it was regarding his childhood friend?8. Sean Penn's character calmly speaks with the investigators immediately after he learns of his daughter's murder! There is NO WAY that he would be in any state of mind to speak to investigators on that day. It's just not realistic.Clint Eastwood made a movie that is emotional but it has so many loopholes in the plot that it just didn't seem plausible.Does the book answer the questions?",

Sean Penn  tries his best to capture the horror but he may be trying too hard.  He is good but it is just short of the mark.Tim Robbins is the character that one cannot forget. He is tortured and mystical as well as pragmatic and understated. His work is worth award consideration I feel.To stay away from spoilers I won't visit the outcome of the story.  But let's say this. It took some real metal for my wife and I to make it all the way through some of the very hard scenes.  In the end we were glad  we hung in there and I think you will be too.

Once again, virtues that most people value - friendship, loyalty, compassion, faith, truth, justice, love - are utterly trashed. Lawlessness and deception are extolled. Human existence is absurd, life without value,and conscience serves no purpose. Naturally, Eastwood's materialistic world view can make no sense out of something as tragic as pedophilia. I'm far from being puritanical, but I must say: evil pervades this film. I've seen plenty of reviews lavishing (or should I say, squandering) praises on both the acting and directing. So what? Neither acting nor directing are value neutral. Excellence at the service of evil doesn't redeem either a story or a film. I realize that this brief synopsis of the moral morass Mystic River represents will not endear me to reviewers at IMDb. Vox populi - haven't 8 out of 10 already told us how wonderful the film is? This great majority has merely shown how incapable the average viewer is of showing the most basic discernment. Fortunately, most viewers don't live by the twisted values in the film.

It's a serious, masterfully told piece of work, and everything from acting to direction to music is (not surprisingly) solid across the board...even though at times, admittedly, the film's somewhat dreary, schmaltzy tone could get a little manipulative; thankfully, such is a very, VERY minor complaint in a sea of praise for this amazing piece. One can't stop raving about the performances themselves - particularly from the spectacular trio of male leads: Sean Penn, Tim Robbins and Kevin Bacon. Absolutely astonishing and Oscar-worthy - every single one of them, and then some (supporting players, etc.) Granted, it took me a little while to get used to their sometimes grating Boston accents, but in time their convincing personalities and dilemmas grew on me heavily.In a time where, to be brutally honest, the amount of genuinely good films is dwindling to a respectable few, \"Mystic River\" is a very welcome surprise for me. Taut, suspenseful, and emotional, it's a wonderful start to the much-anticipated fall season of potential award-winning films.",

            "content": "***MAJOR Plot Spoilers Ahead***Having just finished watching this movie, I'm almost forced to review it. This is one of those movies that no matter the slating a reviewer gives it, you'll see it anyway because of the hype and the 'Oscar talk'. The only Oscar that needs to be given is perhaps to Marcia Gay Harden for her above-stellar acting, especially given the atrocious script and storyline. Her expression at the end is Oscar worthy in itself...So what exactly is wrong with the movie? Well, - the biggest problem is that it's one long mess that ends on such an anticlimactic note that I feel that you can only come away shaking your head. I sat there towards the end, thinking about all the misdirection and contrivances and wondering how any sane person can actually think the story clever. Much like the horrible 'Runaway Jury', I felt my intelligence insulted, and wanted very much to leave before the end and forget the torrid experience of having seen the movie.Let's see...Part 1:Brendan's mute brother and his friend just HAPPEN to get Brendan's father's gun and just happens to BY MISTAKE shoot it at Katie's car one night. (Katie of course, the day of her demise, - just HAPPENED to give her father 'a funny look that indicated that she wouldn't see her father again' because she just HAPPENS to be heading to Vegas that weekend with Brendan.) Anyway, Brendan's mute brother and his friend decide that they'd rather not get into trouble for firing a gun and decide to do the smart thing which is - chase Katie into wood and beat her around for a bit with a hockey stick. Then, (and why not?) - fire the gun into her head. Yeah....right. Talk about clich\u00e9d. Then, for some completely stupid reason, Brendan's brother and friend call the police? I guess they suddenly felt guilty for having beaten the living crap out of Katie and then having shot her. Right. Yeah. That must be it.Part 2:Here we have poor Dave, who for some ridiculous reason is married to Celeste, which makes no sense since Dave is obviously disturbed. The night that Katie is killed, Dave just HAPPENS to be in the same bar that Katie went to (the last one she went to - of course), and just HAPPENS to get into a fight with a paeodphile on the way home, and also just happens to get cut pretty bad. He then just happens to put the molester in his trunk and the molester just HAPPENS to have the same blood type as Katie (but of course!). Then he comes home and tells his wife that he was 'mugged'. I mean, of COURSE you wouldn't tell your wife that you stopped a child molester at work. I mean, telling the truth to your wife is a STRICT no-no, non?\nWord of the day folks: contrived, contrived, contrived. Oh wait, - that's three words. Oh nevermind.So apart from the ridiculous plot, we have some ridiculous characters too. Katie's female friends, even though KATIE IS DEAD, have some trouble telling the cops who Katie's boyfriend is. Riiight. That makes sense. Then you have Laura Linney giving this completely ridiculous speech at the end about howher husband, Sean Penn, is the greatest guy, no matter what he does. I mean, it's all about defending the family, right? There's more, but I'd rather not waste any more thought on this hokum.\nFinal word is that this is honestly one of the worst movies I've seen. I came away not just disappointed, but also rather miffed, and definitely bitter about the whole thing. Penn, Bacon, Gay Harden, and Robins acted well as they always do. Just one hell of a shame about the movie.\n5 poos out of 5.",

PLEASE DO NOT READ ANY FURTHER!Oh come on, one can allow a coincidence or two, but three!? The blame goes to the author (not \"LA Confidential\" scripter Brian Hegleland,  unless he altered the book).  In the story, poor Dave waits, what more than 25 years?, then commits a heinous murder at precisely the time the other victim is murdered.  Same day, same time.  And who commits this horrible act, not only a pair of unlikely criminals, but a duo who seem totally unlikely to then chase her and beat her and shoot her a second time!  Two absurdities. But then, of course, the third strike is the misguided act of revenge that occurs JUST before to this case being solved.  \nLook, if the set-up is going to be worthy, such contrivances reduce a wonderfully crafted work to a cheat.

Even when you know what's ahead you're pretty much engrossed by some emotional bludgeoning from some character or other. The underlying tension - the events, unshockingly portrayed at the beginning of the film, slowly burn inside of Tim Robin's head but we never really get to sample the uncertainty he holds within. Perhaps this is meant to reflect the messed-up nature of the character but it simply comes across as confused.The end is strange too - as if it was added to please someone - and it really gives nothing to the previous events.

Naturally, \"Mystic River\" was at the top of my list. But unfortunetly, I never got to it, and it seemed to vanish from my memory.....until it won Best Picture at the National Board of Review. Then what do you know? It stops playing at theaters near me on Friday, so I only had a few days left before it was to late. After seeing it, I am glad I saw it before it was too late.\"Mystic River\" starts out as one story, then goes to three stories, and then back to one. It starts out in Boston in the late 70's. Three young friends are writing their names on the sidewalk when a man, who appears to be a cop, takes one of them away, and....well, there is no easy way to say it. So flash forward 25 years later and the boys grow up to be Sean Penn, Kevin Bacon, and Tim Robbins. Penn (the neighborhood thug), is trying to come to terms with his daughter's recent murder. Bacon is a detective assigned to the case, while trying to communicate with his pregnant wife who recently walked out on him. And Robbins (the one who was kidnapped), is slowly loosing his sanity. And to top it off, he is a suspect in the case, and his wife (Marcia Gay Harden) expects something. Also along for the ride is Lawrence Fishburne as Bacon's partner, and Laura Linney as Penn's second wife.What keeps this above the level of an ordinary cop movie, is the powerful performance by Robbins and Penn, the master storytelling by Eastwood, and the classic 'Stephen King-like' theme of lost innocence. This is the best ensemble acting since \"Magnolia\". When the film was released, this was lots of praise for Penn's performance. But in my opinion, Robbins performance was just as good, and Harden also did a nice job. There was only one thing that bothered me with this film (and it is nothing big): Like others have mentioned, they should have left it with Penn walking down the street. But the rest of the film is excellent. This is the best of 2003, and I hope this goes far at the Oscars. And even if it doesn't, this will still be the best of 03, and nothing can change that.This film is hard to watch in some points, and is very sad (especially Robbin's character), but still an excellent story with superb acting.

He doesn't look down on his audience; he assumes they have an attention span that will get them through a movie more than ninety minutes long.

Tim Robbins gave one of his best performances ever in this film, you feel hunted just by watching this guy, it was an amazing performance that draws you in and won't let you go, you really believe him as this character and, like Sean Penn he deserved his Oscar. Kevin Bacon also gave a strong performance, and both Laura Linny and Marcia Gay Harden deserved the academy award far more than Renee Zelwigger did for Cold Mountain.Clint Eastwood's direction was superb, everything in this movie was done so powerfully and yet so subtley that you feel like you are watching real life.Clint Eastwood has a very unique approach to dealing with his actors, giving them more room to go with what they want to do then just what he want's. I still find it fascinating that two of the best director's of our time, Clint Eastwood and Micheal Mann can be the exact antithisis of each other in the way they run their sets and work with the people who are working for them.I rarely devote a paragraph to a musical score but this time I think it is warranted. It was also composed by Clint Eastwood. It amazed me how incredibly well it fit the feel of the film, a little dark and gloomy, very subtle. It doesn't give you and uplifting bravora style of a musical score but something that is simply made to exentuat the ambiance of the film. Its rare to see a director compose the score to his film but this was just as good as any of the greats like Hans Zimmer, James Horner, or John Williams could have done.It is easy to loose yourself in this film, it is easy to forget that you are in the theater, or now, sitting on the couch watching it. The writing, the acting, the set all seemed so real to me. The 8.1 stars that this film has posted isn't a fluke, it is truly deserving of a high user rating, in fact I wish it was higher. This isn't just one of the best films of the year, this is one of the best films ever made. I would recommend this movie to anyone, anytime, anyplace. If you can't see the brilliance of this film you need to get your eyes checked.",

The whole hangs on the screenplay and this is where the director gets the chance of a career to make something brilliant. Oh I know Eastwood has Penn, Bacon, Linnet and Robbins. Tim Robbins gives the really great performance. Better than Shawshank. He is so broken, the target all bullies zero in on. Penn as happens with him chews the scenery. The Bacon character is wonderfully played. Sure he has such a sympathetic character but he is fantastic. The setting of old Boston falling into the River is wonderful. But what makes Mystic River such a great film are the whole cast. With the exception of Penn they all give the other actor the chance to shine.I think when Eastwood is asked which movie to be remembered for, this will be the one.A must watch for anybody who loves modern urban American films.",

            "content": "This was a terrific movie. There were shades of Shakespeare throughout. I am disappointed in the reviews which spiraled into sarcasm. I don't want to further add similar appreciative comments to the justifiably awed reviews by others. I would like to suggest a few things. As to the comment that the movie was homophobic, I find that skewed, if in reference to Dave's abductors. Homosexuals are not automatically child molesters. That assumption is homophobic. The questions regarding motives are too demanding. Human beings are, above all else, unpredictable. There are no neat and tidy explanations in the real world, and I think this movie captures that. Fear of reprisal has made people do seriously violent things, even things they would not have dreamed they were capable of. I would like to suggest Silent Ray's friend actually beat Jimmy's daughter to death, his wild behavior, swinging a gun at the end, shows an unstable character. It is actually believable. I am not surprised a cop would mingle with the underworld equally as well as the \"right side of the law\". I am not surprised Kevin Bacon's character does not arrest Jimmy, Dave's murderer. You can think many things: sadness, lack of evidence, regret or a personal choice based on a myriad of emotions. The end of the movie left a suggestion that Jimmy's eventual turn in life would lead him to seek a better position in the underworld, a world over which \"he could be king\", to quote his wife. Something in Jimmy died, during the days of his daughter's death and his choice to murder a childhood friend. You can see it in the coolness of his stance when he sees Kevin Bacon, and both of them know all secrets between them. I think I see things this way because I am nearly forty and I have seen many, many awful and beautiful things. Based on my personal experience, this movie is quite, unfortunately, believable. As for Kevin's wife, well her character is only there to suggest that Kevin's life is filled with his own problems. When Dave dies, she comes home, a little spiritual parallel to a new beginning, with leaving all life's evil behind. Well done.",

The narrative evolves around three childhood friends that were torn apart due to a tragedy, and are getting reunited after 30+ years when one of them finds his daughter murdered and mutilated. One of them (Kevin Bacon) has become a cop, one (Sean Penn) has become a notorious criminal and the last one (Tim Robbins) is still recovering from the horrific tragedy years earlier. We can already see that their different roles are in conflict, and the tension escalates dramatically when one of them is connected to the murder somehow. During the main plot, captivating smaller stories are being dug up during Bacon's police investigation, all of the them connects somehow towards the breathtaking end of the flick. It's well-made drama at its very core, masterful.Eastwood directs the movie gently and well. The camera is steady and shows some amazing landscape-shots of Boston, its quite beautiful. What is there to say about the performances except \"wow\"? Penn and Robbins' Oscars were very well deserved. Penn manages to catch the fragile balance between a tough mobster and a grieving father, one scene in particular on a porch shows why he's one of the greatest living actors today. Robbins manages to catch the emotionally conflicted character so well that your heart goes out to him. Honorable mentions goes to the amazing supporting cast, especially Harden and Linney's portrayals as grieving and confused wives.If you haven't seen this movie, do so. Eastwood catches man's raw, brutal nature and leaves with a conclusion so satisfying and shocking that makes \"Mystic River\" a movie you'll never forget. -MB",

Nothing much out of the ordinary ever happened, until a moment's decision drastically altered the course of each of their lives forever.Twenty-five years later, the three find themselves thrust back together by another tragic event the murder of Jimmy's 19-year-old daughter. Now a cop, Sean is assigned to the case and he and his partner are charged with unraveling the seemingly senseless crime. In the wake of the sudden and terrible loss of his child, Jimmy's mind becomes consumed with revenge and his own plans to find the killer. Caught up in the maelstrom is Dave, now a lost and broken man fighting to keep his demons at bay. As the investigation creeps closer to home, his wife Celeste becomes consumed by suspicion and fear, while Jimmy's wife, Annabeth, draws her family tighter together in order to weather the storm and keep the peace.There are times in my life, when I'm watching a movie, and I saw to myself, \"So this is why film was invented?' Well, when watching \"Mystic River\", that saying came to my mind. The performances by Sean Penn, Kevin Bacon and Tim Robbins are outstanding. Penn and Robbins were both given Academy Awards for best acting, and rightfully so.The film was also nominated for Best Actress in a \"Supporting Role, Best Director, Best Picture and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published\". The only films that I have seen of Clint Eastwood's, Director wise, are \"A Perfect World\" and \"Unforgiven\". Both are quite good. My favorite of the two is \"A Perfect World\".I never did read the novel. And now that I have seen and loved the film, I don't plan to. Because I may love the novel and end up hating the movie or something. It's the same way with \"Fight Club\" for me. Again, the cast is quite an amazing one at that. With Laurence Fishbunre giving a very well done performance as Devine's partner.Marcia Gay Harden plays Dave's wife and also gives it her all. Her performance is very convincing. I didn't really like Laura Linney in this movie. She didn't really seem to be at all interested in what was going on or something, I don't know lol. Eastwood takes this film seriously. Like there does not seem to be one good thing in anyone's life in this movie. All except for the one that gets murdered. The ending leaves you thinking, and a bit sad. At least I was. I saw this movie in theaters, and this one of the few times I have left a theater speechless.****1/2/*****",

I read the review by Roger Ebert, who I usually respect, and he gave this yawner 4 stars! I wonder if we saw the same movie! I didn't give a flip about one single character, not even Dave (Tim Robbin's character). I love Tim Robbin's work, but here he has little to do but look bewildered. I also had a very hard time hearing the movie. I kept having to turn the volume up to hear the whispered dialogue, and then it would immediately change to traffic or helicopter noise and it would just about blow my eardrums out!

Sean, a detective, and his partner are assigned to the case. Jimmy distraught by the death of his daughter goes about the business of handing out justice on his own, as Dave deals with the demons of the past. Clint Eastwood is a skilled storyteller who will keep you on the edge of your seat. The movie opens as three boys play hockey in the street. The picture is washed out and the brightest color in the frame is the red tape that protects the new cement on the sidewalk. A dark car pulls up, two hard looking men posing as officers, get one of the boys into the car. Ominous music plays in the background, your stomach turns when you see the boy look back at his friends from the rear window of the car. The boys look on helplessly as the car pulls away. Through skillful editing this movie employs techniques that leave the viewer scared for the characters and emotionally vested in the boys. The movement of the film is seamless as you watch the story unfold. The cinematography takes you away to this Irish-Catholic working class neighborhood. Dave is seen again with his own son, as they walk it can be felt that his experiences haunt him. The film cuts to flash backs and then to him, his eyes sorrowful. After being at the bar he comes home with blood all over his clothing and a cut to his chest, with a story of a mugging. At the same time Jimmy's daughter has not been home all night and no one is sure where she is. Sean is assigned an investigation into an abandoned car, which turns out to be that of Jimmy's daughter. The following sequences show the visceral reaction of Jimmy as he attempts find out what has happened to his daughter. The skillful editing adding to the intensity of the emotion as the film cuts to show the reactions of a father whose young girl is lost. Just when you feel you can't take any more, the camera lifts you up and away from the scene. As Jimmy starts to suspect that his childhood friend is responsible for the death of his daughter he takes matters into his own hands. Has he heads down this dark path, the lighting dims in the film, you can feel the danger upon Dave once again. The action cuts to Sean who continues to follow his leads. The light fades more and more from the film as Jimmy pursues his revenge and the boys who did kill his daughter are caught. The futility of revenge is fully realized in his blind anger he has killed a man who is not responsible for the murder of his daughter. This movie speaks to the effects of sexual abuse on its victims. The abuse suffered and then perpetuated by that same victim. This is a cycle of violence, guilt and revenge, without hope of resolution. I would recommend this film; it hooked me in and didn't let go. I would give it a 7 out of 10.",

            "content": "Mystic River is already being lavished with Oscar talk in a year that has seen precious few quality movies.While the movie is certainly worth seeing, I'd hardly call it great.  I think it's gotten inflated notices from the major critics simply because of the star power involved, especially Clint Eastwood.  \"Solid\" and \"Assured\" are the most overused words in reviews when describingEastwood's directing style.  Maybe those are euphemisms for unimaginative--I don't know.  I think Eastwood is being unduly praised for this film. \nHere are a few major criticisms -- some spoilers included.1)  The occasional \"flashes\" of memory, such as when Tim Robbins is staring at the pavement and \"flashes back\" to his childhood trauma, are unnecessary, and they actually undercut the tension created by the actors.2)  The scene in the bar, where Sean Penn's daughter comes in with her friends, rings so cheesy and false, it really shows how out-of-touch Eastwood is as a director.  It reminded me of bar scenes in movies in the 80s like Top Gun or The Accused, where situations feel so staged and unrealistic.  This scene in particular belonged on an episode of Nash Bridges, not an Oscar-worthy movie.3)  While Sean Penn and Tim Robbins deliver good performances, and Kevin Bacon holds his own, Marcia Gay Harden is horribly over-the-top.  Eastwood should have reined her in for her own good and the good of the movie.4)  As he did with \"Midnight in the Garden...\" Eastwood lets this film go on way too long. The Sean Penn/Laura Linney scene in the bedroom at the end is bizarre and emotionally confusing.  The parade scene seems to grope for an ending.  He should have ended the movie with Penn and Bacon walking away from each other.5)  The entire subplot with Kevin Bacon and his estranged wife is handled so poorly, and given such short shrift, it should have been cut completely.  Its use as an attempt to balance the tragedy of the story is almost cringe-worthy.\nMystic River is a decent film.  But before we all get too excited and give a mediocre film the best picture and best director award (can anyone say \"A Beautiful Mind\"?) let's actually watch the movie with a critical eye.",

            "content": "I'm reminded of a favorite teacher's old saying; \"Great films start when the lights go up.\"  I tend to believe in that theory, that a truly great film stays with you long after the final credit roll.  Mystic River is a great film, a truly, categorically, irretrievably great film.  It can't be less than it is.  The film seems to feel genuine pain, like it's a living thing, in that it can't be less than it is.  Some films strive to be more than they are, and there have been countless overblown dramas for centuries, most recently The Road to Perdition.  Other films delight in their greatness, accept and relish it, making it a part of their delivery.  But in Mystic River's case, it is a film in anguish, trying to make sense of its existence.  That is why I feel the main character of the film is Dave (Tim Robbins).I was drawn to Mystic River by two phenomena; seeing Unforgiven for the first time and being fully indoctrinated into the Clint-Eastwood-as-director fan club, and the other because of Stephen King's simple proclamation that there are few films that matter, really matter, and Mystic River matters.The film clocks in somewhere near 3 hours, and though I was immediately aware of how long it was, I was also immediately aware of precisely why it was so long.  There wasn't a single scene that didn't matter.  Not a single scene where the film lost momentum.  There were innumerable scenes which frustrated my companions of the evening, particularly the ending, but I was so enthralled I was not ready to leave this world.  You might weep when you last see Marcia Gay Harden's character.  I think about her, she's real to me now, and I want to help her.  I believe this is why the film wishes it were less.  I really think some people just won't be able to handle this film well, they'll wish it were dumber, shorter, more \"action\" packed, because this film is packed with the kind of action you don't want to watch for too long.  But it won't let go of you, won't let you off the hook.  You're in the know, at the end, and it's like finding out you've been cheated on.  You can't have things go back to the way they were before, you just wish it had never happened.  Dave's abduction truly drives this story, these people, it's all about what it did to them.  But Dave's abduction is also a scape-goat, and you see it in the final frames, and you wish everything were OK.  But three lives are ruined, and the final thought, maybe, is that these lives were ruined in their own way, at their own time, and that led to Dave's destination at the end of the film.Tim Robbins, Sean Penn and Kevin Bacon all deserve Best Actor nods, and the same is true for Marcia Gay Harden and Laura Linney.  The young boyfriend also deserves Oscar attention.  And of course, Eastwood for director.  If Mystic River doesn't win Best Picture, it will be one of the greatest second-place finishers in the history of film, and it will go on for years, haunting more and more viewers, redefining their lives in true ways.",

As a child it's pardonable but even as adults the only thing Sean Penn said was \"I last saw Dave was 25 years ago\" and Kevin Bacon juat lets him go..\nIn the end as long as u r a ex-mafia boss and bereaved father it's alright to kill someone without evidence and ur best friend will protect you. Again and again. As long as u keep sending money to the family of the dead??Really cudnt believe it and the messaging.\nAnd the murder mystery didn't make any sense.

Why did she say \"hi\" to them who were pointing gun at her.\nI haven't read the novel so maybe it's the literal adaption of it or not.. not sure .. but if it's not then the ending cud have much better....",

Clint Eastwood has done a masterful job as director in creating moments of intense drama, tension and emotion throughout this film.The Sean Penn-Tim Robbins-Kevin Bacon trio gives terrific performances (with Penn and Robbins especially solid). Laurence Fishburne of \"Matrix\" fame makes a nice turn here as Bacon's detective partner.The story centers around the loss of Penn's daughter Katie. Katie is seen only briefly in the film, which is a bit of shame because I would have liked to have established a little more connection to the character before she died. But the \"whodunit?\" element is only part of the story here, the main story is the now twisted relationship between three former childhood friends and their paranoid and distrust of one another.For all it's strengths, there is one plot hole that to me really hurts this film. *minor spoiler* The police seize Dave Boyle's(Robbins) car and discover blood in the back seat that is not his, furthering their theory that Dave killed Katie. Now the police could have easily run a DNA test comparing the blood in the car to Katie's blood (as they had access to her body) to determine if she really WAS in Dave's car that night, but there is not even a mention of such a test. *end spoiler*Despite this, this move is so well done that it still managed to impress me. Usually I get put off by a movie which has skipped/ignored very important facts, but not this time. It may be because I was more interested in the developing backstory of Penn's character Jimmy than in the truth about Katie. Mystic River is a terrific, emotional and a times disturbing trip into the human psyche. Enjoy it, because they don't make many like this.",

It is based around a murder mystery which leads to a tragic outcome. The murder summons childhood friends and their dark memories. In this background, Eastwood allows us to explore each of the characters, and to virtually understand the human nature. This film depicts the unexpected consequences of redemption, regret and all the deeply-rooted feelings of the human mind. All these things have been told in a very thrilling way, yet allowing you to dig into the deeper layers of this masterful film.Unforgettable performances come from the whole cast, especially from Penn and Robbins who become the victims of the tragedy, and from Bacon who is torn apart between them. Harden also skillfully portrays her hysterical betrayal of her husband, a mistake which defines the ending of the story.This film left me with a feeling similar to that I had after watching Godfather, perhaps because of the way the movie ended.

Because the acting (especially Penn and Robbins) is so good, you do care about the characters.   The story is well constructed with a beginning, a middle and an appropriate end.   But there is nothing to be learned here, no redemption, no nuggets of wisdom to be had.

Sean Penn is good but not that good, he isn't quite there with his character, you can see the actor underneath. Tim Robbins, however, is excellent as a man whose soul has been ripped out of him but he's still shambling onwards without it. His story is very moving but sometimes borders on the usual sentimentality. The music is occasionally irritating & there are occasionally excruciating directorial flashes like when, after Jimmy has realised it's his daughter dead, the camera pans slowly up into the sky. The moment is held far too long. But otherwise the sets are nice, spacious,almost clinical, to counter the messy emotions. One problem I found is that frequently I couldn't understand a word anyone was saying, even when rewinding and replaying a section of dialogue several times. Even with stupid uneducated people it is still possible to act them well but actually be understood. And I was confused about a lot of things - ie if the 3 main characters are meant to have grown apart why, after the murder, does Dave's wife suddenly seem to be Sean's wife's best friend? And other things seem a bit muddled and foggy but I can't put my finger on anything specific, it's just that things don't quite add up. Jimmy's wife's speech to him at the end almost defies belief - \"nothing you do can be wrong\"? Hello?- he's just brutally killed an innocent man on mistaken information and wrong conclusions when he wouldn't listen to the truth. The end also seems to drag on a bit, though Kevin Bacon's last gesture to Jimmy is interesting.",

            "review_title": "Perhaps Eastwood's best as a producer/director.",
            "content": "Clint Eastwood uses his trademarked helicopter shots better then he ever has in Mystic River, and their meaning has extra portent here: God watches over us all, but is ironically not always present.  Easily the director's best work since 1992's Unforgiven, it asks a parade of important questions about fate, which make it perfect movie-material, since films are all about, in Lars Von Trier's words, `the God's-eye-view.'  Shot by Tom Stern in a burnished, nostalgic style that, even in its mostly present-day sequences, suggests that its characters are permanently mired down by the past, it begins with young Boston punk Jimmy Markum enticing his buddies Dave and Sean into scratching their names into freshly-poured cement.  Dave is the last to print, but before he's done, he'll be lured by fear and insecurity into a car ride that changes his life for the worse.Suddenly, before the horror of this situation fully sinks in, we're vaulted thirty years later into the boys' adult lives.   Jimmy (Sean Penn), hair streaked gray and skin prison-weathered, is now the owner of a corner store, a longtime widower of a woman who bore him one daughter, Katie (Emily Rossum), then promptly died of cancer before she could see her husband free from a liquor store robbery rap.  Now remarried to Annabeth (a tough Laura Linney), and with a new passel of children, Jimmy seems to have found equilibrium in his life.  Meanwhile, Dave (Tim Robbins) is the haunted father of a boy who himself carries the weight of Dave's troubled past, who can't find the joy in simply playing baseball because he feels that his failures weigh on his dad even further.   Dave is now married to Celeste (Marcia Gay Harden), a shell-shocked housewife who dances as fast as she can to keep up with Dave's neuroses, but is soon to be overcome by an event that tests her faith in her husband's sanity.The third in the triumvirate, Sean (Kevin Bacon), along with his partner Whitey (Laurence Fishburne, excellent as the film's one detached, reasonable character), is called out to a Boston crime scene.   Sean has long since lost contact with his old friends, but the past is constantly hectoring him. Bedeviled by a damaged wife who ran away with their child and makes silent long-distance phone calls to her emotionally needy but distant husband (in the film's one overly-sentimental device), Sean has thrown himself wholly into his detective work as a way of forgetting all he's been through. When he and Whitey are called into his old neighborhood, Buckingham Flats, on a murder investigation, Sean knows this can't be good; Bacon's face shows the gravity of a life lived experiencing death in a myriad of forms.\nThus begins an overcast story that mirrors Unforgiven in profound ways. Whereas the Oscar-winning western explored the mercenary past of perpetrators who are constantly lying to each other and themselves, Mystic River takes the more difficult road in examining the indefensible crimes of victims: the crime of making wrong choices, of not fighting back, of not taking a stand and following long-held faiths in gods and loved ones. Because of this, Mystic River is one of the saddest movies I've ever seen, a whooshing, screaming peer into the lycanthropic existence of nightcrawlers who've been bitten by violence and betrayal.Certainly the centerpiece of the film is a scene between Robbins and Marcia Gay Harden, where Dave's demons come raring to the surface in a room illuminated only by the flickering image of a horror film on the television. Robbin's eyes burn through the screen as he brings us into Dave's firefly-ridden world of werewolves, vampires, and aliens.   The allegory is quite apt, and heartbreaking, just as the stories of such horror characters often are; once infected, victims like Dave only have to wait for the soul's full moon before they are once again transformed into a monster that knows not what he or she does.  Robbins' performance is a standout in his career, and certainly marks him as the frontrunner for a slew of yearend awards. He is tortured, panicked, darkened, confused, and dead inside.  Harden, too, stands out in this cast, with a character that's buffeted between truth and fiction, between perceived loyalty to a husband she's starting to mistrust, and a larger morality that demands she do the right thing, even if it might be the wrong thing.Eastwood is lucky to have Stern's shadowy yet sun-drenched photography at his disposal-it makes Mystic River into a sullen tone poem.   Eastwood's longtime collaborators also make essential contributions:  Joel Cox's editing is tensely precise, particularly in the film's final third; production designer extraordinaire Henry Bumstead (whose credits, incredibly, include Vertigo, To Kill A Mockingbird, The Sting, and Slaughterhouse-Five) produces a Boston that is palpably real, and closing in on its inhabitants; and composer Lennie Niehaus, who takes second billing to Eastwood for the (mostly) subtle, piano-driven score that hardly ever pushes our buttons.  And we must pay tribute to Brian Helgeland's driven script, his best since his dealings with Curtis Hanson on L.A. Confidential. Working from novelist Dennis Lehane's best-selling source material, he and Eastwood have fleshed out an intimate, tasteful, cynical look at those who let themselves be whisked away and ruined by wickedness, and those follow but refuse to feel bad about it.",

But with Mystic River he's directed a movie reminding us that he was the guy who directed movies such as Bird, Unforgiven or the Bridges of Madison County. Mystic River is not a masterpiece but it's vintage Eastwood and it owes it to two things: the movie is shot with a real sense of what great classic filming is and the screenplay by Brian Helgeland. This screenplay develops lots of intersting themes: the transmission of evil through the links of blood and friendship, the way violence and the desire for revenge is reproducing eternally, the observation of small towns, their rumours, their boredom. The pessimism of the movie towards the part of evil there's in every human being is reminiscent of Fritz Lang. Overall, the tone is very dark but there's some funny moments, especially the cameo of Eli Wallach. But what prevents the movie from equalling Unforgiven is the interpretation of Sean Penn and Tim Robbins which look too much \"trying to make an Actor's studio performance\" and an uneven score. Anyway, it should have won the Best Screenplay award in Cannes rather than horrible \"les Invasions Barbares\". Recommended. 8,5/10",

Maybe a little more... ummm... GUILT from Sean Penn's character Jimmy. The grieving was there over his daughter's death, but how about the guilt that was \"planted\" by the movie? That he knew in some way he had something to do with her death?!?!? We do find out that this is true... that the son of a man he had killed years ago was responsible for his daughter's death, making him ultimately responsible. And to top it off, he ends up killing the wrong guy (Tim Robbins)to boot. Some guilt was expressed... but way too little. I felt like I was watching \"Crimes and Misdemeanors\" minus the Woody Allen humor! So to me the anti-climatic ending of the parade squashed all guilt of the character (and I'm sure that's what Eastwood intended with the story).Clint did a fantastic job directing... there were a few really good haunting scenes like near the end of the movie when Jimmy and Sean (Sean and Kevin) were standing in the middle of the street remembering when David (Tim) was abducted.All the acting was first class all the way...I especially enjoyed Laurence Fishburne's performance.However, all in all I find Mystic River to be a very good but a very unsatisfying picture... and if that's the way it's supposed to leave you it deserves a 10, but until I know that for sure I'm sticking with the 7 I gave it!",

All 3 of them present a different kind of psychology.Sean Penn's personage is cruel,desperately seeking for vengeance,counterstrike of what disarms him;a fighter,a criminal,but a good one-self-defense and defense of his family leading to a similar attitude take the charges off him;provocation defines his character;in a word-egoist of a class. Kavin Bacon's great.For once in ages he isn't the bad guy!His character is composed,the most sensible of all;his judgments are reasonable and balanced.He's the happy one(BTW the only one who's happy)at the end. Dave Boyle,the third,actually kills himself or to tell it right-gets himself killed.Weakness,paranoia.He is a sinner BTW... Everyone makes it to redemption in the movie-in a mystic way but that's the way of the river's float-it's life. The footprints of the friends are still there,those they left when they were kids,moments before the tragedy curses them.Sometimes a stroke of hazard is good,sometimes fatal like this one,but always extremely marking and mystic!

            "content": "Mystic River is about killers, and not all the human kind. It's also about the things that kill us, little by little, from negligence more than malice: hatred, suspicion, even our personal histories. The first murder victim in this sad, moving film is not a person, but the innocence of a young boy who is abducted by two pedophiles and brutally raped for four days. When he grows up, that boy, Dave Boyle (Tim Robbins, looking like a sack of discarded laundry), is already damaged goods. His childhood best friends have pulled away, themselves tortured by the guilt of allowing him to get in the car who men they believed were police officers. One, Jimmy (Sean Penn) has spent time in prison; the other, Sean (Kevin Bacon, all ghostly and beaten), has achieved outward success as a Massachusetts police detective, but his personal life remains a mess. When Jimmy's daughter is murdered, Jimmy investigates, and Dave begins to look guilty. It is something of a misnomer to refer to the action of the film -- not a lot actually happens during its 140 minute run time, other than the emotional strip-mining of this clannish, woefully misguided Boston community of Catholic street toughs who have never quite matured into full-fledged human beings. The director, Clint Eastwood, seems to be saying few of us are truly evolved, that errors in judgment plague everything we do. Penn and Bacon give fully-realized performances, but Robbins is a walking wound, a laceration that has never scabbed over, so bedeviled as to break your heart. Laura Linney, as Penn's wife, has the steelines of Lady Macbeth, which she is only able to display in her limited screen time (she drops of the face of the earth for a full hour, without explanation). Only Marcia Gay Harden, frequently brilliant as an actress, delivers a poor performance as Celeste, Dave's mousy and annoyingly unsympathetic wife. As usual, Eastwood overdoses on the chiaroscuro lighting, casting every night scene in the half-light of a Caravaggio painting, but that's because he doesn't want you to see everything at once -- life isn't as simple as that. We only catch glimpses, by and large, of the big picture. And if there is a tragic message to Mystic River, it is that a little knowledge is a dangerous thing in the hands of the human animal.",

The raw emotion conveyed by allthe principal characters, and right down to the supporting cast, did this well- scripted story justice.  In my view, the only facet of this movie that kept it from \"perfection\" was the seemingly unrealistic manner in which the Boston Policeseemed to tolerate the vicious treatment of Sean Penn's character's underworld henchmen.

They're one of the best performances in years of film-making, for sure.The story itself and the plot in my opinion at parts is to slow, but now that I think about it, I think it might have been because I was really sleepy and it was late as I can't - analyzing the whole movie - think of one single scene that was either unnecessary or not strong enough. That's directing enough.The story, after the ending makes you sit for a while and think about what you just saw and that's good. It's dark, it's surprising, it's very emotional and believable.

            "content": "I don't know what it is about some films that makes me feel that I live on a different planet from everybody else. Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon was one. Over the top stylised nonsense with a story line that makes Hans Christian Andersen's stories read like nuclear physics. Yet almost everyone thought it a great masterpiece. And now Mystic River.With a cast featuring the acting talents of Tim Robbins, Kevin Bacon, Shaun Penn and Laurence Fishburne you need a major screw up from either the director or screenwriter or both to make this film fail. Nobody screws up that bad, and the movie remains watchable. But it leaves a deeply unsatisfactory feeling in you, almost like you were made to watch a movie that takes itself so seriously that you are compelled to hail it a masterpiece before you even finish watching it, but a great film this ain't.Before I divulge the chief reason why this movie isn't great and was not going to be even before filming began, let me outline the story. Three childhood friends who used to play together grow into adulthood in the same town. Bacon becomes a cop, Penn becomes a store owner, and Robbins' job must have been insignificant because I don't remember what it was. Way back in the past the three kids are playing when one of them is kidnapped by a couple of nasty adults and raped. The abused kid who is imprisoned so that more abuse can be meted out to him by his sick kidnappers escapes after a couple of days, to be forever scarred mentally by the horror of his experience.Back in the present, it does not take long for us to guess who the abused kid is now. Robbins with his uncertain, slow speech, slow reactions whenever someone talks to him has to be the boy who suffered. The three boys are no longer that close, they acknowledge each other when meeting by chance, but it looks like they are still in shock over what happened to Robbins all those years ago and friendship has not developed as a result. This is the way things are when Penn's teenage daughter is found murdered. Being of a benevolent gangster disposition, he does his own investigation parallel to the routine cop investigation headed by Bacon. To cut the circumstantial evidence short, Penn's suspicions become fixed on Robbbins, who has had some unaccountable for blood stains and memory issues on the night Penn's daughter was killed.And now why this movie is not great - it turns out that Robbins rescued a young boy who was being sexually assaulted on the same night Penn's daughter was killed. The struggle left him with the blood, and his unwillingness to explain his whereabouts merely seals his fate as gangster Penn does what he has to do. Let me elaborate further. First we have three young kids who play together. One of them is kidnapped and abused. Second we have the three of them grown up and doing their own thing when one's daughter is murdered. Third we have the now grown up abused boy rescuing a potential victim of sexual assault the same night his childhood friends's daughter was killed. All this in the same town. I well understand the need for dramatic license in movies but this is just pushing it too far. If my point isn't clear yet basically the story is far too coincidental and contrived for this to be anything better than an above average TV movie.The second weakness is Sean Penn. Powerful actor he can be. But here he is hammy, over the top in parts and confusingly introspective. It is an inconsistent performance which affects the film as his is a major role. Bacon does not have a deep enough role for him to shine through. Robbins is very good in his role. Eastwood directs solidly but cannot hide the weaknesses in the story.Again certainly not a bad movie and worth watching for the hype at least.",

My belief is that Americans love murder and violence, or at least love to see it and read about it. That's why we have so much of it in the news, it makes for good entertainment. A soft, warm-hearted film like Lost in Translation will never be considered better next to murder and dementia, regardless of the fact that Bill Murray's performance was better than Sean Penn's. Bill Murray's performance was better because 1) much of it was ad-libbed 2)it was equally as dramatic as Penn's performance, just without the violence, dementia, and mental disease Americans love to see delivered.

            "content": "If a person ever has the misfortune to be stuck in a room with a script writing teacher who bangs on about Aristotle's Poetics and generally tows that line, Mystic River is a film that will be something not forgotten. A perfect Aristotelian tragedy is clearly the kind of film Eastwood wished to make but on a plot level, but nevertheless falls short.The flaws begin with the case of the poorly written wives. The Celeste Boyle character (Marcia Gay Harden) is never properly explored. She all too quickly embodies the audience's suspicions to the point where it has to be asked whether she has only been married to him as long as we have known her. She has no motive to jump to that conclusion so quickly - other than her conscience - and since when is that good enough in a story like this? The audience jumps to that conclusion because we don't know him - she's his wife and the mother of his child. Annabeth Markum (Laura Linney) becomes Lady MacBeth hailing a king in the final act while remaining pretty much absent throughout much of the film including her daughter's wake. Cop Sean Devine's (Kevin Bacon) relationship to his prank caller wife is never explained to any purposeful degree but by the end of the film he's playing happy families with her and a new born baby. Within the main trio of characters, Dave Boyle's reasons for not coming clean about his \"mugging\" are also pretty thin. Sean Devine's (Kevin Bacon) story is also never explored to the point where he serves as a device for tension but not someone whose fate we really care about. Not to mind the fact that at the end of the film he shows up with all the answers, but does nothing to apprehend a killer. Yet somehow is rewarded with domestic bliss. Obviously, moral questions abound about arresting a man and friend whose daughter has just been killed and who has falsely accused and killed one of his oldest friends. Nevertheless, it was Jimmy Markcum's (Sean Penn) character who was arguably the focus of this film. He was the leader of the kids when they wrote in the cement and had Dave Boyle kidnapped and raped. He shows no remorse for this indirect responsibility and carries no guilt - which is perhaps understandable. Nevertheless, it is his actions which set off this tragedy - and it is he who must fall to bring about the true catharsis.We know right from the start of looking at this kid that he is a punk and he will always be a punk. As soon as we know it's his daughter that has died, we know somebody is going to die, and we also know that that somebody is going to be Dave Boyle. The only thing open to question in this film, is Jimmy Marcum's moral journey. He is wound up like a pit bull from the start to the finish, his tragic flaw being his over zealous love for his daughter and his need for revenge and it must be this which brings about his downfall and creates the catharsis of the film. It is his arrest and the total destruction of his family - that fall of the king - which brings about the moral wrenching which we needed to feel the full impact of this story. Instead, we end up with random marching parades, the return of the wife and child of a supporting character for no real dramatic effect, and some funny glances with an open ending. Most of all there is no justice for Marcum which is what this story demands. A Tragedy where the tragic hero doesn't fall. Tragedy's with a happy ending does not a masterpiece make.Nevertheless, it has to be said, the acting here is flawless. What's missing in the perfect Aristotelian or Shakespearian plot is made up for in this powerful cast. It is only when a film is this well crafted that one can see so perfectly just where all it's flaws lie. Clearly this film has worked well enough to get Oscars and garner rave reviews, but it simply isn't the film it should have been.",

The movie is very existentialist  which I actually studied alittle once upon a time in college.  **SPOILERS** You have Dave who makes the \"choice\" to get into the car with the sexual abusers.  They did not force him, he did have a choice.  He becomes a victim.  He marries a woman who ultimately becomes a victim....Again it is her choice!  Why else would the woman who has been married to this man all these years just go on and blab \"my husband is a murderer\".  What did she think would happen considering the history of the \"Savage\" brothers???  Laura Linney's character at the end \"you can take over the town\" she says to her husband, after he has committed murder of a friend who was there for them after the death of their daughter!  It's just too farcical unless you understand the theory of existentialism and this movie showing by example.  Jimmy (Sean Pean) is a criminal by his own choice and indeed continues that choice when he murders Dave. Sean, (James Bacon) is an observer..... He observes Dave, he observed the 911 call, he observed and not participated in his marriage. The PROBLEM I have with the movie, is how jovial Penn and Bacon became at the parade.  I don't think this would have fit from the book.  And if Penn hated the Harris boys so much, why would he send them $500 every month? Wouldn't his wife have insisted he give the money to them?  It just can't be understood by actual human nature, it's unbelievable, but looking at their actions purely philosophically I guess you can appreciate the movie. Existentialism is an interesting belief.  I had a teacher that was a pure existentialist.  It basically says you have the life you have by your choices.  Websters says:  it is a theory which stresses the individual's responsibility for making himself what he is.  Mystic River is an example of this.... it's not just a 2 dimensional story line and in that sense I give it & Eastwood kudos.  Sean Penn was VERY GOOD, however just a few times especially during the murder scene abit too unbelievable.  Everyone else was just great.  I just have a real problem with the ending.  Bacon gives Penn a shoot you gesture?  What the heck is that about.  Again a real problem with the ending.  Any comments?  Guess I'll have to real the book.  8 stars out of 10.  (Sorry Clint, Seabiscuit will win Best Picture by a nose!)",

I'm not saying this kind of thing doesn't happen in life, no it really happens a lot, all i am saying is that a cop that dirty and a man with such crimes are not a man, not a human anymore, we call them \"monsters\". the movie should have shown those character as they really are in true life, not even like a normal person! yet it tries to show a heartless killer and not just any killer, a ruthless killer without any hesitation, and a corrupt cop and all those who back them up, like an angel!!!, even worse, the movie justifies corruption and murderer in the most stupid way! if i was a producer of this movie, i would suggest Clint Eastwood to quit directing films... .",

Life continued on, and each made their way through life separately to this, only to be brought together once agon by another terrible event.

            "content": "Clint Eastwood's \"Mystic River\" is an intelligent mystery with standout performances from the lead players that is solid, grown-up entertainment.The story is simple enough about a young woman found dead, murdered, in a mainly Catholic community but it's the characters and the decisions that they make that make this a griping tale. At over two hours you're not aware at any point of the running time. Brian Helgeland, who wrote Eastwood's last movie \"Blood Work\", has greatly adapted the book on which it is based with fleshed out characters and realistic dialogue. His script certainly washes out that awful taste in your mouth due to his previous work \"The Postman\" and puts him back in the \"L.A. Confidential\" ranks as a top notch scenerist. Sean Penn, who usually steals the show, fights to be noticed this time around up against such brilliant performances from Tim Robbins and Laurence Fishburne. Kevin Bacon gives a more low key performance than usual but due to that allows his fellow actors to shine. Also nice cameo from Eastwood regular Eli Wallach as a liquor store owner. Everything about this film feels and looks authentic from the neighbourhood to the actor's accents. The only problem is the music which seems a little heavy handed at times. It's hard to believe that this is directed by the same Clint Eastwood, the western icon of the late twentieth century. This is an actor's piece and Eastwood delievers thoughtful and true performances from all of his cast. Not up there with \"Unforgiven\" but it certainly comes close.",

            "content": "MYSTIC RIVER is full of excellent performances. Sean Penn resembles Robert DeNiro so much it makes me wonder if some Hollywood fling brought him into the world. Kevin Bacon has matured and for the first time in many years, turns in a performance that is both dark and sympathetic. Marcia Gay Harden plays haunted better than anyone, although we don't see a great deal of range from her in this film.Tim Robbins was perhaps too obvious a choice in his role, but he delivers exactly what JACOB'S LADDER and ARLINGTON ROAD showed he could do before, so the choice can be forgiven. He chews a bit of scenery, but always when it's called for.The film is worth seeing for the acting alone. Eastwood directs like a man in love with his actors and his scenery, employing long takes and two-shots to give the story a sense of real time that is too often eschewed by younger directors in favor of interesting angles. In the end, while this is a great performance showcase, it bogs down a story that holds relatively little suspense, as it lumbers on toward the inevitable horrific conclusion that plays out over perhaps 40 minutes at the end of the film. (It is not unlike that last long, ponderous sentence I wrote. I'm still in the rhythm of the movie.)MYSTIC RIVER is not a police procedural mystery. It is a mystery about human behavior, about these men and their pasts and their relationships with women and their world. It is only about their relationships with one another as those relationships are colored by external events. As such, this is safe territory for a \"guy movie\" that plumbs deep emotion without feeling anything too personal. It's a story about what Real Men dream of doing, and how it feels when the dreams become real.With all this weight, I can't imagine what the composers were thinking while scoring the film. Certainly, of something happier and more uplifting than what played out on the screen. The score was at times so utterly out of place as to be insulting, and I cringed more than once when the refrain played.I can't address any issue in the plot without unraveling the tapestry Helgeland weaves in his screenplay. I can say that this film is full of disturbing moments, sucker-punches, and anguish, and it will not apologize to you after the beating. But sometimes, a beating is worth it for what you take away, even if the lesson is that such a beating is better fantasized than delivered.8/10 for the performances, screenplay and Eastwood's steady hand; points deducted for a too-indulgent pace and the ridiculous score that snapped me right out of the moment a half dozen times and made me grateful for moments of silence.",

If you have not seen the movie yet then don't read on because I am going to list some Spoilors. This movie starts with three kids playing hockey then we see a car pull off they lose there ball and they are going to carve there names. When Dave has DA down a car comes with two cops[ it turns out there not really cops]. So they ask the boys where they live when they get to Dave he lives farther away from the two other kids so they tell him to get in the car and he tells the two other kids to tell there parents what they did. So they took Dave for four days you see him in a room then he escapes running you hear weird sounds. Then it goes to the future we see Jimmy one of the three kids daughter telling her father she would be out that night. He tells her she is suppose to go to her sisters first holly communuion the next day. She goes to this bar that night where Dave is dancing on a poll with her friends. The next day we see Dave covered in blood saying to his wife that he might have killed a guy that tryed to mug him. Jimmys daughter she had not showed up to the communion and she was dropped off somewhere at 1. After we see two dectectives on this case then we find Jimmy was friends Sean. But we see a street crossed off Jimmy sees his little girls car then the cop finds his daughter found dead. Daves wife starts to get suspicious of him because the death occured the same night that he said he might have killed a mugger. When he came home covered in blood little do we know Dave keeps changing his story when asked how he bruised his arm. Ok then we find out Jimmy was in jail, Sean wife calls him and is silent which I think is the best scene so far this year without action, and we find Jimmys daughter was going to go get married to Brandon this guy who Jimmy hates. He passes his pollygraph test. Then we find he had a brother who does sign language who seemed like he didnt't want his brother to leave. We finf out this store manager had this guy Ray harris Brandons father who owned the same gun that was used in the murder. They question him they know he is lying though about the gun. Then daves wife goes to Jimmy tells him she thinks Dave killed his daughter. This sets up one of the best magical move I have seen in film making we see Jimmy and all of his friends take Dave to go eat then they go outside Jimmy tells Dave he knows he killed his daughter then it goes to brandon his brother and his friend. Where Brandon is mad about somthing hes beating up his friend and telling his brother to say he loves him. We find out the two boys sign language kid and his friend killed Jimmys daughter. Which leads up to Jimmy killing Dave because he wounldn't confess he killed his daughter so Daves wife comes back we see everyone at a parade Sean takes his finger like a gun shoots Jimmy pulls up his hands then we see the camera get a river.

Some of the side shows (the cop's wife who calls but doesn't speak to him, Jimmy's wife's reaction to what happens at the end) are plain silly - because we don't know enough about the relationship of the cop and his wife, and we haven't seen enough of the Jimmy wife character (beyond her natural bias towards her own daughters rather than the daughter from a previous marriage) to make the behavior convincing.",

In his own way he's an American auteur. Unfortunately Mystic River is one of his weakest movies ever. **Spoilers**Not only is it painfully slow, but it's painfully cliched. Events are telegraphed miles in advance. Some of the dialogue is awful. Tim Robbins (the best thing in this movie) going on about \"I had to split my personality into somebody else so I could deal with the abuse\" is a great example of bad dialogue. The wonderful Marcia Gay Harden plays her role like a bug-eyed looney from a 1930s Universal horror film. If the usually incredible Sean Penn cried one more time I would have puked. And this is one of those movies that so obviously sets up a killer that you know it can't be that character, and then in the last ten minutes the real killer is discovered. But I have one last complaint. Clint should stick to directing and give up composing. The music is treacle. The crescendo blast of music at the end when a gun is shot and the screen cuts to a bright sunny day was too much. He should stick with Lennie Niehaus.This is similar in many ways to Blood Work and True Crime, where some of the acting is way over the top cliched, and some of the plot twists come either too late or out of left field. Clint is a wonderful director, but like Woody Allen he's been in a slump lately. Let's hope they both recover soon.",

The resolution is as devoid of significance or meaning as the film's pretentious title.The film is only held together Sean Penn's performance. Only he could have held together the somewhat surprising evolution of his character from shopkeeper to Shakespearian monster. If he'd started addressing the camera in iambic pentameters I wouldn't have been surprised. Marcia Gay Harden's twitching, eye-popping turn nearly sinks it though--did she think she was in a horror movie. Bacon's performance as a man with no apparent internal life may, or may not be deliberate.Once again Eastwood serves up a slice of badly-lit gloom, in the (apparently justified) hope that anything downbeat will immediately be hailed as a masterpiece.

I admit, I have no idea what a group of childhood friends from Boston would stay to one another in the circumstances that the film portrays. But in attempting to capture the plight of a torn father, the writing lacks conviction and humanity. The only well written character is Tim Robbins', who seems to convincingly capture a sexually abused child. The film lacks an overall character development for the entire cast and jerks the audience around with what we would believe the personality of Sean Penn's character is. The acting was as good as it could get with the bad script writing. Tim Robbins did a fantastic job, as did Tom Guiry as Brendan Harris. The rest of the cast just had such terribly written scripts that I don't feel they had enough to work with. Laurence Fishburne and the two actors playing the Savage brothers were completely lifeless and uncompelling. And seriously...DEVINE?? I think that Clint Eastwood has acted in too many bad cop movies and a campy name like Devine is something he'd just dive on.And that brings me to my biggest complaint: The directing. Clint Eastwood should stick in front of the camera. I am sorry, he gives no room for the actors to act, he is all about sweeping shots meant to capture some overall \"artistic\" metaphor about the river that aside from the films location and brief mention of its name has NOTHING to do with the story - this story could happen anywhere from Burnaby to Boston to Barcelona.This is the same tripe that Hollywood loves to make - predictable plots, stereotyped characters, supposedly universal themes of family, life and death, and finally, uninspired directing that gets attention purely out of star power.Go and see Lost in Translation if you want to see how humans actually live. See Mystic River if you want to compare something to all the bad jokes about cop movies - which ultimately this is.",

When his oldest daughter, who is from a previous marriage, is killed in a seemingly senseless murder, Penn's character struggles to hold himself together as he reverts back to his gangster-like ways in an attempt to find out who killed his daughter. Penn does an award-winning job of displaying his wide range emotions of his character experiences, from the heart-wrenching ordeal of having to identify her body at a local morgue, to his quest to take revenge on his daughter's killer.An equally compelling performance is delivered by Tim Robbins, who plays Dave Boyle, one of Jimmy Markum's childhood friends and potential suspect in the murder. Robbins elicits a unique blend of suspicion and sympathy from the audience as his character deals not only with the current murder, but with his own personal demons from his youth. Viewers feel sorry for Boyle as the tragic events of both the past and present drag him deeper and deeper into a dark and depressive state, yet still wonder about his true involvement in the murder since you never get the feeling that he's telling the whole story, and occasionally gets caught in small lies.Kevin Bacon offers a strong supporting hand as Sean Devine, another buddy of both Markum and Boyle's, who has made a life as a cop and is called in to investigate the murder. Devine is a dedicated cop who, at times, seems torn between his two friends: Markum, because he needs to bring his daughter's killer to justice, and Boyle, because he doesn't want to believe that this old friend is the young woman's killer. His faith in Boyle sometimes brings him into conflict with his partner, (played by Lawrence Fishburne) who is almost entirely convinced of Boyle's guilt. He's also occasionally distracted from his job by brief, occasional calls from his recently estranged, which give us small, yet interesting glimpses into his own personal struggles.Perhaps the most under-rated acting in this entire cast comes from Marcia Gay Haden, who plays Dave Boyle's wife. Haden plays the character as being confused and at times scared as her husband descends into a state of almost madness. We see her visibly become more and more shaken by his words and actions, eventually to the point where she seems to even question his innocence.Aside from the incredible acting, the movie as a whole is magnificently done. The story is wonderful and compelling, the camera work is fantastic, and the whole film is a winner. People who watch this show will not be able to tear themselves away from it, until the whole tale has been played out and the credits finally roll. It was definitely deserving of the Oscar Awards and nominations it received, and should be considered on of Clint Eastwood's greatest cinematic accomplishments as a director.",

Robbins is one of my favorite actors (Shawshank, Bob Roberts, the Player), I already saw Mystic River, and I did not recall his being in the film -- that's how good his performance was.  With his weight gain, his stooped appearance, his lost and dejected look, and his sadness, he did not look like himself -- and that was not because of make-up.  He really deserves an Oscar.That is the main reason I went to see this film again -- to observe Robbins. My companions for both viewings liked Mystic River, especially the performances of the male actors.  The female actors as the wives were not real.  What's with that silly phone-calling wife?  And Sean/Kevin Bacon allowed her to keep their baby whose name he did not even know!  Jimmy/Sean Penn was excellent.Doesn't every eastern town have a section like that featured in this film? That familiarity was a plus, an easy way to become absorbed deeply in Mystic River.***SPOILER*** And, Kevin Bacon, not all of you got into that car!  No one suffered as much as Davey.  What was the reason for the cross on the ring? Am I correct that the wearer was a you-know?  Didn't the Mystic River area have a hardware store stocked with sandpaper and paint for the characters' houses!",

It was supposed to make me feel that way. This film was not supposed to be about one man consoling himself and finding his daughter's killer, it was supposed to be the real story of a hard nosed man out of Boston, driven solely by revenge to commit whatever acts he felt necessary in order to avenge his daughter's death. The way Lehane drew all his characters and their situation together is remarkable, I don't want to reveal too much. What makes this movie so great, is the fact that Lehane and Eastwood could take a real story and still put a chilling twist and an entertaining plot to it. Not to mention Sean Penn delivers one of the best acting performances I have seen. Everything about his character is so convincing. As a word of warning, nothing about this movie is happy so don't watch it if your looking for a happy-go-lucky drama film. This film gets increasingly depressing as each scene unfolds, but it is such a masterpiece in every way. IF you can stomach it, I recommend watching this film because it will blow you away.",

But it missed for me in capturing the spirit of the book.  Sean Penn was excellent and deserves an Oscar nod; Kevin Bacon, Laura Linney and Marcia Gay Harden also turned in fine work (as did Laurence Fishburne although he had far less to do.)****SPOILER ALERT***My real problem was with Tim Robbins' portrayal of Dave.  In the book, although the character is tormented by his past, on the surface at least at the beginning he seems to have pulled it together enough to get married and have a child.  His disintegration as the result of confronting that past is much more powerful on paper because the reader is in the character's head. While a good actor (which Tim Robbins certainly is most times) can externalize those changes, from the first time the adult Dave appeared onscreen, he appeared burned out and twitchy, so much so that you can't imagine his wife ever marrying him.  Furthermore I don't think the movie did much with the true horrific twist of the book in exploring Dave's motivations to attack the child molester, which made more believable (in the novel) his later failure to save himself in the confrontation with Jimmy (instead accepting blame for something he didn't in fact do).Much of the strength of the movie comes from the original writing.

All I will say on that subject is that Clint Eastwood can really attract talent -- just seeing the fabulous Eli Wallach in a cameo was a delight. And isn't it almost impossible to believe that the same man who \"became\" Jimmy Markum for this movie once played Jeff Spicoli? Just goes to show what a true talent Sean Penn is (btw, Jeff Spicoli was a fine bit of acting).I'm writing this because here we have an intriguing story, a great director, one of the best casts ever assembled, excellent editing and photography . . . and the end result did not satisfy me. Why is that? I think because there was so much ambiguity. I don't require a happy ending to feel satisfied, but I like to have a firm grasp of what it was all about. I mean, everyone can die and the world can be destroyed but if it is done well and makes sense, I'm alright with it. Reading the message boards on this movie confirms that many others were left with lingering questions. Who actually pulled the trigger? Why the 911 call? Was it an accident or intentional? If an accident, why was the body so beat-up? There are just too many conflicting inferences. Kevin Bacon at the end of the film -- the \"gun-click\" with the fingers -- is this supposed to infer something profound? I guess Eastwood wanted to end with ambiguity -- like the real world -- but it is frustrating. This is a very good film and the actor's portrayals are so spectacular that you can overlook this sort of dissatisfaction. Why it was considered Best Picture material I don't really know, though.",

Now that I have, hmm, I think it's good, quite good, but not as fantastic as I was led to believe.Others have raved about Sean Penn's performance, but honestly, to me it looked as if his \"Dead Man Walking\" character got a last-minute reprieve, went back home to Boston and settled down. As others here have said, gee, Sean Penn playing a tough guy, that's a stretch. Kevin Bacon's and Tim Robbin's characters are more interesting. But geez, what's eating these two? Dave Boyle doesn't like cops, even good cops, even cops who used to be his friend. So what happened? Their unsolved dispute, which we never learn anything about, leads to tragic consequences, starting with when Davey doesn't go to the police after he'd been cut. Then Davey's wife clams up too, tragically, before  spilling her heart to the wrong people. Why? The characters never let on, and the director provides no flashbacks.There's more I could complain about, LIKE THE MUSIC THAT CUTS IN LIKE SOME TWIT WITH A BOOMBOX, or compliment, like the way the light falls on Dave's face. Also, I enjoyed Larry Fishburne pushing his partner, and the way Marcia Gay Harden's character contrasted with Laura Linney's. Linney as Sean Penn's wife reminded me of a person who feels safe by keeping a big dog in their yard that menaces the rest of the neighbourhood.But it all comes down to the last scene, when we watch the characters look across at each other as they watch the parade.

It's the tale of three childhood friends - Dave, Jimmy & Sean - & how they & their families become caught up in a cycle of tit for tat violence. Although superficially a murder mystery Mystic River is first & foremost a character study. Those expecting a predominantly plot-driven thriller could end up disappointed.The performances by all concerned are exceptional. The triumvirate of Sean Penn, Tim Robbins & Kevin Bacon deserve all the praise they get but the smaller roles are equally good - amongst them a splendid turn by Eli Wallach (Clint's co-star from The Good, the Bad & the Ugly) as the owner of a liquor store.Clint's direction is exceptional. On the surface it appears low key & unassuming yet nothing could be further from the truth. Eastwood understands that story & character is what counts, not flashy, show-off camera angles just for the sake of it. Like those great directors of old - Michael Curtiz & John Ford amongst them - Clint makes directing look easy & that's the biggest compliment one can pay him.In a story about the way acts of violence affect individuals the only way to break the cycle of violence, the movie suggests, is to start by recognising what you've done. Jimmy starts down this path but is tragically dissuaded from it by his wife who, in a pivotal scene, asserts that their children & his standing in the community is what matters most. It's an uncomfortably believable moment. Only Sean, in a series of one-sided phone calls from his estranged wife finally emerges into the light. The key moment? When he, alone of all the characters, is able to utter to his hurting wife the magic words, 'I'm sorry'.",

A story that engrosses from the start and can let the individual make their own interpretation of a motion picture. Like sculpture or any art form it is lovely to be allowed to form one's opinion without some 'Exec' wanting everybody with views as bland as themselves. Art should encourage debate and Mystic River caused my girlfriend and I to agree on some points and disagree on others. So enjoyable to discuss the more subtle aspects of movie making. Well, back to the movie. What were people thinking giving The Two Towers Oscar for best movie? I think in fairness it was a visual triumph, but does this not have more to do with the availability of CGI rather than the true vision of directing? John Ford and Huston both would have turned in their respective graves. I mention these men as I feel they were true storytellers. Clint Eastwood extracts wonderful performances from all the cast. Both Oscar winners are tremendous and I felt Penn gave a thoughtful, intense performance similar to that of the very underrated 'State Of Grace'. The same compliment can be given to Tim Robbins also and Kevin Bacon impressed as he usually does. Particulary good I thought was Laurence Fishbourne as the cynical cop who gives a beautifully understated performance when less actually means more.

I do give credit to the movie in that it is quite suspenseful, intriguing, and by and large well-acted. The storyline, camera shots, acting, and overall direction of the movie contribute to its suspense, making it rather thrilling. Once the viewer gets into the movie, he or she will surely want to watch it closely till the very end.The acting was impressive, although not Oscar-worthy (i.e. Sean Penn). Penn plays an ex-con, Jimmy, whose daughter has been killed. At times, Penn goes over the top -- his acting is true to life but not as appropriate for the cinema. Tim Robbins was OUTSTANDING. The rest of the supporting cast was good as well.However, the suspense and acting could not save this poor screenplay. I found the story confusing and utterly unbelievable. The writer appears to have tried to cram too much story into 138 minutes. The movie tries to tell too much of everybody's past -- good writing could have shortened the movie by a solid 45 minutes and made it even more gripping. Countless plot twists ultimately diminish the effect of suspense and irony. At times, the dialogue is bland, and the initially dynamic characters regress into hackneyed caricatures.A movie that starts strong but truly falls apart -- 4/10.",

Confidential\". I was more than able to put up with the little plot holes that so many comments have been quick to point out, until the very end. After a long afternoon of drinking with the Savage boys, and drinking alone all night on the street, Jimmy (Sean Penn), seemed quite sober after confessing to his wife, then making-out with her on the bed. I think the last thing any human would consider doing after what he had just gone through was making love. I also wondered why we never saw the face of Sean's(Kevin Bacon) wife until she finally spoke at the end. I thought it would turn out to be Beth, because I wasn't sure if Sean and Beth (as Jimmy's wife) ever had a scene together. It was a little odd that she was a part of the movie at all. I most certainly agree with most of the comments that this was an all-around great cast, and that Tim Robbins was as much deserving of Oscar honors as was Sean Penn.",

She never touched my heart. But she reached me in this movie, powerfully. I felt every moment of Celeste's confusion, dread & guilt. Her desperate search in the parade audience at the end, and the tortured look she gives the smug Linney, standing there smiling with her children & the husband who destroyed Celeste's life, were as moving and appalling as anything in the film.Linney is equally fine. She has a fraction of the on-screen time as Harden, but she makes the last ten minutes of the film astonishing. In that brief time, she becomes an archetype, the Gorgon Guarding Her Home.  Her speech to the troubled Jimmy, assuring him that his murder of the innocent Dave was a noble act, is remarkable.  She is worse than the evildoer, who feels guilt for his crime: she makes his evil acceptable, in fact honorable. She soothes and convinces him in primal fashion, through sex and his belief in himself as a man. And when, at the end, Celeste looks at her in anguish, her responding look says, `Yes, my husband did destroy your family, to do what he had to do as a man & father. Yes, I know the agony this has caused you. And I have no sympathy.' She is amorality incarnate. Linney's speech, & the look she & Harden exchange, are key to the conclusion of the story. Evil hatches more evil. There is no justice, only suffering. In conveying this message, the plotline for the women is as significant as that for the men. And we're fortunate to see it so effectively served by such superior actresses.",

            "content": "It's a long way from Rawhide to the Mystic River in Boston, but director Clint Eastwood makes the transition in style.  This is not a 'nice' film, and consequently I find myself automatically grading it out of 9 instead of 10.  There are liberal sprinklings of graphic violence and language, neither of which, as we know from experience, need to exist to result in a first-rate drama. The drawcard here, though, is the acting performances, particularly that of Sean Penn.  It should be an award-winning effort, as he carries the role of Jimmy Markham, 'reformed' crook, now family man, to perfection.  There are some very adequate support roles portrayed also, notable Tim Robbins as Dave. The story begins some 25 years earlier, with the abduction and maltreatment of one of three young boys while innocently playing in the street.  Any one of them could have been the victim, a fact which returns to haunt them all individually in the years to come.  In later life, with the disappearance of the daughter of one of the three, we are drawn into what proves to be a gruesome murder trail.  Along that trail, the three are reunited by circumstance, reigniting their recollection of the earlier kidnapping incident.  Eventually, some police ballistics evidence leads us to the correct solution, but not before a false accusation has resulted in one unfortunate suspect being summarily dealt with.                          Although Mystic River is longer than the average film, the viewer will remain totally engaged - a testimony to Eastwood's ability to claim, and retain, our attention for the duration.  We are even told in the credits that he composed the original music in the film - I wish I had paid more attention to that at the time.  With acting of this calibre, a rating of at least 8 out of 10 is warranted.",

There is no justice. To begin with the acting was \"made for tv movie\" bad, with the exception (and I do say this with deep regret)of Sean Penn. As much as I despise him, he gave a powerful performance. As for the rest of the cast, they should be ashamed of themselves. Laura Linney did a great New York accent despite the Boston setting. Tim Robbins sounded like he was just trying too hard, there by way over doing it. Kevin Bacon sounded alright the three or four times he actually tried to sound like a Bostonian. Larry Fishburne at least didn't even make an attempt. The rest of the cast were so bland they faded from memory quickly. SPOILER!!!Thanks go out to the kid from GLADIATOR for playing a mute, so we didn't have to suffer his talents as well. The direction of MYSTIC was a bit standard, and it did drag at times but it was nothing to really down mouth. Also Clint is a living legend so as bad as a whole the film was, had he not been behind the camera it could have been even worse. Let's just forgive, and hope he never does it again. As for the story...well, I guess bad books make REALLY bad movies. It was dull dreary none of the characters were likable, and it could have ended several times before it FINALLY did. By the end of this calamity I didn't so much want my money back as the two wasted hours I'd spent sitting with my butt going numb in the theater.

The script is convoluted and filled with details merely designed to confuse the viewer (see also the jumbled Conspiracy Theory for this problem) and the direction was solid, but too focused on everyone being 'tough guys'. There's this great setup of a story and a brilliant opportunity to give us a meditation of the friendship of three leads and the impact that a brutal crime can have on families. Instead, we are treated to a well-acted murder mystery where everyone method acts their asses off. In the end, Tim Robbins steals the movie and deserves his Oscar-Sean Penn (far better in 21 Grams) channels Robert DeNiro and left me saying that Bill Murray should have won the Oscar for 'Lost In Translation' .",

Probably the most emotionally drenching film this side of Unforgiven. After Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, Eastwood seemed to have made less personal movies. But with Mystic River he's directed a movie reminding us that he was the guy who directed movies such as Bird, Unforgiven or the Bridges of Madison County. Mystic River is not a masterpiece but it's vintage Eastwood and it owes it to two things: the movie is shot with a real sense of what great classic filming is and the screenplay by Brian Helgeland. This screenplay develops lots of intersting themes: the transmission of evil through the links of blood and friendship, the way violence and the desire for revenge is reproducing eternally, the observation of small towns, their rumours, their boredom. The pessimism of the movie towards the part of evil there's in every human being is reminiscent of Fritz Lang.

            "content": "Clint Eastwood's latest film, Mystic River, is a classic murder mystery with a contemporary twist set in the gritty working-class streets of Irish South Boston. The characters too are simple people, but with complex, deeply repressed emotional lives. The film represents Eastwood in top form. He captures all the tension and mystery of the classic whodunit, while adding a complex overlayer of psychological repression, crippling emotion and contemporary social issues like child abuse.The performances by the cast are each extraordinary in their way. Even the wives of the lead actors, whose roles are less central to the action, lend the film a great deal of its mysterious, magnetic power. Laura Linney, with perhaps the smallest role of the main characters has an extraordinary Lady Macbeth-like monologue with Sean Penn's character in which she both goads and cajoles him into denying any sense of guilt for the crime he has committed, while at the same time exhorting him to take his rightful place as \"king\" of the neighborhood. She oozes both seduction and evil as she whispers sensuously and insidiously into his ear as they lie supine in their bed.Marcia Gay Harden too has a wonderful scene in which she attempts to confront Tim Robbins, her husband, about a crime she suspects him of committing. As Robbins explains himself unconvincingly, the look of silent desperation, disbelief, and revulsion on Harden's face is priceless and the mark of great acting.Sean Penn, Tim Robbins and Kevin Bacon, who play boyhood pals who witness a horrifying act of kidnapping and sexual abuse, each give commanding performances.Tim Robbins at the bar on the fateful night Many reviewers, including Charlie Rose, noted the amazing physical and emotional transformation that Tim Robbins engineered for his character. Here a 6 foot 4 inch actor slumps his shoulders, shuffles his gait, and slows his speech to become the adult lost soul that his character is (after being abused as a small child) has become.Penn's character is pivotal to the action. He is a man who acts as if he's sure of himself and everything in his world. He basks in friends and family--especially his teenage daughter--and is a mini-Godfather in his community. From his convenience store, he seems to control a small empire. But his life is actually much more complicated and full of self-doubt. His first wife died of cancer while he was in prison. He put himself there because he would not 'rat' on the crime's real perpetrators. Externally, he has everything in life; internally he profoundly doubts himself and the life he has led.Grieving Sean Penn restrained by policemenThe film's plotting is masterfully misdirected. For part of the film, you're led to believe that a teen aged boy committed the murder around which the major action swirls. Then suspicion falls on a lead character. It is this suspicion which traps Penn's character into a fateful act of vengeance that wreaks profound tragedy on all the other characters.If you have not yet seen this film, PLEASE DO NOT READ BEYOND THIS POINT as I will give away some crucial plot points.Notwithstanding everything good about this film, there were a few plot points which I found unconvincing:1. I could not believe that a 12-year old deaf boy could or would shoot a teenage girl with a gun.2. I did not believe that Marcia Gay Harden's character would essentially inform on her husband, conveying her suspicions about his guilt to the father of the murder victim (thereby ensuring her own husband's death).3. I did not understand the ending in which the two surviving main characters enjoy a community parade with their families. Was this Eastwood saying that they have made a pact with each other to bury the crime and move on with their lives? Is Tim Robbins' character the sacrificial lamb whose death allows the sins of all the other characters to be forgiven? If so, this is not explained and remains too obscure for the viewer to understand.4. Why would Kevin Bacon's character, an upstanding State police officer, knowingly allow a guilty man to walk the streets and remain free?5. Why, after promising one of the main characters his life if he confessed to an alleged crime would Sean Penn's character have reneged on his promise and exacted the ultimate revenge?Despite these plot weaknesses, I thought Mystic River was a masterful film and fully deserving of winning the Oscar.",

This is my second favorite Clint film, next to \"Unforgiven.\" The film, like most Clint films, embraces the consequences of violence and crime. It also focuses on people with regrettable past and just wish that they could forget about it, but they can't. The cast is flat-out incredible (except for Laura Linney, who I thought could have done better). Sean Penn and Tim Robbins provide convincing, uncompromising characters. Kevin Bacon, as always, does just as well. The only negative to this wonderful mystery thriller is certain unbelievable characters such as the Savage brothers. That, however, is not really JUST my place to decide. Still, I believe this should have been the Best Picture winner in place of LOTR 3. Don't get me wrong the Return of the King was fantastic, but it still didn't top this. Many people seem to complain about the ending and all I can say (because I don't want to give away anything) is that it would have been almost betrayal for Sean Devine (Kevin Bacon) to act against Jimmy Markum (Sean Penn) for what he did (in his own mind). Also Devine implied he would eventually \"get\" Markum. I just wanted to stop the naysayers here and now.

Have a real, total thought, a courageous heart, and some genuine emotion, would be my advice to this group.  Of course it is risky to expose yourself emotionally in a world chock full of haters, morons and thieves, but what is the alternative? Being like them?  I'd rather not.  I refuse to be like them in excessively praising this rather mediocre effort. Sure, it tries to hit some emotional issues, and does some of that well, but far too much of the movie is uninteresting, uninspired and weak. The title of my review basically sums up my opinion.  As for blame, in addition to the writer, I put it on Eastwood.  For a great screen rebel, he sure has gotten average and timid as a director.  But then again,  maybe he was always afraid to really show himself. I would see this movie again.  I will give it that.  But mainly because I want to see if it could--hopefully--be better the second time around. Right now, if one were to compare this to Good Will Hunting, for example, Mystic River would be embarrassed.**Possible Spoilers** Yes, along with the tortured Robbins, Penn is great, Linney is great, and their daughters are beautiful.  I also like the general idea of Penn's strength, and the way he conveys it (though his dignity and character are questionable, and certainly not fully presented).  The other players are a mixed bag, the kid who played Brendan Harris (who delivers one of the best-filmed--and deserving--screen beatings ever) and Kevin Bacon being positive standouts.  Oh, and where did Linney's Lady MacBeth stuff come from at the end?  Or was that just this movie's self-satisfied version of \"Stand By Your Man?\" Lazy.  **End of spoilers**Bottom line, not a truly great movie because the actors weren't given enough to work with from the writer and director.    Clint, go back to acting in something manly and either get better and stronger fast or stop directing anything but Westerns.",

The only reason I wasn't totally outraged that I paid $10 to see the movie was Tim Robbins' great understated performance.

The violence went on too long in several scenes, with the death of Dave being the most unbearable for length. This could have been a great movie with a better direction.",

The only actors that give a believable performance in the movie are Bacon and Fishburn -- that's because they had the least dialogue to work with.All the others do their best, but it's hard to be impressed with an actor's performance when he's saying and doing ridiculous and illogical things.I could go on and on with listing the flaws in this movie, but it's better if you see it for yourself. Just watch the second to last scene of the movie, where the main character's wife talks to the main character -- try not to throw up.The funny thing is, I would still recommend for you to watch this movie.

Wicker Man is a classic example of this. The movie builds up to what seems to be an amazing climax but instead ends without much effort. The end of a movie to me describes the intentions of the director which in this case is to make you contemplate humanity instead of be entertaining. I have no qualm with the idea of making you contemplate humanity but to base an entire movie on that idea is ridiculous, unless its entertaining as hell. Which in order to do that Eastwood should have made a brilliant ending. Instead he took the road less traveled and thought \"Let's mix it up a bit\" and made it a terrible open end, which many other directors have tried to do and thats really not the best way to end a performance.

Kevin Bacon comes off a little flat, but the supporting roles - including Marcia Gay Harden, Laurence Fishburne, Laura Linney, and Tom Guiry are all very well executed.Some commenters have criticized the direction for being slow, but they are mistaking deliberate pacing with dawdling. This isn't an action movie and should not be directed and edited as such. The film proceeds exactly as it should given its nature.

The end didn't have a punch. This is probably because it seemed as though Clint couldn't end the film.  It just kept going to some misplaced scenes and thrown in storylines. The acting is very good, Penn and Bacon especially, but good acting doesn't mean a good movie. On paper, the plot line seems very good, but in the movie it just isn't that engaging.

Sean Penn gets my vote for overacting award of the year. Some were giggling during his so-called dramatic moments. But the film's biggest problem is its overall message: that humanity stops after being sexually assaulted and that murdering these victims is warranted - or should have no consequences.

I figured out who killed this girl even before midway through the movie, but thought it still could be worth watching. The ending is just such a let down. It doesn't make sense for a variety of reasons. Who killed her makes sense, but the why is stupid. Then the fact that Jimmy takes matters into his own hands just doesn't make sense since he has two remaining daughters to think about and from his comments in the movie, you'd think he wouldn't want to be separated from them.

But hasn't Kevin Bacon covered this material before in \"Sleepers\"?Yes, the acting is pretty good (a little over the top sometimes, so I refrain from using terms such as superb, terrific or wonderful). Penn, as always turns in a great performance, but the Tim Robbins character is insufficiently flawed and our cops Bacon and Fishburne are just a little too self-centered, slick, over-confident and arrogant.Yes the cinematography has been well executed; most of the scenes have a dull grey dreariness about them and we can understand why some might want to escape this existence. But here are a few problems:1) I'm going out on a limb here \u0096 but where's the character development? At what point did the boy's friendship disintegrate. Was it immediately after `the incident'? Why did Sean Devine become a cop? How long has he worked with Whitey Powers? If Dave Boyle is such a `basket case' how did he make it through his teenage years and early adult-hood and what effect has it had upon his marriage? Sure we got a fair amount of history around Penn's character, but what about the others? And don't get me started on the wives. We learn very little about them until we're into the final 10 minutes.\n*** MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD ***2) There is no great revelation or pivotal point in the story. I was waiting and hoping for one but it never came. In fact the story ran out of steam at the end with a rather pitiful explanation for the girl's death (hmm: accidental shooting followed by beating to death with hockey stick) that suggested perhaps the producers, even Eastwood, had either run out of money or enthusiasm.3) Far too many coincidences: cop from across town covers the murder of the daughter of his old buddy, daughter just about to leave town, Dave Boyle attacks someone else on the SAME NIGHT, Dave Boyle gets bumped off the same night cops determine the real killers, cop's wife talks on the day cop supposedly wraps up the case \u0096 this is just ridiculous.4) Brendan Harris saying to his brother `say that you love me' \u0096 what was that all about?5) As has been referenced several times here already - Annabeth Markum saying to her husband, towards the end `you could be king\u0085' etc. \u0096 oh so she thinks it's OK to bump off the wrong guy!6) Sean Devine, our friendly neighborhood cop, not even caring that Jimmy Markum practically admitted to bumping off poor old Dave Boyle. But then, what's that look across the street during the parade all about? Was that supposed to MEAN something?7) Dave Boyle choosing to tell his wife he attacked a mugger rather than a pervert \u0096 why not just tell her the truth?Of course in the end one could accept many of these flaws as simply a story based on realism: life is full of subtle complications, there is no black and white, coincidences do occur and even murder can be boring. But if somebody is going to make a film in this fashion then you have to give the audience something \u0096 and here it seems, the audience was just not given enough. Mr Eastwood and Mr. Penn, in the incredibly unlikely event that you should ever end up reading this please, please ensure you have a good story or screenplay to work from next time.",

Mystic River's biggest flaw is the way previously unimportant characters are thrust into the spotlight and character traits before previously explored are given full attention. What I am about to say may be a spoiler of sorts if the reader has not already seen the movie, so avert your eyes quickly (like now)so as to not be deprived of full enjoyement of the aforementioned movie. Okay, so as I was saying, I think Eastwood and Brian Helgeland probably wanted to give those watching the movie the sense that an invisible, but omnipresent, wall had developed between Sean(Bacon) and Jimmy(Penn), and David(Robbins). When David was taken away at the beginning of the movie, his life and the lives of the other two boys, began to take on two very different paths. I believe the filmakers were trying to show that division still existed even to the point of Sean protecting Jimmy even after he took David's life without reason. As Jimmy's wife(Laura Linney) put it, Sean and Jimmy were \"kings\" of their world, able to protect what is theirs at all costs. David, due to his unfortunate encounter as a child, was devoid of the power that Sean and Jimmy assumed. The closing seen seemed to enhance this feeling, as Sean's and Jimmy's families are seen together, whole and joyous. David's, on-the-other-hand, is left fatherless and lost. Unfortunately, this theme is barely hinted at until the closing scenes. My guess is the novel is more focused when it comes to this theme, because it seems to be the driving force behind the entire story. The movie forsakes that theme until the end, in order to tell a murder mystery.   Therefore, the movie is a very good murder mystery, with a few excellent dramatic moments. The acting, of course, is paramount. Any movie that names Sean Penn, Kevin Bacon, Tim Robbins, Laurence Fishbure, and Laura Linney is sure to include top-notch acting. Penn will probally win the Best Actor award, and justly so. I haven't seen better acting by a male lead in the year past. Bacon or Robbins could have recieved nominations. Robbins character is more pronounced, therefore got the nod. Yet, Bacon's sympathetic, yet powerful acting is great in its subtlety. Marica Gay Harden's portrayal is heart-breaking as an unwitting bystander in the drama between the three men, and Tom Guiry delivers a breakout performance as the boyfriend. Clint Eastwood is overrated as a director. His direction is merely what every novice director would do. The flashbacks, pans towards the sky, and over-head shots are stat-quo for the scenes in which they are used.     The great acting brings this movie to life. Without it, it would be average. With it, I would give it a 7 out of 10. Unfortunately, I haven't seen the other Oscar nominated movie's this year, so this is the best movie I have seen this year. I hope this is not the case.",

Simply put, the movie does not make an adequate case for its underlying premise that the cycle of destructive behavior presented here all stems from the initial abduction of Tim Robbins' character. Defenders of \"Mystic River\" claim that the film's conclusion works because its point is to depict a tragic cycle: Robbins' abduction touched off a cycle of dysfunction that infected several lives, causing Sean Penn to detour through a life of crime that would itself set in motion forces that would: (a) kill Penn's daughter; and (b) cause Penn to kill Robbins under the mistaken impression that Robbins' was responsible for his daughter's death. This \"cycle of pain\" concept is made explicit by Penn's remark to Kevin Bacon near the end of the film: \"Sometimes I feel like we all got into that car.\"Here's the problem, however. There is an absence of convincing proof that what happened to Robbins as a child actually caused any of the lifestyle choices Penn made years later. I just don't buy that Penn turned to a life of crime (and hence committed the murder that would orphan the boy who would kill Penn's daughter) because a boyhood friend of his was kidnapped and abused. There's just nothing in the movie to really link one occurrence to the other. As a matter of fact, in the opening scene, the kid who plays Penn's character as a boy actually seems very much like he's already destined to have problems with the law. In his brief few minutes on the screen, he exudes a wrong-headed and causeless rebelliousness. It makes you think his ship sailed before the movie even began. He's a punk through and through. Robbins' kidnapping doesn't have anything to do with it.Consequently, after Penn has murdered Robbins, I just don't buy, and am somewhat irritated by, his comment that \"sometimes I feel like we all got into that car years ago.\" I'm inclined to answer: \"Well, you didn't. Only one of you got in that car, and endured that abuse, and you just murdered him. Nice going.\" Really, Penn is letting himself off the hook.Apart from the missing causal link between Robbins' abduction and what follows, which is a rather fundamental problem, the third act of the film is badly handled in some other respects. For instance, Penn's costuming during the last half hour is silly. Suddenly he's all decked out from head to toe in black leather, in a display of cartoonish villainy to match his sudden revelation to the audience as a dangerous criminal. Earlier in the film, we sympathized with this character very deeply as he wailed when learning that his daughter had died. By this point, he's acting like a James Bond nemises. It's such a bad directing choice by Eastwood.Also, Laura Linney's big monologue in the bedroom near the end is one of the most stupid, incongruous scenes I've ever seen jammed into a movie. Up to this point, she has been a relatively straight forward blue collar housewife. Suddenly she's Lady MacBeth, telling her man that he's a \"prince\" and he could be \"running this city.\" It is completely out of left field. What is the point of this scene? In what way does it advance the \"tragic cycle of pain\" theory that fans of this movie cling to as evidence that it has a point? One gets the impression that the screenwriter simply wanted to make a reference to Shakespeare to add a little artistic cred to his product. It is inexcusably bad writing to shoehorn it into the final minutes of a movie to which it bears absolutely no thematic relationship.\"Mystic River\" is not an out-and-out bad movie. The performances are strong, and certain individual scenes are powerful (like the aforementioned scene in which Penn discovers his daughter's death), but it suffers so much from it weak points that I think it ultimately weighs in at B- level.",

I hate when people are just going to say they hate this person for some reason or other.  SO WHAT.  The guy is good, he can act good, and he has a good acting career.As for people who hate the ending, I mean in a good way Tim Robbins should of died, after all he did kill the guy after all that time.  He was going through misery as it is for what happeaned to him in the past and by the looks of the ending he was just trying to not live because he was unhappy for what he did.  After all his last words of why he did it sounded like it was a confession to Sean's daughter because he never said anything about the guy.  Minus when Sean Penn was trying to confess, but if you watch the movie again, you can see when Sean Penn asked him why he did it there was no mention to the guy.Anyways I think the movie, was great, I cried a little and even still cried on the way home, because I thought that was a powerful movie.  As for Sean Penn I do admit that his performance was not as good, as the last movie he was nominated for.  I would of expected the perfect performance like I felt with I am Sam, but the magic wasn't as powerful as I am Sam.  I was so happy for Sean Penn to win, but I was like what the hell was I thinking. I didn't care much with Tim Robbins when he won, but after seeing the movie I felt his performance was even better than Sean's.  I loved it being creeped out with him, and thinking he was the killer, but I knew in my heart that this was too easy to be the killer, because that would just ruin the movie.I think that Sean Penn did well, and I give him an A-, but not a perfect score.  I will give this movie, a 10 because that is the first movie I cried even outside the theater.SANDRA",

So I get home and look here on IMDB, and who is listed as composer?Clint Eastwood himself.Well that explains it. Vanity does not work in film score composition. I see that Clint has scored other films, but this one is horrid. This atmosphere of this film would have been much better served with Thomas Newman or Patrick Doyle, even Jerry Goldsmith.

Instead, Clint Eastwood stretches what is really a fairly simple case of some not too bright people dealing unsuccessfully with a fairly implausible coincidence to epic lengths filled with soul searching speeches such as one heard in socially conscious plays of the 1950s, before they were dropped for shorter, snappier, more realistic dialogue. So many scenes rang false in this film - in how many working class bars do a group of young, attractive women perform for the middle aged married men by dancing on the bar? Or what in heavan's name did the fact that the Detective's wife called him up and remained silent have to do with anything? Most annoying was the sheer pretentiousness - the fact that the director seems more interested in pounding it into our consciousness that this is a work of Shakespearean or Homeric Tragedy that we are watching, rather than getting on with telling his not particularly clever story? Unfortunately, this seems to be a fairly risk free of winning critical acclaim nowadays, as witness the fawning attention paid upon the laughably silly American Beauty or ponderously dull Road to Perdition. Pity Clint Eastwood didn't review his own early work in spaghetti westerns. Never a wasted word or a moment, the polar opposite of Mystic River.",

However, one can confidently count on a harrowing drama, bent fates of heroes, high quality acting and tragic happy ending. Recognizable and unchanging Eastwood's style.\u00abMystic River\u00bb - is exception. It is one more harsh and thorny drama with the deeply tragic storyline with the broken and tragic character's fates, involved in its center. Clint Eastwood, like the all- seeing and understanding wise man, learning the life and all of it's, even the most inaccessible and unbelievably cruel sides, he opens to us the most dramatic, the most hysterical and acute-social life scenarios through his cinema works. He with peculiar to him filigree psychological thoroughness, demonstrates to the audience the multifaceted gallery of human images, characters, vices and passions. Using the most intricate and diverse circumstances and moves, he, like an experienced and talented grandmaster, makes these human figures fancifully move on the life's chessboard, provoking it's inevitable and sometimes fatal interactions and collision. Each Eastwood's Director's work is a good faith and underlying psycho-sociological survey of human nature's demonstration.\u00abMystic River\u00bb - this is another variation on a burning and very touching literature's and cinema's theme: the revenge of desperate, suffocating with rage and sorrow parents for their children death. But Clint Eastwood \u2013 is a wise, extraordinarily deep and versatile director, whose movies is rarely reveal only one issue. \u00abMystic River\u00bb is a cruel drama about family values, friendship, and that only one raving impulse, based on too obvious conclusion, is able to trigger the irreversible act, which will tragically change the lives of several people. This is another cautionary tale from the wise man. The story about three 40- years \u00abkids\u00bb, whose ways of life are tragically separated in one moment to be crossed 30 years later under more tragic circumstances. True to himself, Clint Eastwood will never spare the audience. At first, he will achieve from us the sympathy or aching pity to his characters in all possible ways, after that will ruthlessly and cruelly crush them by all imaginable and unimaginable in its cruelty life cataclysms, and particularly poor and downtrodden by life heroes he'll kill at all. Almost like Dostoevsky. There is no need to retell the plot of the movie. This film is necessary to watch, to form our own opinion. The psychological tension will keep us from the very first frames. But you shouldn't expect from the Eastwood's movie extremely topical action and ingenious intrigue this time. It's a detective drama, not without strings and twisted confluence of the plot, but the narrative's focus is aimed at three deformed and unfortunate fate of the main characters, their loneliness, their pain, their regret. Acting of Eastwood's films traditionally impresses with its deep anguish, powerful and heavy influence and drama. Certainly, it is impossible not to note the performers of the main roles, received the Oscars for the \u00abBest Actor in a Leading Role\u00bb and \u00abthe Best Actor in a Supporting Role\u00bb - Sean Penn and Tim Robbins. This are not entirely new and unexpected actors images, but, nevertheless, brilliantly and plausibly expressed. Sean Penn - in the traditional image of revolting gusty criminal \u00abelement\u00bb, who imagines himself a punishing finger. Tim Robbins, at first sight, reconciled and a diligent prisoner, with a day by day looming intention to be heard and understood. And Kevin Bacon, rushing between them, made the difficult choice between professional duty in favor of the former friendship. Each of them once sat in his car and left in an unknown direction, towards their own destiny\u0085Once again, the wise \u00abold fox\u00bb Clint Eastwood allocated responsibilities the viewer for the verdict of the main characters actions. Once again he palmed off to us what kind of obvious, but at the same time, ambiguous ending. Clint Eastwood's movies - are not only ready instructive, full of wisdom and life lessons, stories. It they provide us with an opportunity to deal in the web of the human soul and essence, not limiting our perception imposed images and standards.",

            "content": "The idea of this movie is fantastic. Three young boys meet again in adulthood when one of their daughters is murdered - one is the father, one is the detective, and one is the suspect, this film had all the makings of a great crime thriller. Sean Penn is thoroughly convincing as Jimmy and his scenes certainly stir up the greatest emotions, particularly the harrowing scene near the end with Robbins, on the shores of the \"Mystic River\". Bacon is typically good, not outstanding, but he does a good enough job. Laurence Fishbourne was rather wasted in this movie, i couldnt help thinking his part could have been played by any actor of semi-good calibre - it's hard to not think of him in his Matrix role. This movie had a lot to offer, and some good plot twists which you could only really predict near the end, but for some reason it seemed to drag - I put this down to the director. Eastwood seems to always go for the intense facial shots and never allow a moment to relax and prepare for the tension to come - it certainly wasn't the movie to take popcorn into! The tension was superbly done in the big scenes with the lead actors, particularly when Penn finds out his daughter is dead, but i felt a little more variation in tension would have made the film easier to watch. I struggle to think of the point the movie was trying to make. Here's my shot: it was saying that a man will do what he has to in order to protect his family, and this is the way they are brought up - hence the slightly disturbing conversation between Jimmy and his wife at the end. A slightly weak point to make in my opinion, and certainly one that you would not want to encourage. You leave the theatre feeling dissatisfied at the injustice of the movie. All that should not take away from the fact that it was certainly worth a watch, and it is a great plot, with some fine acting performances.",

            "content": "I stayed with this film for it's length but ultimately it left me disappointed ******** SPOILER ******** Dave - a child abuse victim - abducted as a child - comes home at 3.00am one morning covered in blood, his and someone else's. He concocts a story that he was mugged and may have killed his mugger. His wife offers to deal with his clothes and cover up for him... She's a good wife. She understands it was self defense.But the truth is that Dave actually spotted a Paedophile with a young boy... Pulled him out of the car getting physical... and was then attacked by the pedophile with a knife... Dave beats him to death. The truth is actually more understandable given his history... So why did he lie to his wife and why does he throughout the film allow this lie to continue? Even when his wife and others then suspect he has killed a friend's daughter.Psychologically one might argue that the abuse victim hated himself so much that he could not admit the truth. One suspects that in the book we might know what Dave was doing in the area at that time. Was it a known haunt for men to pick up boys? Was he horrifically fascinated by such acts and therefore felt he deserved to suffer? Victims often feel responsible for the crimes committed against them.... But no... That's too deep. He didn't tell his wife the truth because there was over two hours of movie to go through. And if he told her the truth we wouldn't be able to suspect him of being twisted enough to kill his friends daughter... Who coincidentally gets murdered the same night.And this is how the film is constructed... The reveals must happen in dramatic order therefore we cannot have the characters behaving believably otherwise it might upset the order of the reveal. So Dave can lose everything - his son - his wife - his life... He's damaged goods so who cares? No need to explain.The police can ignore evidence and procedure... because they too must play the game of suspecting the wrong people at first. And then finding out that the girl's death was - once again - purely coincidental. At least this is what the father is told. Although a long scene where the dead girl's boyfriend accuses his brother of doing it because he was jealous of his brothers love for her is played out before and at least has some sense to it... But it actually seems to be the mute brothers friend who may have pulled the trigger since he has the gun which was used by the brothers father in an unsolved robbery in 1982. Confused? Never mind... we'll have some long lingering close ups of an emoting Sean Penn and it will all make sense in the end. And we'll be so stunned by the acting that we won't need to worry about little things like the plot making sense.For me Kevin Bacon's performance was the only truthful one... But then his character got saddled with a subplot that was so thin no one bothered to let us know what it was... Wife/ partner has run off to NY and phone's him everyday but says nothing. We don't know how long this has gone on for... But at the end of the film she calls... he says sorry, she says sorry and they are reunited along with their baby daughter in time to watch a parade and play happy families???? We are also treated to a Lady Macbeth style speech by Jimmy's second wife late on in the film that was probably very significant in the book but because we have only seen her fleetingly throughout the movie has no impact.All in all shoddy lazy work.",

It is all the more regrettable that I say this because the individual elements of the movie are all so good. Clint Eastwood hits a home run as director, giving us his best work since Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, and probably since Unforgiven. This film demonstrates a particular gift he has for probing the darkest depths of man and exposing what he will do when pushed too far. His style is simple and elegant, and his ethic uncompromising. You won't see a better ensemble this year than the one lined up for this picture. Sean Penn gives the performance of his life, one that certainly should not be overloked at the Oscars next March. Tim Robbins's performance is his best since Shawshank. The emotional fragility and coldness of his character and the delicate balance between hate and misery he feels are utterly real and unrelentingly harsh. Marcia Gay Harden is also stellar, far outdoing her Oscar-winning role in Pollack.Brian Helgeland's script is also excellent, and his dialogue poetic, though I think that some of the rawness of Dennis Lehane's novel was compromised in the transition. This may be where it went a little awry for me, as I felt the nagging feeling that I wanted it to challenge me more, that I wanted it to be more brutal, more unforgiving, more REAL. And I say this while completely recognizing the fact that Clint Eastwood has made an excellent film. The film is difficult to take the whole way through, and as in real life a lot of the time, the characters find no easy answers to their questions. Mystic River does not go easily, but I would not have minded if it had gone even less so. 8/10",

Robbins gives the stronger performance, but it's so good it's boring. Yes he nails the accent, and the mental state etc etc. I've seen that same sort of brilliant performance from countless other actors over the years. It's just one more  example of a film that showcases the performers first and foremost and leaves the rest of the film to flounder in it's own mediocrity. And of course: EVERY single actor takes a shot at the accent.If you happened to be from Boston that gets really tired after a while.\nReally tired.",

Many years later, as full-grown adults, their lives suddenly turn back to intertwine following the mysterious murder of the 19-year-old daughter of one of the men.Not only was I impressed by the stellar cast assembled for this film, but I was deeply moved and saddened by the unfortunate twists and turns many people's lives took in this raw, unflinching crime drama. It's a serious, masterfully told piece of work, and everything from acting to direction to music is (not surprisingly) solid across the board...even though at times, admittedly, the film's somewhat dreary, schmaltzy tone could get a little manipulative; thankfully, such is a very, VERY minor complaint in a sea of praise for this amazing piece. One can't stop raving about the performances themselves - particularly from the spectacular trio of male leads: Sean Penn, Tim Robbins and Kevin Bacon. Absolutely astonishing and Oscar-worthy - every single one of them, and then some (supporting players, etc.) Granted, it took me a little while to get used to their sometimes grating Boston accents, but in time their convincing personalities and dilemmas grew on me heavily.In a time where, to be brutally honest, the amount of genuinely good films is dwindling to a respectable few, \"Mystic River\" is a very welcome surprise for me.

Three young boys, Sean, Jimmy and Dave, are playing the street and decide to carve their names in fresh cement.As they are doing this, a man pulls over and stats to argue with the kids. He makes Dave get in the car so he could \"tell his mom\". When the boys have grown up and have children of their own, a new horrible act happens.Jimmy's daughter, Katie, gets killed. Sean, who is now a police officer has to solve the murder. And Dave is now a suspect...So that was the story, now about the actor performances. Sean Penn got an Oscar for his amazing performance. He plays the bittered father (Jimmy) perfectly. A father who would do anything to catch his daughter's killer. If the police don't catch him, Jimmy will make sure he catches him anyway. Tim Robbins also got an Oscar for best supporting actor. Robbins also plays an outstanding role as a confused man who constantly bears a burden on his shoulder.The burden was put their in his childhood, when he stepped into that car. Kevin Bacon is such a marvelous actor. They could've easily cut Sean Penn's Oscar in half and give the second piece to Kevin Bacon. To Sean (Kevin Bacon), Jimmy and Dave are just people now. He doesn't think of them as friends anymore. He will solve the case and he is very competent because he thinks further than his partner Whitey (Fishburne) All in all, I think these 3 actors form the strongest treesome ever seen in acting history.I think Mystic River is Clint Eastwood's best film as a director. Unforgiven was good, Million Dollar Baby great but Mystic River is the greatest. Thank God for Clint Eastwood, Kevin Bacon, Sean Penn and Tim Robbins.",

Having already decided not to have anything positive to say about Penn because of his anti-American behavior as of late, I did not expect to walk out of the theatre heralding him as having turned in one of the most stellar performances I have ever witnessed on film. I will never forget the poignant and disturbing scene with Penn and Robbins sharing on the front porch overlooking the very street where they each began their troubling journey toward manhood. In this moment manhood is outweighed by the overpowering sense of loss being thrust upon Penn as he laments his daughter's brutal murder...as he passionately bemoans her loss telling Robbins \"I can't even cry for her, I can't even cry for her.\"...Robbins with one line brings it all into focus when he tells Penn (Johnny Markhum_ ...\"you're crying now'.While Penn and Robbins have the more meaty roles, Kevin Bacon turns in an excellent performance with perhaps the bigger challenge of playing the less disturbed of the three childhood friends with skill and poise...he does it beautifully. Perhaps this is why Bacon has withstood the test of time in his career. He has not put himself into a box refusing to play only those roles which flatter or allow him all the exposure all of the time. He is as adept at sharing a scene as he is at carrying one. Bravo Kevin Bacon!Mystic River is a fine film, and while Robbins and Penn may not be my personal favorites of people I would choose to spend an evening with getting to know better, I must admit, having watched them in this film, I have to say they have finely honed their craft and for this reason, Mystic River is a must see!

That Sean Penn and Kevin Bacon were able to create believable characters in the midst of this is an Oscar-worthy feat. Where a single glance between characters or a lingering shot would have done, we instead where treated to insipid \"here's what I was thinking just then\" style dialog and \"recapping the action of the last five minutes\" exposition. If I had left the theater repeatedly during the show perhaps I would be singing the praises of this unique scripting innovation, but since I didn't I felt instead like I was watching back to back episodes of a serial that kept welcoming back it's audience. 2/10",

You could say that Mystic River is a who-done-it movie, but I think it's just much more than that. It's a story about three old friends, Jimmy, Dave and Sean who meet each other again after being separated for years, because of very tragic circumstances. Jimmy's daughter is missing and after a while she is found death, murdered. Sean, the policeman, has to solve this mystery and Dave is the main suspect. But something else is going on, something that happened to them in the past and is the reason why they were separated as friends in the first place. Dave became the biggest victum of that past incident, but what happened then, still has a big influence on the present life's of all three of them. The story is moving very slowly as I was saying before, but in a time of fast and action-packed blockbusters I realy could appreciate that. It's just something different for a change. The acting is superb, especially that of the three leads. What can I say. Sean Penn, I just love the guy, but also Kevin Bacon and Tim Robbins were wonderful. There is this scene between Dave (Tim Robbins) and his wife which gave me goose-flesh all over.\nSo far, so good. So what's up with the \"but...\". Well, the following... I loved this movie until a few minutes before the ending. You see, Jimmy, makes a mistake. A big mistake. Something he just can't change any more, and he just can't do anything to make up for it. One thing is for sure though. This mistake is going to make him feel guilty for the rest of his life. Jimmy feels the guilt, but there is no time to go deeper into that. His wife makes some excuse for the thing he has done and also Sean \"tells\" him that he knows and forgives him. And this is where the movie ends. So his wife and friend forgive, but how will it end for Jimmy? Will he ever be able to life with the guilt? When I walked out of the cinema I still had the feeling that the movie had ended to soon (although it's very long) and that Mr. Eastwood should have done something (what, I'm not sure) with Jimmy's guilt.\nStill, although the ending was a bit disappointing for me, I still think this is a very good movie. Something really word watching.",

It's a great story told really well, nothing more nothing less.  My only suggestion for anyone interested in this film is: go see it and decide for yourself. \nMystic River is a film about how tragedy shapes people's lives. Some people cope and some people fall apart, but in the end no is ever the same again. Tim Robbins, Sean Penn, and Keven Bacon play three characters whose friendship is torn apart by a childhood tragedy. It is only after another tragedy many years later that they finally come together. What takes place next is a course of events that's both intriguing in its mystery and exciting in its action. But Mystic River is far more then mere thriller. It's a character study. It's not the twists and turns of the plot that effects the audience but the twists and turns of the character's emotions. We feel for these characters because they look, feel, move, and act like real human beings. There are great performances from this great cast but the movie never plays like a show case for there talent. It's good to see a movie return to classic Hollywood story telling. So many movies try to impress us with cool CGI, mind boggling plot twists, and over done camera tricks. The problem with that is that these movies often lose sight of what's really important: the characters. The characters in Mystic River are front and center and we see them for who they are. My only real critique of this film is the blaring music that just seems too much at times; other then that I really can't complain.",

I didn't buy the whole twist at the end, its building up to something much bigger and it kinda lets you down, but from the revealing of the twist it gets worse.  The last 10 minutes or so are really bad.  The whole scene with Sean Penn and his wife in their dead daughters room didn't seem right, its a very uncomfortable wrap up to all the emotion they've felt so far, with them making out on her bed like that, its just odd.  I wish it would've just ended after the scene on the sidewalk, I think that could've saved alot of the issues I have with this film.

Most scenes don't have bright colors until the end. I liked this it gave the movie a grittier feel than having it filmed with bright colors. 3. The plot was pretty good, it keeps you watching the entire movie, sometimes it drags on but I didn't think it was too predictable.The Bad: 1. The audience never really feels for Tim Robbins character I don't think. After him escaping in the beginning I felt for him but Robbins preformance through me off, I don't know what he was going for with it. 2. At the end I felt sort of like I watched a 2 hour law and order episode. There are the same type elements, a crime, then the 2 detectives putting it all together by interviewing people.

Nothing important has been altered from the Lehane novel. (It turns out that Clint Eastwood really did EARN that Palm d'Or award this film garnered at Cannes.) The acting is superb (especially Sean Penn's and Kevin Bacon's, but I found Tim Robbin's portrayal hauntingly realistic, in spite of the earlier criticisms of his role which I had encountered). Lawrence Fishburne was engagingly real, and the Chapman & Nelson duo as the Savage Brothers was riveting. And what a nice tip-of-the-hat cameo by Eastwood's old amigo, Eli Wallach, who gave 210% in his 3-minute role. Eastwood has elevated himself to the level of mastery on this one. It's been SO long since a combo of writers & director have opted NOT to \"fix\" a great novel that isn't broken in the first place. I hope it starts a new trend. Thanks, Clint!",

            "content": "Welcome to Mystic River, where already-bad things go horribly array!This movie is not in any way upbeat, I'll tell you that right now. It all begins with three neighborhood pals, Jimmy Markusm, Sean Devine and Dave Boyle. They're laughing, they're playing street hockey, they're writing their names in wet cement...and then a would-be cop shows up and drags Dave off in his car. We suspect something isn't right about this - and our instincts are correct. This is no cop, it's a child molester. Dave gets away a few days later but his life is never the same, and he (understandably) quits hanging out with Jimmy and Sean.Fast forward about twenty-five years or so, and they are all grown up, still living in the same parts of Boston. Dave (Tim Robbins) is haunted by his childhood but trying to have a decent life with his wife Celeste (Marcia Gay Harden) and son. Jimmy is on his second marriage to Celeste's cousin Annabeth (Laura Linney) and has two daughters with her and an oldest, Katie, from his first marriage. And Sean (Kevin Bacon) spends most of his time on the job - he's a cop - with his partner Laurence Fishburn (strange, but cool). He's mostly in a funk because his wife left him.So here's the deal. Katie Markum turns up missing. Dave was the last to see her. Dave comes home that night all bloody and disgusting and claims to have been mugged. The next morning, Sean and his cop squad are on the job tracking down Katie Markum, getting the heads up from her abandoned car. He finds her body and it ain't pretty. Jimmy flips out (just about the most powerful scene I've seen since...oh...21 Grams...Dead Man Walking...there's just something about Sean Penn, I'll tell ya) and vows to catch her killer. Isn't that Sean's job? You see the problems.The good news? Three old friends are kind of reunited. The bad news? Dave doesn't exactly make a great case for himself, and things go from bad to worse fast. Sean is seemingly the glue that's supposed to hold everything together - Dave's insanity, Jimmy's rage...it's all just a huge mess and it's about to explode, as you can probably imagine.There are a few plot problems here. When you learn who killed Katie and why, it just doesn't quite add up. Not to mention a very uncertain ending in which we're not sure who's guilty and who's going to jail and who's friends with who.What you definitely have here are 3 great performances from Sean, Kevin, and Tim, as well as amazing support from the lovely Marcia & Laura - and a not-too-shabby job by good 'ole Laurence. It's a wonderful cast, and their individual intensities add up to a really hot ensemble. I like this movie, even though it's wickedly, heart-wrenchingly depressing. That's ok though - just remember - at least YOUR life isn't this bad! 4/5",

Mystic River, is a tough movie to judge because it lingers between having a large-cast motivated monetarily and having a large-cast motivated to this movie artistically.At times the movie seemed to have some acting flaws. Other times, the cast members impressed me a lot, I give a little extra credit to Sean Penn because I think he did an outstanding job. (Although, I would have kind of preferred Bill Murray to win Best Actor in 2003 for \"Lost in Translation.\") I think the movie didn't touch base emotionally to viewers as well as it could have (especially with the other competitive movies in the recent years that have been humanistic revolutions, and really have been able to convey subtle emotions and themes of movies to the viewer better in these last few years). But, the character development was really presented well. I think that Clint Eastwood did an amazing directorial job and the movie didn't bore me at all (it will bore some people who are impatient). I think that Mystic River is really above average compared to other large-cast, monetary motivated movies. Those types of movies are more apt to produce theatrical error. 7/10",

After twenty years, the friends are going separate ways \u0096 Jimmy is an ex-con trying to stay strait, Sean is a cop on the brink of break down and Dave is a looser. After Jimmy's daughter is murdered, the friends are brought together again.I have read Dennis Lehane's novel about a year ago and I found his narrative extremely depressing. As I was reading the book I actually could feel my serotonin levels going down. So I could not bring myself to watch the film for a long time even after the Oscars. I finally watched it on DVD and there are good and bad things about it.What I think makes me dislike the film is that the story's moral and ethical grounds are very confusing. The story shows the world in upside-down way where the \"bad guy\" is glamorised and the victim is portrayed as a very unattractive person. Whatever I think about Jimmy Markum I have to admit he is quite charismatic guy, where poor Dave Boyle just looked as if he deserved anything.In a way the film's story is similar to the \"Unforgiven\" rather than \"Shawshank redemption\". The main tag line is that you can not change anything in your life, if you are a killer, you are a killer, and if you are a victim you are a victim.The film is actually much less depressing than a book and there are even some funny dialogues in it. But I thought that some of the story lines were not very well explained. The main example is the ending. Because in the book the author actually gives the character's thoughts behind their front there is no question of where each of them stands at the end. The end is very black\u0096and-white and in a way calling for the \"Mystic river-2\". In the film, if I have not read the book before, I would not understand what Sean's position is at the end. Also it seems that Sean's character is underdeveloped and poorly explained on a whole.The cast is what made this film worthy watching. Sean Penn did a great job, but I think that he was much deeper in the \"21 grams\". The best actor in the film for me was Tim Robbins. His portrait of David Boyle was almost out of this world. I applaud this actor when he can take on such an unattractive character and portray it with dignity.The opening scene of abduction sent chills down my spine \u0096 atmosphere was so thick you could cut it with the knife. The director/camera-man work is exceptional there.Overall \u0096 4/10",

Against Europe's predominant and more balanced philosophy in which crime is no more than what it us: a burden to society of difficult treatment, Clint champions a regrettable social deviation in which citizens' frustrations are satisfied through a scapegoat which, upon satisfaction, leaves him more ignorant and blinded than he was. Whether it is the Jews in the Germany in the thirties, the Armenians in the pre-WW1 Turkey, thugs in China, adulterous women in Muslim countries or criminals in present-day America: honest citizens need someone to crap on. The appalling result of this disparity is that the criminal suffers a double punishment, the second one utterly undeserved and owed to a social pathology.In the case in point: the spectator is confronted with a revolting crime in which one's visceral crave for a scapegoat is put inside a morbid labyrinth of who-and-who's not, until the intrigue eventually satisfied to ones wishes. In the course of it, a pedophile is beaten to the pulp (to death) because he was abusing a child in a car, and a suspected pervert criminal is portrayed as obviously deserving to be the spectator's scapegoat; something which, when it occurs in real life to real people, will do doubt release such reactions, for it is obvious that if one has been sexually and brutally abused, one may probably and justifiably wish to wreak vengeance onto any pedophile; and that if one's beloved daughter is killed by a pervert, one will probably and understandably like to chop him to pieces, and it would be probably justifiable in many cases. The problem occurs when the masses are served this as bread a circuses.This type of movie reminds me of George Orwell's Nineteen-Eighty-Four, in which the masses are exposed to these type of Manichaean movies where the bad guy is hunted for and ultimately bombed to death to their ultimate catharsis.",

Yes, I agree with everyone saying that the acting is great. No, I don't agree that Eastwood directed brilliantly and no, I don't agree that the story was well written and scripted. Eastwood has always had the problem of pacing his films way too slowly. The material here helps Eastwood keep a better pace than usual, but there were numerous moments during the film that I felt time dragging on (let's get to the point Clint!) Also, let me critique the screenplay/story. Yeah, yeah, so the story is Shakespearean--what???? I didn't feel that at all. I felt like this was just another crime film with great acting and character development. However, how the characters developed left much to be desired. I simply did not care by the end of the film. What I did feel was confusion and anger. Why were these characters behaving the way they did at the very end--it just didn't add up. Kevin Bacon's character did nothing????? What? Why? The 'mystery' part of the film was handled fairly, but there are not that many suspects and when the suspect is apprehended there's no satisfaction. Mistakes that Sean Penn's character engage in late in the film are also unsatisfying because nothing gets resolved. I just felt short changed by the story mostly. If the ending had been tightened up and reasonably resolved, I might have thought Oscar time. As it is, Penn and Robbins were good, but Oscar calibre? Mmmmm, no. Maybe if the film had been better, then yes. And another thing, I kept thinking (because of Eastwood's direction) that more was going to be show/explained about Dave's abduction, but by the end of the film, it felt like one more unresolved and unsatisfying piece of the story. Also, pointless to have Sean's character periodically speaking to his wife over the phone. I didn't care about her, but I did want to know more about why their relationship was the way it was (which never was RESOLVED!) Too many unresolved plot pieces and somehow all the critics felt this film was THE BEST, THE GREATEST? I'm waiting a couple of months for the real Oscar contenders.",

Well, \"Mystic River\" now gets my vote.   It is a tragic story, based on a superb novel by Dennis Lehane.  If you read the book, the movie is very faithful to it, no \"Hollywood Happy Ending\" here.Clint Eastwood and his cast have created a story that pulls you in will not let you go.  The tragedy here is that the Academy Awards cite individual performances.  I wish there was away the whole cast and crew could get an award as a group because to single out one or two folks from what is a truly classic ensemble seems unfair.  However, if you had to I guess Sean Penn and Tim Robbins stick out.  Eastwood will definitely get a Director nod.  The Screenplay will get cited as well.  I think and hope that Marcia Gay Harden and Laura Linney both get nominated as their roles really are the key. Marcia Gay Hardens portrayal of a wife who loves her husband but doubts him and unwittingly betrays him is a classic.  The last scene of her looking for husband (Robbins) and realizing she is the reason for his fate is haunting. I saw an artile that summed up Laura Linney's character as Lady Macbeth.

A choice is made by this same boy as an adult that affects them all again. This film was frustrating. Not only because the picture was choppy and too long but because I got so irritated at the characters and their actions. Not that that is a bad thing; it makes one think and demonstrates that we can't always predict human behavior, that people do stuff for god knows why and what seems reasonable at the time makes no sense when reflected upon, (or does it?) Some great moments, some great potential, but spoiled with it's Pearl Harborish discombobulated \"why isn't this over already\" format.",

It wanted to be wannabe neighborhood gangsters that were so unbelievable from their obvious personas to their even more obvious wardrobe selection. Usually when I've watched a great movie movie I am immediately googling the story behind it, the actors intentions, the director's creative process. Honestly I am too lazy after watching it to want to know if it was based on a book - I didn't even know it was a Clint Eastwood movie till I started reading the reviews. It was like Bridges of Madison went out with a tv adaptation (pg-13) of Goodfellas and Mystic River was the result. Totally over the top. This was a movie that had as top a cast as you could have and an over-produced sensibility you'd find with a 90s movie. Was very disappointed.

The reviews and ratings are generally far too high for this movie, which does not deliver on the potential it had. I have not read the book, so I don't know how accurately the story is depicted, but the movie in my opinion is faulty enough all on its own.Mystic River bases its story on a \"twist\", which does not even happen. The entire film keeps you guessing; about the who, the why, and the what. It builds confusion and uncertainty within you, which is what I liked about it. Hence, I was ready for a grand ending to solve everything -- which never came. The ending absolutely destroyed the potential the story could have capitalized on. It's almost as if everything leading up to it did not matter, and you just wasted two hours of your life.As a movie, Mystic River is still watchable, if you can enjoy it without thinking too much. I myself am more of a thinker, and completely over-thinking the possibilities this movie did not deliver on ruined the experience for me. I cannot fathom how it got nominated for an Oscar for Best Writing. I suppose it plays on a theme of \"sometimes the answer is just an accident\", but I couldn't accept that as a valid conclusion.There are other faults, too, as the movie is riddled with clich\u00e9s, and it seemed that the characters' reasoning throughout was rather implausible and incoherent. In all it was enjoyable for give or take 60 minutes. . . just not consecutive ones. Unless this movie is trying to teach that sometimes something that seems so massive and complex can in reality be a small, unrelated and inexplicable mistake, I shall maintain that the writing, with that ending, was not even in the ballpark of Oscar-brilliance.---By the way, could someone explain why Sean, a cop, did not arrest Jimmy, after he found out what happened to Dave?",

The whole emotional tone shifted sideways in an unpleasant way and everything after that came off like a studio add-on to neatly wrap everything up with a bow. Didn't need Laura Linney doing Lady Macbeth, didn't need the parade scene (although I'll grant that it did add in the sense of showing the isolation and desperation of Marcia Gay Harden's character).Everything could have been wrapped up in an emotionally satisfying way with Kevin Bacon driving off with his suppressed suspicions of his childhood friend and Sean Penn to deal with his actions.It's like someone at the studio put a gun to Eastwood's and Cox's head and said \"you're going to add this because I don't get the ending\".I'm normally forgiving of films but this one disappointed me.",

Coincidentally not long after Sean Penn travels to Iraq to defend Saddam Hussein and Tim Robbins complains to the news media that his opposition to the Bush administration has turned him into a victim of its fascist censorship. So to prove Tim wrong and give Sean a message of congratulations, this strange film is showered with nominations from the Academy and its stars are summarily given Oscars. My question is, why? The film is technically inferior, its story grossly implausible, and the acting marginal at best. With the exception of Laurence Fishburne, who knows his craft (though it doesn't completely show here), all cast members should be recycled through acting school. Tim Robbins was great in Fraternity Vacation (1985) and Sean Penn was at his best as Fast Times at Ridgemont High's Spiccoli, but neither are Laurence Olivier or Charleton Heston reborn. It amazes me that the citizens of Boston didn't have another tea party with the film reels upon seeing it in theaters. If my city were depicted with such disregard for its style of speaking and neighborhood culture, you could certainly count on a more aggressive response. \"I don kwest-shun yer vows\" and \"We berry R sins he, Dave\" may appear to be reflective of Eastern Massachusetts vernacular in the minds of Mystic River's condescending screenwriters, but is laughable to anyone who has spent at least a day in Samuel Adams' hometown. Clint Eastwood seems to be atoning for his years of Spaghetti Westerns with such cheeseballs as Bridges of Madison County and A Perfect World and now this. Who could blame him?

He gets his men to snoop around, and try and find out who did it, while two detectives, (Laurence Fishburne, and Kevin Bacon), conduct their own investigations as well.The same night, Dave Boyle (Tim Robbins), comes home, covered in blood.  He tells Celeste (Marcia Gay Harden), his wife, he had to protect himself from a mugger, and may have killed him.  Nothing is reported in the papers of that, and with time, Celeste becomes suspicious, and later, the detectives do as well.And then the story unfolds.  Now that's the basic, basic plotline. \nMystic River in an incredible piece of filmmaking.  Is it the Best Picture of the year?  No, but it's up there.The strongest aspect of the film would be the acting.  Every actor, and character is dead on.  I can't imagine the film with anyone else.  The cinematography does not rely on flashiness to tell it's story, and its subtlety is a real asset to the film. .  And the script is just flawless, at least from a first viewing.

Let'see... Three friends end up in a situation where one of them ends up getting terribly abused and scarred for life. Fine. Now, one of this guys daughters gets murdered. Another one of three is the leading investigator of the murder. Hmmm... So we have two down, what's the role of the third one? Well, he's none other than the prime suspect of that crime! But wait, there's more... On that same tragic night the suspect ended up killing another guy. A child molester, no less.You think we're done? No way Jose. The victim's father used to have a crime partner, which he killed, and the partner's son used to date the deceased girl, so he's a suspect too. And there's also his brother, the gun, the suspect's wife, the police arriving just when the guy is confronting his brother, etc...

I read and thoroughly enjoyed Mystic River. The movie is a faithful and intelligent adaptation of the book and therein lies a problem. In order to incorporate the main elements of the narrative,  the film is a bit long, and to be honest there are a couple of scenes that are overlong. Clint Eastwood wrote the score - I guess if you are Clint Eastwood, you can do about anything you like - but the music doesn't add anything. While I am dealing with the negatives, I must also add that a very few times the film teeters on the brink of melodrama. Beyond that I have nothing but good things to say. Eastwood's direction is steady, intelligent and sensitive. Most of the settings - indoor and out - are evocative, accurate and even mystical. Kevin Bacon as police detective Sean Devine is terrific. Of the three main characters, his is most centered, most normal, and that's how he plays it. Sean Penn will probably be nominated for Best Actor. The most memorable scene in the film - sadly one being widely shown in the trailers - is Penn's, and he delivers hugely. Tim Robbins' character is maybe the most demanding. His accent is consistent and believable, and he is one of those actors that can act with posture.  Lawrence Fishburene, surely one of America's best male actors, is marvelously effective as Bacon's partner. This film isn't a ten, but it is a \"must see.\"",

One day, while playing hockey in the streets of Boston, Dave is kidnapped and sexually abused by two men for four days. The story jumps forward to the present, where the boys (now grown-ups) are still living in Boston, but they do not participate in the same social circles. Jimmy now owns his own neighborhood store, where his 19-year-old daughter Katie also works. One night Katie goes out with her friends to a local bar, where the traumatized Dave is sitting. He comes home late with blood on his clothes and a big scar on his hand. The same night Katie is murdered and the mystery of her death begins. I think Penn, Bacon and Robbins do a great job in their lead roles. Marcia Gay Harden also does a great job as Boyle's distraught wife, Celeste. The Boston setting is fantastic and the overall mood is dark and mystic. Eastwood did a good job with this one, so I will give it 7 out of 10 stars.

Since I highly respect Clint Eastwood's directing activities, I was looking forward to this film quite a bit, especially in view of the Oscar nominations it received and awards that it won.  However, I found the film somewhat disjointed.  Since the name of the film is \"Mystic River\" perhaps it could have had a more coherent flow if Eastwood had used the theme of the river to stitch together the different events in the lives of the main characters.  For example, when the young boy was abducted, use the river as his means of escape.  Later, have the river disgorge the body of Ray Harris after the Sean Penn character is released from prison.  Place the discovery of Sean's daughter's body near the river.  Likewise, have the river connected to Dave Boyle's activities. (I'm trying hard not to write a spoiler).As it was, I thought it was misleading to portray the Sean Penn character as having only a little brush with the law as a young man.  His relationship to the Savage brothers indicated a much darker character than that.  There was no background story of the problems the Tim Robbins character had suffered throughout his adult life as a result of his childhood molestation.  The relationship between the three main characters was not close so the emotional impact of the conclusion was blunted and rather muddled.  Robbins and Penn were both good in their roles but I would not place either of their performances in the \"best actor\" category.  I know Hollywood is, for some reason, down on Tom Cruise as an actor, but he definitely portrayed more emotional range in \"The Last Samurai\" than anyone in Mystic River.",

Eastwood's directorial style I found to be drab and the story itself highly unoriginal.I left the theatre feeling very disappointed and somewhat depressed, as the characters in this film are the type of people I'd want to avoid at all costs in real life and the sordid, ugly story nothing I'd ever want to experience.",

It is a stunning portrait of how the choices you make and are forced to make affect your life and even the way you function in the world.

            "content": "I've read many reviews and comments about this film, but few seem to grasp what this film is really about.Some have rightly pointed out that it is a film about the consequences of vigilantism, a film about revenge and (as Clint himself said) how 'evil begets evil'. But the ending has confused, even annoyed many people. Some have expressed concern that the message seems to be that it's OK to commit murder as long as you do it in the name of your family. They wonder what Eastwood and Helgeland were thinking to devise such a 'hateful and evil' message. But this is a most important and searching question, for it focuses on the crux of the film.The Corleone family in THE GODFATHER films (the ultimate vigilante's) were a law unto themselves - any action was justifiable if it was in the interest of 'the family'. This is a creed most would recognise as hateful and evil. In MYSTIC RIVER, we watch a vigilante story play itself out, culminating in a patriotic street parade inter-cut with what seems to be a justification for vigilantism. This is not mere irony. Eastwood portrays a community in which vigilantism has a place, a community not so different from those in Western sagas where lawless frontiers were tamed by men who spoke with the barrel of gun. He is drawing a contemporary analogy.It's no coincidence that some of the characters are mute. Muteness is part of the subtext of the film, referring to having no voice or refusing to use the one we have. Nor is it coincidental that in the final few minutes we observe mute communication (through eye contact and hand gestures) between characters who seem to be expressing a mute acquiescence.In MYSTIC RIVER, Eastwood asks us to examine our own muteness - our own 'hearts of darkness'. The film ends with the camera (the viewer) plunging into the dark and murky Mystic River, suggesting that we are on the verge of plunging headlong into dark irreconcilable waters. The film is an allegory that warns against ideas and actions that lead people, countries and governments (!!) into political vigilantism. I wouldn't call MYSTIC RIVER a great film, but because of the importance (and potency) of the message, it deserves serious consideration for its disturbing and daring subtext.",

A typical story about three old friends from the youth, that meet again 30 years later when they all get involved in a murder. Of course, you have the good guy that became a cop, the bad guy that decided to become good due to the love for her daughter, but suddenly turns back to bad after she is murdered, and the silly and innocent guy, who will surely be blamed for it, closes the circle. You can probably imagine the rest of the story. Extremely predictable from the beginning, it makes it hard to stay tuned until you get to a point where you really want it to end. But no..., there's still more than half an hour to go. Tim Robbins does very well in his character, but Sean Penn is quite disappointing..., as well as the whole movie.",

            "content": "***SPOILERS!*** \"Mystic River\" shocked me and, from a certain point on, made me nervous and sweating, wishing I could leave the house to escape watching the friends-kills-friend murder scene. This was because of its underlying sense of trauma; now I have absolutely nothing against the use of terrible moments in high drama -- it's almost inevitable, as we all know too well since we first read a page of Dostoevskij or sat through a Shakesperean tragedy. However, one thing is the description of the dark side of reality (AND human beings), another is the spectacle of trauma, an experience capable of twisting or damaging our personality at a very basic level, and in earlier stages of our life. Dave, the scapegoat-victim of that terrible sequence, is such a damaged man; witnessing his prolonged, delayed execution on the shore of Mystic River gave me the creeps, like I was caught in a recurrent nightmare. Note that trauma as such is unknown to classic tragedists: it is Freud who invented the Oedipus complex, not Sophocles. When that doomed character killed his father (by accident) and married his mother (unaware it was her), he was a full-grown man: Oedipus was probably never `traumatized' in our present sense of the word, but became all the same a perfect embodiment of guilt and ill-fate. Discovering what he had done, he blinded himself as a form of repentance: self-mutilation as atonement. In contemporary film, however, guilt and trauma seem to matter a lot more than their catharsis. In \"Mystic River\", all proportions established, there is no way for atonement; its characters seem to be doomed from the start, one (Dave) is destined to function as scapegoat of this particular tragedy, and when the truth finally surfaces, there's nothing that can be done to change things. The only thing that CAN be attempted is to immediately stop the chain of killing and abuse, which is why the cop Kevin Bacon won't even arrest former friend-turned-murderer Sean Penn. It's the sole \"catharsis\" we are permitted in such a drama, nothing more positive than that. In the end, everybody is \"blinded\" in `Mystic River': Tim Robbins by losing his mind and life (after turning a murderer himself); Kevin Bacon by losing a wife; Sean Penn by losing a child and the apparent normality of his squalid life. That violence will stop at this level, and that Bacon's wife will return with a baby, are the only thin hopes in an otherwise ultra-black movie verging on horror. It seemed to me a film about an impossible \"pursuit of loneliness\" on hone hand (the characters, like so many Americans and other Westerners today, try with all their force to escape friendship, because of an innate sense of guilt or disturbance), and about a metaphysical truth on the other -- that \"evil begets more evil\", as Mr Eastwood is reported to have said. This is a completely justifiable statement, but being the gloomy film that it is, \"Mystic River\" remains a hopeless drama, so as to testify a modern approach to tragedy which largely consists in making a monument to feelings of guilt, impotence and loss of innocence (if any). Child abuse IS a tragic reality, but maybe not an hopeless one; in a world that is still human, traumas should be fought back and/or or accepted, not necessarily elevated to a metaphysical rank. Certainly, movies such as `Mystic River' offer more than one level of understanding, so that its ultimate theme may not deal with child abuse or revenge at all. In fact, it ultimately deals with the extremely thin interspexing of chance and chaos from which our lives are fabricated. With the fatality of our very appearance on Earth. Mr Eastwood, as an artist, showed us with painful participation the evil that was done; it's time for his public to find some way out.",

My suggestion to you would be to delete their numbers from your phone and stop returning their calls. This movie is horrible and that's that. It's incredible to me that anyone would enjoy this boring mess of a film. What's so bad about it? Try everything.Let's start with the script. Not a single conversation is constructed with believable dialogue. For lines supposedly spoken by middle-class Bostonians, they sure are pretty literary (I'm from Boston, trust me on this one). The movie talks like a daytime soap opera. It's corny and the flat, depressing performances make it even cornier. This would have been fine if the plot had been decent, but alas, this was also too much to ask. The story is supposed to keep you guessing. I was guessing, that is, try to guess when this darn thing would end. What it all adds up to is a script with a million different angles which the writer and director could have fully explored but didn't.In the way of performances, the cast, for the most part, is absolutely painful to watch (I say \"for the most part\" because a few of the actors were very good). Most notable among the poor performances was that of the constantly flat Laura Linney. Fortunately, she wasn't on screen very much, but when she was, her blandness stuck out like a sore thumb, even in the presence of other mediocre performances.So, is there anything good about this movie? Well, yes, but unfortunately, it's not enough to outweigh everything. Even so, I feel a few positive words are deserved, especially by Marcia Gay Harden. Her performance was brilliant and convincing. Every time she appeared on the screen, she shown like a beacon of hope in this wasteland of a film. Also among the good performances was that of Thomas Guiry, although his emotions in the movie seemed unrealistic, but that was clearly the fault of an atrocious screenplay. I feel I should also give a nod to Kevin Chapman, Adam Nelson and Robert Wahlberg who portray Bostonian men quite well. That's about as far as the positives go for this movie.On the whole, it really is a mess. So, if your friends start singing the praises of this movie, I would think twice about going with them to the cinema.",

As for acting, well I have already mentioned Seany-boy, but as for the rest: Tim Robbins is simply horrible, Laurence Fishburne is poorly utilized and Kevin Bacon... well, lets just say that if you have the previous three actors in a movie and Kevin Bacon comes out on top with the best performance, you got a heck-of-a-lot of problems.

It deals with troubling subjects such as pedophilia, murder, and revenge.  However, for most of the film, the story is absorbing and believable, the acting is superlative, and the personalities and motivations of the major characters are well developed. About mid-way through the film, I was agreeing with most of the other reviewers who have praised the film and recommended it for Oscar consideration.However, with the long, drawn-out, ant-climatic, and even dishonest ending; my assessment of the film crashed from \"outstanding\" to \"mediocre\".  In the third-last scene, there is a horrifying moment when two of the characters are speaking, and the resolution of the murder and revenge plot-lines become clear to both.  THIS is the true climax of the film, and it should have ended there..... even the setting of this scene ties back to the start of the film.  However, it appears that either the author of the book or the screenwriter was so pleased with his work, that he didn't want to see it end; because there are two totally superfluous scenes which not only add nothing to the story, but they also effect an unbelievable, depressing, and unexpected \"morality shift\" in two of the major characters.  There is also a \"side-story\" throughout the film involving one of the major characters and his absent wife.  This subplot is also somewhat resolved at the end, but the problem is, who cares?  The subplot was one of the few weak points of the first part of the film, and focusing on it at the end simply degrades the whole experience.Nice try Clint, but 10 minutes lopped off the end would have resulted in an outstanding, moving, and thought-provoking film.As-is, it rates 6 out of 10.",

Don't get me wrong - Sean Penn is good (a combo of DeNiro and Mitchum physically) but I could see other actors playing the Jimmy Markum part - Kevin Spacey for one comes to mind. Penn may be deserving of a nomination but the competition out there may be strong enough to split or take away votes.  Clint Eastwood's direction was excellent, but my gripe is with the running time.  The film could have been at least 20 minutes shorter and accomplished the same thing.  I rarely look at my watch to see how much longer, but believe me I was tempted.

The movie is about 2.5 hours. Yet, the movies would have to be at least 3.5 hours long to correctly cover all of the points it attempted to hit.

Eastwoods direction is so complete that the manner in which the characters communicate their emotions to the audience one could swear that it is your conscience he is directing not the actors. Secondly, to further enhance the first point there is one particular scene early in the film featuring Penn in which I was brought to tears. Never have I cried in a film that is not an emotionally contrived tear-jerker (the ETs of this world etc). Even in those situations I was very young and that was merely sobbing not full blown crying. In conclusion there are two points that prevent me from hailing this film as perfect. Firstly, I don't think that Fishburnes character was given quite the degree of emotional depth and communication as other significant characters. Secondly as I'm only 28 there are many films that are yet to be made that I will see over the next 40-50 years of my life that could be a little better and I feel that dispensing \"perfects\" too frequently will reduce the actual description of perfection. Suffice to say that if I were to die tomorrow this film would be an uneqivocal 10/10 as a better film I'm yet to see. Ever. There are very few absolutes in life, as human beings by their very construction are emotional and those emotions are more often than not fickle and are massively influenced by the past and how we perceive the here and now. Clint Eastwood is into his 8th decade of living-who better to perfectly illustrate the complexities our existence and the real meaning for our living? He offers very few answers but poses many questions that will leave you wondering for many a moon once you have vacated his domain and and more pertinently our domain he, such is the films emotional penetration.",

Eastwood does not play a character in this film, and there's no reason he should considering he already has so much talent to work with.

One day Dave was abducted before their friend's eyes by two men who abused him for days in a basement. Later, Dave married and had a son but the terrible and painful memory of his childhood haunted him and causes his death. Jimmy owns a liquor store, married for the second time with three daughters one from his previous marriage. His daughter got murdered at the age of nineteen. This event is what brings the path of their life to the same neighborhood again, \"The place that mark who they are\". Sean became a police detective, who is investigating Jimmy's daughter murder. Dave became one of the primary suspects. What makes Mystic River a great film is how it gradually digs deeper into the story revealing bits and pieces of information to finally surprise the audience with a dramatic, unexpected and a great finally. The knot feeling in your stomach that is experienced during the time and even after watching this movie is caused by the facts of real life used in the movie. Facts that parents are always terrified of. Mystic River also shows in perfect sense how the past can affect our future. I would recommend this movie to the fixed news viewer. Reality, reality!",

The movie opens up with them playing together and then one of them, Jimmy, writes his name in the wet cement and tells his companions, Sean, and Dave, to do the same. Sean writes his name, and then Dave goes to do the same but only gets to write the \"D\" and \"A\" when some men interrupt them. The men act as officers and take Dave away in their car. Unbeknownst to the two boys that Dave has been kidnapped. After four days Dave escapes his kidnappers and returns home. He is a changed boy that doesn't play with Sean or Jimmy anymore. The years go by and Dave is married to Jimmy's wife's cousin and has a son. Jimmy is also married and has three daughters. Sean also is married but his wife has left him taking their baby daughter.One Saturday Jimmy's eldest daughter, Katie, tells her father that she is going out with her friends later. Jimmy tells her to be home early because she has to be present for her younger sister's first communion, and she agrees. Drunk and barhopping with her friends Katie is seen at one bar by Dave. Dave comes home covered and blood and Kate is found dead the next morning. Katie was planning to run away with her boyfriend, Brenden, and get married in Vegas but a killer or killers cut her plans short. The investigation begins to find out who killed Katie as Sean takes over this investigation. Nonetheless, Jimmy searches for answers on his own with the help of his friends.I liked the plot of the movie; it kept me on the edge of my seat. I even started to get nervous about the character Dave. I really felt sympathy for Dave because of his childhood trauma and later when his wife and Jimmy didn't believe his story. I have to admit Dave grew on me, and so did his son. I think the last scene was shot very well. When Dave's son is riding the parade float and his mother is trying to get his attention. I think that scene really captured the bittersweet mood of the movie.What I didn't like was the ending. It was so strange to see that the people in both Katie and Dave's life just moved on like nothing had happened. I wondered how much time had lapsed from the last time Sean and Jimmy talked to the day of the parade. I didn't like not knowing some tiny details like, if Brenden's brother could speak, and if Dave's family was OK and if Sean stopped giving money to Brenden's family and began giving it to Dave's family. Also the effects used I thought were at times too dark to actually see anything.Sean Penn did very nicely acting as Jimmy. I almost came to see him only as Jimmy, and then I remembered he was also in I Am Sam and I liked his character in that movie also. He was very convincing in both films. I think that the audiences will have a love/hate affair with Jimmy, because they will see his sincerity but will also see his flaws that have been magnified to block his good nature. The character of Sean seemed to be a very compassionate man despite his profession of being a homicide detective. To me he was too na\u00efve as he waited for his runaway wife's calls and eventual return. Dave was portrayed very well I truly did feel his pain because he expressed it with much remorse.I did like this film it was a plot-twisting portrayal of crimes committed in neighborhoods. As I said before I became nervous at the point of the climax, almost wanting to yell at Jimmy to stop him. That point was really took my breath away. I really think that audiences would and will grow on this film because it is just so unpredictable. Clint Eastwood knew what he was doing with this movie. His direction of scenes flowed well throughout the screening. I give this film a five out of five.",

When he finds out that his daughters dead body is in the ditch, he gives a performance thats hard to beleive that its just acting. He really looks like he is going through the worst nightmare he could ever imagine. Kevin Bacon (Sean Devine) gives an awesome performance playing the cop who cares for his friends but doesnt want that to get in the way of his work. Tim Robbins (Dave Boyle) plays the molested child, who now is not right in the head. Clint Eastwood has given us a movie that is worth more than 2 viewings in the theatre. This movie stands up to The Unforgiven. The movie may have stellar acting, and wounderful directing, but its not for everybody. If you have a short attention span stay away.

He is referred to as \"a basket case\" and \"damaged goods.\" And in the end, he is murdered and his death is treated as \"no big deal, he was messed up anyway.\" Clint Eastwood and Tim Robbins should be ashamed of their insensitive portrayal of an abused child.

They really brought the movie to life. My one problem with it was that it did seem to have a plot hole or 2. Maybe plot hole isn't the right term but when Tim Robbins was trying to explain why he hadn't told his wife that he had killed a pedophile seemed out of place it didn't make a whole lot of sense but I can look past that.

With all of this in it's favour one could be forgiven for assuming that 'Mystic River' was certain to be far-and-away THE film of 2003. If one was to consider the competition then again, one could be excused from thinking that this WAS it.In many way's Mystic River does achieve what it sets out to do, and it certainly has no trouble in beating it's contenders as far as content goes. But when you consider some of the competition (Return Of The King / Matrix Reloaded & Revolutions) it's not that hard.'Mystic River' is satisfying on many levels. Most notably because of the acting, which is near flawless throughout. Sean Penn (Jimmy) takes the lead and shows us once again that he is without a doubt (one of) the best of his generation. Tim Robbins (Dave) also shows his worth and does well in conveying the contradictions of his character. Kevin Bacon (Sean) holds his own but with a much lesser part, a shame as Bacon is a massively underrated talent today. Someone who came as a surprise was Laura Linney as the knowing and wilful wife of Penn's Jimmy. She play's it cool and calm and by the time we get to see Annabeth's true colours she is all but stealing scenes from Penn.The Direction and Cinematography are of an equally high standard and Eastwood manages to perfectly set the gloomy scene. The area in which the characters live, plays as much of a part as our three leads and as the film progresses it becomes an uncomfortably claustrophobic place to be and to watch.As you can see my comments on 'Mystic River' are favourable. It is a great film that is expertly constructed but there is something missing that I can't quite put my finger on. With all that was going for it my expectations were understandably high, and although it delivered on many points it failed to draw me in emotionally (perhaps the most important thing). Subsequently i was left feeling slightly detached and cold towards the outcome.All in all 'Mystic River' is a precise and fluid drama which is head and shoulders above much of what's on offer, but without the emotional heart that it so sorely lacks it will always be somehow less than the sum of it's parts.8 / 10",

Not to mention the numerous scenes where a character simply looks around the frame for two or three seconds before a cut to something totally different. \nExaggerated Boston accents made much of the clipped dialogue incomprehensible.  I had trouble understanding what Boyle was saying most of the time.  Not everyone from Boston has the Boston accent.** Spoilers ** In addition, the film assumes too much about the audience's inferential abilities.  E.g., when we see the character reach around in the ceiling for the gun, it's not evident that the holster he retrieves is empty, even when he shows the holster to the others-- it's on screen for about 0.3 seconds.  So unless the viewer properly infers that the item Harris retrieves is a holster and that it's empty, the next couple of minutes make no sense whatsoever.I found myself confused and wanting the film to get to the point, and then wanting it to end.  Except there was no point.  I mean, the guy kills the wrong person and gets away with it, and the police don't even look at him?  What was the point of the movie?  Was it only an observation of one man's fall from grace?  \"Unforgiven\" was that and also a cautionary tale, perhaps.  Mystic River has none of the magic and appeal of\"Unforgiven,\" which people have compared Mystic River to.  I admit, I was intrigued by the wife's reaction to her husband admitting having killed the wrong man, and that scene is one of the best in the film.  However it doesn't make up for no less than 3 hours of confusing film with sparse dialogue and the director trying to hide the ball from the audience.  I gave it a 7 because the actors' performances were all outstanding and that makes the movie a watchable story, if not a well-told one.",

Maybe people are so used to stereotypes and formula flicks they just didn't \"get it.\" Lady MacBeth instigated murders, Annabeth didn't, but she was 100% on Jimmy's side, right or wrong. There are still people like that. Jimmy was sinking into depression and falling apart after killing Dave, and she wasn't going to let him self-destruct. What was done couldn't be undone, and she still had two kids to raise, what would she do if he disintegrated? What's so hard to understand about that? I thought Penn did an excellent job portraying all of Jimmy's conflicting emotions. People are rarely all good or all bad, most of us are a bundle of conflicts. I personally didn't relate to the performance of Dave's wife, such a weak, neurotic character was out of place in a lower middle class community. A person like that would have never survived to adulthood. As for all the clever observations about DNA, and was Jimmy arrested, etc., come on, this wasn't CSI where everything is neatly tied up at the end of the hour. In real life lots of wrongs are never righted, and lots of crimes go unsolved, and justice is often all in the perception. It was unremittingly heavy, just like the lives of the people portrayed in that community in Boston's underbelly. The sound was bad, but all in all I thought it was an excellent dramatic movie.",

The police said the gun belonged to the boyfriend's father, who had a previous history with crime.This film involved a lot of brain thinking and kept you guessing who was the killer, the entire time. Having the film being portrayed in Boston also made the film to be more believable. The length of the film didn't come into mind at all because the story-line was so involved and detailed that I was completely in the zone of the film the whole time. I enjoyed that they made this film have a \"dark\" setting; this film would not have had that \"special something\" if there were vibrant colors all around.I did not enjoy the ending, only for the fact that everything unfolded very quickly and then there was about ten minutes of film after the story pretty much was done. There wasn't that much to not like, maybe change a view characteristics about some characters, they all seemed to be southern type of people living in the north.The actors did a great job with telling the story and sending its message. It made it very believable to think that things like that do truly exists, I just wish they didn't seem so well under educated.Overall, Mystic River was perhaps one of the top films I have seen to date. To me it can be comparable to The Bone Collector, which is a fantastic film. This was also the best film that Clint Eastwood has directed and he captured everything so well. If you're into movies that have a good mystery to it that keep you guessing all the way to the unfolding of who did it, then Mystic River should be your next watch. It has a great cast with Sean Penn, Kevin Bacon, and Tim Robbins and these guys know how to make a film worth watching. In my eyes this movie deserves 9 out of 10.",

At first I immediately thought that Davie was the culprit, and my thoughts stayed that way until the last 15 minutes of the movie. The acting was nothing short of spectacular. It's part of the reason why I started to question who killed Katie halfway through the film. From beginning to end this movie makes you question your judgment skills to know what's right or wrong. The kidnapper at the beginning seemed like a genuine cop, until he got overly angry about some kids writing their names in the cement and told only Davie to get in the car. Who knew when, or if, Davie would ever get out of that basement. One thing was for sure, Davie would have problems that would become apparent during the film. I almost believed the story that he had to defend himself from a mugger early that one morning, until the news of Katie's death. After that I made a swift judgment that Davie had killed her and started to wonder what would happen to friendship between the three guys. Katie's death did come as a surprise, at first I thought she was going to get away with her boyfriend and the movie would go in a different direction. As soon they found her body in the abandoned bear habitat, I could see so many bad things that could happen in the plot. Some of the stuff that did happen was the fact that Davie kept changing his story, which only made him more suspect. Then Sean wouldn't listen to his partner, Whitey, who first started saying that Dave could be the killer. Since they were childhood friends, Sean's denial that Dave killed Katie only made things worse. It was very sad that Dave kept changing his story and for some reason, couldn't tell the truth. The most predictable part of the movie was when Jimmy got word that Dave might be the killer, and the saddest part was when Celeste told Jimmy she thought Dave was the culprit. She could have gone to Sean, but instead she went to the loose cannon who had done jail time. From then on you knew something bad was going to happen to Dave, and sure enough, Jimmy gets his gang together to interrogate and eventually kill Dave. Just as most of the watchers of this movie Jimmy passed judgment on Dave without looking at good evidence and ended up making a big mistake. Curiously, the movie doesn't end with Dave's death. It goes on to show the aftermath and hints on what might happen to Jimmy, Sean, and their families. I highly recommend this movie if you like films that make you think and have great actors who are completely in their element.",

            "content": "Clint Eastwood is one of the more interesting characters in Hollywood. Few who grew up watching him as Rawhide could have imagined he would make the grim fatalistic western masterpiece \"Unforgiven.\" And now, those who idolized Eastwood as Harry Callahan may be surprised at how he portrays gritty urban life in \"Mystic River.\"From the start it becomes clear that Eastwood intended for \"Mystic River\" to be his best movie, eclipsing even \"Unforgiven.\" Instead of hiring himself out for the title role he got together a troupe of some of the last two decades finest actors: Penn, Fishbourne, Bacon and Robbins. And was then able to ring out of each of them, what could be the finest acting of their careers.Remember Sean Penn in \"State of Grace?\" Bacon in \"Stir of Echoes?\" Fishbourne in \"Deep Cover\" and Robbins in \"Jacob's Ladder?\" Well imagine something even better than all these performances.  As it is Bacon and Fishbourne are hit or miss actors. For every great acting they do they also release a \"Hollow Man\" or \"Event Horizon.\" Their performance in \"Mystic River\" more than makes up for these cinematic failures.The casting in the film is spot on, as though each part were written specifically for these actors.The script itself is worthy of merit too. Based on an equally gripping book, \"Mystic River\" is a compelling story told in a compelling manner. Eastwood doesn't mess around with giving you a hero or a villain. Rather the only main character is the neighborhood itself--shot on site in Boston for great, gritty realism. As the story contstantly jumps from one point of view to the next (the victim, the accused, the cops and everyone inbetween), the movie picks up pace even when it isn't going anywhere--thus throughout the films 2 plus hours there is never a dull moment.Makeup is deserving of note in Mystic River. Especially in the case of Penn, Robbins and Marcia Gay Hayden. Although Penn is recognizable, he looks nothing like you have ever seen him before. This is not Jeff Spiccoli, it is Markham. For Robbins, the makeup artists did a masterful job of putting the weight of forty years of abuse on his cheek bones. After films like \"Absolute Power\" and \"Blood Work\" it seemed like Eastwood was more interested in making fun movies, than great ones. \"Mystic River\" proves that Eastwood is still an artist, and a great one at that.",

            "content": "Mystic RiverSuperb! What a joy! Here we see the finest actors of a generation perfectly cast in a powerful and interesting story that is well told.The premise is simple: three estranged friends who shared a traumatic experience as boys are brought together in unexpected ways by a murder in the old neighbourhood. But in the hands of director Clint Eastwood it becomes a fiercely intense experience driven by complex emotional twists.\nI must admit that I am relatively unfamiliar with Eastwood's efforts behind the camera. If Mystic River is any indication at all of his talents as an auteur he will be going on my list of must sees. Someone has to replace Tarantino in the talent pool.Each scene is a story contained and complete in and of itself. The narrative unfolds gradually and elegantly with each vignette. At 156 minutes the film is exactly as long as it needs to be. A beat more or less would have resulted in discord, asymmetry. One has the feeling that the finished product is exactly what Eastwood wanted; a great achievement in itself.Perhaps it is his long career in front of the camera that allowed the director to garner such performances from his cast. Each member of the inspired triad of Penn, Robbins, and Bacon is allowed to focus on his strengths with little intervention.Robbins is all about eyes. His character's horrifying childhood experience chronically drips from them like icy crocodile tears. Bacon is a body language man, a master of mannerisms that many actors are unable to control when creating character. Sean Penn delivers a grief so terrifying, so absolutely annihilating that it is difficult to remain objective about his performance. This is simply because it isn't a performance. There is a gripping realism and authenticity delivered by all the cast members.\nSubtly written with an astounding attention to detail in dialect, speech mannerisms, and dialog, the same realism so apparent in the performances pervades the entire production to superb and engrossing effect. The community in which this twisted tableaux unfolds is as unique as the characters that inhabit it. It isn't generic America. It is a specific time and a specific place.Mystic River has few flaws but because of the excellence and subtlety of the production over all they tend to stand out a mile. Most glaring is Laura Linney's performance. This is unfortunate as I think she is one of the best actresses of her generation but either she or Eastwood couldn't decide what her character should be. She starts of being a slightly resentful and angry second wife and ends with being some kind of suburban lady Macbeth. The scope of Penn's role also went over the top slightly. There was no need to turn him into the neighbourhood Don to justify his actions.\nOn the whole those are small details. This is an excellent, captivatingly shot film with brilliant performances in front of and behind the camera. It is absorbing with out being intellectual, intense with out being complicated, moving with out being sentimental, visceral with out being violent. Go and see it. It is one of the best films of the decade; the best film of the year.Oh yes: far too good for the pants scale this one is going commando.",

The flick in some points is not bad, meanwhile good, bad the end simplify all in so a dreadful way, that eventually it isn't good. Linney's character should have been extensively enlarged, whereas she is only a \"deus ex machina\". If you resist this moral adjustment (including also the detective) , you can maybe think upon how it is possible that criminals live among us loving their families etc. and upon the devastating consequences of sexual violence (children and women!), but the lot of uncritical praises this movie had earned is a sign of the moral level of our society. In the novel the detective promise to Celeste to pursue the murderer. In the movie this is said in so an ambiguous manner that eventually it is canceled. And this is unforgivable Mr. Eastwood! For this reason, also the outrageous indifference towards the victims will shock you, but only an instant, then you will forget. Eastwood nearly always deals with important topics, that are not often chosen from directors, and he knows his job as filmmaker, but this is a reason more, not to do flick lick this!!!",

And the idea that the mute and his friend did this- if they were going to murder Brendan's girlfriend to keep Brendan home, why not just shoot her? Why beat her? The whole beating thing only makes sense as a ploy to make the audience think it was Dave. A bumbling plot, but good acting. The acting sold the crummy script.

I only knew this guy as a hero of the wild west, an old dusty gun. I had also been told that this movie was not a kid movie. Me, being a kid, didn\u00a1\u00a6t know if I could sit through the whole thing, so I tried to pay attention; I didn't want to get bored of this film that got so many good words about. Surprisingly, I didn't even need to try. It grabbed my interest and held it all the way through. There are three boys, Jimmy, Sean, and Dave, playing hockey outside together, when their ball falls into the sewer. Jimmy comes up with new ideas, like stealing a car and driving it around the block, and writing names in the unhardened sidewalk cement. A man wearing a heavy jacket pulls up in his car. bunch of little punks\u00a8 he says. Dave, who only made out Da on the sidewalk, was told to get in to the car. The three all thought the man was a cop. He wasn't. 4 days locked in a cold cellar with nothing but a sleeping bag, poor Dave had to escape from the child molester. 25 years later, they are all reunited by coincidence. Jimmy is a shop owner with a murdered 19-year old daughter, Katie. Sean Is the police inspector on the case, and Dave is one of the suspects. Brandon is just Ray's\u00a1\u00a8 son. Jimmy had some bad experiences with Just Ray, which cost him time in prison. From then on, he had a grudge against everyone in the family. Brandon happened to be dating Jimmy\u00a1\u00a6s daughter. When Dave came home really late from the local bar with a cut on his stomach and hand, his reputation for crying wolf and scared behavior got his wife, Celeste, very confused as well. I won\u00a1\u00a6t spoil any more for this is a superb movie with such pure and genuine acting by Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, and Kevin Bacon. Almost as if it happened in the real life.

Boyle's neighbors and companions were ignorant, limited people and his conflicted wife was equally as pitiful.

I felt I could really sympathize with Dave, Jimmy and Sean, and their actions seemed believable. There was some implausibility in the movie; namely the extreme coincidence of Dave happening to murder a child molester shortly after running into Jimmy's daughter who herself is murdered that same night. But, I suppose some plot device was needed to shift suspicion to Dave.My main gripe with the film is the ending and its implied message. After Jimmy realizes he has killed an innocent man (of his daughter's murder at least), he is disturbed, and rightly so. However, the film seems to want to justify his actions, highlighted by his wife's speech in which she more or less condones what he did since he was trying to do right by his family. Even his friend, Sean the police detective, seems to accept Jimmy's murderous behavior as OK: hey, Dave was screwed up anyway because of his history with sexual abuse, after all. I don't mind films that end unhappily. I can walk away from them and appreciate the characters' flaws and reflect on their mistakes. But this film seems to want to convince me that murder is OK as long as you meant to kill someone who wronged you, and that some lives aren't really worth that much anyway. And that is a little disturbing. 6 out of 10",

The scene toward the end, in which Laura Linney's character--who hasn't had much to say or do for most of the movie--suddenly morphs into a Boston-accented Lady Macbeth is a good example. It leaves you thinking, \"Where did THAT come from?\" It came out of nowhere, and while the closing scene (SPOILER ALERT) gives you some idea of what it leads to--that the Sean Penn character has become a small-scale Tony Soprano--it's all too typical of the sloppy construction of a movie which somehow wowed the critics.The movie does have its moments. However, none of them involve Penn, who never allows us to forget that he's a Great Actor. Tim Robbins and Marcia Gay Harden, and some of the lesser-known supporting players, disappear into their roles, but Penn contents himself with a mannered star turn. Since he fails to make his character sympathetic--and even a thug who becomes a bereaved parent should elicit some compassion--he leaves a gaping hole in the movie's center.Eastwood has made a great movie about a man whose violent past catches up with him and compels him back into violence to avenge a wrong. That movie was \"Unforgiven,\" to which this one can't compare.",

But instead I found myself more and more immersed into the crime mystery side of the story. Who killed Jimmy's (Penn) daughter? And maybe more importantly: why?That was the good part of the film, its dedication to the old type of crime thrillers (I'm thinking Hitchcock, but then again - I very rarely watch these kinds of films - so I may be WAY off).The BEST part, though, was the actors: Sean Penn is a must-see; also Kevin Bacon gets to do (at long last) a character that actually is mellow and calm!I know Robbins has got some great reviews and don't get me wrong - he also does a great job (as always) - but I can't help feeling that he fails to catch as much depth of character as Penn. If this is because of the script or not I cannot tell, in either case I feel that he is the weakest link in the Penn-Bacon-Robbins-chain, so to speak.But to summarize this little review: Eastwood deserves an applaud for this slow, \"classic\" tale of murder. And those that think the film is too long or too slow or whatever, to you I would like to say: - Just lean back in your chair and enjoy the brilliant acting of the grand trio Penn/Bacon/Robbins. Heck, I'd watch those three for hours on end, if I'd a chance!RATING: 8/10SEAN PENN-RATING: 10/10Check it!",

            "content": "Mystic River was a borderline-brilliant piece of American cinema. The acting performances were nothing less than stellar. Every time Sean Penn entered, as much as I hated it, I felt the pain of his position. Penn was so wonderful I thought the performance was hard to watch, and despite the aggressive nature in the performance, it wasn't overdone at all.  To say he deserves a glance from the Academy is greatly understating what I just witnessed. While the other two male stars are overshadowed by Penn, Bacon and Robbins's work in Mystic River should not be shrugged off. You can really feel for Bacon, although his character is well-distanced from the current murder, the dealings with his silent, estranged wife gives more dimensions that the veteran Bacon is easily able to handle; and does. While Robbins at times seems a little contrived, the audience doesn't know whether to sympathize or fear this man that has a continual pile of evidence overshadowing any semblance of innocence he has left. I remember one specific seen when Dave(Robbins) is being interrogated and asks Sean(Bacon) for a Sprite. Everyone in the theater laughed, it was funny, but the look Robbins gave sent chills through me. Other notable performances were Marcia Gay Harden as the housewife struggling with her loyalty to her husband, and the near obviousness of Dave being a murderer. And Tom Guiry, the boy whom I haven't seen since The Sandlot, delivers a heart-wrenching performance as the dead Katie's fiancee.While Clint Eastwood seemed to do comparably less work than in his previous projects, it worked perfectly. The largely uncomplicated shot work did wonders to bring out the glamor-void in working-class Boston. And on occasion, Eastwood throws in a shot that would blindside the viewer (overhead shot of Penn in the middle of police after learning of his daughter).The only thing saving this movie from being completely brilliant is the ending. Without giving it away I would just like to say this: I wish Helgeland would have expanded on why exactly it was done. I thought the reasoning was a little weak.Mystic River is a wonderful movie thankfully set in parts other than what we've usually come to expect (NY, LA, Space). And the incredible actor-driven film will force moviegoers to listen intently to the wonderful banter and not blankly stare at large explosions. If you have spare time, and even if you don't, Mystic River is well-worth the price of admission.",

And I emphasize MAJOR!  In the book Dave is tormented with the fact that he has improper inclinations and thoughts about young boys, but has never acted on this.  He does have a split personality, reference to \"the Boy\", but in my opinion the movie does not make this clear like the book does.  When Jimmy is pointing the gun at Dave at the end and asking him if he killed his daughter and why he had the blood, etc.  Dave tries to explain about the man and young boy,which does not make sense to Jimmy. Dave cannot bring himself to tell Jimmy why he killed that man.  He cannot bring himself to tell Jimmy that he has these thoughts about young boys, therefore he would rather admit to a murder he didn't commit than admit to his feelings about young boys. Dave's character is developed beautifully in the book...you can actually feel his pain and anguish.  It is truly heartbreaking to read it.As far as the parade scene goes, I think that Sean fully intends to go after Jimmy, that is why the trigger finger.  In the book Celeste goes up to Sean and says, \"You know that Jimmy killed my husband\", and Sean replies that he does and if it takes him the rest of his life he will try to prove it... or something on those lines.  Why they left out this important information in the movie is beyond me.  In my opinion those 2 lines were very important. Annabeth's speech and the way she looked at Celeste at the parade scene were not part of the way the book ended.  Hope this helps!",

The film follows three childhood friends, played by Bacon, Penn, and Robins, whose lives are splinter into three seperate paths due to trauma that occurs to one of them.Eastwood follows these paths up to the present as Jimmy (Penn) runs a neighborhood grocery, Sean (Bacon) is a police officer, and Jimmy (Robbins) walks the streets a shell of a man.  The three estranged friends are again brought together when aditional tragedy strikes.Eastwood is clearly a Hollywood traditionalist, giving these characters a chance to breathe rare in cinema today.  The cast is particularly excellent and Penn's work will probably be remembered at Oscar time.  Although, at times Robbin's accent and mannerism do become trying (particularly to those native from the often misrepresented Boston area, shame on you Rob Morrow and Kevin Costner)While the film is clearly a rank above recent Eastwood efforts such as \"Blood Work\" it does not reach the heights of his masterful Unforgiven. Parts of the script feel overwritten and heavy handed, as characters seem to be spelling out themes instead of letting the audience come to them on their own.  Also, the film is fat, and would benefit from 20 minutes or so of trimming, particularly at the multiple finale riddled ending.Overall, though, we must appreciate a talent like Eastwood as he clearly stands for an era of old fashioned filmmaking.  While not quite the classic it strives to be, it is worthwhile nonetheless.",

            "content": "A simple plot here, the easiest thing to \"get\".  The movie opens with childhood friends Jimmy (Penn), Dave (Robbins), and Sean (Bacon) having the course of their lives change right before their eyes as one of them (Dave) is more or less forced into the car of an assumed sexual offender.  The story then picks up many years later and everything comes to a head when Jimmy's daughter is brutally murdered, which brings back bad memories back for everybody, while Sean and partner Whitey (Fishburne) have to get to the bottom of it all.As said, the plot isn't too complicated and there are even a few holes one could point out in the story, but all of that is merely secondary. Eastwood and company focus more on the themes of murder (as advertised in the original trailer), justice, vengeance, and of course the multi-layered characters.  Many fault the movie for the \"weak\" plot, but these people are missing the entire point of why this movie was made.  Mystic River gives you just enough story and lets the characters do their work and do it well. The result is an emotional barrage that takes the mature viewer places they never expected or maybe never wanted to go.The acting is of course the strong point and this may be the best ensemble cast anywhere.  Penn plays the emotionally charged Jimmy so well, in that you can feel how broken up he is about his daughter, and just see the sorrow in his face, while in another moment he can be downright menacing - the saying 'if looks could kill' coming to mind.  Penn makes the switch between \"sides\" so naturally and believably, he deserves any accolades and praise coming his way (I hear he won the Oscar).  Robbins much to my surprise was just as good as Penn, if not better.  You see the pain in his eyes and in his walk, but at the same time are upset because his character portrays that of a liar many times in the film, making you unsure of whether you want to see good or bad done to him.  Bacon is the least featured of the three, but he plays his role very well considering what's given to him.  Marcia Gay Harden and Laura Linney are very good too, neither Oscar worthy, but one to keep your eye on might be Tom Guiry, who played the boyfriend of Jimmy's daughter.  Guiry was very much engrossed in his character like Penn and Robbins were into theirs, which is saying something. Fishburne's part was so small that I nearly forget him, though he does his job fine, like Bacon.The themes and symbolism here will probably make this one to re-watch for years to come.  For instance, when you find out about one of the culprits in particular it all comes together, as he bore a resemblance to Dave, and by coincidence or not ended up being the bearer of penance to Jimmy for all his sins.  Or going back to the theme of murder, and how ironic it was to see Brendan (Guiry) become as chilling as Jimmy as the result of both losing the same person.  The ending with Linney was controversial, but perfectly in context I thought.  Her speech hammers the themes touched on throughout and makes you ask questions.  Was it really bad for Jimmy's wife to feel this way after not only going through the trauma, but after the viewer at one point surely wanting vengeance too?  Would it be that \"evil\" of a speech if Dave really did do it?  Why or why not?  Dozens more examples and questions could be raised from this masterpiece.Eastwood's directing is impressive, as he never judges the characters, and instead leaves that up to you.  Clint's objective viewpoint works, considering the moral dilemmas brought up, but even so, it isn't quite Oscar-worthy.  As beautifully shot as Unforgiven though.If there is one fault however, it is the pacing of the movie, which at one point, gets very, very slow.  While the plot itself takes a backseat, and the slow build makes sense for the gradual change with everyone involved, one just can't help but feel that Mystic River would've benefited from a slice here or there.  But a patient person that understands this movie will not find it to be that much of a problem.  Highly recommended.  9 or 10/10I also recommend Taxi Driver (10/10) if you liked this, as it's in the same vein, and also American Psycho (7/10) to a degree - though opinions on the latter are more varied, plus it's more of a dark satire in comparison.",

Every element was understated. The simplicity of the plot. The way the past is never truly dead evoked the shadow of Shakespeare and the fact that we the audience knew that Robbins was doomed -- even before he was abducted.

            "content": "...having been a virgin to Eastwood's work behind the camera and hearing incredible things about this movie, I was anticipating my viewing of this film very much. What I got was an average thriller, with an exceptional cast, ALL of whom failed to deliver the performances they are capable of.I mean seriously. Sean Penn won an Oscar for this, when he made 21 Grams in the same year? What the hell is that about? Tim Robbins didn't convince me. It took me a good half an hour to pick up on the fact that his character was supposed to be a bit 'slow' and there were no subtleties in his physical stance to indicate this. Kevin Bacon and Laurence Fishburne gave standard good cop/bad cop routine acting, but neither reached the potential that they've shown in other movies. Marcia Gay Harden is an actress that I find tolerable at best normally - but in this movie her face had the same expression in nearly every scene, particularly the first half. It was like 'Oh I'm a bit confused'... and a few minutes later 'Yep... still confused'. On the contrary, Laura Linney is an actress that I have the hugest respect and admiration for, not least because I feel she is without a doubt the most IMPROVED actress in our current climate (check out her performance in 'Primal Fear' and then compare it to her performances in 'You Can Count On Me' or 'Love, Actually' to see what I mean). However, Linney is underused completely - and at the end she is given a big scene to do that you think might lead onto something bigger but.... no. It's nothing.I blame the acting on the director. When you get a group of consistently good actors (Marcia Gay Harden excepted, in my meek opinion) and put them together there should be some magic there. But there's no spark from a single one of them in my eyes. Todd Field's directing of his actors in 'In The Bedroom' three years ago, managed to get some incredibly drawn performances from Sissy Spacek, Tom Wilkinson and Marisa Tomei that are not even gone near in this movie. And it's all Clint Eastwood's fault.The story itself is so generic it's not even worth going into. Girl is killed. A few of the characters are suspects. The murder is resolved, with a bit of a bitter aftertaste, for certain reasons that I won't state here.The resolution in particular is very messy. The movie seems to be searching for a place to end for the last couple of minutes... we get silly shots of Harden and Linney's eyes meeting followed by Penn and Bacon's eyes meeting... and it all feels painfully contrived as a way to end the movie, but without knowing how to.I had been looking forward to this movie in a big way. It was seen as one of the three 'serious drama' movies at the 2004 Academy Awards, but in my opinion both '21 Grams' and 'House Of San & Fog' stand miles above it.",

This movie could have been in league with many other psychological crime thrillers of its genre such as \"Se7en\" and \"Memento\" if it had not completely butchered the ending in a completely anti-climactic and movie destroying sequence. **SPOILERS***Here is what I believe should have occurred, as opposed to the despicable Laura Linney brainwashing Jimmy into falling in love with his Alpha-Male stature. As happens in the movie, Jimmy interrogates Dave as he kneels next to the Mystic River and simultaneously Sean discovers who the girls \"real\" killer is. The scenes cut between each other, and Sean is held at gunpoint. He tries to coax the kid out of shooting, and Jimmy gets more and more crazy at Dave. The scene escalates dramatically, and the cutting scenes portray that at the same time Jimmy stabs Dave (A satisfying climax the movie boasted before it went downhill), Sean is shot in the chest by the kid and collapses. Everything else between Jimmy and Dave happens exactly the same. Later, Jimmy hears of Sean's injury, and visits him at the hospital. Sean tells Jimmy that they caught the killer and the two have roughly the same conversation they did in the real movie in the middle of the street. Sean (clearly fading out) says to Jimmy (who sobs realizing what he has done to innocent Dave) \"Sometimes I feel like we all got in the back of that car that day\", a great line in the movie. Sean dies in front of Jimmy. The movie profiles Jimmy going home, doing his business, and in this horrifying, almost-Shakespearean tragedy of an ending, Jimmy kills himself in some way, ending the life of the last of the three boys that were affected that fateful day in the opening scene. Who agrees with this ? This movie would have been a beautiful movie if it had any other end than it did. It was, however, ruined and therefore I only give it a 5.",

Sean Penn, Kevin Bacon and Tim Robbins are as good as ever but also Marcia Gay Harden who plays celeste. Without her the Robbins character would have been unbelievable. I mean he would have been institutionalised way before this story took place. But by meeting her he could probably cope. They have very similar personalities.

Knowing that the molester was found after Jimmy kills him gives Boyle integrity and truthfulness, and we have sympathy for him. Jimmy is sympathized for during the middle majority of the film, until the scene of Dave's death, in which we feel hatred for him. Interestingly, there is a hint of sympathy left for Jimmy once we learn that he killed the wrong man. The audience doesn't, and didn't want Jimmy to do evil things, but it is in the foundation of Jimmy's character: he is a vengeful person who uses violence as a means to achieve this revenge.

Sean Penn and Tim Robbins create outstanding moments, Including Penn's \"Is that my daughter\" scene and Tim's \"Vampire, sweetie. Werewolf\". When we think about what other people think, what actually happening there is \"we think about what we thinking\"The film centers on the three friends: Jimmy (Sean Penn), an ex-con who now runs the corner store; Dave (Tim Robbins), a handyman, and Sean (Kevin Bacon), a homicide detective. All are married; Jimmy to a second wife, Annabeth (Laura Linney), who helps him bring up his oldest daughter and two of their own; Dave to Celeste (Marcia Gay Harden), who has given him a son; Sean to an absent, pregnant wife who calls him from time to time but never says anything. To see strong acting like this is exhilarating. In a time of flashy directors who slice and dice their films in a dizzy editing rhythm, it is important to remember that films can look and listen and attentively sympathize with their characters.

The entire premise of the movie is that a young girl is brutally murdered. Though shot, the cause of death is repeated blows to the head from a blunt object, likely a stick or a pipe. An early scene in the movie tells the astute viewer who the killer is. The murder weapon is further prominently featured elsewhere in the movie, only in a different incarnation, and with great irony. Only when the murderer is finally revealed does the viewer see how he has been inattentive. Such is the stuff of true compelling mystery.Another feature of the movie is it's moral: the hideousness and moral self-imprisonment of vigilante justice. At the end of the movie, a fair viewer acknowledges the absolute necessity of having and trusting a judicial system, even one as flawed as our own.Sean Penn is especially effective in the role of Jimmy. He is another of those great actors shamefully underused by Hollywood. He makes the viewer feel his anguish, and though his actions are appalling, we still feel empathy for him, and he emerges as a kind of anti-hero in spite of himself.Once again, Clint Eastwood has demonstrated that he is as good behind the camera as in front. The story is well developed, and the cinematography captures the essence of life in the neighbourhoods of New York: though all the streets lead out of the city, nobody is able to escape them, or the past they constantly thrust into in the minds of their prisoners. One critical note: I thought the sound quality was poor. Far too often I could not make out what the characters were saying. When using New York accents, it is essential that the director ensure crisp, sharp sound. I didn't realize the kids were reporting that there was \"blood in a car\" and not \"blood on a cop\" until much later in the movie. Overall, I highly recommend this movie.",

            "review_title": "Eastwood's Masterpiece: Mystic River is already a drama classic!",
            "content": "Whatever it is that makes Clint Eastwood brilliant as a director it's once and for all epitomized in 'Mystic River'. Clint Eastwood accomplishes the most difficult and for most unattainable feats of a world class director with this movie that will always remain one of his best. First of all, he maintains a sober undramatic and straightforward direction (characteristic of him) while still covering and closely portraying the whole range of human emotion (and we're really talking the WHOLE range of emotion here). Secondly he manages to capture the most complex psychological condition in a single, simply filmed scene, sometimes even in a single shot (a particular scene with Tim Robbins as the formidably driving force behind it springs to mind, a scene that still gives me the creeps just thinking about it).Thirdly, he's able to maintain an almost Hitchcockian suspense throughout the movie while at the same time patiently conducting the story, not rushing anything, letting the tragic and dramatic events unfold themselves naturally, at the same time inevitably and therefore painfully, but never forcing any part of the plot. The movie keeps you at the edge of your seat, it keeps you curious, sometimes afraid of what's gonna happen, it absorbs you completely and involves you in what's happening (at least it did all these things for me). The main reason for that, imo, is the last and strongest feat of this movie: the performances.Eastwood has proved himself one of those exceptional directors that can tickle the best possible performances out of his actors and all of the performances in this movie are unanimously phenomenal (2 Oscars for leading and supporting actor)! Of course Sean Penn stands out\u0085he's the leading man and Jesus what the f**k a leading man he is! As a father who loses his daughter in the most brutal way, who is unable to cope with the pain and is (ultimately) manically driven into avenging his daughter's death, Eastwood and Brian Helgeland (the screenwriter, story based on the novel by Dennis Lehane) provide Penn with the emotionally vast landscape wherein he can unleash his terrifyingly exceptional abilities as an actor. Penn has been an acting phenomenon for some time now, however this movie comes closer to an apotheosis of him as a character actor than any other of his previous performances (and yes, 'I am Sam' and 'Sweet and Lowdown', among other over-the-top performances, are considered; '21 grams' and the again Oscar-winning performance in 'Milk', both equally fantastic, came after 'Mystic River'). Penn aside however, all other actors are presenting one of their best work here; Tim Robbins (won the Oscar for best supporting actor, Penn won for leading actor) is I think the secret star of the show; while the brilliance of Penn's performance is savagely hitting you in the face with every scene he's in, Robbins's acting is, in accordance with his character, very subtle and silent, yet powerful in his understatement; however, there are scenes where the character is unveiling something deeply hidden, is revealing his innermost psychic self, and Robbins's sudden intensity and abruptly exploding mania in those scenes is unmatchable by anything he has done before. It may seem tedious to name all other actors that give their expected brilliant performances or, in most cases, surpass all previous ones, still it must be stressed, Marcia Gay Harden, Laura Linney, Kevin Bacon and Laurence Fishburne are all doing a top-notch job; Harden particularly is involved in some extremely emotionally difficult scenes; Laura Linney is 'outing' herself as one of the most diabolic characters of the movie in one of the very last scenes of the film, a last twist that turns another character into an ambiguous construction in a movie so emotionally and psychologically complex. Which brings us to the mastermind behind this picture, Clint Eastwood. Without overcomplimenting or saying too much, the guy who as an actor paradigmatically incorporated the stiff tongued, steely eyed, cold blooded badass has, for his relatively new role as a director, extracted a soberness and clarity from his previous actor persona when he chose to delve into the most difficult emotional and psychological situations imaginable. This is why his movies work. Nothing is overstretched or exaggerated; everything's kept simple, direct, and therefore effective and striking. There are scenes in this movie you won't forget due to several factors: the suspense that almost every scene is electrically charged with, the gripping storyline, the exceptional acting performances, and the brutal immediateness with which every scene hits you all work together to make 'Mystic River' a modern masterpiece of drama cinema.",

In the kitchen after his daughter's funeral, Jimmy Markham (Sean Penn) converses with his father-in-law in a remarkably naturalistic way, showing anger and sadness without overdoing a single note of his tone, and timing his responses perfectly. Of course Clint Eastwood's skilful directing has much to do with this seamless weaving together of narrative scenes. Thought the plot poses a question mark for the audience at the end regarding the motive of the murderer, this can be largely overlooked by the masterful interplay of three or four main themes.  This is a grand philosophical thriller of the highest order.",

            "content": "The most engaging, and, at the same time estranging aspect of Mystic River is (SPOILER ALERT!! FOR THE LOVE OF GOD TAKE HEED!) the responsiblity taken, or not taken by the characters.  Jimmy, in the end, sees his murder of Dave as necessary, and up to that point our empathy of his plight is centered around the fact that he is the father of a murdered child.  In the final frame, I hate him.  He has created the child of a murdered father, and he takes no responsiblity for the act itself.  Dave, on the other hand, takes responsiblity, not just in the death he suffers, but in the guilt of the crime that invited it, a crime he did not in fact commit.  But commit a crime he did, although the punishment he suffers comes across as undeserved and tragic.  Sean will or will not harbor the truth, perhaps as long as his life remains intact. My point is that the movie took us there in such a way that I forgot I was watching a mystery.  At one point I began to know the truth just as the clues would have me do so, and had to wonder if the film wanted me to or not.  To me, this is the most provacative way in which Mystic River turns the formula for classic story structure on it's ear, and explains why Eastwood felt that this was such an important film to make.  I can see why he insisted on Boston itself for shooting location instead of Toronto, so he might capture the feel and look of an almost royal court of family secrets, blood and lies, a ground littered with the buried bodies that these families are sworn to protect.  A masterpiece indeed.",

            "content": "I'm not sure how this film got its critical acclaim; maybe it's because of the names that were involved.  But it's inescapable that MYSTIC RIVER has problems.There are character problems.  No character truly undergoes any kind of significant development; they deserve our pity, but not our empathy. Bacon's character is too middle-of-the-road to associate with, although the audience should associate with him the most -- he's trying to figure out the murder.  Fishburne's character is a mere necessity of plot.  Penn's character, while the deepest in the movie, disappoints in the end -- he's weaker than we're led to believe.  Linney is hardly in the movie, but then is shown to be the supreme motivating force -- how did that get past draft one?There are casting problems.  Bacon and Fishburne are too conspicuous to be in their roles, and Robbins doesn't pull off the Boston accent well. Granted, Penn is great in this flick, as always (I consider him to be one of the best around), but it's not enough to carry the entire movie.There are theme problems.  Clint, you hammer us over the head with things that should be subtle!  Case in point -- the vampire scene.  Robbins is watching a vampire movie and launches into a tirade about how he's a vampire.  There's nothing artistic about it!  The cross on the abductor's ring, and the cross on Penn's back.  The communion against the murder (come on, we've seen this before in the greatest movie of all time -- talk about cliche).It's terrible when you see a film and you feel that something great is there.  There's so much talent -- but even the greatest talent can't overcome a story poorly adapted for the screen.  There is so much that can be done with a story so powerful, but Clint didn't do it for me with this one.",

I think it's fair to say that he has his share of responsibility for the great performances in Mystic River. For sure he was never an outstanding actor, but he was convincing and charismatic. I think that helped him to deal with actors.Unlikely many, I think the plot is quite good. And I also like the way the story was told. The murder itself is not the major motto of the film. In my opinion, the idea that someone has to pay, no matter who, is the great inspiration of the movie.SPOILEROne of the problems in Mystic River is the betrayal of Robbins's wife. It's very strange, to say the least, that since she has been married for over ten years, she still doesn't know her husband. May be in the Dennis Lehane's novel, which the movie is based on, there are some elements that explain her reaction.",

This simple crime story develops into a Shakespearian drama which makes the mindful viewer question their own silences. The discussion with my friend ranged from literary allusions to early American New England writers like Cooper and Hawthorne to the questionable ethics of P.T. Barnum in the Jacksonian era to the silence that enable the rise of Fascism in pre-WWII Germany.

Bankrupt and tragic vengeance, since at the end he/she is proved that he/she was not the murderer, but some boys smaller than age of the neighborhood. In this final scene she tells to the hearing to \"Your you are the King and the King makes what has to make to defend his castle.\" What has to make to coast of making a mistake, to defend the dream of their daughters, at the hour that is, even yes it was the 3 a.m. In this alone image of the daily tragedy of Clint Eastwood, I see colored to United States, or maybe to a fragment of the American idiosyncrasy, a family portrait that discover the cultural background of United States today in day. It doesn't care yes it is necessary to propitiate the ruin of Baghdad and Iraq occupying it in the \"enemies' of the democracy search and the freedom\" looking for chemical or nuclear weapons that existed never, or making the same thing in Afghanistan, without finding Osama Bin Laden for any side. It doesn't care yes we kill mistakenly one of our childhood friends, to charge the blood of one of our children, it doesn't care, because we are the kings and we have to take this type of decisions to defend our tranquility or our honor, serious rather.As well as there are skeletons in the closets, there are also other hidden ones in the rivers of the memory, as that of Dave Boyle, (Tim Robbins) the friend that is drowned mistakenly in the Mistic River. This drowned man, once violated by policemen in their childhood, it is the it kills of the indifference, from their first years until their death. It is the it kills of that of that that nobody charge is taken in the society. It kills her it finishes stigmatized to the point of even becoming something dispensable or unnecessary, as much as to obviate their crime for another of their friends, the Detective of Homicides, be I Became (Kevin Bacon) and to leave it hidden in the river.In the international politics the same one happens to Iraq or with Afghanistan. The king in turn, (be Penn) he/she is the American Government. The dead of a river of a district of Boston turn out to be the faithful portrait of the American position, in the world.

This movie really came across as one that makes you think the book must have been great.  All the little inconsistencies you guys have reported were probably all explained in really clear detail in the book, and maybe in the movie too til they were edited out or something.  So, if you had problems with the final product, I say blame the editing or the scriptwriter. For the record, they did say the trunk blood was O, and that the girl was O, but Brendan did not hear the 911 tape in the movie so who knows why he thought his bro could talk.  He probably had the gun hidden in the ceiling because it was the one \"manly\" thing of his dad's that was still around, and as the oldest, he was now the \"man\", and probably keeping it in case he had to protect the family or something like that, again probably all spelled out in the book.  I don't think he ever thought of his bro doing it until he saw the gun was gone. As for Dave, he already said there were so many things he wanted to set straight with his wife & son, his fried brain was probably just wanting some way to get out of there and back to them, so he said yes. Jimmy was crazy from the grief trauma, and used to being a man of action. He thought his \"going straight\" was a contributing factor to his daughter's death, never put two and two together to see that his perpetuating Just Ray's life with those checks was warping Ray's kids somehow.  Now that he takes action again, he messes up again.  My date said how could Sean let him go, but I don't think he will (see the shooting motion he makes at the parade), just waiting for the evidence that Dave's dead to make its appearance.  Jimmy's confession with out rights read would never hold up, and they have no other evidence yet. I thought Laura Linney was a good mafia-wife type character.  Cool as ice. I liked MGHarden better in Space Cowboys, this character was too weak (I don't mean the depicting, I mean the actual character), like Annabeth sez. Maybe I just like the actress enough I hate to see her play such a hysterical wimp.  And I would have liked to know the original molesters got a stronger come-uppance than they talked about...",

Three childhood friends are torn apart by an unspeakable act and in adulthood are brought back together by an even more heinous event. The score was beautifully placed in key parts of the film. Eastwood's direction and fast pacing of the film was executed masterfully. The acting pure and simple surpassed Oscar worthiness. Each character was three-dimensional and at times you didn't know whom you felt for most. The entire movie was focused and tied everything in perfectly. The chemistry of the actors bounced out of the screen and into viewers' hearts and souls.

            "content": "There are some films that come along every year that change the way that cinema is seen. For the five pictures nominated for Best Picture in 2003, there was one that stood out to me as clearly the best. It was Clint Eastwood's film about the Dennis Lehane novel which shows working class Boston at it's dirtiest. Mystic River secured nominations for Best Actor (Sean Penn), Best Supporting Actor (Tim Robbins), Best Supporting Actress (Marcia Gay Harden), Best Director (Eastwood), and Best Picture. The film is about three childhood friends: Jimmy Markum (Penn), Dave Boyle (Robbins), and Sean Devine (Kevin Bacon) who were friends during childhood until Dave was abducted by pedophiles. The three go their separate ways: Jimmy becomes a criminal who, after released from prison, goes straight and runs a store and has a wife Annabeth (Laura Linney) and two daughters along with Katie (Emmy Rossum). Dave married Celeste (Harden) and they have a son but Dave still carries the tortured seal of his past. Sean is a detective who's wife has left with his infant daughter. The story picks up pace when Katie is murdered and Dave becomes the main suspect. For fans of Penn and Robbins, this film was a real treat. If people still feel that one or the other shouldn't have won the Oscar just look at specific scenes. Penn, for example, is at his best when he finds his daughter is killed in the zoo and he has to be held back. Dave, meanwhile, has one great scene with Celeste where he talks about vampires and the soul and you're almost at the point of crying. This film was the best of 2003 but's it a shame that it was released in the same year as The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. It'll forever be overshadowed.",

The directing of the scene with suddenly joining a parade, while we are left with questions and emotions of injustice, was unbearable. I kept asking myself,what was the whole point of the parade?  Was it supposed to make me feel that there is a positive ending ?  The audience doesn't feel like there is a reason for the injustice of Kevin Bacon doing Sean Penn a favour.Bacon is set up as a cop who wants to do the right thing, that is the whole purpose of the patching up with his estranged wife.  However, if you think about it, what was the point of his wife anyway?  being silent, and obscure? It throws off the audience in thinking there is so much more to his character and his wife that meets the eye.  The wife had NO impact on the story whatsoever. And shakespearean comforting wife ( Sean Penn's wife ) was OUT OF LEFT FIELD ! what can I say?  That was incredibly disappointing, so much so that it was disappointing while the scene unfolded.  It would have been more satisfying if Sean Penn's wife had a purpose to her action, but there is none, other than to better herself by having a strong husband.As mentioned below, how believable and ambiguous were the two possible scene of the crime ?  The first reason for the murder was possible, however the second one that Kevin Bacon explained is impossible, since it would be TOO much of a coincidence, that the brother had an issue, and that they were playing with a gun that just so happened to..Also Robbins' wife telling the story to the person who would most likely kill Dave, instead of going straight to the cops.  What can go through her mind ?  ( I hope he will just talk to Dave and resolve the issue , and not blow his brains out , and I love him thats why im arousing suspicion and basically signing his death warrant! )Only because Penn gives an oscar performance, was the pain believable. However, setting the tone with a scene with father/daughter for 3 minutes is not enough to make the audience feel sympathetic toward the character. Simply put, it could have been done a lot better, and that is one of the major things that lacks in this movie.I felt this movie was good, because there arent any other good movies out lately.  Also, I just wanted to point out the flaws of the movie because most people only base movies on emotions, and not direction or story telling.  Bottom line is that if the script was patched up, and the directing of the ending redone, this would have definitely been one of the more memorable movies for me.",

Even Kevin Bacon as the old friend/investigator did so much to make his character appealing and real.I read somewhere that Clint Eastwood's style of direction is to let things happen.  Only a director of his stature and intelligence along with the highly gifted cast of characters could make this film really come alive.This film is multi-layered.  The coincidence of Dave being blamed for the murder of Jimmy's daughter, when in actuality he is pummeling an active pedophile, keeps all on edge.  The ending is a surprise, because we forget he did NOT kill this girl.  Marcia Gay Harding is a really nervous, upset and suspicious wife. I wanted to strangle her at times because after all Dave went through, he ended up with a wimp wife.This is a film you don't forget.

He played a character not so different from 95% of the roles he plays. Pretty stereotypical role for him - angry, bad guy. So what's new? Robbins played the quiet, nervous, edgy guy - I think he's played that part before. I don't think any of the actors really went farther than giving a good solid performance. Isn't that the reason for Academy Award nominations? Just about worth the $ 2.50 it cost me to rent it. Certainly not worth the $ 8 or $9 some people opted to pay to go to the theater.",

It had several nominations to itself and bagged the Oscars for 'Actor in a leading role (Sean Penn)' and Actor in a supporting role (Tim Robbins)'. I was also curious about Clint Eastwoods directing.But this film was a major disappointment. It took off well at the beginning getting you all exited for a grim tale tackling issues on child sexual molestation, tragedy later in life, coming to terms with reality and injustice. But the story starts to crumble somewhere in the middle as it starts to lose realism. The plot itself loses its surprise factor with nothing to look forward to.It also seems as if the movie was missing several scenes explaining the background of the characters leaving us unable to relate to them. From here on the story skips and staggers to its totally absurd ending (see it yourself). Too bad this movie could have been so much more if the script was slightly realistic and the characters (played by a good cast) were given enough exposure.Speaking of the cast, I did not see good performances by any and I think the two awards that it won should have definitely gone to people like Bill Murray or Johny Depp for Best actor and Ken Watanabe for supporting actor in their respective films.Mystic River was also highly overrated by the Academy (and IMDb), but do go on and watch this film.

Instead of using cgi, a bunch of tricky editing stuff, and fancy camera work - all of which is good, by the way - Eastwood simply became a minimalist. Returning to his style in Unforgiven, Eastwood used an outdated (and now radical approach) to the film, he did very little.  Mystic River was done in a simple fashion and worked beautifully. The acting was perfect.  Tim Robbins, Sean Penn, and Kevin Bacon were all perfect in this film.  Marcia Gay Hadren and Laura Linney were wonderful as well, as was Fishburne. I think that is what I enjoyed most about this movie.  The acting and the actors made it all work and the film is a radical departure from the never ending list of fancy special effects film that keep coming out of Hollywood these days.  While effects are fine, they often come at the expense of story lines (look at what has happened to Bond movies lately).",

            "content": "Overall I found this movie dark, gripping and intense.The viewer becomes not so much involved as entangled with the characters as layer upon layer of ironic tragedy and events past and present saturate their lives, thoughts and decisions.The folding-out of the story is at first a little too fragmented, but soon levels out with a well controlled build-up. Unfortunately, concerning the \"murder mystery\" aspect it was disappointingly predictable from the outset that Dave was not responsible for Jimmy's daughter's death- thus, for me at least, ruling out the much talked about \"twist\" that he did not in fact commit the murder. And the real culprits? A rather mixed-up and unrealistic scenario there.One subtle irony I did appreciate was the apparently inexplicable discomfort Jimmy feels near the beginning of the film when Brendan's mute brother comes into the shop tapping his hockey stick up and down- the hockey stick which we later discover was used to beat Jimmy's dead daughter. When Sean later mentions the role of the hockey stick to Jimmy, I believe it is only at this particular moment that Jimmy  realizes Sean's conclusion is right- it fits with his earlier uneasy intuition- and that he has shockingly and wrongfully murdered his friend.One other interesting irony occurs when Jimmy says to his dead daughter that he knows \"in his soul\" he was himself partly responsible for her death. I feel divine retribution is hinted at in a noir way by the fact the child of a man he killed ends up killing his own child?Despite some flaws (including the ambiguous and unsatisfactory ending)I did enjoy the brooding and tense film work, locations and acting. No it wasn't Sean Penn's best effort- the crying scene on the porch with Dave was a little painful to watch- but otherwise he did well as the hardened, grieving and revengeful mobster. Tim Robbins gave possibly the best performance- the pain he carried in his face was palpable even without words or flash-backs; and Kevin Bacon gave a typical Bacon performance, rather tongue-in-cheek although offering a lighter, and thereby somewhat welcome contrast to the weightiness of the other characters.",

The view of the Mystic River bridge in the background is one that I have seen quite often growing up in this area.My only real problem with the overall premise of the film is the way that the scrutiny seemed to turn so easily to Tim Robbins' character. Though something horrible had obviously happened, there was no evidence tying the girl to his car (she was found in a ditch close to her own car). There were two blood types found on his car, one of which may have been hers, but there was no reason to think that her body had been driven anywhere. He did not have a gun (she was found shot). He had a gash across his stomach (she was out partying with her friends, not hanging out on a street corner wielding a knife). He had somehow damaged his hand and yet her body had not been mauled. Simply pulling a trigger would have done none of this to him.In addition, Sean Penn didn't simply fly off the handle, overwhelmed with the fact that his daughter had been killed, thereby killing Robbins. He had plenty of time to consider the inconsistencies noted above. If Robbins had been known for killing/raping/attacking anyone previously, particularly young women, these conclusions would have been more believable. Yet Robbins had none of those traits.",

Sean Penn is very impressive as the dramatic father of a young woman was recently met by foul play. Penn's character has a checkered past, much like Penn does himself. I have always respected Penn as an actor but this performance is probably his best ever. Tim Robbins is perfect as the worn down Dave Boyle. Robbins may seem stale and emotionless to some in this part, but that was exactly what he was going for, as his character has those traits. Robbins may have even out done Penn, but as Penn was the lead, he received most credit. The investigating detective is meekly played by Kevin Bacon. Although Bacon does not shine in this film, he is good enough, and interacts well with his co-stars. The remaining supporters are nearly spotless in their roles, namely Fishburne, who portrays Bacon's partner. The only knocks against this film are its run-time, and its seemingly 'double' ending. This film raises the question of which is more important, good acting or good directing? Well, this film certainly has both and it's clever exciting edge clearly displays this fact.",

            "review_title": "A beyond -ingenious- critique on religion... using the \"Three Wise Men\"!",
            "content": "I'm just getting into Eastwood films; I have no bias whatsoever. I did notice the crucifix/religious motif throughout the film, and started to assess its significance. Upon a quick Google search, it can be confirmed that Clint Eastwood is \"on the fence\" about religion. In fact, he says himself: \"I couldn't believe that God would be a great sadist in the sky, getting pleasure out of, 'If you screw up, I'm going to bust you, boy'. That's a way of keeping people in line, I guess\".There were three friends in this story. Immediately, the biblical story of \"The Three Wise Men\" came into mind. I started to play around with the idea, and made a gargantuan of a discovery. At the end of the story, Jimmy (Sean Penn)'s wife dubs Jimmy as a \"king\". In the tale of The Three Wise Men, there is a king named King Herod. This represents Jimmy. Now, this is Jimmy's second wife. The second wife of King Herod was Mariamne I. Mariamne I had 4 children: two sons, Alexandros and Aristobulus (executed in 7 BCE), and two daughters, Salampsio and Cypros. How many daughters did Jimmy's wife have with Jimmy in the movie? Jimmy quotes: \"we got two girls waiting at home wondering where their sister is\".The tale of \"The Three Wise Men\" takes place when Jesus was born. Jimmy's daughter will represent Jesus. Though \"three men\" are involved in the story, the Bible doesn't state that there were exclusively three. Following this reasoning, the 3(+) men will represent the officers and detectives at the crime scene.In the Bible, these men meet with the King Herod, in an attempt to locate baby Jesus for the king's worship. They didn't know where he was, but they planned to find him by following a star \"in the east\". This is why there are so many upward shots of the sky in the film. Where does the setting take place? In Massachusetts; the east! In the film, after the detectives briefly met with Jimmy, they leave to find \"the baby\" --- Jimmy's daughter.When the wise men finally find baby Jesus, they withhold this information from King Herod. Initially, in the movie, the officers and detectives did just that. But why was this information held from Herod in the biblical story? Herod feared that the baby would become better than him. The wise men didn't want the baby to be harmed. Note that Jimmy said: \"That first night out of the joint, after Marita died, I was more afraid of my little daughter than I ever was of being in prison\". Also consider that the name \"Marita\" is similar to the name Mary; the mother of Jesus.When the wise men left, an angel appeared to Joseph. Joseph will represent Brendan, Katie's \"boyfriend\". In the bible, Joseph was to take Mary and Jesus to runaway to Egypt. Back to the movie, Brendan was initially planning to runaway with Katie to Las Vegas. The angel ordered Joseph to wait in Egypt, as Herod would come to look for and \"kill\" baby Jesus. Take this more figuratively when applying it to the film. If Katie went missing, Jimmy would most definitely look for, and \"kill her\" if she was found with Brendan. Joseph left with Mary and Jesus in the middle of the night, so no one would see them. So did Katie and Brendan.In the end, Sean (Kevin Bacon) does a finger point and shoot at Jimmy. He does this, because King Herod dies shortly thereafter. Lastly, consider the title of the movie. \"Mystic River\". Dave (Tim Robbins)'s body was thrown in a river. In Revelations 16:12, the Bible states: \"The sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great river Euphrates, and its water was dried up, to prepare the way for the kings from the east\". Here, \"kings from the east\" represents law enforcement in Boston.All I can say is... W-O-W. I would've never realized this film's merit if I hadn't uncovered the plot. The movie was serious, somber, sadistic and surreal... but this is exactly what Eastwood was going for, considering his views on religion. I leave this review with an acclaimed description of King Herod the Great: \"prepared to commit any crime in order to gratify his unbounded ambition\".",

            "content": "This movie was all about Tim Robbins for me, he stole the show and really showed great chops as always. I felt through all his pain and sympathized with his character, who very convincingly copped a true Bostonian accent right with the mannerisms. Penn and Bacon were solid as was Fishburne, who was a very welcome addition to the cast. I won't even go into the rest of the film, because for the most part it was a solid life lesson....until the atrocious ending.Laura Linney's character's overconfidence in her husband's thug life gang king status is absolutely ridiculous. His only real \"power\" came because he hid in numbers, like any other punk ass thug low-life. His brothers were always around to help with jobs and clean up messes or do dirty work, not to mention gang up on solitary Dave at the end. REAL manly there, REAL kingly. The ending completely glorified this type of ignorant and perfectly childish behavior as a \"winning combination\". Penn's character essentially kills a guy and gets off clean because of \"who he knows\"?! I know there are multiple ways to read this, but this is the implication to me. I love Eastwood most of the time, but he completely drops the ball here.Dave's character is left as nothing even close to a martyr as he SHOULD have been. He's simply cast off a HUGE pissing \"OH WELL\" as if he had it coming one way or the other, simply because of him getting the rotten end in life. If these kids were truly friends, Bacon's character would have wanted true justice to be done, especially knowing about Dave's prior abduction. Celeste is made out to be a paranoid, lost woman while Linney's bitch of a character remains strong and proud, so entitled of the way things went down. She's proud her man is still standing after it all goes down, as if it's some sort of Dirty Housewives competition. She has no care for HOW it went down, HOW her husband killed a man brutally in cold blood, THE WRONG MAN, and just smiles savagely at a woman who's whole world just fell to pieces. How is this possibly poetic justice or good storytelling? Sure tragedies happen, but I don't care who you are, you're getting caught eventually. There's NO MYSTERY left here when Jimmy confesses he wishes Bacon's character could have been faster. This entitled son of a b**** answers to no consequences and in the ending scene, the pointing trigger finger of Bacon needs to be taken as a sign that he's got Jimmy's back and his secret is safe with him. I'm still trying to figure how Fishburne won't find this out somehow seeing as he's a good cop with NO affiliations. What really chaps me is that Fishburne even challenges Bacon's loyalty, to which Bacon says I'll have my cuffs on the guy faster than you if it is indeed him. Well, where were the cuffs when he found out the killer of Dave was in fact Jimmy! The whole parade scene undermines not only Dave's character, but the entire integrity of the story. It essentially preaches that \"Hey, if you know the right people, have a enough muscle in town to inflict fear on those who question you and play off the misfortunes of others, you can get away with murder and just about any other kind of violence you want to\". Dave should have died the symbolic martyr, the guy who should have been extremely cared for by his friends and family and not simply ignored after going through a traumatic experience. They should have all paid for their lack of sympathy and empathy towards his rape and abuse that he sustained. He was made a negligible causality of one over-entitled thug's ignorant and egotistical vengeance streak. Jimmy is a complete piece of trash and by the end of the movie, I have absolutely no sympathy for him as a father or a man who lost his daughter. In a lot of ways, HE was the one who deserved such an event and because of this he made sure someone else had to pay for his pain like a little b****. Like a little child, he couldn't handle the heat when it finally, AND RIGHTFULLY, made it's way to his doorstep. Absolute s*** ending, ruined the entire movie in my opinion.",

This issue permeates the entire history mixed with other ingredients such as urban violence, family relationships and the madness of man in \"Mystic River\" directed by Clint Eastowood.The script is a delightful very well tied surprise, based on the novel \"Mystic River\" by Dennis Lhane. Three boys playing in the street and decide to write their names on a stretch of sidewalk with fresh cement. They are approached by two men, apparently police. One of the boys is taken. The rape of the boy is so implicit that the scene did not need to be shown. The escape scenes from the boy in the woods are gradually inserted in the film.A quick camera movement makes the move to modified lives of three boys, now adults. The disappearance and the news of the death of Jimmy's daughter (Sean Pean) is the trigger for the engineered plot in which count the order in this review would be a real crime.The performances of Sean Pean (Winner of the Oscar for Best Actor), Tim Robbins (Oscar winner for Best Supporting Actor) and Kevin Bacon are a real \"competition\" (in the healthy sense of the word) interpretation. The way the characters were raised and the natural spontaneity of dialogue give the film the necessary hardness of reality.Tim Robbins is alienated and shaken by the violence of human wolves who like a \"fresh meat.\" Sean Pean is someone who might call former mobster, but that does not lose his honor. Kevin Bacon is a more restrained police, like most men, but no less problematic. The interweaving of three different characters shows the different sides of the human being and the different reactions to the everyday barriers.It is remarkable the high aesthetic standard of the direction of Eastwood. The filters used to give color, or rather the lack of color, with the predominance of blue and gray where actions always seem to happen at night, or at least close to it. The \"track\" sound and literally opens the paths of the film and is signed, surprisingly, by Eastwood himself.Not only the technical quality is seen but the whole foundation contained in metaphors and analogies constantly present. An interesting example is the ring detail containing a priest crucifix on the finger of one of pedophiles kidnappers early in the film, a critique of incredible pervasiveness of evil.No one should miss the chance to watch \"Mystic River.\" A film that overcomes a police simply outcome of its history. He proposes reflections every moment. While reading subtitles thoughts fly in parallel trying to find explanations to the facts. The values \u200b\u200band justice lose their usefulness in a society in which evil is always ready to pounce. Evil and good are more relative than they seem. To wake up relaxed is better to leave the past in the bottom of the river, because there he never will.",

            "content": "Yes, I know. Some people gonna scream when thy ll see my vote and my commentary. But it is really what I believe. I love all previous Eastwood's movies. Especially \"True Crime\" which was a real good work, almost a masterpiece. But with this, I started to become aware of something : As a director, Eastwood is talented, no doubt about it. But it seems that we cannot hope another surprises in his further movies. Yes, this movie is well directed. Yes, the actors are all making an outstanding performance. Yes, the scenario is clever. Yes, the image is beautiful. But we can too easily guess what would be the final word at the end. \"No, its not good to make our own justice\". Of course we understand the complexity of the characters, but from now on, I am under the impression that Eastwood can't make a movie without a slightly progressive morale even if its not a good one. And thats my point. Its too much, because there is no surprise. When I saw Million Dollar Baby I thought it gonna be different. Yet, this latter is more interesting and even more better, but as soon as Hilary Swank hurt is head, I was able to guess what was the real purpose of the film : Eastwood, can, once again, give us his view of a society issue. Very well. But if he does that every time, the movie lose its interest and both Mystic River and Million... are less powerful. I think it would be good, (but its just my opinion) if the morale was less obvious. It would give the audience more to think about.",

This was also the first time I actually noticed the directors hand (Eastwood) -- like filming from one side under shadow and opposite in sun light.  This is his best directed movie in my opinion.Most of the negative reviews mentioned the crazy ending.

I think that everything that happens after the last conversation between Jimmy and Sean is not meant to be taken literally.  During this conversation, Sean says something about their whole lives being a dream, ever since Dave got in the car.  So I think the ending of the film has taken this idea, and is presenting a kind of dream future in which things work out the way Sean and Jimmy would like them to.Consider what happens.  Immediately after this, Sean's wife calls again and they reconcile.  She turns up with a baby, and they hang out on the street like a happy family watching a parade going by.  (Is this very likely? She has magically returned from Manhattan the same day, and they decide the most important thing to do is to watch a parade?  Would Sean really not be dragging Jimmy down to the station for an interrogation?)What Jimmy wants is absolution for what he has done, and this is given to him by his wife: she not only justifies the murder, but absolves him of feeling guilt for Celeste.  (\"What kind of wife would say that about her husband?\" she says.)",

            "content": "I came away from this movie with a real appreciation for the impeccable acting, the somber mood and pacing, and the layers of guilt and regret that were slowly exposed in the film. Even though I thought, \"Wow...that was a really good movie\", something kept bothering me over the next few days as I thought about the film. I finally put my finger on it when I considered some issues concerning coincidences and motives.Other reviewers have noted the coincidental nature of the events that took place on the night of the murder: Dave Boyle just happens to be in the bar where Katie Markum shows up; after he leaves the bar, he just happens to beat a man, injuring his hand and is covered with blood; Brendan's brother just happens to come across Jimmy's daughter in the street as she's driving her car; he happens to be carrying the same gun that night his father used to rob a liquor store several years earlier; he just happens to fire the gun at her and...well, you get my point. All this happens all ON THE SAME NIGHT.A more central problem I had with the plot was this: why was Dave Boyle even suspected in this murder? In the eyes of the police and his wife, what could possibly be his motive for killing a relative of his wife? Yes, he had an injured hand and later blood was food in his car, but why didn't anyone bother to probe a possible motive? Everyone assumed that just because he saw her at a bar that somehow made him culpable in her murder. It would have made more sense (plot-wise) if, earlier in the film, there had been some sort of connection established between Dave Boyle and Katie Markum. Otherwise, everything that pointed to Dave as a murderer was all circumstantial evidence (which, as it turns out, it was just that).Of course, the storyline is really driven by this point: the past events can influence the future in ways we cannot even imagine and guilt and a desire for justice can lead to strange and unexpected paths. It's just too bad that this important theme was not supported with a tighter and more cohesive plot.",

            "content": "The film opens with three kids, Jimmy, Sean and Dave playing on a street in their neighbourhood, when they start behaving mischievously. Caught in the act, they get a dressing down from one of two men in a car passing by. The man, who appears to be a cop advises them to tell their parents what they have done. Dave, who doesn't live on that street, thinking he will be taken home to his mother, gets in the car, reluctantly ... It will be four days before he manages to escape his tormenters...Years later, the now adult three have more or less lost contact with each other. Dave is married and has a young son but has never been the same since his abduction. Jimmy has a past as a burglar and has done some time in prison. He is now settled as the manager of a groceries store but his 'cousins' are never far to give a hand when necessary; old habits die hard... He has a nineteen year-old daughter, Katie. Her boyfriend, Brendan, is the son of an enemy of Jimmy, a certain Ray Harris, now disappeared...\nOne night, Dave comes back home covered in blood, his hand seriously injured, and tells his wife he may have killed someone who tried to mug him. The following day, Katie is found dead, shot, and molested. Sean, now a police investigator, and his colleague Whitey are put on the case. Soon, Dave and Brendan are among the prime suspects...Whether or not we consider Clint Eastwood the director as talented as the actor, in 'Mystic River' he has crafted a fine dramatic work who's measured pace contributes to our comprehension of this complex subject. Some may call it 'slow', but would this film function (as well) any other way?, for 'Mystic River' does require the complete attention of its viewers. The investigation is a pleasure to follow because very clear - up to 'Law & Order' standards, to say the least. At the same time we are shown the characters involved, how they cope with the murder and for some, how they may be related to it...'Mystic River' may not be appreciated by everybody (because of its measured pace, perhaps, or whatever else...). But, this film, I would say, possesses qualities certainly too rarely found nowadays, probably the qualities that made the great tragedies. It brings into sharp focus the tragic instant before which we may keep hold of our life and after which we are no longer master of events. The question is asked: What would have become of the three, if Jimmy, or Sean, had been in the car instead of Dave ?\nI gave it 8/10.As a bonus, there is a guest appearance from an old friend of Eastwood, none other than Eli Wallach (uncredited).The final word, a quote from Clint Eastwood: \"I've always had the ability to tell the audience 'watch this film if you like, and if you don't, take a hike!\".",

It is one of the best films I have seen this year, with an excellent script and direction, and high quality performances by the cast.  My one quibble with the film is the lack of development Jimmy's wife, played by Laura Linney. In general, character development is a strength of this film, with Jimmy, Sean, Dave and Celeste fully fleshed out.  Since I did not read the book, I am not sure if the character of Jimmy's wife is better defined in the book, but I needed one more scene before her final scene with Jimmy to help me to understand her better.  I needed a scene which showed that she felt like she was losing her family to Jimmy's obsession with finding his daughter's killer, and expressing those feelings directly to Jimmy.  No foundation was laid for her subsequent acceptance, and even encouragement, of his decision to \"do whatever is necessary\". Had I been editing the film, I would have beefed up Linney's character and dumped the story line with Sean's wife, which did not necessarily provide much insight into Sean's character.  I was perfectly happy to believe that he was a dutiful if not somewhat distracted cop, and did not need the scenes with his wife to support that.  I can only assume these scenes were added to provide at least some semblance of a happy ending in what was otherwise a decidedly tragic film.  9/10",

            "content": "Mystic River comes with baggage. It's Oscar success, the casting of actors very much at the top of their game and a director who's contribution to popular culture through cinema has been long and varied.\nSuch a list always fills me with a nervous anticipation, a sense that 'it may not be all it's made out to be'. In this sense I'm happy to say that Mystic River does not disappoint.  The Oscars are well deserved (very much so), the cast superb and Eastwood directing stylishly, if a little fussily at times. The plot is a simple one, a modern rough at the edges 'who dunnit', centering around three old neighbourhood friends with some shared baggage of their own.Where Mystic River scores points is not in the complexity of its narrative as a good yarn (though that is not to be underestimated), but in the issues that run through the film.  This is precisely that kind of cinematic experience that everyone draws their own set of issues from. In the boiling pot are issues of justice, retribution, prejudice, working class anger, personal history and so much more.  In particular it should be noted that Robbins character raises all sorts of issues about what we think the better of two evils are, that in not doing one evil deed but perpetrating another (slightly less evil one) makes him a man deserving our sympathy- and it really does, such is the strength of his performance and Helgelend's beautfuly succint script. Above all else it's a powerful film, leading to more questions than it can ultimately answer.Critics who point to its poor acting I cannot respond to you. Even allowing for taste and parochial accent spotting, all the cast perform well, with Penn and particularly Robbins as stand outs.  If you seriously quesiton the quality on display here it's hard to know quote what you would consider a 'great' perfromance to be.Indeed what ultimately stands out from Mystics River - fine script aside - are the performances. Worth the admission price alone for anyone with a serious interest in cinema or who just wants to enjoy an interesting few hours of thought provoking film. There are flaws, yes. The whole thing is just slighlty too long for example and the ending whilst refeshingly un-hollywoodised is disappointing.In sum, great acting, nice script and a definate must see.8/10",

            "content": "If I had just come across this movie on TV, I probably would have liked it. But with all the Oscar buzz and four-star reviews I expected something better. The story is about three guys in Boston: Dave, Sean, and Jimmy. They were best friends until about the age of 12, when Dave (who grows up to be Tim Robbins) was kidnapped by pedophiles masking as cops. This, I thought, was the best part of the movie. Sadly it's the first few minutes.Cut to 25 years later, when Jimmy's (Sean Penn) daughter is murdered. Dave, who despite having a wife (Marcia Gay Harden) and son is still in a regressed state from his horrific childhood experience, begins to attract his wife's suspicion. He shows up after the murder with blood on his clothes, claiming to have fought off a mugger. Sean (Kevin Bacon) has become a cop and of course is assigned to the case. The main suspect, besides Robbins, is the murdered girl's boyfriend (Tom Guiry). But Sean's partner \"Whitey\" (Laurence Fishburne) starts to look suspiciously at Dave instead.There's all sorts of other stuff too; mob connections and old grudges and, believe it or not, a couple of mute characters. Too long to explain here. As for the acting: Penn is very good at parts and terribly over the top in others. Watch him react to his daughter's death and see if he doesn't remind you of his retarded character in \"I Am Sam.\" Robbins mostly does well, but overacts at times. He gives a good sense of Dave's arrested development, except where the script requires him to be suddenly cunning or insightful. Bacon and Fishburne both do good subtle work with trite \"cop buddy movie\" dialogue. Harden is moving at times but too one-note. Guiry does well, especially towards the end.The biggest waste is Laura Linney, as Jimmy's second wife, the murdered girl's stepmother. She is barely in the film until the end, when she makes a big Lady Macbeth-like speech. I hope the screenwriter, Brian Helgeland, didn't see that as a subtle allusion. Eastwood does a good job with setting and pacing, but could have directed his actors better.There were several moments here that clearly weren't intended to be funny, but provoked a fair amount of laughter in the theatre. Be forewarned: if someone's making a moral decision in this film, you can bet there's a cross nearby. It's that kind of picture.Conclusion: It might be worth seeing, but wait for video. 6/10",

The story however, lacked the soul or spirit of the characters it attempted to portray.The ending did nothing more than further my belief that genuine attempts at looking at real life fall short when the director is trying to preach - although I'm still scratching my head and wondering what it is that Mr. Eastwood is trying to sell.

This movie is excellently paced and everything in the movie (setting, characters, music, cinematography) goes along to the support the dark and dreary mood and it is becuase of this that the movie is so successful into drawing you in.  The plot tugs you along feeding you just enough information to keep you intrigued in finding out what is going on.  Moreover, 'Mystic River' is quite powerful in the actions and consequences that are presented in the movie.  While some of it may seem not very realistic, it is all about the importance of one decision.  The ending is also quite disturbing, but I think it is becuase of this ending that the movie is so greaat.Beyond the film itself, the acting is superb.  This is the best acting job that I have ever seen from Sean Penn.  Tim Robbins also puts forth a notewaorthy performance and I woulnd't be surprised if both of them recieve an Oscar nod; and of course not to mention Clint.If you want to see a happy movie - this isn't it.  HOwever, if you want to see a movie with superb acting, great old-fashioned suspense, with scenes that make you think then this is it.  I give it a 9 out of 10.",

So many things about it made it undeserving of its accolades, and I can't understand why more people don't feel this way.This movie was supposed to be a smart, feisty whodunnit. About twenty minutes into the movie, the body of Katie is found. As soon as the cops disclose the details of how she was murdered, it's ridiculously obvious who killed her. That completely killed the movie for me.Secondly, there are no likable characters. Tim Robbins, Marcia Gay Harden, maybe... But not really.Thirdly, Sean Penn is just being Sean Penn. Not much acting involved. Academy Award? I think not. Political statement? Absolutely.Next, Sean Penn's wife has almost no development until she comes out of nowhere with this wacko speech at the end of the movie. Where did that come from? It made no sense.Yet another thing... Kevin Bacon's storyline had no relevance to the movie whatsoever. Why did she leave? Why did she come back? Why did she leave when she was pregnant? And all of a sudden she comes back for no reason... and they go watch a parade??? Would you go watch a parade on the first day you've seen your missing wife in 6 months? YAWN!Lastly, the reason the two boys killed Katie was boring and anticlimactic. Actually the whole movie is anticlimactic.Watch this movie if someone puts a gun to your head and makes you. Otherwise, go rent the real Best Picture of the Year. Rotk.",

Also, the acting was good.. particularly the dramatic Sean Penn crying scene, and Tim Robbins' silent sympathetic acting. But I just feel that critics are in love with Clint Eastwood and therefore give him too much credit.  What was the point of the film??  I for one haven't read the book so maybe I should do that before asking this, but what was the underlying message of the movie---that good guys always lose and that in lower middle class neighborhoods in Boston the ex-cons rule the town while secretly offing the people that get in their way?  Sure, it may show the corruptness and multi-layeredness (if that's a word) of the world, but I don't think that it had a really understandable POINT.  Those people had no value system--no morals!  Maybe I'm just missing the message but I just don't think this film deserves an oscar or golden globe nod at all.  Get over Clint Eastwood, he's not that fabulous a director.. sure Bridges of Madison County was all right.. but he made Space Cowboys, for crying out loud.",

This movie will have you at the edge of your seat from beginning till end. A combination of a great story along with highly talented actors, as well as being directed by one of the great people in the film industry ever, makes this movie unique. The characters are conflicting with each other in a way that makes you feel the need for taking breaks while watching the film. Tim Robbins delivers his second best performance in his career only topped by his performance as Andy Dufresne in \"The Shawshank Redemption.\" Sean Penn is amazing as usual.Whenever you think this film has reached its climax, it takes you one step further. Sometimes it is directly uncomfortable. You find yourself clutching the arms of your chair and shaking your head while muttering something under your breath regarding what the characters are doing. When the movie reached its true climax, it felt like my heart was about to explode.If I was to summarize the entire film in one word, I would say: \"Tense.\" Watch it.

            "content": "This is the story of three boys marked by an awful incident in the sixties. When we meet them grown up 25 years later the developing tragedy is connected to what has happened to one of them and is reflected upon the two others. And it\u00b4s sad, sad, sad,...one of the saddest  movies I\u00b4ve ever seen.I like Clint Eastwood, as an actor (in the the Italian movies) and as a director (Bird, Unforgiven, Bridges of Madison County and the film of John Huston filming The African Queen). And, since John Huston is my favorite director, I wonder how he would have directed this story - I believe he would have liked this Eastwood version. One of the boys mentioned above, Sean, now a police man, becomes \"The Good\", investigating the murder of the daughter of his former childhood friend Jimmy (\"The Bad\", with a criminal past), all leading up to Dave (the third of the childhood friends, prime suspect-\"the Ugly\", not physically but mentally due to what happened to him.) What strikes me most in this picture is the description of this part of an American city, in this case Boston - very unusual in an American film (not critically) - (I haven\u00b4t read the novel which the film is based upon.) What I found most striking in this picture is the acting: Tim Robbins made me cry - he made the most of his complex character. He will stay in my mind for a long time. As for Sean Penn he made the best in the first part of the film, then I think he (or the director) lost control of his character. Kevin Bacon has never been better but he has the least complex character to play. The weak points in this movie are the teenagers fight in the end of the film and Laura Linney(Jimmy\u00b4s wife) making Jimmy acceptable (for example the Oscar jury ) and Sean\u00b4s and Jimmy\u00b4s last talk - could have been better played, better directed. But the last memory of this film staying in mind is when Celeste,Dave\u00b4s wife is calling for Michael, their son, in the parade. What will happen to him...I hope he will go unmarked out of this and leave this Mystic River area....",

My definition of a really good movie or book is that within only a few minutes of watching/reading, you are so drawn in that you forget you are doing either.  That immersion happens about 10% of the time, and it really doesn't matter if the remaining 90% is marginally bad or truly awful. The only thing that's key is that the movies in that 90% range just aren't good.\nI won't even begin to analyze what is missing in this movie, because that's not the issue.  What is important is that none of the characters seemed real or mattered to me; I didn't care what happened next; and I was so singularly uninvolved that at several points I just kept wondering when it was going to be over.So, who was in it, whether or not they acted well (most of them didn't, or they would have been able to achieve at least temporary audience absorption), who directed it, and how many awards it's slated to win due to its instant notoriety and 'profound social commentary' are all irrelevant.

The acting's nicely done, and, as mentioned above, the visuals are great.  It's worth the $8, and worth $5 to rent it in 2004 when it comes out on video as well.  I don't go to the movies more than ten times a year, so you can imagine that a film has to be pretty damn good if I'm going to pay all the money to go to a theater.In a nutshell:  \"Mystic River\" is a dark, disturbing, entertaining, thought-provoking film that you should definitely check out.",

Of course, the sins don't stay buried. . .In a story where everyone has a secret and very few things are as they seem. A mature and craggy Sean Penn (who seems to morph into Robert Deniro in this film) plays a South Boston working-class ex-con whose 19-year-old daughter is brutally murdered. In the scenes following the discovery of her body, Penn displays depths of agony and anger so real that he's sometimes difficult to watch -- but impossible to ignore. As Dave Boyle, the childhood friend whose life was destroyed by a horrific abduction and episode of sexual abuse (by a priest and another pedophile posing as a cop)Tim Robbins is heart-breaking. Shambling, gentle, vacant, and yet harboring violent tendencies that call his innocence into question, he turns in a complex and nuanced performance. Kevin Bacon, playing the third childhood friend and the only one to escape from the neighborhood -- he goes to college and becomes a detective -- is steely, appealing, and complex. There are scenes in this movie where the tension and sheer male aggression is so thick you could slice it with Penn's knife -- and he does. There are multiple threads going on in this story, and some of the loose ends aren't tied up until the very end, which is satisfying in a storytelling sense. Laura Linney takes a good turn as a crime-fanmily matriarch in the making, though Marcia Gay Harden, as Dave's wife, was a little whiny for my taste. All in all, a very fine film that raises questions about fear, sin, redemption, and the inescapable power of our pasts.",

The \"who-done-it\" type of plot is merely a \"delivery vehicle\" in this case, just a way of slapping a number of character types together in a situation which might (and does!) reveal something about them.

It's a movie about how love can make one to accept the unacceptable, how old friendships can make people turn a blind eye on some things(*), and how unbelievably cruel children can be at times. It's also a movie about how pressure can crack those weak at heart and make them betray their family.In a word, this is not your average \"The Usual Suspects\" thriller.

Tim Robbins(David Boyle)was so good playing the victim of child molestation that it made me wonder if he had been a victim in real life.  His characterization was so moving, that you felt all the emotions he was portraying and more.  I sobbed with him, I cried with him, etc.  I did not know he was this talented an actor.  Sean Penn as the kid from the streets was also awesome but Laura Linney (his wife) was a right bitch and Linney's performance was lukewarm at best. Whitey (Laurence Fishburne) was okay with his bad cop attitude and Kevin Bacon was okay too but there was nothing spectacular about their performances.  LF's accent as a Black Bostonian was damn good, I've never encountered a Black Bostonian in my life.  There were three great actors in the movie, the last member of the triumvrate is Marcia Gay Harden, as the stuttering housewife.  When she started thinking Dave was guilty of the murder, you could see her fear and pain.SpoilerDave did not commit the murder of the daughter of his childhood friend.Alternative Ending (this better be on the dvd I will purchase)In actuality, it was three people who entered the car with that scary dude that molested poor Dave, so it should have been three people who died when Sean killed Dave.  One could say that Dave's death occurred when the child molesters touched him, but since he had to die physically in the film, his childhood friends should have died too.  Marcia Gay Harden's Celeste should have shot Sean at the parade and the lieutenant friend of Dave's should not have reunited with his wife, but had to deal with the death of his two friends and gone insane and committed suicide.I loved this film, it resonated with me for reasons I do not feel like divulging, but I am sure you can guess at.  It showed me that there is hope and that pain is a part of life, a fact one must deal with no matter how bad, if they don't consider suicide an option.",

Yesterday evening I went to the cinema with a friend to watch this movie and I was full of expectation. You know, a good rate in imdb is always a good hint to decide which movie to see. But this time I was disappointed. After the first 20 minutes it was clear that Dave (Tim Robbins) was not the murderer and I took 5 more minutes to realize that the mute brother of the boyfriend was the guilty. Ok, the movie is nice with great interpretation of the actors. Especially, Tim Robbins is great and should deserve an oscar for his act. Also Sean Penn is really fine, but I liked more Johnny Depp in Pirates of the Carrabean, if I have to decide. Overall Mystic River is a movie to see, well described, with great actors. If you're used to see police movie , you can figure out easily the plot and how it is going to end. This lowers my rate. My final vote is 7/10 but it's not a mustsee.",

What causes one person (Dave) to be chosen by predators as a \"victim\" as a child, and his friends who were with him to walk away? Was Dave's self preservation instinct(read: self love) less finely tuned than his friends?  Is that not visible to predators, just as the limping gazelle is sought out by the lion in the wild? After surviving the abduction and growing to manhood, he again became the \"victim\" when Sean Penn's character demanded a life in return for the murder of his daughter. Dave's young son was already on his way to becoming a victim, his wife also became one. Many of the minor characters in the film were obviously developed to show tendencies of either \"victim\" or \"tough survivor\". Is it necessary to have or to hone the type of \"strength\" portrayed by Jimmy...in order to prevent one's self from becoming a victim?  Are there only survivors or victims in life...must we choose one? Is it \"eat or be eaten\"?",

Not even one flicker of light exists..Not one smile..all exaggerated overdramatizing 'Oscar performances'. There is no such thing as coincidence..Nowhere on the planet could there be that many wretched miserable people, with wretched, hopeless lives in one place, in one movie. Don't see this movie if you are in a depressed state of mind.  There are no clowns in this parade, only puppets \"ACTING\" like there is a reason for Armageddon Now. At least it gave actors unlimited angst possibilities. But it also opens an unwary public to an incredibly DARK and hopeless America, with no hope of redemption..In the final view, who benefits from an American Tragedy like this, coming on the heels of 9/11? Oh well the audiences can always 'drown' themselves in Mystic River. Coincidentally, WHY a Christmas release??? In time for 2003 Awards, or a way to blow Christmas away?",

Sean Penn did a good job portraying his role, but the role itself wasn't necessarily compelling or believable. Sure a man in his situation would be devastated, but it still seems a bit over the top. Laurence Fishburne did a great job in this, as did Tim Robbins. Tim's character I didn't find very believable, however, and I can't understand why he and Sean Penn both picked up Oscars for this. A lot of what this movie does right, however, is keep it interesting enough to see the end. Unfortunately, that end is somewhat confusing, and left me feeling unfulfilled. Worth catching on cable or renting for cheap, but I just don't think it lives up to the hype.",

            "content": "The movie begins with a very innocent scene of three boys playing on the street, (Sean Penn as Jimmy Markum; Kevin Bacon as Sean Devine; Tim Robbins as Dave Boyle). One of the boys is kidnapped, and molested by old men. The entire movie develops around the drama of one of the boys' years later after becoming adults; loose a daughter in an accidental tragedy. The daughter of Jimmy Markum is killed in a very brutal way. This tragedy brings the three childhood friends together. But; Dave is not being mentally stable since he was abused as a child. The theme in this movie is about how bad actions can lead to a chain of bad consequences. This movie was filmed in Boston. The motif of the Mystic River, is to show the dark side of human beings, and what people is capable of in the name of making revenge, or make the one that is consider the bad person pay the high price for everything that happened. Jimmy Markum is a guy that doesn't let anyone to mess around with him, or his family. It also shows how careful human being must be before judging other people, or collecting enough evidence to support their decisions. It emphasizes how a dark past during a childhood can ruin, ones entire life. It shows the innocence of youth. Celeste Boyle, Dave's wife betrayed her husband base on inconclusive motifs that lead to a very dark finale. Mrs. Boyle did not make enough efforts to find out indeed the mental situation of her husband. This movie is a very intense dark drama, and suspense. Along with this situation, there is other drama that linked to the dark past of Jimmy Markum as suspicious to the assassination of his very young daughter Katie. Mr. Markum past could lead to this happen. In this highly dark emotional movie Sean Penn had a good acting by showing his feeling after discovering the action by taking justice with his own hands, was completely wrong, and losing one of his best friends. One can just imagine the pain of a father to see his own daughter killed in such as brutal way. Sometimes, in this movie it even seems to be right, to kill the one that cause the death of our love ones. But, we can not forget if we kill every one that cause us pain, nobody in this universe will be alive. To love, and forgive is first.",

Led by Sean Penn as a grief-stricken Boston tough who sets out to avenge a death at any cost, the film achieves a level of Shakespearean tragedy (elements of \"Macbeth\" and \"Titus Andronicus\" immediately come to mind) without ever embracing the lyricism of the bard's work.  As compelling as the characters are, there are none who are sympathetic and the film is relentlessly grim as it marches towards its unsatisfying conclusion (nearly 3 long hours after the relentlessly grim beginning).  As Penn's childhood buddies, Tim Robbins gives an outstanding performance as a man scarred by a childhood trauma, and Kevin Bacon is low-key but equally effective as the friend who grew up to become an investigating detective.  The talented Laura Linney, who is not always used to good advantage in films, is downright scary here as Penn's single-minded and ruthless wife, but Marcia Gay Harden really shines as Robbin's suspicious and inceasingly frantic spouse.  This is one of a couple of critically acclaimed films this year that I feel have been highly overrated, yet I feel that the cast does deserve whatever awards they may win.",

Katie loves daddy and daddy loves Katie -- but she is going to run off with a kid that daddy abhors. And, why was she going to run off???  Well, of course, [according to the testimony of two half idiotic teen aged kids] \"She wanted to get out of this crummy town and to start a new life.\"  Yeah, sure... a new life with another teen ager in Las Vegas. Katie gets killed at 1:00 AM in the morning -- but, it turns out, she was killed as a result of a couple of kids (one being a deaf mute) who happened to be up at 1:00 AM playing a kid's game with a real gun -- which just happens to be the gun that was used in a robbery 18 years ago, and which -- owing to stupendous police work -- can be identified because the police still had an 18 year old record of the markings of that gun.

The worst offense was that blood type analysis and DNA analysis go hand in hand these days, and they turn up the victim's gender along with their blood type, but that didn't happen here, apparently.2. The river as a routine \"washing\" solution also strikes me as ludicrously unlikely.3. That a liquor store owner can somehow become viewed as a powerful \"king\" of the neighborhood also strikes me as dubious.Maybe the book covered these somehow, but a film with gaps like these got me scratching my head too often, and not able to view the characters as genuine. Their idiosyncracies also got to me after a while (e.g., two characters who mostly don't speak, a \"borderline\" guy who goes quickly from too lucid to too fuzzy, and a mob boss-type character who looks and acts clean (but penitent), yet has crooks hanging around with him routinely.Overall, it's a decent movie for character studies, and a nice place to see some favorite actors, but I say it's a bit of fluff that managed to warp a lot of people into making it to be something it just isn't.",

            "content": "Poor Dave Boyle, he about to be abducted in the presence of his two buddies, Jimmy & Sean. His abduction is the beginning of a truly horrific crime. Over the next two hours and fourteen minutes we get to see this crime deepen and expand, filling a much acclaimed movie with it's vile shadows. The crime of which we speak? Perhaps one of the most ridiculous, coincidence driven contrivances ever set to celluloid.It's about to be a very bad night for Jimmy and Dave. After thirty years of torment over his childhood molestation, Dave Boyle finally snaps and beats to death some random pedophile. Oh, poor Dave's luck is terrible. At the very same time, his buddy Jimmy's daughter Katie is being murdered by her boyfriend Brendan's younger brother, Silent Ray. All this on the night before Katie is supposed to run off to Las Vegas with Brendan, missing her sister's conformation. Stepping in to investigate Katie's murder is Dave and Jimmy's other friend from that moment thirty years ago, Sean Devine. Oh, and just to add to the insanity (like there wasn't enough), fifteen years ago, Jimmy secretly murdered Brendan & Silent Ray's father. Is this the plot for a widely acclaimed movie or a soap opera?If all this wasn't enough, the unclear reason for Katie's murder surfaces even more tortured logic. The reason for the murder are never clearly explained, leaving several possible explanations, each more ridiculous than the previous.\u0095 This was the idea my girlfriend and I came up with 20 minutes into the movie, after we had figured out the entire plot to come. Silent Ray kills Katie to keep his brother Brendan from leaving. There is little to support this idea in the movie apart from Brendan's reaction when he discovers the truth, and even that is ambiguous. This is the most plausible motive, and yet is still patently unbelievable. \u0095 This was an idea proposed by a friend of mine, Silent Ray kills Katie in revenge for the murder of his father. There is nothing suggesting that Ray even knows that Jimmy killed his father. As a motive it sucks. As an explanation for the murder, it sucks even more. \u0095 Then there is the movie's somewhat confusing explanation given by Sean to Jimmy. That Silent Ray and his buddy were just screwing around and happened to unwittingly select Katie as the target of their inexplicable criminal endeavor. Then they accidentally shoot her after realizing who she is, perpetuating her beating and murder to cover their crime. If this is the movie's explanation, than writers have created an even more insanely ridiculous coincidence than the one supporting the main plot.The fact that the murder's motive was barely explained in the movie just adds to the movie's lack of believability. And there are even more unanswered questions and unlikely plot devices:\u0095 Where was Katie driving in the middle of the night (since it seems unlikely she was going home before running off to Las Vegas)? \u0095 Do pedophiles ever work in pairs and molest their victims together? I couldn't find a single, credible case like that portrayed in the movie. \u0095 Would a cop with connections to both the victim and suspect really still be working the case? \u0095 Would and cop really let a couple of neighborhood thugs meddle in their investigation? \u0095 Is it really believable that Dave Boyle would stay in the neighborhood? \u0095 Why does Dave's wife Celeste go to Jimmy with her suspicions rather than the police? Does she really want her husband to be murdered? \u0095 When Dave is insisting to Jimmy that he murdered a pedophile, not Katie, why doesn't he take Jimmy and the Savage brothers to where he dumped the body? This is immediately the most obvious choice for someone trying to save his life and prove his innocence.This last point leads to the last coincidence, that the police find the body of the pedophile just a few hours too late to save Dave's life.When you add this series of ridiculous coincidences and Hollywood contrivances to some horrible overacting and Laura Linney's laughably overblown transformation at the end of the movie you get the stuff of mediocrity, not greatness. Why then is this movie regarded by many as being Oscar quality? It seems that good cinematography, attention to visual detail and a slowed pace can turn schlock into art for many (see Troy). Add to this actors who can act emotion (even widely inappropriate emotion), and you have film-making at it's finest. Story and plotting count for little any more. Obviously the standards of those who watch movies have grossly deteriorated.And a final word about Sgt. Whitey Powers. He's smart enough to tell from the set of a man's shoulders if he's a former convict, but still too dumb to realize that the victim of child molestation is no more likely to grow up and murder adult women than any other person.",

It is a mostly humorless and occasionally difficult realist drama, that will undoubtedly affect most viewers emotionally in a variety of ways--you may cry, you may become angry with at least one character and the lack of just deserts, and you may find it a bit depressing, although producer/director/composer Clint Eastwood and scripter Brian Helgeland do through in a relatively minor glimmer of hope/happiness at the very end.\n\nNot that I tend to agree with awards organizations, but it should be no surprise that Mystic River has fine acting. A bulk of its many awards and nominations, including two Oscar victories, were for on screen performances. What is less recognized is the positive effect that the locations, cinematography, lighting and score have on the atmosphere of the film. Kokayi Ampah found the perfect, generic, metropolitan lower middle class neighborhoods, buildings and bars. It could be any slightly depressing, but maybe about to gentrify, suburb of Boston, New York City, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Chicago, Detroit, or any number of at least Northeastern and Midwestern U.S. cities. Tom Stern's cinematography is continually, subtly inventive. Just check out the shot of Sean Penn where shadows from a railing form symbolic jail bars on the wall behind him. The lighting tends to the late 1990s/early 2000s look that is more monochromatic and leaning-towards blue. There are a lot of well-placed shadows, often creating a chiaroscuro look. Eastwood's score is understated but very effective. And how can you not like a film where three sexy girls dance on top of a bar to jazz fusion?\n\nThe story is absorbing. There is an unexpected (to me, at least--I try to watch films the first time knowing as little about them as possible) mystery angle that is effectively sustained until almost the end. I haven't read Dennis Lehane's novel yet, but I just ordered it after seeing the film--the film piqued my interest enough to want to explore more. But the most interesting part of the story to me, at least, was the extremely gray depiction of Penn's character, Jimmy Markum. Markum is revealed to be largely criminal, and not quite likable in his attitude towards his daughter (he doesn't respect her individuality, even though she's actually an adult). Yet at the same time, he is compared by at least one character to a \"king\", and in many ways, he is treated as one in the neighborhood. This may or may not be meant more metaphorically by the character saying it, but it is possible to read much of the film as being about a traditional king trying to live in modern day metropolitan suburbia. In some historical and cultural contexts, surely Markum's behavior in the film would have a more noble sheen, including his \"mistake\". This is perhaps why poetic justice never arrives, and instead, the character is seen as contented, with his queen and court by his side, being regaled with a parade instead. In modern contexts, many kings' behavior would not be so noble, and instead we'd notice more the injustices done to the peasantry and sympathize with them. Markum's character cannot be depicted more literally as royalty, as if he were far removed from the socio-economic status of the film's peasantry (although we find out eventually that he has more money to spare than most folks in his neighborhood), because it would be instead read as a moral tale of economic disparity as is exists solely in modern times. Putting everyone on a level playing field, more or less, is the only way to create a parable of how kings would be perceived, solely in terms of their decisions and actions, in our era.\n\nOf course, there is more to the film than that, and it's not the only interpretation possible (in fact, it probably seems very left field to many readers), but it's worth pointing out not only as something literally interesting to contemplate, but to show the kind of storytelling depth that is contained in Mystic River--a film you should not miss.",

The cinematography is surprisingly crisp for a 2003 film, it's a style that would come to be adopted by a subsequent generation of 'gritty' thrillers and dramas alike. Narratively, it's a capable but probably not world-changing mystery; there are appropriately subverted expectations, good procedural investigation elements, and the involvement of the audience in the course of the plot without being omnipotent observers. I'm not necessarily the most convinced by the film's ending (or more specifically, the responses of the main characters to certain revelations about their own actions, without going into too many spoilers), but it's still pretty enjoyable (and most importantly, believable despite being grim). Though taking a peak at the cast list might initially make you think that the film was attempting to trade on name recongition rather than competent filmmaking, it's hard to complain about any of the performances; even the relatively little-known Guiry (who hasn't really escaped child actor status) does justice to an unexpectedly complex character. \n\nWhy is Fishburne's character unironically named Whitey Powers?

Brian Helgeland's screenplay is also sensational, and expertly uses clever non-linear storytelling to keep viewers absorbed in the murder mystery. It is hard to not praise the powerful performances from the cast. Sean Penn delivers one of the best performances of his career as Jimmy Markum. With riveting expressions, he conveys the guilt, desperation and righteous anger of a tormented father that is determined to avenge his daughter's death. Tim Robbins is equally excellent in the role of a sexually abused victim that becomes an easy scapegoat for the murder. Robbins brings out the trauma of sexual abuse through emotional monologues. Finally, it is hard to not mention Kevin Bacon. As an obsessive detective, he brings his natural charisma to one of his finest roles. Although \"Mystic River\" is undeniably an unforgettable crime drama, ultimately it is not a flawless film. If there's a minor drawback to the movie, it suffers from a disappointing ending. It's an ambiguous finale that leaves viewers frustrated with its lack of resolution. Nevertheless, fans of crime dramas will definitely enjoy \"Mystic River\" and so will movie-goers seeking taut entertainment. At a time when Clint Eastwood seems to have lost his spark as a filmmaker, it's a rousing reminder of his long forgotten talent for telling stories about traumatized men whose lives are shattered by tragedy.",

            "content": "Clint Eastwood's 2003 who did it-thriller won Best Actor in a Leading Role and Best Supporting Actor at the Oscars and was nominated for all the other categories in addition to Best Picture. As you can already see from the wins for the actors, the great strength of this film lies in its performances. But with Eastwood's great direction and its electrifying suspense, the film brings many other great elements to the table. Mystic River tells the story of three childhood friends who drifted apart after an incident. Decades later, none of the three have left their hometown and a tragic event occurs. This brings the friends and their loved ones back together in very different roles.\n\nSean Penn won his first major Oscar for his embodiment of a family man with a criminal past who is out for revenge after a violent stroke of fate. In the course of this, the demons of the initially quite normal small-town resident crystallise, giving his character entirely new facets. This transformation is perfectly realised by Penn. What can be classified as passive-aggressive for the most part develops into escalation, especially towards the end. Tim Robbins, who won for Best Supporting Actor, is every bit as good as Penn with his performance, albeit in a very different way. His character, scarred by a terrible incident in his childhood, is clearly calmer, more subtle and, above all, more sensitive. Robbins brilliantly calls on all these traits, which also makes every interaction between him and Penn's character very interesting and explosive. In addition to the film's two stand outs, Kevin Bacon, Marcia Gay Harden and Laura Linney deliver strong performances. \n\nAlthough Mystic River seems like a standard murder-mystery at first impression, Eastwood manages to stage the actually banal plot fantastically with his flair for the appropriate cast, beautiful shots and an inimitable build-up of tension. You can hardly look away until the end, the resolution is unpredictable and the behaviour and communication of the characters captivate you. The only shortcoming is the ending. It seems abrupt and unsatisfactory after all the explosiveness. This film is not one for a happy ending, but Mystic River definitely deserved a more fitting finale.",

That's not to say it isn't an enjoyable film \u2014 it features fantastic acting all around, but most notably from Sean Penn as Jimmy Markum. The beginning is frightening \u2014 with sex abuse from, what I believe to be, the clergy \u2014 but that really just seems to lay a superficial foundation for Dave Boyle (Tim Robbins) to be reserved, skittish, and then become a suspect in Katie Markum's (Emmy Rossum) murder. I take issue with Dave's character from a logical perspective and believe if his storyline was cleaned up, the film would've benefited as a whole. He lies about a potential murder and/or violent encounter, dials that back, admits to a different murder (of a pedophile), retracts that and admits to Katie's murder, which didn't make sense to me at all. Even if Jimmy Markum is telling you he's \"not going to kill you\" as long as you admit to killing his daughter, every viewer knows he's going to kill you once you admit to killing his daughter \u2014 his childhood friend should've known that. Robbins also won an Oscar for his role as Dave, and the acting is great, his decisions just didn't make sense to me. Also, it felt foolish for Jimmy to shoot him after he'd already stabbed him and still had a knife \u2014 people can hear gunshots. Mystic River at times feels very 2003 \u2014 I'm not sure exactly what that means \u2014 but it gets better as it builds, even if the reveal of Katie's real killer was unsatisfying.",

            "content": "Clint Eastwood's directorial career went through a rough patch in the late 1990s and early 2000s with titles such as Blood Work (2002), Space Cowboys (2000) and True Crime (1999) receiving mixed to negative critical reception. This film is generally viewed as an upswing in his career as it received a Best Picture nomination and led to future successes such as Million Dollar Baby (2004) and American Sniper (2014). Sadly I found this film to be a real disappointment as it was a tonal mess and many of the supporting characters seemed underdeveloped leaving last minute twists feeling hollow and emotional outburst difficult to believe.\n\nAs an eleven year old boy Dave Boyle, Tim Robbins, is sexually abused by two men pretending to be police officer and a priest for four days. His two friends grow up to be gangster Jimmy Markum, Sean Penn, and police officer Sean Devine, Kevin Bacon. The three childhood friends are drawn back together when Markum's daughter Katie, Emmy Rossum, is brutally murdered as Devine is assigned to investigate the case and Boyle becomes the prime suspect due to having mysterious cuts on his body and having seen Katie the night of the murder. Devine is hesitant to accuse Boyle of having been the murderer as the evidence seems circumstantial but the fiery Markum is quick to assume that his assumptions are correct and after Boyle's wife Celeste, Marcia Gay Harden, expresses doubts about her husband's innocence he takes drastic action.\n\nThe film lost me in the fact that each of the three characters had underdeveloped \u2018personal problems'. Devine, possibly the least tortured character in the film, has been abandoned by his wife along with their child due to his valuing of his career over their family. She regularly calls him but remains silent, expecting him to say something, and we see that he increasingly struggles to speak with no response. This subplot does not receive an adequate payoff as Devine apologizes once and a woman who was seemingly traumatized and facing difficult emotions is suddenly ready to move back in with him and have him engage with her child. The idea of a lonely man being estranged from an unforgiving family member for vague reasons is better explored in Million Dollar Baby as we see what this rejection drives him to do and his problems remain unresolved. This is just one example of Devine feeling underwritten as although the naturally charismatic Bacon makes the character sympathetic and consistently watchable we feel slapped in the face when all of his conflicts are resolved inexplicably fast.\n\nMarkum and Boyle face the same problems as their relationships with their wives are meant to inform us of their mental states and what has pushed them to make drastic decisions such as murdering innocent men and stabbing pedophiles. Markum's wife Annabeth, played by the talented and versatile Laura Linney, is an underused character who gets one scene in which she is revealed to be a Lady Macbeth type who encourages her husband's violence and is sexually excited by it. This could be an interesting idea but the fact that it appears only once and in a scene filled with clunky dialogue means that it is hard to believe in their relationship and lines that should seem disturbing seem laughable. Similarly underused is Marcia Gay Harden, who received an Academy Award nomination for her performance as Boyle's wife, with her character seeming like a darker version of Lee Krasner in Pollock (2000). It is a shame that despite her best efforts she gets her juiciest lines in one awkwardly shot scene in which Robbins refuses to disclose what he was really doing the night of Katie's murder. Eastwood doesn't know how to slow down and let the two characters reveal their true feelings before having them yell at one another and raise eyebrows in an expression of suspicion. I wanted more out of the women in this film as we are told that they are important at the end of the film but never given any reason to believe so.\n\nFinally, the performances of Penn and Robbins were so over the top that it became impossible to believe them as real human beings. Penn is showy in every scene that he appears in with his sobbing when he discovers his daughter's death and killing of Robbins being some of his worst work. He is all tics and theatrical gestures with no depth as moments when he should reveal deeper hurt, a monologue about his love for his daughter and his fear of Robbins, display all of his weaknesses as an actor. Robbins is similarly over the top as he is not quite on point as a haunted, sad little man who wants to achieve some form of redemption. One gets the sense that if Eastwood had reined in a little their characterizations would have been deep and emotional moments would have landed with a stronger impact.",

He, along with Kevin Bacon and Tim Robbins play three childhood friends whose lives are laced with tragedy. With an intelligent, insightful screenplay and a riveting key performance, Eastwood has combined his cinematic ingredients in a mixture that is sure to get applauded. Mystic River is haunting and melancholy, and the portraits it paints of Jimmy, Dave, and Sean will stay with you after you have left the theater. In a time when the goal of most movies is to offer instant gratification with no aftertaste, this quality should be both valued and praised. Mystic River has only one misstep, and that occurs at the conclusion (and is reflective of problems with the book's final pages). Instead of ending cleanly, at the point when everything is in place for the rolling of the credits, the movie drags on for two unfortunate, unnecessary scenes. Nevertheless, this is a top movie.",

            "content": "Clint Eastwood's finest film is Mystic River.\n\nClint Eastwood's psychological mystery drama Mystic River (2003) is a harrowing journey of tragedy, trauma, and repression. Characters must deal with loss, grief, abuse, and accusations while under immense emotional pressure. Mystic River is honestly Eastwood's greatest film. He uses heavily nuanced storytelling to portray realistic people struggling with tremendous pain. Eastwood's direction just thrusts you right into the agony from childhood kidnapping to coping as an adult and brings Dennis Lehane's novel and Brian Helgeland's script to life. You are held in suspense on every word in each scene.\n\nI love how Eastwood uses shadows and dark lighting to hide or obscure faces on purpose. The lighting gives Mystic River a neo-noir feel akin to Zodiac, Spotlight, or Se7en. You never feel safe or sure. The Boston backdrop always feels potentially dangerous and dark. The narrative builds off of clues that Eastwood gives you to figure out what has happened, but I doubt you'll figure out the full truth in time. Mystic River's finale is shocking and affecting. The twists and reveals never seem to stop until you are just emotionally drained. Eastwood's direction is creative and engaging, while the brutal story is relentless. Mystic River is really Eastwood's film as he even scored it with brooding, ominous music to accompany the darkness on screen.\n\nSean Penn is truly astounding in how moving his Jimmy character is at displaying profound loss and agony. Penn plays a father mourning for his murdered daughter, while hunting her killer. His screams of rage and sorrow during his discovery of her body are haunting. Penn gives such a subtle performance of foreboding frowns and knowing glares. He earned that Best Actor Oscar he received for Mystic River. On the same note, Laura Linney is excellent as his supportive wife Annabeth with a darker tendency to overlook Jimmy's violent fury.\n\nLikewise, Tim Robbins is fascinating as a man, who experienced unimaginable childhood trauma, whose mind is deteriorating due to his inability to cope with what happened to him. Mystic River tackles childhood abuse with a careful and thoughtful perspective. It makes you feel like Robbins' character Dave is truly another victim in a long line of children taken advantage of by criminals. Robbins plays it cautious, anxious, frightened, confused, angry, and defeated as Dave. He is wonderful to watch, especially alongside Marcia Gay Harden as his sweet and devoted wife Celeste. She brings a warm chemistry with Tim Robbins that perfectly captures her character's timid nature and uncertain feelings.\n\nKevin Bacon is outstanding as a cop named Sean. His cold demeanor hides a layer of remorse and sympathy for his old friends played by Penn and Robbins. Bacon shines brightest in the end during a touching phone call from his estranged wife. Bacon pours on the nuance throughout Mystic River as he must cover his inner conflicted feelings of friendship and justice from his no nonsense partner Whitey, played by Laurence Fishburne.\n\nLastly, Mystic River features several cool cameos like Eli Wallach as the hilarious and surly shop keep. Emmy Rossum is lovely and endearing as the ill fated Katie. While she is on screen with Sean Penn, you really buy her as his daughter. Finally, Tom Guiry and Spencer Treat Clark as interesting as Katie's boyfriend and his mute brother, respectively.\n\nIn short, Mystic River is a numbing experience. You will feel assaulted by the sensory overload of apt casting, ambient scoring, complex acting, and riveting direction. Mystic River is a classic picture from Clint Eastwood.",

No attention or care is paid to the boy forced off the street and relegated to a basement hell for four days.  No one asked and no one cared.\nBut a lot apparently was happening in his head.\nPolice detective Bacon is determined to break every law of police procedure, which is not possible to do in Boston, circa 2003.  DNA is mentioned, but the power of DNA to find the killer of Robbins is feasible and there are witnesses alive.  No attempt is made to even investigate why Robbins died.\nLaura Linney, usually the best actor in Hollywood, goes batshit crazy at the end and tells her husband Sean Penn to do anything he likes -- good or bad -- and never admit to anything.  Linney makes your stomach turn.  One hopes she regrets making this bad film as it is the worst performance of her career.\nI could go on ad nauseam.  The film gets worse as it all concludes.  Life in Boston, as it is on much of the East Coast, seems even drearier and more pointless than it is.  The gray skies and rolling fog of the River Mystic encapsulate all that Eastwood has wrought ... and hopefully will evaporate it out of existence.",

On the surface it appears to be about the three men and their innocence lost mixed in with ideas about power, retribution and family bonds. The women in mystic river are in fact arguably the more integral part  Annabeth, cold in her manner seems to support whatever Jimmy does, she seems ruthless. Celeste seems to be losing her husband and turns from one of the most stable to the most unstable from start to finish and Sean's wife leaves him at breaking point whilst navigating the case.

Probably the most emotionally drenching film this side of Unforgiven. After Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, Eastwood seemed to have made less personal movies. But with Mystic River he's directed a movie reminding us that he was the guy who directed movies such as Bird, Unforgiven or the Bridges of Madison County. Mystic River is not a masterpiece but it's vintage Eastwood and it owes it to two things: the movie is shot with a real sense of what great classic filming is and the screenplay by Brian Helgeland. This screenplay develops lots of intersting themes: the transmission of evil through the links of blood and friendship, the way violence and the desire for revenge is reproducing eternally, the observation of small towns, their rumours, their boredom. The pessimism of the movie towards the part of evil there's in every human being is reminiscent of Fritz Lang. Overall, the tone is very dark but there's some funny moments, especially the cameo of Eli Wallach.",

I struggle to think of a movie that was trying THIS hard with so little to show for it. What else came out in 2003 that THIS pile of garbage got so many awards? The movie was so incomprehensible that I filled in the gaps and apparently came up with an entirely different movie in my head.\n\nMy wife watched this with me, and the book is one of her favorites.

The list was incredible. My understanding of each character and their motivation or backstory , as a movie watcher only, was entirely wrong. The characters that I thought were just generic background characters apparently were family of other characters or had some kind of significance that was lost on me.\n\nAnd holy moly, don't even get me STARTED on the audio mixing of this movie.

I barely understood 50% of what was said.I legitimately thought that \"young Robert Deniro\" Sean Penn was speaking in Japanese for 30 seconds in one scene and had to rewind to confirm he wasn't.  It's like the George Lucas special edition of audio cacophony. Every possible distracting and overly loud sound effect they could squeeze into a scene, they did. I feel like 2003 must have been the height of \"oh, everyone has surround sound now so well mix the SFX super loud since they'll have their own channel\". So If you're still working with stereo, avoid this movie.\n\nAnyway, my wife and I have been ranting about this waste of time and money long enough that I need to stop and try to forget this train wreck ever happened. I will finish by saying that this is the movie that made me add \"Can you refund an Amazon movie rental\" to my Google search history.",

Perfectly giving us each of their problems while focusing on the central story. Clint Eastwood directs Mystic River and it was in my opinion the beginning of him becoming the masterful director we know him as today.  Emmy Rossum of my favorite TV show since LOST is in this film. I keep digging into the crates and finding fantastic movies, making me disappointed in myself for never having seen them earlier. \n\nEveryone in this ensemble is acting his or her ass off, including Tim Robbins. Tim's character had a tragedy happen to him as a youth and it has made him a little weird as an adult. The way they keep certain things from you and focus on his idiosyncrasies is a bit like Gone Girl, pointing you in an obvious direction. Before they reveal a twist that you couldn't see coming, though there are hints throughout the picture. Kevin Bacon is quoted as saying it was his favorite film he has ever worked on and Sean Penn's scenes had me on the verge of tears. \n\nThank God for Clint Eastwood, who is sincerely focused on making great films and so often brings perfection to the screen. The scenes are a bit drawn out in this film, based on a book and the score is the perfect fit to that. The film was also scored by Eastwood! In the end you get a satisfying conclusion to this seemingly simple mystery the movie presented you in the beginning. The female characters are a bit off to me, yet they are both portrayed incredibly. & Even though the initial bit of Laura Linney's closing monologue is moving, the ends seems a tangled mess. So you wanted your husband to be a gangster? Regardless, the boys bring out the best in this movie",

Director Clint Eastwood has not only created something masterful here but he has also created a fact of losing something that means the world to you. How will you go to catch a killer? Would you kill your best friend if you thought he killed your daughter? I'll let you answer that, but it's like when Dave has changed in his personality, the whole group has changed. They still see each other but aren't as close as they use to be. But they seem to be missing it. (the movie doesn't tell you but you can sort of see it) There's a man in the movie who is named Just Ray, he does not appear but he gets mentioned in some conversations. He is believed to be one of Jimmy's associates, who done a robbery with him and was rumored to be living abroad.

            "content": "MYSTIC RIVER\n\nWhen someone tells me I should try to be a movie critic, I have my usual excuses-that it's too competitive a field, success would be unlikely, I'm not good enough, etc.  I have others such as the reluctance to write within the restraints of canning a movie without revealing what happens, layering the critique with how it was structured, what devices were used or left out, what I thought it meant, how the performances came off and so on.  I don't even like to read reviews much anymore, let alone write one. \n\nThe riveting \"Mystic River\" has inspired me but I think that what I want to write is not a movie review but an essay of praise.\n\nI learned long ago, after seeing \"Byrd,\"  that Clint Eastwood's towering talent lies in directing, not acting.  I heard Sean Penn say that Eastwood is the only Hollywood Icon he ever worked with that turned out to be the real thing.\n\nI am in awe of his directorial prowess.  I haven't read any of the reviews but was surrounded by the Four Star buzz, and when I go into a movie expecting it to be great, there is a 90% chance of my having nowhere to go but down.  This film fell in that rare 10% slot that delivered rather than disapponted.  Like Monster's Ball, it is too visceral for me to be eager for a second viewing. I probably will see it again at some point though, because a) I almost needed a translator for the pungent accents, b) I heard dialogue so mesmerizingly complex that I was either hopping on my toes or spinning out into a dream of my own weaving.  Like momentous classical tragedy, it challenges the viewer at every turn.\n\nSet in Boston, the story begins with three boys of about ten, playing stick hockey on an urban street.  One of them is taken into a car by that lowest of human existence, a pedophile.  The movie fast-forwards thirty years with the onset of a new tragedy and from there the drama emerges with relentless intensity.  The police/crime story is compelling and taut.  \n\nThe realism is gritty, the story complicated, and the gravity is that of Shakespearian  proportions but without his interweaving of comic relief.  This is, after all, the twenty-first century.\n\nI was gripped by the neck, ripped up one side and down the other, had my heart pulled out, pummeled, and jabbed back inside me with a juicy jolt.  I was happy.  I do love a hard-hitting work of art!\n\nAs in most of my favorites, truths of living are exposed.  This entails the juxtaposition of good/evil, joy/suffering, sublime/vile, understanding/misunderstanding, humanity/depravity.  In this film they are so richly simultaneous that there is no question of our shared human experience.  Like the marvelous book Siddhartha, we are an ever-running, ever-changing, ever-volatile river of weakness and righteousness.  Not only is nothing really black or white, the gray area is so mercurial and pulsating that it may carry significant flashes of insight and miscalculation, love and hate, surrender and prideful egoism...all within a moment's glance.  The river flows on unmitigated. \n\nPeople like to say, \"the book is always better.\"  They also say a picture is worth a thousand words.  In this case, the latter applies in the greatest sense.  The performances are true, strong, clear and have a conviction that runs concurrent with the integrity of the entire film.  Facial expressions carry the weight of entire chapters.  \n\nMovie fans may exit this movie with the belief that loyalty is the greatest of all virtues.  They may then wonder what boundaries loyalty has in the eyes of God or man.  They may also wonder--as I do--if the many questions of life are simply too ambiguous to be labeled, understood or answered by mere mortals.  Perhaps that \"explains\" an ending with some things clear while others remain enigmatic.  \n\nIf you go to the movies for special effects, escapism, or warm fuzzies, this is not the ticket for you.  If you regard film as experiencing an art form it is a must-see, as Eastwood is an artist of the highest order.",

I stumbled across it last night, but this time I watched it with subtitles. I'm not sure why I chose subtitles, but I'm glad I did. Whilst all the acting is perfection, it made me realise why Penn, Robbins, Fishburne and other actors of their caliber are so revered: They speak the lines clearly. There was one supporting actor in Mystic River who, whilst acting very well, I realised I was missing a lot of his dialogue. However, with subtitles, I got so much more of the plot! So much more, and I now realise why it's regarded as a masterpiece. Highly recommended!",

However, he proved everyone wrong, and his adaptation of Dennis Lahane's book boosted his career. Set in Boston, it begins in 1975 when a horrible incident changes the lives of Jimmy Markum (Jason Kelly), Sean Devine (Connor Paolo), and Dave Boyle (Cameron Bowen), when Dave is sexually assaulted by two men claiming to be policemen. 25 years later, and Jimmy (Sean Penn) is an ex-con who is running a store, Jimmy (Tim Robbins) is a blue-collar worker who is married to Celeste (Marcia Gay Harden), and Sean (Kevin Bacon) is a police detective working with Sergeant Whitey Powers (Laurence Fishburne). When Jimmy's 18 year old daughter Katie (Emmy Rossum) goes missing, and the same night it happened. Dave turned up late at home with blood on his hands, claiming he was attacked by a mugger. Jimmy suspects that Dave did it, or did he? It's a very dark mystery, but it has some brilliant performances in it, (Penn and Robbins won Oscars for their turns as broken men), it's not a film for everyone, but Eastwood's unfussy direction suits this style of film, and it was this and the Oscar success of Million Dollar Baby (2004) the following year that made Clint bankable again, and showed audiences what a fine director he is.",

It was an intricate story and a murder mystery that by the end ur pleading to know what really happened. Finally u find out what happened. At first I thought Dave had done it but I started to think I was stereotyping and I was. The movie def has some twists. Its easy to find someone guilty who only tells half truths even if they didn't do it. Watching this makes u realize how hard detective jobs are. also that cop realizes the 911 tape doesn't make sense with the her thing and I realized it before he said anything. I was unsettled by how Dave yet again gets victimized and nothing is done. He also gets in a car with two guys yet again when he shouldn't have. First of all the wife shouldn't have said anything to jimmy, she should've went to the police. Second of all the cop shouldn't just let his friend get off scot free bc they grew up together.",

It leads for the chilling interactions as old friends are pitted against one another, and the strength of the actors in those roles - Sean Penn, Tim Robbins and Kevin Bacon - certainly helps move the story along and make it as engaging as it turns out to be.\n\nAlso starring Laurence Fishburne, Marcia Gay Harden and Laura Linney, the film's bleak atmosphere sets a great tone for the horrid tragedies that plague this film. It's not a fun party film, but for those who like some really well-made drama with some unforseen twists (although the big answer becomes apparent reasonably early if you've seen this sort of film before), then this is the film for you.",

Combined with an superbly talented cast, Brian Helgeland's strong script and Tom Stern's (a frequent Eastwood collaborator) haunting cinematography that beautifully captures the dark, dreary atmosphere of a murder mystery, Eastwood delivers one of his finest directing efforts.\n\nFull review at http://silverscreenfanatic.com/2014/06/17/benjamins-stash-24/",

Sean Penn gives a really strong performance so much so that I feel his emotions being, put into this character. Tim Robbins plays a strong support character and by being the most damaged character of the movie. He portrays himself as psychologically damaged and emotionally devastated by his experience in his childhood. Finally Kevin Bacon plays in my opinion his best role I have ever seen, as the main detective on the case of the murder. His character is insightful, articulate, strong, soft, and dedicated to his job. I can say that I really liked this movie and can't find too many flaws. Though I will say, if you're wanting action, this movie will not deliver. This movie is more about the dialogue, characters, and performances.

            "content": "I have seen some dark, sad movies in my years. Ones that make me feel bad, make me feel sad, make me cry. Most of them, I have to say though, are Cllint Eastwood movies. Clint Eastwood is a master of film and this is one of his absolute best. But it's always interested me as to why he chooses to engross you into a film and make you feel terrible at the end. His films are not bad by any means but Unforgiven and Million Dollar Baby both were very depressing, and proved to make me feel unhappy at the end. Either the characters get what they don't deserve, die, or just end up turning bad. Good characters we care about that squeeze our hearts with pain whenever they die. It's hard to watch this, but films like this are amazing. When you feel depressed from a depressing movie really has something to say from the script and acting. The directing is what does this to you, and maybe a genre like this should be in it's own category. Because, truly, depressing films arent just dramas. They show the sadness in film and in the world we live in, and it affects us like no other ever will. Truly one genre that should be its own. And Eastwood perfects every bit of it.\r\n\r\n   Mystic River is a 2003 crime drama starring Kevin Bacon, Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, and Marcia Gray Haden. It's directed by Clint Eastwood and written by Brian Helgeland. I give major props to Helgeland for writing such a compelling and gripping tale. It's based off the book of the same name, but still holds up very well on the screen. The character development from the characters is excellent all due to the screenplay and how much time it gives each character and how much background we get from each into their professional and personal and intertwining lives. It's excellent the way he puts the characters together and how their lives seperate and come back. The dialogue is great and keeps you captivated through the film. Helgeland writes an excellent film not many other people write like. He doesn't give us what we want in this movie; justice. And as you watch the film's ending and final scenes, I think the film was great that way. Be writes great scenes, writes great tension, and writes a one of a kind film.\r\n\r\n   Clint Eastwood's direction, like I said, is stupendous. He truly pulls us into the screen and makes us believe that the tragedy that is in this film is a tragedy we experience ourselves. We feel the loss of the characters, the loss of the town, and the loss of the lives. Eastwood sends the film down a road that not many want to venture too, and not many viewers would go too. But every viewer should go down the road of the film, and every viewer will feel the pain that Eastwood wants you because honestly it's strong pain. One scene in the end shows two characters talking to each other, and a car is driving ahead of them as they remember an event that happened years ago. After we see the shot of the car, the film cuts back to the characters, the camera zooming away. As if it's leaving these two characters behind and leaving their souls and life their as well. Although Mystic River extremely lacks any amount of lightheartedness, Clint Eastwood still manages to entertain as the film indulges deeper and deeper into darkness instead of making us turn off the film and watch something more easier to watch. But nevertheless, this film is hard to watch. But Eastwood keeps us engaged and pulled into it like he has in no other film, directing better than he did Million Dollar Baby. And although some of his are huge and involve overly dramatic cinematography, there isn't much to complain about from his work. The score he uses in this film also works well, providing a theme that's sweeping, while using a simple melody. And while some of the film seems badly developed, it's some of the best direction I've seen in a while, despite some of the cinematography. But the true leader in this film is not wholly from the direction, but from the acting. The brilliant acting. Sean Penn gives the best performance I've ever seen from him second to only Milk. His pain is felt through out, and while I felt he over did it at times, by the end he was so good. And while he won Best Lead Actor at the Academy Awards, it wasn't him that lead the film; it was Tim Robbins. Tim Robbins plays a broken-down stay at home dad that the film's major events seem to lead too, and his portrayal of a man who was *SPOILERS* molested as a child was unlike anything I've seen him do. He was broken down, hopeless, haplessness, and in total already a dead man. His performance was so good, so well executed, and so real it helped me to understand the pain he felt, and he wholly deserves an Oscar for his performance. Kevin Bacon also gives one of the big performances, and he also does well, throwing the sensible and calm side of the film to the viewers and giving them a break whenever he was on screen. He also deserves an Oscar nomination for his performance, for it's memorable and also well done. Another outstanding performance comes from Marcia Gary Harden, who plays the wife of Tim Robbins. It's she who the films main villain might be, who leaves a man who should've been happy to sadness, therefore leaving the audience to sadness, and anger. I greatly disliked her character in this movie, and she portrays that hatred we are supposed to film on screen. Still, she's great, and deserves all the praise she can get for this film. All of the actors have one flaw though; their accents. While the accents seem authentic and real, they are also terribly hard to understand and takes me out of the movie sometimes. The cast in total is good, though, and so great and outstanding that they might possibly be one of the greatest ensembles I've seen on film.\r\n\r\n   In all, Mystic River is really good. Eastwood directs a film like no other out there, combining thrill with emotion at the same time like not many other films have. While your heart pounds from suspense, it also pulls its strings and its anger, providing a movie experience not like many other. One scene (or two scenes) in particular made the movie for me and proved it to be so good combining everything this movie felt like from start to finish. The acting was so good and was the most memorable part of the entire film, with Tim Robbins stealing the movie. And while some of the accents may be to strong, it was as good as it could ever be. The direction is overly dramatic at times, but then at others it works, and shows Eastwoods skill as a director like no other film of his has. In the end, this movie made me sad. It made me angry. It made me depressed. It made me feel hurt like no other film ever has. And I loved it gave me those feelings. 8/10.\r\n\r\nAnd please, if you are interested in hearing my thoughts or listening me talk more about this film, check out my podcast!

The pacing is spot on, and I'm pretty sure that I was exactly where Clint Eastwood meant me to be throughout the unfurling of the tale. But it's not a story to love, and there are a few things in the wrap-up that play a little thin. It's also surprising that as good as the acting is, with the exception of a scene early on with Penn I didn't feel that gut-wrenching anguish that, thinking back, I really should have. I will happily concede that Mystic River is, in one sense or another, a masterpiece; it's just not a film that will stick with me like a Shawshank.",

Every aspect of this film was firing on all cylinders: writing, acting, directing, cinematography, editing, sound and so on. For a drama, this is about as flawless as it comes. Sean Penn, Tim Robbins and Kevin Bacon lead this film in a truly fascinating direction and do so with supreme performances.

Kevin Bacon is also great and the sub-plot about him and his wife doesn't seem tacked on and unfolds quite nicely.

I absolutely LOVE this film and everything about it, the acting especially, the directing, the lighting effects (notice the great lighting in Dave's son's room when he's reading him a bed time story) the flow of the film, the story; EVERYTHING. Penn plays Jimmy Markum a tough, old school dude who's had a rough past life but now has a wife (Laura Linney) and three daughters, the oldest one being Katie (Emmy Rossum) Jimmy has two childhood friends: Sean who now is a cop (played by Kevin Bacon who never ceases to impress me with his acting) and the disturbed and troubled Dave (Tim Robbins) who now only just say 'hello'  every time they see each other. They end up being drawn back to each other after Jimmy's oldest daughter, Katie, is killed and then that's when the story really begins to unravel as to who killed Katie. \n\nEverything that unfolds towards the discovery of Katie's killer from getting clues, interviewing suspects and witnesses alike, and putting everything together is masterfully directed by Eastwood and expertly written by Brian Helgeland. These  clues and interviews are being conducted by Sean and Whitey (Laurence Fishburne in a very interesting role) you would think that the film drags while the plot unravels but not at all, it keeps you sucked in all the way to the surprising ending. \n\nBut the thing that keeps me coming to the film is not only the plot and directing, but the acting. Laura Linney plays Annabeth, Jimmy's wife, she brings calm to Jimmy's life and Marcia Gay Harden plays Celeste, Dave's wife who at times is confused about her husband's demeanor. Both Penn and Robbins deserved their Oscars that year because that scene where Penn runs towards the crime scene to see if its his daughter is powerful \"Is that my daughter in there?\" And the scene where Jimmy admits to Dave that its pissing him off because he can't cry for his daughter AND THEN finally does cry is emotional; its acting at its finest. The film is set in Boston and it  seems like filmmakers like filming there because we're seeing more and more films set there like GONE BABY GONE and THE TOWN most notably, its a great setting for a film. Overall if you want to see a powerfully acted, masterfully directed and well written film (which there are a few nowadays) you can't go wrong with this one. \n****",

Very deliberately and with purely circumstantial evidence she is deeply suspicious of her husband at the outset, and the message is telegraphed to anyone in the audience that isn't sleeping that she's gonna wind up ratting him out to Markum, even though she doesn't really know a thing about what really happened. So you watch it wondering when that's gonna happen, knowing that it'll be near the end because the s*%! is gonna hit the fan when she does. Also, near the end Markum's wife has some weird lines that sounded like total BS to me, and Lawrence Fishbourne's skeptical character is suddenly MIA. This all must've made sense on some late night brainstorming session when they were trying to figure out how to move the story along, but it didn't make sense to me. Other than that, it was fine. A flawed movie, not among Eastwood's best. Sean Penn does do fine work here tho.",

The thing that catches you is the acting proficiency of the principal actors; they took their time to study their characters, with Tim Robbins to me, being the most effective of them all.\n\nEastwood directorial prowess is showcased in this flick; he takes you on a Journey of social decadence, the pains of betrayal and the unlikely implication of child molestation. \n\nMystic River was shot in Boston, and it is an adaptation of the 2001 novel of the same name by Dennis Lehane.\nThe book and movie plot is about three boys who grow up as friends in Boston, Dave (Tim Robbins), Sean (Kevin Bacon), and Jimmy (Sean Penn). While the boys were playing around in the neighbourhood street Dave was abducted by child molesters who were pretending to be police officers. \n\nAfter days of regular molestation Dave escapes and finds his way back home, but the trauma of the molestation messed him up emotionally and mentally making him a little unstable and hard to understand.\n\n25 years in to the future Sean has grown to become a homicide detective, Jimmy is an ex-convict who currently runs a convenience store, and Dave has a blue collar job, still haunted by his abduction. Jimmy and Dave are related by marriage, with Dave marrying Jimmy\u00e2(TM)s sister.\n\nJimmy's daughter disappears one night and her body is found brutally murdered, coincidentally Dave comes home to his wife covered in blood and rattling that he fought off a mugger and \"bashed his head into the concrete\", and possibly killed him. Sean is then assigned to investigate the murder, and the three childhood friends meet up again.\n\nNominated for six Academy Awards, which Sean Penn won Best Actor and Tim Robbins won Best Supporting Actor (those where the two awards the movie went home with), making Mystic River the first film to win both awards since Ben-Hur in 1959.\n\nThe movie also won two Golden Globe Awards for Sean Penn and Tim Robbins, in the Best Actor and Best supporting Actor category. With Penn and Robbins wining many more accolades from other not so notable awardees.\n\nMystic River is a classic movie, that holds its own in the collation of greats, and it is one that I advice any movie lover to go buy this off the shelf. This is a DVD that you will like to tell others that you own.\n\nwww.lagsreviews.com",

All the praise and Oscars went to the overdone hamming of Penn, Robbins, and Marcia Gay Harden (who, to be fair, was given nothing to play but scaredy-cat.) It was embarrassing seeing the great Ms. Linney trying to make that bogus Lady Macbeth scene at the end believable. One of those movies that's trying to impress you rather than tell a story, which you're supposed to learn a lesson from. \"Life sucks\" is not an original message, nor one that will come as a great surprise to many people, but overpraised hack directors always seem to think they're doing something daring by trotting it out.",

Terrible events always seem to bring these three friends together and I felt like I had been punched in the face when it had finished. Sean Penn brings this energy that feels like the most powerful energy a man can emit. Tim Robbins made me feel so bad for the character of Dave. He did a great job of portraying the mentally deteriorated rape victim. Dave was the character that made me feel so sad. He is like the ultimate hero and ultimate victim of this whole movie. Jimmy's daughter may have been the one that was killed, but Dave was raped as a child, kills a pedophile in the act of molestation, is blamed for the murder of the daughter and is then killed by one of his childhood friends in an act of vengeance. I don't care how big of a stupid loose cannon Jimmy is. I felt like the death of his daughter was almost an excuse to get back into his old ways. I wish that Jimmy could get what was coming to him. Losing a loved one is painful, but this character has no excuse for murder. His accusations were purely based on blinding vengeance. I'm sure that several fathers would kill their daughters murderer which makes me feel like my incredible dislike for Jimmy is a little harsh. Look at this ramble! Eastwood just made me feel for his characters and got me emotionally indulged in his film. Such an accomplishment of acting by every character involved in this movie. Acted to perfection, directed to perfection and written to perfection, Mystic River touches on several issues of lost childhoods, loss and our relationships with others.

What this one did really well is instill the dark mood as loss in many different ways acts like a fog that covers the entire film. Overall, the story is really interesting. On the surface, it is simply a crime thriller where they try to find out who did it and what not, but it is also a representation of human suffering and tragedy. In many ways, it shows how these three troubled boys are not unscathed by the things that have happened to them and how all of them have suffered and will suffer profound losses that consume them entirely. I think the script by Brian Helgeland was fantastic and the direction from Clint Eastwood was really good as well. However, the real star is Sean Penn. I thought Tim Robbins and Kevin Bacon were pretty good in their roles here, but Sean Penn stole the entire show. His performance was absolutely marvelous and he really drew you into him, which makes his role in the film all the more believable. It is not surprise that he won for Best Actor.\r In terms of complaints, I see a lot of user reviews calling this one boring and slow, ham-handed, pretentious, and predictable. The only one I can sort of agree with is predictable, though I did not figure it out until the people in the film did (well, part of it, I figured out one part of it early on, but I think we were supposed to). Plus, I do not have a problem with predictability. In addition, this one was anything but boring. It is slow, yes, but it was a perfect showcase of acting and script-driven film. The intensity and sadness of this one were also top-notch and really helped quell any boredom that may set in. As for it being ham-handed or pretentious, no. I honestly do not understand that criticism at all. At no point did I ever find it to be either of those things. It tries to tackle bigger purposes, yes, but that does not mean it is pretentious, especially when it covers it well.",

You still want the best for them, even if you can't root for them, if you can't stand beside them and say \"I stand for the same ideals that this person stand for.\" You want to know who killed Katie, and you don't want it to be Dave, but do you root for Dave to win? Do you root against whoever you think killed Katie? No. This is an incredibly difficult film to watch, and it will not make you smile. It will make your heart sink, and your eyes tear up. It is so very powerful, and delivers such a strong message, it remains impossible not to watch. The acting is phenomenal, and while both Penn and Robbins won Oscars, the show is stolen by Robbins, who turns in one of the best supporting performances I've ever seen (on par with something out of the Godfather).

The truth, unfortunately, is that it seems difficult to maintain these friendships for so many years. As we change, asThere are childhood friends who are inseparable and whose friendship lasts a lifetime, but I think they are exceptions. The truth, unfortunately, is that it seems difficult to maintain these friendships for so many years. As we change, as life changes us, we create and build facets of our personality that may, or may not, match well with our friends. Thus, the friends end up moving away because they don't understand each other like they used to. In addition, each one's own life course moves people away and closer, and the friends that childhood brought us will probably follow their lives away from us. I myself, thinking about my childhood, remember nostalgically the faces of those friends that I never saw again, and who followed their lives along paths that separated us. I can only hope, and wish, that they are well, wherever life has taken them.The story follows the lives of three Boston kids named Dave, Jimmy and Sean. Their lives are marked by a day when Dave is kidnapped and subjected to horrific sexual abuses. Years later, Jimmy's eldest daughter turns up dead, after a few hours missing. The investigation, led by Sean, who became a policeman, will focus precisely on Dave, who maintains a suspicious attitude and seems to have something to hide. But Sean must hurry to find out the truth, as Jimmy is determined to take matters into his own hands.This film talks about how life separates friendships, about how small moments can be decisive. Simple things, like getting into a car we never should have, or waiting a day before taking action. Clint Eastwood's meticulous direction combines perfectly with Helgeland and Lehane's impeccable script for a film that is truly memorable. It is a film with difficult themes, which make us think. The theme of friendship, of the way life shapes and changes us, is for me the center of the film, although it passes discreetly under another theme, which is that of sexual abuse perpetrated by pedophiles. It's a film made during the pedophilia scandal that shook Boston and its Catholic community, so it was a very current topic at the time (still is, let's face it).The film has a luxury cast, which is fully committed to work. Sean Penn does an impeccable job, perhaps one of his best works, having rightly deserved the Oscar for Best Actor, which he got with this performance. Equally impressive, Tim Robbins could hardly have done better, also earning the highest award in the film industry. Kevin Bacon presents himself in a much more restrained and discreet register, but equally powerful and effective. Also noteworthy is the impeccable work of Marcia Gay Harden and Laura Linney, and the excellent help of Lawrence Fishburne.Personally, I think Eastwood's films aren't the most remarkable in the most technical aspects. He is a director who knows how to privilege the story told, the work of the actors, the building of atmosphere, suspense and tension. However, being meticulous as he is, we must be aware of the effective way he uses cinematography and camera work to create tension: that scene where Dave is taken away and sees his friends left behind is simply anthology-worthy, and we don't need more words to understand what will follow in the life of that innocent character. Also the editing and mixing was done impeccably. Finally, a word for the soundtrack, which does not stand out or stay in the ear, but is perfect in the effort to create and work on suspense and dramatic tension.",
