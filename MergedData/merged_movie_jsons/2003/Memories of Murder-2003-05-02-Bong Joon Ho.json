            "content": "Joon-ho Bong directs \"Memories of Murder\". A police procedural, the film's first act flows along conventional lines. Here a murder takes place and detective Park Doo-Man is assigned to the case. He's a hotshot cop, hardworking and determined, who thinks he can spot a criminal simply by \"looking into their eyes\". Joon-ho Bong, however, repeatedly questions Park's abilities. Early in the film, for example, Park's commander points at two men at the far side of a room and asks Park to pick out the criminal. Park looks deeply into each man's eyes, but before he gives his answer, the director cuts to black. We assume that Park has picked the right guy.But 20 minutes into the film, and our faith in Park begins to crumble. Indeed, he begins to come across as a bit of an idiot. He's deeply superstitious, relies on fortune tellers, believes in hunches, and is highly insecure.At this point the film introduces another detective. His name is Sae Yoon, and he's been assigned to help Park on his case. The film's second act is thus a repetition of the first act, Sae Yoon re-enacting all the scenes that we just witnessed Park do. The way Park handles the film's first crime scene is contrasted with how Sae Yoon handles the film's second crime scene. The way Park handles an interrogation is contrasted with how Sae Yoon handles an interrogation. In seeing how a methodical, clever and genuinely skilled detective like Sae Yoon handles his job, the audience is forced to reconsider their views of Park. Maybe Park wasn't a hotshot cop after all. The juxtaposition between the way the two men handle the film's first two murders forces us to re-evaluate our perceptions.This notion of reassessing what our eyes see, is constant throughout the film. A mentally ill kid seems like a likely suspect, but is actually not. A local pervert seems like the killer, but is actually a caring husband. An effeminate loner may be the rapist, but DNA samples prove otherwise. Detective Sae Yoon, himself a \"by the books\" cop, eventually becomes a violent, loose cannon, determined to throw away rules and regulations based on a hunch, whilst Park, the very cop who consults shamans and witch doctors and stages false confessions, becomes the film's voice of law-abiding righteousness.And so it is the way the film's characters are constantly in a state of moral flux that makes \"Memories of Murder\" so exciting. The audience is constantly asked to \"look the characters in the eyes\" and reassess what they're seeing.But what makes the film great is its ending. If surface perceptions are inadequate, then how can we truly understand another human being? If personal emotions get in the way of objective truth, how can we ever trust our own acuity? And so because the criminal is never identified or caught, suddenly everyone is guilty. There can be no closure because everyone, police included, is implicated. Watch how the director contrasts the film's first shot (the innocence of a child's face) with the film's final shot (the retired face of detective Frank staring down the camera and directly at the audience). Frank's catch phrase, \"look into my eyes\", now takes on a whole new level of meaning. He's a cop again, and everyone including we the audience are now under suspicion. And so while most serial killer films end with closure, or in the case of the recent \"Zodiac\", with the comfortable knowledge that our killer is now old and largely impotent, \"Memories of Murder\" leaves us on a note of profound paranoia. We're left uncomfortable, disturbed, and everyone now seems a potential suspect. 8.5/10 \u2013 Though it isn't brave enough to stray far from genre conventions, this is a stylish, engrossing film. Worth two viewings.",

            "content": "This is probably the best crime thriller I've seen since \"Insomnia,\" and contains the most haunting climax of any serial killer flick since \"Seven.\" But like most films reaching for greatness, this is most admirable for its striking details.The filmmakers here craft a taut, careful, and delicately strung together motion picture that relishes in its amazing development of mood, place, and character.First, the mood: Haunting cinematography (rain falling on a small village at night, shadows darting across a thick field of grass, figures lurking in the woods, a masterfully choreographed hot pursuit scene on foot), a poignant music score (aided by the creepy use of a Korean pop song that accompanies each murder), and no-nonsense direction (peppered with fabulous doses of comic relief--how Shakespearan!) keep the film more and more intriguing at each turn and fascinating to watch.Second, the place: South Korea, circa the late 1980's, and apparently under some sort of militia rule. This is inspired by the true story of Korea's first publicized (and still unsolved) serial killer case. This unique time and place serves as a wonderful respite from the typical American big-city setting of so many other films of this ilk.Finally, the character development: The small details revealing the haunted souls of the detectives on the case is nothing short of brilliant. Witness the tiny executions of minutae: The cloth one rogue cop wraps around his boot so as not to leave scars when he kick-boxes suspects into submission, the harried chief of police checking his own blood pressure while trying to keep his off-the-cuff detectives in line or fighting to keep headline-starved reporters at bay, the young female officer desperately trying to showcase her abilities in crime solving between serving the chauvinistic detectives cups of fresh coffee, the outsider detective from Seoul's insistence that documents never lie (and the brutal irony at the climax that challenges his entire sense of being), and the main village detective's scathing speech on the difference between American FBI agents and Koren policemen. The beauty is in the details, and this film, like all the great ones, revels in their uncovering.One flaw is that some might find the film a bit long in the tooth, but this is not to be missed for fans of serial killer thrillers and police procedural movies. For the Korean filmmakers, and the amazing cast...this is their master stroke.",

            "content": "I'm one of those people who tend to think that South Korean movies are perhaps a bit too slow-paced for my taste. Memories of Murder isn't a fast-paced film, by any means, but this time the slow pace made this movie about an investigation of serial killings so much better than 95% of its American counterparts.Essentially, Memories of Murder is a drama first with thriller and comedy elements (yes, in the first hour or so the movie is actually quite funny). Kang-ho Song and Sang-kyung Kim are brilliant as the two cops who have drastically different views on how to solve a crime. The character development is fascinating and believable thanks to a great script.Highly recommended.",

Things quickly mushroom with the discovery of more bodies, more suspects and no end in sight.Whether you like police films or not you should see this movie about the real hunt for Korea's first known serial killer simply because its a great movie. This is a movie that alters your expectations and changes your view of things. Its impossible to guess whats going to happen simply because the twists and turns are so unexpected. At times this is a funny funny movie, especially if you like shows like Law and Order or CSI since what we take for granted in those shows is stood on its head. At other times this is a very taut thriller and you become as desperate as the police in needing to put an end to the madness.On top of all of this is a picture of Korea in 1986, a place with political unrest and civil defense drills that for me at least makes it seem like something out of the 1950's.This is brilliant brilliant film-making.I've given the film an 8 out of 10, even though it probably deserves to be higher, simply because some 12 hours after seeing the film, I'm still pondering what I thought of it, how good is it? At least an 8. I'm sure a second and third and fourth viewings will change my mind.Yea its that good",

            "content": "Greetings again from the darkness. Between 1986 and 1991, 10 women were raped and brutally murdered in the province of Gyeong-gi outside Seoul. Considered South Korea's first serial killer case, the crime went unsolved until 2019. The case was the inspiration for writer-director Bong Joon Ho's second feature film, as was Kwang-rim Kim's play, \"Come to See Me\". Director Bong Joon Ho co-wrote the screenplay with Sung-bo Shim, and of course, went on to win an Oscar for PARASITE (2019), in addition to providing other popular features such as OKJA (2017), SNOWPIERCER (2013), and THE HOST (2006). This early film can be compared to David Fincher's ZODIAC (2007), although this one is a blend of murder mystery, crime thriller, black comedy, and political commentary.Kang-ho Song (PARASITE) stars as Park, a local detective called to the scene of the first victim. Almost immediately we can tell Park and the police force are borderline incompetent. Park is convinced he has \"Shaman eyes\" and can identify the guilty party simply by looking at them. Of course, this is ridiculous and is proven so on a few occasions. Park's partner, Detective Jo, is a hothead who takes a heavy-handed approach to interrogation (though he later experiences true karma). When a second victim is discovered, a more seasoned professional, Detective Seo, arrives from Seoul. In contrast to Park's gut-feeling approach, Seo puts faith in evidence, proclaiming, \"Documents never lie\". These two detectives are at the core of the story and we watch as each evolves.The film begins on October 23, 1986 as the body of the first victim is found. We witness how the crime scene is immediately corrupted by both cops and local kids. This is also our indoctrination to how the filmmaker is treating this much differently than most crime dramas. A stream of suspects Park refers to as \"punks\" are paraded through the station, but true chaos ensues at the scene of the second body. We can't help but be relieved when a professional, big city detective arrives. Bits of evidence are slowly assembled - red clothes, rainy nights, a song on the radio - each may play a role in the actions of the killer. Frustration builds as more murders occur and the detectives are unable to pin down the perpetrator.The mental and physical toll that detectives endure with such a case are on full display. The obsession with finding the murderer never ends and the fantastic ending proves that even a career change doesn't erase the failure. We are inundated with crime thrillers these days, but it's difficult to grasp how this masterpiece was put together by a director whose career was just getting started. Certainly today we recognize the brilliance of Bong Joon Ho, but this was 17 years ago! It plays as a time capsule of South Korea socially and politically in 1986, and it works on that level every bit as much as a crime thriller. Cinematographer Hyung Koo Kim (THE HOST) balances the crime scenes with the police station, as well as the telling facial expressions of the characters. Last year's solving of these horrific crimes pushed this classic into release, and it's well worth a watch.",

            "review_title": "A Gritty Murder Mystery with Political and Social Overtones",
            "content": "\"Memories of Murder (Salinui chueok)\" is an involving, cross-cultural take on the \"L.A. Confidential\" noir genre of a murder mystery with a political filter, layered with elements that gritty British TV detectives have mastered, from \"Prime Suspect\" on.While co-writer/director Joon-ho Bong uses the conventions of the contrasting buddy cop movie, sometimes simplistically for comic effect, he has more social commentary on his mind than a captivating investigation into a serial killer and avoids the usual titillating gore fest.Set specifically in 1986, the film visually captures the changes in industrializing, modernizing and politically restive South Korea, where new, dark, noisy factories were sprouting up in the middle of agricultural areas. From the opening shot that could be out of \"Witness,\" we see a peasant bring what looks like a city sophisticated cop to a crime scene.But that's just the start of the conflicting comparisons. We've seen enough \"CSI\"s to sympathize with him immediately as he hopelessly tries to secure the crime scene for clues despite a Keystone Cops-incompetent forensics and investigative team who keep sliding into the irrigation ditch. But he starts to seem a bit of a buffoon to us as he gives more credence to gossipy tips from his girlfriend than clues from the scene and he manufactures \"evidence.\" Our sympathies are curdled even more as we see him conduct an old-fashioned coercive interrogation of a developmentally disabled suspect -- and he's the good cop. Even without knowing anything about Korean law, it certainly looks like they are compromising the investigation, as his thug partner, who is nowhere as complex as Russell Crowe's Bud White, gets as out of control as a cartoonish \"Lethal Weapon\" cop, and that cop never grows and develops in the story beyond being a brutality enforcer so becomes a pathetic comic figure. Their complicit boss just seems ineffectual as he's clearly over his head with this kind of murder investigation.But through the background TV broadcasts of demonstrations and civil defense alerts and drills, we gather that their interrogation procedures were more developed through oppressing political dissidents and forcing confessions than professional criminal detective work. Ironically, they ultimately can't get the resources they need in this difficult case because of these politically-drummed up time-consumers, especially for manpower and sophisticated forensic tools that they have to beg from the FBI.The film changes tone and settles down into an intellectual thriller as a classic big city detective is sent from Seoul, and we have some of the interchanges we've seen in \"In the Heat of the Night\" and in \"Insomnia,\" as the first cop now seems even more of a simpleton in his standard operating procedures of relying on his knowledge of the locals and instincts about human nature (though even a fellow officer teases him about whether he can tell apart a rapist and victim's brother), while the city guy is looking and listening for clues and real evidence, like a Korean \"Dalziel and Pascoe.\" But the tension is ramped up as the killer keeps killing \u0096 and the film starts showing us the murders as they are about to happen just as the cops are getting hints about his modus operandi and even after the police are on alert. Their frustration at not being able to stop him is grippingly conveyed by the lead actors, as each starts to abandon their usual procedures out of mounting frustration, and by the editing.A droll side bar is that the macho team is given a key clue by a policewoman who they otherwise relegate to getting them refreshments. Their macho attitudes also keep them from learning vital clues from the marginalized men they pick up as suspects.The coda in contemporary Korea is effective, reinforcing a sense of societal complicity is letting such murders happen and go on, though I was curious what happened to the city cop as well as the local guy. I had no idea until I read the IMDb message board that this was a based on a real case, so I appreciate even more that a cheap ending wasn't tacked on.The cinematography and editing are terrific throughout, with many of the scenes in the dark and rain. Particularly dramatic are harrowing scenes along railroad tracks and a tunnel that are reminiscent of stark imagery from Mervyn LeRoy's \"I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang.\" It is frustrating for English subtitle readers that not more of the Korean on the screen, such as newspaper headlines or heard, such as the TV broadcasts and pop tunes, isn't translated.",

Detective Park Doo-Man (Kang-ho Song) and Detective Cho Yong-koo (Roe-ha Kim), two brutal and stupid local detectives without any technique, investigate the murder using brutality and torturing the suspects, without any practical result. The Detective Seo Tae-Yoon (Sang-kyung Kim) from Seul comes to the country to help the investigations and is convinced that a serial-killer is killing the women. When a third woman is found dead in the same \"modus-operandi\", the detectives find leads of the assassin.\"Salinui chueok\" is a very realistic movie based on a true story. The performances are stunning, showing the flaws of a Third World police department in a country under dictatorship, without respect to the human rights, using torture to force the confession and without skilled agents and resources. Unfortunately the identity of the killer is not disclosed and the unsolved investigation gives a sensation that the films has not finished. I am really impressed with the excellent quality of South Korea cinema, with the movies that have been released in Brazil in the last years.

The story (about real-life killings of 10 women in Korea during the 1986-1991) is compelling enough, but the actors (Song Kang-ho cuts you deep even when he's silent, and his big-city partner offers emotional jolts at the end), the director (effectively plays some scenes in docu-style approach), the cinematography (a shadow creeps out in the paddy field will give you, well, creeps. big one.), and the music (haunting) are welcome bonuses.One scene that impresses me most is the crime-scene midnight chase between a suspect, 2 local detectives, and a big-city detective (who doesn't know his local partners are there watching him).

The senior police detective is out planting evidence, his belligerent sidekick routinely beats and tortures suspects, and people brought in for questioning admit to crimes they're completely innocent of. It's all very disorienting and doesn't make a lot of sense until about the second half of the movie when the detectives hunker down and involve themselves in routine but exhausting police work.Regarding planted evidence, feeble minded suspect Kwang-ho (No-shik Park) might have been able to out Detective Park (Kang-ho Song) for his dishonest methods if he'd been able to differentiate the underside of his left foot sneaker with the picture the detective showed him of a right shoe footprint. If you go back and check that scene, you'll see that the physical shoe couldn't have made the print in the 'evidence'. The correct sneaker would have made a reverse image print in the dirt.It's kind of ironic actually that the big break in the case occurs because a lowly female desk officer makes a connection between a sad song played on a radio station and rainy nights when a serial killer's murders occur. This while Detective Park is crystallizing his theory about crazy hairless men (trust me, you have to catch that!).When everything finally comes together and the detective on loan Seo Tae-yoon (Sang-kyung Kim) closes in on the suspected serial killer, the rug is pulled out from under him and the viewer with the information from America that the DNA sample sent in is not conclusive. It points to another irony in as much as Seo's insistence on the infallibility of 'written documents' is torn to shreds. At that point, one feels helpless over Park Hyeon-gyu's (Hae-il Park) get away, since most of the circumstantial evidence pointed to him as the killer.I didn't know this film was about a real life serial killer case that went unsolved in South Korea in the Nineties. In fact, I didn't even know about the picture until I ran across it on one of the IMDb top film lists. Fortunately, I'm glad I kept an open mind enough despite the dubious outset, because the story turned out to be a provocatively intriguing one, even if no resolution occurred as a result. The closing scene inspires closure and doubt at the same time, a unique conclusion to a murder mystery that remains unsolved in real life.",

            "content": "Beginning in the fall of 1986 and continuing for the next four years South Korea was haunted by the nation's first recorded serial killer. Preying upon women in a remote rural community the killer was both vicious and meticulous, strangling his victims with their own undergarments and leaving nothing of any use to the police investigating the crimes. The killer was never caught.I do not envy any director trying to make a true crime film, particularly not one so high profile and so recent that the crimes still live on in the public consciousness. Stray too far in one direction and you devolve into saccharine sentimentality, go the other direction and you risk crass exploitation. Director Bong Joon-Ho avoided both of these traps by charting an altogether different route: he has made a film that is not about the killer or the crimes or the victims but one that is purely about the police officers charged with the case and the devastating emotional toll it took on their lives. In charting his unusual route Bong has created a bleak masterpiece, one that took home a stack of film awards in its native land but which has been largely neglected on these shores until now.The film begins with the first body discovered, a woman strangled with her own stockings, raped, tightly bound, and hidden in a drainage culvert. The detective in charge of the case is Park Du-Man (Song Kang-Ho) and it is immediately clear that he is out of his depth, that the entire local police force, in fact, are out of their depth. The crime scene is chaos, crowded by reporters and locals trampling over potentially vital evidence. Park himself is not what you'd call a systematic investigator, scoffing at the scientific approach and trusting in his supposedly unerring eye at picking out criminals just by looking at them. He relies on swagger and bravado and the brute force of his uneducated assisting officer Jo Yong-Gu.Serving as a foil to Park and Jo is Seo Tae-Yun (Kim Sang-Kyung) a detective from Seoul who has volunteered to assist with the investigation. Seo is the polar opposite of Park - methodical and rational - and it takes mere moments for the two to clash, clashes that lead to the two of them overlooking some key pieces of evidence.As the film progresses and the body count continues to rise you can feel a sense of desperation slowly settle over the department. Under educated, under manned and woefully under equipped the local force is simply not up to the task. As the realisation that they will not find the evidence they so badly need begins to set in Park and Jo resort to planting evidence to bring in suspects Park picks out with his 'keen eye', suspects they then set out to extract coached confessions from. The process inevitably leads to public humiliation. Soon even Seo begins to lose his faith in reason and just as things bottom out they finally catch a break and settle on a prime suspect, one who truly appears likely to be their man. But can they make it stick? What sets Memories of Murder apart from the crowd are the rich performances from its leads and the sure hand of Bong Joon-Ho. Bong knows exactly what he wants to do with this film and he steers the ship with a firm hand. He has a keen eye for imagery but he consistently avoids the cheap resolve, the quick hit, in favour of a slowly building mood and the film is all the stronger because of it. Song and Kim are both stellar in their roles, giving their characters much needed depth. You can feel their frustration and helplessness continually growing and when the final crushing blow is delivered you can feel their utter despair at being abandoned by a system that they have given their lives to. Bong isn't just asking how this could happen, how someone could be as evil as this killer, but how could a government allow this to happen? How could the police not be given the tools and manpower they so obviously needed to protect the people? The DVD release has been given the standard Palm treatment. The transfer is strong and presented in anamorphic widescreen. The film is presented with both the original Korean language track in 2.0 stereo and an English dub in both 2.0 and 5.1. The English subtitles are solid, clearly translated and easy to read. The disc also includes a reel of cast and crew interviews discussing their characters and the creation of the film as well as an extensive reel of deleted scenes.Memories of Murder is a minor masterpiece, a film that moved Bong immediately onto Korea's A-list of directing talent. It is richly detailed, beautifully performed and disturbing in precisely the way that people need to be disturbed in from time to time. Don't miss it.",

            "content": "Since a synopsis would be redundant here, I'll confine myself to praise alone.Each positive comment that precedes this is accurate. I watched this movie yesterday. I couldn't take my eyes off it. Everything taking place on screen was riveting, from the simple act of walking down a dark lonely road in the rain, to a wild chase by three desperate detectives. This movie held me in thrall.As a new viewer of Asian movies, I try to analyze the reason I tend not to be interested in western works any longer. I finally came to the conclusion that it has to do with the accessibility of the players. They seem to be people first, actors by choice, and stars, by the public making them so.In Memories of Murder, I saw this human factor almost too painfully. By the end of the story, I was in tears. Even now, the mood prevails. It's been so long since these crimes took place, and I don't know absolutely that they remain unsolved, but I think it's the case, and I think about that, and how frustrating it still must be to those who worked on the case.The actors have become the people in my mind, and the horrible sense of defeat that becomes palpable eventually, is heartbreaking. When one relates to the inroads made on the health; mental and physical; of the detectives, who are ultimately portrayed as tireless and completely dedicated to the case, you realize that you've watched something that is historic. You have seen the probable truth.The way this movie draws you into it, so that you are walking through dangerous rain, with a warning shout in your throat, points to the brilliance of the director and the players.It is difficult to say, \"I love this movie\", just as it is hard to say, I love Silence of the Lambs, because love is a peculiar word to use for such fare.But yes, I love it for the fact that during it, I was in a small village in South Korea in a terrible era of sirens blaring, military dictatorship, and the hopeless pursuit of a serial killer. I landed back here in this time and place with a thud, only after turning off the DVD player, and going to the kitchen for a glass of water. While I was caught there mentally---I felt the desperation, and I felt the defeat and the sorrow of the detectives, who were essentially decent enough human beings when all was said and done.There are not many movies that can time-travel you into their present. This will do it.I most seriously recommend that you view the interviews with the director and the stars (all of them are stars of a special kind in my mind) in order to dispel some of the hold the story will have on you.These are incredibly interesting people, and it's a sheer joy to see them smiling and peaceful. They're intelligent, educated and articulate. The younger members of the cast, the less seasoned, are so beautiful in their desire to do it right.They definitely did it right. They were wonderful, and they thanked the interviewer. How lovely that was to see.I watched the movie using the English subtitles rather than the English dubbing because I wanted the authenticity. The subtitles were very good.",

Everything is portrayed as cramped, squalid and thoroughly grimey. The cinematography is great all the way to the end, as is the music, costume, set design and acting. There is a good dose of comedy in many scenes, which I didn't expect in this sort of story. It works well.It's a rock-solid piece of cinema with characters that never fall into good guy / bad guy stereotypes. It's much more thoughtful than it initially lets on, hiding a complex theme behind a seemingly straightforward cop thriller. Will watch again.",

Rain, solitude, quietness, the vastness of the grassland, the depth of a tunnel, all tainted by sepia colored lenses.In this film Bong Joon-ho proves that he not only is an incredible storyteller, but also master in composition and camera movement. One of the finest examples is the scene where a new body is discovered. Here, the director unfolds the situation with a long take through the grassland, taking us on a trip in the disaster that Detective Park Doo-Man is going through as reporters get into the murder scene, a tractor erases a footprint, police officials falling as they try to get to the place, etc.One of the biggest achievements resides in its pacing, achieving a subtle and brief change of moods, the film takes its risks with the ludicrous methods of Detective Cho Yong-koo without making the viewer think that some particular scene is out of place. The chase scene inevitably comes to my head as another prove of Bong Joon-ho ability with the camera, as he doesn't abuse any resource, he sneaks it by switching between quick cuts and long takes.Bong's films are always impregnated with a political background that includes class struggle, heavy bureaucracy, corruption & civil guard brutality. The Host, Mother, Snowpiercer, Okja are clear examples of this and Memories of Murder isn't an exception. South Korean police force is depicted as an inefficient and arrogant law enforcement political arm that isn't capable of accepting the case is beyond their capabilities and these feelings of discomfort and anger caused by the police's negligence are exacerbated by the political scenario South Korea was experiencing.My final word on this masterpiece is the tunnel scene. It makes the film's final transition from what began as a crime thriller to an exasperating psychological and sorrowful cinematic experience as we grow fond with our desperate protagonist, in what seems to be his last try to see through the eyes of the number one suspect, which ends in a frustrated attempt to solve the case. This takes us to the ending of Memories of Murder, which I will say is one of the most powerful ever seen on film... as detective Park Doo-Man looks straight into the camera, breaking the fourth wall and sorrowfully starring at the audience, looking one last time for those indistinct murderous eyes within the average crowd.10/10.",

Song Kang-ho delivers a fantastic performance as the local lead detective; his character manufactures evidence, pursues harebrained ideas, and tries to beat confessions out of suspects (along with his buddy, played well by Kim Roi-ha). He's oafish, inept, and immature, and so it's no wonder when he feels threatened when a smarter detective from Seoul arrives (Kim Sang-kyung). It's also pretty hilarious that when they meet, he attacks the newcomer with the leaping double-leg kick, thinking he's attempting to assault a young woman.Perhaps most damning, his desire to declare the killer has been found outweighs in his mind the possibility that he really hasn't been, or that stripping someone and torturing them has resulted in a false confession. As the killer always seems a step ahead, it's very interesting to see the arc that these guys go through over the course of the investigation, and to Bong's credit, there is a humanizing progression. I also loved the quiet female police officer (Go Seo-hee), who shows such a counterpoint to the heavy-handed masculine approach. The tunnel scene towards the end is brilliant, and seemed to mirror not only the previous \"documents don't lie\" statement from the detective from Seoul, but also the tunnel vision the detectives had at times over the course of the investigation. And man, that end shot is haunting.",

The victims are all beautiful young women whose bodies have been found raped and strangled in local fields and ditches. The initial agents who have been put on the case are two incompetent bunglers - one a dropout from college, the other a dropout from high school - who seem to have gleaned the majority of their investigative techniques from cheesy TV crime dramas. Enter Seo Tae-yoon, a forensic investigator from Seoul, who wrests control from the locals and brings some big-city know-how to the case.Given the grim subject matter at hand, it's amazing just how funny so much of this movie turns out to be. Blessed with a sly sardonic humor and a willingness to make fun of its characters even while evincing a great deal of affection for them, \"Memories of Murder\" plays less like a conventional cop movie and more like a regional comedy filled with rich insights into the subtle truths of human nature. The relationship between Seo, the investigator from Seoul, and Park Doo-man, the more rational of the two local officers, is intriguing and complex, as we watch them bicker and brawl and engage in petty power struggles, while slowly coming to realize that each has something of value to teach the other if only they can set aside their egos long enough to listen. Saddled with even-then antiquated technologies, Seo and Park are forced to rely on good old investigative footwork and informed intuition to try and solve the case.There are strong performances by one and all, and a fine sense of atmosphere in the setting. Those looking for a neatly tied-up resolution to the case may find themselves disappointed at movie's end. But the rich rewards of setting and character should be compensation enough.",

'Memories of Murder' seemed to be the audience favourite so I decided to start there. Although they are quite different films, I would say I liked 'Memories of Murder' a little more. This had almost everything I like in a movie. A gripping story, little moments of understated (yet hilarious) humour (much the same as 'Parasite' heavily featured) and some beautiful cinematography. This is a brilliant film.Before seeing this I wondered why such a wonderfully well reviewed film hadn't gotten an American remake as yet. After seeing it I understand. There's the fact that this was based on a South Korean serial killer, and also the fact it is loosely based on 'From Hell' which is already a film, but no, the main reason the Americans could never remake this is because it doesn't have a definitive ending. And it's not like the Americans could just add one in because the fact that there is no definitive ending is the entire point of the film.I love an ambiguous ending (and don't even get me started on how brilliant the final shot of this film is) but I'll admit I wanted a conclusive ending on this one. Don't get me wrong, I fully understand that was specifically the point, but that's how well this film was crafted. I needed to know the answer as badly as the character needed to as well. Most films that go over two hours I'm pretty anxious for them to finish near the end. With this one I desperately wanted another 30 minutes tacked on.

I think Korea has some of the best new films I've seen in years, compared to the dead drivel oozing from America and Hollywood these days. Admiral: Roaring Currents is a good example, as is Outlaws, and there are several epic drug or detective dramas and serial killer thrillers like \"I Saw the Devil\"--- absolute masterpieces, or at the least, excitingly different takes on modern thrillers. There are many others I can't remember by name, but you get the point. I enjoyed \"Outlaws\" the other night, which has a 7 rating, so when I saw that this film has over 8, I was thrilled. I had contemplated watching it for some time, and even got my wife to watch(she is not nearly as into foreign flicks, but enjoyed the Handmaiden and a few other horrors or thrillers from Asia.Anyway, this was intriguing, and had the potential to be very spooky and chilling. I just found that the direction they took with this made everyone seem humorous, disjointed, and inept idiots. The local cops are so unbelievably lazy and stupid that it ruins the realism. The pacing is bad, and way too slow or comedic for such heavy material in places. I was really hoping for a big twist, only to be let down by a \"it could be anyone, even you\" ending for finding the killer. There are many holes in logic in this movie, and I really need to read what the true story is based on-- because this surely cannot be the full true story. There are interesting moments, and the cinematography and music are quite haunting in places. The 8.3 or whatever score is a bit absurd, though. I can name at least 5 Korean films that are ranked lower than this one, but are extremely better in action, pacing, acting, script, and payoff.

The police are (once again) depicted as idiots more often than not. Interesting to see in how many Korean movies this is the case.The film starts off as a great mystery, then plummets to the eyebrow-scenes I mentioned above, and after the halfway mark it gets really interesting and suspenseful. I didn't find any actors incredibly good, but not entirely bad either - they just didn't seem all that serious considering the film's plot, and considering this was based on a true story. I thought the film had a lot of trivial scenes that could have been omitted, thereby cutting the lengthy running time. Based on the real-life unsolved murders, the film's ending does not provide any closure.It is nevertheless a good film, though, and if you're into Korean movies, I do recommend you see this.",

            "content": "Two rural detectives, their chief & a well-educated Seoul detective search for a serial killer who specifically chooses certain victims when it rains, using their own undergarments to bound and strangle them while he rapes their tied up bodies. We watch as the rural detectives, who often use rough tactics to secure their admittance of guilt from those they question, try to find the killer and how the effected the city detective is when attempts to catch him often fail. We see their dogged, weary pursuit of suspects and the exhaustive, emotional let-down when each is ruled out by one way or another. When a possible suspect emerges, and seems the ideal candidate fitting the profile of the rapist who nearly murdered one living victim(..and also requested a specific song only on the nights the murders took place, not to mention the fact that he started working at a factory right before the murders), they believe that their misery might finally end as they await a DNA semen report from America possibly pinpointing him as the murderer. But, is this suspect the murderer, and better yet, can the rural detectives keep from exploding in anger when they interrogate the suspect? It'll all come to a head when the city detective looses his suspect after falling asleep on his watch and yet another young woman is horribly butchered in a much more heinous manner during one of the town's common blackouts..the detective will take his suspect to an isolated location claiming him guilty even though the American lab results may say otherwise.Powerful, haunting, gut-wrenching, & heartbreaking..we see how these men fail at their methods despite giving their heart and souls to the case day after day. Developed obsessions with possibly suspects even have the detectives at each others' throats. The film is quite absorbing as we see how each detective loses a bit of their humanity as they cripple at the leads that fail them or at an eyewitness who perishes accidentally during a horrible train accident. The Korean leads all bring much to their roles..during the film each character is fleshed out and exposed of their flaws at trying desperately to catch a killer against many odds such as unavailable forensic techniques or civilians trampling over crime scenes. Beautifully crafted by director Joon-ho Bong who adds many humorous bits sprinkled throughout so that the achingly tragic story will not be such a burden to sit through. Bong respects the victims by not dwelling on the murdered bodies too long.",

            "content": "Bong Joon-Ho is a director that I knew a little about back in 2006 when I saw his wildly entertaining monster movie the Host. I had only seen that one film from him, but kept him in mind as someone good in the Korean film world (that is someone not Chanwook Park or Kim Ki-Duk). With this film, Memories of Murder, he's more than that now. As one goes through this tight murder mystery, based more on character and on the frustration of a clear pattern of a killer who makes it just a little too hard for the detectives to track down, you forget about the world around you or the time and just focus in on this story, of the grim line that delineates how to find a serial killer. Maybe it's because Joon-Ho knew that he was making a movie about the first ever serial killer in South Korea that he had to make it this way, about clash between inexperience and professionalism and right and wrong that's demonstrated here.It's not an action movie, but a character study, as non-conventional in its outcome or in its style as something like Fincher's films Se7en and Zodiac (for the former there's even so much as a specific shot and scene that is lovingly ripped-off, and the latter, well, just see the results of the case to know what I mean). It's the story of a series of rape/murders in a rural area of South Korea during a time of military dictatorship (watch out those 'citizen' alarms!), where women are being murdered and all in a pattern: wearing a red item of clothing, when it's raining, and when a specific and *sad* song is requested and played on the radio. While the local detectives Park Doo-Man and Cho Yong-koo try and shake down a confession out of a couple of suspects, one obviously mentally retarded, a seemingly hot-shot cop out of Seoul, Seo Tae-Yoon, comes in to help with the investigation and practically takes it over since he is, frankly, best at the job. This is not without some protest from the other detectives, of course, who feel threatened by their means of (nasty) interrogation to get a confession.One of the things that marks this as a departure from a lot of familiar serial killer mystery movies in America is the nature of the characters and how they relate to each other. Take the interrogation scenes early on: would you see in a typical movie an interrogation of a suspect where the suspect starts to go along with the detectives' premise just to get the hell out of the room? It's all about the details in the way the scenes are played out, how specifically and different Song and Kim play their roles, even as they're in the same profession and wanting the same end goal.Bong Joon-Ho also gives actors in small parts some fantastic scenes, such as the actor playing the mentally challenged man, or even the woman who somehow escaped the murderer's grasp but didn't see his face. And we get a real sense of these characters as having real conflicts and lives outside of this- sometimes with humor like Park's attempt to find a \"hairless man\" suspect at a sauna, or with some dark and violent ways like detective Cho who meets a nasty fate after a bar fight. Barely anyone is just two-dimensional, and even the main suspect-killer in the second half plays his blank-faced part perfectly.The characters all work, and the scenario is played out in a superior style (or if nothing else than with efficiency and a clear eye for details in the case arising naturally and without unnecessary melodrama), and on top of this the film looks gorgeous. Joon-Ho and his DP shoot and shoot away, getting some fantastic shots in these fields of the 'Boondocks' where the detectives find the bodies, or in the rain, or in a short burst in slow-motion that is just the right touch. A similar approach to artistry could be found in the Host, where an attention to light and dark and how to paint black and night scenes don't mare anything with the story itself. Particularly haunting is how he films the glimpses of the killer's-scenes-at-work, or in that masterful climax at the railroad tracks at the tunnel. By the end of the film, we don't know for sure if it's all entirely the truth and the whole truth (based on a true case), but it attains a hyper-reality that one can't shake off once it ends. It's a chilling tale that needs to be told, about the dire straits of breaking ground and not everything falling in to place.",

            "content": "There are only a handful of serial killer films that actually work, and with the Korean-based \"Memories of Murder,\" it's evident that director Joon-ho Bong has done his homework.Successful examples include \"Seven\" and \"Silence of the Lambs,\" a pair of films that expose their audience to grisly and suspenseful sights, but all the while creating vivid characters and memorable stories. Other films like \"Fallen\" and \"The Bone Collector\" do not. What makes \"Memories\" as unforgettable and dynamic as say \"M,\" is that the actors of this film are realistic, the story is believable, and the climax is original. You feel the apprehension of the characters, you struggle to understand the killer's motives, and you grimace at the way his victims are taken. Getting under your skin is what serial killer films are all about, and this is no exception.In South Korea in 1986, a naked woman is found bound and gagged in a drainage ditch in a field, and a pair of detectives and a special agent from Seoul has been assigned to find the murderer/rapist. Their efforts are numerous in trying to track down the killer, not taking anything for granted; they even attempt to find clues through the help of a fortune teller, and by even giving merit to the possibility that the killer may shave his pubic hair. Their crime scenes are routinely disturbed by locales, key pieces of evidence are run over by tractors, their forensic team is always a no-show, and their only help at solving the crime thus far is a handicapped boy, who may or may not be the killer. Yet with the boy in custody, and the murders continuing, a serial killer is indeed on the loose.The film has numerous touches of comedy that arguably helps the film numb down its depressing nature; many of these comedic touches involve one of the detective's constantly jump-kicking witnesses and suspects. The detective so habitually beats any and all suspects that he made a custom \"bootie,\" as to assure that his kicks won't leave any scratches. The way the film handles the humor is quite ingenious though, simultaneously showing the downfall and wrongs of police justice, the fallibility of investigative methods, and how a homicide system works without the prevalence of DNA tests. The musical score is terrific and adds tension to every scene, the camera work is top-notch and South Korea's fields and forests remain a visually scenic and eerily set landscape. The acting is genuine by everyone involved, especially from Kang-ho Song, the lead detective who sees the wrongs of the system but can only stand by and watch. The director does a fantastic job creating the mood, and like all atmospheric thrillers, the film is almost consistently covered with rain-shadow. His uncanny ability to create suspense when nothing is visibly threatening also earns the director much praise, and he makes the viewer see what the killer sees, with expert detail. As the murderer lurks behind trees, hides behind field stocks, and picks his prey, so do you and it works wonderfully. Based on the first recorded serial killer in Korean history, \"Memories of Murder\" is a film not easily forgotten. With memorable visuals, a haunting score, and quite hilariously brutal police work, the film adds realism to a very mature subject matter and succeeds brilliantly. The film was released in 2004 in limited release, and most video stores do not carry it. You can get it off Netflix or any online store that sells dvds.",

The two local detectives, quickly grab up a mentally challenged kid from the village. It was known that the lad liked the one victim.The two detectives administer some rather forceful third degree to the lad. They then get the lad to record a scripted confession. The case is solved and the two are local heroes.That is, till, a detective sent from Seoul arrives. This detective goes over everything and realizes the boy is not guilty. The boy is released and the local cops are less than amused with the new cop on the block.The new guy quickly shows his stuff though by going over the evidence and finding more victims. The local boys again grab up the first suspect for some country justice. Of course they are a bit too quick off the mark and this man is also innocent. The pace picks up steam as more women are added to the victim list. A woman cop helps out by pointing out all the murders happen on rainy nights, and when a certain song on the radio is played that same night.The net is thrown wider and a girl who survived an attack is located. Off her somewhat cloudy description, a new suspect is rounded up. This time the locals do not resort to the \"in your face\" interview tactics. They do not want anything that could foul up the court case. The man though does not break, and is set free. The police do however have people tail the suspect.There is a mix-up with the assignments and the tail is lost. Another dead girl is the result. On this victim there is a small bit of DNA evidence not ruined by the rain. This is sent off to the States for the FBI to examine.The evidence comes back as inconclusive. The Seoul detective knows they have the right man no matter what the evidence says. Now he goes off the dead end, he intends to kill the suspect. Does he? Not saying.",

I got the DVD of the movie instantly and saw it the very next day I saw \"Zodiac\" and the outcome? I have then decided that no other crime/detective movie can be as goo as this South Korean masterpiece. It is power packed Two and half hour movie with equal amounts of action and emotion.Set in the times of mid 80's, the period in which the military rule imposed strict rules on the civilians, a serial killer raped women and killed them. The movie follows the investigation sequences of the village policeman with the help of the police officer from Seoul. The story deepens as it goes ahead, revealing a whole lot of sub plots, each one telling the complexity of team work and human nature. The last scenes of the movie can set your tear glands to work.The last scene of the movie needs a special mention in which Inspector Park comes to the scene of crime after a long time and a girl approaches him and asks him what he is looking for. And she then tell that a man had been there at that place earlier before (suggestively the Murderer). Inspector Park asks the kid how he looked like and the girl replies, \"He looked Normal\" saying that she goes away and Inspector Park looks at the camera indicating that the killer might be one of the audience watching the movie. This scene by far is the best one I have ever seen on celluloid so far. Kudos to the director Bong Joon Ho for making a crime master piece.Note: Please do not watch this movie if you do not have respect towards cinema made in other languages and also towards other countries culture and also this movie is not for people who always want a villain in the end!. Saying that I conclude saying, one of the best two and a half hours you can ever spend your life is watching this movie!Cheers!",

The plot is constructed so that is spite of hard crimes and police violence, there are lots of dumb-and-dumber type giggling moments related to local policemen's comprehension and handling of events, intensified by a fresh look from the outsider - a cop from Seoul, the capital; all those characters are splendidly deliberated and performed. However, the events are not running smoothly and tensions are not always up high: the length could have been shorter and the ending was not up to my expectations either (true, the story is based on true events, but in films as such the viewers would expect the disclosure of a wrongdoer at least, if not more). Memories of Murder is a nice above-average film, but not among the best Korean films I have seen; as for that period, e.g. Shiri and Silmido are more interesting.",

A serial murderer preys on girls in a small city that seems to be dependent on a quarry.

They speculate, beat suspects and fail to solve the mystery by the end of the movie. The interpersonal dynamics among these men matter, but I won't write about that here. They are simply an excuse to twist a police procedural into a related set of cinematic essays about seeing and believing.Our primary watcher is the senior detective on the case. There are two others with radically different ways of reacting. We have girls, a psychic, the detective's girlfriend, a mentally challenged witness, film crews, lingering townspeople\u0085 We have the murderer of course, who we glimpse hiding in the scrub, watching.

The fact that this is all based on real life events draws us in deeper.Time and setting are important. It tells us that it takes place during a military dictatorship when Korea was still emerging as an industrial nation. Torture is used to try and goad suspects into confessions, and DNA evidence must be shipped to America for evaluation. Bong has a firm grasp at bringing a strong personality into his films. He's a skilled filmmaker, and a storyteller with bold ideas and the confidence that they'll work. The dynamic between his actors and the way he frames them offers heaps of visual information that hints at where the story may lead. I want to call this his best work. It's certainly a great film.

All the while it maintains a bone-dry, sardonic sense of humor in depicting the bumbling incompetence, unscientific methods, and aggressive tactics of small town detectives Park Doo-man and Cho Yong-koo. And even still, there's a wistful sorrow that pervades much of the feature, becoming ever more dominant as the narrative progresses.It's a very complex tone struck throughout the picture. To watch even just a couple of writer-director Bong Joon-ho's films, this should come as no great surprise. His skills are all but unparalleled; his mastery of the art form, intoxicating. Alongside fellow screenwriter Shim Sung-bo, Bong has crafted a movie that once again begins with a simple enough premise, but is by all means far more than what any basic synopsis could convey. This is a crime thriller, but it's a crime thriller more engrossing than any other in the genre I can readily name.The story begins with stark emphasis on the absolute chaos of a police force wholly unprepared to investigate the murders in their jurisdiction. When a well-educated detective arrives from Seoul to aid the inquiry, Seo Tae-yoon's professionalism clashes roughly with Park's forthright stubbornness and Cho's wild temperament. Even still, the body count rises, and so does the pressure on the team.The cast is phenomenal, including the ubiquitous Song Kang-ho as Detective Park and Kim Sang-kyung as Detective Seo. While only a supporting part, I'm also impressed by Go Seo-hee as Kwon Kwi-ok, a smart young officer in the department whose attention to detail leads to a turn in the investigation. Far be it from me to highlight just these few: Everyone involved inhabits their roles very completely, making them real and believable. And doing their part to add to the mounting air of desperation, frustration, and melancholySong's star power is no accident, though. His long list of credits speaks for itself, as does his rock-solid lead performance here. Yet the last scene of 'Memories of murder,' above all, speaks volumes to his skill. With the camera focused squarely on his face, Song displays such a withering mixture of strong emotion in his expression that what had been a down-note of a denouement suddenly becomes one of the most powerful moments of the film.And even before the momentous closing shot, Bong's captivating eye as a director is evident throughout the picture. The refinement of style between 'Memories' and 'Barking dogs never bite,' only 3 years before, is quite noteworthy. There's higher production value here generally, and with it the shots Bong captures are often both beautiful and haunting, whether he's showing us surrounding countryside, the expressions or interactions of characters, or fine detail within a scene.All this is to say nothing of composer Taro Iwashiro's excellent score, which from the moment the film begins is entrancing. Picking up with duly tense chords in suspenseful scenes, the music otherwise very much echoes the overall mournful atmosphere the feature projects, and it's mesmerizing. The use in this movie of Yu Jae-ha's song \"Sad letter\" is similarly notable.After watching even just one of Bong Joon-ho's films, let alone two or more, one quickly gains high expectations of his work, and he simply does not disappoint. As both writer and director Bong's skills are exceptional, and he unfailingly works with great casts, and composers and music supervisors, nevermind other crew. 'Memories of murder' was only his second full-length film, but it remains an essential, worthy thriller that easily matches his work since.",

            "content": "It is October 1986. Before we dive head first into the muted grey setting of the politically unrest and military sanctioned South Korea, we first discover a body in a field. A field so tinted that it gleams golden, and it seems to be the very last place you would discover the scene of a murder. But we don't start with the body. A television police procedural series might slowly zoom out from an extreme close-up of a mangled corpse, or as always, track two detectives as they arrive, one filling each other in on the details and thus keying in the audience. Here, we are immediately aware that this sort of crime is not commonplace, unlike an American setting that would be familiar with it. Members of the sorely lacking forensics crew are late, and incompetently present themselves as they fall over in the slippery embankment (from the rain, a common motif). An unbroken shot tracks our main character, Detective Park, as he struggles all over to keep reporters at bay, restore order and prevent key evidence from being destroyed by a unsuspecting tractor. He too is clearly out of his element. The film is now gray and depressing, and suddenly Park isn't as passionate and determined, but his flaws shine through. He and his impulsive partner Cho both subscribe to the mantra of 'flying jump kicks first, questions later', and when a female detective whose only role is seemingly to serve the males coffee attempts to chime in with a key insight, he laughs misogynistically and goes back to his ridiculous theory involving pubic hair (later, in a rare moment of humour, he investigates while at the sauna). He and Cho are determined to pin the murders on anyone, and here they differ from the more rational and analytical eye of the renegade from the big city, Seo. But the remarkable thing is that Bong Joon-ho veers away from the ridiculous, and plays these moments straight. The same frantic percussive score is used for both serial killer and the three detectives as they chase down a mysterious masturbator in the woods, and this signifies importance. The drums come to a climatic halt as Park spots a tiny vital clue in slow motion, and we are so sure that this is the killer. Only after days of unnecessarily cruel interrogation are we tipped off this is more a sign of desperation than anything with the murders happening.The same thing occurs with the mentally handicapped Kwang-ho who seems a perfect scapegoat. He launches into a monologue that seems strangely knowledgeable for one so innocent, and everyone is entranced, but again the trail hits a dead end with a dose of common sense. A spade is introduced, and we think a confession is about to be brutally beaten out of him, but we cut and it is even worse; he is digging his own grave. Seo lies in the background, blurry in the shallow focus, clearly disapproving of these methods. Later, as Park and Cho bumbled around with superstitious nonsense, he stumbles upon the same setting, trying to gleam some insight, but the chase if of course fruitless for both parties. Bong Joon-ho makes the entire case frightening. Torrential rain is the recurring weather condition, and a haunting song that cues in another murder. Here we first become obsessed with the case as Seo does. We view girls in red from within the trees, obscured from view, and the ominous POV of the serial killer stalks the wet dirt path, but we have first seen this shot from Seo as they run the operation hoping to bait the killer. The only terrifying glimpse of the killer occurs right before a stunning reveal of the huge factory, smoking and groaning in the rain as a victim swivels around. The drums build up frantically and suddenly, the camera is shaky and then a split second of terror, before we cut to black - an extremely well done and fear inducing scene. Later they visit the prime suspect at yep, the factory, and although Seo does not know it, Bong Joon-ho has subtly linked the two scene together, and hope that we make the same link. Earlier, Seo as the sensible detective believes steadfastly in hard evidence, as it cannot lie, but after stalking and obsessing, he now cannot come to terms with the hard truth of the DNA results. In a reversal, Park is the one who has to wrestle the gun away from him.But altogether, it is Park we start and end with. The golden idyllic fields are visited again, but here he is no longer a hotshot cop, who believes he can figure out who is guilty just by looking into their eyes with his shaman instincts. He visits that grate again, perhaps for the nostalgic value of it all, perhaps all these years still yearning for the one that got away. He mirrors his earlier action, peeking down again, but this time the camera does not produce instant gratification - it zooms out slowly, agonisingly, as if it were about the unveil a stunning plot twist or an revolutionary moment of realisation. Maybe that is what Park is looking for down there. A normal looking guy has also committed the same nostalgic action recently; there is absolutely nothing to go on in this girl's testimony (a sentiment comparable to Fargo, or Zodiac). So close and yet so far out of reach, he stares us deep right in the eyes - a futile plea, an accusatory glance. The statute of limitations for the real life case that this film is based on has long run out, but there is no doubt that it still haunts and lingers in the minds of those involved.",

            "content": "I'm going to be honest here, I don't know a single Korean film released before 2000 other than JSA. Basically the internet doesn't tell me anything about old famous Korean films at all. Japan had famous old films like Kurosawa, Ozu, Mizoguchi films, China has A Touch of Zen, Bruce Lee films, and Springtime in a Small Town, and Korea has basically nothing on the internet of any famous Korean films before 1990s. I am sure that i'm not the only who is curious to dive into older Korean films of the 50s and 60s but literally the internet tells us nothing! This is quite upsetting since even Criterion only released one Korean film and that was Secret Sunshine. (2008 dammit!) Every film fan should at least try a taste of each country and tell themselves if they liked it or not. Basically every country other than African countries have a past with cinema except for Korea and African Countries basically. Enough with the hate already, I'm here to discuss about the golden age of Korean cinema when it first respawned and when it first became well known onto the internet with their greatest year, 2003.2003 is a wonderful year for Korean cinema with their 2 films that are often considered the greatest Korean films, Oldboy and Memories of Murder. Oldboy was beautiful and memorable but at the same time disturbing and uncomfortable to even watch. Memories of Murder was based off on a bunch of murders in a small local town but it includes a dark comedic twist.With Kang-Ho Song, Kim Sang-Kyung, and Kim Roi-Ha, Memories of Murder is by far one of the greatest films to exist of all time. It's acting is top notch, cinematography is silent and moves fast when it needs to, the music is haunting, and the director himself couldn't have done better. This movie is like when you throw a dart and it lands exactly into that small hole that earns you the most amount of points, it's rewarding and it's rare.There is really nothing else to say about this story other than spoiling it but you must watch it as soon as possible when you have the time and you won't regret it.",

What shocked me most about this one is the ending, unlike anything u could expect from a Hollywood blockbuster. True, Se7en had an unexpected, bitter-sweet, emotional ending, not a happy one for sure, but this one is impossible for Hollywood, because here it all ends so true to life and reality, almost leaves u hanging there. The film is not only a brilliant crime drama, it also is a study of the changing South Corea and how rural life looked there 20 years ago. It also makes fun at the Asian kick-culture of violence and trying to solve problems this way, embodied by the detectives' third side-kick (oh the pun:)) and his fate. It also shows a piece of rural life that contains misery, loneliness, deviations. All washed in a sepia, gray-brownish colors of the Corean countryside.

Death Row is filled with people convicted using these methods.Kang-ho Song (The Host, Secret Sunshine) is excellent as the cop who is just interested in closing a serial-killer case as fast as possible using these methods. Fortunately, a detective (Sang-kyung Kim) comes from the big city and sits quietly examining evidence and doing research to put the police on the right track.It is really funny watching the local cops staking out bathhouses looking for hairless men and consulting Shamans, while the real police work is being done sifting through garbage.

With \"Memories of Murder\", we receive his classic 2003 serial murder mystery, which in spite of being only his second feature, is a strong rival for his best work. Though compared favourably to David Fincher's excellent \"Zodiac\", this cracker Korean film came four years prior.Based on real life events that gripped South Korea back in the late eighties, this riveting thriller delivers Bong's clever filmmaking touches, mixing pull no punches drama with deft comedic bits to create a rich viewing experience. Whether the small village cops slapsticking and bungling a gruesome crime scene, or brutally extorting confessions from the innocent, they do so in a flowing, organic rhythm of tone shifts that is key to the movie going experience.Parasite star Song Kang-ho is excellent as the rowdy, cocksure detective who claims to reveal criminals by looking deep into their eyes. He is the perfect blend of boisterous, naive, silly, gung ho and empathetic. As with most Bong projects, such sublime character development is crucial to the plot.The less said about the storyline the better (and the real story has some interesting recent revelations). Best left to discover that on your own. \"Memories of Murder\" defies the \"early effort\" tagline. It is a fully developed, beautifully shot, perfectly paced, and gripping film, from start to finish. A shadowy thinker, it ranks right up there with \"Parasite\", tackling political, personal and societal themes in the guise of a simple story, in what is now a considerable Bong cannon, and is a much welcome discovery.hipCRANK",

The acting is quite good ans especially authentic, the story of the murderer is gripping, the conditions at the time when the movie takes place are different, unusual and mostly based on intuition and courageous ideas so that this movie is easily distinguishable from other ones of the same kind. This is a psycho thriller that takes a look a the souls and feelings of its different characters and doesn't need any technical forensic analysis as it is a quite mature old school movie. This charm is underlined by some very brutal scenes and a lot of dark humour. One could easily describe this movie as an Asian film noir. You also learn a lot about Korea and about Asian culture in this unique movie as this is mostly based on true events. The ending of the movie might surely not please to some people but it is once again unusual and different from the mostly boring Hollywood stuff nowadays.The movie is highly entertaining as new possibilities and surprises arise throughout the whole story and create a complex and mysterious story. Maybe the characters are doing some mistakes in the movie (they don't realize that they have an important eyewitness until the end of the movie, they don't follow the hints of that disturbed witness and they are way too brutal with the different suspects) but this imperfect behaviour is somewhat the charm of those characters and the movie. The only reason why I didn't give the highest rating is that the movie was not always as suspenseful as I expected. This movie has a slow development and prefers to show us the conditions and the personalities of the movie rather than the fear of the victims and the pitiless brutality of the murderer and I think that a little mixture of both could have helped to not only create a very good movie but a true gripping masterpiece. Nevertheless, this is only a small detail and the movie is truly entertaining and original and wants to be authentic rather than being weird or shocking.",

Perhaps, a Crime Thriller of this stature with such sensitive subject matter in hand didn't necessitate additional humor.On the story front, as it is composed in a competent style; The tension remained resolute throughout the duration! Even though sporadically, the Screenplay does become slightly languid. Apparently improvising as it draws nearer its conclusive finale!One wouldn't cast doubt over the technical masteries of a Joon-ho production. Just as envisaged, the Cinematography quite stunningly assimilates inner essence of a countryside habitat. With preferentially wider shots & gloomy undertones, doesn't it look so gorgeous? The Score builds the very foundation of such an atmosphere by getting on to melancholic routes with periodic exuberance.In terms of Performances, the entire ensemble did outstanding work. Moreover, a grounded approach made it all the more so pragmatic & rational!Considering his accomplished filmography thus far; It may not be the finest attempt coming from Bong Joon-ho.

            "content": "Based on an actual series of murders in South Korea between the years 1986 and 1991, Bong Joon-ho's Memories of Murder is a well performed, thought-provoking film about the investigation into Korea's first serial killings. The film, which combines bleak reality with dark comedy, is less about the actual crimes than about the emotional toll it took on the police officers investigating the case.The film opens in 1986 when South Korea was still under the control of a repressive military dictatorship. A woman's body is found in Gyunggi province in a drainage pipe in a rural area outside of Seoul, raped and strangled by her own stockings. The crime scene is chaotic. Reporters and spectators mill about and a tractor rides over the area destroying footprints and other potential evidence. Local police officers Park Doo-man (Song Kang-ho) and his aggressive partner, Cho Yong-ku (Kim Roe-ha) are in charge of the investigation but are joined later by a volunteer from Seoul, detective Seo Tae-yoon (Kim Sang-kyung).The police, however, are preoccupied with protest demonstrations against the government, and do not put the necessary manpower and resources into a proper investigation. A rivalry soon develops between the intuitive Park and the cerebral Seo. Park claims that he can detect a killer by simply looking into a suspect's eyes. Seo is more rational and scientific but both overlook crucial evidence and both do not hesitate to brutalize suspects. Although they force confessions from Baek Kwang-ho (Park No-shik), a retarded man, and a man who masturbates at the crime scene, they know that the confessions will not stand up in court. Showing signs of desperation, they torture an eyewitness to the murders to the point where he tries to escape and is run over by a passing train.Eventually the detectives locate a suspect who admits that he requested a song heard on the radio each night a murder has been committed, but not a shred of evidence is ever found. After they beat him, he tells the police, \"People know you torture innocent people.... You'll never victimize me.\" Memories of Murder presents a powerfully haunting picture of a society so inured to violence and repression that a serial killer is a minor annoyance. As more strangled women are found, a sense of sadness and frustration begins to settle on the investigation and it becomes obvious that the police force is not prepared either by education or methodology to achieve results until the society it operates in can be purged of its authoritarian past.",

I had already seen two Bong Joon-ho movies (\"The Host\" and \"Barking Dogs Never Bite\") so in my readings, I had learned that his masterpiece is actually this \"Memories of Murder.\" \"Memories...\" is about a small very rural town which was terrorized by a serial killer who victimized young women on rainy days in the 1980s South Korea.The local police detective of that town (played by Song Kang-ho, whom I saw before in \"The Host\" and \"The Show Must Go On\") employed very backward simplistic reasoning in his investigation and violent interrogation techniques on his hapless suspects. The case also attracts a detective from Seoul (played by Kim Sang-kyung) who offers his help in the investigation.But since their logic and approach are polar opposites, the two detectives are constantly at odds with each other. The local detective would especially want to one-up his big city counterpart. This conflict became the source of hilarious black comedy, as well as very effectively tense dramatic moments. I felt this flawed cooperation between these two characters is the heart of the movie, while the serial killer mystery was merely a backdrop.My description here of the film is very broad. There are many gems of character development scattered throughout the film that are very noteworthy as well. The director very frankly captured the atmosphere of the time, with those creepy scenes while the women were stalked, the feeling of sheer helplessness by the police as a whole, as well as how the case affected each cop personally. The ending is quite abrupt and unexpected, but I read afterward that that was how it actually happened in real life (yes, this movie was inspired by a real case!).This is a highly recommended movie in my opinion. Warning on some gory scenes of corpses for those who are queasy. I definitely would like to watch more Korean movies after this one.",

However, I was blown away by the fact that I never found this film earlier and while Song is excellent in it, the film and nearly everything about it is flawless in execution. The story about a detective in a small countryside town who finds a serial killer yet it's the incompetencies of the police force in general and human error which leads more and more murders. As the murders continue they find themselves powerless to use whatever clues they have to find the murderer. I'll leave it at that in terms of plot as it the film beautifully pulls you in until it's frustratingly simple conclusion. The cinematography is outstanding with a haunting score worthy of the film's amazing direction. I simply cannot find the words to describe how great this film is. I rarely watch films twice and never watched a film again without getting bored. On repeated viewings, you begin to appreciate the little scenes the director has put in and i didn't pick up one of the running gags until the third time though, they add little to the plot but are enjoyable and fascinating as the director chooses to move at his own pace. While not perfect, the quality of the film brings the smallest niggles to light and while there are only a few, this film does not get the recognition it deserves in the west, yet at the same time, it's like a little secret that is appreciated by those who are lucky enough to find it. As with any murder and mystery, you'll be looking for clues, even on multiple viewings but at best you'll be grasping at straws and jumping to conclusions until the frustratingly simple ending",

The first half-hour to hour is blackly comic, slightly farcical (forensic evidence destroyed by incompetence), but, for me, the film's greatness is when its tone changes - and the borders between the two leading detectives, Park, &, Suh, become blurred until Suh breaks down. The downbeat ending lingers in the mind, and its realistic portrayal of a desperate police investigation is head and shoulders above most Hollywood sensational crime pics.",

His victims, all females, are all brutally attacked, and one of the main emphasis of the movie plays strongly on the detectives condition and the impact that this is all having on them, as the strain and stress of not being able to crack the case weighs down on them.The murder hunt is very intriguing, but this is not your usual Saturday night detective program. If anything, this film is original with stunning camera work and scenery complemented by some great acting by all the characters.

            "content": "The first fifteen minutes or so seem kind of slapdash, with over-emphatic acting, undistinguished photography, and exposition that seems to be going nowhere. But if you make it over that bar, you'll find a police procedural with a good deal of personality and a more subtle story than you might have expected.It could easily have been a typical Hollywood serial murder movie. Maybe it still will be. It will star Brad Depp and Julia Theron and will sport a ten-billion dollar budget. Here, in its original form, we have a small-scale story of an unsolved case of serial murders in a small Korean town.Detective Park, a beefy guy with a big chin who is not too bright, investigates a murder. His partner is Detective Cho, even less bright and more impulsive. Soon another corpse turns up and Detective Seo arrives from Seoul, the big city. While the two rural cops are beating the bushes (and some suspects) looking for a solution, Seo intuits that a third murder has been committed, and he's right. The girls were all young, beautiful, wearing red clothes on a rainy night, and the killings were preceded by requests for a rare pop song at a radio station. I know. It all sounds a little familiar and maybe Dennis Hopper should turn up as the crazed murderer.There are quite a few comic scenes in the first half of the film as the cops bang their heads against the wall and follow false leads. They all go out to dinner with the dour Chief of Police. The intense Chief unexpectedly gets so drunk his head falls on the dinner table, but he wakes up when two of the others begin scuffling with one another. Then he vomits and brightens, claiming he's had an inspiration regarding the case. The drunken Detective Cho explains the difference between the Korean police and the American FBI in terms of geography. The FBI has to use brains because the country is so big that they must sit in one place and figure things out, whereas South Korea is the size of Cho's member and can be covered by detectives on foot in no time. Cho doesn't use the word \"member\". There's at least as much obscenity in this film as there will be in the Hollywood remake.By this time, I suspect, you'll be grabbed by the story and it gets more serious. And, I have to say, it's curious to see the law exercised in the Republic of Korea. A public announcement tells us that the president is about to make a visit and we expect bands, speeches, and cheers. What we see instead is a tank growling through the crowded streets and protesters throwing firecrackers and stones at it. The cops beat hell out of whomever they want. If a suspect is confessing on tape to a crime he knows nothing about, the cops don't mind giving him hints. \"Yes -- I strangled her! I strangled her with -- with -- (a cop cups a pair of imaginary breasts) -- with her BRASSIERE!\" They hang an obviously psychotic suspect by his heels and hold him for four days without charging him. On the other hand, only once does a gun appear in a cop's hand, and then in a context that defines it clearly as disapproved of.Things, unanticipated things, happen the way they do in real life. Detective Cho is taken off the case for police brutality, gets drunk, starts a brawl over some bul-kogi, and a bystander interferes by whacking him in the calf with a wooden board, but the board happens to have a rusty nail in it, and Cho winds up with tetanus. Seo, the big-city cop, falls asleep on a stakeout, an important suspect slips away, and another murder takes place.By the end of the movie, the corpses that have provided the occasions for smiles, have become the dead bodies of girls we've gotten to know a little about and it's no longer an occasion for amusement. A suspect is finally identified who looks like the real thing. A young man who operates a computer, handsome almost to the point of femininity, but the FBI's DNA analysis yields ambiguous results. I don't think I'll spoil the ending that, in its own quiet way, is memorable.Well worth seeing.",

Said murders took place in a town of Hwaseong, Gyeonggi Province and attracted attention from the capital as well as from international sources. The movie naturally takes some liberties with the events in order to keep the story flowing, as it should, but it still means that it's a thriller with real weight behind it.The movie has garnered a lot of praise for its acting. Song Kang-ho playing the role of Park Doo-man, the local detective in charge of the investigations, won numerous awards for his performance, while I personally also really liked the performance by Kim Sang-kyung, playing the role of an investigator sent from Seoul to lend his expertise to the local police, who have never dealt with a case of such magnitude.The cinematography, directing and camera work have also gathered wide praise, and for a reason. The colours are vibrant and lush, the score it utilized with care, the camera angles are inventive and it's just a very nice film to follow visually.What keeps me from enjoying this film more is the fact that it's so stereotypically Korean. And don't get me wrong, I like Korean films and Korean style of filmmaking. But every other Korean film I've seen has been completely over the top and outlandish, with crazy stunts, characters and story lines. Normally that's the strength in those films, but imagine if that kind of style was utilized in a thriller based on a real life serial killer case. The movie lost me the first time a cop jump kicked a criminal. Granted, it's the most grounded Korean film I've ever seen, but I still felt detached from the story because I couldn't take it seriously.But, I can easily see how some might consider that an upside. So, let us simply say that while Memories of Murder might not be for every single thriller fan, it's still more than proficient enough for everyone to at least own it a chance.",

            "content": "basically, Memories of Murder is a haunting masterpiece of crime thriller. For Americans, it would be interpreted as the Korean version of Zodiac, despite the fact that it's released 4 years earlier than Zodiac.The movie is not the nearly half-documentary narration adopted by Zodiac. It's more alike a serious drama but had the touch of reality. And, reality is the topic it tried to deal with. Using this style, the director was able to pull off some fantastic moments that might have already earned the reputation of classics. For instance, every scene with the retarded boy was ingenious, sadistic and sad to watch. The relationship between the victim and the public, the police who tried to solve it, and the suspect had been clearly illustrated by the camera. Their underlying psychologies shined, as the public and the victim just wanted to grab a piece of meat to blame, and the police had the obligation to satisfy such a desire. But for the suspects, they were really caught up in the middle of this misery. That's why each of them was nearly beaten to death. The slow-mo long shot of the retarded boy trying to escape the police and the medias was already a classic.Like Zodiac, Memories of Murder is an exploration of societal changing. Or more precisely, societal tragedy. The murder cases themselves are societal tragedies already. But, the director told the story in the perspective of cops, therefore each time those uneducated countryside cops missed some important threads, the audience will sigh for them. Since all the cases took place in the countryside, it's not emphasized much by the metropolitan polices for Seoul. Therefore, the cops assigned to solve the case were also countryside cops with limited knowledge and technologies. At last, they never caught the killer because their incompetence...... This is a remind that, crimes had been evolving much faster than detectives, and to solve a murder case is far more difficult than to commit it. Such situation could happen anywhere because by trying to solve a mystery, one can become another sub-problem of the mystery.I was mocking the cops about their incompetence, that they never continued to follow those valuable threads and evidences. Once they catch a new suspect, they fell into some kind of self-filling logic, \"Since I caught him, he's the murderer.\" Later, the retarded boy proved to be more valuable witness than they knew, but their ignorance of psychology and mental patient did them no good...... But when the movie ends, I reflected on it, and decided to write this commentary in a fair way.8/10 haunting and deep story, but could be too disturbing for ladies and children. Recommended to 20+.",

            "content": "(Minor spoilers below) The first thing I noticed in Bong Joon- ho's newest film is the blocking and cinematography. Every dialogue scene is essentially blocked and shot perfectly, cutting only when necessary and keeping all of the relevant information clear in every shot. Beyond that, however, lies characters that are all far from perfect, but always believable and absorbing.Memories of Murder is essentially a crime thriller/drama with comedic elements and a bit of social commentary. But do not go into this expecting it to be a comedy thriller, because as the characters get more and more serious about the case, so does the film. In fact, the comedic elements essentially stop after the first hour or so.The first time the two main characters meet, there is immediately a conflict between them. Basically the conflict between them is each of their methods for finding the killer; one of them tries to brute force a confession from a possible suspect and will investigate simply based on word of mouth, while the other sticks to the documents and the facts. This killer basically starts out as means for competition between the two of them, each one trying to find the killer through their own methods. But as they become more and more absorbed with the case, they don't necessarily become friends, but both of them start working towards a common goal, both of them using each other's methods.But this film is more than just a 2 way character study. It is also a commentary on what cops are allowed to get away with because of their power. 2 of the cops in this film are incredibly violent and short tempered, and not very smart. The characters pretty much get away with torturing innocent people (and almost killing one), trying to put an innocent man in jail, and inciting one extremely violent bar fight. While it may not be as bad as the criminal they are chasing, those are things most people would go to prison for if they were not cops. We put a lot of our trust in the police, but what we don't realize is that sometimes the people they give the power to, may not be the ones that deserve it.But hands down, the greatest part of this film is the overwhelming amount of tension it builds. This movie starts chugging along after the first murder (which occurs in the first few minutes) and gains momentum for the rest of the film, building to one of the most intense climaxes I have ever seen. As the characters become obsessed with the case, so do you. Every suspect is thoroughly examined not only by the characters, but by the viewer. Every possibility, every clue, building to one of the most immersive and captivating films I have ever seen.I will not spoil the end in this review, but I will say it was basically the perfect way to cap this film off.",

The film follows the story of 2 detectives- one local and another from Seoul- trying to solve a serial murder case in 1986 South Korea and is based on real events.This is Bong Joon-ho's 2nd film as a director and it already feels like a masterpiece (there are some minor flaws). This film is one of modern cinema's best crime-thrillers around and I hope now after Bong's huge breakthrough this film gets the recognition it deserves.",

            "review_title": "A Nutshell Review: (DVD) Memories of Murder",
            "content": "I've always taken a liking for serial-killer crime thrillers such as Se7en or the more recent Zodiac, because the cat-and-mouse game between the killer and the cops never seem to tire out, at least for me, and especially so if they're based on real life incidents which add a sense of realism in the stories that are told. It can be wavered off as implausible, because there were real victims who fell under the cunning of the killer.Korean crime thrillers have so far been a mixed bag though, even if those like Voice of a Murderer were based on unsolved true incidents, because in the hands of less able directors, it's always easy to lapse into laziness in making the film, applying quite standard narrative types involving chronology, and what happens next, or over dramatizing elements of the story just to amplify emotions of pity and anger, or worse yet, become a bland whack-fest, hyping on gruesomeness and gore as spectacle. And here's where director Bong Joon-ho, who went on to make the superb The Host, excelled, in sailing with an even keel in the presentation of Memories of Murder, making it extremely memorable, and went beyond your standard crime thriller fare by deftly gelling together all elements in the movie, into one keenly felt film.Memories of Murder recounts possibly South Korea's first serial killer, who went on a spree between 1986 and 1991 with 10 women brutally raped and murdered, and sparked off an intense investigations which involved some 1.8 million cops and 3000 suspects, as the prologue would have us believe. Song Kang-ho stars as Detective Park Doo-man, a small town cop with little experience in investigations of such nature, and it's slowly revealed too that the police of those days possess very rudimentary skills and equipment to handle crime of such nature, coupled with the complexity of having to deal with curious villagers and onlookers who contaminate each crime scene.In comes Detective Seo Tae-yoon (Kim Sang-kyung) from Seoul who volunteered for this assignment, and you have your big city versus small town rivalry, as the two of them can't see eye to eye in various matters, especially when it boiled down to extracting confessions of convenience from prime suspects, in order to wrap up the case and call it a day, dished out from in your face beatings by Park's sidekick Kim Roe-ha (Cho Yong Koo). Under a social and historical backdrop of martial law, we see how questionable methods get employed, and how sloppy investigations can get, at times relying on questionable and unorthodox methods involving torture.It is this constant interplay of opposites that keep the viewing engaged throughout, especially with the incessant challenging of individual cop's beliefs and investigative philosophies, which at times can dwell on black humour, such as the profiling of hairless men. All the lead cops in the movie no doubt will grow and come out of this experience changed, such as how small time cop gets forced to open his mind and widen his horizon, and how the constant frustration at being hit with red herring after red herring, of being so close but yet so bloody far, just adds on to the complexity of the case that this is not your simple criminal, but a cold and calculated serial one.There are a couple of elements that I particularly enjoyed in the film, such as how opposites almost always bring about a clash, be it of values or methods employed, in particular how Detectives Park and Seo come to blows, one a believer of his own sixth sense ability, while the other a follower of paper and documentation. Director Bong also crafted an element of comparison between the macho cops and a rather soft prime suspect, one you would probably not have put on your radar, who just appears, and I couldn't help but to draw comparisons with David Fincher's famous Se7en and Zodiac, which were made before and after this one, where it is fairly clear of certain similarities between this film and Se7en with its incessant rainy setup, while Zodiac shares the same frustration with this one in the cops' inability and impotence of not being able to crack the case in front of them, resulting in an increase in body count. Nothing beats having to know the MO, but being powerless to do something about it.Best of all, Bong Joon-ho knows how to craft a thriller with action at the right moments, and they need no be big-bang types, but sequences which were highly effective in bringing out adrenaline. He did that for this film, and for The Host, and without a doubt I begin to feel that he understands the material at hand in order to craft them for the pleasure of an audience sitting through it. I still have one more of his earlier movies on DVD format yet to be watched, and I hope to pop that into the player once I savor this masterpiece once more. Highly recommended, and it sits in my mental list of great serial killer crime films.",

            "review_title": "Store This One In Your Memory Banks",
            "content": "Memories Of Murder, is a highly entertaining well grafted and nigh on perfectly designed piece of cinema about the real life killings of local village girls during the 1980s in South Korea. Memories sets out to make a serious film and not trivialise these events, which it does in a very simple manner coupled with exceptional cinematography and highly idiosyncratic characters whose introductions never over shadow the films events.Memories Of Murder has its own agenda on commentating on these events, making it quite clear that the social situation created in Korea at the time meant the government was \"too busy suppressing its own citizens to put resources into a proper investigation\". And it is that which is the overriding theme throughout. There is a sense when you watch this film that the operation was completely botched. Not only did the police forces lack the necessary forces to cope with such a killer, but also that the police were more concerned with finding a 'scapegoat', as is seen in the interrogation sequences. They adopted a 'any face will do' motif, and they lost not only valuable time, but face with the public.Memories is marked by a trio of outstanding performances by Song Kang Ho, Kim Sang Kyung and Park Hae-Il who each bring something unique to this creation. Their rivalry and own internal issues mean they clash with each other and must look deep within themselves for answers while yet never distracting from the film. Kang-Ho Song provides the most intriguing of all the three detectives. At the start of the film we see he has no actual intent in catching the killer and a forced confession is enough for him to sleep easy at night, as long as he thinks he's right. However he has a gift for being able to deduce whether people are telling the truth or not by looking into their eyes. The legitimacy of this 'gift' however is questioned throughout the course of the films duration, even by his own family, which is well done in keeping the audience hooked as we want to believe in him but don't know if we should. Detective Seo Tae-Yoon (played by Sang-kyung Kim) is the enforcer of the trio, a high flying, heavy boot wearing, hot headed time bomb. His deep seated anger issues and a a somewhat noticeable lack of refined sensibilities in policing enquiries hamper a man who in the end wishes to do good and we can still sympathise if not empathise. Roe-ha Kim as Detective Cho Yong-koo is the most gripping of the three as his transformation throughout the film as he delves deeper into the depraved mind of a sadistic serial killer, begins to haunt him more than it does the other two. Having been sent in from Soeul he is charged with responsibility of finding this man and the toll it takes on him as a human being is remarkable. There are obviously more issues to discuss about how good this film is but the acting speaks for itself and is truly the driving force of this film, and 'will' keep you watching.Memories is a wonderful film, which is by no means perfect, but its fusion of serial killer thriller will drama and black humour gives this all too familiar genre a refreshing new twist, if Zodiac were any good this is the type of film it would be like, and is more often than not provocative. It's nail biting tension provides the audience with moral qualms throughout, questions over our honour, our integrity and our principles. The notion of What Is Justice? rings out loud and inevitably there are only answers to be found within yourself. While some may find the ending forced, I found it pleasant within the context of the film as it served its purpose to highlight the damage done to our three protagonists. Memories is a must watch film if you are a fan of Korean cinema or the genre, but more importantly, this is a really good film that anyone interested in film (from anywhere) should view and enjoy. This is one you 'will' remember.",

In \"Seven\", you had a gripping story, gory killings and a few \"holy sh..\" plot twists. This movie is a linear narrative about couple of stupid clueless cops running around in circles, randomly busting and torturing vulnerable people without any reason. Most of the traces go nowhere, most of the \"Chekhov's guns\" never fire.I didn't like \"Zodiac\", and I didn't like this movie.

'Salinui chueok' or 'Memories of Murder' was a natural choice for me to watch as I enjoy crime dramas and, from my experience at least, the standard of Korean films in this genre is very high.This is a well made, deep and engaging drama film with some very funny moments, which I certainly wasn't expecting. As with any decent murder mystery, it has plenty of unpredictable twists and turns and keeps you guessing throughout. The storyline is realistic and the strong acting and well-developed characters only add to the realism. It is another impressive piece of Korean cinema.My only gripe, and unfortunately it is a big one, is the film's ending. I'm not a fan of 'open' endings in general - after spending over two hours watching something, I want closure. But for a crime film like this involving a murder investigation to offer no explanation is especially frustrating.

That it's been so highly praised internationally is the kind of \"affirmative action\" pandering that occasionally strikes film festivals; it's success at home just confirms Koreans flock to bad movies too.The major responsibility of a director is to present a movie that is of a piece, that is, it is unified as a story in tone, time and place, and offers a believable and interesting plot. This movie is all over the place tonally: it has moments of madcap wannabe Jackie Chan-style buffoonery with Three Stooges-level relationships among the leads, offers serious policier pretensions for most its second half. As for running time: the whole thing is incredibly long, all the more so for a film that offers no real suspense, no threat to its protagonists and clues that come out of nowhere, like the female officer's sudden, out-of-the-blue discovery that a certain song is played whenever the murderer strikes. (And we're asked to believe that these cops are dimwitted enough to think that the murderer himself may have requested the song with a postcard that gives his accurate name and address!)It doesn't matter that the movie is built on a true case. So what? You don't go and make a movie about an unsolved crime unless it offers some other insight other than the banal idea that the serial killer-rapist could be anyone (which of course isn't true; we're not all killers). After slogging through an interminable running time, to then be offered no resolution (even after a meaningless flash-forward to ten or so years later) is an anticlimax of the worst kind. An absolute piece of total pretension with bungling characters and lousy story-telling (e.g., the retarded suspect obviously has been an eyewitness to a killing but the cops realize this two hours after you will), this movie may sour you for other, good Korean films. Don't let that happen.",

Special effects and big names is the main reason Hollywood still rules. However, for sheer originality and creativity, look away from Los Angeles towards Seoul.This grisly, dark, eccentric film shows why. \"Salinui chueok\" is a quirky, moody film that starts off not quite serious, almost comic. Well, not surprising, since the two naive, rural cops don't deal with much crime in the countryside in a militia-ruled Korea (set in the mid- 1980s). They find themselves in a case they can't handle: they have to deal with a serial murder that gathers press coverage and scrutiny. As the murders grow, detective Park has to compete with the smarter detective Seo from the big city (Seoul) and he learns solving crimes isn't just about intimidating suspects. The city and rural cops have to cooperate increasingly to try to capture the murderer. But the teaser, as all unsolved murders remains. The witnesses are unable to help, confessions are worthless, and the killer runs free. The film evolves into a serious masterpiece as Park matures throughout the movie from using police brutality to dealing with the press and proper evidence. As the end the film shows a more mature Park with a family maybe moving on...but not quite, he is still haunted by memories of a murder.Acting and cinematography are outstanding. It's a nice cultural peek into a rural Korea with unadorned eateries, schools with outhouses and broken-down police cars. The quirky fascinating characters (the half-crazy detective Cho or the simpleton Kwang-ho) add to the fun.",

This film starts with a murder of a girl. The police comes to investigate the case. In the beginning the police just wants to frame a ill witted guy, by making him confess that he had committed the crime. The police is not much bothered about it. I never knew about the enactment of the crime that the culprit has to do in some countries. It was really funny to see that the mentally disabled guy was doing the enactment, while his father comes and say that why he is doing this when he knew that he didn't kill that girl.One more main character is the detective Seo Tae-Yoon, who is mistaken as a rapist by Park Doo-Man and beats him. Detective Seo Tae-Yoon doesn't quite understand the working culture of the local police. In the beginning, there is a slight tiff between the two main characters- Park Doo-Man and Seo Tae-Yoon . But, as time passes they do get along.This movie is funny. But, the Park Doo-Man along with Seo Tae-Yoon finds out some patterns in the murder, but all ends up in futility.

'Memories of Murder' is no exception, a gripping mix of detection, character study and black humour. Based on a true story it involves the incompetent and under-resourced investigation of a serial murder spree in a rural Korean village. The script and acting are very good, the two mismatched Inspectors are both changed by their ordeal and the differences between them become blurred towards the end. No doubt the inevitable Hollywood remake is not too far away, what a depressing thought.",

Unless it's done in a funny way or it's a legitimate, useful device for storytelling, I see no reason to expose one's self to revolting images. For a film about multiple murders, \"Memories\" has minimal gore (around 5 brief scenes in a 2-hour film). Bong managed to create a really absorbing character-driven portrayal of a murder investigation, focusing on the investigators rather than the culprit. Nor does it even attempt to analyze the culprit's motives, an annoying pitfall which most similar films can't resist (but which \"Silence of Lambs\" does so well). It's a pretty straightforward ride along with Detective Park and his fellow small town underdogs, anti-heroes who sometimes employ questionable tactics out of sheer desperation or just because they don't know any better. Even Detective Seo, the big shot from Seoul, isn't the suave city guy, a prototype Bong relishes in squashing right upon Seo's introduction. Thrillers usually are slick, well-made products from the Hollywood factor and slick this isn't. \"Memories\" is engaging because of its clumsiness, rough-around-the edges small town quality, and even situational humor\u0097things you don't expect from thrillers, much less one based on dead serious real life situations.",

The one sex scene is borderline hilarious and true to life. Funniest sequence of all is when the lead detective is looking in the sauna for the hairless suspect. And when he told the sauna staff to look out for the hairless one \"They just smirked at me!\" The various interrogation scenes are very well done. The conflict among the detectives is very convincing.

            "content": "SPOILERS AHEAD...\nBong Joon-Ho's Memories of Murder ends with Detective Park staring directly at the lens with his eyes brimming with tears. What does this look symbolize? Is he seeking for answers? Is he expressing his plight to the audience? Or is he using his eyes, like he did throughout the entire film, to conclude whether we, the audience, are innocent or guilty? There are very few films which acknowledge the presence of the audience. And when they do, they bridge the gap between the characters on screen and the audience. What ends up striking is an emotional resonance with the events that occurred in the film...Set is in the late 1980s', in a rural town in South Korea, Memories of Murder recounts events that are based on real killings. Fourteen women were brutally murdered, and the detectives worked day and night to find the killer. The two main leads are Detective Park, who is a country detective; and Detective Suh who is a detective from the city of Seoul aiding in the investigation. A sense of tension and clash is prevalent between the two detectives. This sense of clash is reflected by the film's tone.From the opening sequence of the film, Bong masterfully establishes the absurdity and clash of situations that was occurring in the 1980s'. On one hand, you witness adorable children laughing, playing around the paddy fields, and making fun of Detective Park's broken-down vehicle. And on the other hand, Detective Park discovers a young woman's dead body underneath a trench. And on top of that, it is a bright and beautiful sunny day.Just like the characters, we experience the same emotions: confusion and appalment. The visuals begin with a warm and golden glow, signifying the delicacy of innocence and how it clashes with disorder and chaos. Taro Iwashiro's score does a magnificent job in accentuating the tone of the film. On the surface, the music utilizes the bright harmony of the piano chords as a reflection of the sunny weather; yet the piece embodies this underlying emotion of sadness, despair, and melancholy which persists throughout the entire film.The 1980s' was an unsettling and disturbing time for South Korea. The country was underneath the military dictatorship, which caused the society to experience chaos and disorder on a frequent basis. The underlying sense of chaos is established in the next four scenes, when Detective Park fails to stop a tractor from mowing the footprints of the killer. In a single shot, the camera anxiously follows Detective Park, who demands every individual to stay organized and Song Kang-Ho brilliantly enunciates the anguish Detective Park feels at that moment.The anguish and frustration of the detectives is reflected by the film's gray color palette. Every scene is filled with tension. This idea of a storm that is lurking behind the detectives is reflected by the gloomy weather. Unlike most crime dramas, the detectives are not the sharpest in this film. They are quite inept at their job. They use brute force to find the answers to this killer's motivation. Bong eases the tension by using black humor. The detective's ineptness is treated with humor. On one hand, Detective Park abuses one of the suspects, who turns out to be innocent. And in the next few scenes, he gifts the suspect a fresh pair of shoes. The sheer unreliability of the narrative and the character's actions is what makes the slow pace of the film invincible.However, the humor does come to an end. The killings continue and the detectives continue to fail on their attempt to catch the killer. The emotions of fatigue and anxiety start to emit from the behavior of the characters. Just like the detectives, we, as an audience, are disgusted and frustrated by the death of these young women. The rise in the pacing complements the restlessness of the detectives. And the weather becomes even more dark and gloomy...Bong brilliantly uses his actor's talents to communicate this shift in emotion and behavior. Song Kang-Ho beautifully channels the complexities of Detective Park. He maintains the balance between the brute and violent nature and the sad and desperate nature of his character so brilliantly. One cannot help but laugh at his ineptness, but one cannot help but empathize with his zest to catch the killer. The foil to his character is also channelized beautifully by Kim Sang-kyung. As the stern and meticulous Detective Suh, he brilliantly uses his body and his eyes to convey his commitment and dedication to the case. This is especially evident in the film's tear-inducing climax. Detective Suh's emotions are in harmony with the audience's emotions and his madness mirrors the audience's madness towards the grueling nature of the case. The explosive emotions beautifully brim from the screen. The sound of the rapid rain and Taro Iwashiro's haunting strings being in harmony is nothing but hypnotic. Even better, a crisscross of character arcs happens in the climax - how often does that occur? The in-depth exploration of both Detective Park and Detective Suh is highlighted in the film's climax. Detective Suh loses the belief that documents never lie; Detective Park loses the belief that his \"special vision\" works. Detective Suh has nothing but the zest to use brute force to bring justice and order to the case; Detective Park has nothing but the desire to detach from the fatigue that the case has enforced upon him...The killer is not caught in the end. The story has no resolution to it. The memories of Detective Park's experience with the case will continue to haunt him. On the surface, it seems that he has a successful career as a salesman and a beautiful family. However, the sheer defeat from the unsolved case will continue to pervade in his future. Bong, once again, introduces the same paddy fields and sunny weather to mirror Detective Park's memories. As well as signifying the inevitability of these memories fading away from his existence. The thought of not knowing the killer and the soul-shattering guilt of that thought is symbolized by his sad look to the audience. He looks directly at the camera with the hunger and zest he had in his past. The brim in his eyes represent the fear and anxiety he has of failing to draw any conclusion...The beautiful thing about cinema is how it uses images to shape our knowledge and beliefs about a particular experience. It uses the face and eyes of the characters on screen to shape our understanding of the situations and the outcomes of those situations. It transcends the lines of division and we, as an audience, become the characters for those two hours. In those two hours, when there is no resolution, like Detective Park, we too will be haunted and overwhelmed by the reality that our memories of this beautifully tragic film will never fade away, even when the screen itself will, inevitably, fade to black...",

            "content": "This movie definitely caught me off guard. I had this movie lying around the house for a month and I finally managed to watch it. Man I wish I had seen this movie earlier.The plot is nothing special. Set in a rural area a killer kidnaps, rapes and then kills girls. The local police are having a tough time catching him so a detective from the city is assigned to the area to help them investigate the crime. You would think that this is a straight forward action packed crime thriller of a movie however this is far from it.I particularly like the fact that this film actually engages the audience with it's character development. For example, at the start of the movie we are introduced to a local cop Park Doo-Man (Kang-ho Song) who is portrayed almost as a street-wise smooth talking cop who use brutality to get what he wants. This image of him stays the same throughout the film until near the end. Whereas the detective from the city Seo Tae-Yoon played brilliantly by Sang-Kyung Kim is the opposite of Park Doo-Man. He prefers to do things with rationality, fair judgement and the usage of scientific methods rather than basing decisions on instincts and irrational thoughts which Park Doo-Man is best at doing. As the film progresses, the murderer continues to kill and the detectives are left with useless clues which lead them to another.And this is where the character development aspect of the movie really shines. After wandering around fruitlessly they become exhausted. Seo Tae Yoon who, originally was opposed to Park Doo-Man's brutal and vicious interrogation methods goes and says 'we just need to beat a confession out of him'. As an audience we can feel the detective's exhaustion and frustration and it just makes you eagerly wanting to know who the killer is.The whole setting itself, in a rural area adds to the tension and suspense. Technology is scarce, and in a period where protests and riots are occurring, you can't help but think that these detectives are on their own in this case. They have to use old methods to get what they want. The change in weather also adds to the suspense. When it is raining it creates a sense of feeling that the killer is about to strike which he inevitably does.The ending itself is what will tick most people off but not in a bad way. It certainly got to me but I should've known since it is based on a true story. I won't spoil it there for you however it should be obvious to you at the start of the movie.Overall this is Korean cinema at it's best. This film has some great comedy moments blend with great drama, tension and suspense. There are some disturbing scenes however that shouldn't put most viewers off. The whole film is shot beautifully with some scenes being gritty and others being peaceful. Its one of the best crime thriller I've seen in my life. I would certainly say its up there with Insomnia and Se7en. I wish to see more of these kind of movies in the future.",

            "content": "\"Salinui chueok\" or \"Memories of Murder\" is a South Korean movie from 2003 that runs for over 2 hours and it is the second full feature film by Bong Joon Ho and it catapulted him into the elite of Asian filmmakers where he has stayed to this day. Of course BJH is getting a lot of recognition for his very recent movie \"Parasite\" and now he is 50 years old and back then he was in his early-/mid-30s and also his talent was pretty visible. I am actually curious to see Parasite at some point in the next weeks, but today I watched this one here and I was not disappointed. Okay, the imdb Top250 inclusion is definitely too extreme, but I had a fun time all in all. Well, \"fun time\" may not be the best description for this one in terms of the subject, but there were always slight comedic inclusions as well, most of them involving the incompetence of the police there. With this I am of course talking about the police officer pretty much at the center of the story who thinks the killer who sexually abused and murdered several women must be a monk because there was not a single hair to be found at the crime scenes. Or when he gets that sheet and liquid and says the image will be the looks of the perpetrator. Oh well, he seemed to be serious with that and that made it somewhat funny. In general, you could say that the foolishness and cluelessness of the police was a big factor here really. But also in a more critical way because really some suspects are attacked really violently by some brute also working for the police and there is uproar in the media because of that too. I am mostly talking about the disabled guy, but also the exhbitionist they find later on and they are both innocent. As for the mentally disabled guy, it all ends in a tragic way sadly too and you could only feel bad for him. But there karma strikes too becase the aforementioned brute eventually loses his leg, the one that has been doing the harm through a freak accident, and again there the stupidity of the police shows because the doctor says that they should have taken him to a hospital right away to keep tetanus from happening right away. And also the bigger, chubbier police officer (the one who sings on one occasion) is not exactly too competent, even if he does not see it like that and thinks he is really smart and gifted when he complains about a farm vehicle destroying footprints. But he is also the one who beats up the police inspector from Seoul who comes to assist the team and boy they really need him. But yeah, very strange he gets beaten up by the central character because the latter out of nowhere suspected that he was molesting women. And finally, their boss. Oh well, he is a fruitcake too. The brief scene with his wife was still harmless, but he does not have his team under control one bit really, not even when he beats up one of his officers. Violence sure was more of a thing back then in the police force it seemed compared to today. Or let's say compared to today here in the western world. No idea what the state of things is in Asia these days. At least in North Korea things probably won't look too different still. As for the South no idea, but admittedly, it made for some solid comedy value in here, so I won't complain.Also, what I would like to mention because I am just talking about North and South was one reference I found interesting as we see at an all-girls school people being trained for the worst case scenario, a military attack, and we have to keep in mind that even today the situation between these countries is not exactly promising, but back then, it was even worse and definitely a possibility that there could be a war again. But let us not drift too far away from the film now. Like I said, I enjoyed it all in all. Sometimes it did feel a bit unrealistic, but maybe that is just me. Like for example, why did they take that long to ask the mentally challenged man about what he saw? Okay they thought the cop just made up a story for him, but this cop knew better. He should have stayed on him because he is an important eye witness and they should have known right away. Or near the end when we have the final suspect, it seemed a bit too easy that they just identify him from his name on the letters he wrote to the radio station. He does not seem this stupid honestly. This made very little sense to me regardless of what you may think about the whole music song idea that he always kills when this one plays in the radio and when it is a dark and rainy day. It's okay I guess, but could have been better. Same about the car not starting when the suspect leaves in the bus. A bit too much of a coincidence perhaps. Coincidence maybe is not the filmmaker's biggest strength and he should have included less of it. This also refers to the lady who has been crying so hard. I mean her dog could have died, but the fact that she was attacked by the killer too comes a bit out of nowhere really. There is also no further elaboration on how she survived. Not looking him in the eye is too vague of an explanation really. Perhaps he still wasn't too good at his craft at that point. Very simple explanation actually, but I wish they could have given this one or another. So yeah there are flaws with this movie and there are things wrong, but I still think that all in all the good here is more frequent than the bad. Like I said it flew by almost and that is always a good sign for a film with this running time. Overall, no hesitation for me in giving this one a thumbs-up, but a truly memorable movie it is not and I am baffled by the many people who call it a masterpiece or/and give it a perfect 10 out of 10 rating. That would be all then. As for the actors, I cannot really say too much as that deep into Korean cinema I am not, but the awards recognition here speaks for itself I suppose. Go check this one out unless you really dislike Asian films. The open/unhappy ending also makes it really worth it. This is not made to please the audience, at least not on that occasion. It depicts reality, especially taking into account that the time they had to find him and get him to prison is now almost over because of the limitation period. That would be all. Thumbs up.",

The movie is a great example of how in real life the killer may never get caught.

The movie takes place in the village area where the actual crime happened.The screenplays was written well, the cast was chosen good.For the time of 2003 it was definitely something unique, and some kinda Game Changer.Bong Joon Ho merges many elements from different genres together into a thrilling crime movie. So dramatic and intense with breaks at the right time. The buildup was good.I highly recommend to watch the movie on prime right now. I watched the movie in undoubtedly trrrible quality last year. So I came here to write a little review when I watched the movie in high def. I could write so much more don't watch a trailer cuz most of them are fan made and none of them has the atmosphere of the movie. I actually think about to watch the movie in its original language just to see how it feels like.It became my favorite movie of all time. GO WATCH IT!",

            "content": "Now I'm not too familiar with the Korean film industry, and to see this as my second Korean film, I have to say it amazes me deeply and will resonate for years to come. Every minute that passed seemed to stick in my head and I kept wondering, 'I don't want this to end!'.Cinematography, music, acting, tone, colour and direction all make the film glimmer in its gritty dull setting of 1980s Korea. I immensely adore the shots director Joon-ho Bong creates. The characters all fit in well in steady still shots or they move erratically in moving shots.Frankly, I know the relationships between the two main characters, Kang-ho Song as Detective Park and Sang-kyung Kim as Detective Seo may seem a little cliche, however they both seem so natural in their roles and as well as the other supporting characters, it really makes for a memorable film. Song's deep, pressing stare is simply a sight to see. His eyes that look straight at the lens challenged me into finding my own conclusion of the events in the film.All that has taken place is truly spectacular. I'll never see this again in terms of a crime-thriller. It's unique in its own way. I highly recommend this film, not only as a starter to view more Korean films or on the basis of entertainment, but to simply take in the essence of movie magic.",

It's better than any recent Hollywood film I can think of, and one of the better detective/crime films I've seen in a while. I guess going in **SPOILER** I wasn't aware that is was based on a true story. I was upstairs during the opening credits, so I missed that little introduction line that stated that.I thought the end was powerful in that it left me hanging, and upon finding out it was based on a true story it hit even harder. I find most movies try to follow the \"cookie cutter\" approach... This obviously missed that lesson as it doesn't offer the typical Hollywood \"oohh, he did it\" type ending.

I didn't mind the comedy and made it seems more natural I was kinda bored with the American type production crime movies who they are 100% drama.

It's a movie without any ending and the one that attaches a hook to you brain and won't let it go. From the publicity posters to the editing, writing and acting this movie is a thoughtful work. At times it would seem like reading an old novel and at times it would seem like watching a nemesis film. There are many flavors which work because of the terrific acting jobs everyone has done. Every character is a perfect fit. Both of the lead cops are opposite to each other and then the shift in their personality to take each other's place. The suspense is very strongly kept through out the movie and there is a ground breaking background score to lift it to new heights. The chase seen from the woods into the village and then the factory site is very thrilling. Another scene involving the train accident is also placed right. There would not be any department or field this movie could be less then great at. Kang-ho Song, is the best thing in the movie. His portrayal of an aggressive cop is top notch. He brings all the humor and then the intensity in the movie. Sang-kyung Kim, also gave wonderful performance. A cop with less known background which is civilized and honest to his job and then loses his control over the event. A movie which will be on your favorite lift forever.",

            "content": "One might expect that biggest challenge with a Korean film would be the subtitles. You'd be wrong. Though I have seen films from all over the globe in the original cut, with subtitles, Korean films are, and have always been, in a class by themselves. Part of this is because of the technical perfection. I have never before encountered a country where even the second-string directors (not the case with this film!) are so lacking in error, so crisp in technical perfection. But understanding that fact only sets you up for the larger puzzle. Korean films are never about what they seem to be about. Yes, I know that is a broad statement and may get me in hot water with any reader who strides over 100 earlier reviews to get to my late entry. But that is the truth. This film, a blockbuster hit in its native land, is a good example. Over two hours long -- feels like 90 minutes -- it seems to be a police procedural about a serial killer in the boondocks. Except the killer (spoiler) is never found. Except much of the film is more focused on the ineptitude, lack of equipment, jocularity, and cruelty of the cops. It is almost as though the director is challenging you to decide which is more interesting -- capturing the killer, or become gobsmacked by what passes for police work? This is not CSI Korea. This is more like Keystone Cops Korea. Yet, whatever choice you make, the film remains as compelling and yet puzzling as ever. This reviewer, having seen several dozen Korean films, each of equally astonishing quality, believes that the split between North and South has created like a void in the very DNA of Korea and its people. The pain of this void is so great that even when a story seems to be about something else entirely, the real story is the disconnect between two halves of the same whole, and the sorrow it brings. This is a superb film, whatever you think it means, and highly recommended.",

            "content": "Memories Of Murder\nMy Favorite Bong Joon Ho flick\nWhen I had watched Zodiac I was truly in awe as this was one of the few psycho killer mystery movies that spent more time on the people working on the case and how their obsessions act on their personal lives, than the killer himself. So after getting to know about about Bong Joon Ho I stumbled upon this movie and oh my what a movie it was!!Its basically related to the series of rape and murder cases which took place in South Korea in 1980s. It was funny, emotional, tense all while exploring the troubles faced by the cops during these murders.So basically it is the efforts of cops of a rather dull and quiet village to track down a series of related murders in that area and the effects that case has on them. Bong wrapped so many themes and showed the obsessions of the cops to track the killer down and the measures they took to achieve it makes Zodiac look unpolished. All the characters are written well and the 3 lead cops play off each other beautifully. There were moments which were really funny, quite unexpected in this genre but that's what Bong does so well in all of his movies that he changes the tone so abruptly which a lot of the other directors fear to do. Some moments were so filled with tension that I was literally biting my fingernails off! The Screenplay was magnificent as well in balancing the humor and the serious tone of the movie. Cinematography should be applauded also as the scenes with the fields and the grass added to the story of the movie. The long tracking shots were done seamlessly. And the acting was top notch especially by Song Kang Ho who plays a lazy but somewhat talented cop who is way out of his depth in this case and also by Kim Sang Kyung who plays the younger but more experienced cop from Seoul. Anyways in terms of the technical departments there is absolutely no complaints whatsoever.The thing which impressed me the most was how the people reacted to the inquiries made by the cops. The enquiries were shown to be hostile as the cops were more concerned with closing the case rather than catching the killer. Bong took a dig at the cop system of interrogation of the olden days and also the reason for the cops in interrogating that way. During a lot of cases we never care about how the police are struggling or how bad the situations are for them at all. And then coming to the last 30 or so minutes! Waw it was just awesome. The frustration built up and up till that moment and then bang!!Hit you right in the gut.I haven't given you any spoilers as this is a movie not a lot have seen so I strongly suggest everyone to watch and appreciate a true masterpiece in acting, writing, cinematography and most importantly the directing.\nThank you",

Indeed after a certain point there is a serie of plot twists that changes rapidly the possible solution of the case and also the characters themselves. And the finale is great, i liked it very much and it will resinate with you after the watching. I have to say that during the movie I never felt a lot of suspense and it should be a negative point since it is a story about a mysterious serial killer that seems uncatchable but some hours after I was thinking about the movie and I finally felt the anxiety. And this is because of the settings, the characters and most importantly the desaturated colours chosen that are cold and very suggestive in a scary way. All these elements, along with the serial killer itself, conveys this dark aurea that I wasn't able to perceive immediately because I was very much into the case trying to guessing out who the culprit was and figuring out the next moves. The movie also critiques the fallibility of humans and investigators and the use of torture to have a confession.\nIn conclusion to enjoy \"Memories of murder\" you have to wait 30 minutes but then it's a great movie that you should try to watch.",

I have seen only two Korean movies in my life so far and both have been among my favorites \u2013 this one and Oldboy. If that's not a sign to watch a few more of Korean cinema, I don't know what is.At its heart, the story is based on a real life incident in the 1980's in a small province in South Korea. A couple of women are found murdered - their corpses mutilated and their faces gagged with their underwear. It's a brutal crimes, the kinds of which has probably not been witnessed before in this sleepy town and the bumbling local detectives prove themselves hardly adept at apprehending the perpetrator. Crimes scenes are muddied over, evidence mishandles and suspects brought in on a whim to be tortured or otherwise brutally interrogated by the two cops put in charge. A third detective, who comes from Seoul, is assigned to help them and his evident disdain for the local cops' methods and his reasoning of this being in fact the work of a serial killer puts him initially on the wrong foot. However, when a third murder in similarly creepy circumstances is uncovered, the serial killer theory appears validated.That may seem like another cop movie on serial killers and their hunt, but it is anything but. The story is taken as merely a canvas to paint a wide tapestry of human emotion and character which focuses more on the internal demons which haunts each of these characters. The cinematography and music perfectly captures this mood \u2013 slow burning, understated, grime tinted and devastatingly effective. This is not a neatly wrapped up ready to order thriller. This is a movie where the cinematic techniques and writing are at their most superlative. The ending can be considered open ended, unsettling and maybe unsatisfying for some, but bear in mind \u2013 this was based on a true story, and this was never meant to be just about the case. A more popular movie which it brings to mind is David Fincher's underrated but very good movie, Zodiac, in terms of its similarities of theme and approach, but I would say this is still miles ahead of that little gem. This is brilliance painted on the canvas of our movie screen. One of the rare 10's I'm giving.",

The story based on a series of deaths at Gyunggi, in South Korea and the police department's individual handling the case. The initial supposedly random death becomes a thrilling game between the serial killer and the cops. The clues which they use to identify the misfortune involved in finding the result of each of the case is what really the core ideology of this masterpiece. The actors are uniformly brilliant , be it the chief investigator from the town, his mental sidekick, the inspector from Seoul and the chief. The various suspects add more mystery to the case than reveal it. The methods used for identifying the culprit are innovative and refreshing.

Story, acting and filmcraft all are first rate and come together to show what life was like in South Korea in the mid 80's and weaves the story of of a small group of policemen and policewomen around and through that daily life. The portrayal of the cops is honest and brutal. They are as flawed as any of us are and do things they shouldn't. Their own frustration with the system is apparent as they take it out on suspects and each other. The Korea of the 80's is also fascinating as students riot and the whole population practices Civil Defense drills.The murders are dealt with almost entirely from the cops POV; that is, we see the aftermath and search for clues and evidence. There is plenty of frustration there as the cops we get to know can't get enough uniformed police to control crowds of gawkers and stop people destroying evidence by stepping on it as the murders continue.See this movie if you like detective stories, or murder mysteries or if you like true event dramatizations.But the main reason to see is it's just an all around good movie.",

First hour of this movie moves quite slowly, many investigations and jokes in it which is enjoyable to see. It shows how real-life detective investigates, makes suspect confess and sometimes cheats the evidence if it's necessary. And last an hour of this movie is so tense and brilliant, especially near ending of it. Bong Joon Ho shows his genius idea by adapted an unsolved true story into a terrifying and memorable film, also combining with some jokes that makes 'Memories of Murder' not boring to watch. What makes it different from other detective movies are some unclear evidence doesn't always lead it to the killer, perhaps it's just an accidental or coincidence. For me, 'Memories of Murder' is one of the best crime movie ever created and the one that could be remembered for a long time.",

It wasn't so much about the victim's deaths or the murderer as it was about the people who were having to investigate it. I love movies that focus in on that aspect because you know that this stuff really stays with the investigators long after things come to an end. The cases they never solve haunt them. This is supposed to be a thriller and it does come with some suspense but it is more dramatic mystery than anything else. That was a bummer for me because I was never really on the edge of my seat so I wouldn't recommend it if you are looking for big thrills and suspense. However, if you are looking for a mystery this is a great choice.",

            "review_title": "Arguably the greatest crime thriller ever",
            "content": "The crime thriller genre is something that is particularly difficult to pull off. Most films of the genre end up being simple predictable and unoriginal. Even a lot of the films that are supposed to be great in the genre just end up being dull and forgettable. Luckily there are exceptions, films that break the clich\u00e9s and tropes of the genre. One of these rare exceptions is Jong Boon-Ho's Memories of Murder.Bong Joon-Ho is a Korean director, though while being popular in his home-country of Korea, and while never receiving any main-stream attention or praise here in the west it still has a massive cult following. Memories of Murder though not his first film was the first to get him noticed. The film is based on a string of murders in the small town of Hwaesong. The serial killer ends up being more that the small town detective, Park Doo- man, (played by Korean actor, Kang-ho Sang famous for his roles in Sympathy For Mr. Vengeance, and The Host) can handle. So detective Seo Tae-yoon (played by Sang-kyung Kim) from Seoul is brought out to help the local police to catch the killer. And very clearly he was needed, the local police are very clumsy when handling evidence, and often resorts to beating confessions out of people they think are guilty. Needless to say Seo and Park clash. They end up spending more time fighting with each other than they do looking for the murderer. This clash never feels forced, like it does in some movies. This is because the characters are well written and well acted, not cartoonish one dimensional clich\u00e9s. But as more and more bodies pop up the detectives quickly become desperate, resulting in am intense heart-stopping third act.Bong Joon-Ho crafted arguably the best cat and mouse serial killer film ever. But how did he do this? Well there was no one thing he did that made it so very great instead it was a large amount of different things that came together to make it a masterpiece. I already mentioned how the characters were written and performed. But another that he does that most American directors don't dare try is have happy comedic moments in the film. This is so very effective because by juxtaposing the comedic scenes with the darker ones make each stronger and more memorable. Few directors true to do this, because there's a fine line between making the film tonally stronger, or just tonally confusing your audience. Another thing that Bong Joon-Ho uses to make Memories of Murder fantastic is world building. First the film is nearly entirely shot on cloudy days, (a tactic the David Fincher would later use in several of his films.) and throughout the film their is a constant state of \"panic,\" for example in one scene when Seo goes to a school, the school children are conducting some sort of drill for an emergency situation. Or in another when sirens are blasting in the streets and someone says over the speakers that it is just a test. Bong Joon-Ho is also a master of directing the audience he knows exactly where to put are focus, and how to move the focus to be sure to keep us interested. Bong Joon-Ho's direction actually matches the story structure, how the detectives constantly shift form suspect to suspect desperately trying to find the killer. And not to mention the films strongest part: the ending. I'm not going to spoil it, but nothing in the world will prepare you for it. And I think it's safe to say that it will cause your jaw to drop, and you won't be able to get it out of your head for days.I said it at the begging of the review, but I'll repeat it. Bong Joon-Ho has never received any mainstream success or recognition, (at least in the west.) but nevertheless his influence is undeniably. Quentin Tarantino named Memories of Murder as one of his 20 favorite films since 1992. And Memories of Murder was definitely the main inspiration of David Fincher's Zodiac. There are to many similarities between the two to deny that, not to mention that Zodiac came out only 4 years after Memories of Murder was first released. But even though major publications and websites have not given Bong Joon-Ho any mainstream success, he has developed a loyal cult following, and rightly so.",

This one is the best that I have ever seen. People accustomed of seeing a happy ending to all tragic stories might feel disappointed with this movie, but for me that was even better. You are left to think, analyze and scratch your head at the end, but by no means the ending could have been better. I was completely on the edge of my seat for the whole movie. I also showed the movie to some of my friends and suddenly everyone opened their eyes for Korean filmmaking , craving for more movies. Besides thrill, this movie also takes you to the deep emotional rides by portraying the mental pressure on cops dealing with criminal cases.The protagonist is one the best actors around ( http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0814280/ ). The way he has portrayed his role of a \" not so good \" cop is amazing. Watch movies such as Host, Thirst, Secret Reunion, J.S.A to enjoy Kang-ho-Song's performance. Not a single scene of this movie is out of context and useless. Worth watching once and many more times.. If I could find nothing better than this, then for me; this is 10/10.",

What amazes me is that a movie that speaks a language you don't understand and takes place in a country/culture you have very little idea about can connect to you on various levels, move you and disturb you.Memories of Murder is an ingeniously made crime thriller that keeps you engaged right from the beginning to the very end. It is very hard to find a dull moment in the movie. Be it the writing or the acting or the cinematography or the BGM, this movie is literally flawless. It is crafted with such perfection that it is almost hard to believe you are watching a movie. It felt like you are witnessing these incidents unfold, right before you. The wide range of emotions, stress, and pain a detective goes through while handling a case is beautifully portrayed by the two lead actors. Kang-ho Song and Sang-kyung Kim, with their incredible acting skills, effortlessly take us through the lives and hardships of detectives. Though both the characters differ from each other in many ways, we are able to relate to them at one point or other. Asians are stereotyped for having small eyes (there are a couple of subtle references in this movie too!) and it must be an irony that almost all the characters in this movie emote flawlessly through their eyes.The landscape plays an important role in the movie. It sets the tone right from the beginning - Cold, silent, intimidating and vast. The countryside is picturized exquisitely that even though it is subtle at most places, it gives a sense of eeriness wherever it's required and at the same time it kind of comforts you wherever it's needed.The last few minutes is where the movie peaks and leaves you heart- breaking. You can't help but feel for the detectives who gave their everything to catch the murderer but lost to circumstances. The end scene where the retired detective converses with a girl sums up the entire movie and we feel the exact same way as he feels - frustrated, clueless and unfortunate. As he gazes through the screen, we are left with an empty feeling of not knowing what to do after watching an amazing movie.",

            "review_title": "Interesting in parts, but ultimately dated and un-engaging",
            "content": "This highly acclaimed film by debut director Bong Joon-ho won best new director award at the San Sebastian Film Festival and was a box office smash in Korea. It follows the story of rural detective, Park's, (Kang-ho Song) unprofessional response to the true story of Korea's first serial killings which took place in 1986. These murders were complicated and pre-meditated, taking place on rainy nights after a particular song had played on the radio, and involving the fetishistic binding and gagging of the female, red clothed, victims. The local police response is to plant evidence, beat suspects for a confession, and consult a Shaman. Luckily an educated detective, Seo, (Sang-kyung Kim) is sent in from Seoul, who believes in scientific methods and logically analysing evidence. This sets up much of the films tension due to the friction between the two leading detectives individual approaches, which come down to the battle between instinct and science. The film is certainly well constructed with strong performances from the entire cast, but it is ultimately unfulfilling. It is aimed firmly at the Korean audience, which may mean that the cultural differences form a barrier between the characters and some Western viewers. Whatever the reason the film remains un-engaging due to the difficulties in emoting with the protagonists. The film also covers old ground, with themes that have been covered a thousand times before in more original ways. Instead of looking like a film set in 1986, it gives the impression that it was made in that year. In typical buddy movie fashion the two detectives begin to learn from each other, and about the nature of their profession. The philosopher Nietzsche states that those who do battle with monsters must take care that they do not thereby become a monster, which is relevant here as Seo begins to throw off his logical methods in favour of beating the suspect he feels is guilty. Meanwhile Park relies less on instinct and leans more towards the logical and analytical approaches. This coupling of opposites had the opportunity to be interesting viewing. However, perhaps the films biggest downfall is also the one aspect that gives it any originality. This is based on a true story, a story in which the killer was not found. This means that the story can only be told from the point of view of the police, leaving the audience in the same frustrating position as the detectives. In thrillers of this type it is customary to have a non restrictive narrative, so that the audience can see what the killer is plotting even if the identity is never revealed. It then becomes a series of moves and counter moves, a puzzle to be solved, rather than a frustrating journey of banging your head against a wall, in which no questions are answered. There are touches of humour that lighten the heavy mood, but it is perhaps the scenes that are not supposed to be funny, such as some of the violent assaults by the detectives, that become the most comedic due to their slapstick tendencies. Another well trodden theme is that it is the ordinary person that commits the most extraordinary acts of violence. Park is sure that the killer must be a pubic hair shaving psychopath rather than, as the audience will have already guessed, an average person. Parks realisation of this is handled competently in the films haunting closing scene. Twenty years after the murders Park has changed careers and is now a salesman that happens to pass by the first crime scene of the murders. Whilst he is there a young school girl comments that another man had been their recently and spoke of how he had done something at that location long ago and wanted to remember it. When Park presses for a description she replies \"ordinary\", which is the moment of enlightenment for this character, who then stares, not at the camera lens, but into the audience, where the killer may well be sitting.",

The style and tone of the film constantly alludes and reminds the audience of the Japanese director Immamura Showei(Unagi, Vengeance is Mine), while the narrative structure seems too plotted according to the film's genre predecessors. For instance serial killer who gets stimulated by color red and rain while good/bad cop buddies come together in an expected fashion.

To solve the murder case in which the killer rapes and gags the women with their underwear, they just brutally beat up every suspect in their ham-fisted way so Detective Seo Tae-yoon (Sang-kyung Kim)who seems more like a professional who knows what he is doing is sent from Seoul to assist them in the case.

Acting, direction, screenplay... the movie is full of life. A perfect blend for a stunning crime thriller. It is the best Korean movie & the best thriller I've ever seen. Highly recommended!",

The only movie I can think of to rival this masterpiece is Joint security area (also starring Kang-ho Sung) and that's saying a lot.I had the chance to see it during a film festival in Sweden a few years ago, and I've watched it 3 times on DVD after that, and it gets even better the more I watch it. The film present you with a lot of gags together with several deep moments of sharing the pain of the victims. So don't just expect a heavy Asian flick, filled with understated emotions, try this and you will go on a roller coaster of emotions, from total happiness to complete sadness within a few minutes.",

The characters and their developments were really well made.The story however, was intriguing at first, but after being fed new leads and new doubts over and over again, it becomes frustrating. A common exercise is to try and figure out the story ahead of time, but this will only lead to a headache if attempted. Another downside was obviously the conclusion, which was on one hand anti-climatic while also being anti-clich\u00e9, but regardless, a better conclusion would have done this movie such a much needed favour...",

But unfortunately, so deep that if i didn't know any better i would've thought it goes round and round and round into nothing. Don't get me wrong, it's a high quality film and very well directed by Bong Joon Ho. But to me, it felt very average and there is no resolution to the story. It makes me questioned, what was the point ? If there's point at all.Anyway, if you're into film like Mystic River (to me personally it gives off the same vibe), and like foreign films you should check it out. If not, then i wouldn't really recommended it.6.5/10.",

Not in habits, or beliefs. I mean the slightly different ways of actually SEEING, CAPTURING the world, the life, everything. Accents put in different places. Those differences result in odd (in western criteria) choices made by Asian storytellers - directors. When You see movie of Asian director who works in Hollywood, you experience those differences less. But when he is a \"local star\" (like Joon-ho Bong), a local vision would be presented by him, for you resulting in few little internal short circuits.So I THINK \"Memories of Murder\" is a good movie.

It's a bleak, sombre film that's often rather upsetting. Its unwillingness to provide comfort or closure creates a uniquely downbeat tone, aligning its audience with its increasingly worn-out lead characters. It always keeps its focus on the investigation, rather than the crimes; as such, it feels rather unique when considered among its peers. Director Bong Joon Ho strikes a delicate balance between his trademark dark humour and the inherently heavy subject matter. The comedy never encroaches on the picture's sincerity and it seems, for lack of a better word, respectful. It's a remarkably well-made movie. The overall effect of the film is surprisingly profound; it sneaks up on you, in a way. It's a compelling and affecting crime drama. Its haunting end leaves you with the scary realisation that monsters are not only real, they're human. 8/10.",

            "content": "Based on a true story that occurred in a South Korean town from 1986 to 1991 during which 10 women were found gagged, raped & murdered by a serial killer, Memories of Murder is an extremely well-crafted, ingeniously narrated & intelligently paced mystery thriller about this very case file which not only qualifies as a defining example of its genre but is great enough to rank amongst the greatest films to come out from the South Korean film industry.The story of Memories of Murder begins in 1986 with the discovery of the first victim's dead body & concerns the investigation carried out by two detectives with very different working methods. The local one always ends up torturing innocent suspects into confession while the other one's research goes much deeper. Most of the story covers these two contrasting characters clashing with each other while trying to work together towards the same objective.Directed by Bong Joon-ho, who is notable for fusing elements of various genres into one tightly structured & greatly detailed story which is then often pierced with dark humour, Memories of Murder is his sophomore effort & of all the films he's made to date, this one is certainly the most balanced. The screenplay puts great emphasis on its two lead characters & their frequently conflicting opinions, and captures the real-life incident wonderfully as well.Cinematography exhibits an arresting visual beauty which contrasts with the very gruesome subject the film deals with. Editing cleverly lines up the different segments in a single file, resulting in a smooth, self-explanatory narration. And the background score has its moments as well. Further elevating the picture are quality performances from its talented cast & although it ranges from composed to crazy, everyone chips in nicely in their given roles, especially Song Kang-ho, his right hand man & Kim Sang-kyung.On an overall scale, Memories of Murder is an expertly handled cinema that puts on screen the most infamous case in the modern history of South Korea with admirable honesty & manages to creep its viewers out more than once but despite its bleak tone, it never turns into a gloomy experience & is an emotional roller-coaster ride for there are moments of unmistakable hilarity which comes from the idiosyncratic characters who are present in this picture in abundance. Inarguably one of Asian cinema's finest, Bong Joon-ho's magnum opus comes strongly recommended.",

Memories of Murder shows how to make a Classic Murder Mystery with unsolved case yet making better ending than many solved American or other thrillers. The film is inspired from true story of Korea's serial murders took place between 1986-1991. The plot revolves around the continuous murders, police investigation and the media pressure. Whenever it seems like the case is solved or if i say solved by a planning, we find out that the particular person is not guilty. The same series continues for 130 minutes but it has very comical and intriguing touch. I never felt bore while watching the film, instead of feeling like i wasted my time on unsuccessful investigation i generated interest for what would happen next. Yes, we are done with this suspect and he was very close but no he wasn't the one so who's next. I liked this drafting coming one after another. I was missing intelligent writing though, but then it was justified by the limited authority and technology available for regional Koreon team. Acting by all the actors is good especially by the all supporting actors who played the role of the suspect. Screenplay is little slow but okay. The writing may lack intelligence (for some valid reasons) but the kind of entertaining flavour it has and the kind of Climax it has, it cannot be questioned at last. May be dialogues could have been better because mysterious films must have some confusing and intricate one liners i feel. Bong Joon Ho as director does a great job, the way he presented this horrible World and the specific period is outstanding. Memories Of Murder is a film that will remain in your memories and you will always memorize it whenever you will see any Murder Mystery film with solved ending because this is Unsolved yet much more Powerful.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest",

What made this film more meaningful was researching the background of what was going on since it seemed to have historical meaning - and it does.A rape and murder crime occurs in a small town. The bumbling, simpletons who are the police round up the usual suspects believing that they may have the suspect of what may be the beginning of a serial murderer. But as things progress, they are sent in a special detective from Seoul whose methods are more scientific and precise, not left to pure small town bias. The local detectives begin to realize their own failings and need to find answers elsewhere and focus on another. And the path where it leads them is most unsettling. The dialog, acting and script are riveting. The film is painfully funny in certain places and deeply unsettling in others. Based on a true story, this isn't a horror film. It's crime / suspense with a meaningful script and character analysis. There is good reason why this film belongs in the best of all time. Highly recommended.",

            "content": "While he hit the big time with his multi-Oscar winning masterpiece of original film-making with this year's Best Picture recipient Parasite, South Korean director Bong Joon Ho has been going about his business of directional genius for a number of years leading up to his Academy Awards triumph.The Host, Mother and the initially underappreciated Snowpiercer are all films that could only be born from a masterful hand behind the camera but one of Ho's crowning achievements came in just his second feature length film, the based on a true story Memories of Murder.Feeling absolutely like a godfather of sorts to David Fincher's beloved serial killer epic Zodiac (a film which must surely have been inspired by Ho's tone and style in this film), Memories is a police procedural that values quieter moments over gun fights and brawls (even if there's more fly kicks here than you may've bargain for) as Ho examines the emotional toll the investigation into a series of grisly rapes and murders has on the police charged with tracking down the victims killer.Set in the more rural surrounds of South Korea during a national civil upheaval in the mid-late 80's, Memories starts out in typical Ho fashion with a mix of dark humor and outlandish characters but it slowly but surely morphs into something else much more contemplative and touching, much like the evolution of its main figure Detective Park Doo-man played by Parasite MVP Kang-ho Song.Initially an abrasive and almost idiotic protagonist, the potentially gifted Doo-man isn't a character we initially warm to but thanks to Ho's refreshing script and ability to draw us further and further into the mind games and cat and mouse like detective work going on around the case, Doo-man becomes a genuinely engaging figure, one that leads us to a haunting final scene that may not be what audiences expect, but one that perfectly fits what Ho is trying to achieve with his exploration of this case.Filmed for under $3 million USD, Memories is one of the best examples of the modern era when it comes to low-budget foreign film, so well put together and refined is this piece that many Hollywood products of a similar ilk would pail in comparison and while there are at times feelings as though not everything is given the time it deserves when there's so much ground to cover, when Memories clicks into gear, it provides some of the best detective/mystery cinema of the 2000's.Final Say -If Parasite had you clambering for more off-kilter and unpredictable cinema from the mastermind that is Bong Joon Ho, Memories of Murder should be your first port of call.4 1/2 out of no where fly kicks out of 5",

Memories of Murder is one such film. You got interesting characters, nice camera work & all the formula required for a stark serial killer thriller such as remote village, small old school police, innocence of the village, piano solo, big skies, empty fields & such; but there is nothing special for this movie to be rated highly. Also this ticks off multiple boxes useless romantic film critics hype up, you know the people who love The Shape of water & such films. I'm rating is a 6 fairly coz it wasn't poor, but wasn't great, wasnt even good. I don't recommend this film. I won't do that injustice. Bored as hell? You can watch this, but there's hundreds if not thousands of better thriller films out there better than this.",

            "review_title": "Egrigiously Bad South Korean Thriller",
            "content": "I'll follow the lead of a fellow IMDb user who reviewed this film negatively and merely list my biggest grievances with this South Korean thriller and add a conclusion at the end. This is not meant to list everything I found bad about this film but to give some rough outline about my thoughts on it.1) The detectives and sergeants involved in the case all commit numerous unforgivable and frankly unlawful acts outside and inside the job and suffer almost zero consequences, to the point that even with the knowledge that some extremely corrupt things do happen in the world you wonder if the setting is in fact supposed to mimic that real world or some fantasy land.The two bumbling in-house detectives torture and coerce suspects into confessing for the crime without the sergeant, some sort of internal affairs or anyone in the department interfering until way, way too late. And even when someone does interfere it's not because they recognize it's morally and lawfully reprehensible, it's because they found a new lead and therefore have no use for the suspect anymore. More puzzling is that the suspects don't sue or try to acquire some sort of reparations.One of the in-house detectives plants evidence and the detective brought in from Seoul to assist them seemingly does nothing about it.The other in-house detective assaults pedestrians and trashes a local restaurant while off-duty because of pressure involved in the case and seemingly the next day he's back on the job with no punishment incurred.2) The detectives and sergeants involved are way, way, way, WAY too incompetent to still be involved with a supposedly high-profile case after the second murder, let alone until the end of the movie. Again, is this a fantasy land?Suspects are released and given seemingly no further attention based on the word of a detective and evidence that are at best circumstantial and inconclusive. (Like seriously, they let their best suspect go because his hands were rough and a live victim described a rape from some years ago whose likeness is similar to the the case and she said the perpetrator had soft hands.) Crime scenes are mishandled very badly.The detectives follow a \"lead\" about the killer supposedly requesting a particular song in the same day the rape + murders are committed and yet don't think to ask the radio station for cooperation.On that note, why did the detectives think the song being requested is a promising lead in the first place? The detective from Seoul is ultimately revealed to be an emotionally-imbalanced wreck who takes cases too personally.3) Terrible deus ex machina, glaring inconsistencies and just outright unrealistic situations. A police officer finds the connection with a song being played on the same days of the murders based on absolutely zero narrative or logical precedence. She was never shown to be involved with the direct investigation of the case before that, never shown to be investigating the radio station in connection with the case, and the detectives were never interested in the radio station in the first place.The killer supposedly targets beautiful females wearing red and yet towards the end of the movie 2 victims are killed who weren't wearing red, one during a day that wasn't raining. With that how come the detectives were still persistent on the song + rainy day connection, even one of them going so far as attempting to kill the suspect who was found to be requesting the songs? What was the point of the peaches lodged in the victim's vagina? Why the bloody hell is the law essentially nonexistent in a police procedural film? There are no lawyers, search permits, or trials. With the evidence they had the detectives had no cause to detain any of the suspects for as long as they did and at one point they just stroll right into a residence and extract evidence just like that. In conclusion, like other critically-acclaimed South Korean thrillers (The Chaser, I Saw the Devil, etc.) this film has offensively bad writing that distracts from its solid acting, cinematography and premise. You will especially be offended if you've seen smarter and better crafted thrillers as this film is undoubtedly an affront to the genre.",

The 2 leads, Song Kang-Ho and Kim Sang-kyung give terrific, believable performances, well supported by a terrific cast as they try desperately to pin the killer down. I was not sure how Joon-ho was going to end this, but the last 5 minutes are so smart and absolutely spot on. Impressive.",

I like the mystery/suspense genre of movies, if anyone has seen the 'The Pledge' by Sean Penn where the main lead was played by legend Jack Nicholson then somewhere you will find the both story meets at some point in the movie. The actors are superb. The movie is all about the serial killer who kills womens on rainy day and whenever there is song 'Sad Letter'is played on radio. But nobody has clue who is the killer, the movie is bit over stretched,but the good thing is that the suspense remained through out. The detective from Seol joins the investigation and he is the one who actually do progress to find some facts which make this movie interesting to watch. But killer is too smart for them and the chase begins for nailing him.The problem about these kind of movies are that more and more short lived characters are introduced just to divert the curious viewer's interest to somebody else who actually has not killed anyone, but all evidence are found against him. Movie is superb and it retain the tension behind the complex characters and the relationship the detectives shared their anger,jealousy and competition are clear and understood well.The ending is also satisfying and it made sense because the case which is not solved ever in Korea is not manipulated into some strange ending.So friends what are you waiting for go and watch this movie and enjoy the suspense.",

            "content": "Memories of Murder is not your run of the mill crime thriller movie. There's usually a satisfying conclusion to it all, something that as we all know isn't always the case in reality. Loosely based on South Korea's first reported serial killings, Memories of Murder show the harsh reality of disorganised systems and how the process can break even the most principled of people.Crime thrillers with these types of antihero detectives usually show that their unorthodox ways of solving crimes are against regular and \"by-the-law\" procedures as a sort of rebellious act which almost always show that their methods were right in catching the culprit. But here it shows the reality of it all, it doesn't work if you have a \"detectives quirk\" like in those movies, doesn't matter if you have shamans eyes like they say in the movie- that's not what you need to catch a killer. In that sense this movie shows what a crime proceeding really can be in real life and how a brittle system under dictatorship and war can show how these cases just don't have a chance. No matter how much you put into it, which is a sad reality.This movie is GORGEOUS, very beautifully filmed. The Korean small town setting is shown in a very gritty but somehow lush manner- the shots are very methodical in contrast to how the crime proceedings that are unfolding in the movie are. As well as the music which is very melancholic and just as lush, the tones can be very heartbreaking and moody to everything that is happening.The actors are so AMAZING, everyone is believable and freaking bringing their A-game to this movie. No wonder Bong Joon Ho chose to work with them on The Host too and other movies as well, excellent.Negatives? None, I guess I'd say the ending but that's more of a personal taste thing I'd say. Since this is made to portray reality I understand why they chose that ending instead of something \"expected\" with these kinds of movies. Either way, pretty freaking excellent! Check it out!",

            "review_title": "Good but disappointing",
            "content": "After hearing unanimous rave reviews about the highest grossing Korean movie thus far (domestically I think) I had my hopes unrealistically high. The narrative was pretty good but I found the characters too much like caricatures and the events loosely based on reality were too overdone. This may be coming from my bias against buddy cop movies - I've seen way too many of them and really dislike them in most cases. Anyway, you have the local cops that beat up suspects just to get a confession and have a difficult time listening to the reason of the analytical big city detective. The one local cop that was so prone to violence seemed to lack the dimension of being much more than \"the bad cop\" or the sidekick. Meanwhile, the \"good\" local cop was pretty likable but his stubbornness not to follow the leads but to rather look for baldies or waste time torturing the suspects was a bit amusing but frustrating. The competition and jealousy and fighting with the city cop got old I thought and I felt the film focused too much on this \"this is my turf\" aspect of their relationship like rush hour or something. The city cop's change in his tactics also felt rushed and the tunnel scene near the end was just overtly melodramatic.I had the same problem with Taegukgi, another Korean blockbuster in that both of them dealt with a great setting, had some real thrilling scenes and were filmed superbly but just had tacked on overtly melodramatic and \"wow what a crazy coincidence\" type unrealistic situations to be taken seriously. Especially considering that this is based on real events. An example is that the girl that lead to the bathroom lead and who the city cop put the band-aid on ended up a victim, or that the guy gets hit by a train before they can get truthful info out of him, and other examples that may be nitpicky.Also I guessed that the scar guy was a witness and that the girl's lead was the best one waay earlier than the detectives did, I thought the first point was a little obvious early on. I really must fault a movie that makes me guess key parts before the detective does, I don't wanna feel that smart in a who-dun-it, I wanna be completely baffled! I'm not asking for some insane \"that character is a figment of your imagination\" twist (even if those are fun!) but just for enough subtlety to keep me questioning, not yelling at the detectives what's going on like \"He's speaking in the third person!!! GAH!!!\" Also I'm not sure whether it was designed but I laughed at the the beatings way more than I ought to have- I didn't feel seriously outraged until the guy hit the girl in the bar, the rest of the beatings seemed like playful big brother beatings or something.Anyway, I felt the movie was effective in the story-telling but it's the only highly touted Korean movie I've seen in which I took nothing away from. Sure it had characters who were split morally but I took away just about as much as this as I would a CSI episode (which I don't like anymore) The cinematography was really good yeah but the other great Korean movies I've seen have made me think and genuinely feel so much more (Save the Green Planet, Oldboy!, 3-Iron, Samaria, Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance and A Tale of Two Sisters are all top-25 movies for me) For this I was just like \"awww gross, peaches?\" and \"that damn psycho bastard\". The only moment I really felt and went \"WOW\" was when the killer was whistling in the field before tackling his victim- that and scenes similar to that warrant the acclaim. But otherwise this is just, to me, like a good mainstream Korea movie. I give this a 6.5 maybe 7ish on a good day - good use of the story, but thats all this movie is to me - a story with good thrills, the gross out factor and an efficient use of formula-inspired twists to entertain.",

I won't give any of the plot away because I think this is one of those movies where the less you know about it, the better. I will say this much, the story is beautiful. And beautifully told. It is so skillfully told as it unfolded I became so involved with the characters, the mystery and suspense that I completely forgot I was reading subtitles. Yes, the acting is that good.The quality of Asian cinema has grown leaps and bounds in the last ten years alone. This movie proves it. If Hollywood doesn't get a clue fast, they will simply be outclassed and will have to sit back and watch their box office returns get smaller and smaller each year.As it is right now, most of the regular movie goers I know prefer to venture to other parts of the globe when choosing which movies to see in theatres. Most of us will just watch a bootleg of a Hollywood film as opposed to taking a chance on paying to see it because the quality sucks with such regularity these days.However, I will be out spending my movie dollars on foreign films and Asian ones in particular. Hollywood can remake all the Asian films they want. I will be out seeing the originals!I saw this movie online for free with compromised visual quality and it still blows away every Hollywood movie I have seen in a theatre over the past few years.

That left me more dissatisfied than this film and i suppose it was because this smart university trained cop was pushed to this frustrating point where violence was his only release.

It is based on a true story and it tells the story of two detectives trying to solve the mystery behind the murders of women who were raped prior to the killings.In a small village in Korea, the killer is just... a rain... away from the next victim.The last scene - honestly - couldn't be a greater one. I was left speechless. One of those movies I wish I could forget so I can watch again and again like it is my first time.The acting was great too, I think the actors really did a good job.I truly enjoyed it and I absolutely recommend it to the ones who liked \"Zodiac\" as well.",

This movie was an interesting view, at times feeling too long but an ending that was very well thought out and executed.This movie is a slow burner based on real events and the acting, directing and cinematography was great. The opening sequence has great symbolic meaning as well as the ending. After you pass the first 30mins, the movie begins to pick up pace and become an interesting experience to the end.Because the movie ended on an intelligent note that sticks with you, I am giving this an 8/10 otherwise I would rate it 7.5 or 7.8Definitely check this movie out if you like a slow burning psychological thriller/drama movie",

After all, the film is a perfect masterpiece of its own genre. No doubt why and how it has attained the cult status. The film stays true to the genre, and that's why it can be called the best South Korean action-crime drama.Bong Joon-ho is known for experimental movies. And most of them have impressed the viewers. This film is no exception. Packed with powerful performances from Song Kang-ho and Kim Sang-kyung apart from a powerful script and an even powerful screenplay, the film has all the ingredients of an ideal entertainer. The film makes us feel a lot. Song Kang-ho lives the character he plays, and you can't separate his reel and real life characters. Kim Sang-kyung plays his natural best. He's got some terrific acting talent and displays it perfectly. Rest of the actors do a good job.The cinematography is excellent in many portions. The film is definitely worth watching in the highest quality available. The music is very melodious, and the one in the end will stay with you for long. Certain scenes have the excitement increased due to the powerful BGM. The action bits are decently done too.Undoubtedly, MEMORIES OF MURDER is the best and a masterpiece of its genre. You would've never seen a film like this. Song Kang-ho and Kim Sang-kyung won't let you just watch the film, they'll make you involved in the screenplay, and that's the biggest victory of the film.",

The screenplay is so good that you feel yourself to be a part of the lives of those detectives going about their jobs. How the failure in unraveling the whole mystery grows slowly on them, how the pressure piles up and the the transformations that each of them go through as movie progresses. Even out-of-focus characters are connected so well to the main story that it feels as if the story would not be complete without them.I don't want any part of the story to be given away, so I will keep it down to this. But in the end, I couldn't help but wonder: if this is based on a true story and if the killer is still at large, what must be going through his mind when he watches this movie?",

Police found a Suicide note from her which said she is suciding because she failed in exams but she had great score in exams. But then as police found the suicide note they declared it to be open n shut case and sadly no media covered it not a single as people believed it was done by some high profile person. The victims dead body pictures made me so furious and even more furious when it was declared open n shut case and no media reported, not even a celebrity took a stand. I was already disturbed at night somehow I slept and woke up next morning, I planned to watched the rest of the movie the climax as was curious to know what exactly happened, who did it n all.. I kept watching it till then end but the climax turned out to be something different, the last few minutes are like goosebumps, the feeling was similar which I had, was really touched.",

Its powerful to see the police struggling during military control in the midst of a dire situation. The most effective aspect of the movie has to be the fact they the killings continue to grow as the movie goes on, and the identity of the killer remains hidden. That being said, the tension is high and the police must act quickly with limited resources, so its not so much the killer is super human, but that the police are just as human. The movie stays basic, it doesn't involve elaborate SWAT teams, over the top shoot outs, crazy car chase scenes, but instead it stays grounded and unfolds simple clues to pinpoint the killers identity. This is one of the greatest movies of all time, a must see!Full Review at: http://www.simplefilmreviews.com/2014/05/memories-of-murder-2003.html",

This is a film hard to define if it's a comedy, suspense, or drama, actually, this film is everything and mixed up. The comedy scenes complement the suspense/drama of a police investigation into a serial killer. The director is not interested in cracking the case but in studying the behavior of police officers in solving the case.It's also interesting to note that each suspect is considered guilty until proven otherwise, it's fascinating to watch the many twists and turns in the plot. The cast is superb, the dialogue is intelligent without being pretentious. This is a great movie!!!",

            "content": "'Beauty in the eyes of the beholder' in the case of 'Memories of Murder' would explain reviewers giving this movie high-and-higher amount of stars. But folks, consider the story; shouldn't a flawed plot affect your ratings? Main example: The female police officer, listens to the key listener-request show at home on her radio and deduces that the same song has been played prior to each of the murders. But since the post card containing the request is posted earlier than the murders, how could the murderer be certain it would be raining on the precise day he murders? I'll continue. The story 'tells' us that the serial killer is fastidious to the point of obsessiveness in leaving clues (though some evidence is destroyed by sloppy crime scene protection). So then why would the killer write his name and address on the post card sent to the radio station? The viewer knows later on, of course, that this is because a red herring has been introduced: the person ultimately detained and tortured is not the killer! Which means that the 'smart' good cop is suddenly not so deductive an observer since he misses this. Now of course this red herring could serve to show how rotten these cops are and how the good cop is now turning into a bad cop. But if this is the plot's intent, then why in fact did song-being-played-on-each- rainy-day mean anything other than to fake the audience out? And why, for goodness sake, didn't the accused man, seriously and strenuously and believably protest his innocence from the beginning. Five or six women had been killed by this time and he knew, for he told the cops, that everyone in town knew the police were torturers. (A side bar: with no confession made public, the townspeople would still be traumatized by the potential of a serial killer loose amongst them. Under these circumstances, would two women, not together, walk into a darkening, scary and isolated woods? Classic class b horror stuff here as when a woman, alone in a house, walks down into a darkened basement!) Finally, for this particular plot problem, we get the payoff, or a payoff, at the end. The good cop turns bad and wants to kill the handcuffed man even though he has conclusive proof that the semen found on a victim wasn't his. Bad cop becomes reformed and good cop becomes corrupted. But what about the serial killer? The search for him was dropped like a hot potato and we the viewers are supposed to forget that a murderer is still out there because the film maker has made his point about good and bad cops. I also have to mention the unfortunate and unbelievable ending of this film, something that should have been left on the editor's floor. 15-or so years later the former bad cop, now a salesman, stops at the scene of the first murder. While there he meets a young school girl and when he tells her, in vague terms, that he once had some connection to the spot they're standing at, and asks her if she thinks this is 'weird', she tells him that earlier that same day another man also told her that he 'did something' there. The word 'weird' is used again and boy do I agree. Think of it folks, on the same day, thousands of days later, both the serial killer and one of the investigating cops revisit the scene of the first murder! 8 or 10 stars for 'Memories of Murder'? I think not.",

            "content": "It is quite hard for the viewer who is unfamiliar with the history of South Korea to decode what the director of this movie brilliantly depicted. I read some reviews, interpretations, and articles to help me understand Memories of Murder and so I would like to share them to help as much as I could.From the outside it is a movie about detectives who are trying to catch a serial killer who is raping beautiful women and leaving no signs behind. From the inside it is a movie that is trying to relate to the hardships of a society; the division of Korea, the occupations, the military dictatorship that ruled.. etc. It is important to note here that the movie's events were taking place in the year 86 just few years away from the military rule.The movie also communicates with the role of males that were emasculated by the horrifying events that they went through.. Watching at a time their wives turning into prostitutes for foreign soldiers and there was nothing they could do about it.. losing their jobs, their houses.. etc, are few of many examples. The male characters in the movie were not fully shown as emasculated yet they were failing and falling into anxieties.. they were wandering aimlessly.The movie was showing the failure of a system.. scandals, brutality, corruption, detectives that were like the system that they part of acting unprofessionally.. Park that is the main character was not smart and mostly behaving alongside the other young detective as if what they did had no consequences. The young detective Cho is shown in one scene attacking civilians and among them were women. The other main character that is Detective Seo is smart, cool, educated, and a good detective.. the movie simply shows us how the system with time manipulates him and how he starts to change. The characters as we could see are well built and also symbolize a greater case.The movie's name \"memories\" then is relating more to the national traumas than to the actual memories of its characters. One obvious case is discovering that the one suspected for murder came from Gwangju that saw in the year 80 a massacre executed by the military forces against a peaceful demonstration. Showing the suspect as having such a background is yet another obvious message.. the killer represents the traumas.The roles of the females that are depicted mostly as \"mothers and lovers (or whores) were criticized by many. It seems though that the director wanted to symbolize their roles to the utmost.. in showing an unbearable society, the failing role of men.. etc.One other aspect that was discussed is the movie trying to link life and death. A detective is trying to find his male subjectivity and also save lives yet keeps bumping into continuous deaths.. A killer killing but in a way searching for life in his demonstration of sexual instincts (a Freudian analysis of equaling sexual instincts with life).. Also in a sense it may be discussed that another message was that the deaths after each sexual intercourse of the killer is meant to point out the incapability of the male in that society to pertain his role (since sexuality in that matter may symbolize a demonstration of power and death demonstrating its failure).This movie is a masterpiece.. it challenged its society after all to face its history and succeeded.. the movie was a hit in Korea.",

Naturally it still depends on your perspective & taste, whether you're accustomed to watching foreign films / different cultures, and subtitles, but the cinematography (although transparent), acting, score, editing, screenplay and directing are all flawless beauty. The inclusion of historical Korean references ( protests, air raids ) are a welcome bonus for anyone interested in Asia or the Koreas, and characters that are neither 100% good nor 100% bad, is also a welcome break from American movies. Just about every character is extremely charming.You should know, however, that this is not 'Maltese Falcon', or 'Clue'; it's not a great murder mystery in the Agatha Christie / Sherlock Holmes \"who-dunnit\" sense.

Rich, fully realized, fully human characters that are sometimes very faulted, sometimes funny, sometimes surprisingly heroic. The tech credits in this movie are uniformly excellent. The cinematography and editing are as good as anything you'll see.This is a first rate investigation that has plenty of twists and turns, red herrings, drama, suspense, and humor. But what sets this apart from most is its focus on the detectives -- their foibles, weaknesses, faults, and humanity.SPOILER ALERT: The key difference between this and most serial killer movies is that the killer is never found.

The entire film felt like an expression of conscience rather than the usual film that creates falsified emotions and hogwash character development. This film was trying to express the confusion and frustration that a person feels when they border on unknown territory. The fact that this was based on a true story creates an atmosphere where the audience should stop questioning the plot, and start examining the human condition. Start to analyze what the film is trying to represent with the idea of being without fulfillment. The visceral frustration that comes out when you just don't have any answers.The cinematography is fairly standard, but it can be gorgeous at times. The characters are well developed. The acting is fine. All of the standard film criteria is met, but this film transcends the standard because of how thoroughly, and originally it examines the frustration of the unknown. I will definitely watch this again.9.7/10!!",

Blessed with a sly sardonic humor and a willingness to make fun of its characters even while evincing a great deal of affection for them, \"Memories of Murder\" plays less like a conventional cop movie and more like a regional comedy filled with rich insights into the subtle truths of human nature. The relationship between Seo, the investigator from Seoul, and Park Doo-man, the more rational of the two local officers, is intriguing and complex, as we watch them bicker and brawl and engage in petty power struggles, while slowly coming to realize that each has something of value to teach the other if only they can set aside their egos long enough to listen. Saddled with even-then antiquated technologies, Seo and Park are forced to rely on good old investigative footwork and informed intuition to try and solve the case.",

There were also plenty of twists that kept me guessing who did the deed and had such an unexpected ending it was actually refreshing and left me gobsmacked.Not sure of the rewatchability of this due to knowing whats going to happen I think (personally) would detract, but there is enough charm and detail to still have an enjoyable rewatch none the less.

Though their intentions may be good, the fact that they try and force confessions show that they don't really care much for justice and are rather more focused on the need to have someone to blame for the crimes. Kim Sang-kyung did a phenomenal job as well, and though he plays the stoic, 'masculine' cop, his expressions in the second half of the film transcends the screen.The directing and editing too are very powerful and greatly influenced the impact of the film. Bong Joon-ho does a great job with levels, atmosphere and close-ups/wide shots. His vision and direction is amazing. In addition with the great editing (music, cuts) and the mise-en-scene (and make-up of victims), this film makes for one hella creepy watch. We all know the impact that the right music choice has on a film, and especially for thriller/horror films, music is crucial to that suspense and 'jolt' moment. In this film though the music played a part by making it very reminiscent and sorrowful, like remembering a bad memory.Though it is an impressive film, it is not without it's flaws. There are a few events that are not fully explained or some scenes that are a bit confusing. Also, they never did find the killer, and there is a very high chance that he watched this and is very likely still alive now...Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",

But what this film has is a concoction of humour, satire, suspense and characterisation that places it a league above those two great films. This film isn't your average serial killer drama, it has no Noirish quality, and the look is one of beauty and nostalgia. What I think it is, is more of a social commentary and a documentation of a real life event and South Korean politics in the 1980's. The film is highly original, the cinematography has deservedly been highly praised, the acting is top notch (and I wouldn't expect any less from Korean veterans like Song Kang-ho), but what really propels this film into movie masterpiece is the quality of the characters involved. Every character evolves with the story; these are very real three dimensional characters that offer no \"police thriller\" stereotype. Miami Vice these cops are not.South Korean cinema has been consistently one of the world's best this decade and with visionary filmmakers like Park Chan Wook and Bong Joon-ho. This is one of the best films of the past decade, and it's easy to see why Quentin Tarantino agrees with that sentiment. I couldn't recommend this film highly enough. It's breathtaking.",

            "content": "Memories of Murder is such a taut, effective thriller it's a shame you have to read subtitles to gauge just how good a movie it is. The movie seems so American from afar. It's got serial killers and comic detectives and sex crimes and night chases and squabbling partners. But literally in the first sequence it establishes its uniqueness and the understated eye of its director, Joon-ho Bong, successfully managing to convert popular American plots into vehicles for caustic Korean critique.A police procedural plagued by melancholy, Memories of Murder fictionalizes a real-life incident in Korean society. It follows Korea's first serial killer case that took place in 1986 and resulted in the brutal murders and rapes of ten women. The movie begins with the body of a young girl who is tied up, raped and brutally strangled to death, being discovered in the sewers. Inspector Park Doo-man (Song Kang-ho), the local police officer in charge of the homicide, is at his wits end as he tries hard to preserve the crime scene. The murder scene however, turns into a free-for-all for the entire town and our local sloppy cop is barely able to gather any useful evidence. As soon as a second body surfaces, the nature of the crime vastly reminiscent of the first, help is sent from Seoul in the form of the sharper homicide investigator Seo Tae-yoon (Kin Sang-kyung). Over the next 2 hours, we watch as the detectives learn from each other and change under the pressures of the chase with one common goal \u2013 to bring the culprit to book. To say anything more about the storyline however, would be unfair to those who are yet to witness the brilliance of this Korean stroke of genius.Each character is brilliantly realized and all the primary and supporting characters pitch in perfectly rounded performances. Bong's masterpiece almost single-handedly resuscitates the moribund serial killer genre. Throughout the film, he fills his compositions with elements that sum up the incongruity, the sheer messiness, of life at its most banal, even in the middle of a murder investigation. Even as the body count continues to grow, Bong never allows the film to lose sight of the fact that all that withered flesh was once human.Yet even as the movie edges towards resolution, one can feel the director's reluctance to provide easy epiphanies, smug outcomes or tame answers. He's more interested in capturing a society deeply affected by the predicament of a murder investigation. What surfaces is quite extraordinary!",

I cannot find any more thrilling, meaningful than this yet.If you know about Korean history a bit, then it would be better to understand this film. The director put a number of symbols in it. The most problematic and criticized issue here is not about who is a real murderer, but about the abused powers which made lots of victims in that time.The director of Memories of Murder described every single scene and character with so much care and meanings. I could see his efforts to show all dark sides of Korean society in the 80's. He truly has extraordinary insight on Korean society and history.Korean in the 80's was very chaotic. Govertmental authority was wrongly used for every second. It was the time Korea was dictated by the notorious dictators who had military origins.. A number of people were killed during that time because they protested against the despotic government. (This is usually considered as a big metaphor for consecutive homicides which happened in the movie.) Also, it was the time that cops(helped the government to stop protests) abused innocent people in order to get fabricated confession from them. This is easily found in the movie. These are not the only problems of that time. Journalism distorted truth and made the society more disorderly. All rotten parts of the society made conflicts, mental illness, and murders.The movie itself contains the Korean history very well. How could it be more clear? Memories of Murder is based on the real case. But the director gets ahead.. He catches all the complicated and delicate social problems in the case of serial murder. So brilliant.'Memories of Murder'- it is a past tense. However, at the end of the film, the audiences would figure out that the murder is still present progressive. The movie doesn't mention clearly about the real killer. Therefore it is so confusing who is the reason of murders. Policemen? Politicians? Journalism? or Park Hyeon-gyu? Who do you think the real killer is? Memories of Murder has been more than a movie in Korea. It was one of a culture phenomenon. The characters and what they said in the film hit Korea hugely. When it was released, \"Hyangsook was pretty\" was the most popularly used sentence. In every term, Memories of Murder is surely a great film.",

So, in the meantime, we make slight deviation to see what happens in South Korean cinema, which shows us a simple story of an ordinary serial killer in an ordinary village. So true story that proves to be a true story.Evil, black, dragging innocent people, investigating murders towards itself and terrorizing the entire community for years. Slowly and methodically makes its steps, leaving the most important traces - those to itself. We can say that the film presents serious lives of the detectives who give everything they love to catch the killer. Tells about the world we live in - the public world in which any gift to possess recognition of good and bad people we have, have no chance to conclusively say who is good and who is bad. Privacy creates new limits, inaudible to everyone else. It is drama when there is no light at the end of the tunnel. The finale is the most interesting because it blurs the created image crashing it to the infinite mass of ordinary people we meet everywhere. At first as a joke, without special effects, the end catches us by the hand and leads us in our future days, which will experience knowing one truth that we saw only by its traces.I recommend only to the curious and patient ones.http://vihrenmitevmovies.blogspot.com/",

It was essentially about some murders in the rural countryside of South Korea. Two local detectives try to find the killer and are not above using torture to get a confession. However, they fail to get the right guy and a detective from Seoul is called in to help.The details of the investigation and the hunt for the suspect are laid open. The two local detectives provide the comic relief in a dark way sort of like the humour in War of the Roses. As the killings continue the calm Seoul detective begins to get frustrated and acts more like the local detectives. The ending is ambiguous and leaves things unresolved but that's more a reflection of life where loose threads are not always tied up.There is a dark mood that permeates the film through the use of dark colour schemes and a lot of night time shots. The music can be a little heavy at times. Pounding into us what we're supposed to feel rather than gently tugging on our emotions.\nOverall, I give this film an 8 out of 10. However, I'm a little biased since my heritage is Korean. Although, I don't understand the language, I know when it's being spoken and there was a familiarity with it.

At least cops could ask his father about that fact after train accident (i believe, boy could tell everything about this burns to his father for sure). Hell no, \"brilliant\" detectives wrecked up the case for a long years. And instead of asking questions, decided to beat up suspect in the end because of hysterical emotions. P.S.

It's thought-provoking, it makes you ask questions and it presents a different facade of reality that, while less optimistic, is far from not being real at all. That being said, I think ''Memories of Murder'' is close to the perfection-peak of the genre, nearly conquering it.One observation is that Bong Joon-ho certainly has a fruitful imagination but more importantly a talent in making art and quality drama out of chaos. There is a plenitude of suspense and the cops' obsession with the most puerile tracks and hints adds a certain comedic and satiric touch to the movie. A kind of dizziness is floating in the air because nothing that is undeniably true stays true for long. And even when it does, it doesn't necessarily lead to the absolute and undeniable truth as we expected. The washed-out and lacking color world the characters inhabit is not there only to suggest the atrocities that have been committed and a temporary lack of hope. The color use is a foreshadow to the hopeless ending of the investigation, compared to the more lively and colorful plain at the end of the movie when everything starts to make sense and the past is a long distance ago.A 9,5 out of 10.",

Great.\n... but if we say that our feelings are right, I think it's wrong. The sense of ethnicity around the world is different. So there is a movie, and a movie is an expo to show each other. So there is a movement to change the version according to the country being screened, but I am quite the opposite. I want to see the original at least on DVD and online. thanks.",

The movie also showed the irresponsibility of some policies that just want to close the case and play in dirty to condemn innocent people.Women were killed one by one, while there was still these policies to deal with this case, with no other policies responding to the request of support or may due to the limitation of the number of the policies. In the final scene, the hero's anger reflect people's anger that the murderer murdered many women and he may murder more while we can't do anything due to subjective or objective facts.The case wasn't close in the end ,while we can infer that the two polices may keep investigating if there is some trace of the murderer, because of their responsibility to be a policy.",

            "content": "If you are not Korean, you will not understand half of this movie. This movie is not just about a murder case. It is about the background of the time when the incident occurred.Korea has achieved rapid growth from a developing country to an advanced country in half a century. In addition, it became a democratic state through revolution from a country reigned by dictators. Overall, the film depicts Korea's poor investigation environment during the days of developing countries. In the 1980s, dictators ruled, and elite groups led by college students held anti-dictatorship demonstrations.In the middle of the film, the students practicing the presidential welcome parade(as North Korea now does), demonstrations led by university students and police suppressing them, and middle school girls moving injured in preparation for war are depicted.The torture and coercive investigations used by detective Park and detective Jo were actually abused in authoritarian society at the time. In fact, an innocent person was sentenced to prison for 20 years as the culprit of the serial murder case in Hwa-seong city, and after the real killer caught in 2019, he was sentenced to innocence again.On a rainy day, the garrisons requested by the captain were not able to stop the murder because they were dispatched to suppress the protests in Suwon City. detective Park misses the suspect because the car did not start. This implies that the dictatorship of Korea and poor technology of the time killed the innocent people at the time.Most of the college students who led the anti-dictatorship movement fell into communism. They often worked as factory workers or farmers to avoid police pursuits. The movie strongly implies that, Park, a suspect who reads lot of books with soft hands, is a college student who is being pursuit by police after participating the anti-dictatorship movement. As the police torture and forcefully investigate a murder suspect with soft hands, Koreans recall the past when police torture college students who had been demonstrating.",

The two lead characters, one a local detective who is just not intelligent enough and the other person who comes from Seoul are just magnificent and carry the movie. There are also some heart wrenching moments when one of the witnesses is crushed by a train and a rouge cop who uses his leg during investigation and then have to have his leg amputated.

Don't see much thriller like this anymore, a slow burn in a dark place with the real killer crawling in the background. There's limited police force, communication, resources back in the 80s. Pace by pace, day by day, everything's seems authentic. I'm not Korean but I assume Korean audience would praise the movie for getting a lot of facts right, right?

It wasn't bad, just disappointing.The passivity of the female characters, especially the victims, was bothersome and IMO unrealistic. Especially the last victim. After 5 rapes/murders in a small town, are you ladies still walking around alone at night? With no weapon? Really?And come on. My grandma could kick that murderer's ass. He looked about 14 years old, maybe 5'4\" 115#, and uses no weapon other than the women's clothing. Yet the final victim barely moves as she's tied up and hauled around.And don't tell me \"maybe that kid wasn't really the murderer\". It's pretty clear from the only truly scary scene- where the girl is walking to the factory and you see the head in the background pop up in the rice paddy before attacking, that it's the same guy.I get that the story was about the incompetence, corruption and brutality of the small town police, and the \"big city cop\" succumbing to his inner nature. But this trope was overplayed. You got the point when they beat up the first kid; and this movie could have been about 40 minutes shorter. OR spent that time giving us some insight into the killer's psychology. There was oddly none.The movie does have some really good scenes. Running down the \"when was masturbation a crime?\" guy at the rock mill comes to mind. The fact that it's the female cop who breaks the case was refreshing (if a little far-fetched) as well.However, if you are looking for a great Korean thriller, with a little more to say about the country's class divide, (a'la Parasite). Check out 2018's \"Burning\" directed by Lee Chang-Dong. Also a serial killer tale that takes place in a small town along the North Korean border. That film doesn't waste a minute.",

This film continues to haunt me. I have so many memories of the 'Memories of Murder'. Where do I begin? Certainly with the masterful direction of Joon-ho Bong. Rarely have I come across a film, which is in so much masterful control and savage restrain in the hands of a writer- director. It reminded me of a glorious operatic piece, orchestrated to such heightened emotional involvement and aesthetic fulfillment.It is delightfully non-Hollywood! The film functions and operates at many levels, with a larger backdrop in the national and provincial political realities of the mid-eighties South Korea. You will also encounter truly precise casting for all the characters in the film - I cannot help but laud the work of the casting director. The characters come to convincing life and such actor-character merger is indeed a rarity.The film takes itself seriously and at the same time laughs at itself, and passingly also laughs at Hollywood and the USA. Mixing layers of humour with dead serious murderous matters is such a difficult thing to achieve, and Joon-ho Bong does it with a flourish which speaks of volumes of extra-ordinary talent. Internationally, master story-teller Joon-ho Bong should be more known in the film industry than the current \"Joon-ho who?\" puzzlement. There are so many over-rated Hollywood trash directors. Its a shame.On a philosophical plane, in the 'Memories of Murder', the journey and the quest is distinctly more central and vital than the destination. The eyes are supposed to be the windows to our soul - and if I have committed a murder, my eyes will not lie.You will have memories of the 'Memories of Murder' for a long long time. Go and view it to see what great cinema is all about!",

The first half is about 2 idiotic, vicious, moronic so called policemen making a mockery of policing and procedure. They are too stupid to be funny. It's 1986 and South Korea in the sticks looks poor and primitive. No idea how true that is but it is meant to be the opposite of the Big City which has sent a real policeman, obviously meant to contrast with the yokels who follows procedure. The policewoman is more intelligent than her colleagues. Hopefully the brutality wasn't typical of the time. Only Koreans will know that. A lot of innocent people get hurt by the local police.It's a serial killer story so I don't see the point of the first half. It's too long and lacks tension. The second half turns into a real film when the frustration of not finding the killer leads to the good cop getting as bad as the bad cop. That bit works and achieves emotional sense.The reason it didn't have a conclusion is because in real life the killer wasn't caught until recently!! They have a dysfunctional Justice system as it was too long ago to convict him!!!

While at the start one is introduced as a raucous, overly confident local police officer, who has little ability to show for it, and the other a city cop with composure and patience, both are much changed by the end.In what is my favorite scene, near the end of the movie, the two policemen have a suspect cuffed and they all stand at the threshold of a dark train tunnel.\nThe city cop, whose frustration had grown with every visit to a new crime scene, is restless and with a gun drawn, ready to grasp at any sense of closure even if it means killing the wrong man. But the local officer, who himself was meant to be the undisciplined one, restrains him.The local cop then, who had claimed at the height of his false confidence of his ability to look into the suspect's eyes and just know, grabs the suspect by the chin and stares into his eyes. \"I don't know...\"With the true story, at the time of the movie's release, having no convicted suspect, they were left with no closure. We too as an audience are left devastated, having followed these men through their tireless search and having nothing in the end.An emptying experience that forces the audience, ever-deeply invested and devoted to the cause of these men, to, just as they did, move on.",

This isn't an documentation of events that happened in Hwaseong, Gyeonggi province, south Korea from 1985-1991, neither this isn't a glorification of the futile efforts of the authorities to capture the culprit. This is a folklore, an urban legend of man vs devil, that may be still heard over the gentle breeze on the far stretched paddy fields where those women got brutally raped and murdered, that chilling fear and pain the 16 year old school girl felt during her last few minutes while listening to the sound of raindrops on the leaves of tress in the forest, the scream of the detective due to frustration from faliure that still echoes in underground interrogation rooms of the police stations. This is an untold legacy of a killer , that doesn't necessarily dictates the good from the bad, neither it justifies the moral grey area. It just speaks about monstrosity within humanity that is randomly indinguishable.Director Bong Joon-Hu's second directorial venture talks about man's insignificance to the fate and destiny and that is very frustrating like real world. An thats the beauty of his craft and epic writting merit from himself and Sim Sung-bo. Officer Song Kang -ho (Park Doo-man) prioritise solving the serial killings rather than looking for the actual culprit by arresting random citizens and making them to confess something they didn't necessarily do is significantly similar to our that particular eye which we choose to shut during some unsettling situations around us untill they personly affects us. Detective Kim Sang-Kyung (Seo Tae-yoon) who comes to the village from Seoul to help solving the case prioritise capturing actual killer is metaphor of human conscience what makes people do the good in tremendously ravish circumstances which are not in favour of them. They start to act together untill the professional pride and ego comes in between them and makes them do their work in their own preferred way causing further delays demanding more innocent lives. As the number of death toll increases the frustration increases among them makes the conscience corrupt opting for result caring less about procedure and the colletaral damage.Korean movies are dark, this one is also not an exception to that. Some post mortem scens of killing scenes viewers may find highly unsettling not because of the graphical gore but because of the portrayal of the torment the victims suffered. The comedic relief in between moments to subsidise the frustration of getting hope and more despair also works fine to not make the ambience overly serious than it needs to be like cliched serial killer movies. The final scene where the little girl says that the killer looks \"normal\" shatters and redefines every definition of normal and the facial expression of detective Song as answer to that makes the \"hope\" main villain in the story which creates more devastating effects to the man's soul than despair. Acting wise the movie is a treat to watch.Another important aspect is the back ground music which is created by Taro Iwashiro is so distinctive, different from the generic classic thematic musical approach to the specific genre making it a wholesome experience.Undoubtedly this movie is an all time best movie world has ever seen that is so much more than an audience can hope for creating ab ever lasting effect on the viewers, and that's the legacy of it. This movie should be treated as an case study of elevation of genre standards which is pretty rare.",

            "content": "This has to be my most re-watched film in the last five years. Memories of Murder is an incredibly impressive second movie from the now internationally very well known Bong Joon-ho.The film is loosely based on the true case of the first serial killer in South Korea. Usually I find difficulty watching crime films or shows based on actual events, particularly if they show a great deal of the actual crimes. For example, I had to stop watching the recent Dahmer show. Something just felt icky about how intimately it displayed events.Memories of Murder focuses more on the characters, how the case shifts their motivations and attitudes towards their work, and the effects of mismanaged justice. These people are at times funny, spiritual, irresponsible, empathetic and cruel.We see the small moments in-between important plot beats for the case. Talking to their partners, dinners out at a cozy restaurant, fighting protestors as the fifth republic of Korea falls apart around them; a brilliant shot lingers on the final stages of a wild karaoke night.Speaking of visuals, the character ensemble framing is outstanding here. So many shots with the whole main cast in them is very refreshing.The mundane locations help the film stay grounded, and the way the camera controls the viewers' eyesight is masterful. The shots have a lot of info in them, but we are drawn to motion, or characters' eyesight.All of this is accompanied by a brilliantly melancholic score by Taro Iwashiro. The ending song I have listened to more times than I would care to admit.So back when I decided to go through Bong Joon-ho's filmography by release order, I did not expect his second film to be as excellent as it was. I especially didn't expect a development in the actual case to happen two days after I watched it (September 16th, 2019 was my first viewing). I will refrain from saying what exactly happened, but I do implore people to watch the film first, then research afterwards.This is a wonderful, atmospheric, funny, tragic, well-made film, and at the moment, one of my favourites of all-time.",

            "review_title": "Overrated, doesn't follow it's own rules",
            "content": "As some other reviewers have pointed out, a significant portion of this film is basically a comedy, including comedic stooges-esque slapstick juxtaposed with a murder-rape victim's corpse in near-proximity. It doesn't fit with the film, is arguably in poor taste, and at times was just downright silly.The comic detective versus the serious detective plays out well enough. But then they reverse roles in the climactic scene for apparently no reason. The serious cop was adamant about the reliability of documents, but then he suddenly says \"I have no need for this document\" when it didn't fit his narrative. But they had established him as someone who was attentive to the facts. Why did he suddenly become a completely psychotic emotional wreck in the climax? \\(\u00b0_o)/. Supposedly seeing a victim he knew personally triggered him, but that was alien to his establishment as a level-headed character who would not have wanted to seek revenge on someone that documented DNA evidence cleared of guilt. There was no explanation or buildup as to why the comic and serious detectives switch personalities. Only the comedic guy was prone to manipulating the solving of a case for his own glory. Earlier in the film, the serious guy explicitly avoids such motives, and yet does a 180.Then, as others have pointed out, there were the inconsistencies in the murder profiles. At first it was single women wearing red in the rain. Then rain became optional. Then it even included a child. There was one scene where they interrogate a girl who wasn't killed, and she claimed it was because she didn't look at the guy's face. Was that accurate? \\(\u00b0_o)/. All we know is he didn't kill her for some reason, which was another anomaly in the profile. By the end of the film, the killer was including mutilations and random objects in his killings that are never built out. There is never a coherent profile of the killer.Again, as others have pointed out, one of the key \"clues\" was a completely random deus ex machina where a side cop randomly noticed the same song on the radio exactly on the nights that 3 of the murders took place. This is never explained. One of the suspects admits to placing the song requests, but there is never any explanation of why that guy - who is later vindicated by DNA - made those song requests at those times. During an interrogation of that same suspect, the detective starts counting the number of peach pieces at the crime scene, and this clearly upsets the suspect, who starts screaming to shut up. So why would he be so emotional by that description of the crime scene? That suspect was cleared by DNA. Are we supposed to believe the DNA was wrong? If so, there was no indication given that it was. And if the DNA was accurate, there was no logical reason for an otherwise staid suspect to freak out suddenly at a detective counting peaches - other than to try to trick or confuse the viewer with random character behaviors, which is just lame writing.In the film's postscript that takes place in 2003, the comedic guy decides to visit the first crime scene which is in the middle of a gigantic empty field. He ducks down to look at where the body is and when he pops back up again, wouldn't you know there happens to be a young girl there by herself *in the middle of the gigantic empty field* who tells him she recently talked to a guy looking at the same spot and this guy looked \"ordinary\" and comedic guy ends the film breaking the 4th wall. This is supposed to be some profound end to a masterpiece? Another deus ex machina of encountering this girl - who also encountered the killer - who himself apparently visited that spot recently - in the middle of a cornfield twenty years later? Seriously? And he looks ordinary so the detective looks into the camera, cuz it could be anyone. That's not profound. That's what follows a film with no coherent puzzle to solve.The clues don't add up. The killer has no consistent MO. The detectives have inconsistent personalities. Nothing fits together nicely.From a cinematic and acting perspective, the film is solid. It doesn't follow the predictable \"Disney\" protagonist rise-fall-redemption arc, so that's a plus of any film anymore. None of that is enough to give this a favorable score.",

For me the average rating of this film on here at 8.1/10 is ridiculously high, I even see a review on here calling this the best crime/detective film ever. I'm not sure if the author of that review either wants to be edgy or hasn't seen many detective films. In my opinion Se7en is the best detective film ever made.Back to this film. The tone shifts mid scene were really jarring. There would be wacky slapstick violence during dramatic scenes that didn't do it for me.For the most part the performances were quite good and the character arcs of the detectives felt deserved and justified. I thought the third act was a bit rushed but I liked the last scene, especially when I later found out that the film was based on true events giving a little more context to the final scene.As I said I liked this film and i'm not hating but if you've rated this 10/10 ask yourself. If this was based in a small town in Texas with an American Cast would this have an average rating higher than 6.7/10. Again i'm not hating as a lot of my favourite films are foreign but sometimes there's a bit of snobbery in the ratings of foreign films on here.",

If there is a Sherlock Holmes in reality and sees this movie, he would be plucking his hairs for the way police investigated the case. The movie just illuminate the pathetic investigation all through the story. But then again the story was real and you don't wonder why the serial rapist/killer is not caught at all. If there was a studious investigator in reality, he would have finished the case a long ago with his meticulous scientific inquiry. Nevertheless, I really recommend the movie for how the depict the reality of investigation and how they approach the criminals.

            "content": "There's a quiet sense of hysteria present throughout Joon-ho Bong's Memories of Murder. Though on the surface the movie plays as a detective with many comedic elements, its true core consists mostly of deep despair and paranoia. It is a testament to the director's skill that these two sides are joined together so well without it resulting in a disjointed mess.Memories of Murder portrays a case of a serial rapist in a small town on the outskirts of the Korean countryside. Three detectives with very different methods of investigation are put together to search for the killer. It becomes quickly clear that this isn't a usual case and the complexity of the case puts the detectives way over their head. You get the sense that these are effective investigators in their own right, but they are way outmatched for the situation they are put up against.Part of the effectiveness of the film is that it actually conveys the overwhelming fear that slowly seeps into the persons facing the unknown evil. The horrific acts committed are all the more scary because they are happening in a town with seemingly nice people. Everyone in the town seems to know each other by name. This makes the killer seem like somewhat of an alien presence, a ghost hiding behind a human face. As the girl describes the presumed killer in the end, his appearance was that of just an \"ordinary\" guy. The most scary thing is that he isn't a hideous deformed creature driven to these disturbing acts, but that this person could ostensibly be hiding in each other person that you know, with no way to determine which one in particular.Because there seems to be no rhyme and reason to what is happening the movie makes for a very scary experience. I have to admit I am not an avid watched of foreign films, but at the same time I found this movie to be thrilling to watch. It is not a light experience (it will likely leave you drained at the end) but very worth seeing. Highly recommended.",

Just as \"Oldboy\" is arguably categorized as Park's masterpiece, \"Memories of Murder\" is the film which established Bong Joon-Ho as being a visionary on his own right.The film, as the title suggests, is based on a murder being investigated by two detectives; Park Doo-Man (Kang Ho Song) and Cho Yong-Koo (Ro-ha Kim). Due to the publicity that the killings are getting in their area, Seoul decides to send Detective Seo Tae-Yoon who will help the current detectives with their case. This film, however, is not your conventional detective drama. This is an exercise on \"Who-Dunnit\" films which even the master Alfred Hitchcock would be proud of. The heart of the story, unlike the films from it's genre, is not in in it's mystery, but in it's exploration of the protagonists and the motives and reasons which drove hem through the case. Throughout the film we will also explore into the nationalistic and social environments that these characters had to come through to stay focused on the task that mattered the most; solving this case.The film is a little more than 150 minutes in length and is engrossing for that whole period. This is hard to find in mystery films but it achieved this not only through the master story-telling of Bong Joon-Ho, but due to the absolute mesmerizing performances given by Kang Ho-Song, Sang-Kyung Kim and Roe-ha Kim. The three detectives complemented each other with sublime chemistry but the star of the show was Kang-Ho Song. Song is established as one of the most accomplished actors to come out of Korea and this film, along with J.S.A., helped him to establish a reputation which is as strong today as it was then. The film is the only time when the characters were not defined by the story or vice-versa, but they perfectly complemented each other due to the skill that both the film-maker and the actors had in both their trades. Bong Joon-Ho is not as stylish as Park Chan-Wook is or as outrageous in his art as Kim-Jee Won is, but his vision helped give birth to another kind of film-maker from Korea who focused on simplicity a lot more than his counterparts to bring forth a complicated vision. This film was one of the first ones to promote this vision and to this day it stands as a film which defines this extremely different visionary who emerged out of this small but culturally rich nation.",

The good thing about the movie is it's feels like different movie until the end. The bad thing about the movie is it is trying to be movie like M1931 but without the solving case.\nThanks.",

I was excited when I saw it was the same Director as Parasite as I thought that film was true perfection in many ways... Whereas I found Memories of Murder nonsensical. I understand that solving violent crimes in Korea in the 80's was probably as much of a disaster as portrayed in the film, but certain scenes were reminiscent of Telenovela acting and it was difficult to keep my focus despite needing to read subtitles. The film is worth a watch for the story line alone, but the acting is what will keep me from watching it a second time.",

But I choose this Memories of Murder first instead of watching that one directly. Maybe some kinds of preparation I think. And now, I can't wait for watching the next coming Korean movies.This crime movie tells a simple story, officers finding the criminals. But the director has combined so many 1980s Korean countryside scenes within it, and makes everything vivid. The actors also made a perfect performance of a simple countryside policeman. There are no cool-handsome guy with clean suits, no exciting gunfire and car crash, and no beauties with sexy body line, like other main Shows did. There just have the cold rain, dangerous country road, and animal covered with man's skin.And of cause, justice didn't win.",

The movie surely is interestingly shot, however nothing makes it groundbreaking in any way. The plot is thrilling but inconclusive. The chase is interesting but no cat & mouse play is at stake since we've never ever came close to the killer.

The chaos that ensues and the fear psychosis which grips the community can only be assuaged once the killer is caught. And this can sometime lead to botched up investigations and over zealous attitude and brutal methods being adopted. The \"Good Cop Bad Cop\" routines, Confessions being forced all leading to it becoming a sham.\nThe way the story is built up and details of the murders.. the surroundings....the rain...the \"Sad Letter\" song... the method of brutal rapes and murders... all instill a sense of fear for the personality of the murderer. He does not use any sophisticated weapons.... rather the victim's possessions only to do his job but carefully selects them.\nAnd our detectives hard pressed to find him go overboard many times but he just keeps giving them the slip... and even when they think they have him there aint enough evidence... the frustration and despondency even forces a do right cop to flip into a violent one.\nFor me the concluding scene is the best where Sang Kang Ho sits near the scene of first crime and contemplates what could have been...\nYes.. a few scenes could have been done away with but they are like invisible blips on the canvas...\nSuperb!!!",

The movie is powerful from the very first scene and you soon realise this will be one of those \"beautiful\" movies that stay with you for awhile. The music is spectacular,the scenery is warm, the characters grow on you, but on the same note, the movie stays on firm ground, giving you a sense of seriousness and realism.

Initially, the ending felt unsatisfactory to me and I was so tired I slept after finishing it.Thinking about it now, it does seem that this movie is a great thriller worth watching, with extraordinary camera shots, such as the world famous foggy field scene, the introduction of the main detective, and the overall gloomy and dark colour grading. While the movie did start out slow, it was not the way it ended, while also getting sidetracked into some dark humour and casual violence.But the storyline, the emotions, the initial acute airheadedness of the main detective, while also his development, are what I remember the most from this movie. Particularly the last 10 minutes when detective Seo realises the girl he met and helped was raped and murdered. How he began to lose his mind with anger and rage, and how detective Park, now mature and sensible, pulled him back from the edge while the same Park at the beginning of the movie, would have let Seo blow the guy's brains out. It was pure raw emotion.For me, this wasn't a masterpiece, but it stood out from the other thrillers I've watched till now. Yet who knows? Maybe it'll become a masterpiece for me too if I spend enough time with it.",

We can see from Park's facial expression how frustrated and regretful he was for not being able to catch the bad guy and especially after learning from the little girl that the guy he had been chasing all this time was in fact just an ordinary looking person, as opposed to some weird, bald, monstrous looking guy that he had had in his mind throughout the investigation.He later looked into the camera with his \"look me in the eye\" face, knowing that the rapist was still out there and hoping that he would be watching this and felt a little bit of guilt. The movie then fades away with a haunting and despairing music, a perfect accompaniment to the regretful detectives for not being able to solve the case, to the desperate audience for not seeing the actual bad guy, and to the rapist himself for the gruesome crime that he has to live for the rest of his lives.10/10.",

The performances of everybody are really great, however the atmosphere of the film, is what worked the best for me personally. The movie starts a bit slow for me personally, but when you get in the 2nd and especially 3rd act, the movie shines.

            "content": "\"Paper doesn't lie.\"\n\nA tense and engaging investigational thriller that employs plenty of the film design that Bong Joon-Ho has become renowned for - subtext regarding political and social satire interwoven with creative narratives that have enough strength to stand on their own legs. The plot, ostensibly about coming to understand the psyche of an unprecedented killer, really revolves around two key facets, the changing social landscape of South Korea (particularly the political instability that factors into bureacratic ineptitude embodied by Song Kang-ho's Park Doo-man, and the self-defeating strongman tactics employed by his junior, Cho Yong-koo) and a more universal human frailty. While the former investigators rely on their familiarity with local customs and even traditional superstition where their wits fail them, Kim Sang-kyung's Seo Tae-yoon is the more urban, procedural investigator embodying a new way of thinking. Together there is an overlapping goal (catching the killer), but plenty of friction caused by the disparity in their approaches and a surprising amount of humor in the contrast between them in spite of the seriousness of their roles.\n\nUltimately an exercise showcasing the inability of completely rectifying contrasting lifestyles (Park and Seo gradually form a collaborative effort, but are unsuccesful in catching the killer; a 'coming together to save the day' ending would have seemed cheap), Memories of Murder paints an uncertain portrait for the future of a socially divided South Korea filled with people who are imperfect by nature, but also is one particularly taut crime thriller. There's little in the way of audience omnipotence, except a few scattered moments to keep the tension high. The framing, cinematography, and color design all seem way ahead of their time for 2003; this film could easily be released today. The performances are solid, the direction is taut, and the characters/character development are excellent. And what an ending shot, with Song Kang-ho directing his 'eye contact' method to the audience. \n\nDefinitely an influence on Zodiac, but miles better in my opinion. Where Fincher skews towards the true-to-life elements to give the audience a chill and a sense of mystery, Bong Joon-ho clearly has loftier ambitions. (4.5/5)",

This film has painfully flawed characters (who you're rooting for), depressing subject matter, edge-of-your-seat action, and is beautifully shot. The first interrogation scene grabbed my attention; the \"murder reenactment\" scene made me realize that I was watching something special. The character development of Park (Song Kang-ho) and Seo (Kim Sang-kyung) culminates in a penultimate scene that catches your breath in your throat. We catch a glimpse of the killer \u2014 in a blurry, frightening moment \u2014 but not enough to identify him. The suspect carousel, the puzzle-piece clues, the fear and distrust fomenting in the provincial town create the tension on which the plot thrives. The story is based on a series of real murders in Korea that have been compared to the \"Zodiac Killer\" in America. In 2003, the murders had not yet been solved, so the ending is powerful and makes sense. However, in only the past few years, that has changed. Memories of Murder is a fantastic movie and has at least three jump-kicks. Hellz yeah.",

What stood out to me this time was the compositions and beautiful shots, the foggy wheat fields, rain drizzling down muddy streets, lights glowing and bouncing off the wet grass it\u2019s beautifully dark and gritty with an ominous atmosphere. Bong has a lot to say about the very masculine, totalitarian threat looming over us. Democracy isn\u2019t always permanent and a past with this many systemic issues as can be a very real future. I read that he watched Cure repeatedly while writing this and you can see the influence. In that film there\u2019s much more emphasis on the psyche and digging deep into each of our darkest desires, how easily those can be twisted into gruesome acts of violence given a little pressure. In Memories of Murder, there\u2019s a different but similar kind of digging. Less of our darkest, suppressed societal desires but the fact those desires exist and are manifested in a setting where murders like this were never expected to happen. How dismantling and confusing the thought of an evil you never imagined existed affects your mind. How the simplest looking of people can do the most grotesque things. The arrogance that this idea was never considered, or taken seriously and had the impact it did, is, in my opinion, what the film is built on. The police don't expect the killer to be a simple man, yet he is (on the outside), and that\u2019s the scariest thing he could\u2019ve been. One of my all time favorites, thank you Bongster for this banger. Cannot wait for whatever he does next. ",

Furthermore, the detective from Seoul wasn't as professional nor as intelligent as I expected, although his actions towards the end made sense and allowed for a brilliant scene. It would have been nice to have more background on him considering there was some backstory to the original investigator and then a slight focus on his pal. Aside from that and the perhaps overly comedic tone in places, it seemed to correspond to the actual events well, and the actor for the perpetrator even looked like the real person, despite the case still being unsolved when the film was made. They nailed the perpetrator's behaviour, the ending was excellent, and it will certainly be a film I remember. The pacing was reasonable besides the dragging police corruption, the acting was solid, plenty happened, the action was a mixture of enjoyable, comedic, and tragic, the cinematography and visual effects held up and made Korea look beautiful despite the events, the production design was believable, and the soundtrack was catchy and emotional.",

Bong Joon-ho managed to extract some of the most genuine acting I've seen to where I wouldn't blame you if you thought this was real. Everyone in the film, despite being just a set of characters, felt like a very real person, and in a sense, they might as well be, as the film was based on a real set of investigations. The scenes of abuse are just as shocking as was necessary, and help to drive home Bong Joon-Ho's point about the Republic of Korea's justice system (at least during 1986-1991). The music really suits each of the scenes well, and I could just go on and on. Ultimately, though, I was blown away by this movie, and I can not help but give it a perfect 5 stars out of 5.

The themes are serious but it doesn't seem to take itself too serious, lending itself to a more lighthearted feel. I love how Bong nailed the whole 80's fashion and look throughout the movie. Man, Bong really knows how to setup a beautiful shot. This movie's a dark comedy. \n\nWow, so they're trying to convict an innocent retarded kid as the murderer just so they can say that they solved the case, so they can move on? That's so corrupt and crooked. So funny when they bought the kid NICE sneakers instead of NIKE. Jesus, wtf is going on during that time in 1986? There's like military presence on the streets? Is that why these cops are able to do what they do? Drop kicking suspects and acting ruthlessly reckless. How darkly ironic that the detective that tortures suspects with his military boots, now has to have his right leg amputated. The same one who would cover up his right boot with a sleeve to not leave and scratches when he was curb stomping people on the floor. That's karmic justice right there lol. \n\nI like the detective from Seoul's character. He seems like he's out for justice and wants to see things through the right way. I think it was Park who committed the crimes. He was the only one who retaliated out of all the suspects. I mean he had a gun pointed at his face and he took a rock and slashed the inspector's hand! If that were any other innocent suspect, they would have cowered in fear, plead for their life. And just the way he looked like he enjoyed saying that he did the murders is a telling sign. The document at the end saying that there's no DNA proof that it was Park is just Bong's way of saying how incompetent, unhelpful and unreliable America can be when helping other countries. \n\nBong uses subtlety and creepiness in a very effective way by either blurring something in the background or by building tension. Works as a very offbeat and quirky comedy at times, definitely has its own style going on. I will say Bong Joon-Ho definitely has a great sense of humor. I didn't find the color of the movie that pleasing. It has like a greenish grayish tone that makes everything seem more somber, almost artificial in a way. There's some clever social commentary and satire going on here with military and police power. I feel like I need to rewatch this movie again at some point.",

            "content": "Haunting portrayal of the atrocities committed by South Korea's Zodiac Killer.\n\nBong Joon-ho's South Korean crime drama and murder mystery Memories of Murder (2003) is a fascinating, informative, and disturbing depiction of the 1986-1991 serial killings commited in Hwaseong, Gyeonggi Province. It's startling as it documents the intense and insane homicide detective investigation that was undertaken over years to identify Korea's first documented serial killer. You see enough to disturb your mind and infer what has happened. The film leaves you changed with a sense of the apathetic cruelty that humanity is capable of, yet the decency of good people trying to do their jobs balancing out the evil violence.\n\nI should mention that it's a disgusting case, finally concluded all these years later as the real killer finally confessed in 2019, which Bong obviously didn't know about as the film released in 2003, but it adds a layer of satisfaction knowing that he has been caught. I think Memories of Murder is one of the greatest pictures I've ever seen, one of South Korea's best films, and a peerless crime drama. Only The Silence of the Lambs, Se7en, Cure, or Zodiac can truly compare in craftsmanship and chills. Memories of Murder is in a class all its own for its raw realism and sleek direction.\n\nBong Joon-ho's direction is riveting as he details the entire police investigation in shocking true crime with heavy rainfall, long takes, and creepy atmosphere everywhere. Director Bong uses the cover of nightfall, shadows, dark paths, and eerie forestry to unnerve the viewer as the grisly details are unveiled. It's shocking to see any crime of this grotesque and cruel nature, let along hearing someone speak the facts right to you. Bong builds the detective's case with facts, suspects, time, evidence, motive, and connects the dots between the killings so that we can easily draw the same conclusions as Korea's law enforcement at the time.\n\nFurthermore, Bong contributes his own added absurdist sense of humor as there's plenty to laugh at to lighten the mood of this seriously horrifying case. I was surprised at how funny Memories of Murder starts out as these detectives tried anything and everything from torture to shamans to figure out who the killer was, but it evolves into an astonishing display of enthralling deduction and reasoning alongside brutal killings. \n\nSong Kang-ho is hilarious as the immoral and insane cop with a ruthless attitude Detective Park Doo-man. You see the Korean government's brutal and outdated tactics with his character, especially with his countryside cop methods. Song Kang-ho is perfect here as he also displays his dramatic prowess towards the end as he gets more seriously involved in the case. Likewise, Kim Sang-kyung is excellent as Seoul Detective Seo Tae-yoon with his big city methodology and cool seriousness. You understand that Detectives Park and Seo needed to work together with their combined unorthodox and by the book, respectively, techniques. They are incredible leading actors in Memories of Murder, especially once the camera is right up on their eyes.\n\nKim Roe-ha's erratic and violence police officer is both fun and shocking as he tortures suspects in interrogation for false confessions and worthless testimony as Detective Cho Yong-koo. Song Jae-ho is funny and bears a strong presence as Sergeant Shin Dong-chul with his gravitas and experience. I liked Park No-shik's funny performance as the mentally challenged witness Baek Kwang-ho. I must mention the cold and captivating performance from Park Hae-il as serial killer suspect Park Hyeon-gyu. I should say that Go Seo-hee is beautiful and compelling as Officer Kwon Kwi-ok. Jeon Mi-seon is lovely and captivating as the endearing Kwok Seol-yung, similarly.\n\nWriters Bong Joon-ho, Kim Kwang-rim, and Shim Sung-bo find the humanity of these detectives getting pushed into the dark oblivion of hopelessness from optimistic beginnings. It's terrifying to watch them unravel. Bong Joon-ho amazed me with his delightful satire Parasite, but Memories of Murder remains his finest masterclass of refined direction and his greatest picture.\n\nKim Sun-min's editing keeps you absorbed by the mystery with quickly developing clues and sharp cuts from detectives to the murder's perspective for an all encompassing 131 minutes of mayhem. Kim Hyung-koo's cinematography is breathtaking with ultra wide shots of the paddy fields hiding a killer to the serial killer lurking up in the shadows of a treetop. Everything is on screen for you to see and enjoy. Ryu Seong-hie's production design impressively recreates 1986 Korea, while Yang Hong-sam's set decoration looks all gritty and grungy for the furnishings.\n\nTaro Iwashiro's score is beautiful with an ever increasing sense of dread to his composition. Kim Yoo-seon's costumes have a natural look with a cute fashion sense that comes across as fun for such a dreary picture. Jong Ik Kang comes up with all manner of striking visual effects for gunshots and needle injections.\n\nIn conclusion, there's depraved humanity and then there's humanity's aptitude for creating beautiful art like Bong Joon-ho's Memories of Murder.",

Through the film you understand how bad is the Korean detectives and you imagine how they even got the job in the first place. The first half of the film(if you cut the rape and murder) you can be really interpret it for a comedy but the second half is when it get serious. I didn't mind the comedy and made it seems more natural I was kinda bored with the American type production crime movies who they are 100% drama. I recommend this film 100% if u have not seen it already you are missing big time. P.S I had to google what the ending was  trying to say(maybe I am stupid(i am not)).",

            "content": "One of Bong Joon-Ho's first big hits is now available for rent on Amazon Prime! The film, based on a true crime story that was not solved at the time of the film's original release, is about the efforts of some local detectives to find a serial killer. Two detectives from a local police department, one of who has anger control issues, and the other who seems to have gotten his training from crime detective television shows, are joined by an educated detective from Seoul. The first half of the film is very funny watching Detective Park conjure all of his worst and amateur sleuthing skills, even visiting a psychic, to make headway in the crime. As typical with Joon-Ho's films, his stories linger along the cultural boundaries, and in this case, he finds humor in the contrast in investigating styles between the three detectives. There are shifts in mood that are also characteristic of his films. You find yourself laughing and then suddenly realize something horribly serious is happening. And, like Parasite, the noticeable divisions between the characters blur as the story continues and the murder investigation leads nowhere. This is a well-crafted crime story that is beautifully shot and wonderfully acted. While I don't know a lot about Korean history, it was interesting to watch these events unfold in a culture that seemed to not have any experience with serial killers and where the police didn't have time to dedicate resources to fighting the crime because they were out covering demonstrations and focusing on \"other priorities\". I loved this film, which gets a huge thumbs up from me. It is excellent entertainment and is one of my favorite films of his.",

With \"Memories of Murder\", we receive his classic 2003 serial murder mystery, which in spite of being only his second feature, is a strong rival for his best work. Though compared favourably to David Fincher's excellent \"Zodiac\", this cracker Korean film came four years prior.\n\nBased on real life events that gripped South Korea back in the late eighties, this riveting thriller delivers Bong's clever filmmaking touches, mixing pull no punches drama with deft comedic bits to create a rich viewing experience. Whether the small village cops slapsticking and bungling a gruesome crime scene, or brutally extorting confessions from the innocent, they do so in a flowing, organic rhythm of tone shifts that is key to the movie going experience.\n\nParasite star Song Kang-ho is excellent as the rowdy, cocksure detective who claims to reveal criminals by looking deep into their eyes. He is the perfect blend of boisterous, naive, silly, gung ho and empathetic. As with most Bong projects, such sublime character development is crucial to the plot.\n\nThe less said about the storyline the better (and the real story has some interesting recent revelations). Best left to discover that on your own. \"Memories of Murder\" defies the \"early effort\" tagline. It is a fully developed, beautifully shot, perfectly paced, and gripping film, from start to finish. A shadowy thinker, it ranks right up there with \"Parasite\", tackling political, personal and societal themes in the guise of a simple story, in what is now a considerable Bong cannon, and is a much welcome discovery.\n\n- hipCRANK",

            "content": "Following his international success with Parasite, director Bong Joon-Ho's second feature is re-released in post-lockdown cinemas that's starving for content. Had I seen this back in 2003 when it was first released, I would've concluded that this film, based on the true story of a serial rapist-murderer in a rural Korean town in 1986, ticks so many boxes we associate with Nordic noirs, we could've called it Kimchi noir. Rice paddy fields replace snow-covered landscapes as the menacing backdrop where a mismatched cop duo, one temperamental and prone to bend rules to get results and the other more subdued and contemplative, investigate a series of gruesomely portrayed murders which always take place on sad rainy days. It is a beautifully shot crime drama that's ultimately less about the crime and more about the obsessive detectives and how the case affects them. While I'm not sure if one can track any early signs of greatness here that point to Bong's eventual breakthrough as a future Oscar winner, there is no doubt a strong sense of composition and visual flair at work here, especially in his framing and use of close-ups; while a dark sense of humour permeates his writing, including a wicked sense of justice which in this film manifests in one of the detective's recurring use of a flying kick against (normally innocent) suspects and the fate of his leg in the final act. Though I was initially irritated by the film's more slapstick comedic tone towards Song Kang-ho's Detective Park's incompetence and dubious judgements, that surprisingly ends up making his character almost understandable, if not redemptive even by the final act. Hindsight is a wonderful thing but there's no denying that this is a solid and promising effort from a young director whose elegant storytelling abilities will take him far.",

It's no different with this film.  At it's core it's a detective thriller about an anonymous serial killer and rapist who prays on young women.  Pretty basic stuff.  However, the trick of this movie is that the majority of it is spent trying to identify who the killer is, and by the end, our main characters never find out.  Much like David Fincher's 'Zodiac', by the end of the film, the protagonist is staring at someone.  However, here he's staring not at one individual, but at us, the audience.  Prior to this final shot, the protagonist is told by a little girl that, presumably the killer, is someone rather plain and ordinary looking.  Does this imply that monsters like this walk among us and we don't even know it?  Is that what the movie is trying to convey in this final shot?  I believe so.",

The subject matter is serious and dark, so I thought this could be a gritty detective drama. I always enjoy a murder mystery and a police procedural, so that aspect of the film had me excited. However, at the same time that there was all this heavy stuff happening, there were a few characters bumbling around almost as incompetent as the Keystone Cops. The way these small-town cops treat a serial killer case is so ridiculous it bordered on farce, and I couldn\u2019t tell if I was supposed to be laughing. It\u2019s a tough balancing act to pull off a movie that is both dramatic and comical, and I\u2019m not sure they did the best job finding the balance. However, there were times when it worked and the contrast did a great job of making the comedy even more humorous. The case that is the focus of this story is one that creates some great scenes loaded with tension. I love how they slowly piece together the M.O. of the killer and that creates a framework for us to recognize imminent danger. This makes later scenes even more frightening because we know what is coming. I enjoyed seeing the unique aspects of an investigation in Korea, and some of the struggles that they experience. It\u2019s easy to get accustomed to the style of American police work (or at least the kind we see portrayed on TV and in the movies,) but these characters have challenges that we don\u2019t anticipate when they have to look into a case like this one. The other thing that made this film more powerful was the visual style. Bong Joon-ho captures some amazing visuals that will stick in my mind for a long time, and uses them in order to add to dark aesthetic of the story. What makes Memories of Murder more than just a simple procedural is the relationship dynamics between the lead characters. Song Kang-ho plays the small town detective who has his way of doing things that is misguided, but apparently has worked for him in the past. Kim Sang-kyung plays the newcomer from the big city who wants a more structured investigation by the book. You can see from the start that these two are going to butt heads over how to solve the case, and it becomes one of the main points of conflict in the film. I only wish we were allowed to see more merit in the method from Song Kang-ho\u2019s character, because he is so obviously in the wrong the whole time he becomes more of an annoyance instead of a quirky positive presence. I still got deeply involved in the mystery and was riveted most of the way through Memories of Murder. While it wasn\u2019t a perfectly executed thriller or a perfectly executed comedy, it had enough good qualities from both genres to keep me engaged.",

But our Republic of Korea, using just your two legs you can run all over it. So it's said, Korean detectives investigate with their feet. That's folk wisdom, you bastard.

This is by far the best foreign film I have ever seen, and honestly one of the best serial killer movies too; up there with 'Zodiac' and 'Se7en'. I'm not even sure where to begin: so I'll start by saying that I'm having trouble finding anything I didn't like. Director Bong Joon-ho has proved himself a master filmmaker with this movie - from the way he stages a scene, to the way he moves the camera, to the sheer attention to detail displayed in every moment. He also manages to get some terrific performances out of his cast, and it was genius to see how the two main detectives, played perfectly by Song Kang-Ho and Kim Sang-kyung, were so different throughout the whole movie - yet with a crime like this, appeared exactly the same at the end. There's not much else I can say, but I implore you to seek this Korean masterpiece out. I was hooked from the very beginning, and the end was masterful in the way it was one of the most disturbing parts of the film, that at the same time didn't involve anything grotesque. In my opinion, a flawless masterpiece.",

It's a movie without any ending and the one that attaches a hook to you brain and won't let it go. From the publicity posters to the editing, writing and acting this movie is a thoughtful work.\nAt times it would seem like reading an old novel and at times it would seem like watching a nemesis film. There are many flavors which work because of the terrific acting jobs everyone has done. Every character is a perfect fit. Both of the lead cops are opposite to each other and then the shift in their personality to take each other's place. The suspense is very strongly kept through out the movie and there is a ground breaking background score to lift it to new heights. The chase seen from the woods into the village and then the factory site is very thrilling. Another scene involving the train accident is also placed right.\nThere would not be any department or field this movie could be less then great at.\nKang-ho Song, is the best thing in the movie. His portrayal of an aggressive cop is top notch. He brings all the humor and then the intensity in the movie. Sang-kyung Kim, also gave wonderful performance. A cop with less known background which is civilized and honest to his job and then loses his control over the event. \nA movie which will be on your favorite lift forever.",

            "content": "Okay, I'll preface this by saying that South Korea is a master of cinema; the whole Korean cinematic industry has made a fantastic job in showing the world what filmmaking is all about.\n\nThis movie is a prime example of that.\n\nSarinui chueok, or Memories of Murder for the rest of the world, is not just a police-procedural movie, okay? It's not your typical murder-mystery thriller. This movie is all about characters, human characters, all-too human. This movie will show you, in a superb manner, the complexity of the human being.\n\nThat's what makes this movie so complex: it deals with the nature of human beings against something they do not understand, it takes characters to places where they'll lose their minds; it will strip its characters from their pragmatic ego's, from their self-centered personas. It will show humans at the turn of their most obscure side. It will show you what happens when humans step into the Dark Side of the Moon.\n\nHow? Well, the answer is simple. Take a South Korean lazy-corrupt officer (detective Park) along his even more lazy-corrupt-and-aggressive partner (detective Cho) to investigate the most hideous serial killer of that time (1980s) in a very small town. Let them show you their sleazy ways. Let them show you their incompetence when it comes to work, serious work that is: you're investigating a series of murders! \n\nThese men will torture suspects just for the simple reason that \"they heard he committed the murders\", that's how bad they can be. \n\nLet's take it even further, just to show how far their corruptness can go: they will plant evidence just so they can convict a suspect of a crime, even if that suspect is mentally disabled.\n\nThese two guys are just a complete mess when it comes to working. However they think their crooked ways are the right ones. Detective Park usually says: \"I can simply look at a man's eyes and find out if he's guilty or no\", that's he's way of thinking, you get the idea now?\n\nSo we have two incompetent-corrupt officers of the law. Now bring an outsider (detective Seo), an officer straight from the capital and a serious man about his work - because they investigate murders, it has to be very serious work. This man will show them his pragmatic ways of working: \"documents never lie\" he would normally say when referring to the evidence. This man does not torture suspects; he will only follow the evidence. This man knows his stuff.\n\nWhat happens when these opposing forces meet? A complete mess is what happens, to say the least. Detective Seo will slowly show these two lazy-asses how to run an investigation, and despite his efforts to show how scientific procedures can help you bring down a serial killer, these two dirt-bags will try to show this pragmatic detective how their ways are the right ones, how esoteric methods can beat science, how rumors are more valid then congruent pieces of evidence, how, just for the fact that South Korea is a small country, the methods used by other countries, such as the U.S., won't work in that country: \"Korea is of the size of my penis, that's why we investigate with our feet, because you can walk the whole country in day\" detective Park said to detective Seo. \n\nSo we have two characters that take major roles: detective Park and detective Seo, and they make a great contrast for the plot.\n\nNow we have to talk about the one person who will bring this to a nice triangle: the murderer; who is he? It doesn't matter, he is just a McGuffin used to let characters develop their worst sides or their better sides - again this movie is just about characters, about the way humans behave under extreme circumstances. Still we get to spend a lot of time with all the suspects and their different personalities.\n\nSo all you have to concentrate on is what the main characters do or say throughout the movie since everything will be vital for the plot.\n\nYou get to enjoy the moments where you see detective Park spend time with his wife: we get moments intimacy, moments where they talk and he shows some jealousy because his wife - a nurse - gets requested the most by patients at the hospital, and we get to see where most of detective Park's not-so-clever-ideas come from, ideas such as \"going with a psychic\" to find out who the murderer is.\n\nThe characters in the story are just as real and perfect as they can get, and the serial killer story hits the jackpot of story-telling. So what about the directing of the movie? Admirable is the adjective I'll use to answer. You can't really expect much from director Bong's sophomore attempt at filmmaking with a near-broke studio, right? Wrong. Director Bong made wonderful use of camera work; take one of the first scenes of the movie: we get a nice long shot that shows us what mess of a crime scene the detectives had due to their incompetence and terrible communication. \n\nWe get some beautiful takes of the landscapes with great natural lighting, and thanks to the opportunistic weather at the time of filming, we get some wonderful takes that really captured the depressed feeling that director Bong wanted to project to the audience.\n\nThe movie itself has a great sense of humor at the beginning, since the movie itself satirizes the South Korean system, all the way from the press, police force, political views, and the way we sometimes tend to think. But near the end of the movie we start to feel a brilliant change of humor, from a witty sense of humor, to a very serious thriller, we start to see the characters get more serious in the plot; we start to feel the tension of the plot as it reaches its brilliant ending.\n\nThis way of making the seriousness of the plot change makes the movie all the more better: you get moments of laughs and you get moments of tension.\n\nThis change, however, does not only happen in the plot, it also happens to the characters - the two main characters - take detective Park for instance: corrupt, incompetent, lazy, and stupid at times, turns out by the end, in a beautifully executed scene (train track scene), we get to see him coming clean and admitting that he does not know who can be guilty of a crime by just simply looking at their eyes. \n\nDetective Seo, the pragmatic, flat-footed detective, on the other hand, starts to succumb to the nasty ways of detective Park: he starts to lose his nerve and even slaps the poor mentally disabled suspect, who happens to know the identity of the killer, in an attempt to get the kids testimony for evidence. It doesn't end well for the mentally disabled kid... We also see detective Seo beat the living hell out of the main suspect just because he is so sure he's the killer, but then the evidence (the documents) shows him that he is not the killer; all this will just push detective Seo to the edge of madness. Now all this is shown in that one masterful/powerful scene along with detective Park's moment of clarity: one sees the light, the other sees the darkness; talk about good writing and good directing.\n\nThe movie's ending is just sublime, it will leave you make you think more about the whole movie... gives me the chills just by thinking of that last close shot at detective Park's look, you can really feel him all the way to the end of that scene.\n\nThe audacity for directing, writing, and cinematography in this movie is just fabulous, one couldn't ask for more. \n\nThis movie was hailed by Tarantino in one of his interviews as one of the most interesting and complex movie he had ever seen, and damn right it is!\nThis movie was made for all type of audiences, it's fun, interesting, intriguing, and cathartic. You will be missing out on one of the best movies of modern times.\n\nFun fact: one of the studios that produced the movie: Sidus, was near bankruptcy when the movie was filmed, and due to the movie's unexpected success the studio went back on track and is now a major studio in South Korea.",

            "content": "Review In A Nutshell:\n\nEven though I was left underwhelmed by Chan-wook Park's Oldboy, I still had hope for Korean cinema, knowing that maybe if I keep exploring and tasting new films by different directors; I would eventually find one that would suit to my tastes. It was fortunate that it only took two films to find that sense of satisfaction; it was by the mind and hands of Joon-ho Bong, his sophomore feature film Memories of Murder.\n\nMemories of Murder features a strong and appealing premise of a rape-murder mystery set in a local town; two detectives with their own distinctive styles have been chosen to solve the case. It is in the difference of each detective's style that the film manages to be interesting; with comedic touches set by the director in order to let the first hour or so of the film to not be too suffocating with its serious and dire subject. It was through this that the characters were unique, allowing both to stand out from one another and create a sense of clash of ethics and methods, but the film does not resort to the clich\u00e9d elevation of internal tension, letting both characters be focused and determined to identify and catch the person responsible for these sickening crimes.\n\nThe mystery of the plot itself starts off being a bit slow in exposition, it takes a while for the audience to find something to chew on; it is only when facts start to emerge and solidify their importance to the story, that the film starts to pick up its pace, and create tension; evoking a sense of urgency that is felt both on screen and in ourselves. It is during the final hour of the film that I found myself highly engaged by its mystery and suspense, with comedic elements finally carrying a sense of weight for the characters; showing a sense of desperation, meaning that the case has finally crawled within the inner depths of their souls, becoming an obsession rather than an obligation. It is during this part of the film that the dialogue driven exposition begins to slow itself down, halted by tense chase sequences and big reveals that leaves audiences in a state of exhilaration.\n\nIt all builds, brick by brick, to a conclusion that satisfies in a way that one wouldn't expect. It becomes internal rather than external; emphasising the detectives themselves rather than bigger story; it is character development that has slowly been building under our noses, paying off at the end that makes one want to go back and see their entire journey again. The film ends with a final frame that speaks volumes of its ideas and themes; I feel it would be unfair to those who have yet seen the film to divulge these thematic elements, as its exposure may hurt the impact the film would have to surprise and intellectually stimulate. Also it would be better for me to discuss it when I have seen the film multiple times, understanding all the elements that make up the film.\n\nMemories of Murder is a damn near perfect mystery thriller that keeps audiences on their toes and delivering a conclusion that beautifully exceeds one's expectations. This is a film that does not aim to satisfy the immediate desires of its audience, it targets the nerves in our body that find excitement in deep and resonating intellectual and emotional stimulation.",

I believe (until otherwise) that the way the murders happen was real, but the practice and the approach into solving those murders isn't convincing at all, since one of the homicide officers who's in charge of the case gradually assaults his suspects without any solid proof, reminiscent of how the Dirty Harry character does in his movies. There's a serial killer around the countryside who goes after young girls with only a small group of people to solve it.  They decide to incorporate someone from the local city to help solve it since his approach is radically different than the homicide detective assigned to.  Some of the inconsistencies also include eyewitnesses and the fact that they're too many coincidences as well as obstacles stacked up against them into solving them since the unit is insufficiently funded by it's gov't. \r\n\r\n2.5 out of 4 stars",

            "content": "MEMORIES OF MURDER\nMAY CONTAIN SPOILERS\n\nBong Joon-ho's \"Memories of Murder\" disappoints; I expected good things out of this one. It's a South Korean film based on the first actual recordings of serial murders in the country. There are great films that ask questions rather than giving answers and it works; \"Memories of Murder,\" to me is a film that would have worked better if it gave answers instead of asking questions, it deprived me of a satisfying experience. I don't think I am spoiling much because the film's opening subtitles already tell you it's based on \"an unresolved criminal investigation.\" It has three major flaws in its story: it takes too long for the detectives to revisit the mentally challenged boy regarding a murder, to me it was obvious. Also since it is believed that the serial killer murders women who are wearing red on rainy nights, why were the last two victims not wearing red? The first, older woman leaves her red jacket at home and for the latter of the two it did not rain. I am guessing the detectives' information was false regarding this killer, but I still consider it a flaw because these amending observations are never mentioned by the detectives or anyone else. The last issue I have is of one of the detective's wife crossing paths with a girl that is going to be murdered; why didn't the wife mention this to her husband? Throughout the film we see the husband and wife talk to each other about various things regarding his work, about suspects and what not; why don't they mention this to each other? I also found the investigations to be tiresome where the detectives beat up the suspects and it's also somewhat predictable.\n\nThe director is able to build suspense and its actors provide good performances, especially Song Kang-ho as detective Park. It also can be quite funny at times. Even with its flaws and it eventually faltering, it still is an enjoyable crime-drama, especially the chase scene. I see where the director was going with this but to me the point was not clearly informed.\n\nP.S. How stupid are these women to be alone so late at night? Couldn't they find any other means to reach their destination? I found it baffling, one or two in particular obviously were aware that there are killings taking place.",

The movie has so much intrigue that no matter the lack of action scenes, the viewer will still be glued to the screen. I recommend this movie to be watched in high definition so the viewer can appreciate the scenery as it mesmerizes you with the audio and top notch cinematography that is at hand here. There is an investigation in town about murders that are happening at an alarming rate, but when the detectives can't find the culprit they start scavenging for clues. This guess work leads to some interesting leads that find the main actor struggling for an answer he can't 100 percent put his judgement on. At the end of the movie the viewer is left in one the most captivating ending scenes of all time in my opinion. After the movie is over you are left in a nirvana you must or want to experience again.",

Memories of Murder is a police procedural with police whose procedures are lacking, with shots of humor in a story of gruesome circumstances. The movie runs a little long, but by the end, accomplishes more than a basic cop story's worth of \"yay we caught the evil guy.\"",

The laughter however doesn't come from a purely comedic place, but more from an absurdest and surreal which balances the pure darkness of the crimes rather beautifully one might say. The direction is rich in style and content and guides the story and characters through this journey with feeling and purpose, while the story is wonderfully written and presented, with only a couple of scenes here and there that are a tad overlong. Not much else to say really, and I definitely recommend this type of film, as opposed to the paint-by-numbers thrillers that Hollywood sometimes churns out when they are afraid that the audience might get confused, or god forbid talk about the film's meaning afterwards.",

            "content": "South-Korean Cinema is one of those areas which I have yet to completely explore. Thanks to the Brutal thrilling Korean classic Oldboy, came out in 2003, I got highly excited about exploring the Korean world continuing my journey with this incredible film: Memories of Murder. \n\nMemories of Murder, based on a true story, is a crime thriller set in the late 1980's. Two rural cops and a special detective from Seoul try hard to search for the killer who ruthlessly rapes women, especially on rainy nights a factor that probably excites him. The film shows us the usual cat-and-mouse chase. Though it's not an experience that cliched thrillers gives, just running around here and there...\n\nWhat mostly bothers me are the subtitles in any foreign movie. The way you have to look down every time while missing all the action even on a small scale might distract you. Memories of Murder is one of those foreign films where the above factor just doesn't completely apply. Some of the best scenes of this film happen in silence. There are truly great examples of camera work in this film that includes the dry but powerful cinematography, few but effective Steadicam shots and of course the direction. Like in one scene when the lead Detective comes to inspect the first crime scene (also filmed in one continuous shot), they find a shoe print nearby on a small road as an evidence. Suddenly, a tractor comes out of nowhere and ignoring the Detective's cries (\"No Stop!\") it goes over the evidence smudging the entire print. This is one particular scenario which was shot with such realism that you connect yourself with the movie and become a part of it. I don't care how simple or complex the scenes are, the most vital property of any good cinema is that it should allow you to become a part of that experience. Even sounds are important in this film. Can't explain that in detail but you will notice it once you have seen it. The acting too is superb, as always in any great film.\n\nMemories of Murder though doesn't concentrate much on the murders, it kind of gives more attention to the emotional aspects of the characters involved the case. Hence, the name. When you say Memories of Murder it refers not only to the ones solving the case but also the ones who were the victim of this brutality. The film truly goes more beyond the thriller part and at the conclusion of the film, no one will deny that they had watched something different. The downside is that it takes little patience to watch the film and the film's ending is not that easy to take in. Still, I am highly impressed by the different style of film-making of South-Koreans. \n\nIn conclusion, Memories of Murder is a realistic document of the incident, not like some Hollywood flicks that put in some spice like an exit line just after killing someone or the hero looking walking away from an explosion. If you are a good lover of cinema, this will hardly disappoint you. There is one thing I have learned so far in South-Korean thrillers: Always expect the unexpected. Just in case of this film, it comes out in a very subtle manner...\n\nVisit my facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/filmsthemostbeautifulart",

I didn't mind the ending (i won't give it away) and most of it was interesting without being anything special.

            "content": "I may very well be the only person in the entire world who is not in love with this film, please bear this in mind if you read on.\n\nThe story of inane, underfunded detectives in a rural town in South Korea and their investigation of serial sexual assaults and murders committed by someone whom has proved faultless and far too elusive for small-town detectives to catch. This is the backdrop for what the movie really is, which is a lecture on the horrors of certainty, and the cruelness of doubt.\n\nI won't go into it, in an effort to avoid filling my review with the usual myriad spoilers. Instead, I'd like to focus on the superficial layer- the story and the way in which we are narrated to. Often in an attempt to build character, the story will plough off in tangential directions- this technique normally works for me, but here left me a little drowsy. The characters weren't real for me, never once did the film seem to be too fussed whether or not you particularly care about the central cast, so why bother wasting time with these distractions? What I'm saying is that the film is far from taut, quite in fact, overly long would not be an understatement.\n\nThe acting here is great, and the characters are filled with personality by their very capable actors- speaking of which, you really do need to love Korean actors and their willingness to literally throw themselves into their parts- all of whom do a great job. Unfortunately, however, they're put in the difficult position of performing a tricky balancing act. Joon-ho Bong is asking them to juggle the severely macabre with quirky, almost slapstick humour. Not an easy feat by far, and not amusing for myself in the slightest. Perhaps the idea was to add some relief for the viewer from the lazy plot? \n\nThe biggest crime committed here is to waste such a talented cast and beautiful cinematography and direction on such a dull story. Conventional is perhaps not enough in describing how prosaic the story is. A certain adjective must be applied, but which is suitably strong I'm not certain. Rigidly conventional, perhaps? One couldn't help but compare the film to the likes of Seven, etc. And yes, in the long run, Memories of Murder does indeed have more value, but I know which I'd rather watch again. Strangely, when I found myself comparing Memories of Murder to other films of the genre, I found that my head wouldn't drift to other films, but in fact to television. And how much better certain TV shows were in almost every respect to this film. \n\nQuite in fact, this whole genre has been out-sleuthed by it's televised counterpart. The once bastard child of the visual arts, in it's renaissance, out-classes and out-characterises film to such a level as to almost make this type of tale a vainglorious waste when displayed on the cinema screen. Almost. See, what cinema still has, and will always have over television, is brevity. The ability to make an existential observation, or frame a timeless and endlessly endearing story is somewhat difficult when drafted well over 50-odd hours of footage and script. Well-crafted film is also beautiful- and that is a particular strength of this film. Joon-ho Bong clearly has a special sense when it comes to knowing just how to frame the beautiful Korean countryside; it's pretty glorious here with all it's rustic charm.\n\nThe story though, with all it's twists and it's turns, in the end follows the sign-posts of the genre. There are ups, there are downs, there's a murder, there's a clue, there's a twist, and so on. The Wire captures the intricacies of the reality behind the drug war, The Killing with it's often gruellingly slow pace manages to manifest all of the characters in the show with layers of depth, elevating itself far above the stock crime procedural. What does Memories of Murder do? This is the question I asked myself when determining how I would score it. I found very little to distinguish it from other movies of a similar ilk- up until the end, of course. But, sadly, that just wasn't enough.\n\nThe strengths of 'Memories of Murder' are very much the talented crew, beautiful shots of the Korean countryside, and the lingering sadness it evokes long after the credits roll.\n\nFrankly? I preferred The Chaser.",
