The cast remains excellent, making the entire crew a brilliant mix of anti-heroes who care about each other even if they don't want to admit it.  The filmmakers also continue the great work of the show, and while it is essentially an overblown episode of the series, it delivers in scope and action.  Plus, since it takes place during Halloween, a great addition for any October rotation.",

Each scene is astonishing. Everything about this movie I loved. Yet, the story, plot, and characters seemed out of place. Things that weren't introduced or done in the series was done in the movie.\n\nWhen has Spike ever flirted with other women in the series? He had a thing for Julia and Julia only. Who seriously says \"your friendly neighborhood bounty hunter?\" What happened to Elektra(?) after the end of the movie? So many questions unresolved.\n\nMost of the movie seems to be more of a fanfic than an actual piece of the Cowboy Bebop universe. A cash grab for the fanboys, of course.\n\n4/5. It's a great movie.

No I don't work for Netflix but alot of movies are easily accessible on that platform. It's possible you can watch this movie without watching the show. The show is very unique and reaches a wide variety of audiences because of deep philosophical themes of existentialism, loneliness and fate. I also think memory in relation to the human psyche and learning how to best cope with tragedy and loss. Which reminds me that I should definitely revisit this wonderful animated feature that has an excellent cast of voices such as Steve Blum and Beau Billingslea. I've heard of a live adaptation of this movie and won't be surprised if it comes out in the near future. The writers craftily introduce and outroduce(I just made up a word) characters that make a great misadventure. I'm not just speaking about the movie in his review I'm actually speaking of the entire series however this is only a site that rates movies so yea. It gives you a great appreciation for jazz and music and being cool can come in all shapes and sizes.

Cowboy Bebop The Movie takes place between episodes 22 and 23 of the original run of the show. You don't really have to know much about the show or in this case watched it to enjoy the movie, but hey it helps. The film follows a bounty hunter crew led by Spike Spiegel (Steve Blum), his right hand man Jet Black (Beau Billingslea), Faye Valentine (Wendee Lee) a young lady that joined them early on in the show and works with them, and Edward Wong (Melissa Fahn) a young kid with super great hacking abilities. The movie centers around the crew tracking down Vincent Volaju (Daran Norris) a terrorist that was the sole survivor of a genetic experiment on Titan. Vincent is trying to release a microvirus that will kill millions. Spike teams up with Vincents ex-lover Electra Ovirowa (Jennifer Hale) who actually works for the same medical company that experimented on Vincent. Together Spike and Electra work together to stop Vincent before its too late. The movie's animation is great. Since it came out after the series ended the animation is presented in wide screen HD and it's definitely a step above the shows animation. The movie has a pretty good plot, but I found it took too long to get into the meat of the plot. In typical Anime fashion they wasted about the first 40 minutes to get to the point. The show's original episodes were 22-24 minutes long so jumping to a movie thats almost 2 hours they lost a bit of the fast pacing they usually had. I still enjoyed it overall. Although, the movie basically only follows Spike (Jet, Faye and Edward all take a back seat on thus one) I still found it enjoyable. Fans of the show probably have already seen this, but if not definitely give it a look!",

Just like The Godfather showed gangster dramas could be more than just pulpy entertainment, Cowboy Bebop showed anime could be thought provoking, stylish, and down right tear jerking, and Cowboy Bebop: the Movie, is more than worthy than being associated with the series. It delivers all the slick action, cool dialogue, and thought provoking themes of the series in a 2 hour time slot. Another cool thing about the film is the fact that even if you haven't seen the show, you can still enjoy it. It's a film for just about anyone, but I'd still recommend watching the series first. Set between episodes 22 and 23, this film follows the crew of the Bebop as they try to uncover the true behind a series of mysterious bombing on civilian areas. It may sound basic, but it gets a lot more complex than that. Basically telling you anymore would spoil the film. I do feel some areas of the film are a little heavy handed though, but it's not enough to take away from the overall experience. Fans of anime will love it, and those newer to the genre should find enjoyment as well.",

It's so faithful to the original series that it feels like an elongated episode but not to the point where it feels stretched out and adds enough to it to make the leap to film necessary and that's an amazing job and one of the best things it accomplishes. \n\nAnother great thing about it is that you can watch this without having watched the show, although, unless you didn't know there was a show, even though it has 'The Movie' in the title, I don't know why would want to. It starts off just like any other episode, it has a cool introduction and then smoothly transitions into the main plot. The story of the movie is very good, it fits the feel of the series and has quite a lot of interesting character development and shocking moments. I liked the villain, he was just cool, something I don't usually pay attention to, I don't normally just like a villain just because they're cool. I need to know about them in order to like them and in typical fashion we do learn about him and he does have a very interesting backstory which is actually quite tragic and it just makes him more cool and interesting. The Bebop crew are still the same as ever with the same excellent voice cast and it's great to see more of them. And hey the three old guys even get a cameo!\n\nThe animation is excellent and the action scenes are fluid and look beautiful. The soundtrack is also fantastic, which is just like anime, the bebop is still as amazing as ever, although, there were perhaps one too many vocal songs for my liking but they fit the scenes they were in so I guess it makes sense. The only complaint I really have is that I think the movie finished a little too quickly, the big fight scene was still going and there was only about 4 minutes left, I thought the ending was going to be cut off. However, it did wrap up well and it wasn't a bad ending, I'd just have liked it to slow down a bit. So, I'd have like the movie to go on longer, not really a complaint and having 2 hours more Bebop is already brilliant so I guess I shouldn't complain. \n\nThe only thing I think non-fans will question if they do decide to watch this, for some reason, is that Ed doesn't really do anything and they might question her point. True that she didn't do a whole lot in the anime either, besides getting details for the crew but at least we know where she came from and a little bit about her past. Which is a problem I have with the show, after she was introduced and needed in episode 9, it seemed like the creators forgot she was even in the show, even I did when I first watched it, she showed up again after being absent and I went, 'oh yeah! She's here!', I still love her though, I think she's a brilliant character. \n\nIt is more than worthy to be connected with the main series and I'm very happy that this was made and was successful as it was. Cowboy Bebop: The Movie is the perfect companion piece to a brilliant show and it's just a cool movie,  I will be watching this many more times in the future. See You Space Cowboy.",

            "content": "Apparently, Bob Dylan Isn't an [i]Otaku[/i]\r\n\r\nI've never seen the TV show.  The top two reviews on Rotten Tomatoes right now are in conflict about whether this is a good thing or not.  One says it's a great introduction to the show.  The other says that, like with [i]Serenity[/i], you won't like it if you haven't seen the TV show.  Only I really liked [i]Serenity[/i] the first time I saw it, and I hadn't seen the TV show of that, either.  Then again, I have a certain ability to trace the threads that don't actually appear.  I mean, the only question I had after the end of [i]Serenity[/i] was why the show was called [i]Firefly[/i].  Similarly, I don't entirely get the reason the anime is called [i]Cowboy Bebop[/i], and I'm suspecting the exchange is somehow off and that dollars on the show aren't the same as current dollars, but in general, I was able to pick up on most of what was going on and didn't feel like I was missing anything in particular.\r\n\r\nWe're on Mars.  Spike Spiegel (K\u00f4ichi Yamadera), Jet Black (Unsh\u00f4 Ishizuka), and Faye Valentine (Megumi Hayashibara) are all bounty hunters.  Spike and Jet are doing some relatively piddling work.  Faye is going after a minor hacker, only it turns into some kind of major thing.  There's a guy named Vincent Volaju (Tsutomu Isobe).  Despite a ban against it, the government of Mars has been dabbling in experimental nanotechnology.  However, Vincent has been infected with experimental anti-nanotechnology.  Of course.  And he's planning to destroy the government, etc., of Mars by putting the nanotechnology in the water supply, which will pretty much destroy all the people.  At least, I think that was what was going on.  Anyway, the government of Mars is offering a pretty enormous bounty for Vincent, and even if they weren't, Our Heroes would kind of like the entire population of Mars to not die.  So they have to spread the anti-nanotechnology over the entire population in order to thwart Vincent.\r\n\r\nOkay, no, I wasn't able to work out everything that was going on.  For one thing, it was just too hot.  I don't deal well with heat.  For another, I actually watched this yesterday, and I didn't get around to writing a review until just now after having not watched anything but episodes of TV shows today.  However, I have to tell you, the characters aren't as in-depth as the characters of [i]Serenity[/i], and while there does seem to be a lot of backstory, I'm not sure how much it all mattered.  For all I didn't actually need to know it, the backstory of [i]Serenity[/i] was very clearly shaping every frame of that film, and it didn't feel as though this was the case here.  It's a bunch of bounty hunters on Mars, and a government has done a thing that it shouldn't.  This is not complicated.  It's interesting, and I may get around to the TV show at some point (probably after the heat breaks), but that doesn't mean it required a lot of thought, either.\r\n\r\nApparently, if you know what you're looking for, you can tell exactly what guns everyone is using and work out what the planes are in the sequence at the end.  (Why all those antique planes are on Mars is another thing that never gets explained, however; at least one of those planes is old even by our standards, and this movie is set some time in our future.)  It certainly is true that the animation is beautifully detailed.  I find that people who don't watch anime tend to have a specific perception of what all the art is like, and the art in this movie isn't like that.  I mean, okay, there's Ed (Aoi Tada), who's a bit chibi and about whom I would have liked some more information, but she isn't even onscreen very often.  Spike, Faye, Jet, and Electra (Ai Kobayashi) all look pretty much human--more realistic than a lot of Western animation.  This is the product of people really trying to make the characters look like people, not like caricatures.  Some of the backgrounds are frankly stunning, too.\r\n\r\nNo, I don't see this as the kind of anime that I would sit down and watch just for pleasure.  I'm not one of those people who will watch anime just because it's anime, despite my incredible distaste of people who won't watch anime just because it's anime.  In general, I pick and choose.  The characters in this seem to have a lot of potential that's probably better explored in the TV show, where there's more room to do it.  However, I'm not sure I'm terribly interested in them.  It's a science fiction show, technically, but--again not unlike [i]Serenity[/i]--its science fiction core isn't completely relevant to the course of the story.  That's okay; science fiction can be as much a setting as a genre, if you do it right.  That's one of the reasons I have such a hard time finding the border between sci-fi and fantasy; [i]Star Wars[/i] only stays on the sci-fi side of the line because spaceships, really.  This is mostly just action, except it's action set on Mars.  And drawn by Japanese people.",

This is too long, and doesn't explore any of the characters. The dialogue and direction are still \"Bebop - Brilliant\" which slightly redeems this one. Don't get me wrong though it's still boring.",

This is not just an action or a thriller but a deep look into the protagonists psyche without love. The real story is overlooked because of many unnecessary scenes which reveal the actions of the Martian government. I'd suggest anyone that didn't like this to seriously re-watch and listen very closely to Spike when he speaks. Everything from \"We're not cops\" to \"He was always alone\" reflects deeply the underlying story.",
