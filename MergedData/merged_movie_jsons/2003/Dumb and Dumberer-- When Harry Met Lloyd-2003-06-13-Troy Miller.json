            "content": "People judge this movie too harshly because it's a prequel to a beloved movie. Yes, the original Dumb & Dumber is far better. Of course it is. No one expected this movie to surpass the original. I honestly think they did a pretty good job. A good number of jokes landed for me and the actors did a great job of portraying what I think a young Harry and Lloyd would act like. They do a better job playing the characters and the actual same actors did in the sequel \"Dumb and Dumber To\". This movie is way better than that one in my opinion.Overall, not nearly as bad as people say and deserves more credit. 6/10.",

For what it was the film is at least loyal to the characters who are both stupid and you don't know who's stupider. This is way better than that terrible sequel made last year, where all the jokes were based on how gross it could be. I never liked the idea of prequels but this film I think did it fine. The only thing I think would of been a wiser idea is had Harry take Lloyd's role of being the one to tell him what to do. I mean Harry is a leader in the original but here he is more of like a sidekick. I really liked the scene, \"There's Sh.t everywhere!\" The only things I wish they changed were Harry and Lloyd's roles and also maybe add a funnier climax but it's overall alright! I can't believe people hate this but the sequel made last year is rated higher! I think these rating should be switched! I give it a 6.5 out of 10.",

Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels were excellent in the first film and in a different league to the two actors in the roles as the young Harry and Lloyd (the guy cast as Lloyd does look like Carrey, except for the blue eyes). If there was ever going to be another film about these two characters it should have been a sequel starring the original pairing, instead we get this stinker. Dumb and Dumber hardly had an Oscar winning story line but gave us some great characters and a hatful of ball bouncingly funny gags, in the 'prequel' the weak story collapses under the weight of even weaker jokes! So uninspired is this movie that there are even rehashes of jokes from the original, just done slightly differently but in a totally inept manner. Dumb and Dumber is a classic, this is a pile of steaming doggy doo doo's. Do yourself a favour stick with the Carrey film and avoid this limp fish at all costs.",

Also I found this movie absolutely not funny but it's simply insulting and disgusting instead. You must protect your kids from seeing it. It's very sadly to see so talented actors (including Shia Lebeouf, who looked very good in Holes) involved in this disaster. Avoid all costs and stay away as far as you can from this garbage. It worse than anybody could expect. Don't see it even for free! Trust me! I never felt so miserably than I watched this trash. Why, Why I have lost my time and my money for it? Nobody knows.

            "content": "I really liked the original Dumb and Dumber. I thought it was a hilarious comedy that was better than it looked because of the writing/directing of the Farrelly Brothers and the acting of Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels. When I originally heard that they were doing a sequel to Dumb and Dumber, I was somewhat enthusiastic. Then, it was announced that they were doing a prequel. Enthusiasm meter dropped some. Then, the Farrelly Brothers announced that they wouldn't be involved. Enthusiasm went down some more. And finally, it was said that Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels weren't returning and were to be replaced by younger people. Enthusiasm went straight to hell. But I still decided to give it a chance because Eugene Levy was in it and he always finds a way to make the movies he's in funny. I was wrong again.The plot - Harry and Llyod meet in the '80's and foil the corrupt principal's plans to steal money for himself and his mistress, the trashy lunch lady. Easily the stupidest plot I have ever heard. And I haven't even started dissecting this trash yet.Besides being a waste of celluloid, I have never seen such a cast whose talents were so horribly wasted. And there were so many good actors in this. There was Eugene Levy, Cheri Oteri, Luis Guzm\u00e1n, Mimi Rogers, Shia LaBeouf, and the obligatory cameo by Lin Shaye that happens with nearly every film from New Line (in fact, I wonder if she has some hidden cameo in the Lord of the Rings trilogy). The two actors who replaced Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels - Eric Christian Olsen and Derek Richardson - are good replicates, but they just weren't Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels. The cameo with Bob Saget was dead before it even began. And then, this \"film\" is so filled with so many mistakes (not including the film itself), I still wonder if this was done accidentally or by the filmmakers to see how many people would notice every mistake the film was filled with.I thought Gigli was a much better film than this (and that's saying something). This film is nothing but a waste of time, celluloid, talent, and air. I would rather have a root canal without anesthesia than sit through this hunk of garbage, which I rated as the #1 worst movie of 2003, ever again.",

            "content": "It's hard to believe that it's actually been almost a decade since the first Dumb and Dumber, which was deservedly a smash hit, was released on the unsuspecting populace. I can see it now. I was in tenth grade, and I still remember ditching class in beautiful Irvine, California to ride my bicycle over to Fashion Island in Newport Beach so my friend and I could steal bubble gum from one of the ritzy drugstores and then go see this movie, which we must have seen in the theaters half a dozen times or so. Where we got the money I've been trying to remember for years. I'd like to start out by saying that I don't know that the prequel to the brilliant Dumb and Dumber (easily one of the most hilarious comedies to come along in decades) really deserves all of the vicious reviews that it has received from professional and amateur critics alike. It has been a popular and critical disaster from the day it was released, and while it's true that it is simply a bad, bad movie, I think that anyone claiming it to be 'absolutely THE worst movie I've EVER seen' might be exaggerating just a little bit. Or maybe I've just seen worse movies than these people. I've seen some seriously bad movies, and while Dumb and Dumberer is certainly an embarrassing flop, I've seen worse. It's better than Scary Movie 2 and 3 combined, for example. That being said, on to the crapfests. Dumb and Dumberer, since I have neither the energy nor interest to research the intentions, strikes me almost unmistakably as one of those movies that one studio makes of another studio's movie. Kind of like how Pixar just publicly insulted Disney at the same time as they ended the two companies' partnership, and Pixar promptly announced that they would be making Toy Story 3. I expect Toy Story 3 may be a disaster (if the 'threat' was serious), possibly even purposely, in order to get back at Disney. I don't know that this prequel to Dumb and Dumber was done for revenge at all, but I can't say that it's all that mysterious as to why the original cast and crew had little to nothing to do with it.That being said, I have to say that I'm impressed with the actors they found to play the younger Harry and Lloyd, especially Lloyd, because this guy, without the bowl-cut and the chipped tooth, looks NOTHING like Jim Carrey's Lloyd, but in the movie he's the spitting image. This is one of the reasons that I think the movie deserves at least minor respect. At least the casting director was on the ball. Sadly, it's all downhill from there. I have to admit that I was pretty happy to see Bob Saget acting again. Granted, I barely remember him in Full House at all and I saw his one spoken line in Half Baked as the official end of his acting career, but I loved his cheesy jokes on America's Funniest Home Videos (the ORIGINAL show) so much that seeing him on screen again was almost like a trip back to my childhood.And then Harry had a little incident involving chocolate, and I started to squirm in my seat, as I'm sure many other people started to do, given the reviews I've read. It is expected that some memorable scene from the original film would be almost duplicated in a sequel like this, but Harry getting diarrhea in the original movie was funny because it was there for a reason. Lloyd put massive amounts of laxative in Harry's tea to get revenge on him for dating the girl that he was after. Crude, yes, but still funny. In this movie, Harry goes nuts with the chocolate in the bathroom and then Jessica's poor dad (Bob Saget) comes in and screams a numbing stream of profanity about there being feces all over his bathroom. Not only is this supposed to be funny, but there is so much stock put into this idea that it's duplicated again later in the film. It's sad that a comedy as smashing and brilliant as Dumb and Dumber has been followed up by such a stupid, stupid film. While I admit that you can hardly expect for them to have created something as great as Dumb and Dumber again, I really didn't think that they could have come up with something THIS bad. I mean, just the name itself should have inspired some better ideas for the movie. Sadly, it seems that the powers that be were more interested in throwing a sequel out there than they were in actually making it deserve its title. And when a movie isn't good enough to deserve a title like Dumb & Dumberer, it's a bad, bad sign.",

But after seeing opening credits (No Jim & Jeff), I was a little sceptical. Never mind, it still can be good...Erghh, wrong. The movie was getting worse and worse. The leading characters were shown like a couple of retards (very unlikable, since in original there aren't THAT slow), who were just trying to imitate Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels and failed miserably. Lack of charm, i guess. But the main fault goes to script writer who provides a lot of already seen jokes as the rest of the producers of this crap.I agree, it would be nearly impossible to beat the original version, since it was full of original black humor, but hey, at least they could try harder. Despite that movie sucked, it has some moments...but since i can't remember any if them, i couldn't rate it higher than3 out of 10.",

            "content": "I have a weird obsession....to see all of IMDB's Bottom 100---the one hundred lowest rated major release films of all time. Unfortunately, I'll probably never complete the list, as a couple of the remaining films are Turkish and one is German...and it's highly unlikely they'll bother captioning films hated this much by the audiences. For me, \"Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd\" is the 95th film I've seen...a dubious accomplishment, I know.The original \"Dumb and Dumber\" was a silly but mildly enjoyable film (I just rewatched it). And, the studio came up with a brilliant idea....since they couldn't get Jeff Daniels and Jim Carrey for a sequel (or, more likely they didn't want to PAY them for a sequel), they made a prequel with unknown actors playing the leads. The fans were NOT amused.The story begins long before \"Dumb and Dumber\" and near the very beginning, Harry and Lloyd* bump into each other for the first time. Soon they are buddies and soon the pair are assigned to the school's new fake special needs class. This is because the evil principal (Eugene Levy....who is just too good for films like this) wants to create a fake special needs class to get additional funding...which he can embezzle. Instead of a real classroom, it's in a shed and the lunch lady is in charge....and soon Harry and Lloyd sign up several other students for the class. Will the Principal be able to get away with this case of fraud?\nSo is any of this funny? Not especially. Mostly it's annoying and occasionally offensive (such as how they deal with mental disabilities as well as the MANY sexist jokes). This isn't too surprising since it is on the list AND the original folks who made the film had nothing to do with this project. However, it's not among the very worst films I've seen and I think it made the list mostly because compared to the original film it was an unfunny abomination.\n*FYI, the actors appear to be about 25...a bit old for high school. But a lot of the 'students' in the movie appear to be quite old as well.",

            "content": "This movie flat out sucks. There's no other, smart guy way to put it. Its horrible. Its the worst prequel I've ever seen, the jokes are pure, raw slapstick in it's lowest possible form, and the two leads may look like Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels, but there's no way in hell they could pull it off like they did in 1994. Also, if you're going to make a prequel, set in 1986, use stuff in 1986. We see new dollar bills and the most fatal flaw is the song \"Ice Ice Baby\" by Vanilla Ice. The song came out in 1990 and this is set in 1986. Sense? Nada. This movie was clearly rushed, not thought over properly, and serves no purpose.Lets begin with the cover for the DVD. If you closely at Lloyds tooth it is clear that the left corner is just drawn with Sharpie marker or some dry erase marker to look as if it was missing. Nothing says a movie is worse than when the cover doesn't even look believable. A poor entrance to a poor movie. Fits perfectly.Before Harry and Lloyd where the best of dumb buddies, they were in high school struggling to make the grade. Now we get to the moment they first met by bumping heads. Harry was homeschooled and is now attending regular school. Upon meeting Lloyd whom gives him a half assed tour of the school, they now become the best of friends and are inseparable. After a class opens called \"The Special Needs\" class, Harry and Lloyd are asked to get people to attend. A good girl Jessica finds out why the lunch lady would be teaching a class and she soon discovers that the principal and the teacher for the fake Specials class are stealing money from the school and it's now up to Harry, Lloyd, and Jessica to stop them.Since the movie is supposed to be focused on the stupid characters of Harry and Lloyd, I shouldn't say this, but need to. It gets incredibly aggravating because the stupidity of the characters makes the movie move in a slow pace and even though its a mere 86 minutes it feels way longer. Harry and Lloyd are portrayed as stupid beyond belief. There's no way anyone in the world could be this stupid and not be mentally challenged. Its an insult.I too find it absolutely hilarious that the cameo appearance by Bob Saget is funnier than the two leads in the movie. Bob Saget's cameo is nowhere near as funny to earn this movie an extra star, but its damn sure funny to earn it probably the most memorable thing about this movie. Julia Duffy doesn't do much in the movie, but I remember her as Mrs. Hayfer in Drake & Josh. Those will be the only two people who I cite as a \"decent job done\" in this movie. Eugene Levy is awful in this movie and so are the actors who portray Harry and Lloyd. Luis Guzm\u00e1n also does a poor job in this as well.I thought I'd approach this film with an open mind and have a decent attitude and relate it to something me and my friend do. I like a lot of stupid movies like Bio-Dome, but this just completely blew my mind. From the DVD menu gags to the \"Dont press this button\" joke on there as well I knew this movie was going to be no more than two stars if they found burping and farting to be the most hilarious joke on the planet. Sure enough I was right. Worst prequel to any movie and awful movie all together.Starring: Eric Christian Olsen, Derek Richardson, Rachel Nichols, Bob Saget, Luis Guzm\u00e1n, Eugene Levy, and Mimi Rogers.",

I just don't understand how they could make this movie and throw feces all over the memory of the first one.

            "content": "Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd is really just a dumb comedy, the only problem is that it isn't funny. It's the first day of high school and Harry, who previously has been home schooled by his mother, needs someone to show him the ropes. Lloyd, who lives in the school's basement with his adoptive dad/school custodian Ray, turns out to be just the guy. They unknowingly fall into the web of the corrupt Principal Collins and his girlfriend, head lunch lady Ms. Heller, who want them to be the first students in a phony \"special needs\" class in order to bilk $100,000 in grant money for themselves. Harry and Lloyd go out to look for more students for this new class, they catch the attention of Jessica Matthews, a hard-hitting reporter for the school's newspaper, who suspects foul play. The plot sounds like it has some potential but the execution is very bad. This has to be the most pointless film of 2003 and one of the least funniest as well. Most of the jokes just fall flat and apparently the filmmakers weren't trying at all. I can see now why Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels backed out of this one. They are replaced by Eric Christian Olsen and Derek Richardson. Derek and Eric both play their roles dumb, they just try to hard most of the time and aren't funny. Eugene Levy is embarrassingly bad and this has to be his worst film ever. Mimi Roger's role is small but its nice to see her on screen. She is also one of the few saving graces in this film. The rest of the cast is mostly unfunny except for Bob Saget who does have some funny moments. Troy Miller does a poor job of directing and writing as he didn't seem to really put a lot effort in. People are defending this film, saying that you can't take every film seriously. I wasn't taking this film seriously and it still wasn't very funny. There might had been a laugh here or there but that's it. The original was fine and didn't need a prequel to explain what happened before and this film just ruins the original. The running time is also a good thing as its only 82 minutes long though sometimes it feels longer. Is this film better then the original? No, not even close and this comedy should be forgotten. In the end, this film is not worth the time or money to watch and its better if you just skip this. Rating 3.3/10, rent the original instead.",

The film is an embarrassing and absurd mess , the plot is ridiculous and monotonous and is formed by several humor set pieces , being quite disagreeable and graceless . There are some steamy hot scenes and some memorable and hilarious happenings of dirty humor which will rejoice the rogue aficionados to these kinds of things . Neither the players , nor the filmmaking seem to be nice , and the storyline is utterly embarrassing , but , curiously , it has some amusing moments and I found myself laughing in some times of the movie . Eric Christian Olsen was repeatedly denied the role of Lloyd because the producers thought he was \"too good-looking\" . It was only after seeing some home-video footage of Eric in full make-up improvising a scene with already-cast Derek Richardson that they gave him the role . The cast secondary is pretty good , such as : Luis Guzm\u00e1n , Rachel Nichols , Eugene Levy , William Lee Scott , Shia Labeouf , Bob Saget , Julia Duffy and Mimi Rogers . Lin Shaye was the only cast member to star in both the original Dumb and Dumber and the sequel .

I had heard that it was bad, but I figured, \"reviewers are wrong all the time, and besides I loved Dumb and Dumber.\"Dumb and Dumberer is set back in the 1980's when Harry and Lloyd first meet eachother.  Step 1: If your going to make a movie set in the 80's don't be waving around NEW five dollar bills.  Step 2: Why ruin the first movie by making a dispicable prequel.This movies humor is very much 2nd Grade.  If you get a kick at of hearing Bob Saget say SH*T a billion time's then sure go watch this movie. Another that made me mad was how really dumb they were.  At least in Dumb and Dumber they had some sense of common sense.  In the prequel there is not one inkling of common sense.  It almost makes you want to hurt yourself over how dumb they are.The only good thing about this movie was Eugene Levy.  As always he was histerical.  Without him this movie would have been 2 inexperienced actors, literally walking around like a bunch of retards.Bottom line: F+ (with out Eugene Levy) F",

The title sums it up and you really shouldn't expect anything other than rubbish when you sit down to watch it.That said, I am surprised to see it in the bottom 100 of IMDb's lists. It is bad, but I'm sure there are many films far above it that deserve its place at the bottom much, much more.Dumb and Dumberer could never hope to compete with its predecessor but its no worse really than any other teen-comedy-high-school nonsense. If the original movie had not been made, then this one wouldn't have gotten anywhere near the bad press it has. But, alas, it was not to be, and so this film will slip into obscurity like many ill-conceived sequels, destined to be forgotten, or talked about with ill-disguised scorn when reminiscing over the original movie.The best way to watch this film (if you have to at all) is to try and forget the characters Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels made their own, and view it as if that first film had never happened. Also, console yourself whilst watching that there are a few bloopers tacked onto the end that are the comedic highlight of this unfunny movie, although its really not worth watching the film just for them. You might then get some enjoyment out of an otherwise bland film.In summary then, its bad but not really deserving a place in the worst 100 of IMDb.",

Thusly I figured it wouldn't take much to meet my relatively low expectations for it. After all, the first one was pretty funny, right?Before I continue, it should be noted that this movie had none of the original cast members, writers, directors, etc from the first film.No one, at least, worth noting.Now, back to the story. Where the first movie had laughs galore (most of them cheap lowbrow humor, but hey, if I want Shakespeare, I'll read Shakespeare...) this movie had a sprinkling of \"That's kinda funny...\" and \"Was that funny? I can't tell anymore...\" moments.The most telling thing I can say about this movie is that I DIDN'T FINISH IT. Nay, I COULDN'T finish it.A friend of mine that had the misfortune of being in the room with me at the time said it best when he said: \"At one point I laughed at how painfully unfunny it was and I realized that it (the movie) had pulled me down to it's level.\"Of course he also said: \"Another reason dumb and dumbrererererrer sucked is that both guys were trying to cop Betty White's \"Rose\" character from the Golden Girls but neither of them possesses her panache or supple buttocks.\"Verily, it is a thing of evil.Having said that, it's not the worst movie I've ever seen. I would have to give some thought to exactly which movie holds that dishonor. \"Batman and Robin\" is pretty close. But no, I've actually finished worse movies than this. Thing is, in those movies I held out hope that they would get better before the end. With Dumb and Dumberer, there was no such hope. In fact, there was utterly no hope at all.I did get a chuckle from a couple moments though. Like when the two titular characters walk down the school hallway with their Special Ed class to the theme from the A-Team, and... well, that's it actually.Oh yeah, Mimi Rogers made out with a little hottie named Rachel Nichols.The most notable thing about Nichols, other than her being very attractive, is that she's in the new Bruce Campbell film \"The Woods\" which is currently in post production.Apart from that \"Dumb and Dumberer\" can be summed up by the fact that I actually got up off my couch to remove this ultra-boring, ultra-unfunny piece of cinematic spam from the DVD player.PS: I did put it back in to check the not-so 'Special Features', but I did not find the apology I was looking for.Maybe it's an 'Easter Egg'.I don't recommend checking yourselves, but if someone finds it, please let me know. I feel it's owed to me.",

Only problem is, the guys in that movie looked pretty dumb but at the same time sympathetic, and you wanted good things to happen to them. The guys in this one look like they've just peed their pants. Like, all the time. The only direction the actors got must have been like, stare blankly into space and be loud and annoying and high-pitched.

            "content": "Want to hear something funny? I laughed at \"Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd.\" In fact, at about four scenes I was rolling over in laughter. And not just me -- people in front of and behind me were roaring in laughter, too.It's not a good movie. But I have seen far worse. Yes, the movie is filmed in the distinct style of a bad movie. It has a bad script. Most of its jokes are bad. It's essentially a bad movie. But it's not awful. And when I left, I had a smile on my face, because I had expected a depressing comedy and I got a goofy, good-natured one with a few good gags and a lot of good spirit. In its essence, it is quite easy to watch and -- perhaps -- just a little bit fun.I say this not out of prior prejudice, as much as I may have enjoyed the first installment, but out of surprise, because I expected it to give a bad name to the first film, \"Dumb and Dumber\" (1994). I read all the bad reviews before going into \"Dumb and Dumberer.\" I didn't expect to laugh a single minute time, and I expected it to be a pale imitation of its predecessor.I did laugh. Not much, but I did. And it's not a pale imitation of the first film--it isn't nearly as solid in direction (thanks to the absence of the Farrelly Brothers), but this is a good thing. I don't think it wanted to try to be like the first film, because it knew that it couldn't be and never would be. So it's just a sappy little 90-minute movie with a few good gags and a notably convincing portrayal of a younger Jim Carrey (or Lloyd Christmas) from Eric Christian Olsen. His face is often contorted with an arched eyebrow. To those who said he didn't look like Jim Carrey: Shame on you. He's even got the movements and physical gestures down pat.It's 1986. Lloyd (Olsen) lives with his stepfather (Luis Guzman), the local high school janitor. Rushing to catch the bus for school one day, he turns around a corner and (literally) bumps into Harry Dunne (Derek Richardson), a homeschooler whose first day of school begins on that very day. Lloyd gets his tooth chipped when they bump into each other and immediately they are best pals.As Lloyd shows Harry the ropes at school, Principal Collins (Eugene Levy) sets up a \"special needs\" program at the school as a way of cheating his way to a 100,000 dollar grant from a pay program, which -- unbeknownst to him -- is all just an FBI sting. The cafeteria cook (Chery Oteri), who is also Collins' lover, plays teacher to Harry, Lloyd and a band of other \"special\" kids. Meanwhile, Harry and Lloyd's friendship starts to blossom.You want to know the scene that had my hysterically laughing in this film? It's the most juvenile scene in the entire movie, and I know this, but it was great. Bob Saget (\"Full House\") plays the uptight father of Jessica, Harry's wannabe love interest. Invited to dinner at their house, Harry accidentally spreads melted chocolate all over the bathroom wall. After leaving, Saget walks in and sees it, completely freaks out, and starts to curse up a storm. Let's just say that he thinks it is something other than chocolate covering his bathroom.I cherish \"Dumb and Dumber,\" the original, because I find its buddies lovable and its goofiness contagious. I am a big fan of the buddy movie sub genre, specifically the Odd Couple stuff. \"Dumb and Dumberer\" is not in its league. It's too childish, too crude, too immature, too plain stupid. But y'know what? It sure is a lot dumber than the first film. Perhaps even dumberer. Like I said above, after reading the negative press about this film I really expected a shameless cash-in on the original. In a way, that's what I got. But I admire this film's spirit. It knows it's nothing great. And it didn't harm me, despite all its crude humor and childish jokes. In a way, it's almost admirable because the director, Troy Miller, managed to create a film that plastered a goofy little grin on my face without disgusting me like \"Daddy Day Care\" did, a \"family\" comedy minus the laughs. This one works, in an odd sort of way. And, for once, a film title lives up to its name. This movie is certainly dumberer than the first.Note: I seem to be praising this film. I'm not. It is merely a mediocre comedy. I withhold its flaws in my review specifically because it surprised me very much and, despite being an undoubtedly bad movie, I don't necessarily find it harmful in any way, shape or form. It's a goofy little comedy with a smaller heart than the first but a heart nevertheless. I give it a bad rating because it trips more than it succeeds. But I will add a disclaimer to this review: It's not as bad as you think...and you may be surprised. This film puts a small little smile on your face.",

There were flashes of comedic brilliance throughout the movie making it very reminiscent of its predecessor, but there were just too many weak points. I think the weakness came from the lack of a fixed goal for Harry and Lloyd. In Dumb and Dumber you knew that their purpose was to deliver a briefcase to a woman in Aspen Colorado, so no matter what happened throughout the movie you knew what they were trying to accomplish. In Dumb and Dumberer they don't have a similar fixed goal.The movie was not worth my $8 but it was good enough for an average rating, nothing less.",

Of course, the misfits win, but tyro scribe Robert Brenner and Miller don't pull off anything as imaginative as the Farrelly brother did. The most grotesque scene has poor Harry at his girlfriend's house with feces all over himself and Jessica's father Bob Saget of \"America's Funniest Home Videos\" howling in agony. The funniest scene is the opener when Harry is born and we see life from his perspective looking out of his mom's womb. Naturally, Harry wants nothing to do with life and refuses to accommodate the pediatrician. The biggest future star who is cast as one of the misfits that gravitate toward Lloyd and Harry is none other than \"Transformers'\" star Shia LaBeouf. Happily, Eric Christian Olsen, who does resemble what a young Lloyd might look like, went on to better things in the CBS-TV \"NCIS Los Angeles.\" Writer & director Miller puts our harebrained heroes through their paces, but we don't feel for them like we felt for their grown-up counterparts. \"Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd\" didn't make enough bucks at the box office and the \"Dumb and Dumber\" franchise would languish another eleven years before the Farrelly brothers revived it. Only completists will want to waste their time on this nonsense. Several bigger names are lost in the mishmash, among them Luis Guzman was Lloyd's janitor father. For the record, the Felcher twins show up at the end.",

This movie thankfully, is not as GROSS as Me, Myself & Irene, that movie was much worse than this. I just think trying to make another film connecting to the original (Dumb & Dumber) which I have to admit was a lot funnier than this. I gave that movie a \"7\". But this is just DUMB. The humor is sort of crude but it's not too too bad, but it's not funny either. I have to say this was not what I expected it to be. I expected it to be good but I was wrong. After watching it repeatedly I could already guess the user rating it has. (3.3/10) Even though this film is not obscene well, at least not really,it just has to be a waste. I mean in this film their stupider than they are in the other one, and plus they're not even funny. They're just plain stupid. Don't waste your on this film, buy the first one.

            "content": "One of those films that will astound you in that it actually got made. The script and direction here are poor and some of the 'comedic' performances are non-existent. But then again dialogue wise nobody has really anything to work with. The first film was made on the basis of a strong script. This sorry mess is made simply on the basis of a 'good' idea (that being lets cash in on the first one).The studio probably commissioned this after seeing only a treatment or maybe even just a pitch which probably went something like \"Dumb and Dumber made a lot of money. Lets make another one\". If that's the case then they should have got some performers who are good at improvisation but alas.To the film itself.....the leads do a good impersonation of Carey and Daniels but lack the comedic flair and material. It must have been a tough job I admit but the Loyd Christmas character struggles to get any laughs at all. The Harry take-off fairs better though. The one scene in the film which had me laughing was set in the school babe's house when she invites Harry round for dinner. But this was about the only one which had the whole audience, or indeed even part of it, going. It involved some pretty base toilet humour but in this movie you take the chuckles where you can. As for the plot. What can I say?! Its a prequel to the aforementioned original set during the terrible twosome's school years. And really that's about as much info as you need in terms of the character's motivations.In regards to the other more notable cast members present here Eugene Levy stole the show in 'American Pie' but most of his scenes here stink of being painfully under-written. He almost looks embarrassed to be in it. Also the rest of the kids in the special needs class just ain't funny. For a start they don't actually do anything and when they do get screen time they are about as charismatic as a career stoner. And when we find out that the Asian foreign exchange student is actually American the general reaction is not laughter but more wondering 'Who is she again?' I don't know why Mimi Rogers and Luis Guzman are in this. Their roles are small and uninteresting. I think that's meant to be the joke. Ha, Ha. Also that Loyd's dad(Guzman) is an Hispanic for some unexplained reason. Wacky! The role that must get the most criticism though is that of the store clerk. This guy's timing and general acting, if you could call it that, are just terrible. He stinks the house out . I can only imagine that they found him on the street and were unlucky to uncover America's worst performer. I mean what kind of audition , if any, did he go through for this? He has a gratingly monotone voice and a face you would like to hit.In summary: you can see 90% of the laughs coming and when they do come they ain't funny; the ending has huge plot holes in it that are never explained(I know. I may have taken it a bit too seriously) and even the out-takes struggle to raise a snigger. The film has the same poor pacing and direction of 'Dude.Where's my car?' but is even less funny than that piece of $h!t. 3/10",

            "content": "Going into this film, I thought it would be a little risky to make a prequel to a film entitled Dumb and Dumber; especially with the gap between films a whole nine years. The reason I thought it'd be risky is because the recent spate of sequels, prequels, remakes and so forth hasn't exactly been a success story so another helping to two misfits in their younger years in a film entitled Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd could've been a disaster.It's probably been said before but few films actually come close to having their titles describe them - Dumb and Dumberer does this. Some other films that have done so could include Scary Movie (although that wasn't too scary) and Epic Movie (although by sounds of things, that wasn't too epic). One thing all these films have in common in the long run is that they're all failed comedies. Dumb and Dumberer isn't just a failed comedy; it's an insult to a number of things, one of which is us, the viewers. The reoccurring joke in Dumb and Dumberer is that of the mocking of people with disabilities or special needs. People who find it difficult to learn at the same speed or are 'below' the average when it comes to day to day skills are the overall butt of jokes in Dumb and Dumberer and it's difficult to watch at times. This is probably Dumb and Dumberer's biggest error.It's not just people with disabilities that are targeted but they do get a pretty rough time. One person thinks Marco Polo invented the swimming pool; he also thinks George Washington invented money since the guy's face is all over it. But no: the crippled, the foreign and women in general are targeted in such a way; even mildly smirking at it could be considered a crime. A Chinese girl doesn't speak much English: she's special; a guy with a broken arm is useless: he's special and the way the women (the mother character, the female student Jessica and Principal Collins' (Levy) scenes with Ms. Heller (Oteri)) are treated is extremely disrespectful and sexist. Jessica (Nichols) is put across as a prize to be won but it later turns out she has a boyfriend and merely runs off to him whenever the situation calls for it, Ching Chong (Krusiec) despite having a ridiculous name eventually tells everyone she can speak English (why she kept it a secret, I don't know) but goes right back to submissive, dumb Chinese girl who \"don't speekee Inglish\" on a male's demand.The film also lacks any sort of a story and thus; doesn't have that much conflict, it's just making fun of these different groups. Whatever conflict there is, is so watered down and weak, it's incredible. The Principal and a teacher want to stiff the school and its special needs department just so they can run off together to Hawaii; that's it. They conduct this evil scheme that just isn't really that evil; we realise they're not likable people but because you have no caring towards the people they're trying to stiff you don't really care. Although one or two situations arise that are funny such as the melted chocolate scene and the window exchange scene where Lloyd transports a convocation to Jessica through Harry who's actually talking to a stray dog, the bulk of the humour is either unfunny slapstick or of the racist/sexist/disabilities mocking variety.I wasn't really engaged by the film in fact I felt sorry for Harry and Lloyd more than anything and wanted them to succeed through pity than anything else. I really liked the way Derek Richardson and Eric Christian Olsen were made to look like Carrey and Daniels from the first film \u0096 that was impressive but this is real borderline trash with no laughs and pretty damned offensive material which will only encourage children to act against foreign people, girls and people with disabilities in a negative way should they see it.",

The only funny thing about the film is the presence of Bob Saget, who plays the stuffy, put-upon father of the love interest that Lloyd and Harry both have eyes for and his character hates any form of fecal matter.

This prequel, on the other hand, released nine years later, which the Farrelly brothers did not write or direct, turned out to be a flop. While it seems that \"Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd\" is generally considered terrible, I don't think it is, but it's certainly no match for its predecessor.Harry Dunne is born in 1969, and as he grows up, he is home-schooled by his mother until one year in high school, in the 1980s. This is when his mother finally sends him to regular school. After this happens, he soon meets one of his peers, Lloyd Christmas, and they soon become two very dimwitted friends. Ms. Heller, the school lunch lady, gets Harry and Lloyd to gather some students for a \"special needs\" class, which they will also be in. However, the two pals have no clue that this is all a scam hatched by Ms. Heller and Principal Collins to cheat the school out of enough money to buy a condo in Waikiki! Jessica, a girl that Harry and Lloyd know, however, is suspicious! You might think I'm crazy for saying this, but watching \"Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd\" wasn't a completely laugh-free experience for me. I didn't laugh very much, but did at times, such as when Harry is at Jessica's house and gets chocolate all over the bathroom, causing her dad to throw a fit when he sees it, thinking it's feces (yes, that is very immature, it still made me laugh, I can't deny that)! There were also times when I just smiled. However, for the most part, I didn't think it was funny. The last time I watched \"Dumb & Dumber\", I think I had a smile on my face as I started watching, knowing what I was in for, but that wasn't the case with this sequel. Also, the two famous main characters are just not the same.When a movie is as poorly received as this one turned out to be, I usually understand. I wouldn't say I like \"Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd\" too much, my 5/10 rating makes that clear, but the fact that it has gotten more 1/10 votes than any others still makes me feel that I mustn't have seen the same movie. I might even be able to give this movie a 6/10. I guess I'm in the minority of viewers who weren't absolutely disgusted by this 2003 flop, but I still don't think it's really that good overall. I wouldn't say it should be avoided like the plague, but since many others would, you might want to do so, I just don't know.",

The two individuals are seen by many as 'special', and become best friends as soon as they meet. Principal Collins and his lover, the lunch lady, Ms. Heller want to make as much money out of scams, and their next idea is to create a special needs class. Ms. Heller is the teacher, and they have assigned Harry and Lloyd to round the special students up. School News Reporter Jessica is suspicious though, and desperately tries to find out the truth, even if it means gaining Harry and Lloyd's help.OK, where do i start? If you was a huge fan of 'Dumb and Dumber' then i advise you to stay clear from this. If you liked the original, and is just interested in what the prequel contains, then don't go into this viewing with high hopes. To sum up this film is one word, i would use 'bad'. Just plain bad. The main problem with this film is the jokes. There is a story but only a very basic story, and the jokes are focused on innuendos, which sounds as if they were written by 12 year old's. Although some of us might have been 12 when the original film came out, we would definitely not be 12 now. Innuendos jokes just does not make a film good, especially when the innuendos jokes aren't even that good. The acting is OK. There impersonations of Harry and Lloyd are not exactly perfect, but they do a good job. The rest of the cast are OK. Seeing Eugene Levy and Cheri Oteri in a scene together, did actually make me chuckle a little, but Eugene Levy should have known better to pick a role like this. There are the few other good appearances from stars such as Shia LaBeouf, Mimi Rogers and Lin Shaye. Still, if i was you, i would only watch it for the performance of a specific actor.\"Come on out, you little b******.\" - Doctor (Timothy Stack)",

Due to their tremendously stupid behaviour they are put in a special education class that the school's principal Collins (Eugene Levy) has created in order to embezzle the money meant for advancing the special students' rights. The shady actions of the principal are being investigated by a smart but good-looking student named Jessica (Rachel Nichols), who also evokes feelings in both Harry and Lloyd.As Dumb and Dumberer is a prequel, it's only natural that neither Jim Carrey nor Jeff Daniels of the original movie reprises their roles. Instead, Richardson and Olsen try to emulate the original actors' styles, but since they haven't got the natural aura of comedy like Carrey and Daniels do, the result is just painfully unfunny. Both protagonists, especially Harry, are essentially retards whose constant yelling and bantering is nothing but irritating. Olsen's attempts of capturing Carrey's trademark facial expressions are probably the best thing about the performances, but that is a very, very faint praise. One can only wonder how a talented supporting actor like Luis Guzm\u00e1n ended up in a movie like this.As opposed to the road trip theme of Dumb & Dumber, the jokes in the prequel are largely based on tired high school stereotypes, so it must have been difficult to come up with anything we haven't already seen many times, if the writers ever even tried to achieve anything that ambitious. Plenty of sex jokes and toilet humour are also present, and while one gross-out scene actually is funny, the premise of the joke is essentially recycled from the first movie, raising even more questions about the point of this movie's existence. In addition, the film comes across as mocking and mean-spirited towards real-life special education students. As not even the blooper reel over the end credits is funny, Dumb and Dumberer seriously cannot be recommended to anyone but the most undemanding of comedy fans, if even them. The rest of us should just avoid it altogether.",

The genius of the Farrelly Brothers' characters is that, while not particularly bright (and who doesn't know people like that?), Harry & Lloyd's friendship is both touching and funny. In this prequel, it is sad and disgraceful. This is too bad since so many obvious comedic talents are wasted - Eugene Levy, Cheri Oteri, and Bob Saget particularly (although it was a treat to hear squeaky-clean Saget screaming \"Sh*t!\" over and over - in outtakes he tries the word \"poop\" instead, but it isn't nearly as funny). When Harry Met Lloyd deserved so much better than this. I've often wished the Farrellys would make a sequel to \"Dumb and Dumber\". How about \"Dumbing Down\" - with Harry & Lloyd in Washington? Or should that be called \"Dumb and Dubya\"?",

I liked the original too.What you get with this movie is a script that is not funny and young actors doing impressions of Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels.I was really tested to make it threw the movie.  And I failed.  Just couldn't do it.  I made it 45 minutes.Lucky me for not renting this movie - my step-son did and i burrowed it.  I asked my stepson before watching this one what he thought and he said it was ok but not funny.  Should have gotten the clue.After watching the first 45 minutes I said ENOUGH and decided to watch the extra features.  I'd get more background on why this movie was made and get clips of the parts I didn't watch.  The funniest parts were supposed to be in the beginning - of which I saw and didn't laugh.  A part where both characters play tag in a 7-11 type store and those same characters drinking a slurpee and getting brain freeze.  Horrible, Horrible, Horrible.  What has become of todays comedy?  It's all about cheap humor and is so unoriginal.So back to the extra features, the people who made this movie in the extra features acted like they had somekind of comedic masterpiece here.  They say they were looking for people who were funny and just didn't do impressions. Well all you get here is impersonations that were not funny.I've wasted enough time here on this one.  My review is to hopefully save others from watching this.  Please, don't even rent this one if you know what is good for you - it's in the bottom 100 for a reason.  That's it - goal achieved.",

            "content": "First off, I have to say that Dumb and Dumber is one of my all-time favorite films.  I've seen it countless times and it's just as funny as it was the day I first saw it.  That being said, I was delighted to hear that a prequel was going into development in late 2002.  The fact that Carrey and Daniels were not returning was a bit upsetting at first, but the fact that it takes place in 1986 would just make them feel out of place and I was more than willing to give new actors a chance.  After the official trailer, people bashed the flick relentlessly, vowing never to watch it because it looked like pure s*** and nothing more.  I, on the hand, couldn't wait until June 13th.I was there opening day, and I have to say this is, hands down, the funniest film I've seen in a long time.  There were a few nods and references to the original, and Derek Richardson and Eric Olsen really perfected the parts of Harry and Lloyd.  Everyone seemed to love the Bob Saget cameo, myself included.  Funny, funny stuff.There were a couple of major problems, however.  First of all, there are anachronistic errors littered throughout, the music being the most distracting.  Artists like Vanilla Ice and Good Charlotte certainly were not around in '86.  Another problem is the editing.  Test audiences weren't big fans of this film, as it was trimmed down from 115 minutes to 82 minutes. Luis Guzman and Mimi Rogers had decent-sized roles, but in the final product their presence was just about wasted.  They even went as far as to delete a musical number and scenes from Lloyd's childhood (i.e. how he eventually came to live with Ray).But, despite being historically incorrect and having major editing issues, the film was still full of laughs and ends up being an enjoyable way to spend an hour and twenty minutes.",

So after having seen the first one, you gotta go see the sequel, and the movie executives know this. They knew that just the title alone would fill a lot of seats, and they made absolutely no effort to make a decent movie.Throughout the movie I sat there. The lady I was with wanted to walk out. I paid $7 for myself and another $7 for her, and I'll be doggoned if I wasn't going to get at least one laugh out of it. I sat through the whole movie hoping that I would get at least a chuckle. After the first few minutes I knew I wasn't going to get a laugh worth $14, but I at least wanted something for that kind of bread. I didn't get it. I never laughed once.

            "content": "It is very strange that when I read the user reviews of this site, so few actually talk about why the movie is so bad. Well, I'd like to take a moment to say why I didn't, and in better detail than most, hopefully, enjoy the movie.Dumb and Dumberer is a prequel, which if the word \"sequel\" is of any indication, means it is a continuation from the first. Well, \"Prequel\" implies it as a \"beginning of\" story, sort of what happened in the childhoods of Harry and Lloyd, who were originally played by Jeff Daniels and Jim Carrey, respectively.The characters in the story are Harry and Lloyd, two simple minded teenagers, who lack any real charm or clever idiocy that was played so well in the original. The idea in this movie is that the principal, played by the legendary Eugene Levy (Jim's Dad in American Pie and most of its sequels) is trying to find a get rich quick scheme, so he develops a special needs class to make the money, but he needs students.If that part of the plot doesn't offend you, don't worry, the rest will.Harry and Lloyd go on a search to find kids who are just like them, (although its so insulting to think special needs kids can't tell an Asian girl from a mentally handicapped child) and needless to say, a class is formed.Jessica, a very smart teenage girl (which only implies the entire school isn't smart enough to recognize this plot) sees the ruse, and uses our heroes to dig up the dirt on the principal.To be honest, if the movie didn't have the \"Dumb and Dumber\" moniker or even a mentioning of Harry and Lloyd, this movie probably would have faded into obscurity, nary, even been made, and if it did, it might have been a cult classic if it had been better written and not as relying on the first movie's jokes.The movie has some references to the original picture, but the problem is that references aren't usually funny. So when this movie references the laxative from the original as a large truck carrying said product, it doesn't make it funny, you are just implying that you watched the movie enough to notice it.The problem with this movie is just lazy writing. The creators probably thought watching enough of the original was a good idea to create a sequel, but what it does is insult anyone who tries really hard to write good comedy with insulting retreads from classic movies.Harry and Lloyd aren't some kind of smart, they are all kinds of moron. In the original, it is implied they aren't smart, but in reality, it's that their ideas of intelligence is slightly askew from most people, but it was mostly honest mistakes. Lloyd hearing the country Austria and playing it off as Australia is believable, and more than likely a mistake a person has made before, as opposed to say, talking about who Benjamin Franklin is (Where Lloyd explains that Ben Franklin was the \"Pilgrim who invented Penicillin and defeated Godzilla\").Critics and most writers will tell you that was is usually funny isn't funny, it's what you play off as serious that's funny. The characters aren't serious people doing funny things, they are played off as funny people doing funny things, and that doesn't always equal funny.The actors seem rather detached from the project, as if they all simultaneously had a large bill to pay, so they played their appropriate roles just to pay it off to do better movies. It was strange that from the years 2003 and 2005, people thought that making sequels to previous Jim Carrey movies was to be cinematic gold, was actually just copper painted up and advertised as gold.It is always going to be argued that sequels are never better than their original counterparts, and that's understandable, only so many movies have that bragging right. That doesn't mean if you have an idea for a sequel and you feel strongly in making a sequel that you have to do it poorly in every means possible: in writing, in acting, in character development, music, staffing, ETC. It should be room to improve. A sequel, in particular, a prequel should challenge the audience to see how the characters became who they are when we remember them, not putting them in a less than original story.This concludes my review, I give it a 2/10.",

The jokes here are almost funny, but suffer the Nutty Professor 2 phenomenon.  They are pretty much the same as the first one, with a few twists to make them seem interesting.  For instance, remember that hilarious scene when Harry gets diarrhea at Lauren Holly's character's house, and then she tells him that the toilet is broken?  Well there is one such scene in this movie, only this time Harry buys Jessica a chocolate bar before he goes to her house, only to have it melt in his pocket, which of course he sticks his hand inside of and proceeds to smear brown goop all over the bathroom walls.  Her father, played by Bob Saget, becomes infuriated.  So, if you've seen the first one, there's no need to see the second.  Many of the same jokes were used in the second Nutty Professor, much like the sequel to Dumb and Dumber.  And why did it have to be about when Harry and Lloyd met?  Teen movies suck, and Harry and Lloyd's further adventures would've been more interesting.  The only good thing I can think about this movie would be the fact that the actors portraying Daniel's and Carey's characters actually looked like them (had they been 15 years younger).  This movie was kind of a waste of my time, but then again I wasn't doing anything constructive at the time anyway.",

Admittedly, I was 12 at the time, but have seen it more recently in my adult years and was still highly entertained.So I was looking forward to this.  The trailer promised more of the mindless action provided by the first film and the characters Harry and Lloyd looked well cast.That was where the positives ended really.  As well cast as Harry and Lloyd were - Eric Christian Olsen was excellent and true to Jim Carrey's original portrayl of Lloyd - there is nothing they could do to rescue a diabolical script and storyline.Part of the humour of the first was that only Harry and Lloyd were that ridiculously idiotic.  They were misunderstood by a believable world. This was part of the strength of the first, which allowed for an excellent story line and some near-water inducing situations.  But such clever circumstances are left well behind in this prequel.Everybody is an idiot in this movie and that immediately impacts on the humour potential.  If anything, the poor and corny quips from the supporting cast detract from the movie.  Ms. Heller (Cheri Oteri) comes across as even more stupid than the two main characters.  Such ridiculous but plot-centric concepts as Principal Collins (Eugene Levy) keeping all the evidence of his crimes, needed to bury him in jail for life, baffle the mind for their awful stupidity.  Even the funnier moments wear out quickly - somebody can only think chocolate is poo for so long.Perhaps I'm doing this movie a disservice, but I'm not.  There are a few laughs, however they are few and far between.  The plot is substandard. There are none of the classic settings, for Lloyd and Harry to create carnage in, that were in abundance in the first movie.  The directing is poor and misses many things (like the 90s cars and songs in a movie set in 1986).This calamity of a prequel is no fault of the actors.  Most of the major characters do as well as could be expected with what is just a lame script. Even the end of movie 'girls in need' part is pathetic.This movie was abysmal.  The only reason it gets above a 0 is because Harry and Lloyd were well portrayed and managed to provide an occasional laugh despite the script/director's best attempts.  You'd have to be seriously devoid of comedy in your life to find this movie funny.It just doesn't belong in the same video store as the original. 1/5.",

Every successful movie must have a sequel it seems, and sometimes even not-so-successful movies get their share. Next to remakes, lame sequels is one of the worst things i know.Right from the start it's obvious that this movie has absolutely nothing to offer in way of comedy. I read in the trivia that most of the cast were chosen on the grounds that they were \"huge Dumb & Dumber fans\". I'm not surprised. This movie is simply put what you get if you lock a bunch of talentless retards in a room and loop Dumb & Dumber. We have a duo of \"actors\" (and i use the term loosely here) acting the parts Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels had in the original. And watching them act is like seeing 10-year old kids in front of a mirror making faces and trying desperately to sound like their idols. Sure i have a laugh with my friends quoting movies, sure i sometimes say \"Like a glove!\" to myself when i park the car trying to sound like Jim Carrey... Most people do stuff like this. Most people however don't record it on film and try to sell it as a sequel to their favorite movies! Of course the biggest flaw is still not the crappy actors or the complete lack of comedy in both script and acting. Rather it's the complete lack of understanding for what made the first movie such a success. I know a lot of people who loathe silly comedy who still like \"Dumb & Dumber\". Why? Because the Farrelly brothers have an uncanny sense when it comes to making their oddball characters lovable in a strange way. There is a warmth in the portrayal even when they are at their most pathetic (or even twisted). Of course that is completely missing here, just like everything else that makes a movie good...Even though expectations were abysmally low this movie still managed to put them to shame.

These two wannabes just try TOO hard to be in their predecessors shoes. But they don't fit in at all.Again, i repeat, AVOID AT ALL COSTS!Good thing i didn't waste much of my time watching this movie neither did i waste my money on it.

            "content": "If you are a big fan of the original Farrelly Brothers comedy with the fantastic performances by Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels, then many people were probably questioning why they did not do a sequel with the same stars, and instead opted for a prequel with new ones, from director Troy Miller (Jack Frost). Basically it is 1986, and the moment when teenagers home schooled Harry Dunne (Hostel's Derek Richardson) and Lloyd Christmas (The Hot Chick's Eric Christian Olsen) who is the adopted son of high school janitor Ray (Luis Guzm\u00e1n), the same high school Harry is being transferred to. They bump into each other, and Lloyd chips his tooth in the process, and they instantly become friends, as if it was destiny, and Harry's mother (Mimi Rogers) said there is a treasure hidden in the school, and he has the map, so this is something they can both aspire to find. Meanwhile Principal Collins (Eugene Levy) is looking for a way to make loads of money in order to get a condo, and seeing the two boys as very stupid and vulnerable he decides to create a fake \"special needs\" class in order to swindle thousands of dollars. While Harry and Lloyd think this class is for \"special people\", i.e. will go on to great things, obviously it is the other kind of \"special\" being referred, and it is their job to get other students to join the class. The students that do accept their place into the \"special needs\" class are just taking advantage in the fact that they do not have to learn much, including bully Turk (Elden Henson) who they believe to be a best friend, Toby (Josh Braaten) with a broken leg they mistake as a cripple, Toby's girlfriend Terri (Teal Redmann), geeky Lewis (Shia LaBeouf) who constantly changes costumes and they believe is a magical being, Turk's girlfriend and Asian exchange student Cindy aka Ching Chong (Michelle Krusiec), and badly injured football player Carl (William Lee Scott). As time goes by Jessica (Rachel Nichols) realises the Principal might be up to something and that the \"special needs\" class may in fact be a scam, and Harry and Lloyd have her talking to them, but they just think she is flirting with them with her knowledgeable talk. They do have a fight because of her, but they make up eventually, and decide that they should try and find the \"missing treasure\", and they mistake a chest containing scam evidence inside it as that treasure. Principal Collins is caught out when at a public President's Day parade, the Special Needs class make a float and the speakers on it play loudly the Principal's confession about the scam, Jessica is found by the pair to have a boyfriend, and the end sees Harry and Lloyd remaining friends, but also approached by the Felcher twins (Julia and Chandra Costello) (remember the first film Harry knew that Lloyd got with Freda Felcher). Also starring Cheri Oteri as Ms. Heller and Bob Saget as Jessica's Dad. Olsen and Richardson do look very similar to the original actors and do a moderately good job being just as stupid as previously seen, if not more so on a less funny scale at times, well, in fact the whole film is less funny it tries pointless to cash in on the teen market, the jokes are sometimes maybe too over the top, and overall it is a prequel hardly worth watching, a silly comedy. It was nominated the Razzies for Worst Screenplay, Worst Screen Couple for Olsen and Richardson and Worst Remake or Sequel. Adequate!",

The acting is terrible, the plot is horrendously absurd and predictable, and it is just not uplifting to watch. Probably the absolute worst aspect of this movie is how it tries to be funny. I'm not kidding when I say that Harry and Lloyd produce absolutely no humorous line, joke, or action in this entire film. If there was one god-forsaken reason to watch this movie, it could be either that you are under six years old, enjoy Eugene Levy's acting abilities, or are stoned out of your mind. Other than that, there is no point in viewing this movie, which should have never been made, and should have absolutely no connections to the fabulous \"Dumb and Dumber.\" Please, join my quest in getting this terrible movie back into the bottom 100, where it should achieve its rightful #1 spot some day soon.",

Usually this incorporation was either wrong or poorly timed. Granted the one good line from the film \"Chicks are for fags\" is kinda funny, they tried to use it twice, since there were so few other lines that were memorable. Maybe the next best line was Bob Sagget's tirade of \"You got poo all over my car\" and \"You got poo all over my bathroom.\"As a huge fan of the first film, I am glad I saw this film, but it was so bad that I had to come home and watch the original another time to make up for it.I don't plan on buying this film on DVD, but I will probably watch it again when it comes on cable.If you do need to see this film, see it at the matinee, at least save yourself a few bucks.The best thing about it was Eric Christian Olsen.

For me, the original had a special place in my childhood, I've seen in many times since, and I still consider it to be the Farrelly Brothers' best work to date.  Now here is a prequel (the execs probably thought, hey Lucas can do it, how hard can it be) and I think that, if anything else, it is an extremely pale retread/imitation of the original material.  I'm not saying the movie is entirely laughless, in fact there were a few moments when I had a chuckle or two or some grins at the reckless ingenuity of the characters' stupidity (there's even one laugh out loud moment inside the \"Special-Needs\" classroom involving a quiet jock when he gets riled up by the other students).  The problem lies in that any of the \"original\" jokes or gags have been done in so many other movies it can only be amusing after a while to the most slight of minds...which means that it will at least earn back a little of the money it took to make it.  In other words, Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd is precisely for it's target group, and it doesn't aim for anything more or audacious like the original, and there's only a minor curiosity to see these two knuckleheads portray younger versions of Carrey and Lloyd.  I didn't hate it, but when I left I wanted at least half of a refund.  D+",

So sitting down to watch it i was expecting the worse, but i was delightfully surprised when i found out this movie is actually good. Pretty much all the jokes are funny and there really isn't any sort of lull in the film, like the first one had. The story is simple and the characters are great.  All the performances are really great, especially Eric Christian Olsen and Derek Richardson both a very good and pull off a young Harry and Lloyd very well, i found Richardson to get annoying after a while, but Olsen was dead on the entire movie, he is exactly how Jim Carrey used to be (before he left wacky comedies to do more dramas)This kid could be Carrey's son, and could probably pull off young versions of Ace Ventura and The Mask. I predict you'll be seeing more of Mr. Olsen in the future.  The other actors in the film were also very good, but the one that stood out most was Eugine Levy, Man, is this guy hillarious or what, just seeing him makes me want to laugh, and he's particularly effective as the principal in the film.So basically this isn't the greatest film ever made, but its also not the worst. It does what it sets out to do, which is to provide a few laughs for an hour and a half.  If you loved the first then you should for sure check this one out7/10 stars",

I entered the theater with a highly skeptical attitude toward this prequel to a classic movie that I love for its total randomness, stupid hilarity and countless other details Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels brought to the part. The movie began with some of the most terrifically horrible ads I've ever seen in my life, and I was losing hope for this movie rapidly if this was how they were going to front the audience before playing it. And then it began...and I was extremely impressed! The actors sincerely looked and acted like teenage versions of they're predecessors, and as such a great on screen team the laughs never subsided when Lloyd and Harry were in the scene.I found only a few faults that would irritate the average movie-goer and criticizer of this movie, as they bugged me ever since I left the theater. One is that Lloyd, Jim Carrey's old part, is very controlling of Harry and is a 'jerk' the majority of the way through the movie, which really got on my nerves. In addition, Harry seemed too laid back and just let Lloyd treat him somewhat negatively. Also, there was almost no plot line! In the first 1994 movie there was an ultimate goal, a reason for the movie. In this prequel, there was one but it seemed as though New Line Cinema Stuck it in there just for spite. Thirdly, they didn't film it in the same way as the first! In Dumb and Dumber, every place the characters went, several funny things happened there that the viewer remembered later as the 'Cafe scene' or the 'beer scene'...In Dumb and DumberER, each clipping was significantly shorter, leaving the audience to figure out later what happened or why something occured, which is, in truth, an insanely poor movie-making technique that irritates.Besides those problems, however, and despite this movie being very different than its well-loved predecessor,it's hilarious! Many parts I found myself not able to breathe from laughing so hard, and maybe you need to be a teenager as I am to fully comprehend the jokes, but it was hilarious in its own way. This is a movie you'll want to take your crew of friends to and laugh at all the sickening stupidity and overall dumbererness of the first adventures, when Harry met Lloyd. I was impressed as it excelled past the standards I set for this flick, and maybe you will think so as well. Give it a try and go see it! An 8 out of 10 stars.

That film regarded a chance encounter about time and relationships but this idiotic prequel to Dumb and Dumber gives endless vulgarity about stupidity. Lame setup regards Harry and Lloyd taught at home before being sent to high school. The principal plans to extort money and needs a fake special education class to pull it off. Embarrassing climax at a parade with director Troy Miller showing no skill. He previously directed Jack Frost and his talent hasn't improved here. Example of this regards the kidnapped girl who suddenly appears in the conclusion, or the chocolate smeared about the washroom that is mistaken for crap. Can they not smell the difference? This can be credited as a moment in Bob Saget's career that he will likely regret. Eric Christian Olsen and Derek Richardson attempt to fill shoes too big for them. The idea of a narrating regarding their upbringing and first encounter might have worked in hands that didn't belong to Miller. Eugene Levy and Cheri Oteri are wasted as a principal and secretary out to scam their way through life. This film proved to be dumber when you have people who confuse chocolate for sh*t. This film is a perfect example of the latter. Score: 1 / 10",

Apparently the writers assumed that being stupid was funny.  Not so.  In the original movie, the humor came from being able to understand how someone might come to a certain conclusion if said person was increadibly dumb.  This movie, however, has no such logic.  For example, at the beginning of the original, Lloyd asks a girl where she is from, she replys Austria... which does sound a lot like Australia if you're an idiot, so Lloyd proceeds to talk to her making references to Australia... funny. In this latest crap calling itself a sequel, Lloyd passes a man in a car with a British lisence plate and accent.  Lloys yells out, \"Watch it Frenchie.\"  That's not funny, that's just wrong.  Not only did the movie make up it's own horrible jokes, it took perfectly good ones from the original and crapped all over them as well.  The plot was rediculous and there was nothing even remotely intelligent about it.  Say what you will about the characters, but the original Dumb and Dumber was a smart comedy. The only good thing I can say about this movie is the uncanny resemblance the one guy whos name I dont care to look up has to Jim Carrey.

            "content": "First off, I have to say that Dumb and Dumber is one of my all-time favorite films.  I've seen it countless times and it's just as funny as it was the day I first saw it.  That being said, I was delighted to hear that a prequel was going into development in late 2002.  The fact that Carrey and Daniels were not returning was a bit upsetting at first, but the fact that it takes place in 1986 would just make them feel out of place and I was more than willing to give new actors a chance.  After the official trailer, people bashed the flick relentlessly, vowing never to watch it because it looked like pure shit and nothing more.  I, on the hand, couldn't wait until June 13th.I was there opening day, and I have to say this is, hands down, the funniest film I've seen in a long time.  There were a few nods and references to the original, and Derek Richardson and Eric Olsen really perfected the parts of Harry and Lloyd.  Everyone seemed to love the Bob Saget cameo, myself included.  Funny, funny stuff.There were a couple of major problems, however.  First of all, there are anachronistic errors littered throughout, the music being the most distracting.  Artists like Vanilla Ice and Good Charlotte certainly were not around in '86.  Another problem is the editing.  Test audiences weren't big fans of this film, as it was trimmed down from 115 minutes to 82 minutes. Luis Guzman and Mimi Rogers had decent-sized roles, but in the final product their presence was just about wasted.  They even went as far as to delete a musical number and scenes from Lloyd's childhood (i.e. how he eventually came to live with Ray).But, despite being historically incorrect and having major editing issues, the film was still full of laughs and ends up being an enjoyable way to spend an hour and twenty minutes.",

Now this movie so good because the acting, the directing, and improvisation.

            "content": "Rhose Island, 1969. Harry Dunne (Derek Richardson)was born. It was so funny when he was about to be born, he bit the doctor. And the doctor said that Harry was a baby who liked to play hide and seek and he was a shy one! Eight years later, Harry had an imaginary friend named Captain Rob and the cops always had to save Rob from from the well in Harry's backyard! Ha! Ha! Ha! And ten years later, Harry's mother (Mimi Rogers) sent Harry and Rob on a treasure hunt. And that was, finding the school! Ha!Ha! Lloyd Christmas (Eric Christian Olsen), on the other hand was an adopted child and his father was a janitor of a school. And they together lived in the school.Lloyed and Harry eventually bumped into each other and Lloyd chipped his tooth when they both went around a corner. Harry was running away from a Rot Veiler and Lloyd, however, was looking for the when in fact, he was living in the school! Lloyd had a bully named Turk (Elden Henson) was sure was a real thug! And Lloyd also met a girl named Jessica Mathika (Rachel Nichols). Lloyd and Harry , however, attended special classes which were in the school's cafeteria and was run by the Lunch Lady, Ms.Heller (Cheri Oteri). And Lloyd and Harry had to find students who were \"special\" like them.Lloyd first got a boy with casts named Toby (Josh Braaten), Turk, Carl (William Lee Scott), who injured himself in a Football match, an exchange student named Ching Chong (Michelle Krusiec) and a half horse, half human boy named Lewis (Shia LaBoeuf). They were the \"Special Needs Class Of 1986\".They had a kiff bus. It was so hilarious when Jessica was chasing \"The Special Needs Bus\" because, she thought it special. And then, the bus went flying into the air in slow motion and inside, everyone was screaming in a decreased tone. And then , when Jessica went flying into the air, she landed with a thud! Ha!Ha!Ha! It was funny when Harry was spending time with Jessica at her house, Harry thought Jessica was making him hot when in fact , it was the heater which he was sitting on which it making him hot! And then, he went to the bathroom and when he removed his hand from his back pocket, and he sniffed his hand due to it being covered in a brown substance. It was chocolate! Mmm! That is something lovely to snack on when you needed to. And when he removed the rest of the chocolate from his back pocket, he threw it up into the air and, it went everywhere! And he wasn't able to clean it up! Lol.I was so charmed when Lloyd was talking to a dog when he was outside Jessica's home. And Harry repeated after him: \"Oh, I remember you. How could I forget those hairy nipples?!\" And then Jessica's father, Mr.Walter (Bob Saget) entered the room, he asked Jessica why Harry was talking to Jessica like that. And Jessica said, \"It's because he's special\". Lol! And then! Mr.Walter entered the bathroom and yelled how harry didn't know how to use a toilet when it just chocolate everywhere.Ha!Ha!Ha!It was hysterical to see Jessica take on Harry's mother. It was one of Lloyed's dreams about Harry's mom. And who would fall in love with Lloyd. And suddenly, Harry appeared and Harry was shocked to see it!! Lol! Another amusing moment was when Harry thought he found the treasure which he had been looking for all this time when in fact, it was a chest which belonged to Mr.Collins (Eugene Levy), the Headmaster of the school. Collins' chest had the scams. And soon, all the kids of \"The Special Class\" realized this was all a scam! So, to get Collins back, the gang created a huge version of Collins in pirate style and it spoke in Collins voice about his \"Grand Master Plan\". And it sure was the crime of the century! He was trying to make a run off with all the extra money he and Ms.Heller made with that \"Special Class\". The kids weren't even getting an education!Now, to end this review. I didn't mention all the other laughs in the movie because, they were all clich\u00e9s and I am sure you would recognize where they got the ending for the movie. But anyways, the film still was fun with style. And you could see that they were even worse when they were kids! Ha!Ha!Ha!",

            "content": "As others have already said here, perhaps one shouldn't grumble too much at Troy Miller's follow up to the original Dumb And Dumber (1994), as it is precisely what it says on the title. Almost a decade down the line since audiences were first introduced to the stupidities of Lloyd Christmas and Harry Dunne, the new film is sadly without benefit of the original stars Jim Carey and Jeff Daniels - who by this time presumably saw what was coming, and preferred to stick with better things. So Miller took the next best step of making the second installment a prequel, in which we get to see what happens when the loveable lunkheads first met back in 1986.The plot, such as it is, concerns the activities of the corrupt Principal of their High School and his eventual apprehension, partly through the investigative skills of Jessica (Rachel Nichols) a reporter on the school paper, as well as through the blunderings of the dumb duo. In fact the plot barely functions as more than something on which to hang the goonish activities of the two unlikely lads as they discover each other's unique intellectual charms, then meekly compete for the supposed affections of Jessica, and argue with each other. The Principal's current financial scam, intended to secure lucrative funding, is through the establishment of a special needs class of which Lloyd and Harry naturally are founder members. Outside of the gauche romance elements, much of the film is focused on the activities of this class as the various misfits are recruited by our two lads, then end up preparing a float for the procession that climaxes the film.In the hands of the Farrellys, Dumb And Dumberer might have made for an intriguing project, as those auteurs are often able to inject a degree of engagement into the most outrageous scenario. The inclusion here of the 'special needs' class recalls the other directors' humorous but sympathetic treatment of the handicapped. Miller, unfortunately, has none of the Farrellys' abilities to regenerate tired and questionable stereotypes. Despite the likeable gormlessness of Harry (Derek Richardson) and Lloyd (Eric Christian Olsen) in the main roles, his film mostly falls flat, with most of the humour either being too limp or too predictable to make much of an impact.Having said that, there are one or two moments that sparkle amongst the dross. Principal Collins' (Eugene Levy) early appearance, for instance -equipped with a Saddam-type moustache and haircut, the bumbling crook is at one point aptly framed against a poster background of minarets. Such subtle, visual comedy is rare in a film the main highlight of which otherwise is the unexpected lesbian kiss by the delectable Jessica - which, for a brief moment, introduces a sensibility miles away from the childishness of the main action. By the final credits, which feature the increasingly tired scattering of outtakes, one is left with the feeling that these are considerably more 'spontaneous' than the film from which they spring. If nothing else, Dumb And Dumberer sadly proves its own maxim, that \"there's nothing more American than doing nothing and getting away with it.\"",

After seeing the trailers, I did not expect this movie to be anywhere near the hilarity of the original, but this was outrightly STUPID. I laughed at one scene, *SPOILER* where Lloyd is dictating to Harry what to say to Jessica, and that was it. Not to say that this is the fault of either Eric Christian Olsen or Derek Richardson, they played their parts well, and also looked extremely similar, but nonetheless no one can recreate the characteristics of Jeff Daniels as Harry Dunne and Jim Carrey as Lloyd Christmas. I would not recommend seeing this movie to anyone. I loved the first one, and some may complain that we are too expectant to see the same quality of film. But why make a sequel when you know its going to be bad? Why did they make this film? The original was just about 2 completely idiotic best friends, and nothing more.

I mean, people laugh at Family Guy, a show with humor clearly as subjective and ridiculous as that of Dumb and Dumberer. Even Blue Collar humor is more clich\u00e9d than this. I admire the entire good mood of this film. I felt great after viewing it. I also haven't laughed that hard in an unnamed amount of time.

I did laugh at the mascot guy, and some of the interactions between the characters were original.But again, my expectations were very, very low when I watched it and I also watched it at 4 AM so I might be biased.But I know a horribly unoriginal movie when I see one and they definitely tried to add an original flair to this, which is funny at times.I would say it's about 25% as engaging as the original.",

It was one of the most poorly written, thrown together for profit piece of trash ever. The jokes were recycled, the acting left much desired for(with the exception of Richardson), and even Eugene Levy's part wasn't funny. Levy is a great actor who can be very funny and this movie didn't utilize his talent at all. They made the characters appear to be retarded instead of just dumb (what's so funny about that!?), they made Lloyd come off gay which he wasn't in the original. Lloyd's dad was ridiculous and not in the good way.To make up for jokes, talent and creativity, they inserted music montages throughout using footage you JUST saw 5-10 min earlier. This movie has nothing to do with Dumb and Dumber. It's completely terrible and not worth seeing. I'm angry that they tried to franchise the coolest movie ever into this rubbish. Thumbs down.",

There was no humor that was even remotely intelligent and anything that could have been construed as funny was stolen from the original film which I actually enjoyed very much. Eugene Levy definitely has redeeming qualities that can prop up a bad comedy into respectability, but this one is just too bad to comprehend. The acting is terrible save Levy and the kid who plays Lloyd because he at least studied how Jim Carey's Lloyd behaved in \"Dumb and Dumber\". The plot is shallow, dim-witted and lacks even a slap-stick appeal. There is no reason anyone should ever see this movie for any reason.",

That was funny, and i think it was the only good laugh for me in the whole film.

It probably would have been much easier to just make a straight sequel to the first movie. i would have much rather seen that then this movie.The movie does not really seem to be about Harry meeting Lloyd at all. Though the first few minutes are, it quickly moves away from this to involve a plot with a corrupt principle(?) It tends to get very strange at times. Harry and Lloyd just really get in the way of the plot and you begin to want them to leave any of the scenes they are in. Onto the characters of Harry and Lloyd. The actors do an alright job trying to be Jeff Daniels and Jim Carrey. Sometimes a little bit too hard to be them.The plot is nothing new, and neither is the movie. But it does tend to have it's moments of over-the-top stupidity, that you just can't help but laugh. But some of the scenes also tend to grow annoying and create the feeling of wanting them to end....Quickly. When the final credits rolled, I was left feeling a little cheated. Not too much is really told about how Lloyd grew to want to hit on girls so much. He seems to really dislike them in this movie. Go figure.I wouldn't really recommend this movie to fans of the first movie, because nothing new is really brought to the table on the characters. I will, however, recommend the first Dumb & Dumber. One of my all time favorite funny movies. I think this was the first farrely brother's movie. And it is really funny. In this movie it just feels that they might have wanted to top the farrely brother's job with the first movie, and it slowly goes flat.Just skip this one unless you want a couple of laughs.

One was the half-sized bus (I have a thing about oddly-sized objects, I don't know I just am amused by that sort of thing, big doors or over-sized glasses) and the other was the scene in which Loydd talks about Harry's mum and being his step dad.

Unfortunately, there's only one word in the English language that could possibly sum up DUMB AND DUMBERER - and it rhymes with kite.Plotwise, and that's a laughable word to use here, D&D tells the story of how dumbass friends Harry and Lloyd came to meet at high school. Forget the original's gutsy charm; this is a teen gross-out movie along the lines of \"American Pie\" - but as the two main protaganists have the mental age of a five year old (between them) - their goals aren't to lose their virginity or anything adult like that, simply to recruit people to be in their special needs class.Sound fun? I especially like the way that director Troy Miller decided to make Harry and Lloyd unlikeable dur-durs, thereby removing the only possible remaining interest for the audience. In the original, Harry and Lloyd were funny - braindead, for sure, but funny. You wanted to see them succeed in their wholly unattainable goals; here, you're waiting for something bad to happen just to get them off the screen for a few precious minutes.The only positive thing about this movie - and it's a very small positive, nowhere near enough to actually go see it - is Eugene Levy as the school's scheming headmaster. Eugene is one of the funniest actors in America at the moment and it's sad to see him in drivel like this. Were it not for his presence, I'd definitely have walked out the cinema mid-movie.Avoid this, it's the worst movie of the year. * / *****",

But in this film, with lines like \"My name's Lloyd Christmas\"...\"You're Santa's kid?\" it just seems like some people pretending to be dumb.  And putting them in a special ed class makes it something not so funny anymore.  If you watch the way they act, you can imagine that they really would need to be in a special ed class.The material from the original movie rehashed in this one is forced and not funny.  When you hear lines like \"Just when I thought I couldn't get any madder at you, you go and do something like this..\" you know what's coming. And that takes a lot of humor out of it.I forced a single laugh, during Bob Saget's scene (which grew old at light speed).  What people don't realize is that Bob Saget's career has turned into showing up in movies to say something crude, just because he was the dad in Full House.  It's outgrown any humor, and the scene itself (there's sh!t all over the bathroom!) displays every forced thing in this movie.I was relieved when the credits ran.

Starring Jim Carrey as Lloyd Christmas and Jeff Daniels as Harry Dunne the film took these two friends and threw them into a wild adventure full of gross and outrageous humor. The director's would continue this style of humor in upcoming films such as Kingpin and There's Something About Mary. Considering Dumb and Dumber was such a hit it was natural for a sequel to follow. Nine years later fans got Dumb and Dumberer but without the same cast and director's you pretty much know what to expect.The film takes place in 1985 as Harry (Derek Richardson) is about to attend high school, which will be his first time in a public school. Harry was the product of home school by his mother but she feels it's time for her son to get out into the real world and make friends. On his way to school the dumb Harry gets lost and eventually bumps into the dumber Lloyd (Eric Christian Olsen) who is also lost. The two join forces and head to school to take things over but of course the dumb duo are the laughing stock of the school.Inside the school Principle Collins (Eugene Levy) has his own plans for the new year. A rich guy is offering every school one hundred thousand dollars if they create a class for the mentally challenged. Collins along with his girlfriend plans to create a fake class so that they can steal the money and head to the beach. The only way to get their fraud going is to find a couple dumb students to recruit over dumb students for this class. Of course this challenge falls into the laps of Harry and Lloyd and they do their best to gather other dumb students. However, the beautiful school reporter Jessica Matthews (Rachel Nichols) seems to know something is wrong with this class so she begins to investigate and befriends the two dumb friends who happen to fall in love with her.I have to be honest and say I was pretty disappointed when Dumb and Dumberer showed up by FedEx because I really didn't want to see the thing after hearing so many bad reviews. Every film critic seemed to give the film no higher than one star and the film is in the bottom one hundred at the IMDb. I went into the film expecting something truly horrible and that's pretty much what I got but there are a few funny scenes and one extremely funny scene that makes me want to tell people they should check the film out. I certainly wouldn't spend over two dollars on the movie but if you get the chance to view it for free go ahead and give it a shot.I'll start with all the badness in the film. For starters, I was dying for a sequel to the original film but this certainly isn't what I wanted. I really hate when characters are brought back and none of the original stars are playing the original roles. I know this is a prequel but I'm guessing this was made over a sequel because either Carrey or Daniels weren't interested in another film. Any sequel or prequel should have been put on the shelf since neither of them were involved but what we have here is a poor excuse to milk money from the fans of the original film. Looking at the box office totals apparently fans didn't fall for this movie so good for them.The biggest problem is the film is trying way too hard to be funny. You can tell the actors are over doing everything from their lines to their facial expressions trying to make us laugh but the screenplay resorts to jokes from the first film and they simply don't work here. Another problem is the incredibly annoying lead actors who really don't add anything to the roles. I know they are playing younger versions of Carrey and Daniels but instead of acting like them, the new actors simply mock them and try to follow in their footsteps. Again, perhaps this is to be expected but all it does in the end is make us feel sad that Carrey and Daniels aren't here.The majority of the jokes are very stupid and don't get any chuckles let alone laughs. We get stupid fart jokes and stupid jokes about one friend's mother hitting on the other. As I mentioned earlier there are some funny scenes and one hilarious scene that centers around Harry and his so-called date with Jessica at her house. Harry is expecting to lose his virginity and this here leads to some very big laughs. There's some toilet humor in the bathroom, which had me laughing harder than any recent film I can recall. This scene here would make me tell you to check the film out on television. Bob Saget has a few good scenes but poor Eugene Levy is pretty much wasted throughout the film. Dumb and Dumberer is a pretty bad movie but the date scene is worth a Cinemax viewing.",

It's just some crappy movie the studios are trying to get money for. It'll suck.\" And I'm sure most people will tell me I was right. And okay, it was some crappy movie the studios were trying to cash in on BUT, it most definitely did NOT suck. In fact, it rocked! If you want to see this movie because you loved the first one, you probably will hate it. You'll probably say it lost all the appealing features of the first one and just kept the dirty \"potty humour\". And I won't argue with you. But, if like me, you can look at this film, not as a prequel to a great movie, but as just a movie, you should find it has a certain charm.Eric Christian Olsen made a complete transformation for this movie (its hard to believe, but he's the \"cocky blonde guy\" from Not Another Teen Movie\"). He did as good a job, if not better, than Jim Carrey could have done himself. It's a worthwhile movie, just to see ECO play this character so well. And then there's Bob Saget. Everyone knows him as the dad in almost every cute kids TV show, so to hear him swear like that...well that's worth the price of rental at least! Anyway, this movie isn't going to make you think, or do anything more than make you glad you have a better IQ that Harry and Lloyd, but it is one of those movies that is so funny and simple that I, at least, want to watch it over and over again. Give it a chance, keep an open mind, forget about the original. It might not be a good \"prequel\", but it is a great movie. In my humble opinion, at least. :-)",

This is of course the much awaited second installment (a prequel) to the surprise hit of 1994 that put Jim Carrey on the map more than any other film he had done before. I enjoyed that first movie very much because it had a cleverness to its insanity (that was due to the Farrelly Brothers). There was intelligence and a bit of emotion to that production. Nothing remains here though as Eric Christian Olsen (Jim Carrey originally) and Derek Richardson (Jeff Daniels originally) do indeed meet as they start their final year of high school in 1986. Richardson has been home-schooled by a loving, but somewhat dim-witted mother (Mimi Rogers) and Olsen lives within the school with his janitor father (the usually dependable Luis Guzman). They do crash into each other literally just as evil principal Eugene Levy comes up with a scheme to steal $100,000 that will be donated to the school for students with special needs. Thus he and lunch-lady/lover Cheri Oteri (of \"Saturday Night Live\" fame) bring the titled pair together and develop a class of morons and lazy pupils. Naturally the typical insanity takes place with humor that might accidentally entertain youngsters with its tasteless brand of toilet jokes. Just an ugly mess that drops the American cinema down a few more painful pegs. Turkey (0 stars out of 5).",

We were going to finally see how Harry met Lloyd, and it was pretty funny how they did. I was very anxious to see this movie, and a good thing was its opening day was the last day of school for me so a few friends of mine and I went to go see it.--First Flaw: Characters.What I saw was Eric and Derek (ha ha) doing an amazing job of recreating Harry and Lloyd, but everyone else did a $hitty job being their characters, like Mrs. Heller and Principal Collins for example. Also, I thought Brener and Miller didn't know what they were doing because they kind of overexaggerated Harry a bit, like with the hair and the dumbererness.Second Flaw: Script.Too many of the jokes in the movie were give-away jokes, meaning they were given away before they happened so they weren't as funny. And also this line: Harry \"I can't believe she's wewaring that outfit!\" Lloyd \"Yeah. Last time I wore those shorts I got beat up\" and he was saying it like it was a bad thing, when earlier in the movie, he said Turk beats him up because he is cool.Third Flaw: Editing.There are many parts in the movie when you can see the black paint on Lloyds chipped tooth. Also, there were a few scenes that could've been done better or cut from the movie like the first convenience store scene when Lloyd introduces Harry to slushies.Fourth Flaw: Troy Miller.He did well in Mr. Show and is currently doing well in Viva La Bam, but he isn't as good as the Farrellys when it comes to movies.--Overall, this was a funny movie and was well written and directed at times. It would've been better if the Farrellys did it. 7.5 out of 10.-djt",

I rate this movie 62%. Also Eugene Levy is pretty good as the bad Principle.",

I knew that it would be mediocre in comparison to the masterpiece that is Dumb & Dumber played by wonderful hilarious actors. Obviously, not everyone's going to like the fact that it's played by different people (including me.) It's enjoyable though there are some eye-roller moments. It's a fun movie that's easy to watch, especially if you're bored. If anyone expected a masterpiece, they probably came out of the theater wondering why they even bothered. But what do you expect from a sequel with different people playing the roles? It was just a bomb waiting to happen.",

The plot needed strengthening and there were some extremely tiresome bits, but this movie is not at all as bad or as worthy of hatred as some of the comments and reviews would lead one to believe. It isn't a Farrelly Brothers comedy, it isn't a Jim Carrey comedy. As a light-hearted teen stoner comedy, it's cute. But if you're expecting the unique type of humor the Farrellys and Carrey are famous for, you'll be disappointed simply because this just isn't them. If it stood alone as summer fluff, there would have been a lot of fans who genuinely enjoyed it. Leave your preconceptions behind. Go into it with an open mind and without expecting a cinematic masterpiece, and you'll get some laughs.",

This can be attributed to the terrible plot which I won't go in to right now. The only person in this movie who even got a smirk out of me was Cheri Oteri (past SNL actress). I have the first one on dvd, and I still watch it from time to time and it makes me laugh, with Jim Carrey you can't go wrong.

As we all know this movie is a prequel to the Farrelly Brothers 1994 hit Dumb and Dumber, which starred Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels as the chicken brained Lloyd and Harry. As inane as that movie may have been, it was funny in a gross way, and had some heart. Unfortunately, it also made a lot of money at the box office, which gave some genius the idea to make another movie based on the same characters. That all the main players of the original \u0096 the directors, writers and stars \u0096 have since priced themselves out of the market for a quickie cash grab like this didn't stop the producers from cobbling together a wide variety of second rate talents (and I use that word with a hint of irony attached) to present one of the least funny and ineptly made movies to ever play at your local multi-plex.",

Well, that's what you get with Dumb and Dumberer, a sequel that truly never needed to be made, but was very funny to say the least.No, it is nowhere near on par with the original, and it seemed like this one would have been a total stinkfest from the previews.  It certainly had a tough act to follow, no doubt, but amazingly it pulled it off.  There are a few acts that don't work, but there are never any real 'groaners'.  Funny movies like Van Wilder and Old School have their fair share of complete groaners in addition to funny parts, but this one is practically groaner free.  It flows almost haphazardly along, with pretty bad editing (I read somewhere that the original cut was close to 2 hours long!), but the short running time means that we are never really bored with what is going on. And yes, there are a few scenes of guilty pleasure childish delight that almost had me in tears, and many more that made me laugh out loud.  Sure the humor isn't for everyone, but I think if you lower your expectations, you will be pleasantly suprised.  I mean, how could you go into a movie like this with high expectations?The first one was a classic and is STILL FUNNY even today.  This one is a worthy successor, though slightly below par, which in this case, is still good.  The two actors truly mastered Carrey's and Daniels' mannerisms perfectly, which is half the fun (especially the actor playing the young Jim Carrey...he got his facial expressions down cold).  I don't usually rate movies like this that high, but I give this one an 8/10.  Why so high you may ask?  Well, it was a comedy, and though not ingenious, it kept me very entertained and provided many great laughs, a rarity these days.  I recommend this movie to those who can appreciate silly humor that concentrate more on humor than shock value. 8/10 stars.",

A few of my friends were not interested in seeing the film, as they stupidly believed that it is not possible to make a good second installment to a film without any of the original cast or crew. So i dragged my brother to see it. Within moments we were in tears of laughter.From the word go the film hits you with some of the silliest jokes you could imagine, and they work. From Lloyd thinking Harry's mum is the tooth fairy, to discovering that Lloyd's dad is in fact a latino school janitor (wonderfully played by the very charismatic Luis Guzman). Granted, most of the characters in the film are quite dumb, but that is what makes the film work. If, like in the 1st film, everyone except Harry and Lloyd were smart, the comedy would not work. You begin to understand why Harry and Lloyd are so incrediblly stupid. I also believe that if everything was the same as the 1st film, then people would just be saying \"it is the same movie, nothing new\".Troy Miller has definately proved that he can make a good comedy. He is on par with the Zuker brothers and Jim Abrahams. I would love to see a Troy Miller movie starring Will Farrell, Chris Kattan, and Leslie Neilson. With cameos by Adam Sandler, Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson and Rbin Williams. Obviously, by looking at my choice of comedians, you will begin to understand my sense of humour. So if you do not find these guys funny, then i recommend you give this film a miss. Stick to the more 'straight comedies' such as Legally Blonde (ZZZZZZZ!!).Derek Richardson has manged to mimic Jeff Daniels perfectly. It is very believeable to think he is a younger Daniels. Eric Christian Olsen brings something of his own to Lloyd. The voice is similar, but Olsen has obviously realised that mimicing Carrey will get him slated by critics and audiences, so Lloyd belongs to Olsen in this film.I loved this film. On DVD release, it will definately find it's way into my collection.I give it 4 out of 5.",

Oops enough nostalgia.The positive of this movie is that the make up was great.  Harry and Loyd looked exactly like Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels. I saw the actors in an interview without the makeup, and they are completely different looking. It was quite a transformation.   Unfortunately this movie was just plain boring and not very humorous.  One of the few funny scenes is when Harry pulls out a melted Hershey bar from his pants, and tries to get the chocolate off by rubbing it on the walls of the bathroom.

The scenes where they're all together had me rolling. Even the store clerk is a good laugh. Though, of course the stars of the show are Eric Christian Olsen as Lloyd Christmas and Derek Richardson as Harry Dunne. Playing a young Jeff Daniels and Jim Carrey in his prime is an insane challenge, but they pull it off flawlessly.The only flaw in this otherwise hilarious movie is the entire Principal scamming money plot. Not only is it dull, but Cheri Oteri and Eugene Levy are absolutely horrible. Not one scene of theirs is even slightly funny. Cheri Oteri is just yet another no talent SNL'er who's popular for no good reason. Thankfully they get very little screen time.If not for the lame Principal plot and acting, this would be a five. Don't let that stop you though, everyone else in the film turns in a terrific performance.

Now here is a prequel (the execs probably thought, hey Lucas can do it, how hard can it be) and I think that, if anything else, it is an extremely pale reread/imitation of the original material. I'm not saying the movie is entirely laughless, in fact there were a few moments when I had a chuckle or two or some grins at the reckless ingenuity of the characters' stupidity (there's even one laugh out loud moment inside the \"Special-Needs\" classroom involving a quiet jock when he gets riled up by the other students). The problem lies in that any of the \"original\" jokes or gags have been done in so many other movies it can only be amusing after a while to the most slight of minds...which means that it will at least earn back a little of the money it took to make it. In other words, Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd is precisely for it's target group, and it doesn't aim for anything more or audacious like the original, and there's only a minor curiosity to see these two knuckleheads portray younger versions of Carrey and Lloyd.

I thought I was in for a treat.Sadly, it was mostly painful to watch.  Lowbrow humor amuses me - don't get me wrong, I loved the first film - but this one just couldn't pull it off the way the Farrelly brothers did it.  Bob Saget shouting about poo was funny the first time, but hearing him continue to shout just got lame after 10 seconds or so.  And when a similar scene came up near the end...   well, just forget it.A few amusing scenes...  The opening scene with incident with the doctor. - How Lloyd chipped his tooth. - The note Lloyd left for his dad. .....  that's all I can think ofsigh....   at least it was a slightly cheaper matinee...Galto",

I loved the original. It was the Farrelly's bros at their best. The orig. had a clever story. The joke of this movie is, \"whoa these guys are so stupid..ha ha.\" I almost walked out of the theatre. Bob Sagat does make the movie enjoyable for the 20 seconds he's in it. The talented Olsen twins couldn't have even saved this movie. Why can't people make good comedies? Good comedy, meaning a movie that's clever that you'll laugh at. Anyways. I'm out.",

It wasn't only the subtle humor in the first film, but also the scenic locations they used.  From RI to Aspen, we were along for the trip, amused with each scene building upon the last.  But, what humor can be found from this film?  What story-line are we exposed to?  The answer is none.  I was particularly impressed with the portrayal of Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels that these two new actors gave, but this was the only impressive part of the film.  I know I cannot expect a \"high-class\" comedy with a film like this, but none of the jokes worked in this film.  None of the blatant puns or overused \"one-liners\" even remotely gave the impact of the first film.  Although, I will concede that the scene with Bob Saget and the Hersey's Bar was enough to crack a smile, but this still does not justify spending 8 bucks.  This felt more like watching a film written by and staring Rob Schneider. Dirp. 1/10",

It took me about 15 minutes to acclimatize to the new actors, Lloyd nailed it and it took me a little while to get Harry. I don't think they built the girls reason why she was doing an investigation into the principle of the high school. But every thing other then her doing the investigation was hilarious.The two guys were actually retarded in this movie and you can see that in the first movie they were smarter. I hate bob sagat humor but after half-baked and this movie I have a different opinion of him as an actor. The chocolate bar scene started out a little fishy, but was dam good once I figured it out. I loved the shopping cart chase scene and the brain freeze scenes had me cracking up.I see a dumb and dumberer first road trip sequel. And I am crossing my fingers that a dumb and dumber original sequel can be made with the original actors. And even a third version called grumpier old dumb and dumber men.The part that made me laugh the hardest was when the credits were rolling and they had the out takes. A person behind me said they should have left those parts in. I'm guessing in the editing process scenes were cut that explained more about the movie. I bet the DVD will have a completely different version and have a lot of the out takes.I was not disappointed and enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to anyone who loved the first movie.",

After about 5 minutes, no one was responding at all to my little outbursts, so I just stopped and watched the movie.

The jokes were shallow, predictable, and weren't even funny.  Not even Eugene Levy or Shia LaBeouf were laugh-worthy.  Sadly enough, only Bob Saget should get any credit for laughs here.  However, \"Harry\" and \"Lloyd\" actually captured their older counterparts quite well.Another major problem I had with this movie was the anachronisms.  No matter how stupid or amateurish the movie may be, if it's supposed to be 1986, at least put in some other than dressing everyone up like it's a bad 80s dance party.In short, don't even bother seeing this movie unless you really enjoyed the first one, or you're too young to drive yourself there and you plan to entertain yourself by farting the entire night and kicking the back of everyone's seat in front of you, because that's what the 3 incredibly immature kids behind me did, which made the movie even worse.",

            "content": "What on earth was I thinking when I willingly purchased a ticket for this abysmal attempt at a prequel? I know that prequels/sequels generally never live up to the expectations of the original, but I feel I must applaud Troy Miller on setting a new benchmark that sequels must stay well clear of.The movie starts off by showing us a little bit of Harry's (Derek Richardson) childhood and a 'hilarious' experience with his imaginary friend. And take it from me folks, it gets worse. What follows is 90 minutes of pure cinematic dung. From the distasteful (a scene in which Harry appears to smear faeces on a bathroom wall) to the downright confusing (a not so funny `your it' sequence in a convenience store).My view after watching the 1994 original was that Lloyd and Harry were just two buddies that were caught up a world that was just moving too fast for them. However, in this movie, Miller puts them across as being mentally disabled and so incompetent that they may not even develop into the people they are in the 1994.The film takes every single hilarious scene from the original and milks it relentlessly, so much so that you may find yourself cringing when a line from the first is said. Don't get me wrong, I LOVED the original, it is one of my favourite comedies but this shoddy knock-off has the ability to discourage a person from watching the original.The cast list looks attractive on paper. Eugene Levy, Luis Guzman, Mimi Rogers and Cheri Oteri have all starred in fine comedies over the past few years but this movie is one I think that would be better left off the r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Eric-Christian Olsen on the other hand may be one of the lucky ones, and this may actually benefit his career. His perfect take-off of Jim Carrey is flawless in both mannerisms and accent. He even managed to get a chuckle out of me in a scene involving him using a floor buffer on a sidewalk.\nAll in all, this movie is a complete waste of time and money for the cinema patron. If you want a laugh, rent the original. Its jokes are still as funny as they were in 1994, however, I can't see us looking back in 2012 in reminisce this movie.1 out of 10",

However, the actor that plays Harry shows his inexperience. He almost looks like the original Harry, but he's just not quite goofy enough. If you look at the movie poster, it's very obvious that he's just not suited for the role. The only actors that are worth seeing in the movie are Eugene Levy as the principal of the high school and Cheri O'Teri as the \"special needs teacher.\" Oh, and I can't forget Bob Saget screaming obscenities in two different scenes in the movie. Those two moments are priceless, something you don't expect from somebody as straight-laced as Bob Saget. Other than those three, the other characters in the movie really don't capture your attention.I honestly haven't sat down and watched all of the first one, but this one definitely disappointed me.

The whole time I was watching this movie my friend and I shook our heads in shame as the two main actors (playing Harry and Lloyd) tried to impersonate the infamous Carrey and Daniels' jokes from the first movie.  It just isn't happening.  From the \"I LIKE IT ALOT\" to the \"It\" game, the movie just flunked in the joke area and impersonations.  It was full of potty humor, that mainly kids would enjoy. I will admit.  I did laugh at a few parts in the movie.  For example, best part - Bob Saget swearing at the top of his lungs. However, just as most of us thought, this movie was a pitiful attempt to try and recount the hilarious movie of 1994.  No Farrelly Brothers, no Jim Carrey, no Jeff Daniels!  You know it's going to be a flop.  One of the best parts of the first movie was the quality songs that went along with the plot (i.e. \"The Flower Girl\", \"Boom Shack-a-lak\", \"Oh Pretty Woman\", etc.). This movie was void of a good soundtrack.  Save your $8.25 and wait until this comes out on video. P.S.  - Sorry to Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels - this movie is an embarassment to your brillance and laughter you created in the first movie. YOU SHOULDA BEEN IN THE SECOND ONE!Rating:  C-  (2 out of 5 stars)",

There were only two scenes that were funny, the rest was just infantile filler to make it 90 minutes long. You could definitely tell that the Farrelly Brothers had nothing to do with it.In short, worse than Weekend at Bernie's II (1993).",

The whole story line and everything was so corny I almost got up and left, but I payed $6.50, and I wasn't gonna waste my money. I feel like I did though. There were only a couple funny jokes but the rest of the movie was unoriginal.  I can't believe this movie made it to the theaters.  It was a complete waste of time and money and I strongly recomend not seeing it. It recieves 1 out of 10 stars, and thats being generous!",

Also, the movie used the same jokes as in the first one only they weren't as funny the second time (especially since I've seen the first one about a hundred times).  All in all, this movie was nowhere near as funny as the original and I was thoroughly disappointed.",

            "content": "After seeing this I still believe that the first one was a product of its time that everybody loves because of nostalgia because this movie is actually pretty accurately made to fit in with the first one. Even though it's clear what the general consensus is with this movie, it doesn't feel like a quick cash grab to just cash in on the popularity of the original and actually has a few throwbacks to the original, some more obvious than others. And this movie actually has the added bonus of providing a scene that I laughed harder at than anything in the first movie.\n\nNow, saying that doesn't mean I like the movie and it's a blessing and a curse at the same time. While the tone and humor is similar to that of the first to fit in with the timeline and characters, it also means that I didn't really laugh a lot either. I noticed I had a few more chuckles sprinkled throughout this time but that's because of the references to the first and the little jabs here and there at certain things, the joke about doing nothing and fitting in, in America made me smile. The scene that I laughed at though I thought would raise the score up a little but nothing else like that happened again and the joke happened a little too early in the movie. The reaction one character has to something that happens in their bathroom had me laughing a lot, his reaction was what made it funny, it's a gag joke a little different from the rest. Even the dream sequence was better in this movie, it was more creative and just as soon as I thought it was going on too long, it finished! Which is unlike the other movie. The movie also has the problem that was in the first with someone saying a joke and cutting away seconds after they say it, it didn't happen that often but it was still there. Also, the opening credits were funny again, woo, and it even has 'Joon 13' on the cover.\n\nI think the actors that played Harry and Lloyd were well chosen, they looked the part and acted like a young Harry and Lloyd would, they were written the same way and acted the same way, it's believable and well done. The plot was also like the one from the first movie, things just keep going wrong for our characters who are always in the wrong place at the wrong time and totally oblivious to what's going on. The side characters were good, especially the ones in the 'special class' even if they weren't used as much as I would have liked and Eugene Levy is always there for a good laugh, even if he wasn't as funny like he usually is but it was probably the script, you can only do so much. And some of the acting isn't the best either. It also does have some very odd cameos.\n\nWhile I've said it fits in with the previous movie, it did feel quite cheap which is probably where some of the criticism comes from but hey, at least it's short. Dumb & Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd might not be that great, it is much like the first movie and it's harmless and you even find out how Lloyd chipped his tooth. It's innocent enough and once again has likeable characters in the lead but it's clear what everyone else thinks. Some call it pointless and even though I thought that a few times, when you get right down to it, every movie is pointless. I personally don't think it's the monstrosity that the majority seem to think it is but that's just the beauty of an opinion, it's not a masterpiece but neither was the original and hey for what it's worth, this one actually made me laugh.",

Set in their carefree high school days in 1986, Harry and Lloyd become the unwitting pawns of a corrupt principle who's attempting to embezzle state funds by creating a fake \"Special Needs\" class.  Featuring Eric Christian Olsen, Rachel Nichols, Eugene Levy, and Shia LaBeouf, the casting is pretty good; Olsen in particular does a great job at emulating Jim Carrey's performance from the original.  And the comedy is well-written, staying true to the first film and offering several homages.  Still, the film tries a little too hard to be like the original and doesn't quite have the same spirit.  Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd is fun and entertaining, but it plays things kind of safe and sticks to a standard high school comedy formula.",

The two lead actors are quite convincing in their stupidity and you will find yourself laughing at a few jokes but overall it lacks the typical touch of the Farrelly brothers who have a special knack to portray uncanny characters in silly situations and write excellent jokes.",

There were a few funny parts and then the \"really?\" parts. Compared to the 1st movie, the actors who played Lloyd and Harry were a lot dumber than Carrey and Daniels. I get that they're supposed to be dumb, but at least the original showed that they were still somewhat smart on their moves. As for making a prequel, I think it was just only on how to show how they became friends, but they could've done that with a sequel with putting in a flashback. \n\nD+",

DUMB AND DUMBERER: WHEN HARRY MET LLOYD is more of an homage to DUMB AND DUMBER than anything.

As your average teenage film (not to be taken seriously) I'd give it a nod. If you compare it to the first, I'll admit that this movie deserves hate. We all expected Carrey and Daniels to return with comical results. Olsen did a great job at playing Lloyd if that's any concillation while Richardson did a decent job as Harry. The rest of the cast should have been replaced for their sleepy performances and while I admire Eugene Levy, he should stick to playing Jim's Dad. If you love crude jokes and short laughs, then dumb and dumberer should garner your vote.
