            "content": "`Awful', `Hopeless', `Terrible', `Benifer's Gate'.These are the words I read from some of North America's most respected film critics in my research before viewing the debacle Gigli starring Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez.  At first, I wondered aloud 'how bad can it be'. After all, how often does the common public agree with the harsh words of a critic.  Besides, Pacino and Walken in the same film should be enough to generate even one star out of even the sternest critic, right.  Right?\nGigli is about two unbelievable gangsters who are assigned the task of kidnapping and watching over a prosecutors mentally challenged brother while also keeping an open eye on each other to ensure the success of the operation.  Ben plays Gigli, an accent challenged goon who is as believable as Madonna in a nuns uniform, and Jennifer plays Ricky, a lesbian gangster who is primarily hired to ensure that Gigli doesn't screw things up.\nAlong the way, plenty of bit characters and ridiculous side plots stymie the progress of the mission.  Ricky has an ex-lover show up at the house and attempt suicide, the gangsters ask for the thumb of the prisoner sent to the prosecutor, Gigli has to rush to his mothers house and learns that good ole ma knows all about lesbians and throughout the film we are constantly annoyed by conversations between Gigli and his crime boss, Lenny over the phone. I could go on, but what's the point.Gigli was one of the worst reviewed films of 2003.  So I began to wonder why this film in particular ended up on everyone's poop list even though there were plenty of worse films people were throwing good money at (Boat Trip, Bad Boys II, Masked and Anonymous).    The answer became pretty obvious. Nothing was expected of these other entries, but Gigli had the star power of the two most talked about celebrities in Tinseltown.  Throw in director Martin Brest who has had incredible success with Scent of a Woman, Midnight Run and Beverley Hills Cop, and sprinkle in the veteran a-list power of Christopher Walken and Al Pacino.  With a recipe as rich as these ingredients suggest, one's expectations are set to a higher standard. Gigli simply does not deliver the goods.  The dialogue is so laughable that you expect this film to have midnight showings a la Rocky Horror Picture Show in the next ten years, and the characters are so eccentrically hysterical that you can't help but cringe in your seat in embarrassment for all those involved.So now back to the critics.  We, owe you an apology.  Most of the year, we read your reviews and chastise your opinions, but every once and a while, a consensus amongst your peers keeps us from going in mass and spending our hard earned dollars on crap like this.  A $6 million dollar domestic take for Gigli is an example of the power that you possess, and for that, I will keep reading.",

If this is considered a love story between Lopez and Affleck, may I ask...where was the love? A sex scene with no nudity, no passion, and no sound....why? Supporting characters like Christopher Walken and others were introduced and went no where...why? The story alone peeks when Pacino arrives and shoots one of the cast members. From there, i was hoping that Pacino had finished the job and killed the rest of the cast. If that happened, the movie would have been good. Instead, the movie drags and drags and drags. The audience is not going to care if the actors in the movie learn something or progress if they don't care about the characters. Lopez and Affleck's characters do not exist! Much like the ugly tattoos on Affleck's shoulder, the movie was not fun to look at. In my opinion, and I do not think I am wrong, if Lopez had a small nude scene and / or the movie was done as an independent film for under 2 or 3 million, Gigli would have been a giant success. Instead, we are left to wonder....why?",

            "content": "Larry Gigli is a hired thug for the mob in LA.  When he is put on a job to kidnap the brother of the Federal DA, he takes the mentally handicapped Brian to his flat with the intention of the DA dropping charges against his boss.  Later he is joined by another contractor, Ricki, who Louis has put with him to make sure he doesn't f**k the job up.  His amorous approaches towards her are rejected when she tells him she is a lesbian, but the two have bigger problems with the job itself.I rented this film because I had read all the harsh reviews, both professional and on this site, that just ripped into it and seemed to have more personal vendettas against the stars rather than objective points to make about the film.  With this in mind I decided that I would have to check it out myself; I have no personal feelings about Lopez and Affleck - their relationship is not something I have had rammed down my throat as I don't read the gossips mags and my paper of choice is the Times, where they get rather limited coverage.  Without this fatigue I was able to view the film as it came to me rather than seething with cruel and clever put downs even before the film started (as some critics clearly did).However, the critics were mostly right, even if they overreacted to the extreme.  The film starts reasonably well and you can see the potential, or at least you can see what they were thinking when the film was being put together.  Sadly, as the film continues, the thin strands holding it together are slowly unravelling until almost nothing is left of value. Some of it works well; how many times have the audience embraced a comic crime caper with hit men in the lead roles?  Here the film does have some of that type of humour (particularly in the jokes about Gigli's masculinity) but the music used to set the tone begins to grate after a while because there is nothing to support it, and everything else is flawed.The main plot is so very full of holes and stupid plot devices that it is difficult to be involved by it.  For a crime comedy, the plot doesn't need to be perfect - but it needs to be good enough so that it doesn't take away from the film, here it is so weak that it damages the film at it's core. The other side of the plot is the romance, and it is absurd!  I'm sure if I were a lesbian that I would be offended by the `I'll turn her' approach of the film, but I'm not so I'll leave that for others to debate.  However the romance between the two is unrealistic and uninvolving, the lesbian thing just makes it worse.The characters themselves are poor.  Neither Gigli or Ricki ever seem like killers - in fact even a hint of violence and they look terrified and out of their depth.  His personality seems to change to whatever the scene requires (one moment impatient, the next sensitive, the next angry) while Ricki is just sweetness and light.  Affleck and Lopez must take almost all the blame for this, their performances are as misjudged and lacking as the script. Affleck is actually not that bad - he is willing to send himself up, it is the jumping script that makes him appear to be all over the place.  Lopez is awful; someone who has done this crime comedy style movie before should have been much better but she acts like she is in a simpering rom-com.  What is surprising is just how little chemistry the two have considering they are a couple now; they just don't do the job at all.Bartha gives a dumb Rain Man impression to the point where I kept expecting him to say `I'm an excellent driver'.  His character is just a joke and I even wished for Lopez to come onto the screen whenever he was on - at least I could just stare at her body and ignore him!  The two main cameos are actually very good but unfortunately serve to show up the rest of the film. Walken is good but his character appears and disappears without reason, Pacino is much better simply because he does his menacing `woo-ha' thing and is very effective.Overall this is not the `worst film ever made', those who tell you that have clearly have a limited viewing experience; many of the reviews were made harsher by the back lash against the whole Bennifer thing.  However that's not to say they are wrong - only overly harsh.  The film is poorly judged in almost every aspect and is too hard to enjoy as a result.  Has about 3 good moments in it, but it is an overwhelming shambles.",

            "review_title": "J-Lo and Ben: 2 of the most laughable characters ever",
            "content": "J-Lo and Ben were badly miscast as gangsters in this. Neither is believable.We are supposed to believe Ricki (J-LO) is a gangster and mean just because she says so. She does absolutely nothing to make her seem dangerous. But, then it gets even funnier when she shows up in a crop top shirt, letting it all show, only to announce she's gay. What! J-Lo is just too famous for anyone to see her as gay, not to mention, she never acts like it in the film.As for Ben, he's really bad too. He's uses this horrible accent and swears a lot. I guess that means we are supposed to believe he's a tough gangster from New York because of this. He doesn't have the stomach to cut off a finger and he lets a guy that owes money only pay half. No muscle man would act like such a wuss.Then we get the mentally challenged guy that plays some role with the plot, but I'm not sure what because the plot never made sense to me. I never got the whole point of kidnapping the guy. Then there are the very bad dialogue scenes that have been mentioned many times. What was the writer thinking and how could Bennifer say those lines without laughing. And I still don't get why a lesbian would give that yoga speech to a guy in such a seductive way. So unbelievable.The only thing that made me laugh was Gigli reading to the retarded guy. He read what's on tabasco sauce bottle and charmin toilet paper.FINAL VERDICT: Gobble, gobble says it all. Overall bad acting and writing. But I have seen worse movies. I only recommend it for those who feel compelled to see J-Lo looking really hot for a couple of hours.",

            "content": "Smug and a self-adorned cine-sophisticate, I rented out Gigli with a friend ready to scrutinise it with the benefit of my enlightened view of film. It was going to be an hilarious two hours. I'd settled down in a very comfy armchair and had poured a glass of some Austrian glug. I couldn't wait to laugh at the stupid dialogue and that ridiculous script but the joke was on us because Gigli transcends the established limit of effective urine stealing. This is because its simply so horrible that you can forget trying to make yourself look intelligent and media literate by ripping the bladder evacuate because the scale of misguided conception baffles the mind and eventually shuts it down. It's like being hit by a sack full of bricks in the face for a full 114 minutes. There's a teasing little scene with J-Lo early on when she tells a bunch of unruly kids that there's a martial arts move that can gouge out the eyes and simultaneously destroy the visual cortex meaning that not only are you rendered blind but you'll never be able to remember anything you've seen. For the Gigli viewer this is like showing Charlie and the Chocolate Factory to a hall packed with diabetics. You're left to ponder the short term agony weighed up against the long term benefit as Martin Brest's story unfolds with the principle characters of a unlikeable, emotionally and sexually retarded thug with a soft centre (a fat Affleck), a lesbian who isn't really a lesbian because you can be converted to heterosexuality by an emotionally and sexually retarded thug and an actually retarded man who was probably supposed to be a Rainman-type character who redeems Affleck's arrogant meathead but is in fact a cringe inducing, self-harm facilitating caricature of the mentally handicapped. Look, many movies look good on paper and suffer from poor execution but what's head scratching about Gigli is that it's as dire on the page as it is on screen. Broadly it's supposed to be a romantic comedy, sort of Out of Sight meets Rainman meets Whats New Pussycat? but it's stillborn as a criminal caper, devoid of anything approaching sensitivity and has some of the worst battle of the sexes banter that ever crawled onto the screen. Brest, who directed the dire 16 hour remake of Meet John Doe, Meet Joe Black, shows that when it comes to misjudging material he's peerless. His crimes here are compounded by the fact that this is his own script. That script, incidentally is a roll call of on screen horror. Witness, if you can, the Penis Vs. Vagina scene in which Affleck argues the case for the male genitals or the tear jerking moment in which the soft hearted Affleck, having given the Mentally Handicapped Brian relationship advice, looks on like a proud father as his new friends woos an Australian bombshell during the filming of a Baywatch beach party. You'll envy the man who gets his brains blown out and eaten by goldfish or the horrendous girlfriend of J-Lo, who having realised which film she's in, slits her wrists...stupidly, the wrong way. Once its all over and you sit there open mouthed you're left to (briefly) ponder why Brest did it. Did the kidnapped brother have to be disabled? Surely there must have been a more effective way of facilitating Affleck's transition from idiot to slightly more compassionate idiot? Did J-Lo have to be a Lesbian? Sure, Affleck has to have some obstacles toward getting the girl and we all like a bit of sexual tension but gay viewers must have been flabbergasted that a man who describes men and women as \"the bull and the cow\" and does lovable things like warmly looking vacuous and endearingly been obnoxious should persuade a woman to er, \"hop over the fence\". And even if Brest was blinded by his own vanity what in the name of Beverly Hills Cop persuaded Christopher Walken and Al Pacino to cameo? None of it makes any sense. The bottle of wine I had with the film was good though but by the time I regained consciousness the bit left in the bottle was undrinkable.",

When the film first came out, it rocketed to number 1 on the bottom 100 list. That ranking was undeserved, as the movie does have decent technical aspects (editing, sound) relative to Manos and Future War. Its good to see Gigli settling a little further down the list. From the outset, I could tell the dialog was just horrible. It was unfunny 90% of the time, and contained useless overlong scenes. One example was the whole 'pleasing a woman' sequence where Lopez was doing Yoga on a mat while talking with Affleck. Just horrible. Jennifer Lopez has to win the award for most painfully miscast actress. She is totally unbelievable as a Lesbian girl gangster. She failed to convince me that she had ever broken the law in the past.

After all, if a couple was in the midst of a passionate affair, it is reasonable to expect some on-screen chemistry between then, right? That kind of chemistry is sadly lacking in the J-Lo/ Affleck interactions.Ms. Lopez appears to be either in over her head as far as acting ability, or realized that she was in a \"take the money and run\" failure; I did not buy her as the character she was supposed to be. Affleck was just leaden, although he had nothing to work with in terms of character or dialogue. He has not always been bad (I liked \"Chasing Amy\"), but here, his scenes crawl along at a painfully slow pace. The \"retarded kid\" (and that is all he deserves to be called) is playing a high-school play version of \"Rain Man\" with all the annoyance but none of the nuance, complexity, or charm. The less seen, the better. Forgettable cameos top the mess.The worst thing about Gigli is the endings. Imagine a painfully bad film, where you want to sit it through to the end, just because of all the pain and suffering it has put you through (\"this film is NOT going to defeat me\"). You get to the end. Then, there is another ending. Then, another ending; then, an ending involving the retarded kid. Then, an ending not involving the retarded kid. Then another... You get to a point where you sincerely believe that the editor should be forbidden from ever working in film again.

What I did see was an authentic and extensive sprinkling of coarse language and the evolving relationship between a coarse man and a human with mental disabilities as well with a sophisticated refined woman who had a lot to teach both Gigli and the audience about language, about peaceful resolution to conflict, about courage, and strong femininity. This movie really stood out for its carefully crafted treatment of mental disability in the same vein as Rain Man (1988) and its handling of violence. This movie instead of the typical rough housing, masculine action movie, this movie turns the stereotypical crime thriller into a relational drama that offers up valuable lessons for living.

            "content": "I've postponed seeing this film for quite a while for obvious reasons: it's arguably the most hated film ever made, perhaps even more than \"Battlefield Earth.\" But last night morbid curiosity finally got the best of me and I caught it on Encore.And amazingly, astonishingly, against all odds, it's not that bad. It isn't great, it isn't even quite good, but on a scale of 1 to 10, I'd give it a 6. It's okay. It held my interest from start to finish and even had some intriguing elements that far less notorious failures have lacked.What surprised me most was how heartfelt and engaging it was, thanks mainly to one of Ben Affleck's best performances. Turns out he's got a real flair for comedy; his half-baked Robert DeNiro impersonation is a hoot, and I have no doubt is quite intentional. The movie is built around his baffled/flummoxed/bemused/exasperated reactions to his ill-tempered boss, gorgeous lesbian watchdog, and handicapped hostage, and they're all quite believable and funny. Naturally, given the amount of vitriol that was directed at the film, I assumed that Affleck just phoned in his performance (as he's been known to do) but that's far, far from the case. He carries this film the way Tom Cruise carried \"Rain Man.\" Of course, \"Gigli\" is not \"Rain Man,\" but it's not Affleck's fault.\"Gigli\" is, remarkably, a genuinely and quite intentionally funny film at times, more so than the obvious and desperate \"Bringing Down the House,\" for instance. Affleck half-heartedly reading the toilet paper packaging in lieu of a bedtime story to pacify his child-like hostage is hysterical. So is the latter's \"Baywatch\" obsession and his antics with Affleck's cell phone and his \"who's on first?\" routine with Affleck's boiling crime boss.Justin Bartha, as the mentally handicapped hostage, is no Dustin Hoffman, to be sure, and at times his performance makes you cringe because his level of retardation seems to fluctuate depending on the scene -- but he gets laughs. Jennifer Lopez really struggles with some of her line readings (particularly in her scene with Al Pacino; how is this the same actress who was so impressive playing a similar character in \"Out of Sight\"?) but she looks amazing and she gives off the necessary sexual spark to make the romantic comedy elements work.But if only director Martin Brest had revised his script before shooting, to iron out the film's three principle flaws. One, it's so weak the way Lopez' character is introduced; I guess that's something many viewers just couldn't get past. She's clearly no tougher than Affleck is, so why is she there again? It might have been interesting if Affleck's boss had had a secret soft side, recognized his underling's loneliness and sent Lopez to try to kill two birds with one stone: \"cure\" Lopez of her homosexuality and play cupid. But he has no soft side; he's a two-dimensional monster, and it never makes a great deal of sense.Second, the plot is much too thin. Christopher Walken shows up for one scene and then vanishes, never to be heard from again! This film obviously NEEDS him to stick around and keep the heat on our heroes, in addition to Affleck's boss. How a filmmaker as experienced as Martin Brest could have failed to recognize that is beyond me. I can only speculate that the studio wanted to max out the Bennifer angle and stuff in as many scenes featuring the two of them as possible, even at the expense of our greatest living character actor, not to mention the demands of the story.Third, the film is 30 minutes too long and badly edited. There are a number of scenes that just stretch on two, three or four beats longer than they should, particularly that scene where Lopez scares off those punks with her interminable eye-gouging monologue. I'd heard that the dialogue in \"Gigli\" was just atrocious, but I didn't really think it was that bad, just long-winded. Had the film been edited down to a compact 90 minutes, I have little doubt that it would have received a more favorable response. There's just enough material here for a good movie, but Brest spreads it too thin.The most interesting thing about \"Gigli\" is that it's kind of a tender-hearted crime flick. It's more interested in the feelings and the emotions of its characters than the violence they engage in, or refuse to engage in. The sudden killing towards the end of the film is as jarring as anything I've seen because it comes out of nowhere, and Affleck and Lopez seem authentically horrified at what they've witnessed; in most crime films, the leads would feign disinterest and play it cool - not here.I really bought that Bartha brought out the big brother, father figure in Affleck and Lopez his sensitive, caring, feminine side. Clearly he's not cut out for his line of work, and that's what his two companions help him to realize. That is not an insignificant thing. Would that less reviled films boasted such a satisfying character arc.So why does this film have a microscopic 2.2 rating at IMDb? Perhaps people are reviewing Affleck's and Lopez' over-publicized, failed romance instead of the film - beats the heck out of me.",

            "content": "I would love to view writer/director Martin Brest's original version of Gigli, which was said to be a black comedy with very offbeat humor and no romantic subplot at all. I would also love to have seen how that film would've fared amongst critics rather than the one that was released to the public. During its release, I find the film's extremely poor reception and disastrous box office performance unsurprising. The gossip about the relationship between Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez was overexposed, obsessive drivel and tabloids raced to the neverending finish line of publishing nonsensical articles about the couple and bedazzled them beyond recognition. This was one of the key things that led to Ben Affleck's negative public persona and made it irreparable until he adopted a directorial career in 2007.Viewing Gigli a decade later, when news of Affleck and Lopez's relationship has long past faded into obscurity, the film is nowhere near as bad as people have said. In fact, it's a farcry from the worst film I've seen this year. I'd go as far as to call it somewhat enjoyable in the regard that it's always amusing in the way the characters interact with one another and the way the actors handle the absurd material they've been handed. However, in the long run, I prefer to view Gigli as a product and discuss its impact on its actors along with how its time of release greatly affected its reception.But this will be explored later on. The film revolves around Larry Gigli (pronounced Jee-lee), played by Ben Affleck, a second-rate mobster who is hired by his crime boss (Lenny Venito) to kidnap the mentally-challenged brother of a federal prosecutor to prevent the imprisonment of a New York mob boss. In addition, a woman by the name of \"Ricki\" (Jennifer Lopez), a dominant lesbian, is hired by Gigli's crime boss to keep an eye on him to make sure he doesn't screw this job up. It is a screenplay obligation that Gigli and Ricki eventually become attracted to one another, despite their differing sexual orientations.It's no surprise why the film was panned, seeing as casting both Affleck and Lopez in a romantic comedy as their heavily-documented marriage was approaching seemed to be nothing more than a tabloid-sponsored film catering to the same people that inhabit the checkout lines of grocery stores with several of the magazines on the conveyor belt. However, Affleck isn't the one giving the bad performance. His pseudo-tough guy appearance is intentional, something I hope people understood when the film was released and understand now. If anybody's performance should be criticized, it's Jennifer Lopez, who gives a wooden, wholly unbelievable performance as an attractive lesbian, who still finds it amusing and fun to flirt with a heterosexual male just to revert to the \"I'm a lesbian\" line. Her role is as contrived as they come, even with ten years of age.The most challenging role of the film easily belongs to Justin Bartha (who later made himself a name in The Hangover franchise), playing the mentally-handicapped brother. His performance ranges from senseless exploitation to somewhat heartfelt and believable. It all depends on what writer Brest feels like detailing at the specific time. Once in a great while, we'll see his charming innocence come through. At other times, we'll see him sing a rendition of Sir Mix a Lot's \"Baby Got Back\" and do a little wincing.The other thing to note is the film's use of music, which seems largely out of place. Consider the scene where Gigli, Ricki, and the prosecutor's brother are eating lunch and bouncy pop music plays, somewhat indicating a sex scene or a scene of seduction. The music is entirely out of place and provides an odd shift in tone. Scenes like this are rather frequent in Gigli and the jarring tonal shift is hard not to notice when it's something as quietly but noticeably abrupt as misplaced-music.On to the legacy Gigli has left. Many people involved with the making of the film felt some kind of rough, turbulent backlash on their careers once the picture was released. It took poor Affleck, as stated, years to rebound into a marketable, respectable name, and if it wasn't for stupendous directorial efforts such as Gone Baby Gone, The Town, and Argo, his name would likely still inspire sneers and eye-rolls. Jennifer Lopez never really got back on her acting feet after this film, and became somewhat of a faded pop singer who had little to offer. But the one person that seemed to be affected the most is director Martin Brest, who made films like Meet Joe Black and Midnight Run long before this picture. Gigli is the last film he ever made and has disbanded into something of a recluse since. He has given no interviews since its release, has not participated in any film projects, and has left his whereabouts to be nothing more than a thought in a person's mind. After the studio debacle with the film's plot and creative differences, he has vanished into unknown obscurity, with no plans to direct or participate in any film again. It would definitely seem that people were too quick to label Gigli as one of the worst films ever made. It's definitely a rocky picture, very uneven, structured very peculiarly thanks to rewrites, and features performances that range from mediocre to above average. However, it's an entertaining piece of work, if one can accept the challenge of ignoring its horribly low ratings and criticisms it has garnered over the years. This is the kind of film I'll be judged for tolerating and, if that's the case, so be it. I got a handful of films at the top of my head that may make even the most hardened-Gigli hater reconsider their opinion.",

Filler just put there to pad out the time? That's basically like Gigli, a movie that's not particularly good as a whole, but has some knockout individual scenes.First off, let's be honest...it's not as bad as we've been led to believe. Look at the message board - more and more people are admitting \"it's not that bad\". Not exactly praise, but considering SO many people voted this into the Bottom 100 (it's at #29 when I wrote this), I think it's safe to say most of those were just padded votes, mainly from people who wanted to hate this movie and hated the whole \"Bennifer\" thing. Ebert gave it mild thumbs down and said he was deluged with hate mail complaining how he didn't hate it ENOUGH. Gimme a break.OK, the plot is awful. No bones about that. In case you don't know, here it is: A mafia hit-man kidnap's a DA's retarded brother so the case won't go to trial. He's a notorious screwup, so the mob sends a 2nd hit-man, who's a lesbian and looks like a supermodel, to make sure Hit-man #1 doesn't screw up. They sit around an apartment, talking and debating. Random people show up and they have to hide the retarded kid. Every once in a while they go out for Mexican (in a convertible with the top down!!) What in the world?? And this was supposed to be a big summer movie? I suspect writer/director Martin Brest came up for the storyline in a dream and for some reason thought it was a good idea. It's not. Watching this movie is akin to having an annoying roommate who keeps changing the channel between Rain Man, Prizzi's Honor, Chasing Amy, a failed sitcom about hit men, and any play with one set and no budget.Why do I kinda like this movie then? Same reason I dig Brest's Beverly Hills Cop - there's scenes in here that are to die for. I remember as a kid, i'd rewind scenes in Beverly Hills Cop over and over again, because I thought they were the funniest things ever. Same here. There's at least 3 or 4 awesome scenes, and about 5 good ones as well. The rest is filler.Witness: The \"rip that tears the past\". The speech in front of the mirror. The yoga scene. \"Turkey time. Gobble Gobble.\" \"The Baywatch.\" The Tabasco sauce. The morgue. The plastic knife. The \"sweet hetero-lingus\". Christopher Walken, showing more fire in 3 minutes than he has in YEARS, talking about ice cream and Marie Callendar's pies. Pacino's scene. Yes, he's YELLING again. He's playing a mobster again. So what? Now name another recent movie with that many rewind-worthy scenes. I can't either.Jennifer Lopez is sexy in this movie. Anyone who says she's not is lying. Ben Affleck is not. Nor is he supposed to be. People who say he's trying to be \"sexy and dangerous\" missed the point somewhere. He's doing a riff on Andrew Dice Clay, plain and simple. He knows he's acting like a buffoon. Anyone who likes him on SNL should like him here.Everyone should see this movie at least once. You'll have a good time. Even if you're watching it to see how bad it is, you won't be disappointed. No, I wouldn't want to sit through the whole movie again. It's too long and i honestly can't remember what the hell happened at the end. But movies like this are why DVD was invented.",

Neither do anything to compliment some decent surroundings, while the music is just bizarre and badly placed. The direction starts off inept and never recovers, while the script is just cringe-worthy with some lines verging on the really cheesy side, none of the characters are likable or well written and the story is full of plot holes and unnecessary scenes.The acting in general is terrible. Ben Affleck is rather stiff and uncomfortable, but he is nothing compared to the terror that is Jennifer Lopez. And it doesn't help that there is absolutely no chemistry whatsoever between them. And how great actors such as Christopher Walken and Al Pacino signed up for this film I shall never know. Actually, they weren't too bad, Walken's character was just poorly explored but he did what he could. Pacino fared much better, and he is the sole saving grace of an otherwise dismal picture.All in all, it is really, really bad but not the worst movie I have seen. 1/10 Bethany Cox",

Gigli was released in 2003 during the peak of Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez's romance career, and many have dismissed the film's failures on them. The film had a massive budget of 54 million yet only made 7 million worldwide. One would consider this as a major reason for the film being as criticized.Gigli has a different sense of what is wants to be. Considered as a romantic crime comedy. The film does bring out several levels of romance in a predictable relationship with the leads. The plot is thin and the film does have several scenes which stretch out, yet could have been edited about 20 minutes shorter. Although even with its flaws, Gigli remains an entertaining watch, due to the fact that there are many unintentional funny and clever scenes. For such a crime gangster film, the ending does have a heart and tender feel about it. Many have dismissed the film as too violent, though there is only one really violent scene, as an unexpected jump scene. Lenghty cameo scenes are made by Christopher Walken and Al Pacino, in which some considered a saving point of the film.",

The Rain Main guy was just a rip-off. And Affleck's gangster was not believable at all (how did a guy as sensitive as he is ever get this tough guy rep? The movie never says). JLo was surprising good. And the script about a hot lesbian gangster and a dumb male gangster wasn't bad. Well, the ending was bad. I mean, after calling the cops and telling them where the \"lost\" brother is, JLo and Ben hang around at the scene for a long, long time.Pacino is excellent. Wish he was in it more. Walken was very good, but a weird character who never shows up again. It seemed like the major problem with Gigli wasn't the acting or the script, but the way it was edited.

Aside from the glaring contrast between these movies from the same time frame, we aren't here to talk about them.Gigli does feature Affleck at his worst (and I know he can and has done a lot better); however, Jennifer Lopez was surprisingly good in this movie. She exhibited a great deal more range and showed that maybe she's just getting a bad rap from naysayers like the ilk over at Aint It Cool.

ANyways, what's up with all the negative reviews and the other horrible things that have happened because of the reaction this movie received? From beginning to end, I though GIGLI was very enjoyable, well acted, well written with great diologue, and had a good pace.Ben Affleck was having a good time with his role. Some people may say he doesn't have that tough guy persona, but he showed it really well here. Weather he was being a wisecracker or getting angry, he put in a great performance. Jennifer Lopez was excellent as Ricki. This is her best role. (That might not sound right to many people out there, but I mean it, and it's saying a lot.) Her delivery of her lines was great. And of course she and Ben had very very good chemestry. It is hard to beleive that they weren't in love at the time of this film. It was kind of like watching Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz in VANILLA SKY where you could see both actors falling for each other. Such a thing was a joy to watch.The movie had the feeling of GET SHORTY or OUT OF SIGHT with it's quirkyness. Even something of a HUDSON HAWK feel. (Another horribly blasted movie which was really a great film. Maybe these two have something in common.) Christopher Walken and Al Pacino come in to deliver their own monologues. I always love watching Chris act. He is so funny. Al was his usual self, and I never get tired of his acting.I don't know what it is that people hate about this movie. Maybe it's because too many people are offended by how much Ben and Jenn are given so much attention because of their real life relationship. I really don't know what that has to do with hating a movie. Maybe it's because people expected something big?Like what?It's really sad that few people will be able to see into this film as being entertaining. Martin Brest hasn't directed a movie in 5 years. (MEET JOE BLACK, A very underrated film) I get the feeling that he won't be able to direct another movie for a long time. He is a very good director. The  producer, Joe Roth is saying the movie's failure is his fault too, so that's a sign that Martin will be blacklisted because of this. What kind of injustice is that? Ben and Jenn will probably have to apologize about this movie too. It's a good thing they already have other movies coming out, or else their careers could be seriously hurt.ATTENTION ALL OPEN MINDED PEOPLE: This isn't the best movie of the year,but there really is a good movie in here.8 out of 10",

He is assigned to kidnap Brian (Justin Bartha), the retarded brother of a federal prosecutor, for Louis blackmailing the prosecutor. Due to the importance of the 'mission', the lesbian Ricki (Jennifer Lopez) is sent by Louis to help Larry. The first point to highlight in this movie is a question: Why Al Pacino, Christopher Walker, Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck accept such a cheesy and corny screenplay? The characters of Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez are so ridiculous that spoil any story. Ben Affleck begins the movie as a tough guy, followed by a spoiled son, a romantic guy and ending like a good man. The delicious Jennifer Lopez begins lesbian (amazing, a director who gives the role of lesbian to one of the most sexy, delicious and beautiful women of the planet) and ends the story in love with Larry. Anyway, the beauty and the body of Jennifer Lopez make worthwhile a glance in this movie. My vote is four.Title (Brazil): 'Contrato de Risco' ('Contract of Risk')",

Bennifer do have some on-screen chemistry, and there are a few cute moments. The infamous \"gobble gobble\" scene is fun if you disregard the probability of a lesbian acting in such a way (see also CHASING AMY), and I also enjoyed penis/vagina debate. And Rain Boy's moment on the beach was sweet, unlikely as it may be.But the movie just drones on and on, the music is incongruous with what it's supporting on screen, the plot is uninvolving, and and the outta-nowhere cameos by Al Pacino, Lainie Kazan, and Christopher Walken stop the movie cold. But Ben takes his shirt off, revealing a buff bod and some nice tats. See? The movie's not entirely without merit.Now and then the media pounce on a movie that begs to be trashed but isn't nearly as bad as they say.  (The SWEPT AWAY remake was a previous whipping boy, and while indeed a bad movie, it was better than other Madonna movies like THE NEXT BEST THING and BODY OF EVIDENCE.)

There's a screen in blackout and a guy is talking some things; it looks like they're prepared to have fun. I'm sure they had a lot of fun, but I'm not sure if you will when you watch.I didn't have a lot of fun but the movie generates some laughs. You'll be killing me when you hear this, but it's some kind of unique experience. It was hated by everyone and it will be forever considered as one of the worst movies ever done; even when it's not that bad (as \"The Lord of the Rings\" will be considered one of the best movies ever even when it's not that good). Come on, you know there are other factors that made people reject this film. There's always a say about \"couples in real life don't have chemistry in movies\". This film's set made Affleck and Lopez fall in love. So, when the whole \"Bennifer\" thing started and this movie came up\u0085It didn't have a chance.Hollywood is overly severe with some movies. Actually, the truth is that, even when the film hasn't got the most adequate sense of humor; and it doesn't dominate it correctly (because the script repeats the same jokes, and goes crazy with the bad words as \"fuck\" and \"shit\"), the film has the best intentions. There must have been a reason (if it wasn't checking out Jennifer's ass) for Walken and Pacino to choose these roles. Their performances become stereotypes and each of them appears only once in the whole film. Probably there was a deep interest in big names for the film, and there was a deep amount of cash. Walken and Pacino are not the same as they used to be (I've talked about that before).Ben Affleck is the main star as Larry Gigli, a kind of gangster that works doing jobs that include killing people, taking money and other stuff. Affleck gives the role an incredible personality. He ends up owning the role; with his hair, his tone of voice (sometimes a little Italian)\u0085 I like to remember Affleck as Kevin Smith's boy or as the guy that co-wrote with Matt Damon the script of the amazing \"Good Will Hunting\". Does Gigli ever finish a job? We never see him doing it; but he claims to be the \"gangster of the gangsters\", when he gives and absurd speech as he tries to impress Ricki. She's played by Jennifer Lopez and that's not the character's real name. Lopez, as always puts her charming comedy skills over her looks. This wasn't exactly the most convenient choice, but I say it all the time, and I'll say it now: Jennifer Lopez is a fine (just because excellent or great are longer) actress. I've only missed two of her movies, and I love how she does it. Drop the acting career girl! The starter Justin Bartha (Brian) easily steals the film. I don't know if the retards are the ones that stand out in films where hardly the rest does (I'm talking about Leonardo Di Caprio's character in \"What's eating Gilbert Grape\"), but he gives a measured performance, without exceeding in something we've seen tons of times before. Just to say: Lenny Venito shouldn't be acting.And please, let's not bring down the man that brought Al Pacino to his best in \"Scent of a Woman\", took Eddie Murphy to success in \"Beverly Hills Cop\" and was behind Brad Pitt's very good (one of his best) performance in \"Meet Joe Black\". Yes, I'm talking about Martin Brest, who did this movie with the best intentions. His work is lame here, shooting the arm of one character and the face of another when two characters are talking; and making the actors walk to a determined part when they're going to talk so the camera can center them\u0085 The film's script is owner of an original storyline and different situations we haven't seen in a while. In the end, with the music and the stupid dramatic intensity, we realize: the film is obvious, manipulative; but somehow, you're waiting for Brian to take the jump.",

You might jeer that you sit through an annual solo(!!) screening of The Room, seated on a throne of plastic spoons. You probably think you're invincible. And here you are, stumbling through the movie graveyard, preparing to test your mettle against The Big One. The Grandfather of Garbage, the Sultan of Cine-Sh*t. The man. The legend. Gigli. Abandon all hope, ye who enter here. 'Ha', you sneer, defiantly hitting play on Netflix. Somewhere in the distance, you hear a faint skittering, as all nearby mice, birds, and insects flee in terror. 'This isn't so bad! I've already made it through the whole first scene of Ben Affleck's fourth-wall- breaking, excruciating Joiysey posturing and Big Hair with my wits intact. Gigli- schmeely!\" Oh ho. Just you wait, friend. This is the mere foreplay before the true agony begins. Now we venture into the land of Inquisitives. \"What are they saying? I can't decipher the bogus-Jersey!\" \"What is happening? Who is that man, hunched over those sunflower seeds? Is that Justin Bartha, that lovable scamp from National Treasure and The Hangover? What's he doing? Is he......is that...supposed to be like Rain Man? Why is he rapping? Oh. Oh no. Oh no no.\"Yes. But if this jaw-droppingly offensive depiction of an intellectual disability face-to-Big Hair with Affleck's mawkish gangster isn't already enough to make your eyes start to bleed, don't worry: you've yet to meet Jenny From The Block. She arrives, crop-topped, with a chorus of funk guitar fanfare, here to engage in glorious battle with Affleck and his Hair. A battle of the sexes, you say? Nay - they battle to see who can be the most embarrassing actor. And the battle is fierce. You think you've stomached flat, tone deaf, emotionally gyroscopic overacting before? Not like this. NOT. LIKE. THIS! As they open their mouths, words tumble out. Words arranged so impenetrably ornately, so indefatigably nonsensical, so riotously wretched, that they extend beyond the screen like creeping Poltergeist claws, and vigorously disembowel any viewer despicable enough to be within reach. Over time, the words feed off the despair of their listeners, accruing more malevolent mass, and becoming monologues. Monologues, anointing Affleck his true title of the 'Sultan of Slick,' christening Lopez Queen 'Dykeosaurus-Rexy,' and, in a feat of Tarantino-theft that would defy belief if everything else in this movie hadn't already defied belief out of the dictionary, explaining the process of 'Digital Orb Extrusion' in Tai Moi Chai. At this point, logical thought is a distant whiff of a memory, scattered like grains of sand in the ocean of Affleck's Hair Product. You'd want to let out a silent scream. But Affleck and Lopez have stolen all the words. And all you can do is babble. But lo! A bright star emerges! Here, we are visited by a kindly extraterrestrial from the Planet Walken. Concealing his fear behind his bug-eyed Cheshire cat grin, he attempts to approximate conventional human parlance to warn you of the dangers that ensue from prolonged exposure. But your brain has already eroded too much to decipher the coded messages hidden in his talk of ice cream and pie. Desperate, he croaks out a final warning of Gigli's most devastating side effect: \"Your tongue will slap your BRAINS out trying to get TO it!\" But it is too late. The final Brain Slap has begun. You fester in your own sick in this purgatory of Gigli's apartment, slobbering and gibbering like a lobotomized bulldog, as the strains of inappropriately saccharine romantic synth music form a dubstep remix with the word \"Baywatch,\" and jackhammer a gong in your cavernous skull. Here, the movie sinks in for the kill. You hear Bartha utter the phrase \"penis sneeze,\" but you are numb. You see every other woman in the film reduced to a boorishly flirtatious or hysterical, whimsically suicidal lesbian caricature, but you are numb. Hell, you even sit through the final hallucinogenic indignity of Al Pacino(?!), clad in a Talking Heads oversized suit, actually trying (??!?!) to infuse some class or energy into the film. But you are numb. Numb, because you have sat through two of the most stupefying monologues in cinema history. Behold: Ben Affleck's fist-pumping ode to the penis, and Jennifer Lopez's yogic aria to the vagina. With their powers combined, the film finally filibusters any remaining brain cells out of your head. 'He turns her straight, 1964 James Bond style?!' you would normally incredulously gripe. Normally. But by the time you reach the sanctuary of Baywatch, it's too late. Your motor functions have run their course; you are more vegetable than human now. The Brain Slap is complete. If only you'd listened to Walken, emissary from a faraway galaxy. He would have warned you about Gigli - namely, that the effects of consumption approximate, in the words of the beloved Douglas Adams, \"having your brains smashed in by a slice of lemon wrapped round a large gold brick.\" But there is no gold here. Only pain. Only suffering. Now - if you had a chance of preventing this fate, dear viewer. If you could turn back time, and avoid drinking in this unfathomable chasm of universal offensiveness, this abominable void of oblivion. If you could save not only yourself, but the world as you know it. If you could take the hype not as a comedic, drunken challenge, but as a dire, chilling warning. Would you be, in the words of Walken, \"InTERested?\" -1/10",

            "content": "Frank Zappa said it all about Gigli on the 1976 album Zoot Allures, during track number three: the torture never stops. Bad films come in many configurations. There are films so bad that they are funny in a reversed sort of way. There are films so bad one cannot watch the end of them because they are too boring. Then there are films that are so bad they become a sort of perverse endurance test, the kind of film that dares you to turn it off before the end credits roll. Unfortunately, Gigli is definitely the third kind. Aside from having the worst principal cast this side of an Ed Wood production, the story is so utterly incompetent it defies all rational explanation (more on that anon). When released upon a gobsmacked public, Gigli attracted such terrible reviews that theatres in England never gave it a second week. David Letterman began to use it as a regular punchline about films so excruciatingly bad one would have to be mad to watch them. And therein lies one of the big problems. Gigli is merely mediocre.The worst parts first. Whomever had the idea of casting Ben Affleck to play a mob enforcer must have been drunk, stoned, or both. He is about as intimidating as Robert De Niro's infant grandrelatives, and probably about as muscular in the forearm. He is watchable when he is not trying to pretend to be the archetypal tough-guy, but when the script requires him to be intimidating, the whole thing comes apart. The second big mistake was casting Jennifer Lopez as a higher mob enforcer called in to supervise Affleck and clean up his mistakes. To say that this stretches credulity to the outer limits is like saying that casting Jennifer Lopez in a film is a bad idea. But by far the worst problem for Gigli is a script that could have been written by trained monkeys who drank paint for weeks on end for all we know. The script's attempts at humour often revolve around the correct pronunciation of Gigli's name, a joke that gets tired about one reel in. It would have been a wiser move to build jokes around the fact that it really is pronounced \"giggly\".But by far the worst mistake of the script lies in the central premise. It all starts with Gigli getting a call asking him to kidnap the retarded brother of a judge who is hearing a case involving one of the big bosses. The people ordering Gigli to perform this kidnapping hope that they can intimidate the judge into ruling favourably for their boss. The boss in question, played in cameo by Al Pacino, apparently did not authorise this course of action, and no wonder. Kidnapping is an incredibly serious offense under federal law, and ordering it could get anyone put away for life. Granted, mob bosses like to keep all sorts of fail-safes in place so that a case can never be made that they did in fact order such a course of action, but this is beside the point. Exactly what prompted the underboss in question to order this course of action without authority from the boss himself is something nobody who understands organised crime is ever going to figure out. Hence, the whole film regards its audience as a bunch of morons.Another big problem for the film is that it cannot make up its mind what it wants to be. The central premise duels between comedy and mobster drama. The principal actors seem to think they are on a teenie soap opera. The editor seems to think he is meant to be making a lengthy epic. The director seems to think he is directing a music video. All of these elements combine to make an incoherent, unfocused pile of nonsense that must have been as confusing for the crew as it was for the audience. What little audience there was in theatres, anyway. Word about how terrible Gigli was spread so fast that after a mere two weeks in US theatres, Gigli limped away with a gross of six million and change against a fifty-four million dollar investment. Not surprisingly, the film was available on DVD-Video faster than most films finish their theatrical engagement. Martin Brest has not directed a film since, in spite of previously being involved in some solid works such as Beverly Hills Cop. In any case, Gigli soon became a job that everyone involved would rather forget.And the sad thing is that unlike Battlefield Earth, Gigli is not even bad in a funny way. It just basically sits there and shows you its offensiveness, as if mocking you for not only choosing a bad film at that particular moment, but for the fact that it managed to con various suckers into contributing more than fifty million dollars to its making. In that sense, it is like an Australian or British Prime Minister that nobody wants to be led by, but they just cannot get rid of. These days, it is all too easy for people who think they are connoisseurs of bad cinema, but are not, to label the director of a bad film the new Ed Wood. The thing is, Ed Wood consistently made films that were endearing in an especially terrible way because he was so enthusiastic to make films that he never noticed how bad he was at making them. The people involved in Gigli know they have made a bad film, and they have gone to great pains either to hide that fact, or to negate its presence in their resume. It is cynical film-making at its absolute worst. Even if it is so much fun to see Jennifer Lopez kill what is left of her unremarkable career.For that reason, I gave Gigli a one out of ten. It works best as a test of how much you and your bad film-loving friends can really endure.",

Unfortunately, a few are not available here in the US (such as the German film \"Daniel - Der Zauberer\"--which is currently #1 on this infamous list), but I have so far seen nearly half the films and have finally gotten to \"Gigli\". Unfortunately, after having reviewed almost 8000 films, I can honestly say I've seen at least a few hundred that were worse than this film. I honestly WANTED to hate this film as much as the reviewers and public hated this film but couldn't. I just didn't reach the proper level of awfulness a film should have to make the list. This actually is true of MOST of the films, as films that are popular to hate (i.e., recent films) are prone to make the list. And, classic baddies of the worst directors in film history (Ed Wood, Al Adamson, Hershell Gordon Lewis, William Grefe and Arch Hall) don't even make this hallowed list--mostly because their horrible films are only known to their small cult-like following.Please, however, do not get the idea I liked \"Gigli\". It is offensive, horribly written and dumb--but not quite rotten enough that I hated the film completely. No, it's the Ivory Soap of the movie world--I only hated 99.44% of the film.First and foremost, the film was written, apparently, by chimps. This is the only thing that could explain why so much of the film made absolutely no sense. The plot meanders everywhere and shows that the film was cut and re-cut and re-cut until it really was incoherent. Some plot elements appear out of no where and just vanish (such as the crazy lady who cuts her wrists) and some actors come and go--for no particular reason (the wonderful actor Christopher Walken appears as if most of his scenes were deleted--the one remaining seemed almost pointless).Secondly, and this is a killer for any film, the characters (particularly Ben Affleck) were unlikable. Affleck and Lopez cursed and cursed throughout the film, as did just about everyone. In addition, even for a rated R film, the dialog between the leads at one point in the film is quite intense--like we're listening to foreplay between the two. It certainly is special--and a bit embarrassing. Additionally, in a big mistake, these evil people later become nice--quite inexplicably--making their characters seem like caricatures. In fact, then entire final portion of the film made absolutely no sense at all and seemed to be there to fulfill the formula--but how the characters got from their unlikable selves to likable ones seemed to come from absolutely no where.Overall, an incomprehensible film that has a few nice moments but the whole is just an awful mess.",

            "content": "I just finished watching this movie about 10 minutes ago.  I rented it, because I wanted to know so bad what was it that people found so awful about it.  Well, I was pleasantly surprised.  It actually turned out quite good. Yes, all you stuck-up film scholars who think you've reached a regal status because you've seen \"The Godfather\" a couple million times--I thought it was pretty good!  Now, the film does have its flaws, but it doesn't have any flaws that the average film doesn't have nowadays.  Just to prove I'm not a studio exec disguising as a average moviegoer, I'll list those flaws first.Ben Affleck is never fully convincing in the title role, nor does he even seem to want to be in the film most of the time.  I took most of his outbursts as \"Get me off this film set!\" than him delving into character. But he's still watchable.  I just would never buy him as a gangster, and his swaggers and Italian-American accent are pure performance.  Jennifer Lopez, on the other hand, seemed more passionate about her role and played it quite well.  But, like Affleck, I would never buy her as a gangster.  And the whole lesbian subplot seems forced.  It's simply a ploy to get a rise from the audience when she (POSSIBLE SPOILER--I'm saying that strictly on a technicality) eventually falls in love with Affleck and \"crosses to the other side.\"  But she did provide much of the film's charm.  The newcomer who plays the mentally challenged character is one-note (he's no Sean Penn in \"I Am Sam\"), but I still felt sympathy for him.  The score is also what people have criticized.  It is pretty awful and overbearing at times, but that's a problem with a lot of scores nowadays.  The love story between J-Lo and Ben never quite gels and feels forced into the plot, and so do the character arcs.I think one of the main reasons this movie did terribly at the box office (other than the fact that audiences were tired of merely hearing the names J-Lo and Ben) was the way it was marketed.  I'm sure many people thought this would be a lighthearted romantic comedy.  Well, it's not.  It's a much more low-key drama with small elements of comedy and drama thrown in.  If this were made on a much smaller budget and was a tiny independent, I think people would hold less hatred towards it.  When people think studio films, they violence and sex or a combination of both.  There are many scenes in the movie which simply involve the characters interacting--something we don't see enough of in big-budget cinema.  That's right.  No explosions. No giant spectacles.All in all, the characters are likable.  I did like the heavy-set guy who played Affleck's boss.  Sure, the performances of Al Pacino and Christopher Walken are over-the-top, but still enjoyable.  The film is two hours long and I didn't feel it dragged in any way, which is a lot to say since some recent movies that are an hour and 20 minutes drag like hell.  And it does end on a happy note, amongst a crowd of bikini-clad women--that's always a good thing.  I did have a smile on my face at the end.I'm not saying this simply to rebel against the bandwagon.  A film like \"Glitter\" IS as bad as everyone says, and I could give a whole laundry list of reasons why.  \"Gigli\" is second-rate and certainly no gem, but it is worth watching.My score:  7 (out of 10)",

The movie is not tense, not emotional and for a comedy it is not funny enough. Basically it is a two hour movie about nothing.The cast is all wrong. Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez are simply not believable as 'tough' gangsters. And Jennifer Lopez seriously is the most unbelievable movie lesbian in history. And I don't mean unbelievable like in a compliment. I'm not one of those 'Bennifer' haters but as a fair neutral viewer of this movie I have to simply admit that they were awful, as was the movie in general. Cameo's from Christopher Walken and Al Pacino were the highlights of the movie. Seriously, Al Pacino's role is what make's this movie still a bit watchable. Also Lenny Venito was somewhat enjoyable in his villain role.The pace is also totally wrong. Most of the scene's are taking too long and are dragging on. The movie should at least had been halve an hour shorter. Also maybe if the movie had completely been made in comedy style it would had perhaps been a better or more enjoyable movie to watch.What was director/writer Martin Brest thinking?

            "review_title": "Here's a revealing statement, the goofy romance portion of this goofy romantic comedy is probably it's best part.",
            "content": "Now, that's a loaded sentence, if I've ever written one. Ben Affleck's and Jennifer Lopez's relationship is probably the most asinine and nauseating one discussed by supermarket tabloids since Carmen Electra and Dennis Rodman, and yet their romantic relationship in this prescribed failure of a romantic comedy is the most successful part of the whole movie. Keep in mind that you can take that a couple of ways. It could mean that it was done so well that it overshadows the rest of the movie, or it could mean that the rest of the movie is so bad that even the boring romance between these two people was better than everything else. That's all in the eye of the beholder, I guess, but for myself, I have to say that the necessity to watch the entire movie from beginning to end in order for it to be analyzed fairly is unfortunate. If you don't love hearing endlessly about Ben and J-Lo, you may very well have a hard time sitting through this one.For some reason that I don't pretend to understand, Ben and J-Lo each play hardened gangsters in Gigli (named after Affleck's character, who in turn is named such for no apparent reason), with Gigli a slightly younger and cockier thug while Ricki (Lopez) is sent along to keep an eye on him. You see, he's been assigned to the kidnapping of the mentally deficient younger brother of a federal prosecutor in the interest of preventing a deserved conviction. This part of the story I won't go into much, since it plays no role in the movie except to have a wispy string of plot along which to string lots of cute scenes with Ben, Jennifer, and, as Gigli charmingly calls him, `the retard.' The criminal plot in this movie is completely meaningless, it bobs it's ugly head above the surface briefly every 20 minutes or so just to remind you that it's there, and then disappears so Ben and Jennifer and argue over the superiorities of their respective genitalia.The reason that I say that the romance is the best part of the movie is because this is a film that follows every standard clich\u00e9 which should lead up to the typical odd-couple forced together by their work, so completely different that they can hardly stand each other, only to grow on and toward each other and ultimately reach some sweet, happy middle ground so they can kiss at the end with the sunset in the background while the orchestra picks up. But the reason that they have an extensive discussion of their genitals is because of Gigli's desperation to prove to Ricki, who makes it clear to him that she's a lesbian (and eventually, the audience learns that it's true, she's not pretending just because his first advance on her was so jaw-droppingly idiotic) that she has been missing out on the sheer wonders of the penis.This is a remarkably cleverly written scene, but whether you are male or female, gay or straight, you have to admit that it's hard to look past the fact (and I use the word fact purposely) that this is a scene with no other purpose but to have J-Lo gyrate and twist her body for the benefit of the passing camera, ending it with two words and a position that will have everyone in the room sweating. Now, I can hardly complain about this scene, except when you remember that these people are gangsters who have the kidnapped mentally retarded brother of a top federal prosecutor just in the other room (conveniently leaving them alone whenever the script doesn't need him around). The ability of the characters to forget what they're doing for extended periods of time is remarkable.So like I mentioned earlier, the crime portion of this movie is completely pointless except for three things - lots of cute scenes with the three main characters (I should say the one main character, played by Justin Bartha, and the two supporting characters, Ben and Jen), the cameo from Christopher Walken, and the cameo from Al Pacino, both of which are so good that they diminish the rest of the film beneath the weight of their presence. Not that there's much to diminish. You can tell how much thought was put into the film by such things as the fact that Affleck's character has a weird name literally for absolutely no other reason than to provide him a couple of opportunities to explain how to pronounce it (`It rhymes with `really...'). Kind of like how that idiot show on MTV Sorority Life derived much of its conflict (at least in the first episode, I could stand no more after that one) from the very fact that it was being filmed, Gigli is evidently named just so that the pronunciation will have to be explained.In glancing over the page on the IMDb for Gigli, I've noticed that it has earned itself a place near the top of the bottom 100 films of all time list. Not surprising, although I would not have expected that, even though I knew the film was a critical and popular disaster. Personally, I rated it a 6 out of 10, because while the film failed in everything it set out to do, it had some (2) wonderful cameos from some (2) wonderful actors, and there were also some genuinely amusing scenes involving Brian, the mentally retarded subject of the botched abduction. One scene, for example, featured Brian singing a song by Sir-Mix-A-Lot, which need not be named, since that guy only recorded one song, didn't he? Anyway, this scene is NOT one of the amusing ones. Not in the slightest. Who it was that came up with this little brainstorm and thought it might be funny I can not IMAGINE, but some of the other scenes were definitely amusing. See the scene at the end (unfortunately, you have to make it that far), where he first hears the voice of the girl he's about to dance with. The look on his face is priceless.I firmly believe that it's important to watch the really bad movies in order to truly appreciate the really good ones, and it's no secret that Gigli is definitely one of the bad ones. But there are different kinds of bad ones, there are bad movies like old horror films that have inadvertently transformed into comedies (many of these are sequels to relatively successful films, like Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street), there are movies that are made by immature idiots that take bad taste to unimaginably abysmal depths (such as the Scary Movies - this is the worst type of bad movie, by the way), and there are bad movies like the kind that you want to watch just because they are so famously awful that it's entertaining in itself to watch them just to see how bad they are. These are almost like feature-length sequences of outtakes. Battlefield Earth is, of course, at the top of this list, but also included are such crapfests as From Justin to Kelly and, of course, Gigli.That being said, I can't say that I would totally deter you from watching Gigli. It's entertaining, but before you watch it, keep in mind that it's exactly like David Spade - the only entertaining things about it are its weaknesses.",

Originally it was suppose to be titled Tough Love, which would have made sense for Ben Affleck's struggle to deal with Jennifer Lopez's character as a lesbian, or the idea that they are both growing attached to their mentally challenged hostage. Instead we have jokes regarding the name Gigli, which do nothing to advance any form of plot device. Ben Affleck stars as a gangster ordered to do a kidnapping. Jennifer Lopez is sent to make sure everything goes well. Then the story caters to Affleck's difficulties in bedding her because she's a lesbian. Director Martin Breast's work here is about as creative as a drunk during happy hour. He previously directed Scent of a Woman and Beverly Hills Cop. There is unnecessary footage such as a visit from Lopez's lesbian lover. Affleck plays a complete ass and Lopez cannot convince viewers that she is even a lesbian. Justin Bartha fares better as the victim but his sentimental outcome is long predicted. Al Pacino's role is basically ten minutes of profanity, which is understandable given the film itself. Christopher Walken plays a detective and is another actor whose career is smudged with this film. The film should be cut to pieces and used as toilet paper. Score: 0 / 10",

I think the biggest problem most people had with the film was the Dialogue. Some scenes were written to have a deeper meaning than most people are able to handle. The film had some lighter moments of Humor and some subtle references that the world is not what it always seems to be. Don't believe what most are saying... This film is not that bad. Give it a chance and if you don't at least crack a smile or Two... You are a humorless individual who needs to be put away on an Island for the humor impaired, and think deep like the dialogue suggests then you will find Gigli to be Enjoyable. The Performances by Pacino and Walken are at least worth the $4.000 rental charge at Blockbuster alone. 7/10",

What Affleck does not know is that he lacks confidence from his associates. Thus he unwittingly gets teamed with a red-hot lesbian assistant (Jennifer Lopez) who is there to make sure that he does the job that he has been paid to do. Writer/director Martin Brest (best known for \"Beverly Hills Cop\", \"Midnight Run\" and \"Scent of a Woman\") hits a creative brick wall here and falls hard. The dialogue between Affleck and Lopez is more times than not sexually-motivated and toes the line of being on par with something an adult film director might come up with during a dull evening sitting at home. The chemistry is nowhere to be found between our two leads and the running jokes could be viewed as downright offensive or just plain stupid. Bartha is a real scene stealer (he would go on to do quality work in \"National Treasure\"), but instead of being the central focus he takes a backseat to the picture's elementary tone and non-existent pace. Pacino (obviously owing Brest big time for his Oscar win in 1992) is wasted in a snarling and almost incoherent cameo that seems like a scene from \"The Godfather\" in some alternate \"Twilight Zone\" reality. Excruciating, dumb and totally forgettable, the less we talk about \"Gigli\" the better we will all be. Turkey (0 stars out of 5).",

Gigli, like its most terrible name, is one of the most forgettable and \"nothing\" movies I've ever seen. I mean, there is absolutely nothing here you can take with you or grow with or even remember. It contained an almost nonexistent plot, acting forced, cameos that must've made the actors embarrassed and promoted a clear bashing of the mentally handicapped and homosexual communities.I would love someone to challenge me. Please someone write to me and give me reasons this movie exists, for this is what I see from the actors:Justin Bartha supposedly plays a mentally handicapped person, but it's painfully clear he is just as handicapped as Gary Oldman's a dwarf in Tiptoes. Benny Affleck couldn't act in 2003, or in the 1990s or today. But, damn, he somehow tries to convince us otherwise. J-Ho\u0085so tough. I guess. But, here, she spits on the homosexual community and tries to convince us the \"lifestyle\" might be a choice. I spit back\u0085to her and the character known as Benny's mother in the movie. Christopher Walkens onto the set, mumbles his lines, tries to get us to know who he was and leaves before anyone recognizes him. Does anyone know who or what he was supposed to be all about? Al Pacino? Stop. It's bad enough that you are the King of Mocking Yourself with cameos. (SEE: Jack & Jill later in his \"career.\") I understand you owe a lot to Director Martin Brest \u2013 Scent of a Woman is one of my all-time favorites, after all \u2013 but, know when no means no.Funny. I had never even seen a trailer or a clip of Gigli and I knew instantly when it opened in 2003 that I never wanted to see it. Again, one of my favorite podcasts covered this, recently, so I had my homework \u2013 to watch it and then listen to the 'cast. But, if you do not listen to that internet program, How Did This Get Made?, then DO NOT SEE THIS.Is it the worst movie ever made? No. It was just so blah and, again, NOTHING. There is nothing to this movie. My guess on why they made this was to get J-Ho and Benny together, much like what they did to Al Pacino and Robert De Niro later in Righteous Kill. Neither movie is good or rememberable and was still backed by ignorant folk.Oh, I forgot (like they did) the plot: Benny's trying to prove himself as a gangsta by kidnapping Bartha's \"highly important mentally handicapped\" character. J-Ho's sent in to monitor via yoga and sexuality-changing and much less happens until the end. Oh, and Baywatch is to this movie as Judge Wapner is to Rain Man. Am I sad I saw it, finally? Well, it wasn't what I expected. I anticipated a terrible movie with awful dialogue and overacting. Okay, while all that's true, it's so incredibly blah and forgettable, it's not worth even recommending it as a \"so bad-it's good\" feature.Just Gee-lee your way away.* * *Final thoughts: I recommend the How Did This Get Made? podcast to accompany this if you do waste these two hours on this \"film.\" At least all that effort of staying awake will result in some laughter.",

To say that Gigli, sorry I mean \"Jee-lee\" if we're being pretentious, is a romantic comedy is the equivalent of stating that chlamydia is a health benefit.

Just \"Bennifer\" demonstrating their toxic relationship for all of us mere mortals to see, for pleasure. Excuse me while I casually cut both of my wrists with a kitchen knife (an actual \"comedic\" scene from the film...).So, what is the infamous Giggli all about? No idea. The plot is so bizarrely written and directed by Brest, that half the time I had absolute zero clue as to what was happening. Something to do with kidnapping a mentally challenged brother of a federal prosecutor. But who the actual frick cares about that insensitive onslaught of \"comedic ingenuity\". Brest didn't! His focus was having a straight man forcibly manipulate a gay woman into questioning her sexuality because romance. A-frickin-hilarious! With Affleck overacting every line of dialogue whilst shouting \"MAAA!\" every minute and Lopez still thinking she's \"Jenny from the Block\", there was no chemistry. I mean, there is an actual scene where she is performing yoga, talking about phallic sea slugs and her \"pussy\"? (Urgh, hate that word...). I can't.It was so bizarre. I just wanted the \"it's turkey time. Gobble gobble\". And I had to sit through two hours of nothingness and self-loathing to get there! Christopher Walken waltzed in for two minutes, adding nothing to the story! Al Pacino for frick's sake shouting his ass off like he's Tony frickin' Montana, shooting a guy in the head (in a romcom!!)! Why is there a Dido lookalike slashing her wrists? This isn't \"White Flag\"! Why the hell am I questioning this? With no romantic chemistry, no laughs and no plot, Jeegillgiligliy is essentially an insensitive mess that would rather focus on bulls, cows and pronouncing the frickin' title surname \"correctly\".

Between the mere two-week play date in the greater DC area, to the ridiculous skew in the IMDB voting, it is obvious that Gigli has become the subject of a witch-hunt. This is sad, for what the maddening crowds are missing is a film that hearkens back to Brest's more successful film Midnight Run, adding in a quirky romance with East Coast gangsters under L.A.'s palm trees. No, it is not perfect, but it is light-years more coherent than a Dude, Where's My Car, more emotionally real than an I Am Sam, and far better cast than a Road to Perdition. There were no witch-hunts for those films, and one was not warranted here. If you still have the chance, think for yourself and see this film, then see if you can still declare it a failure.

It is made up of multiple sequences of no score with heavy dialogue that tries to be like Tarantino.

The plot is ridiculous, everyone is miscast from start to finish, and it's over directed to the point of looking like nobody directed it, but the biggest culprit is the script. Characters come and go with no rhyme or reason and no motivation whatsoever, the dialogue is basically a series of bad monologues strung together. Nothing that happens is interesting, and nobody seems to know it.It's the equivalent of being on a blind date with someone that is telling a 30 minute story over dinner.

I thought the non-standard humorous parts were funny and rather intelligent, particularly a scene with an extremely odd police officer, played by Christopher Walken. The quirky script makes the story progress very slowly, however, with the risk of boredom - but the unpredictable nature of the film added a bit to the suspense. Perhaps also aided by the decent soundtrack, I was able to connect with the characters. I thought the movie was fair enough.Ben Affleck's character is an awkward and pathetic type, and I guess this gives a risk that such a flawed movie itself will have an overall awkward feel. It does, but not to a gigantic and ridiculous degree. The acting is never superb, but really not astonishingly bad either. Worse things happen at sea. The chemistry between Affleck and Lopez is very poor, but that sort of adds to the story. If you're looking for a turkey, this movie will probably disappoint you. I've seen far, far, far worse.",

Now that some time has passed and it can be looked at without the animosity and preconceived hatred of Ben and Jen, I think Gigli stands up pretty well. Let me say, at the time, I was not particularly a fan of Ben Affleck, nor was I then or currently a fan of J-Lo's singing or acting. I just thought the movie had a nice story, some funny dialog, and actually deserved better than it got from fans. For those who do not know, Affleck is Gigli, a wannabe mob stooge who is given the task of kidnapping Brian, the retarded brother of a government witness. Enter, Ricki, a lesbian assassin who is hired to ride herd on Gigli so he does not screw up. Gigli starts to fall for Ricki and she, despite her orientation, feels something special for him as well. The byplay between Affleck and Lopez is funny and its obvious they have chemistry (even if they eventually broke up). J-Lo's yoga routine alone is reason to own this movie. If there is a better explanation (and visual) of the difference between the male and female genitalia than the one J-Lo espouses while stretching in spandex, I have not seen or heard it. Justin Bartha (later to gain fame as Riley in the \"National Treasure\" movies) gives a pretty impressive performance as the mentally-challenged Brian. My biggest issue with this movie is the inclusion of Al Pacino as a gangster (talk about stretching yourself as an actor) At some point in his career, someone told Pacino that acting entails slowly raising his voice until he is railing at the top of his lungs. That's all he does in his movies. He just escalates his tone. That's not acting. That's a recipe for an ulcer. This movie is not going to change your life, but its also not going to end it.

Gigli just doesn't have the magic that The Room does. For the most part, it's bad because almost all of its comedy flops, and it's just a weirdly lifeless, boring movie......with a couple of exceptions, thanks to Christopher Walken and Al Pacino. They're both in the movie briefly for some reason, but each being an energy that's kind of compelling and fun. Walken especially might be the one thing preventing this from being truly irredeemable.I think it really has the reputation it does because of the talent involved, and the careers it sank, because reading about this on paper, you'd expect better. Beyond the cast, Martin Brest has made some very good films, particularly comparable crime-comedies like Beverley Hills Cop, Midnight Run, and the original/excellent/underrated Going In Style. Since Gigli's release in 2003, Brest hasn't made another movie, which is a shame. Unless of course he made a personal choice to retire from filmmaking, the idea that one bad movie should make you a filmmaking outcast isn't really fair.Anyway, watch the Walken and/or Pacino scenes on YouTube.

Hoffman he ain't.Fifth mistake: Jennifer Lopez.Al Pacino made the sixth mistake, not by appearing in this movie, but by doing Al Pacino.Seventh mistake: see Fifth Mistake.Supposed bad-ass gangster Gigli (Affleck) is sent by his boss, Louis (defiantly ugly Lenny Venito) to kidnap a federal prosecutor's retarded brother, Brian (Bartha), who is obsessed with \"The Baywatch.\" Stepping into Gigli's hideout/apartment comes Ricki (Lopez), a lesbian gangster whom Louis has also assigned to the kidnapping because he doubts Gigli's competence (you and me both, Louis). Gigli falls for Ricki (as any red-blooded guy who has a proclivity for lipstick lesbians is wont to do - to whit: Chasing Amy) and so begins an insufferable cultivation of Ricky's inscrutable vagina by Gigli.As with all Hollywood lesbians, Ricki is more than willing to betray her sex for some hot man-love, but there's a deeper betrayal going on - that of the movie betraying the male gender. The last scene depicts Gigli shedding a decidedly girly tear and letting Ricki drive off in his Merc, whereupon she promptly turns around and picks him up. Usually, the man is driving, the man is picking up the woman, the woman is shedding the tears. In reversing the gender roles, Gigli tries to get away with emasculating its main character - and fails, if public outcry against this vapid movie is any indication.Director Martin Brest, emboldened by his award-winning Scent of a Woman (1992) must have thought he was onto a winner with this cast - a veeeery public love affair between his leading couple and cameos by Pacino and Christopher Walken (who also made a mistake by appearing in this film, but salvaged his dignity by at least doing his characteristic Walken); instead, Brest shoots himself in the foot with a lackluster script, lusterless direction and the absolutely unconvincing concept that Lopez and Affleck could possibly be gangsters.Within the first ten minutes, there are about five blatant \"explanation\" monologues (dialog specifically inserted for the benefit of the viewer): explaining limousine driver lingo, explaining the plot, explaining the word \"excoriate\" (not only do we get the meaning of excoriate, the character feels the need to justify why he would even USE this word - because he is learning one word a day). Why does Brest insult us like this? Because he is talking to an audience who would voluntarily go see a Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck movie. That's how highly he thinks of you. Tragedy is, that demographic will not even realize they are being insulted, because - well, because they would voluntarily go see a Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck movie.You have been excoriated.

            "content": "Fact: A film where an overexposed celebrity couple that star together as a double act will always become a vanity project. Fact: Vanity projects in modern cinema simply do not work. Fact: Vanity projects bomb at the box office. Fact: Most of them include pop stars. And fact: Pretty much all of them absolutely suck.So imagine how I must have felt when I heard that Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck, were chosen to play in a role in a film that tries to rip off The Godfather. At first I though it was just a sick joke. However I was wrong and soon enough, Gigli was released.Now the critics gave Gigli an absolute slaughtering, the kind of panning that generates a kind of curiosity. \"Is it REALLY that bad?\". And of course with Gigli it's all justified. Gigli is the kind of embarrassment that people ought to should be hung upside down for. It's a truly appalling film.So why am I the latest person to give this film an absolute bashing? Because I've seen it, and from my personal view it deserves it. In other words, I watched this piece of crap so that you don't have to. And here's a low down of what I ended up watching for my \u00a35.Firstly, The Direction. Martin Brest (The same man behind Beverly Hills Cop and Midnght Run) is behind this movie, so talk about a guy with no excuse! It's difficult to understand what he was smoking when he gave the go ahead for this disaster, which goes wrong in so many ways that you can barely keep count of them. He's allowed the film to be completely shapeless. From The Plot, The Cast right down to the small and unimaginative scenes, it can only be described as an awful messy blot on his copybook.Secondly you have the cast themselves. Now we already know that Jennifer Lopez has modelled herself on Madonna's woeful pictures from day one, but Affleck (normally competent)is in way over his head. And worse still, veterans like Al Pacino and Christopher Walken turn in some very poor cameos. It's painful to think the lead in Scarface is being now bogged down in this commercial vanity fair guff.Then the story. Affleck, plays Larry Gigli, a dim bulb of a mob enforcer. Gigli has kidnapped mental patient Brian (Justin Bartha, doing Rain Man), the kid brother of a federal prosecutor, to keep mob boss Starkman (Al Pacino) from going to jail. Don't ask how. Know only that mob girl Ricki (Lopez), a lesbian with a suicidal girlfriend, has been sent in to make sure Gigli doesn't screw up. Lopez treats the role like a photo shoot, doing yoga exercises in Gigli's apartment and ruminating on why it's more erotic to kiss a vagina than a penis. I wish, I truly wish I was making this up.But then comes the dialogue. Welcome to hell. The dialogue enters \"Manos The Hands Of Fate\" territory in terms of sheer awfulness. Here's what I like to call the Three Crown Jewells in terms of this movies atrocious script.1) \"Turkey Time! Gobble Gobble\" During a bedroom scene! WHAT THE HELL?!2) \"Mooooo\" A cow noise that Larry uses to seduce his partner? We are still on planet earth aren't we? 3) \"It's more erotic to kiss a vagina than a penis.\" STOP IT STOP IT STOP IT! Gigli will stand for years to come as an example of how not to produce a love story movie. Gigli isn't even in the Freddy Got Fingred realm where it's so bad it's good. It's in the painful excruciatingly bad, almost like puncture wounds being inflicted in the cinema area.Manos The Hands Of Fate, may still be the worst movie of all time but it has got some powerful competition from Gigli. Oh and by the way, Gigli, rhymes with really. As in Gigli, Gigli bad. And one more thing, there's more than a dozen worse movies worse than this? Do us a favour!Don't Watch This Film.",

This film is far to un-pc for any major critic to get away with giving it a passing grade.  And yes, Lopez can't act. However, I went into the film thinking I was going to see some disaster, and instead, I got a nice surprise.  Ben Affleck gives a very good performance in this film.  Some of his lines had me laughing out loud, \"What the f- is this, mental illness week?\"  The \"turkey time\" line is so bizarre and out of place, it made me laugh out loud. The ending is a little slow paced, but the film has a good enough sense of humor and it's heart is in the right place. I smiled a lot in Gigli.  Christopher Walken and Al Pacino are a hoot. 8/10",

You ENDURE this thing, like an abscessed tooth. The most extensive vocabulary in the universe could not find words to describe the putridity of this film, but I will try.Let's see: The characters are unbelievable. The plot is a goof. The subplots are thin at best. Afleck looks like he's been hit over the head with a two by four. And what do you say about the acting talent of his fat butt leading lady? Only that in her case, \"acting talent\" is an oxymoron, like \"civilized divorce\".I don't know what I find the most revolting. The fact that this bomb cost 54 million, yes, kiddies, I said MILLION, dollars to make, or that some studio geek OKAYED it?! Afleck is a good actor. He's got some range, and a flair for comedy. But he walks around like a zombie. Perhaps this is how one looks when dying of embarrassment on film. Lopez must have some sort of, ahem, skills. She does seem to torture one male after another in her personal life. But she is a marginal singer, at best, and an ABYSMAL actress.Up until now, I thought the worst movie of all time was that Sybil Shepard horror, \"At Long Last Love\". That puppy kept the top spot for a long time on my list. But this complete disaster makes it look like \"Casablanca\".I'm a Catholic, so naturally I believe in Hell. I now have another reason to live a good life and not end up there. This odious waste of time you will not get back has got to be the number one film in Hell's Multiplex. If they'd used this thing in \"A Clockwork Orange\", Malcom McDowell would have been selling Bibles in about ten minutes.NEVER watch this film! It has NO redeeming moments! You will want to chug anti-freeze before the first half hour has D...R...A...G...G...E...D on by. On a scale of One to Ten, I give this a 12 Barf Bag rating. It's a wonder to me that mobs did not storm the theaters with torches for robbing them of nine bucks to see this mess.The only good thing you could do with this movie is to take every copy and give them all to really poor people who have no heat so they can burn them to stay warm this winter.

            "review_title": "Ben Affleck: Lesbian Converter",
            "content": "Ben Affleck must be the sexiest man on planet Earth. Not once, but twice, he's made staunch lesbians sleep with him (the first time was in Chasing Amy). What a guy. Pity, then, that the guy can't act. All the time he wears a look of extreme puzzlement, almost as if he can't believe what's happening. Well, he's not the only one.Where do I start when it comes to the stupidity of the cinematic trash that is Gigli? I guess Jennifer Lopez would be a start. She, along with Affleck, is contracted by the mob. Apparently she's some tough lesbian problem solver. Yeah, right. Lopez is about as threatening as fat-assed dancer. Oh, wait a minute\u0085 But anyway, even though she's a lesbian, you know that despite that and the fact that she and Affleck initially hate each other, they'll eventually end up in bed together. It's inevitable. But although that's merely worth rolling eyes, the way that she 'intimidates' a bunch of supposedly tough street thugs made me want to gouge my eyes out. How far am I supposed to suspend my disbelief? Okay, I can believe that Hollywood nitwits would spend $55 million making this swill and I can somehow manage to believe that Ben Affleck still manages to find work, but I can't believe that anyone would be threatened by Jenny from the block. What's she going to do, vogue you to death? And then there's the scene where she explains the beauty of the vagina. The dialogue is awful. Hideous. Rather than actually get into the real reasons why this character is a lesbian, we get a vagina monologue that is just as shallow, stupid and facile as Affleck's rant about his manhood. Neither of these people have a brain in their head. And the sex scene that follows is quite hilarious in the way that it emasculates Affleck's character. Essentially, he becomes J-Lo's bitch.But then there's Brian, the half-wit they have to baby sit. He's kind of like Rain Man, only cuter: instead of liking Jeopardy, he likes Baywatch; instead of whacking his head, he swears; and instead of indulging in a little relaxed dancing, he shakes his ass to rap. He's the kind of movie half-wit that allows us to gain important life lessons and grow as people. In other words, he couldn't be more fictional. In fact, I doubt he's even stupid. He has an unnerving knack for interpreting situations. Just take the moment where Larry has to cut his thumb off. At that precise moment, after a procession of scenes where he gets on Larry's nerves, he does his cute peekaboo act. Who'd want to harm him? Well, personally, I think Larry should have cut more than his thumb off.The cuteness, though, isn't only restricted to that scene. Brain gets Larry to read to him. But because Larry is a hard as nails mobster, one who's not to be trifled with, he's not familiar with the alien concept that is literature. He probably spends his leisure time doing gangster stuff. You know, fighting, fornicating and pumping iron (there's an awful scene where we have to endure the sight of Affleck slobbering over his physique. It's a sort of Travis Bickle scene, only infinitely more homoerotic. 'Want to see the horn?' No, thanks.). But back to Brian\u0085 To up the cuteness he asks Larry to read to him because it 'soothes him down'. What sort of person speaks like that? Let alone someone who is mentally challenged. But of course, Larry comes to love Brian. He even becomes a surrogate father. Isn't that nice? All a mobster needs to find the light is a half-wit and a lesbian.Of course, you could argue that Larry is the real half-wit in the film. He seems to think that if you shout 'stupid' and 'retard' at an idiot for long enough, they'll magically turn into Einstein. But then again, he does straighten a lesbian, so perhaps he has a point. However, Affleck is worryingly good at playing stupid. He even frowns when J-Lo tells him it's turkey time. He's perpetually perplexed.Someone who's less perplexed is Larry's mother. She's the crass but wise matriarch that may need her son to inject her in the ass but doesn't need anyone to tell her what's going down. Just after one look she knows that J-Lo isn't totally opposed to being with a man. Mothers know these things. And after talking to her for about ten seconds, in more sickening cuteness, she proclaims that she feels she knows J-Lo well. But bear in mind that she also refers to J-Lo as a, 'woman with substance.' Shows how much mother knows.But what makes the film even more depressing is the way that Christopher Walken and Al Pacino debase themselves in the name of a paycheque. Walken, gabbling something about ice cream, sounds like he's had a stroke and Al Pacino just turns the volume up. It's rather sad seeing these two great actors fall back on their familiar tricks.However, as bad as Gigli is, and it's very, very bad, it's at least the sort of bad film that you can point and laugh at. It's far too horrific to bore you rigid. But that doesn't mean it's so bad it's good. It's so bad it's trash.",

I am one of the very few people on earth to actually love such movies; this may be romance, but I am just trying to show that movies with pop stars \"can\" act.

            "content": "Let's face it everyone who is anyone has heard how supposedly BAD Gigli is. I don't think any film has ever received such rave BAD reviews and heckling and everything else but truly it was just the fad of the time to lash out at \"Bennifer.\" So it was only with the intent of seeing how truly bad Gigli was that I watched it and disappointedly it's not a bad movie at all. It isn't the best movie you're ever going to see, in fact don't hope to say that it's good but it's not bad and I don't think people hate it as much as they say they do.Gigli is the story of Larry Gigli, a low level mob grunt who does some petty dirty work for a big mob family. Gigli's higher up Louis dispatches him on a job to kidnap the mentally handicapped brother of a district attorney prosecuting the head of the mob family. Louis doesn't trust Larry to do the job right so he hires and sends someone to watch over the job and check up on them. Enter the beautiful and sexy lesbian Ricki. Larry is immediately taken with her and as they work together and pull off the kidnapping the two of them become closer. Larry finds himself falling in love and yet Ricki is out of his grasp. On top of that he has the kid brother in his care, Brian, who is annoying and gets in his way but of course is growing on him in a Rainman kinda way. When it comes down to it he has to make the choice to help two people who have become more of a family to him than anyone ever has, the woman he loves, and the kid he's been looking after.Let's start with Ben Affleck, the guy sucks. He can't act, and he's just a horrible screen presence who has been lucky enough to score enough films to make it big. Once in awhile he happens into a film with a good enough story and a big enough cast to make him worthwhile (ie: Sum Of All Fears, and Armageddon.) To try and pull off the role of an Italian mob guy is LAUGHABLE!! He never once shows any cruelty or the ability to be a bad guy, he's just mean and crusty. Jennifer Lopez is the better of the two, at least she can act but even still the role is entirely wrong for her. She's not believable as the mean bad mobster girl. They are both supposed to be killers. The storyline is good enough and fits together nicely and it wouldn't be a bad story if they had some better actors but hats off to the cameos. The fact that they got AL FREAKIN PACINO in this movie is unbelievable and crazy awesome. His brief yet funny role is perfect. Also Christopher Walken makes an appearance which is also a funny but brief role. The film has some very genuinely funny moments and great dialog (mind you so much of it is sexual innuendo but still funny.) The film is very much a man vs woman kinda movie in the same vein as Stepford Wives and there is some decent banter between Lopez and Affleck. Definitely one of the best scenes in the film, in fact, classic in my opinion is the scene with Lopez and Affleck where Affleck is trying to explain to Lopez why men are better than women for having sex, and Lopez's rebuttal to it. The scene stealer of the film is Justin Bartha who plays Brian. Although some might consider his portrayal as the handicapped kid as offensive it's never done offensively. His character is funny and smart and often pulls off a quip that takes on even Affleck's character. The ending is a little mish mashed and despite rumors this is not a romance movie. In fact the small amount of romance in the film between Lopez and Affleck is forced and kinda unbelievable. The film is a dark comedy that is just okay. I suggest renting it...if it's cheap :) 6.5/10",

BUT, but, but, but, that is a huge BUT, I can see why people don't like this film, and why I found it to be a bad idea as well as a bad film, the cast was beyond a mistake. First off, this movie was made during the time of the media craze of Bennifer, so it made it kind of annoying to see these two together again, but it's mostly Ben and Jennifer's acting \"abilities\" that kill the film. I'm supposed to believe that Jennifer is a \"tough\" gangster who does nothing to prove she is dangerous and that she is a lesbian? Not likely. Ben is also supposed to be a tough like New York accent dumb gangster? His accent was in and out during the whole movie. Also, did Christopher Walken and Al Pacino like owe Ben and Jennifer a favor? Because they so did not belong in this movie.Basically we have a screw up gangsta hit man who for some reason keeps getting hired instead of killed, Gigli(his name rhymes with really), he has to kidnap a retarded brother of a politician. But Gigli's boss thinks he needs to be watched by a hot lesbian gangsta, Ricki, who just refuses to sleep with Gigli, understandably, but he's a brat about it. Then his mom hits on her, very scary, and she ends up liking him anyways. But they end up liking the retarded kid and want to help him because they are now the tough hit men with a heart of gold? Now somehow this was turned into a ridiculous romantic comedy.Now Gigli like I said is not the worst movie I've seen, but it is a bad one. The only reason why I saw it was because I was so curious if it really was the worst movie of all time, is it? No, I wouldn't say so, but it is up there. The script was not at all well done, and very hard to believe. But for the most part it was Ben and Jennifer, I'm not saying that to hate on them, it's just a true fact. They were just the worst cast for a mafia type of movie, what was the casting agent thinking? I'm glad the Bennifer thing is over, but it's sad that Ben and Jennifer will always have to look at this moment in their lives and be teased about it, because if I have a bad weekend, I'm going to say it was \"Gigli\" bad from now on.1/10",

Granted, the last couple movies each has been in have been poorly acted and lacking anything remotely related to a decent story.  This, film, however, doesn't require either to completely carry it.  The story and some extremely funny situations that make them seem like they could do comedy (which neither can) kept me interested throughout.The writer and director deserve a huge amount of credit for coming up with a story that fit both and then letting them more or less be themselves.Going in, I thought this was just another throw the stars together and collect the bucks movie.

There are some movies which fall into the \"so bad they are good\" category, like \"Showgirls,\" \"Duel in the Sun,\" etc. \"Gigli\" is not one such film. It has the reputation of being one of the worst films of all time, and that reputation is well-deserved. Usually, I can sit through a movie at least once even if I hate it. This is one movie that I could not sit through. An afternoon in the dentist's chair is more appealing to me than watching this film, and I am not kidding. The issues with this film are numerous, and have been well-documented. One, is the complete lack of chemistry between the two leads. Considering that they were a mega-couple at the time and inspired one of the most famous couple names of all time, you'd think J-LO and Affleck would actually have chemistry on-screen. Well, you would think so, but you would be very, very wrong. It's been years since Bennifer was a thing, but the two have zero chemistry as a couple on-screen and you have to wonder where their supposed passionate love affair was reflected, because there's no sign of it here. The title is another issue. For years, I thought the name of this was \"Giggly.\" Well, color me surprised when I found out it was not! Live and learn. I'm not sure why exactly two Oscar winning actors like Pacino and Walken are in this film. Did they lose a bet? Did they need money at the time? Did they not read the script before agreeing to be in this? I found myself pondering these questions so much that I could not even focus on the film itself- although judging by what other people have said, I didn't really miss too much. I cannot help but feel sorry for director Martin Brest here. The guy went from directing quality films to directing this mess, and has not directed anything since. He also wrote the film, but creative control was taken away from him here so it was not the film he'd originally envisioned. So I give him a pass there. So, my final advice when it comes to \"Gigli\": eat glass instead of watching this. It will be less painful.",

Lo showing up is waste of time and slow the film. Some dialogues could have been cut short, but I found many funny and witty. In the scene with Walken, Lopez can be seen as really worried. On the other hand in the scene with Pacino, she is little too scared or surprised for a contract killer. The main problem is that Lopez as a mob enforcer is not believable.",

OK so it's not the worst film ever made its more like the 786th worst ever made, which considering how many movies there are that is saying quite a lot. The film is labeled as a romantic gangster comedy (3 genres that go together like bread and butter and bleach). Well let's see how it fails at being all 3 genres.Romance- Ben and Jennifer, despite going out at the time, have zero chemistry. Unless you find watching a loud mouthed homophobe and a stereotypical lesbian hooking up romantic.Gangster- the gangster stuff is completely watered down and the whole gangster plot is polluted with plot holes.Comedy- if you find jokes at the expense of the mentally disabled and lesbians funny than your kind of comedy.

The film can be funny in one instant and then, one of the saddest movies you have ever seen. I think that is what makes for good drama, to be able to balance so many emotions and still tell an important story. I will be honest, I laughed quite a bit during this movie, but I cried more. I cried like a baby, because the chemistry of Ben and J-Lo was that damn good. I know it is early to start talking Academy, but it must be addressed.

Many people were sick of hearing and reading about Ben & Jen on the news, on tabloid covers, in the newspapers, etc. Those that were tired of the couple saw to it that the movie would fail. Those that wanted it to fail should be very happy because their wish came true. To call Gigli a bomb is an understatement.Is it the worst movie in the world? I don't think so. This movie has some big name actors that did their best to try and make it work. The plot was OK too. So what went wrong? The real downfall of the movie was the dialog. This can be overcome when movies are exceptional in other areas. Titanic and the Matrix sequels had terrible dialog and a weak story, but they were both commercial success because they had good special effects. Gigli's problem is that it isn't exceptional in other areas, so there is nothing in the film to offset the terrible dialog.Bad dialog is a real problem in movies. Every good movie has to suspend your disbelief so you forget you are watching a movie and you get engrossed.

            "content": "In all seriousness, Gigli turned my life around. I never dreamed of being able to enjoy a film starring either Jennifer Lopez or Ben Affleck (let alone the both of them together) but Gigli really proved me wrong. My crippling aversion to Jennifer and Ben has now been cured and I am even able to watch crap like \"Paycheck\" or listen to \"Jenny From The Block\" without feeling the need to projectile vomit. Thank you, Martin Brest! Gigli is by no means as horrendous as its reputation would suggest. The film was obviously a victim to the most terrifying phenomenon of recent times - \"Bennifer\". I believe it was that word more than anything else which sparked the critical massacre unleashed upon Gigli. I really think that everyone was (justifiably) sick of the pair and just wanted to see them fall on their faces. An unusual choice for a starring vehicle and some very quirky dialogue just added more fuel to the critical fire. The irony is that Gigli is the best thing that either Jennifer or Ben have ever done.As a fan of bad movies, I was hoping that Gigli would be terrible on biblical scale. There are cringe worthy moments and jokes that land painfully askew but these are heavily outweighed by genuine moments of hilarity. In my opinion, the scene where Brian sings \"I Like Big Butts\" in a morgue is just one example of the film's comedic genius.My last hope of hating the film was the much maligned \"lesbian conversion\". However, this scenario is handled with such sensitivity that I'm shocked that anyone has had an issue with it at all. Ricki just doesn't wake up one day and say \"praise the lord, I'm no longer a lesbian\". Ricki makes it clear from the beginning of her tryst with Larry that she still considers herself to be a lesbian and continues to describe herself as such for the rest of the film. I am appalled at the narrow minded mentality of several IMDb reviewers who find it preposterous that a lesbian could have a fling with a man and still consider herself gay. I wont even bother with the claims that Jennifer is too hot to be a lesbian. Seriously people, it's time to leave your trailers and make a pilgrimage to your local gay community.It is a shame that the Razzie awards jumped on the Gigli hate-wagon and bestowed Jennifer and Ben with worst actor awards. As much as I hate to admit it, they were both great. Ben has made a career of rehashing his Good Will Hunting performance, but his gruff, tough guy routine really sits well with this character. Ben also imbues Larry with a sense of confusion and insecurity that feels very real. The look on his face when Ricki asks him to be \"her bitch\" is priceless. Jennifer likewise does a great job in a very difficult role. She has to deal with the film's most deliciously bad dialogue, from the mind boggling vagina speech to a ludicrous rant on how to rip out an eyeball. Somehow Jennifer carries all of this off with style. The Razzie voters really need to get out more.Justin Bartha and Lainie Kazan also deserve a mention for their great turns. Justin does a brilliant job as the intellectually disabled hostage. He is endearing and funny without being a caricature. The always brilliant Lainie Kazan makes a very funny cameo as Larry's mother. She really deserves a much higher profile. Al Pacino and Christopher Walken are on auto-pilot but hardly worthy of the worst supporting actor nominations they received.There is a lot to enjoy about this movie. It's funny, offers some great performances and contains a Baywatch subplot. I'm not sure what more you could possibly want from a film. I would recommend Gigli to anyone with a quirky sense of humour, you might just be surprised. It's enough to make you wish for a \"Bennifer\" reunion. Well, not really.",

Some critics have even said it is the worst film ever made.  My question to them is... how many movies have you actually seen?This is not to say it is a good film.  The plot is worthless and is only there to bring Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez together for an entire film. An appearance by Al Pacino is the film's best moment.  And Ben and J. Lo are hardly adept \"contractors\".  But this is not a bad movie, and certainly not one of the worst movies ever made.  The dialogue actually has a bit of charm to it--even the \"It's turkey time.  Gobble, gobble.\"  Perhaps because the audacity to even try a piece of dialogue like that made me laugh.  But in that scene, J. Lo is not seducing Ben, more like she is offering him a challenge.Some scenes hurt like hell to watch.  Some scenes are just plain boring. But every so often, a scene comes out of nowhere and surprises you with its wit and inspiration.  Take a scene where J. Lo argues the superiority of the vagina to the penis as a sexual device.  It's quite possibly one of the most hilarious, yet erotic monologues I've ever heard.  And I don't even think J. Lo is all that sexy!I don't feel like spending a lot of time talking about this movie--it really isn't very good.  But I do recommend it, simply to counter all the negativity around it.  While I never once believed either of the actors to be contract hitmen (or whatever they are), there is a definite zaniness and originality to the film.

The revisionist gangster theme was welcome - for once these 'tough' guys are not proving their mettle in pointless violent scenes. Jo Lo enters the story calmly telling us she can kick Ben's butt, but gladly the story did not provide us with any cheesy fight scenes. People say that Ben was unconvincing as a thug - well wake up, that was the point! He has a feminine side that Jo Lo sees, and likes him for. It is never explicit as his character would never have admitted to it openly, but it is fielded between them. The Jo Lo character has real character, and handles all the men in the story with grace and ease; she is always calm and keeps a wry smile as the various men in the story posture and say how tough they are. She can see right through the bravado, and handles each conflict differently, but always with the ease and capability of someone of secure character. She does not end up as a converted lesbian as many reviews portray, and unlike Chasing Amy. She has been with men before and does not change here. The theme is the teasing out the feminine side of the 'not really so tough guy' Affleck.Now, American audiences seem to miss subtlety - many British sit-coms and movies are re-written for America - making the humour and sub plots more 'on the nose' because they are missed entirely in the States. So yes, Affleck is not convincing as a thug - he is not supposed to be. Jo Lo is actually bi-sexual as the film clearly tells us, rather than lesbian as she claims. Look more carefully. She is also the most mature character, and very capable - she is more the man than any of the other characters; which is why she prefers female lovers. The rest of the story is by the by; so don't expect development of exciting plots as this is about people. Various characters come and go as we are seeing a slice of life rather than a rounded Disney story. For some reason everyone expects Al Pacino or the other characters to keep coming back. Well life does not provide nice little events with a beginning, middle and end-with-character-development. Life is a series of scenes that are disjointed, and without resolution or closure. The character is the crucial element and Afflecks is carefully and implicitly aired between the lines. Not every film should bang its black and white dialog right on the nose.",

Besides Brians historical disability highlights even the other characters more social disability of 'unsocial', onesided traits of 'autism'. While they have to play unchanged their part, the members of the 'family'-team Brian, Larry and Ricki develop tools to take care their disability.The mysterious out-of-the-blue Ricki is gentleminded, beautiful and must be \"someone who can look you right in the eye and tell you exactly what she's thinking, someone who doesn't care what you think about her.\" With her sense of coolness, and logic she can see through the front-mirrors in this Gigli-movie. It is precisely this what Larry's show-off attitude needs for his development. Brest about Larry Gigli: \"The most important thing was to create a central character who is stuck in time, who has somehow missed the opportunity to grow and progress\u0085 a man that time forgot, someone who, despite his good looks and charm, lives in the past and is a bit removed from his contemporaries\u0085His peers have moved on, gotten married, started families, and Gigli is still at his two-bit job, living alone in a dumpy apartment. Somewhere along the way, he took the wrong road and he's stuck. So he postures, covers up, tries to pretend he's a tough guy.\" For Brian is 'Baywatch' not the TV-show but the life where normal people are, not longing to be part of it, he is aware of his situation, but be accepted for what he is. His togethertime with Larry and Ricki gives him the tool to handle 'Baywatch'-reality when he finally is a part of it. Not the goal \u0096 the journey transforms this timeout-'family', offers human approach to each other. The lesson: if each one of them accepts the other, the lesbian, the tough guy and the handcapped can be handicapped, lesbian and the tough guy. When Brian has finally to proof the use of his tool as short-time-member of the 'Baywatch'-team \u0096 it does not happen in Rainman's autistic \"wet kiss\"-style, though Brian cites for the astonished girl the Australian weatherforecast, Brian uses the right tool for the right person in the right moment at the right place; tool, person, time and place interact together. To be disability-accepted is mainly \u0096 not only!!! \u0096 the responsibility of society, but foremost the confronted individual in focus \u0096 here it is the girl. Not Larry Gigli is the turning-point in this 'bad' Gigli-movie but Brian. They search for and find a way to communicate with Brian, sensing what to do, has to be done and is done until Brian is ready when 'Baywatch' opens. After the Starkman-scene everything is done and said. Being Peace rules. Brian is, until his brother and his people come, a 'Baywatch'-member. And Larry is ready, as good as it is possible for him, catching up time and the others. And Ricki reveals her real name, inviting him to be with her, to be wherever it is 'clean' and as long as it lasts for them. The book Rochelles Ricki reads is Being Peace by Thich Nhat Hanh. The first lines of the first chapter On Suffering highlight what the movie Gigli aimed at. Without denying suffering, Brian and Ricki show Larry-boy how a 'father' could be, seeing the wonders of life. \"Life is filled with suffering, but it is also filled with many wonders, like the blue sky, the sunshine, the eyes of a baby. To suffer is not enough. We must also be in touch with the wonders of life. They are within us and all around us, every where, any time\" Being Peace Thich Nhat Hanh",

I said it because, well here's the catch, Ben and Jennifer were dating back when this movie was made and someone felt it was a great idea, if this movie, which started as a sort of a crime comedy would be turned into a romcom, because, hey, Bennifer was the hottest thing of the week in the land of dreams. And thus we see, how Gigli beds the lesbian.The film doesn't seize to amaze me, as it has pretty good supporting cast. There's Pacino and Walken there, but only thing they do is their classic \"look, I raise my voice and am menacing\" bits and then they're out. And we get back to the romcom. Even a suicide attempt of Rickis crazy ex-girl is left as \"whoops, look what just happened\" moment.As I said, this movie has some bits, that are good. While you watch it you can see another path, which would lead into a bit better film than this is, but the path is left alone and we are shown a story, that is more predictable and boring than anything else.",

            "content": "Gigli. It rhymes with really.While some may have dismissed the film all too quickly, I gave it a chance to prove to be something worthwhile. And you know, it wasn't as bad as I've been lead to believe.But I would be lying if I said that it wasn't still fairly bad.It seemed like Martin Brest just wanted to try and bank on the current state of gangster films. He throws around the f-word like it's nothing. Like he's having a blast just writing it. No substance, no conventional need for it in the least. This man is no Quentin Tarantino. The faster he realized this fact, the faster this film may have been saved.Ben Affleck must have been choked by Brest at some point too. Because he had the stupidest drawl/accent (maybe he argued with the idiocy of the script?). It was just utterly ridiculous, and gave Heath Ledger's speech tactic in Brokeback Mountain a run for its money.And while J'Lo is hot, she just can't do the whole lesbian thing. You can tell from a mile away that Chasing Amy syndrome is going to come up at one point, and that Affleck will eventually have his way with her (after a long discussion about she's proud of having her \"p---y\", and how women know how to have sex better than guys because of their two pairs of lips no less).And what the hell! I'm watching, and random cop shows up at Affleck's door. He opens it, and who pops up? Christopher Walken. He walks in, and starts chatting away and leaves within five minutes, never to be seen again. And he doesn't swear once. The whole movie has every character swearing, and he doesn't say one bad word. And then the movie progresses, and there's mention about the mobster who initiated the kidnapping of the mentally handicapped guy (did I forget to mention that stupid plot device?). And he shows up at the end of the movie because he's angry at them about a thumb they didn't cut off. And who is it? It's Al Pacino! And he has a ponytail. But he swears. And let me tell you, he makes up for Walken's lack of swearing. He blows a guy's head off for his error in this, and then he goes to kill Ben and Jen, but the lesbian talks him down with ease. Like, did I miss something here?Did I mention some of the dialog? It's a wonder Brest has yet to have an Oscar in his bedroom.*lies back, spreads legs* \"It's turkey time\" \"Uh?\" \"Gobble, gobble\"\"F--- you!\" \"No, f--- you!\" \"F--- you, this is my f---ing house!\" \"F--- you, stay out of this!\"This is followed by a random, yet obligatory lesbian wrist slitting.But wait. I forgot adding the humor of having a mentally handicapped kid singing \"Baby Got Back\" for no apparent reason at all.If I continued pointing out just how much trouble there is with this film, I think I'll have made the film actually seem somewhat decent.And it's not.Overall, it looks like the completely disjointed script is to blame here. And what's sad is that it could have been made into something if it got a good polish and wasn't so utterly stupid. Even the slightest polish would have helped this film. Like this is Martin Brest. He gave us Eddie Murphy's key 80's film, Beverly Hills Cop. And he got Pacino his one and only Oscar, for Scent of a Woman.So what in the hell happened here?In the end, it has some watchability, if only for the fact that it's absolutely horrendous, and shows almost every little thing that you should not do in a major Hollywood film to secure some sort of good box office receipt. And plus, Walken and Pacino show up, even if they cannot save the movie from its inevitable oblivion.3/10.",

Lopez is sorely miscast as lipstick-lesbian assassin-for-hire (!) who is brought along to baby-sit screw-up Affleck who insists on falling for her even as they argue about procedures of the professions. Truly awful dialogue, painfully terrible acting choices (Affleck's in-and-out Jersey cum Brooklyn 'dese dem and dose' accent is ridiculous) and no chemistry to be displayed hinders an already cringe-worthy hybrid of 'Prizzi's Honor', 'Rain Man' and 'Chasing Amy' concocted by filmmaker Martin Brest (who in his defense has done far superior work with 'Midnight Run', 'Beverly Hills Cop' and 'Scent of a Woman') causes speculation as to What the Hell Went Wrong?

Let me start this off first by saying that i usually don't enjoy films of this nature and I think with each film Jenifer Lopez becomes a better actress. I would also like to go on record as saying that my expectations were not very high and I really detest Ben Affleck.  But in respect for the public I've gotta call'em like I see'em and Gigli is a keeper. The movies is completely original and although it falls into some cliches you can never tell one scene from the next. There's perfect continuinty and adequate and sexy chemistry from the two leads. Jenifer Lopez stars as Ricky  an unattainable lesbian contract killer and Ben affleck whose actually pretty good stars as a contract killer. They join for a job where they have to kidnap and hold the mentally retarted brother of an important official. At this point your probably scratching your head saying whatever. But the film actually unwraps quite well. It's a lot of fun to see the sexual dialogue from the two charachters run up against eachother as they fight theie undeniable attraction.  And the film although quite bleak and dark remains upbeat and heartful. I'm not saying Gigli is the best film of the year or even on the top ten.

It has good supporting cast, occasional nice plot-twists etc. Nothing too cheesy or stupid or any other usual stuff that make movie 1 point smth material.I'd give it 5,5 points, but due to the IMDb's uncomfortable voting system i give it benefit of the doubt - 6 points.",

His acting in the part is so wooden and forced is makes the acting from Revenge of the Sith look like The Godfather caliber.But this in itself is not saying anything. Much of Affleck's career has been plagued with clich\u00e9'd performances (although at times this is not as much his fault as it is the screenwriter's or director's), although this one really tops it all. He makes Larry Gigli (like really!) come across as a complete and total (stupid) jackass. But like I said though, this is more the fault of Marting Brest--the writer and director of this nonsense. I don't know what his definition of 'dialog' is, but the fact that the f-bomb is dropped after every other syllable does not make a good screenplay, nor does it make a character sympathetic.When one views Jennefer Lopez in her role in this movie, you might think that her scantily clad body is something that saves this film from being a crime against humanity. I'm sorry to all the men out there, but it doesn't. Her acting and dialog is so atrocious that it leaves a bad taste in the back of your throat (for which I hope you bought the large Coke). It completely turns you off when in fact it was Brest's goal to turn you on.Speaking of Martin Brest (who treats film stock like toilet paper in this, or maybe I'm being a little harsh), it's still hard for me to believe that he weaseled all of these high class actors into the picture that can actually act worth a damn. I don't know what was going through Al Pacino's or Christopher Walken's head when they agreed to appear in this, but I've finally reached the conclusion that there is not one thing in this film that could not involve illegal substances.",

Why do we want to watch a movie that was probably only made to capitalize on when they were? Next up, JLo plays a lesbian, but she continually flirts and banters with Ben, so it's pretty obvious they'll wind up in bed together. How is that old stereotype, that all a lesbian needs is the right man, something enjoyable to watch? Third, which is a criticism in the same vein, in order to simultaneously entice him and push him away with her disinterest and independence, JLo gives a monologue about how every man and woman is actually a lesbian-while practicing her yoga. Then, after the inevitable happens and they do wind up in bed together, Ben says something that's supposed to be funny, but due to the recent transgender movement, would give crickets a louder sound than laughter in a modern audience.Unless \"Bennifer\" was your favorite couple and you're devastated that they broke up, there's no reason to watch this movie.

Say it with me\u0085 just because two people work off screen does not mean they will on as well. Both of them having a poorly done accent each doesn't really help. The plot is never engaging and consistently utterly uninteresting. The pacing is drab. For the entirety of this picture, nothing whatsoever happens. This overstays its welcome something fierce. The language really felt thrown in, without any actual point to it. There are aspects of this that are just offensive. Walken and Pacino must be kicking themselves. Not a single scene is captivating or entertaining. The dialog is largely unimpressive, and holds no memorable or quotable lines. It also tries far too hard to sound eloquent.

Not to leave the review without any criticism, I thought a good deal of the movie could've been left on the cutting room floor.  The sheer number of highly enjoyable scenes should've been the focus of the movie.  It reminded me of Kurosawa's \"Dreams\", which was packed full with memorable, vibrant imagery and storyline; but made you endure minutes after minutes of nothingness. Okay, the \"Dreams\" comparison was a bit of an exaggeration; but that's the ballpark that Gigli ends up with.  More spotlighting of the quality moments and less time for the filler would've gone a long way.",

It's been faulted for the screenplay, but it's not that terrible...there are some clever lines here, certainly enough to warrant the movie's existence. And, of course, everyone hates the way Ben and Lo act, yet their acting comes off fine--they goof off one another and have fun with the confrontations.

They happen all the time so all the negative hype was really uncalled for. Lopez' character just doesn't work. It makes no sense. Affleck's actually does. It's your average idiotic young hood and I think he pulled it off. He's actually kinda funny. This movie reminded me a little bit of Excess Baggage. But that one was a little more interesting. The problem with something like this is that you can't figure out when it went wrong. It wasn't the actors and the whole premise seems a little silly so I figure it happened before the actors even got there. But why Ms. Lopez agreed to play this character with that dialogue has got to be the $64,000 question. But I don't think these two should have gotten railroaded the way they did. Neither one of them is a bad actor, even in this. If you haven't seen it I'm not going to recommend it but I saw a movie that was a lot worse than this last week and I had no warning. Be Cool was awful, but there was no backlash against the stars, so I had no idea. I'm not trusting critics ever again and neither should you.

And from all that we got one of the worst movies of 2003.I've said many times that I don't feel Ben is a good actor and he did nothing in this movie to change my mind. Whereas Jennifer has been able to hold her own in some movies. But the two of them together in this? Sorry. It just didn't work. There was no real chemistry between them although part of that might have to do with the plot.He plays a young man in the mob who one day is charged with kidnapping and holding the nephew of a judge or governor or some important person as leverage in a court case. Jennifer is then sent to keep an eye on Ben because he's a bit of a screw up. She's also a lesbian so she's got no interest in him. But as time goes by she falls for his charms and they wind up together.If there's one good thing I can say about this movie it's the presence of Christopher Walken. He plays a higher up in the mob and while the movie is crap, his scenes are always a breath of fresh air. He's so bizarre and entertaining in his scenes that he at least makes those scenes interesting. Seriously they're the only good parts of this trainwreck.",

Now that some time has passed, maybe that's why its worth defending to a certain degree. I've seen MUCH worse movies, seen two leads have MUCH less chemistry and certainly listened to worse dialogue (although it IS profoundly over-written at times but I'd rather listen to that than having to hear clich\u00e9-ridden, idiot-plex-pleasing garbage).Ben plays Larry Gigli, who works for Nick. Nick kindly requests Larry kidnap Brian, the mentally-challenged brother of a federal prosecutor, in hopes that the prosecutor will no longer do his job on behalf of an associate of Nicks. Unbeknownst to Larry, Nick also assigns Ricky (Lopez) to this particular case so they can keep an eye on each other and on Brian. Larry is insulted that a woman has been put in place to question his authority and professionalism, because he's a self-described 'gangster's gangster' and has the Henry Hill/Chili Palmer wardrobe to prove it. Since Ricky is not leaving, he invited her to share his bed and when he makes a move on her, she rejects him cause she's gay. They then spend a good deal of time pointing out the pluses and minuses of the male and female sex organs and their own preferences, but naturally there's an attraction between them.She rejects him with her words but her face indicates otherwise. She also accuses him of being gay, which infuriates him of course.Various other people enter the story at different points - Larry's mother, played by a funny Lainie Kazan; Ricky's lover, and Chris Walken, whose five minute cameo serves only to annoy. Then there's Al Pacino, who seems to be re-working Tony Montana by way of Truman Capote.Affleck is at his best, for me, when he's being emotionally generous and vulnerable. When he expresses his frustration at having a beautiful, unavailable woman in his bed, he expresses it in a very macho way but you know he could shed a tear at any moment. Similar to a scene from \"Chasing Amy\" which happens in a car also. But this time its funny and sad at the same time. I did learn some things watching this movie. I learned you can remove at thumb from a corpse with a plastic butter knife....? I learned the difference between answering a question with the answer 'yes' or the answer 'sure.' I learned how men are supposed to check if their fingernails need trimming.Its not all good. But I'm not getting into specifics since as I've pointed out, this movie has already taken too much of an unfair beating already. 8/10.",

That said, it is also far from being good.  It's just a sloppy story with some very unfunny and silly jokes.

The retarded guy definitely gets on your nerves after awhile, and Ben and Jen's bad accents don't help.  The film is actually slightly decent during the cameo performances by Christopher Walken and Al Pacino, who I bet is regretting doing this favor for Martin Breast right about now.  The chemistry between the two leads isn't electric, but there have been worse couples in film history.  Basically, it IS a bad movie.

Al Pacino signing off on it. That's right, Al Pacino. The same guy who gave us cinematic gold in \"Scent of a Woman\", also directed by Martin Brest, agreed to be in this. Why, oh why?! To his credit, it's probably the only scene in the movie worth watching.And as far as the aforementioned Martin Brest is concerned, how can the same guy who gave us \"Beverly Hills Cop\", \"Scent of a Woman\" and \"Meet Joe Black\" have made this? I truly feel bad for the guy as I've not seen one upcoming director's credit for him since this bomb came out. It appears to have been career suicide for him.Overall, I'd say to avoid this movie at all costs. Don't even watch it for free on TV, if it ever even plays on TV.

Because Larry is such a wet sandwich gangster, he gets a surprise visit from Ricki (Jennifer Lopez) whom he resents at first, but, of course, they end up in the sack together. Things get ugly when Starkman (Al Pacino) arrives, kills Louis (Lenny Venito), and tells Larry what an embarrassment he is, but Larry and Ricki quit and take Brian to \"the Baywatch\". Gigli is one of the most oddly-concocted films I have seen, with an ill-conceived story, bizarre subplots, and performances so off-collar that the actors look confused at what's going on. Ben Affleck seems more focused on acting like an egocentric douchebag than a lesser mob man and J-Lo, despite playing a badass bodyguard, comes off as just a special needs caretaker with a hot bod. Pacino is even worse, overacting in every sentence and emphasizing every four-letter word. However, Gigli's saving grace is Justin Bartha as Brian, who is desperate to lose his virginity yet has to take abuse from Larry in almost every scene. A very special shout-out goes to Christopher Walken and his awkwardly hilarious switch from a serious interrogation to a 20-second monologue about pie. Gigli is such an odd egg to sit through and is one of the classic examples of a bad romantic comedy. (1 Marie Calendar Pie a la Mode out of 5) (It's turkey time... Gobble gobble.)",

And it's gigli gigli bad.Look, friends: I've seen a lot of B-movies before. But they all had budgets that couldn't buy 2 Big Crunches at KFC. This? This had a fifty-four million dollar budget. And it got a pitiful amount back. And here's why. In this film, there is a vacuum of emptiness where humour, good plot, and chemistry are meant to fill. Gigli fails at all of these. Bennifer's love scene has absolutely no nudity and it's utterly unbelievable since J-Lo's character is supposedly a lesbian. With the lack of chemistry between them, it would be not surprising if Ms. Lopez gave birth to furniture. As for the plot, it's cringe worth. Affleck is forced to keep care of a retarded kid. But pretty much nothing happens. It's just LONG and DULL. And the humour? Please don't get me started on that. Ninety percent of the laughs are completely unintentional. But the pace is the worst! Several scenes push the 10 minute mark. Now, that would be okay if it wasn't boring. But it is. In one of these scenes, Al Pachino (!) appears and has a speech in a length that rivals a Macbeth soliloquy. I eventually got so frustrated I switch to the channel above for air and (praise god) Red Dragon was on.

Oh how the mighty have fallen!Despite what I just spewed, \"Gigli\" is not the worst film of all time as it's often hyped to be but it's a runaway winner for the most abysmal film of '03.

Actually, they receive a lot of exposure but not to the point they're making headlines every day.So \"Gigli\" got a limited release, which will qualify it to a DVD release. There were a few posters in the streets of Paris, almost the only place where it was screened. After a week, bye bye \"Gigli\".  I went to see this movie because of my own guilty pleasure in very bad movies, a hilarious feature in \"The Onion\" (about sneak previews reactions) and the idea of hearing J-Lo saying \"penis\".I admit that \"Gigli\" is indeed bad. It might not be the worst movie of this year (for instance, it has some kind of coherence, a plot and actors trying to act, compared to \"The Matrix Reloaded\") but it's bad. There are a few good things in it. There are some scenes of true comedy, especially when Affleck looks at himself in the mirror, admiring his own muscles. It's clear that this scene, the meeting with Gigli's mother or some lines are truly funny and work more or less. Some of the bad press this movie received was due to his main couple media overkill. Some people were bored to death with the two leading actors. But Jennifer Lopez had even more ill-matched roles. She was a psychiatrist dressed as Virgin Mary, she was a maid cleaning up the bathrooms, she was an abused spouse. And these movies were hits anyway. Affleck, as a lead actor, has never got much charisma or good charm. He was the star of a few movies (Daredevil, Pearl Harbor, The Sum of all Fears) because there's no other actor in his generation that would fit the good guy character. But he's still bland. \"Gigli\" was one movie too much for either of them... So for the two of them...But the main thing is that the movie is flawed from the beginning. It could not have been a good movie but with a few changes it would have certainly been a bearable movie.1) The cast. The use of \"glamorous\" actors is utter stupidity. If there was any play with their public image, it could have been better but it's hard to picture two celebrities as mediocre people, no-names without any redeeming quality. Why is good-looking Gigli a truant rather than a model or an actor? And the dream of the  kidnapped brother is to go to \"Baywatch\". Well, dude, you've got JENNIFER LOPEZ in front of you and you only think of Pamela Anderson? No wonder they put you in an hospital.2) The acting. Jennifer Lopez, with her high-toned voice isn't convincing for a second. She just chews her lines and has from time to time a tongue-in-cheek smile to show the audience she's the smarter one. Ben Affleck is marginally better. He could be almost convincing as a dumb loser. But the biggest disappointment lies with the cameos of both Walken and Pacino. I've never seen them overacting so much. They make Robert DeNiro in \"We're No Angels\" or \"The Untouchables\" look like a model of understatement. I guess they must have received some good money because they show all their acting tricks during their scene. Pacino is particularly hammy and Christopher Walken doesn't bring anything to the movie.3) The story line. Poor, poor, poor. Brest desperately tries to be original and he ends up with a gross and meaningless study of men-women relationships. In many movies you can have some plot holes. The audience will be indulgent or the holes will bring an eerie climate. In \"Gigli\", you can't help noticing these plot holes. Why is Gigli's boss stupid enough to ask Gigli to take care of this dangerous mission? What happens to the lesbian lover? It has simply no coherence.4) The tone. Twenty minutes could have been cut and nobody would complain.I guess the director tried to make a loose and free-minded satirical comedy about relationships between men and women. His script could have given at best a mediocre independent movie. It could only get worse when it was turned into a blockbuster. Instead of subtlety, you only perceive vulgarity. It was a no-win situation.The only really sad thing about \"Gigli\" is not that it makes you waste two hours. It is that studios will be even more reluctant to give the green light to anything a little original.",

            "content": "I just had to see this film even after the avalanche of the worst revues this side of \"Freddie Got Fingered\". Story is about a small time hood named Larry Gigli (Ben Affleck) who works for Louis (Lenny Venito), a mob guy in Los Angeles and he tells Larry to kidnap a young man named Brian (Justin Bartha) who has that \"Rain Man\" condition and he does and takes him back to his apartment. Later, there is a knock on his door and its Ricki (Jennifer Lopez) who doesn't give her correct name and says that Louis sent her over to help out with watching Brian and make sure Larry doesn't screw things up. The two of them share his bed but Ricki tells him to forget any romantic thoughts because she's a lesbian. He's very attracted to her and one day Ricki's lover barges in to his apartment and thinks they are sleeping together. She cuts her wrists and they take her to the hospital. While there, they go down to where they store bodies and get a thumb off a corpse because they are suppose to cut off one of Brian's thumbs but they kind of like him. One morning Louis calls and they are to meet this other mob guy (Al Pacino) from New York. At his place the guy shoots Louis because the wrong thumb was sent! This film was directed and written by Martin Brest who usually presents films about mis-matched pairs like \"Scent of a Woman\" and \"Midnight Run\" and \"Beverly Hills Cop\" and here he tries the same thing. Well, its a total failure and it fails on so many levels. While I agree that Affleck and Lopez do not have much chemistry, I believed that Affleck's character would be attracted to her even on a simple sexual infatuation. Lopez spends the entire film in the skimpiest outfits and one more centimeter lower and Lopez's ass crack would have been shown. If she's not wearing skimpy outfits then she's doing yoga and showing off her great body. Lopez doesn't really act here, she just poses. I know some like to badmouth Affleck's acting talent but I'm not one of those. I do think he is a good actor and at times he showed glimpses of his talent but its to no avail because they both have to recite the most inane dialogue in movie history \"Gobble Gobble\" and not at a moments time does it come across as believable. I've never really liked hitmen films and I thought \"Grosse Point Blank\" was a waste of time. The only one I liked was \"Prizzi's Honor\". Bartha as Brian is just an annoying plot device and only in bad films does a person with a condition like his look that good. Christopher Walken shows up and tries what appears to be some improvisation but his whole scene seems forced like Brest was forced to write a scene for him. Lopez is not only unbelievable as a mobster but she's unconvincing as a lesbian as well. The ending at the beach goes on and on! You keep waiting for it to end and the scene goes on for at least 10 or 15 more minutes! What happened? Did the editor of the film fall asleep? The pacing of the film is ponderous and the actors do what I like to call \"Clunk Around\" like a broken piece of something caught in a machines gears. Even the music was bad, it sounded like that background music you hear in all mob or heist films. Martin Brest is a respectable director but you have to seriously wonder what he was thinking.",

            "content": "I believe this was supposed to be a tongue in cheek subtle mob comedy/drama, but unfortunately the plot moves too slowly to hold much interest. There are a few comedic parts but they are too few. It comedic style is subtle dark humour and situational.Had the director sped it up an element of farce could have emerged, but I believe it was slowed for dramatic effect or in some parts to create a more heartening experience. Which is fine with comedies involving complex plot lines or wit, but for a film such as this, it made it tedious to sit through, especially since it is a long flick.The script needed revising, and editing could have removed a large chunk of the film and it would have improved a lot. Some scenes really didn't need to be in the film as they didn't add to the story. J-Lo does ok, but unfortunately Ben's performance as a semi-brained mobster was not convincing. The Leisure Suite Larry background music and blank silences added to what people would consider a bad film and is probably one of the reasons it was reviewed so lowly by so many people. Most Hollywood films have a run of the gun style production, faster, more action and bigger is better. I think the intension of this film was the opposite and tries to give a more 'real' feel to the film, different to the normal tripe the leads are usually cast in. Again, it doesn't really work in Gigli, but the style doesn't always make a bad film. Gigli is watchable its just unlikely to be on anyone's best film list.",

            "content": "I don't understand why everyone seems to think this is one of the worst movies ever made. Of course, I also enjoyed \"Ishtar.\" Could it possibly be that this couple will probably never get together? Lots of movie couples have a major obstacle that stands in the way of a genuine romance. But this is not an impossible situation here. And look at several mismatched TV couples (though on TV, we had years to anticipate the inevitable; here, just two hours minus commercials): Dave and Maddie on \"Moonlighting\", Joel and Maggie on \"Northern Exposure\", Lois and Clark in \"Lois and Clark\". In two of those three cases, we were actually better off without the couple being a \"couple.\" Here, I like the brother-sister dynamic with a hint of sexual tension.Jennifer Lopez is a big reason why I liked this movie. Right from her first scene, her character is so nice, slightly flirty, and tough. Her standout scene is in a restaurant where several disagreeable young men are playing loud music. And toward the end of the movie, Lopez had me completely convinced that an unexpected plot twist came as a complete surprise. She appeared genuinely shocked (as if the script was changed without her being told), and her character seemed shaken up but still handled herself well.But never mind her talent. Look at her! Great hair, great smile, great legs. And in her first scene she has on a low-cut top that shows off her tummy. But get ready--halfway through the movie J-Lo is doing yoga wearing almost nothing. And in the next scene she is in the shower, shown from the back from the waist up, at least on TV. Another incentive for straight guys to watch: one of the final scenes has dozen of babes in bikinis!I'm not sure why I think of Ben Affleck as a respected actor. It's probably because of his association with Matt Damon, who has unquestioned talent. But Damon isn't here. And I've also heard Affleck is considered a bad or mediocre actor. There's nothing here to support either position. He's not great, but not bad.Justin Bartha as Brian reminds me a lot of Dustin Hoffman in \"Rain Man.\" There's surely more dimension to Hoffman's Oscar-winning performance, but on the surface, Bartha appears to do a good job. In many of the scenes where he is wearing a colorful golf shirt (great shirt, by the way; where can I get one?) he lacks the ability to focus his eyes, which may be a symptom of his particular disability. On the other hand, his focus seems fine when he is wearing a t-shirt, and his ability to speak seems almost normal. I didn't even recognize him. There are a couple of scenes where his gibberish is completely unintelligible, but that may actually be accurate for this disability. A pretty good job overall; I found myself caring about this character.Al Pacino also does a good job as the evil boss. He's really worth seeing.As for Louis: well, he's just plain mean. Lenny Venito is okay, but I certainly don't find myself rooting for him.It's a nice little film if you get to see it edited for TV.",

I actually saw two higher profile movies last summer that were worse yet they somehow avoided this kind of backlash.  The bottom line problem is that Affleck and Lopez are too famous to hide into characters. We see this ubiquitous pair as Bennifer and it's hard to accept them as anything else. The second problem deals with some of the plot devices such as the implausibility that Lopez' character, who is presumably a hardnosed hitwoman, would suddenly change her sexuality for an inferior hitman.  At first, I also found the movie to be hard to follow. What keeps this from being the worst movie I have ever seen are the cameos from Walken, Pacino, Missy Crider, and Lainie Kazan.  I also thought that Justin Bartha's performance allowed this movie to have a heart.  Lopez and Affleck's performances were not bad (Lopez giving the better performance of the two) but it's just you can no longer see beyond their public personas. Lopez is actually a good actress who had a lot of promise before she became J-Lo but now she is too famous. The movie was simply okay, not great, not good, not worst I have ever seen, but okay.",

It certainly isn't a masterpiece, however it is better many of the mind-numbing movies being made these past few years (see last paragraph). It has received mostly \"1\" votes simply because it became fashionable to \"follow the leader\", to jump on the bandwagon of those saying it was a terrible movie. The main thing I wished was Christopher Walken and Al Pacino had switched roles. Pacino is his absolute worse here, and Walken could have given that character some subtlety and dimension. But the biggest issue I have is that most viewers missed the point of the movie all together.The story is about the mentally-challenged Brian, and his journey from the institution into a more fulfilling life. Granted, it was quite a strange path he took, nevertheless Gigli (Affleck) and all the other hoods are there only to facilitate his journey, in a comedic manner. This is a story of redemption, of Brian.SPOILERS FOLLOW, read further only if you have seen the movie. Brian has a wealthy and powerful brother, a prosecutor. A NY thug (Pacino) is in legal trouble so a local LA thug gets Gigli to 'escort' (kind way of saying 'kidnap') the mentally-challenged Brian out of the institution, promising to take him to see the 'baywatch.' But Brian is being held for leverage. J-Lo's character makes it a three-some, she is smart and hired to 'watch' dumb Gigli, to make sure he doesn't screw things up. Gigli gets romantically interested in her, but she tells him she is a lesbian. The infamous 'gobble, gobble' scene is in somewhat poor taste, but for an R-rated, adult-themed movie, not any worse that many I've seen in other movies. In the end they outsmart the NY thug, and as they are taking Brian back to the institution come across what appears to be 'Baywatch', or a very similar show, being filmed on the beach. So they stop, call Brain's brother so he can be found, and Brian falls in with the group of extras and gets paired up with a very cute blond in a bikini, from Australia, his favorite accent. So, Brain may go back to the institution, after all he can hardly take care of himself, but his life has been changed by this experience. And, J-Lo and Affleck will head out of LA, to start a new, simpler life. Maybe...Just a few recent movies that are not even as good as 'Gigli' -- Bad Santa (2003), Black and White (1999), Bring It On (2000), Just Married (2003), Me, Myself, & Irene (2000), Very Bad Things (1998), and Whipped (2000) -- just to name a few.

It's not because they're bad actors or anything, something else stopped the relationship from blooming. Every single time this movie tried to have a sweet moment between the two, they played it for laughs. I have seen straight comedies do a better job of being romantic than this. The gangster part doesn't make sense, I don't want to spoil anything, but there is a very easy way for this movie to just end very early on. Speaking of which, why was this movie two hours long? It didn't need to be. And there are a bunch of character's that have no purpose and just flat out disappear: Christopher Walken, J-Lo's lesbian girlfriend, the mob boss. As well as several character traits, such as Gigli being a screw up. Also, is this film saying that lesbians can be actracted to gay men and vice versa? I will give it this though, it can be funny at times. Justin Bartha can get some laughs, although half the time he speaks so fast I couldn't understand what he was saying. But I did laugh I descent amount of times I guess. And some of the dialogue was interesting, you know, when they weren't talking about genitals to try and make character development.Gigli fails as a romance, and it fails as a gangster flick.

Walken's appearance could have been a lot more menacing if he had been allowed to do something psychopathic and unpredictable but he was almost like \"I'll do the standard Walken thing, a few veiled threats and exit stage left.\" Pacino surprised me when he shot the guy through the head for no real reason other than he didn't want to go to prison, the actor had to sit there through the rest of the scene with his mouth open impersonating a chap shot through the forehead.One review did notice the rainman impersonation. Jolie drives off into the sunset twice the last time with the guy at the end who seems to be allowed to escape to wherever he wants to almost with Pacino's approval.It's also possible that the actors thought it was going nowhere so just played things out to collect the dollars as it would have been too embarrassing to just cancel the film and destroy all the evidence of it ever having taken place.",

Well, it is REALLY bad. At times, it is entertainingly bad - my friends and I couldn't stop watching it because we couldn't believe how awful it got with each and every scene. Martin Brest, who wrote and directed the classic Midnight Run, totally stumbles here with a stupid, clich\u00e9d script and almost every single role is miscast. From the get-go you do not believe for a minute that Lopez and Affleck are gangsters of any kind - nor do you believe that they have ever harmed or threatened anyone ever. Even the opening scene where Affleck (Gigli) has a guy tied up in an industrial sized dryer - the whole attempt at quirky Elmore Leonard type crime humor falls flat - that's another problem - the film never gets it's tone right - it tries to be Get Shorty but at other times wants to be Rain Man emotional - it's like throwing ingredients into a pasta dish and just hoping people will eat it - well, no thanks - nothing but acid reflux here!Affleck is truly terrible (which is a shame - because he is talented - he's good in Dazed & Confused, Good Will Hunting and does strong work in the recent HollywoodLand). He and Lopez have no chemistry even though they were a \"couple\" at the time. Pacino shows up - obviously doing a favor for Brest who directed him in Scent Of A Woman. The movie has one of the false wrap-ups where none of the characters have earned any of the supposed wisdom they've acquired - they change just because the script says so - not through any natural progression. Having the mentally handicapped guy try and rap is the movie's idea of funny. Hoo boy. What a train wreck.",

I thought to myself. \"Eh, this has Al Pacino in it, why not give it a try?\" When I was done with the film, I was a different person. This movie has bolstered me and made me a more mature and sensible person. This film is a true work of art, and a model for all things cinematography.First off, the acting was simply a perfection. I had to keep reminding myself that I was indeed just watching a fictional movie, and this was not a real-life experience. Affleck's and Lopez's impersonations of their characters were absolutely incredible. It seemed as if they did not just assume the roles of their characters, but if they had taken on their souls and hearts and came out in the bodies of actors. Affleck's performance in particular struck me as unforgettably real, and I , once again, I had to keep telling myself that Ben was just an actor, and not a real-life street thug.JLo's impersonation of Ricki, a sweet-voiced lesbian gangster, is quite simply out of this world. I was literally knocked off my feet during the Oscars, when she did not win the Best Actress. I kept crying and beating my head against the bathtub, so deep was my offense with the public's judgment of this extraordinary actress. The plot is simply brilliant. This movie is a an action-packed drama,while at the same time being a romantic comedic thriller. As we move deeper into Affleck's deep, dark, mysterious personality, and find out more about his unbelievable past, we learn to love this seemingly crude thug, as we realize what a lovable, smart, down-to-earth, courageous, and decisive gentleman he really is. As for Jennifer Lopez, we are first shocked by her independence, her incredible ability to compromise (\"Let's try to make this nice\"), and her sexual manipulation of men.The audience is driven to tears as we learn Ricki's insecurities, as she does not want Gigli to learn her real name . These fears are so unbelievably real that virtually anyone on Earth can relate to them.The relationship of Ben Affleck and Justin Bartha eerily mirrors that of Tom Cruise and Dustin Hoffman in \"Rain Man\". The parallel of a tough, protective older figure and the feeble-minded genius is so real, I kept telling myself that this was indeed a different movie. Also, Ben Affleck portrayal of a city's gangster is virtually identical to that of Al Pacino in the \"Scarface\". A true, baller, hustler, gangster, a killer who has no regard for the cost of human life, a man who does not fear anything, a man who is indifferent to pain or pleasure , a hit-man who can meet with Triumph and Disaster and treat those two impostors just the same, and so hold on, when there is nothing in him, except the will which says to him , \"Hold on!\", Ben Affleck is cruel, merciless, ambitious, and undeniable street thug, the ultimate gangster.Overall, this film took cinematography to the next level. \"Godfather\", \"Casablanca\", and \"Goodfellas\", \"Scarface\", and \"Citizen Kane\", make some room-Gigli is here to stay.",

She's a lesbian and Gigli is frustrated. Police Det. Stanley Jacobellis (Christopher Walken) investigates Gigli for the kidnapping.I don't see where the comedy is supposed to be coming from. The plot drags along slowly. It's terribly long. A bad movie can make time stand still. Gigli is such an unlikable character, Riki is stiff, and they have no chemistry together. His treatment of Brian is cringe-worthy and Brian is no treat either. The three lead characters sound like a bad joke; a meat-head, a lesbian, and a retard. I feel like this movie is begging for somebody like Tarantino to make the dialog sing. I don't think Martin Brest is capable of doing the writing that is required. Walken tries his best but the words lack the fun and power. There isn't one single smile-worthy humorous moment in the whole movie.",

Basically in Los Angeles, Larry Gigli (Razzie winning and nominated Ben Affleck) is a low ranking mobster who acts tough but is nowhere the exterior he portrays, and his latest job is to kidnap the younger brother of a powerful federal prosecutor, mentally challenged Brian (The Hangover's Justin Bartha), to save New York mob boss Starkman (Razzie nominated Al Pacino) from going to prison. Gigli convinces Brian to go with him, to take him \"to the Baywatch\", this seems to be the young man's singular obsession, Louis (Lenny Venito) who ordered the kidnapping does not trust Gigli to get the job done right, so taking charge of the situation and keeping an eye on him is a woman calling herself Ricki (Razzie winning and nominated Jennifer Lopez). Gigli is becoming frustrated that Louis has no faith in him and is forcing him to take orders from a woman, that Brian keeps insisting on going \"to the Baywatch\" and calling the phone number for weather reports, and that he is attracted to Ricki but she is a lesbian, she even explains why she loves the vagina and female anatomy more than the male. During the time they spend together the kidnappers are hankered with a visit from Detective Stanley Jacobellis (Razzie nominated Christopher Walken), and they are at one point forced to pay a visit to Gigli's overbearing Mother (Razzie nominated Lainie Kazan), and Brian, although keeping quiet most of the time, sings rap songs and talks about his longing to be with a beautiful woman. Then Gigli and Ricki receive orders that turn events dark, they must cut off Brian's thumb and send it to Louis, neither of them want to do this, and worse comes when Ricki's girlfriend Robin (Missy Crider) shows up accusing her of cheating, she also slits her wrists and must be taken to hospital, while there Gigli cuts off a thumb from a corpse in the morgue. Following this back at the apartment Gigli confesses his love for Ricki, and she confesses to having been developing some feelings for him, and finally the pair sleep together, but the following day they are called together by Louis to meet Starkman. The mob boss reveals that he did not actually want the mentally challenged young man to be kidnapped, and the thumb that was cut off did not match his fingerprints, he kills Louis in front of them, he is about to kill Gigli, but Ricki, who is a very good talker, persuades him to think twice, eventually he puts the gun down and allows them to leave. The pair decide it is time to take Brian back to where he belongs, on the journey however he spots a filmmaking crew shooting on the beach, similar to Baywatch, it turns out this is what he wanted, to go to a beach with beautiful women on it, they leave Brian happy there, Ricki initially leaves, but she drives back to pick up Gigli, and they leave town together. Affleck is not all that cool and charismatic, Lopez is gorgeous but with not a lot of substance, they may have been a couple in real life, but their on screen connection is only mildly believable, as for Walken and Pacino, they don't have all that much to do apart from give their predictable personas. I hardly laughed at all, I was appalled by the foul mouthed abuse aimed at the innocent disabled character, also unbelievably the butt of jokes, I was cringing with most of the ridiculous dialogue, especially Lopez opening her legs and saying \"It's turkey time. Gobble, gobble.\", the love story is silly, and the crime element is underused, I agree this is worth seeing just to see how bad it is, a terrible romantic crime comedy. It won the Razzies for Worst Picture, Worst Screen Couple and Worst Screenplay for Martin Brest, Worst 'Comedy' of Our First 25 Years, and it was nominated for Worst Picture of the Decade.

Wow, why would anyone make such a thing? Ben Affleck is clearly wrong for the part of the italiano style thug, he's neither italiano nor a thug, and he's the main character. But it gets better, director Martin Brest decided to write in J-LO as a lesbian who can be converted to heterosexuality by said non-thug in a matter of days. Now, she is supposed to be some kind of hard, stone cold femme fatale but she fails at being anything like that. I would much rather have watched Melissa Lahlitah Crider, who shows up briefly as J-Lo's girlfriend, in the role. The film does have a saving grace though, in the form of Al Pacino's cameo. That being said, Gigli is not really a bad film, extremely ridiculous but not bad; more sort of mediocre, well at the low end of mediocre but still, one notch above bad.",

What hold does director Martin Brest have over Al Pacino that persuaded him, after the ghastly \"Scent of a Woman\" to do an imitation Ben Kingsley (as in Sexy Beast) in this floperoo? And why was anyone persuaded that the script, by Brest, was worth making in the first place? Devoid of wit, characterisation, plot, or anything to look at, the film is a succession of telephone calls, entrances and exits, and shots of people thinking. the editor could have lost 40 minutes of the final running time, and only made the film ten times better.Better yet would if it had never been made at all.",

Giving it 5/10 does not mean I liked it, it means the good and the bad canceled each other out.There are many reasons to like this movie. There is some witty dialog, despite what the overwhelming majority say, and Ben Affleck minus some of his horrid flirting scenes is completely serviceable in this film. I think it was lost on some people that this is a comedy, and much of the comedy in this movie is derived from watching Ben Affleck's character be put in awkward and strange situations. The most obvious example of this is the morgue scene where he needs to get a finger, and only has a cheap plastic knife at his disposal, while also having to babysit a mentally ill hostage. Christopher Walken has a great wacky Walken scene in this movie that if you took in any way other than comedy, you did it wrong. I almost recommend the movie for the scene with Al Pacino alone. He may be playing a caricature of previous roles he has done, but he does it oh so well.Now, the bad. Yes, quite a bit of the dialog is drawn out and sub par, especially between Affleck and Lopez. There are several lines in the movie that I would say are worthy of being enshrined in the terrible dialog hall of shame. I would say that the mental illness humor probably wasn't as big of a hit as the script hopes for, because there is a lot of it. I would say that if the viewer cannot stand Ben Affleck, or does not like situational humor that Gigli finds himself in, this movie can turn into an unfunny comedy. And trust me, I understand that not much is worse than an unfunny comedy. Thankfully the humor in this movie worked enough for me that I got through the movie without hating it, and if it was 10 or 15 minutes shorter, I probably would have given it a 6. I wouldn't recommend the movie as a whole, but I would definitely recommend the Al Pacino scene by itself. If this is the worst movie you have ever seen, you haven't seen enough movies.",

            "content": "I remember the day in 2003 after this movie came out. My father and I were watching television early on a Saturday morning, and some sort of all-purpose newscast brought up \"Gigli,\" which had apparently imploded following one night of screening. When the film finally turned up on videocassette at a thrift store for fifty cents five years later, I decided I would take the plunge.I had a hard time telling what was funny because it was funny, and what was supposed to be dramatic and turned out funny because it was bad, and what was supposed to be funny but turned out bad because it was bad. The plot - following two \"contractors\" and the mentally retarded man they kidnap - takes place primarily indoors, with a healthy mix of driving scenes that seem to inexplicably seem to loop back to the same house each time. Christopher Walken and Al Pachino both appear for one scene each, then vanish - giving the film an Alice-in-Wonderland feel, as if the whole thing was written by somebody running a fever of 102.Maybe it was.What I will say for \"Gigli\" was that it is watchable. It's not something I'd pay more than fifty cents to see, but was watchable. This sets it apart from a lot of the other bad movies I've seen - or, for that matter, some of the allegedly good ones. The worst movie I ever saw was called \"Breaking the Waves.\" Yes, I know the rest of you liked it, but I didn't. Sometimes quality and watchability are at odds - and here, a bad movie was watchable. Despite the incredibly bad... everything, I never actually felt compelled to turn the TV off.In my opinion, this was a bad movie. A really, REALLY bad movie. But it never really crossed the line from \"awful\" to \"unbearable.\" So yeah, watch it if you get the chance. But don't tell anybody you did.",

But point people to something and tell them it's \"Baddddd\" and they'll move right along, \"Baddddd!\" (<--- Imagine sheep noise for full effect.) \"Yay! Something we get to pick on! Yay! Something we get to throw stones at!\" Case in point ... _Gigli_. I watched it recently, waiting for it to suck. \"It's supposed to suck,\" I said. \"When't it going to start sucking?\" Now, I'm not saying it's _Citizen Kane_ or anything, but it's far, far from being the laughable Crap Fest that everyone says it was. It seemed like a decent Romantic ... I don't quite know what genre to put it in. It's not a Romantic Comedy because it's not trying to be funny. It's kind of a softer _Out of Sight_ or a _Get Shorty_ with a more even pace that's not trying to be a hip satire. Maybe it's just me. Maybe I have no taste. But more likely people wanted to jump on the \"Dump on the Hollywood Couple That Everyone Loved to Hate\" Bandwagon.Look, _Gigli's_ not fabulous, but it's not bad. Get over yourselves. Oh, and to the guy who thought the yoga scene was overlong ... you may be right.

I watched this film to see exactly what was so horrible about it.Basically, the plot is useless, the acting is awful and is an unfortunate failure in many ways. The worst of them all, I think, are the painfully long dialogs that Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez deliver in a lot of scenes. Lopez is completely unconvincing as a lesbian gangster and Affleck tries, but unfortunately cannot convince anybody why he is what he is. It's certainly true what they say about the scene where Ricki's \"ex lover\" slits her wrists, useless as a car with no gas. I kept watching however, because Al Pacino's scene was coming up. His character shoots Gigli's boss dead, which makes him somewhat of a threat and a little scary. But unfortunately, as somehow predicted, what followed was disappointing: Lopez somehow manages to fix the situation in her mobster manner, which I repeat, is sadly not convincing, a fact which saves her and Gigli's lives. Would it have been better if Starkman(Pacino) killed them both? I don't know.All I know is this: I didn't watch the ending because it seemed so useless and I don't need to watch it again. We get to see Christopher Walken and Al Pacino in a \"movie\", that was the only highlight. It ruined everybody that worked on the movie's career and I felt sorry for them. Fortunately for the actors, Pacino especially, they were able to get more interesting works done after that. But alas, for Martin Brest, it put a stop to his career, hopefully not permanently.",

If you took the same plot with two different actors, I don't think you would have seen such an outcry of hate.The biggest problem is that Gigli is supposed to be a Bad Ass Tough Guy hitman, but we never see that from him. Even in the opening scene he is jokingly collecting from the laundromat guy. This makes it hard to buy into the fact that being around Brian has somehow caused a change in him. The same goes for Ricki/Rochelle. She is brought in we are told to be just as bad as Gigli, but again we never see it. It becomes more of a Chasing Amy plot with Brian playing the Banky role and the Bennifer duo playing hitmen instead of artists.Ben and Jennifer play their parts well, but Justin Bartha outshines them both in the role of Brian. The story has holes, but it also has a great guest appearance from Christopher Walken. Overall and average film that probably only got made because the leads are on the covers of the grocery aisle rags every week.Worth a rental, but I wouldn't buy it.....",

I can see why it had a bad reputation: silly dialog, tons of plot holes, goofy performances, and plenty of overdone sentiment augmented by a drippy soundtrack.That shouldn't be enough to give a movie the kind of reputation this one had, though. I think it had more to do with a backlash against Ben and Jen. As a story, it's definitely screwy, but most of its problems aren't anything you wouldn't find in numerous big budget hits.Basically, Ben Affleck's character kidnaps a mentally impaired man as part of an extortion job. Jennifer Lopez is another hit man assigned to the same job, forcing them to work together. They fall in love over the course of the job, and learn lessons of life and love from each other and the kidnappee.I found it entertaining enough to watch all the way through without fast forwarding, until the last few moments. Both leads had moments that they did well. Even though it's kind of silly to think of Ben Affleck as a tough guy killer, I liked the scenes where he would get angry and swear. Jennifer Lopez had some really cringe-worthy lines in which she had to give silly monologues. She would talk for a few minutes and use a lot of big words, and it was supposed to change the mind of whoever was listening to her. I guess her character was supposed to be persuasive. She did do a good job being seductive, but her role was supposed to be a contract killer. Nothing her character did established her as dangerous, except that we were told so.Put on top of that the orchestral swells that are instructing us to get misty-eyed when nothing emotional is happening, and you have a movie that just about exists in an alternate universe. The script never should have been approved, and the director should never have been assigned to this project. It was a real mismatch. But I'm still not sure I would have hated as much as the folks who bad mouthed it over the years.",

This is the second film that Affleck has done that has basically flop at the box office,a prime example was the action flick \"Daredevil\".

Yes, there were many flaws to the film. The terrible acting of Ben Afflecks role and how the script put him all over the place. He was supposed to be a hardened thug, but failed bringing that to the screen miserably. Then what, a softened man under it all? How about we just say he's an average loser who is constantly trying to defend his masculinity, but apparently has none. The Lesbian hopping the fence for this guy? Really? I'm not sure what is more appalling, that someone really thinks a true lesbian would easily swap genders so easily or that Ben afflicts character was soooo enticing that he could win over any gender? And the portrayal of a handicap kid. Wow. I know this is where they were trying to pull the heart strings, but I don't think it would have went over that smoothly from taking someone with such a disability out of their comfort zone and routine...There were some things about the movie that was appealing. I liked the dynamic that Jennifer Lopez portrayed with Ben Affleck. Her role was very masculine when it came to power dynamics. She was never equal with any man, but always above them. She didn't fear them, didn't need to be rescued, she held her ground and acted as though she was above them. It's rare to see those power dynamics in romance comedy, not only was she equal, with Affleck, but she was above him. Jennifer did a good job with her role. She was sexy, powerful, and very well spoken with witty lines. But with that said some might find that annoying, She always came across as putting Affleck down, instead of meeting him in the middle. One fatal flaw even with the power dynamics in reverse, Jennifer never came across as a violent person. She was playing the role of a hired thug, but not for one moment did I believe she would harm a soul.",

The specific ins and outs of the accounting maze are too complex to go into, but to guarantee a money-loser, the studio selected the most idiotic script available, threw huge sums of money to Hopkins and Pitt, (both known for phoning in their performances once the check clears), and turning the while mess over to Brest who needed no help in throwing kerosene on this blazing pile. And if you doubt the truth of this, I suggest you rent the DVD just to watch the hospital scene where Pitt speaks in a Jamaican patois while consoling an old lady who is near-death. Or the scene in which Hopkins muses over his late wife's way with a cold lamb sandwich. (Legend has it that several takes were required due to Hopkins' tendency to doze off during this speech.)There are at least another dozen eye-rolling scenes for the masochist.In other words, \"Gigli\" never stood a chance...",

Sitting through it was like being shipwrecked on a desert island with nothing to eat but expired tins of Spam.To be fair, Jennifer Lopez' speech about the superiority of her private parts (versus the male \"sea slug\" and/or \"big toe\" or whatever she calls it), delivered while she writhes face-up on the floor performing some sort of yoga tactic, was nearly watchable. And the guy who plays the mentally challenged dude steals every scene he's in. These are just minor points, though. We're also forced to sit through mind-bogglingly heavy-handed scenes, such as the one where J-Lo's psycho lesbian ex-lover shows up out of the blue and slits her wrists in a fit of deranged hysteria, and the one where Al Pacino (whose idea of acting these days seems to involve yelling his lines louder and louder to convey depth) shows up to rant and rave incoherently until J-Lo's equally meaningless soliloquy renders him - believe it or not - slack-jawed and speechless.

But the worst scene is when Lopez starts chatting on about her lesbian sh**...And Christopher Walken and Al Pacino enters in small roles, it just shows so clearly off that the old, method men do everything for the money these days! Though I've never really liked Affleck this just made me sort of hate him, and what's with the story??

I don't think I've ever witnessed the assassination of a movie before, and this proves that the professional critics really do have power.  Maybe I had the advantage of having no expectations whatsoever, but I thoroughly enjoyed watching this film.It's not a cinematic triumph, nobody's going to get an Oscar, though Al Pacino (as always) probably deserves one for chewing up the scenery.  I think people had two fundamental problems with the movie:  it wasn't an action movie (and everyone's on an action sugar-high after a dozen or so summer action films) and the female lead was a lesbian.  If this movie had been released in the fall or spring, and not hyped as a summer B.Af-J.Lo blockbuster, it probably would have been more favourably received.The movie has interesting--often clever--dialogue, an interesting turn-around in sexual dominance and an unexpected ending that put a smile on my face.  No cars were smashed, the death-count only reached one and the characters just sat around and talked.  So what?  For the most part what they talked about was intriguing.It's a shame, but bad things sometimes happen to perfectly good movies. Rent it when it comes out on video.",

Perhaps the plot doesn't make perfect sense, but many decent movies require the suspension of disbelief.

Yet after Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck rekindled their romance and the movie was included in my streaming service, I gave in.With the current iMDb score you'd expect a stelar level of incompetence, but Gigli turned out to be far from that. In fact, it proved how irrelevant iMDb score is.I agree the script is clumsy and overtly verbose. Yet back in the day there were other authors who offered the same with far less substance and received standing ovations. For example, Quentin Tarantino.The cast was solid. I mean, is anyone asserting there is even a statistical probability that Christopher Walken or Al Pacino may deliver a bad performance? This, in fact, makes Lainie Kazan and Missy Crider shine even brighter because I didn't expect anything from them.From what we've seen so far, Justin Bartha delivered a role of his life in Gigli. And there is an obvious chemistry between Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck.Gigli is a romantic comedy with elements of a crime thriller. Despite the questionable script, it has heartwarming moments, funny jokes and some suspense.Will I watch Gigli again? No. Will I recommend it? Probably not.

People left the theater last night and I should have been one of them.  I really don't see why I should tell you the plot line, but I will, since I saw the whole movie.  Larry Gigli (Ben Affleck) is a small-time hood in Los Angeles, who gets a mob assignment to kidnap Brian (Justin Bartha), the psychologically challenged younger brother of a federal prosecutor who is trying to send a New York mob boss, Starkman (Al Pacino) to prison.  Gigli's boss, Louis (Lenny Venito) doesn't trust Gigli with this important job, so he sends in reinforcements in the form of a beautiful lesbian assassin, Ricki (Jennifer Lopez).  Gigli tries to win the affections of Ricki until he finds out that she is a lesbian. The movie goes downhill from there, especially, with all the vulgar language.  The only good scene in the movie was when Starkman flies to LA to take care of business with some payback.  Too bad he didn't also take care of the writers.  0/10",

Personally, I like the guy.A lot of people will slam this movie because they think it doesn't make since. Like \"If Jennifer Lopez is a lesbian, then why does she sleep with Ben Affleck?\" or \"Why is there a scene where she simply discusses the pros and cons of vaginas and penises\". A lot of people will think these scenes or plot points to be pointless, when in fact, without them, the movie would be kinda bad. These two examples (which I've heard more than one person bitch about), are very important.The vagina discussion helps to build Jennifer Lopez's character, as well as help develop Ben Affleck's character. Sure, it's not in your face character development, you just have to watch closely.Shortly before Lopez and Affleck have sex, what happens? First, Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez form a bit a bond, followed by (in a very Chasing Amy like moment) Affleck admitting he likes her. Now, the way I saw it anyway, is that the bond they'd formed (though a bit of a bumpy bond) made Jennifer Lopez see him in a different light as opposed to all of the men she knew. And, keep in mind faithful readers, she had been with men in the past (i.e. Gigli's mom saying to her \"You've been with men before though..\" or something close to that). Now, right before they have sex, what does she ask Affleck to do? She asks him to check his nails. He does, and he does it in a feminine way (sadly, I also checked my nails in a feminine way). Now, her bond with him, along with his feminine traits, made her more willing to give him a throw. I hope the sex scene makes more sense now.Ultimately, you'll have to decide whether you like this movie or not. I can't make that decision for you. But all I ask is that you watch the movie closely (don't take phone calls, leave the room or talk during the movie). Believe it or not, some movies you do need to pay attention to (which really, you should be paying attention anyway).Remember this bit: Pacino is in this movie. Pacino has a habit of making good movies. Also: Roger Ebert liked this movie. He has a habit of liking good movies.If you give the film a chance and still hate it, well, not every movie is for every person, but try not to go into this movie with any biases or set opinions of how you think it'll be.",

If it was a total bomb, I wouldn't have laughed once. It was where Lopez's ex-girlfriend forces herself into Gigli's apartment and threatens him with a kick to the skull that would cave it in, to which J. Lo responds with a sincere, yes, she really can do all that stuff. I don't know if that made any sense to you but I actually found it hilarious. The rest of the movie however, is absolutely horrible. It's not even funny bad, it's just sad bad. The best way I can sum up this movie is like this: imagine someone telling you a joke that goes on and on and on, with none of the details leading up to the punchline being funny (well, in this particular joke, it'd be that one moment I mentioned above), all just for there to be no punchline whatsoever. If you can imagine how frustrating that is or if you've already experienced something similar, then you know what watching Gigli is like.\nWatching it (which was purely out of morbid curiosity, I assure you), I couldn't figure out exactly what kind of movie I was watching. Was it a violent mob movie? Was it a comedy? Was it a love story? Was it an unsuccessful mix of all three? I don't know what the hell it was, honestly. The movie has these tender, cringe inducing moments that is cued to syrupy music, enough to make you gag with nausea. But then you'll get a scene where someone literally comes out of nowhere and slashes their wrists with a carving knife. Throw in a rap-slinging retarded kid with whom the main characters get inexplicably attached to and you have... well, what exactly?\nThis movie is just... there's just too much to trash here. I haven't even mentioned the cameos by Christopher Walken and Al Pacino. Anybody remember the last time Walken wasn't able to steal his scenes in whatever movie he did? Here's the movie for you. As for Al Pacino, I think he agreed to do this movie only because he would get to overact in it. His performance is absolutely horrible. I want the return of the quiet, brooding Pacino instead of this yelling maniac who thinks he's turning in something of artistic value. I'd like to see him do something these days where I don't need to be reminded that the person playing the part is indeed Al Pacino. Ben Affleck is never quite convincing as a tough guy and I'm sorry to say it but he comes off as a big softee. I have to give him credit for playing a punk who actually moos to his newfound lady in order to specify what his position is in their new relationship. Jennifer Lopez looks damn good but even her foxy self can't save this from flying into the mountains. Her character left me wondering exactly why she was put into the movie in the first place.This movie sucks and while I think it was viewed mainly as ammo against the real life Ben and Jen union (at the time of this writing, they have officially broken up), I think it should be viewed for what it is: a really bad movie. I think we need to leave those two alone for awhile.RATING: 0* out of *****.",

But with Gigli,they got it right. This is a truly embarrassing picture with a script so atrocious that I can't understand how it was decided \"Ooo this'll make a good film.lets make it!\".Supposedly this is a comedy,but the only laughs come from how bad it is. The basic setup-a hit-man kidnaps a mentally disabled boy and falls for a lesbian hitwoman sent to help him,is not quite the worst ever,but still a pathetic excuse for a movie. The central Ben and Jen relationship is woefully unconvincing and lacking in chemistry. One lengthy scene inwhich they discuss the merits of straight versus lesbian relationships had to be one of worst dialogue scenes ever written,climaxing in Lopez giving in to him {of course it only takes someone like Affleck and,hey,she's going to become straight}and saying \"gobble gobble,it's turkey time\". The mentally disabled boy just exists to be laughed at-films do not have to be politically correct but it's pathetic how almost all of the film's supposed intentional laughs are aimed at him. Every now and again a 'dramatic' bit is thrown in-a shooting,a wrist-slitting,and Christopher Walken and Al Pacino both turn up for a scene each,spout some muddled lines for about five minutes,and leave. unfortunately the gangster element never really feels like a part of the film,mind you,nothing hangs together,including a Baywatch subplot which becomes excruciating ten minutes in and gives the film it's 'climax'.Almost every dialogue scene takes three times longer than it need to be to get the relevant information across,an irritating fault that virtually destroyed Martin Brest's previous film Meet Joe Black,and yet here some scenes that would make the plot clearer actually seem to be missing. The phtotgraphy is ugly,the music score pathetic,and Affleck gives his worst performance yet {yes,it's that ba}],pulling odd facial expressions rather than actually acting. Lopez is not too bad,but she has always been a reasonably good actress,check out Out Of Sight and Enough.This is a disaster on every level,but it also has to be seen to be believed.",

Like when Gigli is explaining how he is crushed that he can't have Rikki, When Rikki and Gigli discuss the statistics of pleasure, the scenes of how people check their nails. It was also interesting to see Pacino in action about his great, \"thumb/ digit\" dialogue build up to his discovery of Gigli's failure to trick him.If \"Gigli\" was released as a lower budget, straight to Video film then I think that it wouldn't be as hated as it is. But make no mistake, it is still an embarassing disaster. but if you have nothing better to do, wipe the dust off of this one in the video store in a couple years, and give it a try. it's bad, but still watchable. */****",

I saw the film for myself, and to tell you the truth, it wasn't that bad. But it was bad. It's hard to understand. Let me break it down for you. The way Gigli was received, you would think it's...hmm....Jason X bad. It's not that bad but it just isn't a good film.First off, Ben Affleck's Italian or Brooklyn accent is bad. Jennifer Lopez's 20 minute speech (just exaggerating) about the vagina, was also bad. And to top it off, the annoying mentally retarded guy rapping to Baby's Got Back was the all time worst. This film was just a total let down to the Bennifer fans out there (not including me).The film just didn't work for me. There are a lot of films that I'd say are worst.

It is all the extra crap that they throw into it that makes it a very boring and sucky film to enjoy. There is lots of pointless dialogue that has nothing to do with anything. Most of it comes from J. Lo's mouth, so I guess they gave the dialogue to the right person. It's a shame the Christopher Walkin got to spew out some of that terrible dialogue as well. I'm a big fan of his, but I have to say that his role in this movie served no real purpose at all.Ben Affleck is a good actor and I am a fan of many of his films. I just don't think that he is a very good character actor. His New Yorker accent (or whatever the hell he's supposed to be) seems forced. He had some pretty decent lines in the film though.Al Pacino was the man. His role was the best one in this film. At least his role served a real purpose. SPOILER!!!I found myself glad when he shot Gigli's boss. I'm surprised nobody else had shot that character earlier in the film. He was completely obnoxious and the actor who played the character sucked at playing it.So there you have it. That's what I think of the movie. Martin Breast is a lousey screenwriter, but then again I couldn't do any better. I guess there's hope for me if I ever decide to write a screenplay.",

Its certainly not the best flick ever (no Chasing Amy) but it isn't the worst either. Sure, the writing seems half-assed but I didn't think that Jen and Ben performed poorly. I DO think that the \"Gobble, gobble\" line was the absolute worst line in the history of movies and I laughed but not because it was funny; I laughed because someone thought that that line WOULD have been funny and unfortunately, it was just tragic. Nevertheless, I tell anyone who will listen that I have seen the movie and even OWN the DVD and (after they stop giggling), I offer it up for them to watch so that they can come to their own conclusion, which I'm guessing many people have NOT done.

The film revolves around Affleck as a gangster who has to kidnap a mentally challenged man (played by Justin Bartha), then J-Lo helps him out and the catch is that she's a lesbian. Imagine Kevin Smith's decent movie \"Chasing Amy\" minus the enjoyment, while adding a crime plot and pretentiousness and you have \"Gigli\".Apparently, this flop of a movie costs around $75.5 million dollars.

The public was so sick of hearing about the Affleck/Lopez relationship by release time(justifiably so) that as soon as the bad reviews started to pour in from critical sources, most people were quick to call in the worst film ever before even seeing it.The rub here is that \"Gigli\" isn't the worst film ever -- it's merely really bad. A really bad movie isn't inept enough to be unintentionally hilarious for the ironic viewer. It takes a truly horrible movie to become a great comedy, while Gigli is just bad enough to be boring without becoming funny. As a result I was disappointed, as I'm sure many others who expecting this to be an unintentional comedy masterpiece were.Most disappointing - and unfair, in my opinion - were the performances of Affleck and Lopez, which were wooden and dull but certainly not the complete train wreck I was led to expect. Also, to blame them for making this awful movie is just asinine on the part of the viewing public. The pair of leads are *not* the reason \"Gigli\" sucks. It sucks for the reasons every other bad movie sucks: bad writing and awful direction. The screenplay is a forced, hackneyed attempt at emulating the hip crime films of the '90s(of the \"Pulp Fiction\" variety). The direction and editing is even worse; just about every scene is unmemorable, drab, uninspired, and proceeds at an excruciatingly slow pace. Martin Brest is both director and screenwriter, and he is the one who should have been lambasted endlessly by critics.

Sure Christopher Walken and Al Pacino excellent thesbians, but being like Louis (Lenny Ventino) seem to have no place in the film, especially as an intimidating (maybe sleazy) gangster.  Aside from that is the obvious, Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck as contract 'thugs', er... very ...bizarre.\nOn to the films high points.  'Jen and Ben' carry together an undeniable form of chemistry, and watching the two of them (no matter how sick we are of hearing about their beautiful relationship) brings a good feeling to everyone.

J-Lo's character seems to me to be a Bi-sexual, that was established in the scene with Gigli's mother. Also, I think the whole yoga scene will become a classic because J-Lo's speech on her character's perception of the power women have in a sexual relationship was right on. Was the end-scenes a little sappy - Yes, but I think it did relieve the tensions of the rest of the story and placed the film in the Black Comedy category. As we all know Black Comedies are very hard to do right. Christopher Walkin and Al Pacino's cameos are a little distracting because they are so well known and powerful actors.",

The pity of this film was never that Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez were involved (well... o.k., maybe Affleck). The pity was really the very poor scripting and generally bad creative decision making. To spell it out simply: Ben Affleck is the mob thug who never actually kills or hurts but perhaps one person.  That person is the stereotypically Rain Man-esque `sweetly retarded man' stereotype played almost well enough by Justin Bartha. Bravo. To add to the stupidity, J-Lo is the `lesbian assassin' who likewise never hurts or kills anyone, or kisses or makes love to a woman.  She does, however, read fashionably Eastern philosophy books, and can talk her way out of any fight, which explains why mob thugs bring her in to do the job Gigli (Affleck) cannot.  This, ladies and gentlemen, is a film dumber than any bag of hammers.  Don't know if it's the worst ever, but, to paraphrase Kevin Murphy, this kind of pain can't ever be good.",

I will briefly review why: One of the biggest wastes of money in Hollywood history (US$54M), that turned, in exchange, into one of the biggest bombs ever (no more than 2 weeks in theaters, an approximate gross of US$4-5M).It was, from the word 'go', a mere excuse to promote the blossoming romance between Ben and Jen at the time; only that the result was even more disastrous. You all remember why.Although the plot was no monument to originality, it had the potential to give room for an actually interesting -and even funny-love story; it's just that someone decided the opposite along the way.The dialog,... oh boy! A couple of lines from the movie come to my mind, and I feel just like I had a full blender-sized glass of Phillips' Magnesium Milk!! It's THAT disgusting.And, of course, the performances,... no, no. Correction!! The actors' WANDERING AND SLEEP-WALKING through every single scene. It was like they felt, from the beginning, it was all a colossal mistake, but, for the sake of the paycheck, decided to go along with the farce. Even Pacino and Walken, two eminences from American cinema, look like something worst than caricatures of themselves. Particularly Pacino worst than Walken; his cameo, instead of being a booster to the film, becomes as unneeded, untimely and loathsome as the most.Well, I guess that just about describes the experience. If you haven't seen it, you're not being spared of ANYTHING. If you did,... my condolences. If you are ACTUALLY PLANNING TO SEE IT,... do it at your own risk.",

Character and plot development are two things that you cannot live without...and honestly the only person who had real character development was the mentally challenged Brian played by Justin Bartha. J-Lo's character talked a lot but didn't actually do anything to make her seem dangerous, and the same goes for Ben Affleck's character with that terrible accent. Not to mention he couldn't even cut off a finger from a dead guy...also note he didn't actually carry a proper knife to do it right instead having to settle for a plastic butter knife which would definitely NOT do the trick. But we are supposed to believe they are gangsters. I could track on what was going on with the plot of kidnapping the kid to blackmail the DA or whatever, but there was no resolution nor were there other characters coming in to support the storyline other than Al Pacino's random gangster character that came in later to shoot a minor character because they messed up the thumb thing to get him out of whatever rap he was facing, and even he still did not seem like a threat to Bennifer since they talked themselves out of that too.To top it all off the ending just didn't make sense with the aforementioned Al Pacino role, which I would have thought would galvanize the characters to do something when all they end up doing is leaving the poor kid at a Baywatch shoot and driving off into the sunset together. But oh wait, J-Lo is supposed to be a lesbian. Though a poor one apparently due to the aforementioned sunset driving and of course the exception she makes for Affleck's character which is also unbelievable as she spends all this time talking about being a lesbian and saying things to prove her intelligence and Affleck's character says and does nothing intriguing to make the \"hopping the fence\" worthwhile. Add to that a random cameo by an ex- girlfriend who tries to kill herself and they leave that chick at the hospital too...honestly I don't know why they just didn't have her play it straight because it would have been better than that sad attempt to make Jennifer's character seem \"edgy\". That being said, the only redeeming factor of this movie was the whole seductive yoga lesbian dialogue, which I did find to be quite refreshing from a feminist perspective...and I'm a straight female. But again, even that did not redeem this film. So I guess watch it if you have nothing better to do, but I wouldn't go out of your way because while it is one of those semi-light movies in feel; once you realize just how void of actual character and plot elements it is you will want your 2 hours of your life back. You can YouTube the lesbian yoga thing if you are curious.",

Therefore, he should have seen the similarities and also where this film fell waaaaaaay short. Shame on him. Possible spoilers below. Then again, how could I spoil this movie any worse than the people who made it???Lesse... Guy who considers himself to be a fairly macho, heterosexual man falls for lesbian. She tries to convince him that a relationship between them won't work but ends up in bed with him anyway. This is basically the plot of both movies. However, in Chasing Amy, the relationship did not work in the end because, duh, she's a lesbian and he can't handle her sexual past. In Gigli, the lesbian doesn't seem to have much of a sexul past, beyond the psycho girlfriend who barges in on them at one point only to attempt suicide, thereby interrupting what little flow the movie has for a few minutes while they take her to the hospital. I won't spoil the ending, but I will say that I was glad to finally get to it.I'm surprised that advocates for the mentally challenged didn't protest this movie based on that incredibly sex-obsessed Brian kid. (I think it was Brian - I don't want to watch this movie again just to find out) Yes, everybody gets urges, but that kid seemed to think of nothing else. Sheesh.Gigli's posing and posturing in the mirror before going to bed was embarrassing to watch. Ricki's explanation for why everyone wants to kiss people on the lips was just silly.I can't believe Al Pacino got involved in this train wreck of a movie.The whole movie felt like it was written by a 9th grader stuck in the Playboy fantasy he has playing in his head.I'm done.

This movie goes wrong in so many ways. First off, let's face it, Ben Affleck isn't exactly what you'd call a \"Good\" actor, the only really fun thing about Ben is that he's able to make fun of himself in Kevin Smith movies- except for Jersey Girl- but that's something else completely. Lucky for Ben, he ends up being paired with an actor that usually can carry the movie, and cover the Affleck, and even make a Ben Affleck Movie slightly more interesting- well - even Charlize Theron couldn't save Reindeer Games - but I'm straying again. Jennifer Lopez is pretty much the same. She is a better actress than she is a singer, and that's not saying much, but two bad leads and a horrible story make for an unbearable viewing experience.It's hard to explain where the movie starts to go wrong (besides casting)- but after about 10 minutes of watching this piece of crap, you'll wonder why you haven't turned off the TV. What's sadder is that the movie seems to try desperately to get the viewer to cling unwilling through a totally useless tag-a-long with Turret's syndrome- which is only funny if your eight (a la Deuce Bigelow)- and Lopez's Lesbian turns Straight (or Bi is you like) is pathetic! But the fun doesn't stop there, there isn't one thing that can be said about this movie - seriously - even the title causes many problems- that should be a sign - but that didn't stop me.My Advice?

Not in terms of quality, since I wouldn't argue that that's basically subjective, but just professionalism. Like little moments in the script that make you think how the hell did no one speak up about that and fix it. I didn't find Ben very believable as the tough gangster, and expected to have the same reaction to J-Lo's character, but I actually found her performance really good. The retarded kid character was just bizarre. I have no idea what they were going for with most of the lines he had. It seemed like the guy couldn't even deliver them with a straight face, like he stifled a snicker after everything he said, like the actor knew how stupid everything he was saying was. I'm sure that wasn't the case though. It was just bizarre. I can't imagine what they were going for. He obviously wasn't believable as a mentally retarded person. It seemed like maybe he was a parody retarded person, but why do you need to parody something that can already be funny anyway when it's played straight? The character reminded me of Tom Green's style of absurdist comedy where the whole point is just to be random and insane and unexplainable.

Essentially, they kidnap a guy with a disability under duress from a mobster, and then practically nothing happens. I'm serious. Yes, there is the whole \"finger\" thing but they can't even make that dynamic. After that it's pretty much just pointless scene after pointless scene until the sex scene between Lopez and Affleck. This movie reminds me of Super Mario Brothers in terms of how much time it wastes doing nothing and being boring. And the end, pretty uneventful. It reminds me of one of the things I've learned as a b-movie watcher. Almost anyone can handle a bad horror or sci-fi movie, but only b-movie warriors should watch bad comedies.",

Keep in mind, that just because it was rated #1 worst movie of all time, doesn't actually mean that. That's because only registered users votes count. For me, some of the movies that are on the bottom 100 list, I can admire, and even like.  I can imagine that there are a million worse movies other than \"Gigli\". Yet I haven't seen it. But I would imagine that Martin Brest didn't do that bad. The reason it was rated the lowest, is also because it grew so much publicity. Why? Well, because it was the first movie with American's most talked about couple. And again, because registered users votes only count. For me, some of the movies that are on the bottom 100 list, I can admire and even like. There are a million low-budget \"B\" film that could of made the bottom 100 list, but they don't make it because not enough IMDB users don't see them. They don't get spread out among society and they don't make it to the movies.So, next time you comment on a film, keep this in mind, and perhaps actually SEE the movie.

I thought Justin Bartha was brilliant as Brian, the mentally challenged victim of this farce.    A performance reminiscent of Rainman, but not nearly as refined nor inspired as Dustin Hoffman, still a bright spot in an otherwise dismal film.

The movie isn't even half as bad as the critics made it sound. Clearly, they let all the Bennifer backlash obscure their thoughts. Was it amazingly fantastic? No. But it doesn't deserve to be on a list for one of the worst movies of all time. The movie is about a hit-man and a lesbian hit-woman, if you will, and how they have to watch over a mentally disabled boy they have kidnapped. The plot line is a little all over the place and I don't think the movie really needed to be two hours long, but all in all it wasn't that bad. Ben Affleck acted what he was given, sure sometimes he was a bit over the top, but that was his character. I'm not sure why everyone was so surprised by Jennifer Lopez's performance. Every single character she has ever acted has been the same. So to expect her to all of a sudden deliver something mind-blowing is stupid on your part. I'm not bashing her by any means, just know what to expect. She also was in the most amazing shape I have ever seen her in. If you're a guy, that should be reason enough right there to see the movie. The lack of chemistry between them people keep talking about I sure didn't see. I felt the chemistry. There were parts where you can catch Ben Affleck almost smirking at Jennifer Lopez. A look where you could tell he really was smitten over her. Another part the critics slammed was how a lesbian fell for a guy. \"That is so unrealistic\". How many movies are realistic? I mean are we kidding?? It's a movie. I thought Justin Bartha did a great job in his role as the mentally disabled boy. I found it totally believable and the movie ended perfectly for him. The two cameos, Christopher Walken and Al Pacino, were completely unnecessary and odd. I enjoy both of them as actors very much, but there was no point for them to be in the movie. Basically, I have no intention of owning this flick, but I feel it has been picked on over and over again because of a few opinions. Which in turn made everyone else give it bad reviews, because it would be insanity for anyone to think an original thought on their own. Go see the movie and decide for yourself.",

Then enters Ricki(Jennifer Lopez), a lesbian hitwomen that is assigned to watch Larry and make sure he dosen't screw this very important job up.  The film just goes on from there, which adds up in the end but not greatly.The story is stupid, and much of the dialouge between them is stupid and pointless, but the part of the film that made me actually not hate this film is the preformance by Justin Bartha as the 'Rain Man' clone, he makes you care about him and makes you smile at some of his actions.\nThere are plenty of films coming and that are already out that are a lot better then this film and deserve your time and money, but this film is not as bad as people and critics have said.",

I never cared about Hollywood romances and never will, so I approached this movie with no bias against or for them. I was aware of all the extremely negative press this film had been receiving, so I saw this little title out of curiosity.  Like all other potential Razzie candidates, I try to keep an open-mind when watching these films.  For example, I'm one of the few that enjoyed Little Nicky quite a bit and still think the Razzies were off their rocker nominating this over real crap like Dungeons and Dragons.  Upon renting the DVD from the store, popping it into the player and hitting 'Play', a whole new world of pain erupted.Gigli is not as bad as the critics have been saying, it's much worse and cannot be describe with any word in the English language relating to \"bad\"This has got to be one of the most painfully paced, poorly scripted and horrendously acted films that have ever met the camera lens.  I still cannot get it through my head that a studio spent 85 MILLION on this one project alone, what the hell did they spend the budget on when the film mostly took place in Gigli's apartment?  Oh, of course...the addition of new respected Oscar-winning actors to the project, (more on that later).  First off, let me just say that Martin Brest has got to stop pretending he's Quentin Tarantino because he just cannot compare to a man who has Pulp Fiction under his belt.  Tarantino creates characters that we can respect and relate to...Brest creates a mentally-challenged character who is a cheap shot to anyone with the  affliction.  Tarantino writes excellent scripts that contain careful detail and develop characters to their full potential...Brest creates a scene where Lopez talks about her reproductive organ and includes the line \"It's turkey time.  Come on, gobble gobble.\". I just feel dirty for typing that line alone when I could have used that memory to write something intelligent.The acting is nothing more than a waste, and when it is used it is horribly executed.  Lopez needs to read the script and understand who her character is.  She cannot go from design-to-design changing from a sensitive figure to a serious fighter failing at every turn.  Ben Affleck needs to break out, I see some degree of potential in him...yes, you heard me...and needs to find what he's good at and work at that.  As for the rest of the cast, I want to ask a serious question: how did Christopher Walken and Al Pacino end up in this film when they have an incredible amount of talent still left in their tank?  Why does Walken and Pacino arrive in one scene, give a horribly written personal monologue which no one has any right to care about, then disappear from the film never to be heard from again?  Speaking of horrible monologues...did I mention they are horrible? I seriously simply lost interest five words into them, they are that poorly conceived and executed.I need a separate paragraph for this one: the music in here is so abysmally composed one must listen to it to gain it's full impact.  If you're willing to sacrifice your hearing you must give it a listen.  It is in essence one poorly-composed piece of music that plays during \"emotional and sensitive\" moments that sounds like it loops every five seconds.  It haunts this film and just when you think you are rid of it...it arrives to assault your precious eardrums.You know, I think this is the best, (or worst?) decade for bad films...taking a look at the last 3-4 years of Razzies and you can see why those guys are going to have a field day for the next six years or so.1.0/10",

I mean the characters are total idiots and a few questionable scenes like how could Ben Affleck get away with kidnapping someone from an institution and cutting off a thumb in a morgue with a butter knife without getting confronted by authorities or a little thing called security cameras. this movie was total garbage, and I'm glad I only paid $3.00 to watch it at the theatre instead of $8.50. I mean Ben Affleck has done some bad movies in the past but by far this one has to be the worst, it's the icing on the cake.

Of course she would give up her identity to fall in love with Ben. Of course her character would use crude jokes, such as the gobble, gobble turkey one. Of course she would have to be super hot and hip for us to like her as a lesbain...this is Hollywood. JLo has made a career of playing awful, superficial, stereotypical parts. The violence was sick. Unlike nuanced films, it showed off. In Reservoir Dogs, Tarantino makes us think we are seeing more violence with the ear slicing scene, but we never do see the actual ear sawed off. In this film, you get treated to a finger sawed off by a plastic knife. The kidnapped guy was supposedly mentally handicapped. Like most untalented writers, actors, and directors, the team that made Gigli depicted a mentally handicapped person as a bumbling, whining, grunting moron. Yepp, integrity is rampant in this film. Finally JLo and Ben force the chemistry thing so much it becomes non existent. They are not portraying characters, they are merely caught up in themselves, forcing the issue. Yes, not all films are Oscar winners. Some are solely for entertainment. This one is merely trash. That budget of 50 million should be divided up among 5o talented young indie directors because they at least have something to say. And JLO, darling, please stick to singing dumb songs and talking about your ass. It is all you are worth.

He works for some guy name Lewis who tells Ben(Gigli rhymes with really) to get someone so he can control someone who he can't control.

The someone is a Mentally Challenged boy who made some of the audience members laugh when he would suddenly shout out a sucession of curse words. which is something he did a lot. He's always asking Ben to take him to the Baywatch. I could already imagine that later in the film Ben would take him there and Ben would eventually learn to like him. He basically bugs Ben. For example he asks Ben to read to him but Ben doesn't have a book so he reads a Tabasco label. Jen finally shows up to help him. Everything is extremely slow paced. Then a cop shows up at Ben's apartment. That's when I couldn't take it anymore and left. It is really a terrible movie. You've been warned.",

Insipid storyline.The Jennifer Lopez marketing machine rolls on.  But, as we all know, it's not about quality in Hollywood, it's about money.  Stay as far away from this POS as you possibly can, you'll be a better person for it.This is not just ordinary bad in a 'Bad Boys II' sort of way, but a hypnotic, black hole of a movie that sucks reputations, careers and goodwill down its vortex. Rarely has a movie that doesn't star Madonna achieved such a skin-crawling mixture of deluded 'look at me, I'm a star' and bungled humour.Bad Ben plays a low-level Italian-American enforcer, living in Los Angeles, who is named Larry Gigli.  To signify his retro macho values, he wears striped bowling shirts and a pompadour of a Grease extra, shrugs and waves his hands and shouts a lot.  In the mob world he inhabits, apparently devoid of other Italian-Americans or opera fans, no one can pronounce his surname which, he explains \"rhymes with 'really.' \"  Creative writing at its finest.Soon the humour really begins to boil.  Gigli's perpetually irascible boss Lou (Lenny Venito) assigns him to kidnap the teenaged, brain-damaged younger brother (Justin Bartha) of the district attorney in an attempt to pressure him to drop charges against a New York gang boss.Back at his one-bedroom apartment, Gigli yells at Brian, who spouts obscenities back until the doorbell rings.  Enter Bad Jennifer Lopez, whose major contributions to the film are front and back cleavage.  She calls herself Ricki, and she has been sent by Lou to make sure that Gigli doesn't screw up his assignment.Her character, devoid of any believable history, quotes Sun Tzu  (yeah, right!) and threatens unruly teens by sashaying up to them in her miniskirt and describing a fictional martial-arts move that tears out the visual cortex and deprives its victim of all visual memory.Watch this movie to completion and the procedure may actually sound tempting.The scene with Al Pacino as the New York mobster, is a lesson for all in truly large-scale bad acting.  Initially, Pacino vamps like a swish fashion designer and then spends the rest of the scene bellowing (gee, there's a stretch).Apart from the movie's wordy, tasteless dialogue, awkward pacing and tacked-on ending, the biggest failing is the misguided celebrity casting.  Both Affleck and Lopez are light-as-a-bubble presences, marginably bearable when attached to stronger actors, but they're hopelessly out of place in a character-driven black comedy.",

The mainstream gay&lesbian critics who complain about Ben converting yet another lesbian are prudish, politically correct bores. In fact the movie's central point about sexuality is that there is really a spectrum, not just two extremes, and a lot of the more strident critics might be less upset if they could understand this message, but they don't.Christoper Walken also does what he does best for a few minutes, which is always enjoyable, and Al Pacino does what he does best for a few minutes.So if you excuse the flat soundtrack and the irrelevant plot superstructure, this movie is worth watching, if only to get in the face of everybody who hates it so much.",

So the mafia guy tells the other guy to kidnap a retarded guy who eats sunflower seeds and wants to be in Baywatch but he doesn't look like the guy with the red swimming shorts.

Let's face it: if one does not motivate himself to see what's not on the \"radar screeen\" and accept what the media offers in it's place, you have a pitiful situation. The majority fall into this. However, if one does have the ability to see through the media's machinations and is determined to find true quality (be it in the great classics or in contemporary obscure cinema) one can only benefit himself and broaden his taste. Today's movie industry constantly churns out inferior products to an unsuspecting public. Today's Hollywood is a far cry from the superior directing and quality films that were made over fifty years ago. The public is too lazy to have any insight in this. The remedy to the problem of inferior acting, inferior directing and inferior plots is to boycott the cinemas.

I admit that I've been long a tolerant follower of Martin Brest's works, The re-imagining of \"Scent of A woman\" and \"Meet Joe Black\" although both not anything outstanding, i would say Marty have a penchant for being able to work the sparks between his main protagonists...take Chris O'donnels and Al Pacino's in SOAW or Brad Pitt's and Claire Forlani's and Hopkins in MJB. I am not to sure whether the chemistry between Ben and Jen happened throughout the production or after or before, but regardless,I can say that in Gigli the two characters chemistry works out just fine.  Sure its a film which seems to has lost in touch on what genre should it belongs to, and hell, I don't deny that theres some amazingly bizzare occurence  that happened within the film, memorable writings suddenly interwoved with some really surreal lines, truly the writer/director (here being Mr Brest himself) had either alot of chutzpah or too much caffeine to allow it all spill in the final cut, ppl who had seen this  know what I ment; yeah it's that whole \"gobble, gobble\" thing, and such bizarre concoctions occurs now and then through out the film. The acting job ranges from Above Decent to Mediocre, short wise no one really gave a shameful performance as it was so bluntly subjected through those Razzie awards thing,Ben Afleck is naturally the same man-boy he usually plays, here to his benefit, as the role seems to fit himself just fine; lightweight.Jlo carries herself with ease into the Bisexual contractor character,and this kind of sultry never broke a sweat role seems to fit her really well, its just too bad about the sometimes awkward dialogue she was given.The guy who played the Mentally disabled young man was okay,not being fleshed out enough I think, the dude who played Gigli's boss did some pretty funny impersonation of Bobby De Niro, but if its purposely done, then I must say its a guilty pleasure.C. Walken in a very brief appearance didn't fail to deliver, the thing with Walken is that no matter how brief he appears in a film you'll always left wanting for more. Al Pacino, seems to be doing a favour by fitting into a one day shooting schedule, and he does what Al Pacino usually Do, Screams out his lines in a thunderous tone at some climaxing point & add about 678 punctuation mark at the end, and you can tell that he enjoys it, and so do we, although his scene in this film seems to belong in film that might be called \"Devil's Advocate redux (with a touch of organized crime)\" ..hence just making this film more bizzare. Oh yeah...the whole argument-of-Vagina-and-Penis-whilst-doing-yoga  thing, was intriguing, yet the presented scene plays out like some sort of Andy Warhol type of motion picture piece, its just weirding some of the audience out of their sense, it might be the misplaced background music, it might be the kitschy aura , I've no idea frankly...it could be that Martin Brest is thinking way ahead, and we as an Audience are simply not ready for the ahead-of-trend mumbo jumbo he tries to apply here. Other than that Gigli's flaws seems to occur from the hype that surrounds its release, sure, lets say ..what if Ben and Jen was never enganged, or at the time wasn't Hollywood's first page material then I suppose Gigli would do just alright, its a bad film sure, but its 5 out of 10 bad, not 1.9 out of 10...oh yee cruel world.",

Truthfully, I wasn't shocked at all to see that this dismal motion picture had made it all the way to the top of the \"Bottom 100 of all time\" films.  J-lo as a lesbian doesn't work.

NOT!  Jen's Cutesy \"Gobble, Gobble\" line almost got me to leave the theatre, but like all who love to watch a good car wreck, I had to stay 'til the bitter end.  I think casting Mr. Affleck as a Hit Man was a very bad mix too.  He should have just whacked himself in the opening scene and I could have stayed home and save $7.50.  These two people are way too full of themselves to be for real. Truthfully, my theory on the whole thing is this:  They both took little or no salary to do the film in return for a % of the gross. ( ben is famous for this routine )  then the editing process began and the 2 realized that they messed up majorly for not taking the money and running.  So they conjured up this \"relationship\" thinking they would be the talk of the universe (which they were) and people would go to see the film regardless of its appeal. Then once the film opened, they could go their seperate ways (ie the stripper story in last week's Enquirer).  Now they will break up and maybe sympathy will rouse video & DVD sales next week when this trash is yanked from the once Silver Screen.  There's my 2 centablos.  Stick to singin' and shakin' J-lo.

I wouldn't call it good, but it's no worse than any number of movies that come out all the time, and it actually has a few funny moments, and some almost touching romantic scenes. The biggest problem is that it has one of those annoying, only in the movie's, mentally challenged characters that accidentally teaches those around him valuable life lessons. But a lot of critics gave positive reviews to Radio, so that couldn't have been their problem with this movie. No, I think what was really going on was that a lot of critics were reviewing the Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez relationship, not the movie. Now, I admit to thinking about that occasionally during the movie, like during a sex scene, I kind of wondered if that's the face Ben really makes with Jennifer in that situation, but I guess those thoughts might come up in any movie where the leads are involved, so it's not really that big a deal. It seems critics went overboard with their dislike of the stars by critical overkill. Ben Affleck struggles a bit with his Noo Yawk accent, and he's a bit miscast as a gangster, but otherwise is passable, and I think Lopez gave a better performance than the movie might have deserved.

It was a bit slow but not all romcoms are fast paced. I thought it was a very enjoyable Sunday afternoon flick. The characters developed as the movie went on and went from unlikable to likable. I wish Walken had a bigger role so that was a mystery. Pacino was great. The actor who played the abducted brother (name escapes me) was amazing. Afleck was good as usual. Jlo was sexy and charming. A bit unbelievable as a lesbian gangster but hey, it's Hollywood. She always plays a great lead romantic interest even though in this film she was a sometines flirtatious lesbian. There was comedy and heartfelt drama. I would watch it again.",

            "content": "Spoiler Alert I thought the general idea of the movie was a good one, but it was very slow-paced, mostly because it focused on these two characters having lots of quiet moments with very looooooooong dialogue. (Whatever happened to ambient sound and a composer's soundtrack). It was supposed to be about two people falling in like/love while caught up in a kidnapping scheme. However, most of the movie took place in Ben's character's apartment with the two of them making wisecracks and finally \"getting to know each other better.\" It had a comedic tone, then out of nowhere it was like the writer or whoever decided that they better get back to that kidnapping thing. That's when Al Pacino, who I love, shows up being loud and boisterous as usual and out of nowhere blows someone's brains out. Then everybody looks so serious all of a sudden. Everyone in my theatre was like \"What the hell just happened?\" I thought a better job should have been done moving the kidnapping theme along and at the same time watching the characters fall in love. Especially because the kidnapping part was just resolved so fast and easy at the end, like \"time to the end the movie now!\" They definitely used the F word more times here that I've ever heard in anything, even the most gangsta of movies. Sometimes like 5 times in one sentence as subject, verb and direct object. Not like I object to it, but it can be overused.  I did like the idea and I couldn't wait to see Ben and Jen on screen together. But it was pretty bad. I didn't expect the extreme sexual overtness between them in a couple of scenes. I wanted to see them be sexy together and all, but not gutter. I was kinda shocked. However, I did enjoy the supporting character that played Brian, the kidnappee. He was pretty funny and entertaining. He gave me something to hold out for where the plot was lagging and way tooo serious for the tone that was set up and maintained pretty much everywhere else. I wasn't mad when I left, just disappointed that it wasn't a great as it could have been. I expected more from Ben after seeing him grill people on Project Greenlight. And Scent of a Woman is one of my favorite movies, so I can't believe Martin Brest didn't see all the places this was going wrong in ye ole editing room. Maybe, like me, he just didn't need to see it more than once.",

Basically the two criminals (played by Ben Affleck and Jeniffer Lopez) fall in love on a job (babysitting a mentally handicapped young man) this results in a hearty amount of laughs, interesting cameos, tarrantinoesque dialog etc.The way i see this movie, a perfectly acceptable (if not above average) romantic comedy.

Throughout their whole careers, do they not see a flop when they see one? Either they are both totally stupid or just totally psyched to work together, who knows?So I gave the film a chance and watched it. This is one of the worst films I have ever seen in my life!

But wait, now Gigli is 'really' about to get more real. White-trash hit man lays on the trash landfill style. You would think that Ben Asslick does this to show that he understands his character and that he wants us to understand his character-white-trash Italian hit man, we get it. But the trash isn't for us, oh no, it's for Jenny. Yes, nothing can make a lesbian go straight like a trashy guy. Let's see, there must be over a thousand trashy guys on Jenny's block alone, but her character maintains that she is a lesbian. So we are supposed to believe that one extraordinarily trashy man and a retard can convert her? But it's not just the plot that is unbearable. This movie contains some of the worst dialogue I have ever heard. In one scene, Jennifer Lopez tells Ben Asslick that it is 'Turkey time\u0085gobble, gobble'. I almost puked.

I heard the buzz and read the bad reviews but deep down I thought it couldn't be that bad - how wrong I was!!I think it would be fair to start with the positive points - Jennifer Lopez is by far the best thing in this movie and she is the one positive. Despite this, she has quite possibly one of the worst lines in celluloid history (think poultry).Now to the other side of the coin.  This was billed as a Ben Affleck-Jennifer Lopez movie and as such, there were always people who were going to hate this movie.  However, the dialogue is so bad (in fact, its hard to express just how bad it really is) that you sometimes you laugh at the badness but the laughter just masks the bitterness at having spent money on this.  Now to Ben Affleck, I really don't know what has happened to him since Shakespeare In Love and Good Will Hunting but his acting appears to consist of pulling faces of various levels of pain.  This is no exception. The rest of characters are just charactures - Ben Affleck's mother, the mad lesbian, the retard, Louis (who appears to have wandered off the set of Miami Vice) and in some cases are downright offensive.  Much has been made of the cameo appearances of Christopher Walken and Al Pacino - they do not make this movie.

If you enjoy those flick, also check out Get Rich or Die Trying and you might want to see Spartan starring Val Kilmer for a similar ride in cinematic excellence.

He cannot pull off this wannebe gangster character. Watching him hear is like watching an amateur.* The dialogue is awful. Have of it is about sex and which one of them (Affleck or Lopez) can outsmart the other. In fact, there are no good lines from this movie.* The retarded brother was so annoying, everytime he talked he said something that I guess was suppose to be funny and was just plain stupid. Half the time, he's just spouting rap songs.* The plot. Where was it? For gangsters, they sure had enough free time to read books, do yoga, have long, detailed conversations about nothing and go out in public with their kidnapped assailant. I still don't know why they kidnapped the kid.* The score. They kept playing this sentimental, light-hearted music as if this were a sweet Meg Ryan movie and it's not at all romantic.* The ending.

Quite how not one, not two, but three Academy Award winners came to participate in Gigli is a conundrum the solution to which ought to result in a Nobel Prize. Not pointing any fingers, but the characterisation, direction and plot are all AWOL. It would appear that every poor soul appearing in front of the camera decided to ham it up in the hope that it would complement the inescapable cheese that crops up in every frame. That said, I believe that this film is destined for greatness. This is \"Showgirls\" for the gangster genre, a one star film that gets an extra star for effort. There are more laughs (admittedly unintentional) in this movie than in the last three Farrelly Bros. movies combined. At times jaw dropping in its absurdity (the infamous \"gobble, gobble\" invitation issued by J-Lo is a pale shadow of the other direlogue on offer here), this (romantic thriller? crime caper? redemptive drama? who knows what the creators were thinking?) is the kind of movie to watch while sitting round with a bunch of mates and an overabundance of snacks brimming with E-numbers. The comedy is cruelly underlined by the thin veneer of resigned desperation that inhabits every scene. In fact only the former Miss Lo appears to be playing it completely straight, apparently oblivious to the cinematic Rome in flames around her, and as a result, she gives her most enjoyable performance since Out Of Sight.Scenes to look out for include the Incident In The Diner, Yoga Before Bedtime and J-Lo On The Art Of War. I would also like to give a special mention to the fine individuals in charge of the music \u0096 for those of us who are blind (and lobotomised) the sound editing team have done a Grade A job of adding ceaseless crescendos of 'heart-warming' music, thus kindly providing the audience with emotional cues. Add to this the fact that J-Lo is possibly the worst lesbian in the history of cinema, and one half of the most inept pair of career criminals ever to sully the good name of organised crime, and what you have is a film that will form the keystone of many a student DVD collection for years to come. In fact, the only real criticism is that the film is about twenty minutes too long (but even here, the 'dramatic' pauses will no doubt have you smirking into your carbonated beverage).

I love plots about two peoples profound discussions in an apartment and a funny retard who gets made fun of all the time. You gotta love JLo forgetting her lines and disguising them as pauses in the conversation and how can you not love the idioth Al Pacino playing some mob boss.  He must have gotta a lot of money to be put in this.All of that said, it had ONE good part. JLo (the lesbian) argues with her friend about something you cant understand and Larry Gigli keeps poking his head in with funny comments. This all ends very climactically with her slitting her wrists. Of course, knowing this movie, she isnt mentioned again. The best part about watching this turd is trying to add random plot elements that would be shocking and funny, such as Gigli fighting a Sasquatch. The ending is genius, the poor mentally challenged individual gets into a baywatch set without any form of resistance while Gigli stands there for a long time watching the kid score. This is a great movie to show someone you hate, its the perfect way to do damage to somebody's mental physique, if you have a weak stomach, dont watch. There should have been a gargoyle.",

Something didn't add up -- many things didn't add up in this film.I had read that they used the f*** word 45 times in the first 15 minutes. I gave up counting at 61 about a half-hour or so into the feature. The profanity was used so often, it lost all value as a word. I felt the script was full of these verbal packing peanuts... ...and then came Turkey Time. I was horrified. The 10 or so people in the audience groaned... wow...

Just because this movie's expectations were high due to the whole \"Bennifer\" thing, this movie got nailed (as well as Jersey Girl which also had them both - Jersey Girl was actually a cute movie) very unfairly.Is it a good movie - of course not, but it was moderately entertaining at times and judging from other movies I've seen, it really wasn't all that bad nor does it deserve the title of \"worst movie ever\". The people who say that past \"critics\" have no clue what a \"bad\" movie is. As far as \"critics\" go, they often take themselves too seriously to begin with and most of the time they are incorrect in their assessments anyway.The plot was weak, the character arc wasn't there, the dialogue was borderline at times, and some of the jokes fell flat - but the movie wasn't meant to be taken seriously to begin with. It was just meant to be a somewhat entertaining movie and delivered what it was supposed to. This wouldn't be the first \"stupid\" comedy out there either. Gigli does have entertaining cameos from Al Pacino and Christopher Walken. Justin Bartha's performance as a mentally challenged person was actually good and underrated - lost among all the harsh criticism of this movie. Bottom line, if you watch moves for entertainment and can do so without taking things too seriously, then I would suggest watching it at least once. It may not be for everyone of course, but that would be generally every movie out there. If you actually do like to watch movies and watch them often enough, I think you'd find that this movie was certainly not as bad as the people caught up in the hype think. Don't expect a classic comedy either, but by no means is this the \"worst movie of all time\" - because it's certainly not.",

They kidnap a retarded Tourette's syndrome kid whose brother's a bigshot D.A. So presumably the kid's pic is all over the news, but that doesn't stop J-Lo & Ben from parading him all over town in a convertible (!) when they're not letting him cavort in front of a huge, highly visible picture window in their apartment or taking him to the beach or the store or a hospital. Even when they kidnap him from \"the home\" there's not a soul in sight to prevent it - no nurses, doctors, nothing. Didn't they have a continuity (or logic) person on the set who could've pointed this out? Good grief.Schmaltz reigns supreme, with lots of swelling heavenly choruses, a cliche \"redemption of the retard\" angle, and J-Lo and Ben duking it out for the painfully long close-ups time, with the lion's share, inexplicably, going to Ben. Embarrassing scenes of Ben flexing shirtless in front of a mirror for what seems like hours, calling himself \"the bull!\" (J-Lo's his \"cow\" in his mind) will work your last nerve. Lots of faux-New Age chatter about Ben's possible \"feminine side\" and J-Lo wanting him to put on mascara. Gigli (\"rhymes with really\" as fluttery-eyed Ben keeps reminding us) is cheese, and given the last-minute press screenings the filmmakers must know. They should be scared.

Yet, she did not ask Sony Pictures & Revolution Studios to postpone Gigli's release. There was a lot of empty seats at the Mann National Theatre in Westwood, California during its premiere 2 Sundays ago.  This meant that a lot of the invited people did not bother to show up.  What Sony's PR people did was to fill up the empty seats by allowing the cordoned-off fans to enter the theatre.The good news is that no movie star is immune to \"bad karma\".  Even Julia Roberts had a stinker (Mary Reilly).  In 1993, based on advance marketing tests, TriStar Pictures knew that Mary Reilly was going to bomb in the box office.  The thinking was either to keep the movie in storage forever or to release it straight to video.  However, TriStar chose simply to postpone its release --- for more than 2 years!  Still, when Mary Reilly was finally shown in theatres after the \"bad karma\" about it had died down, nobody showed up.  But Julia survived this, and how.Benny Medina of Handprint Entertainment (JoLo's former manager whom JLo fired recently after 8 years of faithful service) must be smiling today. Will JLo go ahead with her lawsuit against Benny?  Benny promised to fight to the end.  Let's see who will back off first.Bob & Harvey Weinstein of Miramax Films must be busy right now planning a revised marketing strategy for Jersey Girl in order to avoid a similar fate that Gigli is suffering.  It's slated for release before the year ends. Will Miramax move its release?Hopefully, Ben Affleck is not bad karma.  Gwyneth Paltrow's star seemed to have dimmed after her publicized pairing with Affleck.  But, at least, their 2000 movie Bounce did much, much better in the box office.  Affleck has a new action movie coming up (Paycheck).  Will he recover with this movie?Gigli proves that a good writer/producer/director (Martin Brest) can lose his touch and elements.  Brest directed the megahit Beverly Hills Cop in 1984.  This was the movie that made Eddie Murphy a megastar.  Brest was the producer and director of Scent of a Woman (the movie in which Al Pacino finally won an Oscar) and the Brad Pitt & Anthony Hopkins movie Meet Joe Black.  Brest was the writer and director of 1979's funny Going In Style, with George Burns & Art Carney.Gigli also proves that an Oscar-winning screenwriter such as Affleck (for Goodwill Hunting) can misread a bad script.  Maybe, Affleck did not contribute to any rewrite of Gigli's script and he just concentrated on acting in it.The way I see it, the only way JLo and Affleck will pair up in a movie again is if, by a miracle, Jersey Girl becomes a box-office hit.  Otherwise, as a movie pair, they're as good as divorced/Hollywood style.It used to be that whatever JLo touched always turned to gold.  Not anymore. She must now feel like Oprah Winfrey did when Oprah's pet film project Beloved bombed big time despite Disney's muscle and support.  Hopefully, unlike Oprah seemed to have done, JLo will not gain weight as a result.",

So, film of the year, Gigli is not. The cast looks bewildered, the script is insane, and both leads have gotten so good at faking on-screen chemistry that it's embarrassing. But that's nothing new. The question we should be asking ourselves is not, 'how could they make this THING?!' but, 'why on earth do we keep putting up with it?'",

            "content": "I have to believe that everyone involved with this movie knew it was a mess as they were making it.  What I don't understand: why didn't the director have the guts to stop production and send the script back for a rewrite. The biggest problem this movie had was dialogue, or rather, the absence of a writer who knew how to write dialogue.  It was obvious that Affleck could barely get his lines out with a straight face.  The other major problem was editing.  Numerous and seemingly endless scenes of music and no dialogue; while an improvement over the dialogue, did nothing to further the movie's plot, rather, they simply prolonged and slowed the pace of the movie, when just the opposite was necessary.An hour into the movie I found myself looking at my watch, shocked to find that it had only been an hour.  The performances were fair, hardly worth mentioning.  Justin Bartha, who played the kidnap victim, gave the strongest performance and one has to wonder why the movie wasn't named for him, as that might have actually made sense.The cameos ranged from the bizarre and unexplained appearance of Christopher Walken as a police officer, to the humorous, but over-done flirtatious mother, played by Lainie Kazan, to the over the top and scene stealing cameo of Al Pacino as a violent and conscienceless crime boss.I'm not sure that this movie could have been made much better, other than not having been made at all, but it certainly won't inspire future collaborations between the current it couple, Affleck and Lopez. Affleck's performance was rigid and stunted, while Lopez was charming, but ultimately about as deep as the rest of the plot.Over all, this movie was painful.  Slow, boring, and funny when it didn't intend to be, if only because the dialogue was so bad.  Wait for it on cable.  Don't even bother with video.",

Adversely the speeches about sexuality in the film along with the tension between Larry and Ricki don't work. The previews for this film were a cheat, they didn't even hint at the real story. While the acting is mediocre, it is not the weakest point in the film. Some parts were comical, but largely the writing along with the lack of real character development ruins the potential for the comedy the audience thought is was going to get from the previews. If they were to remake the film, they would need to take out Ricki's dilemmas with her sexuality and cut down on the cussing to make it a success. I realize the cussing was an attempt at life-like conversation in that occupation, but you need to be able to understand the other words coming out of the characters mouth in order to get the story. Definitely not one of the best films of the 21st century.",

Only they jacked it all up: instead of cute kid, we'll go with a retard.

It was almost sad, especially since it was the beginning of the end for Bennifer I, and there was so much hype around the movie. The only thing that makes this movie worth seeing, and makes a great story to tell at parties, is the \"she makes my penis sneeze\" line. Now THAT was funny!

Even the viewing public came back frustrated. (That's why that, as of mid-August 2003, this movie was #1 on the IMDb.com bottom 100 list.)   \"Gigli\" gives Jennifer Lopez more incentive to focus mainly on her singing career. Sure, \"Maid in Manhattan\" had success, but this Jennifer Lopez movie did not, and J.Lo could be to blame. Diversity is clearly not one of her strong suits.   Ben Affleck was the headliner of this movie. He has talent, sure, but he really should stick to drama (i.e. \"The Sum of All Fears\"). The comedy in this movie, as bleak as it is, is only impaired by Affleck's poor delivery.

All these movies are much, much worse than Gigli.Don't get me wrong; this movie is terrible, and it really never should've been made. But it does have a few redeeming qualities to it. First, Jennifer Lopez isn't hard to look at. She's not much of an actress, but at least she's not hard on the eyes. Second, Christopher Walken and Al Pacino both did an amazing job, considering what they had to work with (which admittedly wasn't much).Now, the downside. The dialogue was terribly written. Many times I found myself laughing out loud at how badly the dialogue was written and delivered. The plot doesn't seem to go anywhere. Walken and Pacino didn't really have a reason for being in this movie. J-Lo and Ben had horrible chemistry.

It's all of that crap about the developing relationship between the two leads that just makes the whole story seem to drag.  The dialog they exchange was just embarrassing... \"God bless you penis!\"... what the hell is that???  Equally embarrassing was J. Lo's New Jersey mobster accent. What was the big deal about why Ricki didn't want anybody to know her name? If she's so great at performing covert operations, how did her ex-girlfriend find her so fast? How about when Louis gets his brains blown out?  The back of his head splatters against a huge fishtank a few feet directly in back of him... but the exiting bullet completely misses the fishtank?  And we get to enjoy the blood oozing out of the entrance wound, but where's the mess spilling out of the exit wound?  Certainly not soaking into the couch cushion his head is resting on. If Starkman is so convinced that the d.a. will trace his brother Brian's kidnapping back to Starkman, why would he even think about killing the only people who knew where Brian was stashed?  Wouldn't that put Starkman in a bigger fix? The whole ending was just too incredible to believe... the whole Beach Rage scene was just ridiculous.  Gigli decides that he and Ricki should split up and disappear to avoid facing retribution from the mob.  So he needs to get rid of his easily recognizable antique Impala convertible.  And how does he do that?  He gives it to her!  If the mob can trace the car to him, then giving it away would lead the mob to whomever has the car... in this case, her! I thought the \"mentally challenged\" character had some funny lines and that Bartha did a good job combining Hoffman's Rainman and DiCaprio's Arnie Grape.  And I did enjoy Walken and Pacino in their respective cameos.  I thought it was apt that Ben and Jen had few, if any, lines during those scenes... since the two leads in this movie could never hope to attain the acting abilities of either Walken or Pacino.  Dismal sales at the box office will guarantee a short theater run, but that only means we'll be reminded of the whole mess when the cable movie channels start showing it over and over again in two months.  Then there's the DVD and video release!  Hopefully, no one will forget what a dog this was when BenJen release their next flick in 2004.",

She is played by Jennifer Lopez. Jennifer is simply charming and sexy, and I think she'll get out of this bomb without any bad bruises. But Ben Affleck killed his career here.

So I could justify sitting for the entire 2 hours. Was it the worst film ever? No. But man, someone should have had the cojones to say to the people in charge `Stop. Just stop.'Martin Brest really has to get over himself. His writing and directing keeps getting muddy and I can only think hubris coupled with a sense of entitlement is to blame. This film is a good example of someone taking himself WAY too seriously. What on earth was he thinking when he wrote, `I am the Sultan of Swat'? `I am the original gangster's gangster'? `I'm the bull, you're the cow'? And don't get me started on the yoga posing/vagina-penis monologue! I don't think actors with 2 Oscars could have made that script sound good. And speaking of the script, where the hell was the plot? The beginning was just about getting through it so that we could introduce Jennifer Lopez' character and their ensuing sexual tension. Ricky and Gigli are barely watching this guy who is unpredictable and they seem to be pretty relaxed about the whole thing. This is even after the cop shows up, played by Christopher Walken who was in only one scene, and then we never see him again. And what was he saying? I actually had to put on the subtitles and watch the scene over to understand. Pacino was also in just one scene. And thank God, because his yelling is getting worse. If you want to know if Pacino feels he is in a bad movie, just listen for how much he yells. The more he yells, the louder he yells, the worse the movie is. And then there's psycho lesbo girlfriend who comes in for one scene and attempts to kill herself. Ok, we've proven that Ricky is really a lesbian so we can get rid of the dumped girlfriend. On to the next shot!Ben Affleck as a gangster? And exactly what accent was he doing? Italian, New Jersey by way of Staten Island? He was funny in the mirror talking to himself, but overall the macho bit seemed very, well.acted, and not very well. He niche is playing underdogs with vulnerability, but where was the hardened criminal? Jennifer Lopez - yes, yes, yes, we know she looks good. But she is supposed to be a hardened lesbian gangster for hire. Where did she find the time to keep her hair so coiffed and keep lip gloss on her lips? And why oh why am I forced to see her ass all the time? When and how did her behind become part of the story? This time it was the butt crack as she laid items on the floor to make a bed. And why the yoga stuff? What was the point in that? To show why Gigli was so frustrated? He could have just complained about the script. Her long monologues not only didn't make much sense and seem contrived, but Jennifer though talented, does not have the chops for that kind of dialogue. She and Ben didn't have the best on-screen chemistry I've seen, but I believed the attraction. But it couldn't help this mess of a movie.",

She just unloads so much non-sense that it make watching the film torture. And it doesn't help that SHE TALKS SO MUCH IN The FILM.

            "content": "+CONTAINS SPOILERS+ Surprisingly Gigli wasn't as bad as I'd braced myself for.  Then again that was after hearing it had received not one positive review and was being compared to all time stinkers like Showgirls and Glitter.  My girlfriend wanted to see it, and I went along thinking if it was that bad I'd at least get a few laughs in at just how bad it was.Mind you I'm not saying the film was good.  The story, which there isn't much of kind of fades in and out.  I found the film to be very, very offensive in the way it portrayed homosexual people and handicapped people. That gay people would be so wishy-washy about their sexuality, and end up in bed with someone as disgusting as the character of Gigli after saying redundantly that the character was a lesbian seemed very backwards, and not in a Chasing Amy sort of way.  Then the character of Brian who at first seemed to be a mish-mash of every mental handicap producers or writers thought audiences might get a laugh out of.  Tourettes, ticks, it was all there.  As fas as I could see the character was only written as a handicapped person to provide comic relief.  Very inappropriate.  Then as the movie progressed he became less and less incapacitated.  At one point about midway there was a funny scene where Brian is rapping with the radio in the kitchen.  I guess test audiences reacted well to that one scene because from then on it seemed that his characters only spouted bits of hip hop banter, Kings of Comedy style one liners, and more rap songs.  The worst case of running a joke into the ground til it was lifeless and annoying I have ever seen.  And Ben Affleck as Gigli.  I've never been a huge Ben fan. He seems to do the same thing more or less in every movie.  The same sly smile and swaggering.  He was like a bad flat charicature of every similar \"gangster\" type movie that's come before.  Christopher Walkien and Al Pacino's cameos were just...bizarre.  Especially Walkens, before you could figure out why he was there or what he'd said he was gone.\nAnd let's not forget the single most annoying thing about the movie...the music.  I guess nobody wanted their name associated with this stinker because they played the same snippet of arrangement over and over.  And it was the most jarring thing ever.  Like the music at the Oscars when it's time for you to get the heck off the stage.  Everytime there was what the powers that be thought might be a heart-warming moment there it was, when Gigli read to Brian, when a guy got his brains splattered everywhere.  See what I mean?  How do you play an orchestral sweep with something like that? By the last half hour it was like nails on a chalkboard.Gigli did deserve all the bad reviews it recieved.  Is it the worst movie ever?  Hardly.  Is it the worst movie this year?  Probably.  When a script is that bad, dialogue that vulgar for no reason, acting that bad it's just sorta doomed.my rating:D-",

Bad movies can be fun, sometimes I seek them out, sometimes they turn out to be unintentionally funny but the other times they bore the hell out of you. Gigli falls into the latter category. The biggest thing going against it, is, it's trying to be funny & stupid. How can you laugh at a poorly executed comedy? I am surprised that they used a retarded dude as comedy relief in these very PC times.Ben Affleck is awful as usual but I didn't think Jennifer Lopez' performance was too bad (for her.)Also, the movie is far too long and the fact that it sucks just begins to drain all of your energy and you're dying for it to end. There isn't one likable character.But, I believe that Gigli's reputation as the worst movie ever is undeserved. People love to jump on a bandwagon and even assume things about something they, themselves have never experienced first hand. It's popular to like some things and it's popular to hate other things. I bet most of the people that make fun of \"Glitter\", \"Gigli\" & \"Adv. Of Pluto Nash\" haven't even seen them. Those movies are small potatoes when there's crap like \"Reptilicus\" out there.",

The writing and the direction were both truely catastrophically bad. So isn't it weird that the director of this work of cinematic atrocity. There were several times I laughed during this movie, unfortunatly it was because I was wondering if it could get any worse, and than cracking up because some how it managed to get more unbearable with every passing moment. Its never smart to title your movie a word that no one knows how to pronounce, but luckily Ben Affleck clears that up in the beggining of the movie. He says his name is pronounced Jee-lee, you know rhymes with Really. But did any one notice that that doesn't rhyme? Certainly not the brain dead director/writer. I only went to see this cause I am a huge Ben affleck fan, and I'm hoping this film doesn't destory his career because mother of god it was that awful. The jokes were filthy renditions of the same lines over and over again. J.Lo - Laugh at me cause I say dirty words like pussy and cock. Ben affleck - be scared of me cause I say f*ck a lot. Kidnapped Retard - laugh at me cause I'm mentally challenged. I felt awful that the only times the audience laughed was when the mentally challenged character began to rap, yeah its funny, but look at what you have to resort to for laughter, go back to screenwriting 101 before you make another picture. Oh wait for all our sakes just never make another one. Oh and my favorite part was when Gigli (Affleck) was driving in a car and confesses his love to a lesbian which leads to their first kiss and eventually them falling for each other. Wow now I actually liked that part. But wait I liked it more the first time I saw it, in chasing amy, but this director couldn't pull off anywhere near the brilliance of Kevin Smiths writing of that scene. But I'm starting to think a room of full of chimps could have written a better movie than this fool. This is one time where you should belive the terrible reviews you hear, this movie was almost the worst movie ever, only because somehow a movie called from Justin to Kelly came out earlier this year.",

This movie created and intense odor that stunk up every theater that it was showed in. The people who saw it nearly took a noose and hung themselves in their seats.Now this movie was supposed to be a \"drama,\" but if this was a comedy, my god it would have been a blockbuster hit. It as all of the hints of a comedy: a pimp playa mack-daddy mob hustler (Ben Affleck) that has to take care of a retarded boy (some dude) that only wants to Baywatch. Then they soon meet up with a lesbian gang member (Jennifer Lopez) that is just there to make sure everything goes right. Now doesn't this sound like the perfect movie plot?Hell no, but they did it anyway.Now, Ben Affleck to play a pimp? I would understand maybe Snoop Dogg, but Ben Affleck? Come on, he couldn't even spell \"pimp\" if his life depended on it. He uses f*** in every sentence. That's not tight, that's stupid.Then, Jennifer Lopez? Well, not much to say. She explains herself.If anyone has ever seen this movie, they have been cheated out of 90 minutes of their now miserable life. I've seen this movie, and I don't have the urge to leave my bed anymore. (just kidding, OK?) I rented this travesty for $14.00, and I went to sleep after watching it for 12 minutes. I felt cheated! That's why they probably broke up, too.Final Roundup: Gigli was a movie that would live in the deepest, darkest part of movie history as the apocalypse of the drama series of movies. Thank god Ben regain his self-dignity in \"Paycheck.\"Cost of Making the movie: $54 million How much they raked in: A incredible, whopping, $4 millionJennifer was never saved after the movie, unfortunately.* Star(s) / **********",

I would rather watch Ron Jeremy go at it then have to hear Affleck speak in this film. Don't get me wrong I like some of Afflecks and Lopez's films. Gigli just wasn't one of them. Granted I only watched a few minutes and missed the beginning but I honestly couldn't bear to hear Affleck try and and attempt to make himself sound plausible.

Except for in Plan 9, I would like to think that the director knew the movie sucked before he released it.

He (the actor) is horrible. He is given the assignment of kidnapping a mentally retarded district attorney's brother. The actor who plays that guy is actually quite good, and the only reason at all to watch this movie. Then, Jennifer Lopez comes into the picture, which squeezed every last drop of hope out of my body for this to become B-movie level. Her character, Ricky, is a lesbian. Oddly enough, she seems to live only to tease Gigli. Who she shouldn't want. Oh wait, I'm actually thinking. During \"Gigli\". Silly me. There is also some subplot about Ricky's real name, which gets resolved at the end, but it is stupid and boring and should've been edited out.hilarious + horrible = hillarible.Hillarible performances by all (except for the actor who plays the handicapped man), but particularly J.Lo. Two monologues of particular note are made by one of Ricky's jilted ex-lovers and the other is J.Lo's famous yoga speech. Hillarible scenes...well, every scene is hillarible.\nA true turkey.

If their on-screen romance is any indication of how their real life romance will turn out, look for a divorce sometime next year.Don't get me wrong, I don't wish anything hurtful on either Lopez or Affleck in real life, but these two are doomed to fail together on screen. Their much hyped romance actually heightened my expectations for this film and I was sorely disappointed. I expected to see some real chemistry and instead saw two people looking sappy and over-the-top.It's hard to believe this film has received so much hype and it's sad to think that later on we have to hear about these two again in another film.

As I find myself liking, at least to some extent, most of the films I see, I wanted to see what a bad film was like. Overall, it was bad, but not truly awful as I had heard (#3 on the IMDB top 100 worst movies, as I'm sure you've seen).  There was very minimal character development, and even then it was so spasmodic it left your head spinning.  As if your head wasn't spinning enough, they throw in these random characters, without introducing them, who speak so you can't understand them.  The third time this happened, I almost rewound the scene to turn on the subtitles so I could have at least a vague idea what the man had said.  This leaves the viewer without a clue as to what's going on with the plot.  The characters seemed completely unconvincing.  For instance, a mentally retarded character that has an affinity with cursing and is highly focused on sex.  The dialogue was in some cases utterly stupid.  \"In every relationship there is a bull and there is a cow.  I am the bull!\"  Some cases it was just bad.  Some parts were so stupid that you weren't sure if you were supposed to laugh or not.  The scene leading up to the sex scene was entirely clich\u00e9.  J-Lo conveniently doing stretches on the floor in very suggestive poses while Affleck talks about his genitalia.  Some redeeming qualities: I personally really enjoyed the music in the film.  It fit in nicely with the scene.  Also, the ending was good, even though the plot throughout the rest of the film was pretty dumb.  Bottom line: somewhere between \"terrible\" and \"wait for home video.\" 4/10.",

There is resolution at the end, although rather abrupt, cliche, and really gross (why would the master need a 6 year old wife?), but Gigli has none of these things.  Manos was made almost 40 years ago on a bet by a fertilizer salesmen.  Manos had an excuse.  This, as Al Pacino tells us in his normal Al Pacino acting bravado during Gigli, is the twenty f*cking first century.  There is no excuse for this kind of crap to be passed off as a major hollywood movie.  Maybe at the Summer Indie Rainbow Film festival with the German film featuring a boy running through the forest and multiple shots of a bucket of water that symbolizes somehow that we need to throw out our computers and be one with nature, but not as a major Hollywood release.

The rambling profanity of the characters makes them as lovable and understandable as the stereotypical homeless bag lady with the shopping cart, cursing at someone who doesn't exist as she walks down some back alley.Perhaps a plot--or less than 9 simultaneous plots--might have helped. None of these stylish, overplayed, completely flat characters were convincing, and more often insulting to the characters they stole from.  I truly believe, from the Baywatch references in the movie, that this was a Cliff's Notes primer on Money Train, Chasing Amy, and Rain-Man, for those that never saw the films, and don't waste time concerning themselves with content or depth.I had the same feeling watching this movie as \"The Browning Version\", but not for the same reasons.  The Browning Version is a wonderfully depressing movie--it starts out with the characters in a bad situation, then slowly draws you farther and farther down into devastation.  You do this by participating with the characters. Gigli--well, you do this from the third party perspective.  Either way--near the end, you're ready to end it all.Just before the climactic ending of Gigli, my son asked me \"do you keep looking for the bots on the front row?\" I must admit, I had already thought of Manos twice.  We went directly home and watched it--and within two minutes were already laughing at \"imaginary elves\" in the Chevy training film.  It was the first time I'd heard him laugh, and realized it was the first time I'd laughed as well.Doesn't that fact prove that Gigli is worse than Manos?  Try it, Manos MST3k is an uplifting experience after Gigli.... Yikes!!!  This means that Brest is now the master!!!  Would HE approve? jeez... Affleck playing Michael, Rain-Man playing Torgo, Lopez playing both Margaret and Debbie at the same time!  She can handle that--there's not a full character between them, and she's more than qualified to play less than a full character (Money Train)That's it, use the same cast!! Remake Manos!!!

But then you have scenes such as the one in which Gigli expounds on being \"a gangster's gangster.\"  J. Lo doesn't buy it, and neither do we.  The chemistry is severely lacking, the sex scene bizarre, two hours was ridiculously long, the story very muddled and basically pointless, even Walken and Pacino can't spice this schlock up!  However, the most heinous of film crimes committed in this movie is John Powell's choice of music.  If the score that the movies opens to doesn't warn you enough, you obviously aren't paying attention.  The musical choices are made to ellicit certain emotions, but the happy, jivey music present in various scenes is horrific, the \"hey, we just found Jesus\" type found in such scenes as the \"Baywatch = sex\" scene, and the sweet and melancholy chords also played throughout is what makes the movie truly nonsensical and thus truly bad.

No entries in my lexicon will do this travesty justice, so I am forced to go into more detail than perhaps I would like, as I selflessly consider it my duty to prevent any other sentient being from watching this film, regardless of the trauma I may experience whilst doing so.When watching Gigli your first instinct is to dismiss it as a spoof. Any sensible person would quickly determine that there is no possible way that this was an accident. The direness of this film is so perfect, so spectacular and so expertly executed to the point where each scene could not have been any worse you have to conclude that it is the product of some extensive design.It would be safe to say that in a romantic comedy, albeit one devoid of any romance or comedy, gritty realism isn't that important an issue. However the when the scenes become so laughably unrealistic that you are wondering if you are the victim of an elaborate practical joke, where the on screen goings on couldn't possibly happen, under any circumstances anywhere in the world, when the saliva is dripping off of your tongue as it hangs out of your mouth in slack jawed astonishment, you begin to think something needs to be done.For example, in one scene, 'Ricky' played by a slightly built (buttocks excluded) florally dressed, five foot, five inches tall Jennifer Lopez strolls up to a gang of street hoods, and scares the living daylights out of them by describing a fictional martial arts technique in a silly accent. Now in reality, she would have been bundled into a van and raped. But in the world of Gigli the hoods suddenly behave like chastised children in front of the headmaster. Not to be out-done, as you take the now customary breath of relief as you sense the scene is coming to an end, Affleck's character 'Larry' grabs the laptop, breaks it in half and says 'Suck my dick dot com'. I swear to you dear readers, I am not making this up.I perhaps should mention that along with gangsters, who if they tried to extort you would be met with fits of giggles, is the other major protagonist. Just when you thought you could not be insulted any more, Justin Bartha plays 'Brian' and in doing so delivers a representation of someone with learning difficulties that is as trite and it is disgusting. The none-specified mental illness manifests itself with apparent social dysfunction, a love of 80s hip-hop and a propensity to offend complete strangers using profanity. Also he is quite fond of buxom women in bikinis. That shocking catalogue of inaccuracy not withstanding, at the point when Larry began reading Brian a bedtime story using text from the back of some toilet roll packaging I should have switched off. I regret to this very moment that I did not.I can't bring myself to go on. If I were a stronger man I would go into detail about the tragic cameos, the bafflingly inane dialogue, the solar proportioned plot holes and the infamous yoga scene, a scene so cripplingly terrible that even Jenny's camel toe couldn't save it, but I am exhausted.Astonishingly Lopez and Affleck got over $12,000,000 each for this garbage, so I urge you not to allow anyone to make another penny from it. I managed one hour and forty one minutes of this tat, but I switched off with only ten minutes to go. I did so because it seemed that the final scene was Brian, after being coached by Larry, stoically managing his severe learning difficulties and successfully chatting up some of the female members of the 'Bay watch' cast.Once again dear readers, I am not joking.",

As for Jennifer Lopez.. she had some pretty bad lines of dialogue that went on for awhile (as opposed to the one-liners Ben had).It seems that the best way to describe this movie in a nutshell is that it wants to be Chasing Amy meets a Tarantino movie, but it falls flat on its face when trying to do so.",

            "content": "....not that bad at all.No...SERIOUSLY.I may be the biggest JLo hater on the planet, but  I will be bold and say that they was quite a bit of GIGLI that I really liked.  There is a saying that what makes a great movie is \"3 good scenes and no bad scenes\".Well, GIGLI is not great.  In fact, its far from it.  It does have 3 truly inspired scenes (one involving Al Paccino and the other Christopher Walken...which were 2 of my favourite scenes this year!  They absolutely own their respective scenes) and the other involving Jennifer Lopez delivering a monologue that absolutely convinced me why I like girls.\nThere are many other good scenes as well.  The film has likeable characters, very good performances (especially by Lopez, who gets to play tougher and smarter than she is used to) and fun with the predicaments.  I also really found the dialogue to be quite smart and well-written and really be about something and not just things characters say for expository reasons.  When Gigli and the Lopez character spoke, I listened, and I liked the sexual frankness of their conversations, which swayed away from the standard movie conventions of the romantic comedy/drama.I can't say this film was terrible...its far from it.  What did bother me was how misguided it was and how dangerously slow-moving the first act was. Its third act, consequently, went on forever as well.  Also, the film was a serious misstep in tone...it truly does not know what it wants to be...Get SHorty-esque quirky comedy or Rain Man-esque drama.  Its shifts in tone were frustrating.All in all, a troubled - not terrible - film with 3 \"great scenes\", a few others, good performances, and some truly inspired dialogue.  Its a film that could have achieved more if more guided.As for the absolute critical backlash...I dunno.  I think that critics were criticizing the images of the two leads and didn't really and truly watch the film.  The two may be self-indulgent media whores, but does that give us the right to unanimously label their first cinematic venture as crap?  And when the world is caught up in \"let's label Gigli as the worst film ever...\" the momentum is hard to get rid of.   It was just an ignorance snowball effect...some critics were just feeding off of others and did not do their jobs.I tried my best.  C'mon, didn't these critics see BAD BOYS 2?!Gigli :  ** 1/2",

The plot was ridiculous. And the script was nothing but tangent after tangent after tangent about baywatch and the vagina and Ben Affleck being a queer.

Ben Affleck is totally wrong for his role, unless he is trying to portray a slimeball so disgusting that the audience feels soiled. J-Lo does have a few passable moments but is certainly at her worst. Appearances by Al Pacino and Christopher Walken don't save it at all. The plot really isn't worth talking about, save to say that it may have been a Woody Allen reject from which any and all comedy was sucked out. One scene does deserve mention: the scene in which a character (J-Lo's character's ex) slits her wrists. Viewers should not get any ideas from this on how to make it stop. Use the remote control and eject the cassette or DVD! It makes me wonder how this movie is as low as it is on IMDb's Bottom 100 behind movies like Glitter, which at least has an excuse that some of the principals were not actors.",

Anyway, Larry \"Rhymes with Really\" Gigli (Ben Affleck) is a wannabe mobster who is assigned to kidnap Brian (Justin Bartha), the federal prosecutor's mentally handicapped brother. Because Larry is such a wet sandwich gangster, he gets a surprise visit from Ricki (Jennifer Lopez) whom he resents at first, but, of course, they end up in the sack together. Things get ugly when Starkman (Al Pacino) arrives, kills Louis (Lenny Venito), and tells Larry what an embarrassment he is, but Larry and Ricki quit and take Brian to \"the Baywatch\". Gigli is one of the most oddly-concocted films I have seen, with an ill-conceived story, bizarre subplots, and performances so off-collar that the actors look confused at what's going on. Ben Affleck seems more focused on acting like an egocentric douchebag than a lesser mob man and J-Lo, despite playing a badass bodyguard, comes off as just a special needs caretaker with a hot bod. Pacino is even worse, overacting in every sentence and emphasizing every four-letter word. However, Gigli's saving grace is Justin Bartha as Brian, who is desperate to lose his virginity yet has to take abuse from Larry in almost every scene. Another special shout-out goes to Christopher Walken and his awkwardly hilarious switch from a serious interrogation to a 20-second monologue about pie. Gigli is such an odd egg to sit through and is one of the classic examples of a bad romantic comedy. (1 Marie Calendar Pie a la Mode out of 5) (It's turkey time\u2026 Gobble gobble.)",

Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck lack chemistry which does not make sense because they were romantically involved outside of the film. Jennifer Lopez does actually do a decent performance and makes it somewhat entertaining and I did enjoy seeing her talk to Ben Affleck like he was dumb throughout the film and it was fun seeing her defend Justin Bartha's character. Ben Affleck's performance is quite annoying and tries too hard to look and sound tough but instead he puts a bad impression of what he thinks gangsters in films act like and he tends to overact a lot and throws the f bomb around more than Joe Pesci did in Casino. Justin Bartha did decent in his role and did try his best to act like an autistic person and he was clearly inspired by Dustin Hoffman's role from Rain Man. Throughout the film Justin Bartha wants to go to the Baywatch which makes me wonder how long ago this was written because Baywatch was off the air for 2 years when this was made.  There is a few entertaining elements here such as Jennifer Lopez giving teenagers a lecture at a restaurant and Ben Affleck breaking their computer at the end of the scene or when Ben Affleck tells Justin Bartha the Baywatch is closed with a pretend phone call. I also enjoyed seeing Justin Bartha sing Baby Got Back. It is not a great comedy but it's not as painful as other comedies such as The Master of Disguise, Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2, and Dumb and Dumber To. I would not put it up as one of the worst movies ever made either because there is much worse like Battlefield Earth and Son of the Mask and I definitely don't think Martin Brest should have quit directing movies after this because he just hit a speed bump and I am sure he could have bounced back after this if he wanted to.

Gigli isn't even the worst film of the summer, and won't come close to the year's Bottom 10 list. I'm not going to defend the movie. I don't recommend it and, for the most part, it's an example of inept filmmaking, but it is watchable. I have to wonder if those who are coming down so hard on the motion picture have a secondary agenda. Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez are adequate- not Bogart/Hepburn but not too terrible either.

It's actually a black comedy with a premise that's a crossover between crime movies and Chasing Amy. Al Pacino and Christopher Walken provide the best scenes in the entire movie but this movie feels inconsistent. This is because the movie was meant to be a 160-minute-long darker, less \"romantic\" crime story with more violence than that admittedly brutal headshot and Walken would've killed Affleck at the end. But instead, Hollywood decided to cash in on Bennifer resulting in multiple rewrites. I can't say this movie is so bad it's good like The Room because I was mostly bored. I think this is one of the VERY few movies in which actors who are dating in real life lack chemistry in the movie that's meant to be about them falling in love. Mild spoiler: Gigli, rhymes with really, magically cures Lopez's lesbianism later in the movie in no time flat. At least, there was a better sense of realism regarding a lesbian dating a guy in Chasing Amy thanks to Kevin Smith's smart script. It's utterly offensive in its portrayal of mentally handicapped people as the National Treasure kid is told by Gigli to \"act normal\" even though he can't because of his \"psychological defects\" as his boss, I think, puts it. What's with his obsession with Baywatch, though? Most of the actors outside of Bennifer are one-scene wonders. They do one scene, earn their paycheck and get high. Do you want to watch a nice romantic comedy that has Ben Affleck and LGBT themes? Go watch Chasing Amy. Do you want to watch a movie about crime that involves kidnapping a prosecutor's mentally challenged brother easily? Then I'm sorry, because whichever way you view this movie, you lose either way. Bennifer had better chemistry than Bennifer. Did you get it? Because he began dating that other Jennifer during Daredevil? I'm terrible at these wit games.",

The problem however, the boss thinks that Gigli would screw up, so be brings in another mobster to either support him for the task, or do it for him. I have heard so much about this film being one of the worst films of all time, and when I saw it on DirecTV, I was very curious about it and even though it's not one of the worst films that I've seen, Gigli is still a very awful film that I honestly can't believe that I was watching it. This movie was around the time that Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck were dating, and since the movie has both of them in one film, the studio wanted the film to be a romantic comedy as Martin Brest's intention was to make a dark comedy mob film. Let's get to the positive because there are a few that I can think of. The acting is not bad, Christopher Walken is one of the funniest parts in the film, which he's only in it for a few minutes, and Al Pacino is having a lot of fun in this which I feel like he's in a completely different movie. I like the idea of one of the main characters being a lesbian as you don't see that often in films, especially the mainstream ones, but that's all I can think of sadly. The chemistry between the main characters feel a bit forced that you already know what's going to happen to them two. The writing isn't really good as there are some laughable lines that are not to be taken seriously, and there's a lot of plot lines that don't add up at all. It's not really that funny, nor interesting to watch as there's nothing much going on. The characters are bland, and it's not inspiring to watch. Gigli is a dull film that I'm glad that I got to see it just to see how bad it is, and while isn't there as my worst films, I still didn't like what I was watching.",

She calls it feeding her to wolves, when her mom abandoned her on a NYC subway pushing her to go to casting calls. She admits that Hollywood has burned out her spirit. \n\nShe admits she was raped by James Woods, over and over, in an abusive relationship that soiled her innocence. Jim was older than Missy's father at the time, and chewed Missy and spit her out when Missy couldn't control her mouth. \n\nMissy claims to follow Marianne Williamson, where Maryanne teaches that \"relationships are laboratories for the holy spirit\" but Missy can't hold a relationship since she often switches to a bipolar state of a ranting lunatic. \n\nMissy, tries to lift herself up by talking down to people, and yet she  \n\n\tFailed at being an actress, staring in a movie called Seclusion, which got a 0% Rotten Tomatoes score and has been reviewed as \"simply terrible\" as well as Gigli, which bombed, and received a Rotten Tomatoes Critic Score of 6% and a Flixster User Score of 13% That means 97% of critics hated it, and 87% of real movie goers thought it was absolutely terrible.  \n\tFailed at running a bed and breakfast, \n\tFailed at being a waitress and was fired in her 1st month at the The Outback, as she could not properly \"sling steaks\" to Outback's customers. To verify, call the general manager, Outback Steakhouse, 988 W Dillon Rd Louisville, CO 80027\n\tFails at staying of pain meds, she is almost always high, especially at night, when she morphs into her angry persona.\n\tFails at staying off the alcohol and continually falls off the wagon with a few bottles of wine a night.\n\nHer dog named Jackson is the only thing that can give her unconditional love, considering her psychotic behavior and has no idea her breasts shriveled up from her nervous chain smoking. \n\nShe shuns her two housemates, Paul and Jeff, and secretly eats their food in the fridge, and makes fun of the fact that they split the fridge in half with their own sides. \n\nIn shows like Law and Order, she has been cast as an ANGRY person, spot on with reality. Too bad there is no need for her to do a \"mommy dearest\" sequel. \n\nMy friend tried to find her a psychologist to help her work out her anger issues with her mom throwing her to the wolves at age 12 - something she hates her mom for and allows herself to foster rage vs love. \n\nJames Woods dumped her when she cursed him out the day his mom died. He promised never to speak to her ever again, and has held true to his promise. \n\nMissy has been trying to get a degree online at Argosy University, but has had to drop a psychology class because the professor said she was \"crazy\". The class was PSY301 Children and Violence. I think the professor saw violent qualities in Missy and could not get through to her.  \n\nLastly, Melissa looks up to acts of suicide as something \"courageous\" and looks up to what Robin Williams did. Terrible. Life is something to be enjoyed, shared with others, and spread the love. She somehow thinks there is some dignity in taking your own life and having your loved ones suffer.\n\nSomeone, please reach out to her and help her as she is spiraling downward.",

You'll join the legions of people who believe this to be an affront on film making but, if you choose to trust your baser instincts, your last thoughts as a live human being will be \"that one... that one we got wrong.\"\nThe director/writer, Martin Brest, casts the conventions of film making into a lake of fire. The lynch-pins of the Hollywood troglodytes are obliterated. The trusted lexicons of all trusted purveyors of film, in their many forms, are stricken from this dimension altogether. This film personifies creativity more than anyone before or since. \nGigli is not your garden variety hit man. He's a sensitive guy who;s more-or-less forced into his profession. Ben Affleck, who preforms astonishingly well in this timeless classic, plays a bad actor. That is who Gigli is. He needs the intimidation factor to do hid dirty deeds, and it takes the wise eyes of Jennifer Lopez to see through this facade.\nThe plot casually progresses as if it were a breezy Sunday afternoon. The chemistry between Affleck and Lopez simmers and cools until its utterly enjoyable crescendo at the end. Even if you can't stand this movie, the end is guaranteed to bring the warm tears of joy to your eyes.\n Obviously this a film that should be handled with caution.

I saw it in theaters, I bought it and have watched it a number of times since.  Is it the best movie ever made?  Certainly not, but it is so far from the worst ever made and if you actually look at the box office debut and numbers, far worse bombs invaded the box office before and have since.  Jennifer Lopez gives an incredibly believable and nuanced performance as Ricki.  She's directed very well and her character is crafted.  Nice job!  Al Pacino and Christopher Walken are crazily wonderful in their cameos.  And while the story isn't ground breaking, I give it credit for originality.  It's not another superhero movie or franchise which Hollywood has been obsessed with churning out for years now.  It's entertaining and funny.  Haters are going to find hate because they're too lazy to form their own opinions.  Bottom line: the film is overly criticized because of their very public relationship but so far away from the bottom of the barrel that people are so keen to place it in.

It's that bad. I don't know where you can start with this.\n\nThe movie opens with Ben Affleck breaking fourth wall. He is monologuing about his life while staring directly into the camera. He is shaking down a business owner. Note: Ben Affleck is the most unbelievable mobster to have ever mobbed. He tries to have some kind of mob accent and have his bouffant hair but it just looks stupid. It would have been more believable if he went MORE over the top.\nHis boss is the second most unbelievable mobster to ever mobbed. There is some sort of plot where the big boss man (Al Pacino...? Yeah, Al Pacino) is being indicted on federal charges, so Ben Affleck has to kidnap the prosecutor's retarded brother. That is the plot. Ben Affleck, whom his boss has ZERO confidence in and says as much before ASSIGNING Affleck this task, has to kidnap a mentally handicapped person. No, I can't even say that, that would be rude to people with actual mental handicaps. This was a retarded person.\n\nSo Ben kidnaps retarded prosecutor's brother (Justin Bartha aka the guy from the Hangover who gets left on the roof for pretty much the whole movie) and hilarity fails to ensue. Ben Affleck is just mean to this kid. But then, Bartha does shit that would make me want to punch him in the face. Okay, he just randomly yells stuff. Okay, there are people who have tourettes and ticks. But then Bartha would say stupid shit like, \"girls make my penis sneeze.\" That was a line in the movie. What am I watching?! This was horribly offensive.\n\nSo Affleck kidnapped Bartha and they are just chilling in his apartment. Suddenly, this turns into some kind of babysitting movie. Then enters Lopez. She is apparently some kind of hired assassin hired by Affleck's boss to make sure Affleck doesn't fuck up the kidnapping. I'm sorry, if you didn't trust this guy, why wouldn't you just have Lopez kidnap the kid. Also, it's never explained what they had hoped to accomplish with kidnapping this retarded kid. Drop the case presumably? But the retarded brother lived in an adult home. His brother obviously didn't give that much of a shit about him. Also, Affleck has him for DAYS and nothing has happened so it was pretty much time to call this plan dead.\n\nBUT NO.\n\nSo Lopez is a verbose assassin. She just pontificates about her sexuality. You see, she's a lesbian. And she must tell Affleck, how much of a lesbian she is. Because that's what lesbians ALWAYS do. Oh vagina this, and scissoring that. Lez Lez Lez. Damn lesbians, cut it out with your hot make out parties and sexy pillow fights. Your lesbian pollen knows no bounds!\n\nFUCK.\n\nSo at this point, Christopher Walken waltzes into Affleck's room, apparently he's a prosecutor too. Affleck voluntarily lets him in. Walken walks around, alludes to the fact that he knows the Bartha is in the room, then has a stroke mid conversation, talks about Marie Callendar pies and how if you put that pie on your head, you'd eat your nose trying to get to it. SOUND TASTY? HUH?! This is legitimately what happened. Then he left. He didn't show up the rest of the movie.\n\nSo Affleck has to keep Bartha occupied for fucking infinity while this plan unfolds. Bartha just wants to see Baywatch, because you know, he only understands boobs or something. Affleck lies to this kid like umpteenth times about taking him to see Baywatch just so Affleck could do random errands. This was like 40 minutes of the movie. Just dragging this kid around.\n\nThen there's one point where Affleck's boss tells Affleck to cut Bartha's thumbs off and send them to the prosecutor. You know, reasonable plan. Affleck's heart suddenly grows three sizes and says he can't do it. And Lopez, that lezbo assassin with the heart of coal, also doesn't want to do it. So they....don't do it. For a long time. No consequences. This kind of just keeps going on.\n\nDuring one of these no point scenes, which was pretty much everyone of them, Lopez starts pontificating about how amazing it is when a chick eats her out. Yup. And Affleck stares at her like she was a rack of ribs and he hadn't eaten since Chasing Amy. She ends her lezbo rant with saying how she would never let a dude eat her out. Then says she's gonna let Affleck eat her out. She punctuates sexy time with spreading her legs and saying, \"It's Turkey Time. Gobble Gobble\"\n\nThat is where I turned off the movie.\n\nSo a couple of months later, I watched the rest. It's more of the same. It's two awful people being awful to an awful actor trying to portray someone with a real handicap and somehow, they are trying to garner sympathy as people put in a precarious position.\n\nThey just fuck around some more until AL PACINO shows up. AL Pacino meets with Affleck's boss, Affleck, and Lopez. Al Pacino looks disheveled but that's just his normal garb. Basically he goes on a rant about how stupid it was to kidnap the prosecutor's retarded brother and how they are idiots. He kills Affleck's boss in a move everyone wanted to happen 10 seconds into the film. Al Pacino was the real hero in the film.\n\nThen Pacino lets them go to...I guess return Bartha? I'm not quite sure. So now it's this sad time, because these two awful characters had grown such a meaningful fucking relationship with their kidnapee. Finally, Affleck takes Bartha to see Baywatch. They are filming on the beach, Affleck drops him off and then GIVES HIS CAR TO LOPEZ. Not like, hey you can borrow it, but YOU CAN HAVE IT, I KNOW YOU MUST LEAVE ME NOW AND I'M OKAY. So Lopez, being the bitch she is, actually takes the car and leaves. Bartha dances .... like a retard with big breasted women. When you see it, you'd agree it was retarded. There is Affleck, looking like a fucking tool, being smug and probably thinking, \"I'm an amazing guy.\"\n\nThen Lopez comes back. She was supposed to drive into the sunset, because her...identity was compromised...or it just wouldn't work out because she's a lez and he's an unattractive lez or something. Who knows anymore. So she comes back around. Affleck, with a straight face, asks if he can get a ride. Yo, dumbass, THAT'S YOUR CAR.\nShe is bitchy about it and then lets him in and they drive into the sunset together. Actual ending of this movie. I omitted a part where Affleck cries at one point because he really wanted to bang Lopez but he couldn't because she wouldn't let him. So we are supposed to root for the guy that cried because he wanted to fuck Lopez and she said no. What a hero.\n\nThis movie fucking sucked. It is inexplicably bad. These are people who should know something about movies. This is worse than any other bad movie. At least Troll 2, it is funny and maybe you can blame some aspects of the film on language difficulty. At least a movie as bad as Troll 2 doesn't have someone offensively portraying a kid with a mental handicap.\n\nNo one should let Affleck live this down. I hope the Joker in the new Batman movie tells Affleck, \"it's turkey time, gobble gobble\" and then just shoots him dead.",

            "content": "Gigli is one of those rare films that always end up on everyone's worst lists. After watching it, I understand why.\n\nLarry Gigli (Ben Affleck), a lowly hit man in Los Angeles, who is looking to finally score big, lands the perfect \"job\"--or so he thinks. He is assigned to kidnap Brian, the psychologically challenged younger brother of a powerful federal prosecutor, in order to save his mobster boss from incarceration. Holed-up in his one-bedroom apartment with his kidnap victim Brian, Gigli starts to realize that what he thought would be a routine assignment has become a daunting and unwieldy task. Ricki (Jennifer Lopez), a beautiful, independent-minded female gangster, is sent to assist Gigli with the kidnapping--as his boss doesn't have faith that Gigli can carry out the job on his own. But when his feelings for the elusive Ricki begin to grow, and he becomes genuinely concerned for the vulnerable Brian (Justin Bartha), tough guy Gigli begins to trade in his tough exterior, for a more human, sensitive one--and considering his profession, that could be quite a dangerous path to follow.\n\nThere is nothing to say about Gigli (although it is). It is not the worst film ever made. However, it is one of the worst. Since the Bennifer accident, everyone has been bashing the film. After watching the film, it is well deserved. Why? Because in this film, Bennifer have no chemistry with each other. When you have a couple in your film, they suppose to have chemistry. But hey, that is just me.\n\nIt is shocking that great talents like Al Pacino and Christopher Walken would sign up to such crap. Are they in this film just for a paycheck or what? Um... I guess so. I mean I don't know to be honest. It is a good thing that everyone's careers (except for Lopez) went somewhat up from here.\n\nI have nothing else to say about Gigli (although it is very little). Gigli is a clumsy trainwreck from beginning to end. There is nothing positive to say about it. It is such a bizarre (not in a good way) mess of a movie that I being to question why it was made, why did I watch it, and why talented actors wanted to sign up to be in it. I would say it must be seen to be believe but it is not worth your time or money (if it is on Blu-Ray or DVD). Even as a bad movie fan, you should avoid Gigli like the plaque.",

A mentally retarded man with a heart of gold. Now come on, I'm all for the Hollywood \"hooker with a heart of gold\" tale, but \"Gigli\" is just ridiculous. These two hours of raw sewage were directed by Martin Brest, who had a Best Director Oscar nomination under his belt before taking on the Herculean task of trying to form a celluloid entertainment centered on Ben & JLo. Poor Martin. Thank Christ that Ben & JLo broke up, which guarantees no \"Gigli\" sequel. Of course the fact that it cost $54 million to make (half in salaries to the gruesome twosome) and had a WORLDWIDE gross of $5.6 million probably greatly reduces the odds of a \"Gigli\" sequel, as well. I would prefer Hollywood give $53.9 million to kids dying of cancer or disabled vets and then spend the other $100,000 on a \"Girls Gone Wild\" film set in San Quentin. Now THAT'S entertainment.",

Gigli tries to be a smart comedy-crime movie, instead it has no comedy nor crime, its just a boring 2 hour movie with nothing interesting in it and goes to new lows on the two genre's. Now, the performers: Ben Affleck is supposed to play this smooth and charming hit-man...instead he plays an absolute d***, who is angry with poor Justin Bartha who has mental problems, screaming and shouting at him, and thinking he's the boss. Affleck is unappealing, uninteresting and just dumb, never thought he was the leader in the movie, but good thing his career changed thanks to his other films and the ones his directing (Gone Baby Gone, The Town, Argo). Justin Bartha plays the mental person in this movie, and even though he sometimes is appealing, he also was annoying and loud, but at least you kinda feel bad for his character who has those problems, so he was a so-so to me. The best performance in the movie (and probably the only thing good in the movie) was Jennifer Lopez, she was cute, charming, appealing, sexy and she looked like the leader in the movie more the Affleck. Still, she has that line in the movie...\"It's turkey time..gobble gobble\"...it leaves you saying \"...what?\", so yeah it was nice to know that the female lead wasn't terrible, she was better than I thought. However, the messy and terrible script can't save Lopez's exceptional acting, making her look worse with Affleck and anybody involved in this movie. Also, Affleck and Lopez have absolutely no chemistry, it looked force and they were at that time \"Bennifer\"...how can there chemistry fail? Makes you wonder why it failed. Then we go too the cameos of Christopher Walken who gave the most bizarre performance ever, everything he was saying didn't make any sense (again, terrible script) and Al Pacino who had no meaning whatsoever to be in the film, he was there to be.....there. In the end Gigli has no thrills, a few empty chuckles, a waste of talented actors, a messy script, lackluster chemistry between its leads, it's 2 hours of boringness and it never decides what it wants to be, worst movie of all time? not really but its the biggest train wreck of a movie I have ever seen.",

Al Pacino is equally unbearable as the obnoxious criminal who is setting all this up to avoid prison time.

Audiences wanted to see their favorite couple in the greatest romantic comedy of all time but instead they got a meaningless, meandering, overly talky gangster picture that tries desperately to be a new age romantic comedy. \"Gigli\" has very few bright spots and I mean that in all honesty. Jennifer Lopez is the main reason to see the film (if that is much of one at all). Her resume is weak to say the least with only two or three credible performances to speak of- \"Gigli\" is surprisingly one of them. Her approach to the film is serious but with just enough of a 'wink, wink, nudge, nudge' carelessness to make it credible. She also handles her monologues quite well, something Ben Affleck crashes and burns with at every chance.  Christopher Walken and Al Pacino also add a few points as well and like Lopez, do well with their dialogue. But in the end, \"Gigli\" is just plain bizarre. It has no idea what it wants to be (a romantic comedy, a mob picture), what it wants to say (about people leading violent lives, about sexual ambiguity, about the politics of crime) or what it wants to make you feel and worst of all, it's just plain boring most of the time.",

This was already explored, really really well, in \"Chasing Amy\", why try to swing for that ball again when you can miss as miserably as this film does?  There are a few moments where the film looks like it has potential, which is why I didn't give it the lowest rating;  Christopher Walkens cameo starts off as a solid piece of acting, until a bit about Marie Calendar sends it over the edge and his entire scene quickly loses its traction.  There are some choice comical moments in the Al Pacino scene and at select moments.  But most of the characters in the film don't seem to have any purpose that stays consistent or doesn't constantly attempt to change whatever identity is being established with the characters.  Still I will give this dumb piece of filmmaking this much credit:  I can see where it seemed like it was going in a direction of quality and then immediately ran away from it.  And awful as a result of misguidance?  Not better by much, but still slightly better than your run of the mill awful.",

I have a theory on this scene though. I think Christopher Walken realized how aweful this movie is so while acting in this scene, he gets side out of focus and starts thinking about a pie he will eat on his lunch break.  That's my theory because that line seems so improvised that it couldn't have been in the script. Hell even the actors look confused after the line is said.  I guess the director was just ok with it.  That being said, this movie is pure awfulness. Just search the pie scene on YouTube it's not worth watching this movie for one scene.",

This film has left a permanent scar in my memory, and I will forever have lines such as \"It's turkey time. Gobble, gobble,\" and \"the mouth is the twin sister of the vagina\" engraved in my memory. By the time I finished watching this film, I had died a little on the inside. It may have only been a small part of my soul, but that small part died in excruciating agony having to deal with watching this unholy abomination called Gigli (And no, I am not exaggerating. The film literally killed part of me). Don't believe anyone who says that it isn't as bad you've heard, because in reality, it is that bad. In fact, it was worse than I had anticipated! If you value your sanity and enjoy comedies that are actually good, never watch Gigli or it will permanently scar you for life. FUCK GIGLI!!!!",

It's almost as if he gave up and wanted to further cement the film's status as one of the worst films to come out of the Hollywood system in the decade.\r\n\r\nEven bad movie aficionados will have a hard time sitting through this.

Jennifer Lopez is the main reason to see the film (if that is much of one at all). Her resume is weak to say the least with only two or three credible performances to speak of- \"Gigli\" is surprisingly one of them. Her approach to the film is serious but with just enough of a 'wink, wink, nudge, nudge' carelessness to make it credible. She also handles her monologues quite well, something Ben Affleck crashes and burns with at every chance.  Christopher Walken and Al Pacino also add a few points as well and like Lopez, do well with their dialogue. But in the end, \"Gigli\" is just plain bizarre. It has no idea what it wants to be (a romantic comedy, a mob picture), what it wants to say (about people leading violent lives, about sexual ambiguity, about the politics of crime) or what it wants to make you feel and worst of all, it's just plain boring most of the time.",

            "content": "When Conan O'Brien just has to say the name of your movie to get a big laugh in his opening monologue every night for two months, you know you've screwed up. It was for that exact reason that I set out to watch this flop for the first time since it came out, ten long years ago, and it was so much worse than I could have expected. Usually films that are bad, and feature big stars, at least have a gimmick, maybe some off-color jokes, or have a bloated budget, but there's no reason for this unmitigated tripe. There is no budget, the script is atrocious, and the characters are either one sided, conceited, or plain dumb. The premise alone is staggeringly awful: a very low level mobster (Ben Affleck a gangster? Really?) has to kidnap the brother of a federal prosecutor, who happens to be mentally challenged. That alone should stop you if you are reading the script. He does so with minimal effort, which is strange, because you would think there would be a lot of security for someone so vulnerable. Then waltzes in the other lead, Jennifer Lopez, as a hired gun, who happens to be a lesbian. I will say that at least they represent her as someone who deals with the traps and tribulations of relationships and comes out the other side the same as any hetero, when speaking about her relationship with another woman. Still, her sexuality, which is dealt with right off the bat, is pivoted once she starts hanging around Affleck's character. The mentally challenged character is also handled poorly, as he oftentimes rings his hands wildly and asks to go meet girls at the \"Baywatch\" time and again. Justin Bartha is in this role, and it baffles me that it doesn't follow him around the same way the others have suffered for this flop. There are some brief cameos from Christopher Walken and Al Pacino that are twenty times more entertaining, but most of this film concerns this strange love story between the goon and the lesbian. They barely leave the apartment, talk to anyone, or do much of anything (if cutting a dead guy's thumb off doesn't count). Most of that doesn't even matter, because the background score for this film is so loud and obnoxious you can't hear the actor's voices over it, which makes this feel as cheap and sleazy as the rest of the movie. It's so pathetically contrived and icky at all times, and not one person can justify to me why this film needed to be made.",

Sitting through Gigli is an endurance test-- this is a catastrophe of immeasurable proportions, blessed with one of the worst screenplays ever produced by a major studio and released over 2,000 screens across America. Martin Brest's film tries to dodge conventions and be 'edgy' material, but it absolutely does not have the brain cells to even function as a movie of its own. We are given no sense of character to these type-A bad screenwriter offsprings, and the 'plot' they swim in is simply non-existent. There is no drive, no conflict, no momentum to Gigli-- just an endless, slackly-edited run of the most horrific hard-boiled dialogue imaginable. Marred by a broadly uncharismatic lead turn by Ben Affleck and a deeply unconvincing Jennifer Lopez posing as a lesbian female gangster, Gigli may not be one of the worst movies of all time, but fuck it-- it is, for my money, one of the worst film viewing experiences of all time.

This is probably the only stereotype I agree with in the movie, even if they did exaggerate it a lot. Needless to say this movie answers those questions with an  exaggerated answer, but its a true answer. On both sides. This movie was suppose to be a comedy right? Cause if not, it came out that way, and there are many types of comedy, the laugh till you can't breath ones (which are beyond rare and few), the really bad attempt ones (like a majority of the ones with the Rock in it), and even ones like this (an almost cartoon quality to real life, for the sake of not using that \"E\" word again) I liked it a lot, but it only makes it on to my favorites for the \"lips\" speech Jennifer gives to Ben.",

Affleck, who has since redeemed himself, is just absolutely horrid in this film and it is beyond me how the director did not see this.  Lopez, as a tough girl, is laughable at best.  The one redeeming feature of this film is the cliche-ridden, yet well played Brian, played by the now-stufly Justin Bartha.  It is a shame his first starring role is of a stereotypical mentally challenged man, but with the role he got, he did make the best of it...leading to great roles in TV's \"Teachers\" and most recently in 2009's sleeper hit, \"The Hangover.\"\r\n\r\nNo matter how curious you may be, take it from me and everyone else who has seen this film and has taste...don't waste your time...and moreso, don't waste any money!",

Affleck's over the top Brooklyn tough guy was painful. Lopez is the same in every movie so don't expect much.

I started watching this movie with certain prejudice. I figured it might suck so bad that it turns funny. It didn't do that to me. I do have to admit that B Afl sucked big time when he was trying to be a bad ass. Other than that, this was just a movie which you can just as well watch and not suffer bad. There is this dialogue in this movie, which I take tries to imitate that of Tarantino, but it fails in that. Most all imitations are doomed to do that. Yet, I kinda enjoyed it. It brought back memories to me from when I was adolescent and tackled with issues and philosophies the main characters do. And those issues pretty much include sex and being cool. For a non-native English speaker the dialogue was just dandy lesson of how to deliver an issue in an elegant manner. I do doubt, however, that crooks really use language like that which makes it kinda unnatural. It seems to me also that it is unnatural, or at least not so easy, to turn a lesbian (J Lo's character) into straight. Or maybe that way, but not the other way around. Christopher Walken has a small role in the beginning of the movie and, much to my surprise, he is all grey. His eyes, his hair, and his outfit. Al Pacino was also lured to this flick. His role isn't much of a role. But I didn't expect much anything else. He lost his talent after Godfather movies. His talent deflated in a direct proportion to his ego inflating. The retard in the movie, he resembles Christopher Meloni. That's pretty much all I can say about the movie, because I missed the ending. I set my decoder to time it right, but maybe the programs were delayed, and my timer disconnected the recording before the movie ended. I probably missed about 10 minutes of the end. I bet there was a closure. I bet Walken was involved in it. I bet Pacino didn't walk out of the charges he was facing unharmed. I bet the retard reurned to the nursing home intact. And I believe that J Lo turned from a tuna turner to a straight chick, and those two lived happily ever after. Now  missed the ending. And I - this is no joke - would like to have seen it.",

J-Lo's acting in this film is the worst kind of tripe. She phones in her performance so much that the long-distance rates must be outrageous on her part. Al Pacino is equally unbearable as the obnoxious criminal who is setting all this up to avoid prison time.

Anatomically oriented without being funny, it meandres, going nowhere and doing nothing before mercifully ending after what seems like an eternity.\r\n\r\nThe two principals are also terrible.  Lopez has always been a terrible actress, and Ben Affleck, while a talented writer/director has an ecclectic mix of good to god awful performances under his belt (surviving christmas or pearl harbor anyone), and this is one of the off ones.  Walken shines, and Pacino is good, but they can't save this film from its seeming obsession with making mistake after mistake.\r\n\r\nAvoid like the plague.",

I really couldn't believe that the film had even gotten out of the cannister with acting that flat, which is something, given Ben Affleck's track record, not to mention the addition of such acting muscle as Al Pacino and Christopher Walken into the mix.  Moments that were supposed to be tender fell flat with music that tried to over-dramatize scenes whith which the actors clearly weren't connecting, and the script, full of missed connections and wanderings that made absolutely no sense to the audience, made it an amazingly good example of a film that should have never left the studio vault.

That's a sociopath...\n\nHaving seen my fair share of absolutely terrible movies, it says something when a movie is so abyssmal, so retched, so ungodly awful that it left me numb. I saw \"Pocket Ninjas\". I saw \"Dracula 3000\". I saw \"Ax 'Em\". I even sat through \"Torque\" ALONE, and none of these movies manage to fail on as many levels as Gigli. In spite of the fact that its plot involves mobsters, kidnapping, and appearances from Al Pacino and Christopher Walken, not only is the movie surprisingly boring but it somehow finds a way to be about absolutely NOTHING. If that weren't bad enough (and it is) the performances have all of the appeal of prison rape. Each of the central characters comes across as overwhelmingly unlikeable. They seem to talk at length about any number of subjects, but not to make a point of any kind. Instead they just enjoy hearing themselves talk, and YOU'RE gonna listen. From Affleck's \"bull/cow\" bullshit to Walken's cameo that is ultimately meaningless there isn't a single character whose company wouldn't make you want to drive their face through the nearest wall, and that's including Justin Bartha's character. He seems less like he has a mental handicap, and more like an asshole making fun of people with a mental handicap that just won't let the \"joke\" end. Look no further than his facial expressions when he's not speaking to solidify the case against this movie. You may have noticed that I haven't mentioned Jennifer Lopez...\n\nGigli is the kind of bad movie that you can't even have fun with easily. It's hard work and conditioning, and the reasons are obvious. The movie itself is like ball-cancer. I've never had it, I know, but could it really be much worse than watching this...?",
