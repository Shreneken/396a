It is so amazing that it has a lasting impression.Once again, Shah Rukh Khan steals the spotlight and does a magnificent performance as the beautiful and sweet Aman Mathur.By the way, i was thinking \"What a funny movie\" until the end...it just gets sad. And me being a really sensitive person, wow...it just blows you away. Shah Rukh Khan's brilliant performance will stay with you forever.I was up at 2.30 in the morning, tissues strewn all around me with tears just pouring down my face. The moment you try to stop crying, another scene comes on and you start again. Seriously, i'm really sensitive so no surprise but i reckon this film was the first film that actually made me cry that much. I just couldn't stop!! This is a must for everyone..including you sensitive people out there! Everyone must watch this film! It's just beautiful and it was actually an eye-opener for me! You've got to cherish whatever you have because who knows...tomorrow may never come.",

The plot somewhat predictable (and I better not to rehash it) but Nikil Adhvani as a director made it with a sense of love and that make this as a warm, subtle and deeply moving, a great entertainer indeed.The chemistry between Shahrukh, Preity Zinta and Saif-Ali Khan is so strong. What a fun-tastic acting fiesta. The songs are ear-catchy and added a plus point, not a waste like many Bollywood's movies. I know KHNH is a good movie when I first read the premise, but I don't realize that this is a very good movie. Just can't believe that this is Nikil Adhvani directorial debut.  Okay, enough comment, just watch it and experience the wonderful journey of life and LOVE.10/10",

Don't bother watching it if you hate sensitive films. Shahrukh, of course, is the show stealer.  Nobody can ever replace this brilliant star who can transform perfectly into his character.  Saif , the underestimated star, is great with comic timing as he was in Dil Chahta Hai, Na Tum Jaano Na Hum, etc.  Preity Zinta was good but wasn't as great as she was in Koi Mil Gaya.  Jaya has a nice role.  Songs are excellent and, in my opinion, the best soundtrack of the year.  The portion of \"6 din, ladki in\" in the second half was a bit of a drag, however.  The best part of this movie, though, is its theme.  Carpe diem!  People are so concerned with their futures that they forget to live the present.  God only knows where we'll be tomorrow.  Enjoy today before it's too late.",

            "content": "Being one of the first person to watch Kal Ho Naa Ho in my group, I was constantly battered by the same questions: is it worth it? what would you compare it to? whats it about? etc.To answer these and other questions:Was it worth it: well depending on your perspective of what an entertaining movie should be like, then the answer would either be: 'yes definitely' or 'you will be mad to miss it'. It is so worth watching and with it Karan Johar has confirmed the he is indeed a milestone in Hindi Cinema history. The movie is definitely directed by a another (Nikhil Advani), but it is a Johar camp movie. With the Johar camp you associate a good story, good production, good songs and the 'King Khan'.What would you compare it to? Well to be honest .nothing. It has the originality of `Kuch Kuch', the splendour of `K3G' and the freshness of `Dil Chaata Hai'; but it cannot be compared to any of these or other movies. It is in a league of its own. The story may start as the run-of-the-mill hindi-cinema story, but just when we begin to get comfortable with it, it takes a turn down another path. Don't get me wrong, it is not a complex story at all - but it is unique and compelling.Would you watch it again? Well to be honest, I am writing this after having watched it a second time. What is so rare about this movie is that even the second time round I laughed at the jokes, tapped at the music and got emotional in the sad scenes.What's it about? Well it will not be fair to tell you about it, as it's an experience you should have first hand. But it has its plus points: the comedy is great (both in the gujju digs as well as the 'kantabein' scenes); the music grows on you (maahi ve being the best); the guest appearances of 'charmed' actresses; the acting - excellent all round from SRK to Zinta to Saif to Jaya; along with good direction and production. It also has its negative points - but then so do other movies and I would rather not get into those.It may not be the DDLJ or Lagaan of hindi cinema, but it's the best movie of the year and definitely a movie that will entertain me for years to come.",

            "review_title": "Warm, fuzzy and completely lovable",
            "content": "*Story*Naina Catherine Kapur (Preity Zinta) lives in New York with her half-Punjabi, half-Catholic family. Her life is burdened with financial problems, bickering among family members, and memories of a dead father. She is a almost always grumpy and cynical, finding nothing to smile about. The only part of her life she likes is her friend Rohit (Saif Ali Khan) who is a fellow student in an MBA program.Into this drab life of Naina's comes a waft of fresh air in the guise of Aman Mathur (Shah Rukh Khan). Aman, the eternal optimist is the anti-Naina. He invites himself into the homes and hearts of the residents of the cozy Indian neighborhood and eventually, into Naina's life as well. What they don't know is that Aman is harboring a painful secret.The rest of the movie is about Aman, Naina and Rohit finding love, hope, happiness and ultimately the joy of living.*Review*The feeling I had as I left the theater can be best described as the feel of a woolly blanket on a chilly night. The woolly blanket in this case was around my heart. Kal Ho Naa Ho is by no means perfect. It has its share of illogical moments and cliched scenes. But while watching Indian films, one must get over such hurdles to appreciate them. Or like Naina, we'll be left criticizing everything in sight and forgetting to enjoy the moment. Also we must remember that although its important for the film industry to grow and evolve, its equally as important not to lose what is inherently our Indian identity which is apparent in the songs and the emotional quotient of hindi movies.That said, for me Kal Ho Naa Ho will go down as one of my all time favorite movies. The performances were wonderful. Shah Rukh Khan gives another performance that will be remembered. He may not be the greatest actor who ever came out of Bombay, but he is one of the few who manages to create characters who seem so friendly and lovable, you would think of him as your own. No one else in the industry has this knack of creating an atmosphere of 'apnapan'. Preity Zinta as Naina is wonderful and a perfect choice for the role. I have no idea how Dharma productions even considered Kareena Kapoor for the role of Naina. Saif Ali Khan is also incredible. Rohit is very similar to Sameer in Dil Chahta Hai but with a lot more emotional depth. I don't care how many times Saif plays that character, I still love him for it and I don't think I'll ever tire of seeing it. Jaya Bachchan who plays Jenny, Naina's mother is incredible in this small role. This character is very real and you can really sympathize with her because of Mrs. Bachchan.\nI was very disappointed with the music when it was first released. But the songs grew on me after watching them on screen. The title song is especially good as are Pretty Woman and Mahi Ve. Kuch To Hua hai is also much better on screen. Cinematography is wonderful, another aspect that makes this movie magical. Direction by Nikhil Advani is surprising to say the least. He did an excellent job bringing the story to life. And I will look forward to his next movie. It must have been hard for Karan Johar to give away his story, but Nikhil justified Karan's confidence in him and possibly made a better film than Karan might have. One of the many things I loved about the movie was that it was quite funny. Even during the dramatic moments, I was either laughing or smiling. The screenplay and the dialogues were excellent. Nikhil Advani must have a real talent for comic scenes because they were terrific.And finally I'd like to commend Karan Johar for writing such a wonderful story with characters that are very down to earth and real. Even though I loved his previous films (Kuch Kuch Hota Hai & Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham), Kal Ho Naa Ho is definitely my favorite. I hope we get to experience many more of his wonderful stories that are hopefully made with SRK :) because they are the dream team. If I ever meet Karan Johar, I will shake his hand and give him a hug for creating such a heart warming film.",

            "content": "Well, it is always a bit difficult in Western countries to get to see Bollywood movies with English subtitles, and though I have made a bit of an effort to spot them in the last few years I wouldn't call myself a Bollywood expert - and of course I've grown up with Western rather than Indian aesthetic standards ingrained. Although as a fan of Baroque Opera, I don't really have much difficulty with the basic premises of the Bollywood style!Having said that, this was possibly the most interesting Bollywood movie I've seen to date - especially in its attempt to incorporate elements of Western pop culture, including several blatant references to American movies, from Grease and a spoofed James Bond to Brad Silberling's City of Angels, which evidently contributed a lot to the way Shahruk Khan's character is handled (including him starting to see things in black and white when he is near dying - that one goes back all the way to Wim Wenders!).The soundtrack is stunning, and again it's great to see the way the New York setting gives opportunity to mix in some Western elements in an intelligent way. The dance and song numbers are a true joy, and it doesn't hurt that they are better integrated into the plot than in most Indian movies I've seen.Shahruk Khan is nicely parodying himself - at least, I thought he was... maybe I'm wrong??? :-o - I also particularly enjoyed the running joke about Aman and Rohit being a homosexual couple - one could indeed ask oneself who is really in love with who here? And why exactly does Aman prefer to love vicariously rather than going for the girl himself? It's also perhaps significant that it is Rohit rather than Naina who stays with Aman to the last. I am sure the filmmakers are intelligent enough to be aware of these undercurrents, even if perhaps most audiences aren't!In any case, watching this movie (with a very sympathetic audience at a foreign film showcase here in Wellington, people who actually laughed in most of the *right* places!) was a pure joy and it makes me happy to see how Indian cinema is finally beginning to be perceived as a legitimate part of international film culture even by Western audiences, rather than just an exotic oddity - something that Chinese and Japanese movies, for instance, have already achieved to a much greater degree!And now I'm off to buy the soundtrack...",

The makers have ensured that they have greased the wheels properly before the turkey was served.Lets look at the few aspects of the movie::01. Story: Nothing new but well-presented. And obviously the \"Anand\" factor was a diversion. 02. Characters: All of them etched out well. Be it talented Jaya Bachchan, Sushma Seth, Lillette Dubey, Sweetu, Rajpal Yadav or the highlight Kantaben. Simone Singh was good as well - she attempts a bit of skin-show, desperately wanting to break-free from the Heena image.03. Comedy: Comedy tracks have been really worked upon. There are many pokings at Gujju's directly (the audience on both my sides appeared threatening!) - but in spite of that the G.U.J.J.U. song makes up for all the damage. Clever, very clever. Kantaben was good and so was Satish Shah (and his English). 04. Location: The movie is a proper New York Darshan bus. The trivial mistakes about jogging to Central Park from Queens can be easily overlooked in the age where the scripts have crater sized holes. 05. Music: S-E-L have given one of their best compositions to date. Be it the title song or Mahi Ve - all of them stay with you for a long time. My favourite is Its the time to disco, Vasundhara Das rocks (she bring out the voice of Nazia Hassan). 06. Lyrics: The title song is definitely Javed Akhtar caliber. For the rest he should give the credit to a pseudonym.07. Spl. Appearances: Sonali Bendre and Sanjay Kapoor have extended special appearances. And in blink-an-miss appearances by Kajol & Rani (lucky mascots of Karan Johar), Uday Chopra and Jugal Hansraj. 08. Protagonists: SRK plays his part extremely well in the author backed role as \"the good Samaritan\", however does succumb to a bit of his usual hamming. Saif proves yet again that he is a dependable actor and at times can steal the show right under the nose. His performance at the restaurant (proposing scene) is wonderful. Preity does full justice to her character (Kareena - sour grapes! sour grapes!).09. Tracks: In fact the movie is full of tracks but interesting ones. Be it Kantaben, Simone Singh, the wrong house, 7-day proposing, Sweetu, revamping of the restaurant or Gia's adoption track. The director has just done a good copy-paste of it.The makers have ensured that there is maximum utilisation of resources at all fronts. For a first-timer Nikhil Advani has done a commendable job, obviously under the baton of Karan Johar who ensured that Yash Johar films flag remains high and rising.Definitely worth a watch.... with family.PS: Its interesting to see that from time to time, SRK acknowledges Aamir Khan in his movies (here the Lagaan song and in K3G the Ghulam matchstick).",

            "review_title": "Good, though could have been better",
            "content": "When I first saw \"Kal Ho Naa Ho\", I was surprised by the extremely modern way that was used to illustrate the film. I liked to see the Indian actors walking the streets of New York, and having a seemingly ordinary life of American, or at least Indian-American people. As a comedy, it worked partially - the humour is very Indian and some attempts to Americanise it fell flat, while some jokes were quite poor anyway. Still, the film is a wonderful comedy/drama about NRIs, and is very special as such, because most non-Indian films about Indians in western countries are incredibly stereotypical, and here you see a feel-good, positive energy where characters of Indian ethnicity are for once not portrayed as walking clich\u00e9s.But it's the dichotomy between the film's two main parts which is really hard to connect with. The first part was very nice, funny and entertaining. I liked the characters of the hot-tempered and sensitive Naina (Zinta), her loyal friend Rohit (Saif), who is a cool guy with a gold heart, but not very confident. Jennifer is a weary working woman, while her mother in-law Lajjo is a typical Punjabi mother in-law. The film is interesting and flows well, and then suddenly from nowhere comes Aman (Shahrukh), a happy-go-lucky guy who seems to have no problems in life, but he does want to solve all the problems in Naina's family when he meets the rather complicated girl, whom he falls in love with at first sight. The character of Aman is a great creation, adding a lot of comedy and humour to the film. Aman tries to get close to her and then, when she finally understands she is in love with him, he rejects her! It is weird, but then we get the real secret disclosed. Aman knows he cannot be with Naina so he tries to serve as a matchmaker between Naina and... Rohit, who also fell in love with her! A typical \"Karan Johar love triangle\" indeed. But it is not, it is done in a very different and charming way.Up until that point I really enjoyed the film. The really big problem comes in the fourth quarter of the film: It is so, so slow! There comes the writer's insistence to make it into a bad, lengthy tearjerker, with the usual, overly cheesy elements of its sort, only that it's probably the longest sequence of its sort to have been made in a Hindi film. Anyway, the film is still a good product overall. The direction by Advani is very good. The music is out of this world and every song contributes to the film in its own way, the cinematography is terrific and the sound is superb (mainly because it's live sound).Shahrukh Khan is mostly terrific, and then quite bad. His comic timing is fantastic, but towards the second half he goes overboard and sadly so, because given the energetic character, he could have extended the light attitude into the other parts as well. Saif Ali Khan is the film's biggest surprise. After Dil Chahta Hai, he shines with a wonderfully understated, sensitive performance. Note the scene when Naina tells Rohit about loving Aman and his expressions. Despite the strong presence of these two leads, however, the film naturally belongs to Ms. Zinta, who delivers a highly convincing performance in the central character. It goes without saying that she is the best choice for this role, which really goes through many transformations throughout the story. Towards the end she really outdoes herself. Jaya Bachchan is natural, highly dignified and restrained. The supporting cast, though, is mostly loud, although most of them come with nice comic turns.There were undoubtedly too many emotions, but Kal Ho Naa Ho works wonderfully as Bollywood entertainment. It has a nice, quite innovative script in terms of writing style and the background of the characters. The makers paid attention to the American style and environment of the film, and I found the contradiction between the bright, free of worry New York and the tear-jerking proceedings of the story toward the end very interesting even if some of the drama could have been toned down.",

It seems like the only ones most Westerners have actually seen are the Panther Panchali films of the 1950's. Of course, they still release great ones today. This film was 187 minutes and just so happened to be the longest movie I have ever seen online! It was certainly worth it to see the whole thing, though. I heard that most movies in India are three hours long. I guess they just have longer attention spans than us! This actually seemed pretty long even by their standards.It was weird that this took place in New York City for such a completely Indian film. Of course \"Slumdog Millionaire\" did the opposite and it was technically a British movie. What I love about this film is how bright and colorful everything is. We get great dance numbers and just so much movement going on. It's hard to keep up with all these characters. They really do work hard to make them all unique. With a population as big as them, it's easy to get a lot of people! There was in fact an intermission albeit quite brief. The second half is when it really starts getting serious. I can understand how such a long film would change in tone so radically. Whatever nationality, you should watch this movie. ***1/2",

I know he is often said to be \"overacting\" but his portrayal of this character and the pain and sacrifices he went through really swept me up into an emotional state. There may be times when you are in the mood for a story about someone without the modern \"I,Me,Mine\" attitude, about someone who knows that the real meaning of love often carries with it the need for making sacrifices and may mean caring more about the other person's needs than your own.",

In the majority of his movies, even I (a die-hard) find that he over-acts, but in this movie, his is at the pinnacle of his craft. His control is admirable, and I fell in love with him all over again.  Saif Ali Khan, who started his career as a callow youngster shows that he has finally come of age, and his heartbreaking performance in this movie is astoundingly mature.Preity Zinta is wholly believable as the woman they both fall in love with-- I almost fell in love with her myself (except my heart belongs to SRK!!)The supporting cast, full of stars in their own right, gave exquisitely balanced performances, with not a gesture or moment of screen time wasted.Nikhil Advani, I salute you.  You have managed to create what I didn't think was possible in todays world-- a Bollywood film that makes you laugh, cry, feel sad and yet happy at the same time, and also doesn't make you ashamed to take your non-indian friends to.  The only other movie that has accomplished that recently was DDLJ (and even that had one scene too far).The songs, which were disappointing on first listen, fit into the film so well that I will cry every time I hear them.  They now make perfect sense (in the same way that the songs of KKHH also improved after watching the movie)The look of the film, the humour, the choreography, the set direction, the cinematography, the everything of this movie are outstanding.In years to come, I will watch this movie with my kids (I hope), and hope that they will learn what I have today-- that the Bollywood movie is not dead, indeed it is alive and kicking, and Kal Ho Naa Ho, this movie will be a perfect monument to 2003 Bollywood cinema.Anyone who doesn't like this movie must truly have a heart of stone.WOW",

            "content": "Despites of all denials from Karan Johar, the movie does have a quite a resemblance to Indian classic Anand. Srk playing Rajesh Khanna's role, Priety playing Amitabh Bachchan role, Saif Playing the lady who was the love interest of Bachchan. I repeat it has quite an resemblance. The Performances were great, maybe sharukh get the praises but I personally appreaciated 2 performances. One of Priety and Saif's. Saif is really funny, and the best thing about him is he doesn't overact to make people laugh. I am just wondering how long does he have to wait till people start giving him credit for what he deserves, Saif carries his role wonderfully. Priety is like Julia Roberts of Bollywood, Preety woman. She could act, she proves yet again that she is not just a cute girl with a dimple on her cheek. The highlight of the movie is the funny moments of the movie, and it is filled with them. Shahrukh was good, yet again but Saif is the surprise. The movie was specially interesting with glimpse of all the stars; Sonali Bendre and Sanjay Kapoor, Rani and Kajol, Uday Chopra, Farah Khan. The supporting cast was very good too. Jaya Bachchan proving as her husband Bachchan that despite of her she still one of the best actresses. Lillete Dubey is a M.I.LF. Rajpal Yadav should overtake Johnny Lever any time in Bollywood top comedian slot. Sushma Seth, Dara Singh, the eternal macho man. Reema is nice. Satish Shah and Katki Dave are delight to watch as Gujus. Harry Potter look alike kid and her baby sitter were cute and ofcourse THE KANTABEN, homophobic maid was very funny. It was nice entertainer, nice fun, more funny then emotional. 7/10",

Shah Rukh Khan's character (Aman) is largely inspired by Rajesh Khanna's happy-go-lucky charmer in Anand. But on the whole, Kal Ho Naa Ho is as different as they come. The film kicks off with Manhattan resident Naina Catherine Kapur (Preity Zinta) narrating the story of her life over her daily morning jog. Don't Miss! The characters in Naina's life are introduced with the same energy that Naina puts into her jog. There is her mom Jennifer (Jaya Bachchan in jeans), who shares a love-hate relationship with her mother-in-law Sushma Seth (at her loudest Punjabi best). Mommy runs a flop restaurant. Grandmother is a flop singer. Together they are chaos. Enough reason for Naina to turn into a boring, bespectacled spinster type who takes life too seriously. The only interesting person in Naina's life is buddy Rohit Patel (Saif Ali Khan). He is uncool with women but thinks he is cool. He is also a typical Gujarati, whose father (Satish Shah) runs a business called Dial A Dhokla. Enter funny guy Aman, who turns out to be the proverbial angel in Naina's life. He is Dale Carnegie-Jim Carrey-Richard Gere-Deepak Chopra all rolled into one. He zooms into Naina's neighbourhood singing Pretty woman and woos everyone in sight, including uppity Naina. Naina hates him at first sight, but can't help being overwhelmed by Aman's charm. Even Rohit takes tips from Aman on how to be cool and influence people. Life is a song and dance till the interval. And After that everything is mystery, lol what?This is indeed a breathtaking movie! Go and watch instead of watching silly bollywood movies!",

            "content": "Okay I will not give a summary of the film. Enough of that already. Straight to the point: Kal Ho Naa Ho is a fantastic film....definitely worth seeing, and worth seeing over again.Shah Rukh Khan does a great job...as usual. I guess nobody else does emotional scenes AND comedy as well as he does. Saif Ali Khan is great. Again as usual, since he plays that role in many of his films, but he holds the story together....!! And Preity...well, it's her year. She rules Bollywood this year. After Koi mil gaya, she comes back in KHNH, with a much stronger role, probably her strongest role since Kya Kehna....and she excels in it. Yes, why was Kareena Kapoor even considered for this role??? Jaya Bacchan is also worth a mention. Nobody else could have played this role. She is fantastic!!! The special appearances make the film...well...special!!!Some of us would go see any film for 5 seconds of Kajol....especially next to Shah Rukh!!! And all credits to Karan Johar and Nikhil Advani. To Karan for coming up with the film, trusting Nikhil and making it happen, and to Nikhil for a first-class job in his first direction... And the music is wonderful...Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy definitely establishing themselves further in Bollywoodland. And Farah Khan plays her usual magic with the choreography, especially for the song Kuch to Hua Hai, which will keep you giggling in your seat...Now the loopholes: Why do all Caucasian looking people in America speak Hindi (with an awful accent as well), especially when some of the Indians sometimes afford to speak English!!??!! Why could they not spend some more time and effort to make Shah Rukh mime his rap words well in the Pretty Woman song?? Why, when Saif and Preity find out about Shah Rukh, they both seem more worried about their love lives than their friend's....well...LIFE!!! Why did I leave the cinema feeling that if Shah Rukh was given a dialogue full of hope before then end of the film, I'd have felt better...coz surely that was the point of the film: hope. I felt that the last 20 minutes were not well-explored enough...and too sketchy. One second SRK and Preity love each other, and the next she's still getting married...Why are we not shown the process that goes in between. It would have been good, emotional, and more realistic...But maybe I'm just moaning about details. Maybe I am being a bit of a Naina Catherine Kapoor....So, I'll end on this note rather...Seen in the broader context of Indian Cinema, this film is a proper landmark....It's a perfect blend of the East and the West. After rather unsuccessful attempts at copying American Pie-style comedy in Indian films, SOMEBODY finally showed us what it takes to make a success of this kind: A modern comedy (hilarious jokes) with modern direction (cool style of story-telling, I thought) in a true Indian setting. Modern music, but perfectly blended with Indian melody and lyrics. This film will take Indian comedy to new heights. And takes the East-West blend to new heights. And it takes a great film to do that...And it will leave u, not just proud of being Indian, but of being a Western Indian. Perfect blend....",

All the actors give a very moving performance. This movie can make you laugh and cry all at the same time, and the storyline isn't the same old things you see in Bollywood films. The main reason I like this film is because it contains modern elements in it. Its set in NY, and its has Western culture blended into it also. Being a teenager living in the US, I personally enjoy being able to relate to the movies I watch and I don't really like movies that are too traditional. I think if you like modernized Hindi movies you'll love this movie. Even if you don't, its most definitely worth watching.",

Karan from the Johar family, son of producer Yash Johar then came up with Kuch Kuch Hota Hai the following year. And then the media-shy, reclusive Chopra Jr. came up with Mohabbatein in the millenium. The creative, sensitive Karan Johar then made Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gam in 2001. Yahsraj Films then started franchising their super-successful brand of cinema through different directors like Sanjay Gadhvi (who made Mere Yaar Ki Shaadi Hai) and Kunal Kohli (who made Mujhse Dosti Karoge) last year. And now, here come Dharma Productions with Kal Ho Naa Ho.\nNo, I am not trying to display my cinematic knowledge and nor am I writing a biography on the Chopra and Johar families - arguably the two most successful and popular film families and production houses in Bollywood today. The common link between all these films is that they total about Rs 200 crores ($40 million USD) spent on creating about 25 hours of pretension.And the latest in this brand of super-superficial and super-superfluous cinema is Karan Johar's - oops! Sorry, Nikhil Advani's Kal Ho Naa Ho. There is tremendous detail in creating new looks for the protagonists, great costumes, technical slickness in terms of photography and production design; the music and choreography are extremely elaborate; even the script is detailed and bound from start to finish.But the goal of the film is to entertain by poking fun at the obese, the Gujarati - and no, I am neither - the middle-aged single woman, the gay  ( or to be more politically incorrect homo), the american - and I am none of these either - Jaya Bachan, Sushma Seth and Satish Shah's intelligence, Preity Zinta , Saif and pretty much everything else that is not Shahrukh. The melodrama reeks of glycerine and manipulation, the romance is so plot-oriented and pre-meditated that it is totally devoid of any chemistry (except for that between Shahrukh and Saif - now there's a film!).\nKaran Johar and co. are extrememly talented, professional film-makers. But they fail to understand that cinema is a medium where the imagination is excited to translate that which is human, empathetic, universal, courageous, inspiring, etc on celluloid - and not merely a commercial venture.\nBut then why fix that which ain't broke. Six of the above eight films have gone on to become blockbusters. And in any case, if the Chopra-Johar brand of filmmaking fails to ring the cash registers in future, they can always use their business acumen and franchising abilities to open a chain of McShahrukh's. 5/10.",

            "content": "Har pal yaha, jeebhar jiyo, jo hai samaa...kal ho naa ho...It takes a special person to apreciate a great Bollywood movie.  There's the constant melodrama, the endless love triangles and dress changes, the randomly inserted songs and hammy dialogue...not to mention the age-old desire to be everything to every viewer. There are so many Hollywood-esque problems that threaten its quality, so many qualms that any self-respecting American critic would feel compelled to point out, that loving it seems like a chore.  If anybody can do so, however, it is an Indian.And I LOVE being an Indian.KAL HO NAA HO (\"Tomorrow May or May Not Come\") is the third film involving writer-director Karan Johar and Dharma Productions, an Indian film label that has become synonymous with box-office and critical gold.  Their first two productions, KUCH KUCH HOTA HAI and KABHI KHUSHI KABHIE GHAM were both , in their respective times, the most popular Hindi films of all time, and with good reason.  They were the ultimate crowd pleasers: a perfect mix of comedy and drama with compelling stories, masterful performances, catchy music, and impeccable direction.  They hit every emotional high and low possible in the typical Bollywood audience, and the end results were magnificent.  KAL HO NAA HO continues this tradition in grand style.Naina Catherine (Priety Zinta) is the eldest daughter of Jenny Kapoor (Jaya Bachchan) and a father whose suicide has wreaked havoc on the entire Kapoor family.  The constant bickering among the members of her household has transformed Naina into a pitiful bore who has \"forgotten\" how to smile. Her best friend is Rohit (Saif Ali Khan), a fellow MBA student who has seen Naina through all her troubles.  The two have never been more than just friends.Along comes Aman Mathur (Shah Rukh Khan), a charasmatic man who enters the Kapoors' home and changes their lives for the better, much to Naina's dismay.  Aman helps every member of the family with any problem and seems to have all the answers - he is perfect.  Aman eventually wins over Naina and changes her into a smiling young woman once again, but not before she begins to have feelings for him.  What's more, Rohit soon reveals that he loves Naina.Yet all is not as it seems.  There are secrets to be uncovered, pasts to be mended, and futures to be made, and what the trio find out may suprise them.This is, firstly, an immesnly pleasing film.  The first half jumps right into the act with some wonderfully comedic scenes showcasing the talent of all three leads and the flair of first-time director Nikhil Advani.  A particular scene involving a housemaid who suspects Aman and Rohit of being gay is among the most humorous Hindi film moments I've seen.  Karan Johar's fort\u00e9 with dialogue really shines here -everything is quick-witted and funny, yet never insulting to the intelligence (many Hindi films can be). We grow to love and care about these characters quickly, but thankfully characterization does not bog down the forward motion of the marrative. The first 90 minutes literally flies by.The most noticable aspect of KHNH is the tone the writer and director bring to the film: it's incredibly energetic and light, and takes chances with material that worked for me.  Many times, the characters seem to speak one-on-one with the camera in an interview style to convey personal feelings or thoughts, an interesting tactic.  There are other little touches: the \"Day 1\", \"Day 2\", etc. introductions stand out in particular (see the film to find out what I mean).  There is an incredible scope and vibrant feel to the movie, as in an Dharma production.The second half of the film gives all involved a chance to really shine. Once the twist is revealed, things take a downward turn and the climax begins. Much of the light tone from the first 90 minutes creeps its way into the second half at all the right moments, but there are some truly heart-wrenching scenes toward the end of the film. This is to be expected, but their impact is heightened by the skill of the filmmakers.  In most cases, Hindi films pile crying scenes on top of one another in the hope of eliciting some, if any, reponses from the audience, but KHNH succeeds due to solid characterization and wonderful performances.This is clearly Shah Rukh Khan's film, and he acts his heart out.  It's the same performance we've seen a million times from him, but his skills aren't broke so they don't need any tuning.  His screen prescence is unmatched in this industry, and he captivates you during both the comedic and emotional scenes.  This was a chance for him to paly a different type of character, and his natural charisma lends itself well to what the part requires. Priety Zinta finally steps into the limelight as Naina with a wonderful performance that reveals her true potential.  Watching her onscreen transformation is as unexpected as it is alluring.  Saif Ali Khan essentially echoes his character from DIL CHAHTA HAI, but the magic has not worn off.  He has a knack for playing the straight man with unfulfilled, and still unkonwn, desires.  Supporting performances are from the usual Johar suspects and are accordingly wonderful.Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy finally enter the Johar ring with this entry and certainly hold their own.  The title song is my choice for song of the year - a gently sung ballad about living life to the fullest, complimented by wonderful lyrics from Javed Akhtar and great singing by Sonu Nigam.  The other romantic song, \"Kuch To Hua Hai\" is a very contemporary song with an international flavor that manages to please with an unusual beat and interesting composition.  \"It's The Time To Disco\" is the loser of this disc, although its film picturization is likable enough, and the much hyped \"Pretty Woman\" (yes, based on the classic American song) is surprisingly upbeat and entertaining.  The obligatory BSMDGC (Big Set, Many Dancers, Good Choreography) dance number is \"Maahi Ve\", a very catchy tune that bears some resemblance to the hit \"Shava Shava\" from KABHI KHUSHI KABHIE GHAM.  Farah Khan's onscreen choreography for the song does not disappoint, and the art direction is simply marvelous.This film marks a new standard for Hindi film editing, and shows just how much Bollywood has learned from its L.A. counterpart.  We have quick cuts, new wipes, and even splitscreens...all used wisely and not for cheap effect. The editing really brings the first half of the film to life, giving every song a \"get up and dance\" feeling that never hurts.Above all, this is Nikhil Advani's film.  Remarkably, this novice helmer shows no signs of being a rookie.  In true Johar style, he handles all the film's emotional scenes, a perennial marker for directorial excellence, with confidence and talent.  Having served before as assistant director to Karan Johar and Aditya Chopra, Advani pulls out all the stops here, giving us epic, dramatic camera direction, eliciting great performances, and near-perfect pacing.Sure, a good 10 minutes shaved off the finished product would be in the film's favor, but it is a minor qubble in a sea of compliments.This is ultimately a story about hope and love - the hope to keep moving and beliving, the love to keep surviving.  It is a story about the choices we make for love and the effects those choices have on our loved ones.  It is about living life to the fullest and seizing the day, for Kal Ho Naa Ho?",

Although Nikhil Advani started off in the backseat, it looks like from now on his job is in the director's chair. With the support of Karan Johar and Papa Yash Johar, it's almost impossible to go wrong. With such blockbusters as Kuch Kuch Hota Hai and Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham to his name, Karan Johar is ready to add another feather to his cap with his beautiful and heartwarming Kal Ho Na Ho. Kal Ho Na Ho is directed by Karan Johar's associate director Nikhil Advani and produced by Karan Johar, who has also written the screenplay for the film. Nikhil Advani was Johar's close assistant in all his films including Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, K3G, and Aditya Chopra's Mohabbatein.. The main cast has Shah Rukh Khan, Preity Zinta, Saif Ali Khan and Jaya Bachchan in the lead, and a plethora of others, including Sonali Bendre, in support.Kal Ho Naa Ho takes place in Manhattan, New York, and is the story of three friends, Aman (Shah Rukh Khan), Rohit (Saif Ali Khan), and Naina (Preity Zinta), who travel on a journey that teaches them the true meaning of friendship. It teaches them to discover themselves, and to find the courage to live through times of happiness and times of sorrow. With the constant arguments and bickering in her semi-Punjabi/semi-Christian family, Naina, 23, is completely distraught by the conditions which surround her. In addition to this, she is bombarded with the responsibilities of taking care of her younger brother and sister, as well as helping her mother, Jennifer (Jaya Bachchan) handle the family's economical complications. Between all these burdens, Naina never has time for herself.As far as the technical performance of the film goes, it is almost impossible to create a more perfect film. The editing skills are extremely sound and the cinematography shows the viewers what a difference a few angle adjustments can do for a film. The overall effect of the film is merely jaw dropping, for a lack of a better term. To put all rumors to rest, Kal Ho Na Ho is NOT a copy of Hrikesh Mukherjee's 1970s classic, Anand. Although Nikhil and Karan have adopted a shade of the film, by no means is it a copy, and should be regarded as a purely original story, written by Karan himself.The greatest asset that Kal Ho Na Ho has is its cast. The magnitude of chemistry between Shah Rukh Khan, Preity Zinta, and Saif Ali Khan is mind blowing! Adding Jaya Bachchan to the mix creates for an even more awesome effect. It's safe to say that this is one of Shah Rukh Khan's best performances ever. He breathes so much life into his character, Aman, and literally has you feeling for him as if he was your very own. He puts on a mesmerizing performance and will definitely earn himself many awards.Shankar, Ehsaan, and Loy are a major part of this film as well. There music, which has been topping the charts ever since its release, brings a beautiful touch to the film. Their soft yet mellifluous melodies compliment the film wonderfully. To top it all off, Javed Akhtar's mastery of the language creates for some heart warming lyrics.",

Aman's love will never will lost from her heart. The movie did what it intended to do. I walked out feeling their emotions. Only if it had been a little more real and less dramatic, but guess melodrama comes in package with the Dharma Productions. Nonetheless a very finely made film. MUST WATCH.",

I wept like a small child and even felt compelled to write this review, my first.Kal Ho Naa Ho is really Shah Rukh at his finest. I notice that Kareena Kapoor was originally offered the role of Naina and I must say that I am glad she asked for too much money because Preity Zinta completely changed my impression of her with this film. She displayed much acting talent in a complex role and is no longer \"the annoying girl from the Liril ads\" to me.This is very much like an Indian remake of \"Autumn in New York\", though, and despite knowing this I was not prepared for the conclusion. If you just like singing, dancing and happy Bollywood I'm not sure this one is for you. But, if you are looking for a plot and character-driven Indian film, I completely recommend this one. Get a nice warm blanket and a box of tissues ready though.",

A movie without substance when it comes to script, acting, or the message it was trying to convey. SRK as usual resorts to over-acting during key scenes. He is at par with Govinda when it comes to acting. He is a self-appointed Badshah of Bollywood. Saif did a better job with limited opportunity he was given. Preeti was dull in the first half of the movie and too synthetic in the second half. The movie may be entertaining to millions who have been fed the same formula over and over again. I am tired of watching these utterly predictable melodramas from Bollywood. Is Bollywood void of thinking directors and writers or are they only concerned about commercial success??  3/10",

This actor is good in the parts where some exuberance and fastpace is needed but the problem I reckon is that his charm extends beyond the confines of the script where the producer and director give in to him because of his fame and following; that they modify the script tailoring to a typical SRK fare-the cast in point how many goodbye scenes do we need after he turns back to make the phone call. The ending should be near-when he collapses on the dance floor-the ending should be closer or more indirect instead we have to sit through his \"Filmfare award contestant performance\" routine as in \"Shakti\" where his fans feel they have gotten the money's worth and them we have an ending fit for the king- Badshah of overacting!.The problem with this actor is not that he is talented or can deliver but his total domination of the proccedings where the Script becomes anouther pawn in his chessboard.What if we had his charming short entry and we had his voice over for the rest of the movie?. Some of the jokes are off-colour and would be considered politically incorrect but only Johar's can get away with it. There is not much doubt left that Priety Zinta can act but she and SAK have a tough time contesting with an actor like SRK who hijacks the Show to the point where it becomes who can overact better.The Industry cant live with him or without him and this is not healthy relation. I am sure there is or there was an actor who could have played the Mathur charecter better than SRK but the Johar's are struck with him so much so we have to endure him. Of the supporting actors Jaya Bachchan and Lilette Dubey are clearly outstanding.For a change SEL, are making a dent in the mainstream music, till now I was not sure if they were musicians or plain synthesizers(Dil Chahta hai). Overhaul it is a good movie but if the industry has to move forwards it has to get rid of some dead weight.",

            "content": "'Kal Ho Na Ho' is a typical melodramatic ugly duckling love story wannabe mixed with Hrishikesh Mukerhjee's masterpiece 'Anand'. The movie could've been so much better if the script was more compact, consistent, subtle and concise. There is are just too many problems with the writing. For example, -The whole adoption subplot with Jiah and the grandmother suddenly accepting her only because the girl turns out to be her biological granddaughter. So it's okay to accept her now since she's your own blood? What was Advani trying to prove with this silly point? That adopted children should be unacceptable? -The whole subplot with the grandmother (again) and her irritating friends. Actually a lot of the humour that did not involve Saif Ali Khan, Shahrukh Khan and Lilette Dubey fall flat. -The whole renovating the family restaurant sequence. What was with all that talking so rudely about the Chinese rival when all they did was respond friendly? This used to be the case in many Hindi films where non-Indians were portrayed in a negative light. -The overtly dramatic moments. Preity Zinta screaming, Shahrukh dramatically reading Saif's diary to Preity and Saif being stupid enough not to see his real feelings for her. -The plot really drags.There are other such silly and ridiculous moments. However, 'Kal Ho Na Ho' does have very few good moments, especially the scenes that include Saif and Preity and Sulabha Arya's homosexual misunderstanding Saif and Shahrukh. Saif Ali Khan steals the show with his performance. Preity Zinta also does an OK job, nothing outstanding but she's irritatingly too loud at times. Shahrukh Khan plays the usual 'angel' to the rescue and hams it up. It's one of his worst performances. But his scenes with Saif and Sulabha Arya are hilarious. Jaya Bhaduri does not impress much as she's strictly okay. Reema Lagoo does better in a briefer role. Sonali Bendre was totally wasted. Why did she even bother? Nikhil Advani's direction is very poor as he fails to engage or bring any balance in the story. The music is forgettable too and so is this movie.",

The film is a well-balanced blend of typical Karan Johar bonhomie and the modern hip-hop culture and the result is a delightful treat-to-watch. The USP of KHNH is its brilliant star-cast and trendy music. Thats where the film signs off in style. The film is good enough to go down as one of the best ever ( probably the 6th in SRK's kitty)ACTING: SRK (shah rukh Khan) shows that he is getting better with age. After delivering some of Bollywood's biggest blockbusters like DDLJ, KKHH, DTPH and Baazigar, King Khan makes another significant contribution with KHNH. His portrayal of Aman, is poignantly done and weighs romance, style and flair on an equal footing. If SRK is the king of the film ,Preity Zinta is the undisputed queen. The dimpled darling's increasing demand in Bollywood is natural after she delivers such good performances. Her role as the central character in the story- Neha Katherine Kapoor, is strong and likable. Zinta shows all the variants of acting - from poignancy during death hours to rocking vibes in the song Its the time to Disco. Saif too has a great role in the film as compliments the King Khan beautifully. MUSIC : Rocking, youthful and yet melodious. Watch out for the moving title track.A must see , specially for all SRK-Preity fans",

All three actors played their parts very well. The friendship between the three of them was quite touching.Half way through the movie I realized I was going to need a box of tissues, especially when Naina's baby sister thought she was the trouble for the family. When she asked her Mother when God would send an angel to them, I found myself wanting to cuddle her and tell her it would all be okay. Even though Naina seemed to be a negative personality, you had to learn why she had become the way she was. Eventually, you knew that Aman and Rohit were both drawn to her. You just assumed that one of the men would likely fall in love with her, but with all the twists and turns in the story, you weren't able to decide what was going to happen. Just when I thought I had it all figured out, something different would occur and throw me off track.The \"other woman\" in the movie caught me completely off guard! I thought for sure that I had her pegged correctly and knew what she was all about, but I was wrong.Like I said, there are many unexpected twists and turns in this movie, but as for the ending, well, just watch and see!",

Her dad is gone, her mom and grandmother are constantly fighting, and if that isn't enough, their restaurant business is on the verge of being shut down. She never seems to smile and enjoy her youth. The only time she lets herself go a bit is with her playboy wannabe friend Rohit (Saif Ali Khan), who is her buddy from MBA courses. Suddenly, a stranger enters Naina's unhappy world. This stranger is none other than Aman Mathur (Shah Rukh Khan), a happy-g-lucky guy who teaches Naina that life should be lived, not wasted. Naina ends up falling in love with Aman, but he rejects her love. But if Aman cannot reciprocate Naina's feelings, why is he pushing Rohit to admit he has a soft spot for her? Why can't Aman be with Naina? Where does Rohit fit into this complicated problem?Kal Ho Naa Ho is an extremely fun-filled movie, and I found everything to be perfect until it got to the interval. The second half was cheesy, dramatic, and unrealistic, though I am being a little harsh. But it was not believable at all, in contrast to the first half, which I found extremely believable and real (to an extent, anyway - Bollywood is still Bollywood). I liked the way the director Nikhil Advani started and ended the movie, and I think the scenery was beautiful. Every shot screamed New York. I give KHNH an 8/10 only because this movie is true Bollywood fun, again, only up to the interval. The music also contributes greatly to my rating.Shah Rukh Khan was okay as Aman. I have seen him do much better and therefore am not too fond of his performance here. I found myself agreeing with a lot of the reviews that said he was 'hamming'. But I am inclined to believe that it was the overly emotional script, and not him, to blame. Saif Ali Khan, delivered a very powerful performance. I am a big fan of his films and find this to be one of his best, he was extremely real and fitted into Rohit's shoes completely. However, I have to say that this film completely belongs to Preity Zinta. I found her to be very believable in her role, apart from a few over-expressive scenes. This was also her best look, she never looked more beautiful. The rest of the cast, including Jaya Bachchan, were all fantastic.The music was a BIG bonus point. KHNH has a fantastic soundtrack, each song different and melodious. I enjoyed each and every song, and can listen to all over and over again. Very catchy. Kal Ho Naa Ho is everything Bollywood needs to make a commercial success. Don't get me wrong, I love this film. But it isn't outstanding cinema, purely fun, and that only in the first half.",

Her bumbling friend Rohit is also maybe the only redeeming factor before Aman's arrival and he undergoes a change of attitude, after starting off as something of a womaniser.The music is great and very memorable(especially the main one, that shares the title of the film), as well as the big dance numbers, as expected in a lot of Bollywood films and the score itself.The acting is particularly convincing from the cast, even the kids and the costumes are great, as well as the cinematography, which looks quite impressive compared to other Bollywood films I've seen - obviously it's probably the result of quite high production values.While it is very, very tragic and heart-rending mostly somewhere in the middle towards the end, it's presenting the harsh realities of life that terrible things can happen. Before these heartfelt scenes is some amusing moments mostly earlier on.The main theme of learning to love runs strongly throughout and a strong connection is found when realisation of the object of one's affection may or may not reciprocate this feeling.Overall, it's a touching, and extremely tear-jerking film, well worth watching for the entire three hour running time.

I have a special connection with this film and its believable characters especially Aman{SRK}. I regard this as his best role. Aman is the greatest character in the history of Bollywood. The main reason for it is the way he played with my emotions was unbelievable, he made me laugh out loud initially and during the climax he melted my heart and I cried with him. I've never seen and maybe will never see another more vibrant and colorful character. Kudos!The background score is also tremendously strong and emotional. Excellent score by SEL. The music/songs were awesome. My favourite of the lot was the title track sung by Sonu Nigam, which instantly became my all time favourite song before I even saw the film, just listen to its lyrics...Again PERFECT!The story is relatively very simple but the film does a superb job in showing it. People may say the last part of the film is too emotional and not required but I strongly disagree. This film gave me exactly what I wanted...Complete satisfaction. Perfect acting {by all}, Perfect music, Perfect story.In all, A Gem of Indian Cinema IMO and my one and only favourite Hindi film of all time. Enough said!Rating: 10/10",

Yet there are some well done emotional scenes but at times some funny scenes are not too funny, except the Rajpal scene which is funny, sometimes the humour isn't too good There are some good scenes like Preity's breakdown after thinking that Srk is married and Srk's outburst even the emotional tale is well handled like towards the climax, Even the Saif-Srk scenes at times are well handled but the Kantaben track however famous it became does seem odd, As in most KJO films the gay track is mandatory, even that many religions in one family does seem confusing, Sushma Seth - Dara Singh love affair is weirdDirection by Nikhil Advani is good Music by SEL is good and upbeat, most songs are still rememberedSrk does his job well as usual, nothing unique but as usual it got praise from his fans, Saif is superb in his part Preity Zinta is good too in her part, though at times she does seem too much Amongst rest Sushma Seth is good, Shoma Anand and rest are okay some ham too Lilette Dubey is good, Delnaaz is good Dara Singh is good too in a stupid role, Shulbha Arya is funny Satish Shah is okay, Jaya Bachchan is amazing, Simone Singh is good Reema Lagoo is good, Sonali Bendre and Sanjay Kapoor have cameos and are good, Rajpal Yadav is funny in his small role Predictabily Kajol and Rani Mukherjee have appearances as in most KJO films",

            "content": "Kal ho naa ho - A story by Karan Johar about dying and losing loved ones, directed by Nikhil Advani. If we can think of this as a KJ film then it is number three. KKHH tackled love and lust, K3G was all about loving the parents and KHNH is all about loss. This is the number two KJ film for me - the number one spot belongs to KANK. I am entertained and frustrated by KHNH. There is so much to like in the film and so much that completely undermines any quality the film has. The Kapur family (Preity as Naina, Jaya as Jennifer, and two cute little kids) badly needs a guardian angel and along comes Aman Mathur (SRK). He reforms the dowdy Naina, falls for her but hooks her up with Rohit (the dashing Saif), fixes other sundry problems in the family while still struggling with his own massive problem. He is the centerpiece around whom the film revolves but the other revolving pieces are what make this a very watchable film.I really like Kal Ho Na Ho the film, but think it is one of SRK's worst roles (and he has several). He was fun and funny for about 2/3 of the film - I actually liked the tongue in cheek putting him on a pedestal, his chemistry with Saif rocked, but then along came the heart problem. I have to say that the director sucks big time if he cannot get the most emotional actor of our time to do emotions well. When in the brash or comic mode he was great. His interaction with the Kapoor sisters, with Saif, the six days to get the girl bit (why only six? because I don't work on Sundays!) was hilarious. And the sheer exuberance of Pretty woman can always lift my spirits. But running through New York city, dancing like a demented man at the engagement - all of this was so silly. A totally lost opportunity for him - with just a few fixes this could have been the role of a life time.Preity was very good as Naina - one of my favorite Preity roles. She was drab, then cute and did the job exceedingly well. Saif was BRILLIANT - no false steps, the comic timing was impeccable. And his deadpan dialog delivery had me in stitches - Guru, who Guru? He underplayed the perturbation with the whole Aman Naina relationship. I think a man in his situation might have wondered more about what was happening. Jaya was awesome - I really like this lady and her performance every time. Rajpal Yadav - Guru the video pirate, awesome too. In fact the scene with the mix-up at dinner is one of my favorite comedy scenes in cinema. The whole Punjab Gujarat thing was also quite funny. And SEL gave the film some really good music, the title number is hauntingly sad, Disco is peppy, Pretty woman is inspired (well maybe by Pretty woman but still inspired!), Kuch to hua hai is fun and Mahi ve energetic and foot tapping good.The film is illogical about SRK's illness, making him run through NY city, etc. I can even accept that he sacrifices his love as he wants the girl he loves to be happy - but the silly histrionics along the way are just too much! However, I can watch KHNH anytime for the comedy - it is a really funny film, and I love the music.",

            "content": "Well, if you are as new to the Bollywood phenomenon as I am, you will be as confused by this movie as I was (... and if you are a Bollywood expert, you should skip this review). To Eureopean tastes, and probably also to American tastes, many aspects of the movie seem to be implausible. The male lead, Shah Rukh Khan, THE Indian Top Star, seems not be able to act, but nobody seems to care; the story is outrageously simple and pure kitsch; the movie is extremely long; the actors tend to break out in song and dance for no reason whatsoever; etc. However, the movie is quite charming in its way. The actors, Khan included, are lovable and do not even try to display any skills at the Robert de Niro-type of method acting. The overly emotional acting is highlighted by dramatic panning and freak breezes that even turn up in closed rooms, but it is exactly what the audiences want, and it goes hand in hand with the over-the-top lavish extravaganza of the sets and the well-choreographed song and dance sequences, since ENTERTAINMENT is all the movies aim at. So, if you are a purist, if you cannot accept kitsch for all it is worth and if you want psychological drama instead of bright sets and sentimental love stories, DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE. If, however, you occasionally indulge in something that is neither intellectually challenging nor deemed high art, but that is clean, bright and bubbly fun, you will enjoy this picture. There I will not bother you with a synopsis but I will only point out that you will probably want to watch one or two other movies to understand this phenomenon. The chances are high that you will see the same actors again, playing the same roles again, only with different names.",

The film is somewhat uneven, the comedy scenes work very well, specially those between Shahrukh and Saif. But the melodramatic bickering between Preity's family members is simply irritating. The musical numbers are catchy. The film is too long and the second half tends to drag. Still worth watching at least on television/DVD.Overall 6/10",

From the beginning till the end, the 3+ hours went by as if it was nothing. The acting of Shahrukh, Saif and Preety were fabulous and on point. Everything in this movie was perfect, not to mention the classic theme song named after the movie. In 2022 I still listen to this masterpiece.

            "review_title": "Can one make a drama that also works as a parody?",
            "content": "I believe that Karan Johar and Nikhil Advani have tried to do a cross between drama and parody. Mind you, it'd have been a hoot if they lampooned the serious Bollywood tearjerkers that are churned out dime a dozen. But they want the cake and eat it too. They want to parody the Bollywood tearjerker and still cater to the section of audience that wants to believe it to be real. I ended up getting a bit disoriented because at times they were showing serious stuff but were laughing behind the scenes and at other times, they took their own script too seriously. It all seems confusing and disastrous. But the end product is not too bad and that is due to the tremendous talent of the crew and cast.Too many movies have been shown where the old ones in US adhere to Indian traditions more ritualistically than those in India and the young ones conveniently go between being the ultra modern (whatever that means!) and ultra traditional as the script demands. They also have the poor girl married off and going to India (Some traditional family from India will ask for her hand) which doesn't make much sense because it seems to defeat the very purpose of uprooting the entire family from India. Kal Ho Naa Ho takes every one of these supposedly serious stuff (including Karan Johar's own DDLJ) and pokes fun at them. The uppity Naina (Priety), the confused Rohit (Saif), the serious grandmother and I must make bold to say, the ultimate do-gooder Aman (none other than Shah Rukh) - everyone of them is a caricature. And they have done these roles before. It is hard to take them very seriously because you get the feeling that the director and the writer are chuckling behind the cameras even as they are filming these scenes.And then there is the pretty funny, long comedy track of a mistaken homosexual relationship between Saif and Shah Rukh. That \"O ... Kantabhen\" just puts it way over the top. I laughed like crazy. Is there an inside joke there Karan and Nikhil?I don't know if I should say the casting is perfect or the performance is perfect for the parody. Every time I think nobody can ever act more theatrical than Shah Rukh, he out does himself. His performances are so unnatural and stilted that they are actually funny. With all the parodying going on, I am wondering if Karan and Nikhil decided to milk Shah Rukh for all he is worth and make him ham it up even more! Saif Ali Khan acts brilliantly in his repeat performance of Dil Chahta Hai and so does Priety Zinta of a number of her own roles.Then, the writer-director duo decide to take things seriously and the problem is I still can't stop laughing. That makes it uneasy. They take every dramatic scene, blow it out of proportion - as is the convention of Bollywood standards - and keep showing it long after it has exhausted all its dramatic potential. This makes the second half of the movie a bit uneasy to watch. Particularly when Shah Rukh leaves the hospital to go convince Saif and Priety, I was very uneasy. Then they show Saif Ali Khan in that I'm-20-years-older-so-I-need-gray-hairs wig that is just too much!Overall, it was an interesting movie. Somehow I feel that the filmmakers had more fun making it than we have watching it. Makes me wish I was involved in the process! 7 out of 10.PS: The only issue I have with the gay joke is this - India is one of the few countries where men are not as inhibited and uptight as those from Europe or US. After this movie, I am afraid that Indian guys are going to become a lot more self-conscious about non-sexual intimacy between each other. It is a pity!",

And there some slick editing . And clever dialogs . Preity Zinta looks great and does a commendable job with her limited skills as an actress. Satish Shah is terrific . So many good things in parts. But the overall picture is overshadowed by SharRukh Khan's presence. His performance brings down the whole effort at film-making like a tidal wave would wash away a little girl's pretty sandcastle. Just when you've settled down to enjoy a movie well begun , Shahrukh's makes his entry on the screen. Saif's comic scenes , Preity's restrained acting , and the peripheral crews little bits and pieces just struggle to keep the movie interesting , but Shahrukh Khan's overacting again and again will make you bring your claws to your hair.Beware , he'll try to make you laugh , but you'll cry at your fate. He'll then try to make you cry at his plight and you will growl at your stupidity for not having run away to someplace safe . His effect on the whole movie is such that very soon the whole movie will turn against you and make you cry..and CRY ...and REALLY SOB YOUR HEART OUT , but in reality you just will keep hoping this will end sometime soon. But the movie will get the better of you because its so long. If you're watching it at home , you will try to fast-forward the weepy-song in the end , and just when you think its gone , it will rise like Phoenix and start all over again. The movie had one positive effect on me in the end. I realized how interesting it would have been if I'd done my laundry on already washed and ironed shirts.

Indian Cinema is abound with gorgeously tragic love-stories, filmed and scripted in such a way that they want to make you laugh at points and cry your heart out to. This to Western viewers almost shameless playing to the emotions is what I like about Indian cinema, and makes me proud of my own Indian heritage.This movie has the comedy part right, with the running gag of SRK and Saif being gay lovers (to Kantaben's dismay), but it doesn't get enough out of the tragedy part. The reason? A flaw in the script: we see SRK and Preity falling in love - and then he turns her away. Only at that point in the movie do we get to understand that SRK has an unexplained and fatal heart-disease, and that he loves Preity so much that he doesn't want to put her through the tragedy of being with him whilst he dies.Now, this motive is noble enough to build a beautiful story on. My problem: the extent of SRK's sacrifice would have been so much clearer if we would have known beforehand and all the way through when they fall in love. Surely SRK's capability to play the tragic hero was way up to that challenge, and it would have added a logic and drive which the first part of the movie missed.There were many things to make the movie really enjoyable though. As people above have stated already, Kal Ho Naa Ho sets an example of how to blend Western and Indian Cinema in a believable and working fashion. In that sense it really sets a standard for other movies and for that the movie should be lauded. But with all those Easter Eggs ( I didn't know the Wim Wenders reference for example), guest appearances and what not, I do start to wonder: wasn't this especially a movie for other movie makers? All in all, a nice movie to spend your sundayevening on with your family - but not brilliant.",

Rohit is her best friend, a flirt who is generally unlucky with women and finds her unattractive. With Aman's help, they begin to see what should have been obvious all along. Kal ho naa ho's main theme is about living in the moment, and following your heart. It doesn't sound very original, but it's executed in a way that feels new anyhow. I love the incorporation of the tension in Naina's household between her grandmother and basically the rest of them due to a tragic event in their past that has colored every aspect of their lives and ways of seeing one another. Aman invades their lives in every way as well, and it's funny to see him tease Naina even though you can see a tiny hint of affection towards her every now and tehn. Naina's stiffness and stubbornness isn't too annoying as you can sympathize with her, and you see that she's holding herself back because she doesn't know what she wants. Rohit is an interesting character as he isn't what he seems to be, and it's easy to root for him despite the fact that Aman is played by Sharukh Khan and it's pretty hard to compete with that\u0085I found Aman's character very inspiring, due to his selflessness and unwillingness to impose on those he cares about. It was especially intense when after the diary scene he was so overwhelmed by his own heartache that he was unable to face Rohit. And I love the ending where Aman actually jumps out of his hospital bed and runs across the city just to see Naina and Rohit. I also like that they addressed the fact that Rohit was being coached by Aman into 'wooing' Naina and the fact that this would most likely upset her, as well as the way they handled it. I think the cutest part was when Aman was on his deathbed and he asked Gia to marry him, and Gia said no, but when he said 'please?' she agreed. There is a running joke that pokes fun at gay men, or at least at those who are disgusted by them. I suppose its not too offensive, although the fact that the actual gay guy that they have at the end (the designer guy) was overly, uh, feminine probably isn't a coincidence. Rohit's dad's line about passing 'the cock' was amusing, though. The music is very nice and generally helps to further the plot. it's the right mix of slow, romantic, cheerful, melancholic, and lively music. 'It's the time to disco' may be a cheesy song title, but it's very catchy and the sequence is energetic and beautifully shot. Overall, Kal Ho Naa Ho is a beautiful movie that is shot in a lavish and over-the-top way that is characteristic of bollywood, but its heart is in the right place. It feels sincere and the story can be universally appreciated.",

Although as a fan of Baroque Opera, I don't really have much difficulty with the basic premises of the Bollywood style!Having said that, this was possibly the most interesting Bollywood movie I've seen to date - especially in its attempt to incorporate elements of Western pop culture, including several blatant references to American movies, from Grease and a spoofed James Bond to Brad Silberling's City of Angels, which evidently contributed a lot to the way Shahruk Khan's character is handled (including him starting to see things in black and white when he is near dying - that one goes back all the way to Wim Wenders!).The soundtrack is stunning, and again it's great to see the way the New York setting gives opportunity to mix in some Western elements in an intelligent way. The dance and song numbers are a true joy, and it doesn't hurt that they are better integrated into the plot than in most Indian movies I've seen.Shahruk Khan is nicely parodying himself - at least, I thought he was... maybe I'm wrong??? :-o - I also particularly enjoyed the running joke about Aman and Rohit being a homosexual couple - one could indeed ask oneself who is really in love with who here? And why exactly does Aman prefer to love vicariously rather than going for the girl himself? It's also perhaps significant that it is Rohit rather than Naina who stays with Aman to the last. I am sure the filmmakers are intelligent enough to be aware of these undercurrents, even if perhaps most audiences aren't!In any case, watching this movie (with a very sympathetic audience at a foreign film showcase here in Wellington, people who actually laughed in most of the *right* places!) was a pure joy and it makes me happy to see how Indian cinema is finally beginning to be perceived as a legitimate part of international film culture even by Western audiences, rather than just an exotic oddity - something that Chinese and Japanese movies, for instance, have already achieved to a much greater degree!",

Actually, Kal Ho Na Ho is more than just a love story, in fact; it's a story about not just love, but also hope, happiness and life! Kal Ho Na Ho is surprisingly NOT clich\u00e9. Another thing to mention, even though the film is about a dying man - it does not sadden or depress the viewer. In fact, even with a obvious sad ending, the viewer leaves with strange sense of happiness and hope.Naina Kapoor is a girl lost on life and hope after the suicide of her father. Her mother, Jenifer is running an unsuccessful business and hardly making ends meet. Rohit Patel is a struggling advertising agent in New York City who is in love with Naina but has not realized it yet.Enters Aman Mathur, an energetic, lovable, positive and full of life guy who claims he has come to New York to get married. After a shaky start, they all kick it off and become friends. Naina falls for Aman but suddenly is told by Aman that he is married.Who is Aman? Is he really married? Will Naina get her love? Will Rohit get his love? The films I hate most are the ones that leave many questions unanswered. Hence, I respect writers like Karan Johar who don't force the viewers to say \"Who cares? It's just a movie\" so that they can try forgive poor writing. Thankfully Kal Ho Na Ho does not leave you confused on anything.Another thing to mention is the great mix of comedy and emotions in this movie. Karan does that in all his films but here it's writing at its best! More pluses? Strong characters. We understand all the characters well. There's not a single main character that is weak. SRK's chemistry with each actor is worth mentioning. Whether it's with Jaya, Priety and especially with Saif. They're simply hilarious! Now why am I focusing on characters and other stuff over the sets, music etc. Because I feel Kal Ho Na Ho is one of the best written films ever. The plot unfolds flawlessly. The film is near 3 hours but not once do you feel like you're watching such a long film.Some noteworthy scenes: SRK's intro. The restaurant scene is inspiring and funny. Priety going to confess her love to SRK. SRK stating why Preity's dad committed suicide. Climax. The Katan Behan scenes are rib tickling.The film is technically brilliant. The whole New York look is excellent. It is the city I grew up in and it is great to see how they showcased the beauty. It would not be wrong to state that NYC is also a character in the movie.Shankar-Esaan-Loy's music is soothing and fits in well with the screenplay. No song is even remotely forced.I do want to add that Javed Akhtar's lyrics are out of this world for the title track. One of the best lyrics and songs of all time. It's in my top 5 for sure.Nikhil Advani's direction is flawless. He cannot make a better film than this. One would agree with me if they have seen his next 3 films after this. Honestly, I would not be surprised if I found out Karan Johar ghost directed this.The winner here is indubitably the writing of the movie. The screenplay is engaging, enjoyable and entertaining. The dialogues are amazing. The funny one's make you tear up in happiness and the sad ones do the opposite. They're effective nonetheless.Saif Ali Khan is a revelation. Many say Dil Chahta Hai was a performance that changed his career but I would say it was Kal Ho Na Ho that took the actor out of him. He is different to say the least. He's terrific in every scene.Preity Zinta gives her career best performance. She's inconsistent in many movies but here she's just lovely. Not to forget how beautiful she looks.Jaya Bachchan is looking great and of course acts in form. She suits the role to the T! Satish Shah, Rajpal Yadav, the lady who plays Kanta Behan and others bring great comic relief.I've heard and read a lot that Preity and/or Saif stole the show in the movie. WRONG! They were outstanding, there's no doubt. However, the life of the movie is Shah Rukh Khan. His energy, effort, comic timing, everything has so much positivity to it. It would not be wrong to state that SRK brings the happiness, charm, color to Kal Ho Na Ho. He completes this wonderful treat.Overall - Kal Ho Na Ho is not to depress you. The film will make you think about all the little things in your life that you may take for granted. Above all, it's a beautiful story with moments you will surely take home with you.",

Jaya Bachan is a kind mother but sometimes I don \u064ft like her performance. although she is good for her role.SRK is like always,charming,full of energy and has a good performance. The other actors and actresses like Delnaz Irani and the others,make \"Kal Ho Naa Ho\" a comedy movie.The emotional scenes like when Aman is dancing with Naina in his dream or when he is reading Rohit \u064fs blank notebook for her or the last scene make the movie a romantic movie.the good and real relation ship between the characters and the story about life make the movie drama.the dialogues are great and have some thing to say.some of them are really unforgettable like:\"Listen,Laugh,Be happy,Maybe tomorrow never comes.\" The story is \u064fnt a new thing but it \u064fs lovely and amazing.\"Kal Ho Naa Ho\" learned me some important things about life that i \u064fve never paid attention to them.

Kal Ho Naa Ho is the latest endeavor and it is no different than any other Yash Raj film. It follows the usual formula and is quite successful at it.\nSPOILERThe story goes something like this... Saif Ali Khan falls in love with his best friend Preity Zinta. Preity falls in love with her new neighbour Shah Rukh Khan. SRK loves her, but plays cupid for her and SAK, because he's... dying. For SRK Kal Ho Naa Ho, literally.The story is quite moving. SRK gives a wonderful performance as usual. SAK plays the playboy who finally finds his true love as he has so many times before. And Preity is the love interest who gets sandwiched in. Kal Ho Naa Ho follows the formula and is executed beautifully. Apart from a few flaws, such as the ease of SRK's qurbani and Preity's acceptance of this qurbani, it's a lovely tale with lovely songs and lovely cameos from Rani and Kajol.****/5 stars",

I loved the mixture of Indian and western music in the songs \"pretty woman\", \"Maahive\" and \"Kuch to Hua Hai\". The character of Priety Zinta is serious but she is funny. Shah Rukh Khan as usual is lively in role of Aman Mathur. However, the actor I like the most in this is Saif Ali Khan. The photography, editing and sound mixing were also of notable quality. The narrative advancing of the critical portions in the movie provides the depth in the story. Jaya Bachan's role has also been another great one.

The movies which I am talking about are \"Anand\", \"Bawarachi\", and \"Safar\". The role played by SRK is straight out of the Rajesh Khanna Characters played in the movies I mentioned.  Well about the film, the technical aspects of the movie was great especially the editing. And good camera work.About the performances, Preity is on the top. She has proved by \"Kya Kehna\" that she can take a movie on her shoulder all alone and in this movie she stood with the established actors and proved herself that she is NO. 1 in acting and better than her colleagues.Second in the performance is Saif Ali Khan who has proved again that in the league of Khan's he next to Amair Khan, who is obviously First in this league. After Saif Salman and SRK follows. Saif take my words this years awards coming into your lap.Srk has nothing new to offer. For the last 10 years he is playing the same kind of role. Jaya Bachhan and Sushma Seth excellent performances. Lillete Dubey good in comic roles and she is a damn good performer and has given one more grat performance after \"Gadar\", \"Monsoon Wedding\" and \"Baghban\".Good Family Entertainer but few scenes are objectionable and feel uncomfortable while wacthing with your family. Scenes such as played by Lillete Dubey and between Saif and SRK where SRK pretends to be a homosexual and such roles we are seeing nowadays very often like in kuch na kaho mango souffle bombay boys and many others, and the role played by the Sulbha Arya was over. Their was no need of this character and director tried to make the audience laugh but it was very cheap.On the whole, 2.5 out of 5.",

            "review_title": "The new generation of Bollywood-filmmakers...",
            "content": "Expecting `Kal Ho Naa Ho' (''Tomorrow May Never Come'') being the best movie of the year 2003 gives you certain anticipations that have to be accomplished. One might ask how `Dharma Productions' is again able to live up to the viewer's expectations and with `Kal Ho Naa Ho' I feel they have come up with the best implemented movie so far. Emotional entertainers like `Kuch Kuch Hota Hai' and `Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham' have given Bollywood another new face but after the release of 2001 critical acclaimed Super-Chill-Hit `Dil Chahta Hai' a new generation of Bollywood-filmmaking has been launched. Farhan Akhtar's imposing storytelling has inspired lots of writers and directors to follow this new created path. Karan Johar (story & screenplay) as well as Nikhil Advani (director) have obeyed successfully this new way or even surpassed it by assembling the typical Karan Johar-touch to it; this film is more than a `Dil Chahta Hai'-copy. But unquestioned it's evident they tried to recreate a `Dil Chahta Hai'-magic with involving Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy (\u0091Koi Kahe Kehta' \u0096 DCH & \u0091It's Time To Disco' \u0096KHNH) to compose the score while Preity Zinta and Saif Ali Khan (his character \u0091Rohit' resembles a lot to \u0091Sameer' from DCH) are also part of the main cast.The story center Naina Catherine Kapur (Preity Zinta) and her family problems which emerge after a tragic incidence. Since this occurrence her life has become cold, grey and dull which is eminent reflected by New York City at winter. Entering Aman Mathur (Shah Rukh Khan) dark clouds seem to allow some sunshine in the lives of the Kapur's. Helping others to solve their problems, face life's little challenges \u0096 Aman has all the answers. In fact he is the angel the family has prayed for\u0085 Although Naina is not willing to let Aman interfere in her problems, his dedication to her family makes her falling in love with him. Hence the smile that has already died has returned on her lips. Due to Aman's secret heart-disease he is not in the position to return his love to her though doesn't want her to become the old grey Naina again. Rohit (Saif Ali Khan), a crony Naina's, who privily has feelings for her, should return Aman's love allusively. According to this Aman is helping Rohit to win Naina's love (great work by Nikhil and Karan with the `Six Day Plan'). As soon as everything seems to have turned out well, Aman's illness has been unintentional revealed\u0085Aman however never dies and stays immortal forever, as the angel who has answered their prayers\u0085Johar's screenplay has been written very well and his mergence between comical and dramatic situations (e.g. the `Sardar'-scene with the two `Bhagat Singhs') is remarkable. The `Ghalat Ghar'-sequence for example exhibits Karan Johar's talent in writing delightful comic scenes. The transitions between these scenes are excellent. During the second half of the film the screenplay looses its pace and it's getting more emotional and dramatic though at parts it ties in with the tempo (introduction of Rohit's parents and Camilla followed by Aman's `Six Day Plan') of the first half. Admittedly the last scene which takes place 20 years later is unessential and examines the viewer's patience. One of the best parts of `Kal Ho Naa Ho' is the dialogues written by Niranjan Iyengar. They are poignant, funny, and therefore very memorable and have been borne excellently by all performers. Aman Mathur's character is absolutely suitable for Shah Rukh Khan and thus there is no actor in this industry who could have done justice to this role. Yet it's not alike his roles in `Kuch Kuch Hota Hai' or `Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham' as his character demanded to be more rude and arrogant. Still he has the charming factor which makes him to be the darling of the public. I would rate this performance among his memorable ones in the league of `Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge', `Dil Se..', `Hey!Ram!', `Asoka'\u0085. Saif Ali Khan's appearance resembles a lot to his performance (as mentioned above) in `Dil Chahta Hai'. He is incredibly good in his comic timing and shares a good chemistry with Shah Rukh Khan as these are potentially the best scenes of the picture. Preity Zinta has definitively delivered her best performance as an actress since her debut in Mani Rathnam's `Dil Se\u0085'. She personates Naina Kapur marvellously. Jennifer Kapur has been one of the few characters that were portrayed differently by Jaya Bachchan. Her energy she has put in her role can be noticed clearly and consequently abounds with a great performance. Satish Shah and Lillette Dubey are incredibly funny. Reema Lagoo as Aman's mother leaves an impressing effect. Coming to the point of the execution of the screenplay Nikhil Advani is a great rediscovery for Indian film industry. After Farhan Akhtar in 2001 and Shaad Ali in 2002, it's Nikhil Advani who has joined the new generation of filmmakers. Effects like `Split-screening' or the frames which have been used during the credits weren't utilized yet in Indian cinema consequently. The movie's start is also very incredible and never seen before in Bollywood as the voice-over technique has been used differently. Important characters are introduced getting a whiff of their all-day lives. One is much irritated and overwhelmed by the start that you might miss out some funny dialogues. Just for that reason one has to watch this film twice!Anil Mehta, cinematographer from hit-films like `Lagaan', `Saathiya' or `Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam', captures views of New York City beautifully. Watch out for the title song! His shots in setting sun are gorgeous.Editing is superb and contributes to the celerity of the film. A classic way of expressing the character's feelings which has been used mostly in literature in the time of `Storm and Stress' can be retrieved. Before Aman Mathur's entry the story takes place in a cold winter location in New York. It's even snowing but abruptly sun enters when Aman Mathur is introduced to the characters. It's raining when Naina finds out that Aman is married. A heavy wind is blowing when it emerges that Aman is dying and after his demise it's snowing again (20 years further). Concerning the music `Kal Ho Naa Ho' features some fresh catchy numbers. `Pretty woman', a remake of Roy Orbison's song, breathed on with a Bhangra touch has been choreographed well. Very nice song but some parts of the tune has reminded me of an A.R. Rahman Tamil song from a Rajnikanth-Film `Baba' (Tippu Tippu Kumari), also sung by Shankar Mahadevan. `It's Time to Disco' that tries to tie up to Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy's disco-number from `Dil Chahta Hai' is unnecessary and not much thrilling. `Kuch To Hua Hai' is a lovely song that should illustrate a situation when you are falling in love. It's been shot very charming with New Yorkers involved. `Kal Ho Naa Ho' is an inevitable song which has to be in the movie giving the viewers a break after fast paced scenes and to reflect about the lyrics. A lonesome man in the busiest city of the world telling to live every moment because this could be your last instant, a tomorrow may not be! This song ditto gives you an insight of Aman Mathur's feelings; to be in Rohit's skin for one day\u0085. `Mahi Ve' is a characteristic Karan Johar-song that features about 100 dancers at an Indian function wrapped up with the energy of `Say Shava Shava' and `Bole Chudiyan'. The background score is proper to the situations, the beautiful theme music occurs throughout the film in several different versions. On the whole `Kal Ho Naa Ho' is a very well-made movie which surfaces at the right time when Bollywood is undergoing a change. This film has assuredly the ability to keep up with big Hollywood movies as it has everything like awesome comedy, great emotions, fantastic performers and a pulchritudinous story that should even be enjoyed by Western viewers. To label this film as a typical Bollywood-kitsch-movie would be a pure underrating. Needless to say this is a Bollywood-film but one of the new generation...9.5/10",

Jaya has a nice role. Songs are excellent and, in my opinion, the best soundtrack of the year. The portion of \"6 din, ladki in\" in the second half was a bit of a drag, however.

I believe it could be much better.I advice you to watch it but to not expect that much from it so you won't be disappointed.My vote : 7/10.",

What makes it a cut above the average Indian movie is the contribution of individual artists.Karan Johar has done at least three smart things. He has brought in Javed Akhtar as his lyricist,the team of Shankar, Ehsaan, Loy as his composers and above all signed Anil Mehta (who photographed Lagaan and Saathiya) as his cinematographer. All three have done first rate work.His regular, Shah Rukh Khan has not let him down either. Here he shines in the company of Preity Zinta and Saif Ali Khan.Saif Ali Khan is a pleasure to watch. He repeatedly brings down the house with his comic timing.The screenplay needed more work. The writing generally is not up to Karan Johar standard. It seems to me that the brilliant Karan Johar(No doubt about that) is spreading himself too thin.For his future productions, he should take writers like Javed Siddiqui or Gulrez Syed(currently working on Akbar Khan's Taj Mahal).And he is a young man.

Wait, he didn't act at all, he let Aman (his character) enter his body and he became Aman. Preity Zinta did an excellent job. Karan Johar made a good choice of choosing her. To be honest, if Kareena Kapoor would be Naina, it would not make an impact at all. Saif Ali Khan blew my mind off! He's amazing! I was impressed, I can totally relate to his character. Overall, the main actors were 11 out of 10.Overall, Kal Ho Naa Ho is the best movie I've ever seen in my entire life. A perfect film for everyone.

Naina lives with her mother Jennifer(Jaya Bachchan looking refreshing, having lost a lot of weight) her grandmother(Sushma Seth)and her two younger siblings. They run a small Indian Restaurant which is not doing to well. Naina also studies for a MBA along with her close friend Rohit Patel( Saif Ali Khan Pataudi). Apparently the family is having a lot of problems one of which is between Jennifer and her grand mother.Enter Aman(Shah Rukh Khan) who comes in to save the day. He sings , he dances , he romances. Predictably Naina falls for him. But he has a secret like most hindi film hero seem to be having. I dare not reveal the secret as that would be in bad taste , but you get no points for guessing. Anyways Rohit is in love with Naina and the rest as they say is a hindi film.Johar who wrote the screenplay himself might have had a decent idea in mind but the final outcome is a big disappointment for me at least. The screenplay is a mess , Johar has filled the screenplay with small comedic set pieces that really do not move the story ahead infact are just excuses for more song situations or melodrama.The tone shifts from comedy to drama between scenes and the drama plays more like comedy. The comedic scenes too while few do manage a smile like KANTABEN  are mostly just not funny. The climax is so long drawn out that at one point i wanted to take matters into my own hands(if you have seen the film you will know what i mean).The music by shankar, ehsaan and loy is good specially the title track but having said that i am sure Roy Orbison would be turning in his grave if he ever heard shankar ehsaan loy's version of his famed PRETTY WOMAN.I have always liked Anil Mehta(Hum Dil de chuke sanaam , Lagaan) and he captures NY well.Of the performances i personally liked Preity Zinta who is quite endearing . Saif Ali Khan while i know many will disagree with me just seemed to be doing another version of the character he played in DIL CHAHATA HAI. Shah Rukh Khan really sinks this film for me.It seems shah rukh khan is always playing shah rukh khan whether he is potraying ASOKA THE GREAT or DEVDAS or here.The direction by Nikhil Advani is wayward and i wonder how much of Johar's influence (him being the producer as well) was on the final product. Nikhil himself comes from more serious cinema having worked on films like IS RAATH KE SUBHA NAHI. I hope he does some more work like that.Overall i applaud the efforts of the cast and crew for making this film. God knows its tough filming overseas, and they have been rewarded with the film doing blockbuster business.But i personally feel Indian Cinema needs more responsible and path breaking films from Dharma productions who are considered to be one of the leading production houses in india , if the indian film industry is to make a mark internationally.Call me MPD",

New York is captured so beautifully and for the second time within a very short time frame (After the suprisingly well treated, and refreshingly different 'Out of Control') New York has been made the heart of the storyline in a way that does not stand out and remind you it doesn't fit in with your regular serving of bollywood protagonists. Nor is it one of the locales, one that appears in a brief period of the movie or a song -its right there as the setting of the entire movie, all throughout.Nothing in the script occurs because the setting is NY and not Mumbai for e.g. to remind you that the location is relevant. This has been attempted with a lot of movies no doubt, Yaadein for e.g., not so much K3G, which has an overlap with India, but each time the characters have felt out of place. In Kal Ho Na Ho(KHNH), I must say I was able to enjoy an NY setting, without getting distracted from the story. So that's a definite plus. Then comes the maturity in terms of absence of melodrame and sensitivity to audience emotions - Aman (SRK)had to die, otherwise the story would have lost its meaning, and yet seeing Aman take his last breath in a dramatic fall of his hand from Rohit's(Saif) palm or a turn of the head on the pillow would have made me wince, and left a bitter taste in my mouth. That bitter taste would take away the warm, somehow feel goodness about how we can move on and things can turn out once you accept the inevitability of death that Karan (by way of script) or Nikhil (by way of direction and final presentation) had very very carefully managed to build up in me till that point. That was very beautifully handled, and though I did well to not let tears run free, I did not really come out heartbroken either :-) , in a way that would discourage me from seeing the movie again etc or want to forget it.So improvement there :) Improvement also in a way, that there seems to be a sprinkling of somethign for everyone in a just right balance that has been so elusive to the best of filmakers. Focus too much on a tight storyline and you end up with a gut wrencher like Aks that is so dark that there is no emotional relief during the 3 hours and the movie doesnt click, or mix one element too many to provide that relief and audiences come out of the theatre wondering where the joker fit into what had potential to be an intense script!!! KHNH seems to have found that balance and people were laughing loudly at the humour, as well as weeping with the emotions :) so that's worked. These are my take aways from the movie, and the things I wanted to focus on in the review becasue everyting else is summarised in the first line -Classic Dharma production. Beautiful locales, wonderful perfomances, superb music and feel good , 'shudh desi ghee main prepared' Indian emotional appeal :)Should definitely work, and take Bollywood one step further in the conventional channel, just as films like KMG are tapping unconventional channels :)",

            "content": "Too many movies have been shown where the old ones in US adhere to Indian traditions more ritualistically than those in India and the young ones conveniently go between being the ultra modern (whatever that means!) and ultra traditional as the script demands. They also have the poor girl married off and going to India (Some traditional family from India will ask for her hand) which doesn't make much sense because it seems to defeat the very purpose of uprooting the entire family from India. Kal Ho Naa Ho takes every one of these supposedly serious stuff (including Karan Johar's own DDLJ) and pokes fun at them. The uppity Naina (Priety), the confused Rohit (Saif), the serious grandmother and I must make bold to say, the ultimate do-gooder Aman (none other than Shah Rukh) - everyone of them is a caricature. And they have done these roles before. It is hard to take them very seriously because you get the feeling that the director and the writer are chuckling behind the cameras even as they are filming these scenes.And then there is the pretty funny, long comedy track of a mistaken homosexual relationship between Saif and Shah Rukh. That \"O ... Kantabhen\" just puts it way over the top. I laughed like crazy. Is there an inside joke there Karan and Nikhil?I don't know if I should say the casting is perfect or the performance is perfect for the parody. Every time I think nobody can ever act more theatrical than Shah Rukh, he out does himself. His performances are so unnatural and stilted that they are actually funny. With all the parodying going on, I am wondering if Karan and Nikhil decided to milk Shah Rukh for all he is worth and make him ham it up even more! Saif Ali Khan acts brilliantly in his repeat performance of Dil Chahta Hai and so does Priety Zinta of a number of her own roles.Then, the writer-director duo decide to take things seriously and the problem is I still can't stop laughing. That makes it uneasy. They take every dramatic scene, blow it out of proportion - as is the convention of Bollywood standards - and keep showing it long after it has exhausted all its dramatic potential. This makes the second half of the movie a bit uneasy to watch. Particularly when Shah Rukh leaves the hospital to go convince Saif and Priety, I was very uneasy. Then they show Saif Ali Khan in that I'm-20-years-older-so-I-need-gray-hairs wig that is just too much!Overall, it was an interesting movie. Somehow I feel that the filmmakers had more fun making it than we have watching it. Makes me wish I was involved in the process! 7 out of 10.",

            "content": "A plot so ridiculous it's hard to buy into. But worse than that, horrible red flags in a relationship are portrayed as romantic gestures; Aman's 'flirting' with Naina consisting of telling her she looks \"dorky\" in glasses and that she'd look better if she smiled. Really? On top of that, he drags her by the wrist in anger on several occasions and once threatens to hit her unless she \"shuts up\".Up until about half way through this laborious film you're left wondering when it'll become obvious that Aman's behaviour is so because he's an awful person and hoping it'll be a teachable moment, but no, Naina falls in love with him. It's hard to know how anyone can perceive this to be a romantic plot-line whatsoever.The moral of the story appears to be that arranged marriages are bad, but mainly because you can make any woman fall for you if you grind her down enough. It's difficult to tell whether this is a reflection on the director or modern Indian relationships in general but the script is like something from the 1930's.Absolutely zero justification for this to be 3 hours long either. Songs were completely forgettable except for one which heavily borrowed from Roy Orbison's Pretty Woman. Don't waste your time with this film.",

Kal Ho Naa Ho comes with the clich\u00e9d message of following your heart and doing what you want, for who knows whether tomorrow will be? It has been delivered in such a talented and compelling way that one is almost forcibly drawn into its \"fresh\" and gripping plot. Naina is a very serious, no-nonsense college student, with a womanizer Rohit and the all-nonsense Sweetu, whose sister helps run her mother's caf\u00e9, as her closest friends.Enter Aman,a happy-go-lucky man, as her irritating neighbor's nephew, who on noticing the impending gloom hanging over the family, makes it his mission to remove them from the darkness.Initially indifferent towards him, Aman's ability to turn their fortunes around by keeping her family happy, improving their business and helping her find a new meaning in life, Naina finally comes to face the fact that she is in love with Aman. As always, there's a glitch to the perfect ending, as Aman is unable to commit to a relationship due to health complications unknown to Naina and with Rohit finding his true love in the newly-transformed Naina. Despite being madly in love with her himself, Aman lies that he is already married and then focuses on getting Rohit and Naina together..The rest, you must watch to experience the fun yourself. KHNH is funny, touching, beautiful with a great cast, wonderful storyline and amazing soundtrack.IMO, this is Karan Johar at his best, in spite of the ironical fact that it was his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Nikhil Advani who made the magical transformation on to the silver screen. Kudos to both for the amazing effort and a heartfelt thank you for serving us one of Bollywoods best-ever movie..So what are you waiting for? Watch the movie as soon as you can, for who knows:Kal Ho Na Ho?",

I know there are good and bad movies in all genres and all industries. Some I would not recommend watching because they just don't deliver entertainment but this movie does. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to have a good time watching a nice movie. Shahrukh Khan and Saif Ali Khan are extremely funny and they have great chemistry. I was laughing a lot at some of the parts in the movies where they are misunderstood by some of Saif's family and friends. I think Preity looks really great. She's a versatile actor and she plays her part really well. Jaya Bachan is wonderful, always had been, her acting caliber is unmatched. The supporting cast is also just wonderful, they really compliment the movie. I have seen many movies with a big cast that seem to just get in the way, this movie is not like that. It seems like a well thought out movie that is aimed to entertain you. I think that effort deserves some praise and therefore, go watch this movie.",

            "review_title": "A pleasant surprise from the Johar universe",
            "content": "Kal Ho Naa Ho came out in 2003, I was 9 at that time and I was slowly starting to fall out of love with the Karan Johar universe. I hated his second feature Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham mostly because it did not have that youthful vibe which Kuch Kuch did and it was mostly a tearful slog. Dil Chahta Hai came out in 2001 and it was one film which completely blew me away. It felt so realistic, so natural compared to a Johar film and with the memories of this movie in my mind, I stepped into the theater pretty much prepared to dislike KHNH.The film starts off with a voice over from Preity Zinta who plays Naina. She describes all the things that are messed up in her life by introducing each of her family members one by one and highlighting their conflicts and how together they make her life miserable. The only introduction she gives where she seems genuinely happy to introduce that person is Rohit(Saif Ali Khan). So one day a pretty bad fight breaks out in her house involving her grandmother and her sister who's adopted. Trying to console her sad and distraught sister along with her mother Jenny(Jaya Bachchan),she prays to God to help her out, make her life a little better, show some light in this pitch black darkness. That's when we're introduced to Aman(SRK) who we find out is Naina's neighbor's nephew. So SRK is basically introduced as a god- like figure who's out here to solve all of Naina's problems. I literally groaned when I saw this scene and was prepared for another K3G like bore fest where our hero is holier than thou but followed was a genuinely funny, moving, bittersweet tale of love, friendship and sacrifice.Aman initially irritates Naina but in doing so he touches a few emotional chords with her. He becomes her source of liberation. He teaches her that all the baggage in the world isn't on her shoulders and most importantly he teaches her how to smile. Naturally Naina slowly and helplessly falls for Aman not knowing he has a big dark secret which means that they could never be together. Aman realizing this goes to Rohit who he's pretty sure has a crush on Naina to tell him to man up, go after the girl he likes and convert their friendship to love. Rohit initially reluctant, agrees and pursues a dejected Naina. Will Rohit get Naina? What is Aman's dark secret? And why is Aman doing all this for Naina and her family? These are the questions which form the crux of this plot.The film's handling is very deft and extremely stylish. Yes it is a sugar coated world but the problems in this film feel genuine, feel real. The overall screenplay in the first half is exceptional to say the least. SRK's quick witted humor, Saif's callous silliness, Preity's introvertism and her refusal to open up blend seamlessly with the plot. There are also these lovely touches in the screenplay like quick vignettes of the entire cast describing when Naina smiles, or what first love means to them and other abstract thoughts like this during the song sequences. And who can forget the insanely funny \"Kanta Ben\" gag!Its in the second half when the things get emotional and the plot begins to unravel fully do we realize how clich\u00e9d and corny this script is but never at any point in the film are we bored in any way. Even during the heavy duty moments, the humor and jokes keep flowing. The film's director is Nikhil Advani, one of Karan Johar's former trusted associated but you can clearly see Johar's touch evident in a significant portion of the film. The film's script has ridiculous plot holes and huge lapses in logic by the time it reaches its conclusion which seem laughable and overly romanticized in this era of realistic films and filmmakers like Kashyap, Dibakar, Bhardwaj etc. But then for me a good film is never about a realistic or believable story but more about the conviction with which a director pulls his story off and the and how true he is to himself and to the material which Advani does with supreme and utmost conviction.Now coming to the performances Saif is absolutely delightful here. Yes, he has done this role a plethora of times in the past, but within the context of this movie, he is cast absolutely perfectly. Preity does a fine job as well. Naina's role is written in such a way that if the performance hadn't been convincing, the character would have come off as quite annoying. But Preity truly makes us care, she is restrained and heartfelt in the emotional scenes and totally game in the comic ones. And finally Shahrukh, this isn't a performance as much as it is a greatest collection hits of all his previous roles. The lip quivering, the over emotional stammer, its all there. But you got to give it to him for sustaining his style for so many years and doing it with absolutely no qualms. Despite all the lack of restraint and subtlety in SRK's acting, his charisma, his style, his panache is unmatchable and even here you hopelessly fall in love with Aman.Over the years I've revisited KHNH multiple times and it is definitely one of the films from my childhood which has a special place in my heart and which still reminds me what a charismatic actor SRK is and how he quickly became the 4 year old me's absolute favorite. Yes it will seem ridiculously corny now guys, but consider the time it was made in, consider the regressiveness which prevailed in Hindi cinema some 12 years back. Factor in all this and watch it from the heart, it's one of those rare gems in the rom-com genre which has sustained for this long!",

It gave me hope that one must live his life to the fullest as might be we cant get this moment to live again. The acting of Sharukh Khan is best in the movie.

One element predominant in most Bollywood movies isn't missing: love. It's a beautiful, multi-layered love story and, to use the clich\u00e9, very much a \"feel good\" movie. It has wonderful music and fun dance numbers. Have tissues handy, however, because despite some extremely funny moments, it is also sad. There are great acting performances as well. Shah Rukh Khan shows just why he is not only a box office favorite nearly worldwide, but that he's also a solid actor.",

Meanwhile Johar(producer) and Advani(director) develop the storyline subtly by sneaking in drama which adds spice to the proceedings and paves the way for a dramatic and emotional climax.It is a wonderful film about living life and enjoying the days we have because we don't know what tomorrow will bring. Aman (Shahrukh khan) the main leading actor falls in love with Naina Catherine Kapoor (Preity Zinta) who belongs to a Punjabi family, she is not married and have no intentions to be. Shahrukh Khan later find out in the movie that he has a heart disease and would not be able to live for long. So he never tells Naina that he loves her instead of that he hooked Naina with her best friend Said Ali Khan whose a total flirt but later on fells in love with Naina too..I cried a lot when i watched this movie in the theater I was crying the whole time but enjoyed it a lot!

Naina takes night classes for her MBA and that is where she meets her best friend Rohit. Rohit sort of thinks he is a ladies man but he is definitely not the ladies man that he thinks he is. Naina's family has been having a hard time ever since her father died and her mother and grandmother do not get along very well and their family restaurant is struggling. Her family prays for an angel and that is when Aman shows up and changes all of their lives. Naina is played by the always lovable  Preity ZInta and Shah Rukh Khan is just as charming as ever in his role of Aman. This film takes you on a roller coaster of emotional ups and downs. It will make you laugh and it will make you cry but it leaves you with a sense of warmth in the end. \n\nThis film has some more realistic sets than Shah Rukh Khan's other movie Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham. While that movie was all about amplifying all the aspects of Bollywood, this film definitely stays a little more on the realistic side, at least as much as a Bollywood movie can. The huge elaborate sets and parties and dance numbers from Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham are replaced with song sequences and dance numbers in the street and while fixing the family restaurant. While Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham is more over the top in everything, Kal Ho Naa Ho is less over the top but more ridiculous in some of the comedy aspects. They break the 4th wall often and there are many witty and laughable moments throughout while still creating a heartfelt story. However, as with most Bollywood movies, there is an elaborate wedding scene. As Rachel Dwyer discusses in her article \"Yeh Shaadi Nahin Ho Sakti! (\"This Wedding Cannot Happen!\"): Romance and Marriage in Contemporary Hindi Cinema\", \"[t]he wedding is a major spectacle\". She also discusses how weddings in film show the ideal wedding and the wedding scenes are full of expensive clothes, lots of decor, and of course song and dance. Although Kal Ho Naa Ho overall is not as elaborate as some other movies such as Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham, the wedding scene is no less elaborate than any other wedding scene as it is truly spectacular. \n\nOverall, Kal Ho Naa Ho is a very lovely movie to watch full of emotion, love, beauty, family, and of course lots of catchy songs and fun dancing.\n\nCitations\n(Un)tying the Knot: Ideal and Reality in Asian Marriage.

            "content": "Kal Ho Na Ho tells the story of a dramatic love triangle shadowed by death, family conflicts, and friendship. The film stars Preity Zinta, Saif Ali Khan, Shahrukh Khan, and Jaya Bachchan. Preity Zinta plays Naina, a pessimistic MBA student from an Indian family living in Queens New York with her widowed mother, biological brother, adopted sister, and cynical grandmother. Her life is constantly shadowed by her family's financial problems, her father's suicide, and her grandmother's spitefulness towards her sister Gia. All this changes when Aman (played by Shahrukh Khan) moves next door. He quickly captivates Naina's family and she slowly falls for him. Although he rejects Naina's love, he pledges to help her best friend Rohit win her affection. While the film touches on many grave topics, it is ultimately fun and light hearted. The song sequences are modern and catchy and include inspiration from genres such as rock and disco. They show how Aman is able to bring a fun and optimistic atmosphere to the other characters of the film. The sets of the film are colorful and vibrant in their depiction of Queens and Manhattan. The costumes complement each set perfectly and depict  a range of attire from casual athletic clothes to bright red dresses and expensive suits. The film embraces the best of Bollywood in a modern setting. \n\nThis is similar to Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham another film written by Karan Johar. Sangita Gopal writes in her novel Bollywood and Globalization that Karan Johar films rely on elaborate musical numbers, melodrama, and big starcast. This is certainly true of both films. Kal Ho Na Ho particularly relies on melodrama to move the audience and keep them on the edge of their seats, trying to figure out who Naina will end up with. Its unique love triangle shows how passionate love can be both romantic and friendly and how quickly it can change from one to the other. I found Kal Ho Na Ho to be a fantastic film which kept me on the edge of my seat. It made me laugh, cry, smile, and frown. I would highly recommend it to both returning and new Bollywood fans.\n\nCitations \n\nMehta, R., & Pandharipande, R. (Eds.). (2010).

I say so because one of them claims that the leads have 'good singing voices'. That person obviously doesn't watch any bollywood movies, otherwise they would know that they are simply lip syncing rather than singing.\r (NO spoilers)\rKal Ho Naa Ho has an admittedly slow start, and the only thing that seems to keep it going for the first 15 to 20 minutes is Shahrukh Khan's character, Aman, and his shenanigans, but the movie quickly picks up pace as the viewer begins to realize Aman is hiding something, and leads to a startling realization. This is where SRK shines: this movie beautifully showcases his ability to both wrench your heart and entertain you, and not once does he slip up. Preity Zinta and Saif Ali Khan also do amazingly well at both acting and leaving a good impression on the audience, and it gives the viewer empathy towards the characters, which is what ultimately makes the ending of this movie so strong.\r While most people simply try to get through the songs in a bollywood movie, I found myself thoroughly enjoying the dance numbers and mini-plots in this movie's songs, and the voices of the singers are absolutely amazing as well. Watch for a special appearance by Rani Mukherjee and Kajol.\r The thing that really brings this movie home is it's amazing script, and how well the actors and actresses are able to portray their characters without going over the top, which is difficult to do with character as these.
