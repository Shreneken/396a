            "content": "There are people out there who will greenlight anything! That is the only explanation I can offer as to why the House of the Dead movie exists. And that's only scary part to the whole movie. It's so bad you'll go off movies forever. I seriously wanted to switch this off and turn the TV over to the Paint Drying channel but I was bound by my word to suffer the whole thing. I don't know why I do these bad things to myself.As if it matters, here's the basic jist of the 'story'. A group of twenty-somethings are so desperate to go out to some island in the Pacific Northwest (Canada actually, because it's cheap) for the 'Rave of the Century' (which consists of about 8 people and un-raving music) that they pay some craggy old fisherman $1000 to take them there after they miss the main ferry. That's gotta be some rave to be worth all that dough! The fisherman warns them that the island is also known as the Island of the Dead (hang on-I thought this was HOUSE of the Dead?) and that they are all doomed yadda yadda yadda.First faults here. Why would a tiny little rave (of the Century my foot!) be held on some remote island? Why would anyone willingly pay loads of money to get it? Why pay even more to the craggy old fisherman to take them back when they could just come back with the others?Once they arrive they discover that the rave (which consists of about 2 tents, a small stage and a port-a-john) has been smashed, there's blood everywhere and no one is around. What would any rationally thinking person do? Run for their lives of course. But no, these clueless, obviously blind people decide to go look for them. Soon enough they discover an old ramshackle house that's 50 times as big on the inside as it is on the outside. Another half hour of stumbling around in the forest follows, as an excuse to kill of some of the lesser characters, and after much tedium they arrive back at the house again. The characters, like the movie, go nowhere.Jammed into this ghastly disaster is a superabundance of gibberish dialogue, heinous acting, mumbo-jumbo exposition and zillions of clips from the once-popular arcade game of the same name. Why this was universally accepted as a good idea with the filmmakers I'll never know. The clips have no reference to any of the scenes and only degrade this trash even further, if that is at all possible.It has nothing to do with the game save for some cheap, throwaway line at the end. It makes Resident Evil look like cinematic glory. Hell, even the Double Dragon movie seems multi-Oscar worthy in comparison to this junk. The only one who comes out of this with his dignity still intact is Jurgen Prochnow. He could have just taken his money and ran but he tries his best with the awful script and brings a tiny bit of pathos to his character. The rest of the cast suck I'm afraid. The characters are idiots and deserve to die.Plus, if you cut out the swearing and pointless nudity, I see no reason why this film cannot be shown on Saturday morning TV. It's not frightening in the slightest. Pirates of the Caribbean is more scary than the skeletal bad guys in this film. And where did all those bad guys come from anyway? There were only a few people on the island to begin with. I guess this justifies the reason they chose to reuse footage over and over. I kid you not, you'll see the same zombie die a dozen times.Who's ultimately to blame for that scandalous waste of celluloid? None other than director Uwe Boll. His control over the movie is non-existent. You can clearly the see actors have no idea what they should be doing and that the zombies aren't really taking it all seriously. The actors seem like they're reading off cue cards as they constantly pause in the middle of long sentences and carry on talking as soon as they see the next card. It all feels very unnatural.Plus the film is shot like a two-part mini-series. I have indeed seen better TV productions. And don't get me started on the editing. The film is an incoherent babble with thousands upon thousands of pointless shots and dozens of meaningless camera pans. No real skill or talent was put into making this at all. It truly baffles and boggles the mind how movies this unfathomably bad can get made and George A. Romero can't even get anyone to take his calls. House of the Dead makes some idiotic reference to Romero in a lazy attempt to be 'post-modern' but it only irritates that they think THIS is in the same league as a REAL zombie movie.For what it's worth, the 1.85:1 anamorphic picture looks great and the Dolby 5.1 soundtrack is clean but very unimpressive and only serves to pronounce the heavily over-used ADR even more. The DVD comes with extras but why torture yourself. Isn't this review warning enough? Stay away! You are all doomed I tell you! Doomed! Doomed!!!",

            "content": "There are some movies you just know they are going to be bad from frame one. Even if you were totally oblivious of Ed Wood's work, one look at that commentator from \"Plan 9 from outer space\" and you just KNOW you are not gonna see the next cinematic masterpiece. Just like that, when I saw the first shot of Uwe Bolls masterpiece \"House of Dead\", with that guy sitting at the front of the house starting his introduction while trying desperately to sound like he just arrived from Sin City, I knew I'm in for a helluva ride.So, the movie starts like this - first the lead character says that everybody else is going to die. You know, to keep you wandering. Then he starts introducing the rest of the characters with lines like \"Karma..thinks she's Foxy Brown\" or \"Alicia..my ex.. we broke up recently.. I had to study and she had to fence\". No, I'm not kidding.Anyway, this bunch of 20-somethings who couldn't act their way out of a wet paper-bag are going to the \"Rave of the century\", rave in question being a few tents, a port-a-potty and a shoddy stage located on small island in the middle of the Pacific. Our gang missed the ferry, but thankfully will find a way to get there, the way being a fisher-boat ran by Kirk (Cpt Kirk? Get it? Man, whoever wrote this script is a genius) and his sidekick who is a bastard child of Simpsons' Cpt McAllister and that hook killer who knows what you did last summer.To make the long story short, the gang gets to the island, finds nobody there except some bloody T-shirts and then decide to run the hell away from there. No wait, they do not, they actually get all happy and like cos there's free booze.With that scene the movie hits rock bottom and then against all odds proceeds to go further downhill. Some guys in rubber suits start running around, there is some screaming and shooting, our gang goes to some house to meet some other gang, they go out of the house, meet Cpt Kirk and some police woman (who between them have about 500 pounds of weapons) and then decide to go back to the house. Somewhere along the line they transform into a S.W.A.T. team, enter the Matrix, the rubber-suit guys start multiplying like bacteria and I start to cry because I actually paid to see this. To add insult to the injury, every few minutes there are shots from the video game this crap is based on and there is a cute game-over cut-scene for a few characters when they die.I seriously hate this movie. It doesn't even fit in that famed \"So bad it's good\" category. It's just plain bad. The script is bad, the zombies are awful, there is no tension, lines are bad, actors are bad.. the list just goes on.You will probably want to see this movie just because of its reputation of being awful. Don't. There are bad movies that deserve to be watched. This is not one of them.",

My friend unwittingly bought this piece of garbage (not a compliment this time) and we stumbled into watching one of the most excruciating wastes of celluloid EVER! When hearing that Dave \"Dead Hate the Living!\" Parker was to write this, I figured he would provide the fulfillment to go with the ever-so-slight promise I believed I saw in him earlier on. Maybe it was or wasn't his screw-up, but this is just unbelievable. How horrid can a movie get? A dumbass with a video camera (sign of the artist!) makes self-referential quips about Romero films to let you know it's supposed to be a real, bona fide throwback. When various characters die, it's made to look as if they've lost a video game. See actual video game footage spliced into action scenes that make Ed Wood, Jr. look superior! And, no, it's not funny because IT IS THAT DAMN BAD. Everything about it, everything! What a shambles! And don't make the mistake of thinking getting high will help you enjoy it... we WASTED our high on this piece of slimy maggot excrement!

The actors appear to be reading off cue cards and do the dumbest things. Such as being chased by dead people but yet wanting to go out and look for their friends. Also the zombies were terrible, no where near as fun as any of Romero's work, who gets s plug in the movie. And the dumbest part of all was they kept showing flashes of the video game in the action sequences. Like we don't get the video game is about shooting zombies. Also, all the 20 somethings some how know how to use automatic weapons and hit a target without even aiming the gun. And the way the people die is so stupid. It's like they run out of ammo so stand around waiting to be jumped on. And when cornered in front of the house they run out of ammo instead of shooting the door open, So dumb.FINAL VERDICT: If any of these actors appear in another film, then they've been blessed with a second chance. Definitely the worst film I've seen in years. A B-movie on cinemax is better.",

            "content": "Laid up and drugged out, as a kidney stone wended its merry way through my scarred urinary tract, with absolutely nothing better to do than let the painkillers swoon me into semi-oblivion, I happened to catch this movie on cable. I wouldn't want anyone to think that I paid to view it in a cinema, or rented it, or \u0096 heaven forfend! \u0096 that I watched it STRAIGHT.Having played this sensationally gruesome video game and avidly trod the doomed rooms and dread passageways of The House, battling Chariot (Type 27), The Hanged Man (Type 041), and other impossible sentinels, my curiosity was piqued as to how the game would transfer to the movie screen.It doesn't.The banal plot revolves around a group of \"crazy kids\" \u0096 a la Scooby Doo \u0096 attending a remote island for a world-shaking \"rave\" \u0096 whatever that is. (You kids today with your hula-hoops and your mini-skirts and your Pat Boone\u0085) After bribing a boat captain thousands in cash to ferry them there (a stupidity which begs its own network of rhetoric), they find the \"rave\" deserted.Passing mention is made of a \"house\" \u0096 presumably the titular House Of The Dead \u0096 but most of the action takes place on fake outdoor sets and other locales divorced from any semblance of haunted residence.A fallen video camera acts as flashback filler, showing the island in the throes of a \u0096 party?! Is that it? Oh, so this \"rave\" thingy is just a \"party\"? In the grand tradition of re-euphemizing \"used cars\" as \"pre-owned\", or \"shell shock\" as \"post-traumatic stress disorder\", the word \"party\" is now too square for you drug-addled, silicone-implanted, metrosexual jagoffs? It is learned that the party was broken up by rampaging zombies. Intelligent thought stops here\u0085I don't think the pinheads who call themselves screenwriters and directors understand the mythos behind zombie re-animation. Zombies can't die \u0096 they're already UN-DEAD. They do not bleed, they know no pain. Unless their bodies are completely annihilated, they will continue being animated. At least, that's what my Jamaican witch priestess tells me.Which means that a .45 shot into their \"hearts\" is not going to stop them, nor will a machete to the torso. And a shotgun blast to the chest will certainly NOT bring forth gouts of blood. At least in the video game's logic, the shooter pumps so many rounds into each monster that it is completely decimated, leaving a fetid mush that cannot re-animate itself.Yet each actor-slash-model gets their Matrix-circular-camera moment, slaying zombies on all fronts with single bullets and karate chops to the sternum. Seriously, these zombies are more ineffective than the Stormtroopers from \"Return Of The Jedi\", who get knocked out when Ewoks trip them.I suppose the film's writer, Mark Altman, having penned the not-too-shabby \"Free Enterprise\", felt compelled to insert a Captain Kirk reference, in the character of Jurgen Prochnow, who must have needed milk money desperately to have succumbed to appearing in this aromatic dung-swill. There is also a reference to Prochnow's primo role in the magnificent \"Das Boot\", when one of the untrained B-actors mentions that he \"looks like a U-Boat Captain\". \". I wonder how many of this movie's target audience of square-eyed swine picked up on ANY of the snide references to other films, as when Prochnow declares, \"Say hello to my little friend\", presaging his machine gun moment. Aimed at a demographic who have not the wherewithal to comprehend the Sisyphean futility of the video-game concept (i.e. the game ends when you die \u0096 you cannot win), this is merely a slasher film for the mindless and mindless at heart. Accordingly, everyone dies in due course, except for a heterosexual pair of Attractive White People.A better use for this film's scant yet misused budget might have been to send the cast through Acting School, although Ona Grauer's left breast did a good job, as did her right breast \u0096 and those slomo running scenes: priceless! I especially liked the final scene with Ona trying to act like she's been stabbed, but looking like she's just eaten ice cream too fast.Attempting to do something more constructive with my time, I pulled out my Digitally-Restored, 35th Anniversary, Special Edition, Widescreen Anamorphic DVD of \"Manos: The Hands Of Fate.\" Ah, yes! \u0096 the drugs were suitably brain-numbing - now HERE was some quality film-making\u0085(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)",

            "content": "Okay, so I'm not a big video game buff, but was the game House of the Dead really famous enough to make a movie from? Sure, they went as far as to actually put in quick video game clips throughout the movie, as though justifying any particular scene of violence, but there are dozens and dozens of games that look exactly the same, with the hand in the bottom on the screen, supposedly your own, holding whatever weapon and goo-ing all kinds of aliens or walking dead or snipers or whatever the case may be.It's an interesting premise in House of the Dead, with a lot of college kids (LOADED college kids, as it were, kids who are able to pay some fisherman something like $1,500 just for a ride after they miss their boat) trying to get out to this island for what is supposed to be the rave of the year. The first thing that comes to mind about House of the Dead after watching it is that it has become increasingly clear that modern horror movies have become nothing more than an exercise in coming up with creative ways to get a lot of scantily clad teenagers into exactly the same situations. At least in this case, the fact that they were on their way to a rave excuses the way the girls are dressed. They look badly out of place running around the woods in cute little halter-tops, but at least they THOUGHT they were dressed for the occasion.Clint Howard, tellingly the most interesting character in the film by far, delivers an absolutely awful performance, the greatness of which overshadows every other actor in the movie. I can't stand it when well-known actors change their accents in movies, it is so rarely effective, and Howard here shows that it is equally flat to have an well-known actor pretend that he's this hardened fisherman with a raspy voice from years of breathing salty air. He didn't even rasp well. It sounded like he was eating a cinnamon roll before shooting and accidentally inhaled some powdered sugar or something. Real tough there, Clint! I expected more from him, but then again, he did agree to a part in this mess.Once we get to the island, the movie temporarily turns into any one of the Friday the 13th movies that took place at Camp Crystal Lake. Lots of teenagers played by actors who were way too old for their parts getting naked and then killed. The nudity was impressive, I guess, but let's consider something for a minute. These kids pay almost two grand to get out to this island to go to the Rave Of The Year, find NO ONE, and say, well, who wants a beer! Even the guy who pulled that stack of hundreds out of his wallet to get them all over there didn't think anything of it that they found a full bar and not a single solitary person in sight. Here you have the input from director Uwe Boll - There's alcohol! They won't notice that the party they came for consists of no one but themselves!So not only do they start drinking, not minding the fact that the whole party seems to have vacated the island, but when one of the girls goes off into the dark woods to find out where everyone is (dragging one other girl and one of the guys reluctantly along), the guy and the girl who stay behind to get smashed decide that it would be a great idea to strip down for a quickie now that they're alone. It's like they expected to find the island empty, and now that they rest of the people that they came over with were gone for a little while, they would have some privacy since there's no one else around. Brilliant!Now for the things that everyone hated, judging by the reviews that I've read about the movie. Yes, intersplicing shots from the video game into the movie, mostly in order to show that, yes, the movie was being faithful to/directly copying the video game. Sure, it was a stupid idea. I can't imagine who thought up that little nugget, but worse than that is the Matrix-style bullet time scenes that were thrown in over and over and over and over. After the first time (at which point I found it pretentious and cheesy for a movie like this to have a shot like that as though it was something original) it is noticeable more for the technique of the shot itself rather than any dramatic meaning or creation of any kind of tension for the film.One of the things that makes a zombie film scary and gets you on the edge of your seat is to have them slowly but relentlessly coming after the living humans, who are much faster but getting tired, running out of places to run, and with a terrifying shortage of things with which to fight the zombies off with. The first two are done right in the movie, the kids are terrified and don't have a lot of places to run since they're on an island, but since they caught a ride over with a smuggler, they find themselves heavily armed. And I mean that very strongly. I mean, these people have everything from machine guns to hand grenades, which removes most of the tension of the impending walking dead.Then you have what I call the techno-slasher scene. Since the rave never happened, and I guess since Uwe Boll thought people were going to be disappointed at not hearing any techno music in the movie, there's one scene right in the middle where all the humans are fighting off the living dead, and amazingly enough it turns into something of a music video. There's techno music blasting as the shots are edited together faster and faster until it's nothing but a blur of gory shot, mostly only about 5 frames long (which is about 1/6 of a second) flashing across the screen in time with the speed techno music. Clever, I guess, but it has no place in a horror movie because it completely removes any sense of scariness or tension of even the gross-out effect because you can't see any one thing for long enough to react to it. You're just watching these shots fly across the screen and wondering what the hell the director was thinking when he decided that it would be a good idea to put something like this in the movie.\nI've seen a lot of people compare this movie to Resident Evil, mostly claiming that it copies the premise of it, and they're exactly right. I appreciate that at least here, as was not the case in Resident Evil, it wasn't some man-made virus that turned people into walking dead that were able to infect other people, changing them the way vampires turn others into vampires. 28 Days Later was also clearly an inspiration for this movie, it's just too bad that House of the Dead didn't do a single original thing, except for the somewhat moronic idea of putting in quick shots of the video game on which it is based, just in case you forget. I really think that this should have been a much better movie. While obviously I can't say that I know much about the game it's based on, just the title and the movie poster deserve a much better movie, but unfortunately I think that's more often the case than not with horror movies. It's really kind of sad when a movie comes out that is so obviously advertised as a no-holds-barred horror film, and the scariest thing in the entire movie is the closing shot, which suggests the possibility of a sequel.",

All I know for sure is that this is a dumb film....no, it's an offensive and dumb film. Everyone in the film seems vacuous and worthless--with dialog and actions that constantly reaffirm this. Their greatest interests in life are partying, cursing and taking off their clothes...period. So, when they all start to get killed off like in a Friday the 13th film, you really could care less.This incredibly obnoxious and unsubtle film was, not surprisingly, made by Uwe Boll--the man responsible for many films based on video games. So, we have perhaps the worst living film director AND a film based on a video game...does it get any worse than this?! Viewers are treated to lots of blood and gore, many explicit scenes of vomiting and girls who take their clothes off for absolutely no reason. The latter is really weird, as the film was filmed in the Pacific Northwest--and people all were wearing jackets and long sleeve shirts--yet, in this bizarro world, girls just gotta rip off their clothes in some of the most gratuitous scenes you could imagine. Perhaps ut even then it might make sense if this were a porn video...a bad porn video. Instead, this crap was marketed mostly to teens and stupid people.The plot, for what it is, is very simple. A group of vacuous and horny young adults(?) take a boat to a party on an island known as \"the Isle of Death\" for some sex and alcohol. Instead, people start turning into zombies and ripping each other to pieces. Yet, inexplicably, many of the prey know cool martial arts skills OR turn out to have high-tech weapons with inexhaustible supplies of bullets!!! The dumbest is the captain of a crappy fishing boat--who suddenly sports a high-powered rifle with a scope and laser!!!! What the heck?!? Overall, it's a movie with all action that's set to a loud Euro-pop beat. There is nothing in the way of plot, acting or caricatures---just zombies, cursing, nudity and death. If you LIKE the idea of a virtually plot less film with no acting or writing--just zombies, death and annoying music, then this movie is for you. Otherwise, it's a waste of time and clearly deserving its place on IMDb's Bottom 100 list.",

From Romero's 'Dead' trilogy to '28 days later.' However upon watching it, you can quickly see what this movie really is.It is actually a music video that goes progressively faster and gets more and more and more gory. There is no horror here folks. Just some half-way decently staged action scenes which soon grow tiresome because they last... and last... and last... and soon you get the feeling maybe you're DVD player accidentally skipped back 3 minutes, but no, this is how they actually made the movie. It's a pity. I think anyone could find a better use for $7 million dollars in the movie industry than make this lump o' crud. Though some of the 360 effects were cool, but once again, they were over used and grew tedious since it was the same stunt over and over again each time, just with a different character.Also what is ROYALLY annoying is the splicing on of footage from the arcade game. I've played the game. It sucks. So why did they put it in here?

This however, is pure crap. Terrible dialogue, half-assed plot, and video game scenes inserted into the film. Who in their right mind thought that was a good idea. The only thing about this movie (I use the term loosely) that I enjoyed was Jurgen Prochnow as Captain Kirk (Ugh). While his name throws originality out the window, you can see in his performance that he knows he's in a god awful film and he might as well make the best of it. Everyone else acts as if they're doing Shakespeare. And very badly I might add. Basically the only reason anyone should see this monstrosity is if you a.)

Plot line is this: A group of ravers travel to an island near Seattle, an island known as Isla del Morte (Island of the dead, and my Spanish spelling is likely incorrect). Once they arrive, they find the biggest rave of the year deserted. Why? they find out once they stumble upon survivors and are shown video footage of what happened. This is really an elementary movie, poorly written by Mark Altman (who did one of my favorite films, \"Free Enterprise\") and equally poorly acted by the mainly unknown cast. Along with Jurgen Prochnow, Ellie Cornell (\"Halloween\" 4 & 5) and Clint Howard (Ron's brother) are the only names I recognized. I really don't expect much from Clint (and he certainly delivered in that area) but Ellie and Jurgen usually do a little better than they showed here.Johnathan Cherry is really dull as Rudy, Tyron Leitso's Simon is an irritating little weasel, Ona Grauer's Alicia is really nice to look at, but not much else...so on and so forth.Lots and lots of pop culture references, including a mention of George A. Romero and the possibility of a 4th \"Dead\" film. See this one if you're a Romero fan...please...its a zombie movie and if the industry thinks thats what we want, then we'll get George's final vision that much sooner. This is just not a good movie, but if you're like me and enjoy giving the \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\" treatment to bad films, you should see this one. 1/2 out of 5",

            "content": "*SPOILER ALERT* *SPOILER ALERT*My dad and I went out to see this one. I knew I was in for something special when the guy at the box office looked surprised when we said, \"Two for \"House of the Dead\" please.\" He had a bewildered look on his face but gave us two tickets and mumbled the usual, \"Enjoy your movie.\" We went up to the ticket taker, she tore our tickets and said, \"Theater 4 to your right.\" It was then that I understood. Theater 4 is where they send the really special films, the ones where they are shocked and surprised when a human being pays to see it. Sure enough, there was NO ONE in the theater but me and dad. One guy shuffled in for ten minutes and left. He must have been looking for \"Kill Bill\".The game makers saw the financial results of \"Resident Evil\", got excited, greenlit their version of it and added an overdose of \"Matrix\" effects to create \"House of the Dead\". So a bunch of morons head to a rave on an island. Zombies appear and the morons shoot them. The end. That's it. There's nothing else. Shows over. Finish your popcorn and get out. Beat it.\n\"House of the Dead\" lived up to Theater 4's long standing tradition of B-movie ineptness. It's the kind of flick you think you should be enjoying a lot more than you are. There's blood, guts, zombies, a couple of topless women and guns. Lots of guns. So what's not to like? Well, if you stop and think about the incredible lack of logic, you'll probably hate this movie. My advice: Don't think. Watch zombies go boom, splat, ugh. Take the blood and naked breasts and kick back. Any thinking will ruin the movie.\nMercenaries with cameras made this movie. They were hired by the game makers to advertise their video game product. \"House of the Dead\": One long, bloody commercial. There is even a SEGA banner hanging over the rave scene just so you know who's throwing this party. Whenever there was a scene change, images from the actual game would pop up. Just when you thought the movie couldn't be any more shameless, it shocks you again.I sincerely hope the makers of this film sent some flowers and candy to the makers of \"The Matrix\" because they were completely in love with their \"Bullet Time\" technology. Shameless again. The only original thought this movie had was to add screen shots of the game into the film. At least it was honest about its intentions: Sell, sell, sell! Buy \"House of the Dead\"! The game is more fun! Don't you wish you were playing it? Like...RIGHT NOW?!!",

After watching it I do agree that it is crap, the movie had no story. In the first 15-20 minutes there was nothing but topless teenage girls with no brains running about (for a moment there I was wondering are the zombies brain-dead? or the girls are?) then at night time the zombies popped out of nowhere & started attacking people later a woman started shooting them I mean it takes you one place then the other every 5 minutes. Is it supposed to be a comedy?, or horror? or both? Before I knew it I fell asleep at the second half & woke up during the end credits so I did not manage to watch all of it, which is a good thing! The film is a true insult to the classic game, Uwe Boll please do not make any more films. Thank you!",

It's been sad learning about the decline of arcade games, but these were games that I always had fond memories of from my teenage years. I just spent that much time in the theater. I hope they didn't even have this in the arcade of theaters that actually showed this movie. This is in my top ten worst films of all time. I had heard so much about Uwe Boll and was interested in at least seeing what he had done. This is the guy who actually beat up people (in boxing matches) who hated his movies.Honestly, I could challenge him seeing as how I have so much rage for him. The most insufferable thing about this film was probably how it contained stock footage from the actual games. I mean, they just randomly show this footage over and over and it's only one or two seconds long. What's incredible is that this movie has absolutely nothing to do with the games at all. You could literally remove the footage and no one would know it was a movie based on \"House Of The Dead\". I mean, I would think that if you included stock footage from the actual thing that you're basing your movie on, you would know what the game was about! It's the worst zombie movie ever made.I heard this movie had one of the highest movie body counts, but it doesn't matter. In one long scene, they just show these monotonous horrible slow motion scenes over and over with all these terrible angles. The main character even flashes back to a bunch of scenes that just happened! It's about this island with zombies on it that's hard to get to. How can it be hard to get to when we see all these ravers there? There's a huge \"Sega\" sign begin displayed. It was as if this movie needed to remind you that it was based on a Sega game. It's more like useless product placement.The movie ends with the main villain appearing and saying that he uses zombie blood or something so he can live forever. Wha...? This has the most random plot lines I've ever heard of. The budget looks terrible, looking more like a TV movie than a theatrically released film. Well, this the worst movie I've seen for Video Game Month and one of the worst ever. I still have a lot more Uwe Boll movies to watch! Remember, he literally said that he was \"the only genius in this whole f**king business\" (his actual words). Let's hope he never gets his hands on Mega Man. Zero stars",

Turn the channel NOW to save your sanity and lock the doors since the world is obviously ending when we have run out of garbage to put on TV and are reduced broadcasting this crap..But don't worry.. we edited out the language so your sensitive ears won't ever hear profanity!!!!..

STOP GIVING HIM MONEY to make movies!!!FFS Pay him to NOT make movies and we will all be better off!!Seriously!!!!This pathetic excuse for a movie is just abysmal.. and while I've worked in the industry and am prod of some of the good stuff we have done here in Canada.. this is NOT one of them and the fact he was even allowed into the country to film this is worthy of investigation since it's an abomination to our film industry and whomever issued him the permits needed needs to be fired!!!So review boiled down for those that want to skip to the end:To quote the great Monty Python:RUN AWAY!!!!

It is funny that movies love to get inspiration from video games instead of trying to recreate the video game's plot. I really don't understand.Anyway. I'm ok with trash movies. Sometimes they are acceptable, sometimes they are even masterpieces. This movie is none. It's complete trash with plank acting and nonsense. Characters are just plain dumb and stereotypical.

I know nobody was expecting high art, but even within it's meagre aspirations, there are still some pretty glaring flaws.For starters, it's hilariously dated. From the aggressive techno soundtrack, to the fashion, to the insistence on some very of the time visual effects, especially that good 'ol Matrix style slow mo bullet bit. It's also from the last era to put such blatant sexism on full display, to call the nudity in this gratuitous is an understatement.It barely has any connection to the arcade game outside of the zombie theme, and tries to make up for this by including gameplay footage, which is the most ridiculously tacky thing since that first Doom movie did a whole scene first person shooter style.To top it off, the whole thing just looks really cheap and generally has the feel of a made for TV movie.

If you get your film inspiration from your favorite arcade game, then maybe your in the wrong field. Three story credits are listed for what seems like a kinderg\u00e4rtners project.

The lighting is ineffective also, even for a movie of this genre it is too austere, and the scenery I just couldn't enjoy as a result. The music is loud and over-bearing, starting sluggish in tempo and then rushing on for no real reason. The script is full of overlong and quite frankly lazy exposition, repetitive rhetoric and dialogue that comes across as hackneyed and trite. The pop culture references especially feel thrown in and add absolutely nothing to the actually non-existent atmosphere The story is a mess, what there is is predictable and lethargic with nothing standing out as scary or suspenseful, a lot of it reads of a rambling music video with a cheap attempt to evoke some horror. The direction is incompetent, not surprising considering it's Uwe Boll, whose reputation for making bad movies is notorious. The characters are stereotypical, have absolutely no depth to them and are not likable at all, more annoying above all else. The acting ranges from bland to irritating, nothing better.

I guess it's okay to see this thing if you want to make fun of a movie, but it's not a scary horror film by any means.  What's really sad is that the director seemed to want to ape Fulci's Zombie and maybe a touch of the classic Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things, but sadly, he didn't know how to do that and was well out of his league trying.

It's worse than the 90210 stars trying to say they're still teens and attempt to play the old \"bopper\" roles. Another thing that struck me as odd is the genre is titled \"horror\". Whose idea was this? I think Weird Al must have directed this movie or perhaps the director from the Scary Movie series. I say this sincerely as it seems someone was playing a farce with the movie and making a mockery of other films in the process. From the simple plot of zombies and teen sex (quite redundant today) to overactive camera shots emulating that of The Matrix, this movie aims at outrageousness. But maybe for some it is right up their alley and the director \"delivered the goods\". That is, of course, if you are looking for some low-budget wanna-be horror-film that presents idiot heroes, topless women, overnight Rambos, and a quick concocted old curse or some other explanation for the \"terror\". I think this is today's version of something like Attack of the Giant Spider, except of course that probably had much better acting. Oh, and as a \"added-bonus\", don't be surprised to see bizarre dub-ins from the video game. Just more backward comedy if you ask me.",

So this movie is directed by a bad director (MUCH worse than Ed Wood) and it's based on a awful video-game. Much worse than this???? The plot: some stupid and horny adults go on a island known as Isla de los Muertos (Island of the Dead) for having fun. But instead everyone turns into zombies and rips each other's skin. Yet with no explanation whatsoever the victims know martial arts and have always huge supplies of weapons for killing the blood-thirsty zombies. And Jurgen Prochnow is wasted as the boat Captain because his role is so underwritten that it comes off as awkward.There isn't really much plot - just zombies, cursing, nudity and violence. If you love this stuff then this is a movie perfect for you and you'll love it. But if you are NOT a horror fan (like me) and you like intelligent movies, you must steer clear from this dumb and obnoxious film that deserves to be on IMDB's Bottom 100 (at #7 place).",

They arrive to find out the entire rave has been attacked and killed by zombies...and they're next.  Or something like that.This movie is INCREDIBLY bad!!!!  ALL the acting is lousy--I mean EVERYBODY!!!!  There's not one good performance at all!  Also, one of the guys is described as being very handsome and being an underwear model. He's not handsome and (very obviously) is not in great shape.  They even cast the roles wrong!!!The movie does deserve some credit--within the first 15 minutes we see two topless women--one of them at great length.  Needless to say it has nothing to do with the plot.Oh--and the \"plot\"!  What little there is completely disappears by the last half hour.  At that point they're all baricadded in a house with the zombies all outside trying to get in.  What happens?  Out of nowhere, one of the women finds a book and says \"This is book is pretty old.  Maybe it can help us.\" (????!!!!!?????) WHAT THE F***!   At that point I almost left.  When a movie is insulting me like that... Really crappy zombie makeup too.  They only show it in flashes...for good reason.  When you get a clear view at the end it's laughable.  And what the hell is the point of showing video game killings every once in a while?  Yes...we KNOW it's based on a video game...you don't have to keep reminding us!Still, I sort of \"enjoyed\" it.  It was so bad in every department it was amusing to watch (kind of).  Also there's plentiful gore with some nice shots of heads exploding (the MPAA must have been asleep when they rated this one) and there's a (I swear) 10-15 minute non-stop massacre sequence in the middle that is both incredibly gory and hysterically funny (the director slows motion down at random and stops it to circle every single character...WHY???????).  This is a perfect party movie.  Rent it and you'll have the room laughing in minutes.One last note--when I saw it 7 people were in the theatre--3 walked out. And one guy said to his girlfriend while leaving, \"There are some bad movies but that was the WORST!\"  I give it a 1--I wish I could go lower!",

With the success of Resident Evil fresh in the memory of Hollywood, someone obviously thought that films based on video games were now the in thing. Never mind, of course, that Resident Evil was given a halfway decent story, good realisation, and a credible cast. No, video game-based films are suddenly fashionable, so we don't need those things, right? Well, the four production companies behind this mess obviously thought so. They were wrong. Dead wrong, if you'll pardon the pun.You might want to stop reading now if you want to be surprised by the incredible stupidity of this film. Anyway, our principal characters get an invite to some kind of party that is on an island that most mariners need to be paid incredible sums to think about visiting. The party organisers have transport, but it gets worse from this point.What defies belief is that brief snippets of footage from the video game are inserted throughout the film. Yes, we know this dross is based on a video game, we don't need screenshots from said game to remind us of the fact. Another thing they copied from the video game was the convoluted excuse for the partygoers and other incredibly stupid specimens to be on the island. What's even more incredible is how the heroes suddenly display skills that the audience haven't been made privy to. Suddenly, the afro girl can do kung fu with the zombies, and the previously green partygoers are wielding swords. One of the girls can even sustain wounds that would be fatal to men who have spent most of their lives building their muscular system. Don't ask me how she does it. I'm sure even the writers in this case don't know.A big part of the problem is that nothing shown in the film is given the appropriate level of setup. We don't know why these people are going to the island, smuggling things, or trying to arrest each other. They're just doing these incredibly stupid things. The dynamics of the zombies are not clearly defined, either. We're never given any explanation as to why they exist, or at least one that doesn't stretch credulity to breaking point. We get some drivel involving a Conquistador and some kind of experiment to prolong life, or something. Why anyone would have wanted to prolong their life in such a world begs for explanation. Explanation is apparently not in Uwe Boll's vocabulary.Spare a thought for J\u00fcrgen Prochnow. Appearing in this kind of Z-grade dreck is one hell of a comedown for the man who played the captain in Das Boot, the yardstick by which all submarine films are judged. I know he must be desperate to appear in anything after Judge Dredd, but this is just silly.I gave House Of The Dead a one out of ten. Don't mistake this to mean I think the film is bad enough to be good. It is so bad that it stops being good at about the halfway point and becomes excruciating.

When you can't help but bust out laughing at the sheer terrible nature of the trash littering your screen? \"House of the Dead\" struggles to achieve even this low graded level of cinema.From start to end \"House of the Dead\" manages to recreate the feeling like you've just woken up to find out that the cat has laid it's curled business neatly on your forehead while you slept. It is clear from the start that the female actors have been cast for their cleavage size (which they exploit shamelessly) whereas the males for their hardcore \"kick-ass\" attitude. I honestly did not care any of the characters for any moment of the film and found myself actually wishing their demise so as to spare me a good hour of this torture. Uwe Boll should have considered screening two hours of footage from the actual game as a movie. At least then we'll get better acting\u0085 However not all blame can be placed on the actors as it is certainly a challenge to produce a convincing film when faced with the script of this film. It is arguably the worst section of the film and actually contains such lines as: \"These are zombies, pure and simple\" and \"No cap'n, we must not go there! It's evil!\".We all know that Zombie movies are never going to be particularly thought provoking or full of meaning; at best they are a harmless two hours of action, blood and closet terror. Trash, yes, but entertaining trash. Not the kind of trash which bursts out of your bin bag as you haul it across the room and smothers your shoes in sour milk cartons and decaying banana skins. According to IMDb, \"House of the Dead\" received such bad reviews that no Danish cinemas bought the movie. If only we could have had the same privilege.Final Score: 1/10.",

            "content": "There's a massive rave happening on a jungle infested island that has a demented past. A group of teenagers who are running late hitch a ride on fishing boat and they arrived to find the scene completely deserted. Though, something isn't quite right as they find an abandon house where they discover some party-goers who claimed that they were attacked by some sort of zombies. Now it's up to this group of people to figure a way to get off the island or they shall meet an unpleasant demise from hordes of zombies.So, this is \"House of the dead\" and I just got to say it was just woefully incompetent schlock. I guess my curiosity just got the better of me when I saw it was playing on TV. While watching it, I thought it was on the music channel at times, as it mainly felt like an over-extended music clip. Director Uwe Boll's film is nothing but pretentious garbage and an incredibly lousy effort. It really has nothing going for it\u0085 well, it did have nice island scenery and fair makeup effects and a good amount of blood and gore. But these things couldn't carry this plain dreadful film. On show are paper-thin material and unlikeable characters. The actual lacklustre plot fails logic, it's filled with yawn inducing clich\u00e9s, even the back-story of these zombies is poorly setup and it ends with a diabolical finale. Though, what it sorely missed was humour! But then again it probably thought it was funny, but I just didn't see it. It felt like the film was actually taking itself rather serious and if so, well there you go. The performances are either wooden or atrocious and the characters are mundane and annoying. You just don't care for these hoons. There's even a young Bruce Campbell look alike, but he doesn't have the charisma or talent of that great actor. The dialogue is rather mindless drivel, which is filled with bad puns and mind numbing lines. It's nothing but tripe and stereotypical circumstances.The direction is just a muddle. Boll was trying too hard to make his film super coooool. Instead he lacked imagination in his execution, therefore making it super dull and uneventful. What else didn't help was the dumb editing of sequences of the actual video game to cut to new scenes. The score was mostly nonexistent, but not the damn techno soundtrack that pop up during the action scenes\u0085 my ears!!! It was just too much. When the techno music kicked in, so did the flashy camera-work that also got on my nerves. With its 360 degrees camera shots and shaky panning. Though, it was the slow-mows, which Boll centred on and really, it was not needed. It was just too distracting and rather lame. These action set pieces went on for far too long, which made it feel like everything was in slow-mow. What didn't help these moments was that no tension was generated and the action was mainly unexciting and pedestrian. No scares or thrills are evident. The romance sequences were just odd and rather laughable, with some characters finding love while battling zombies. A lot moments became a real drag because they dwelled on nothingness and too many sequences became really repetitive e.g. too many save yourself scenarios and a lot chasing about\u0085 I mean a lot! Some shots were actually used over and over again. Yes, this is a pointless and unsatisfying mess of a production. After seeing this film you'll be thinking what the hell was that?

            "content": "Another Uwe Boll video game adaptation means yet another inept effort at making a watchable film. This time we take what I'm sure is a heavily plotted, intelligent and character driven game that demanded a film adaptation (not really) and make it into a boring, generic zombie movie. It's \"House of the Dead\" people, and it sucks.The plot begins with a character informing us that he will be the only survivor. I love it when bad movies spoil their own endings, it's the equivalent a kid with no legs challenging a pro soccer player to a game. Simon (Tyron Leitso) introduces his soon-to-be-dead friends: Greg (Will Sanderson), Alicia (Ona Grauer), Karma (Enuka Okuma) and Xynthia (Sonya Salomaa, possibly playing some kind of alien that happens to look like a human). They want to go to an awesome rave party taking place on an island but little do they know, the place is overrun by zombies. Hitching a ride there by paying two smugglers (Jurgen Prochnow as Captain Victor Kirk and his first Mate Salish, played by Clint Howard) they are chased by a harbor police officer named Jordan Casper (Ellie Cornell). It's a struggle for survival and a struggle for the audience to resist falling asleep.The only good thing about this film is the makeup effects, which are actually pretty convincing. There's a huge army of zombies attacking our heroes and they come in all kinds of shapes and sizes. We've got aquatic zombies that can swim, moss-covered zombies that hide in the dirt, ancient skeletal zombies and even fresh zombies that basically look like regular people but with some blood all over them. If there's one good thing that could come out of this film, it's a recommendation to any aspiring horror filmmakers to hire the costume and makeup artists that were involved in this movie. Everything else is downright terrible.Not only does the movie drop the ball from the very beginning by telling us exactly who is going to make it out alive and who isn't but it commits the biggest sin in cinema \"show, don't tell\". We don't learn in any way that's organic who the main characters are, we are simply told exactly enough information to distinguish the actors from each other with exposition at the beginning of the movie. Considering the fact that the acting is pretty weak here, maybe it was a last minute decision by director Uwe Boll to avoid as many scenes of the actors talking as possible. Some would give props to the man, but I say next time, just hire real actors.The plot is utterly predictable, not only because we are told ahead of time what is going to happen (no, I will not let that go), but because it doesn't do anything new when it comes to the zombie horror genre. Basically every scene of people talking is just an excuse to tie together an accompanying scene where the humans are running away from or shooting at zombies. To remind us that this is a video game movie, and also presumably to obliterate any tension that might arise, the film constantly flashes to video game-y scenes. We've got clips of the game the film is based on, as well as \"game over\" type screens for some of the characters that end up biting the dust. I wish I could make up something as stupid as this. Can you imagine if someone re-edited \"Saving Private Ryan\" and called it \"Call of Duty\" by adding \"game over\" screens whenever someone was shot down? Even that movie, which is widely accepted as a masterpiece would be laughed out of theaters, so what chance does \"House of the Dead\" have with its undead-like acting abilities and paper-thin story? The movie can't even stay consistent because only some of the actors are dignified with a death screen. Meanwhile, we get 32 nearly-identical shots of polygon-based undead creatures getting shot in the face.It's never particularly scary and even if what the hacks in charge were aiming for was a horror-action movie, leaning more towards action it would still suck the big one. There's a big scene where all of the characters have found an ammo crate (get it? Like in a video game!) and suit up for battle. They make their way to the mysterious \"house of the dead\" and encounter a huge army of zombies. For a while, it's pretty cool to see. Our remaining heroes take down legions of undead using various weapons and fancy fighting moves but the scene drags on and on. It begins by being kind of cool (maybe because before then you were falling asleep) then becomes ridiculous and funny and finally ends by being totally boring.Even the ending of the movie ends in a big WTF moment that doesn't really make any sense. Even if you had the lowest standards imaginable, and I have been known to exhibit this illness, and basic zombie action with frequent moments of \"girls gone wild\" type nudity would interest you, the plot is so badly written, so poorly acted that there is no way you can enjoy yourself. I laughed at a moment where a party goer refused to go skinny dipping with a hot woman just so he could get killed by a zombie but like so many of Uwe Boll's films, you can't even enjoy this film ironically. It was a chore to get through and while I can, once again, praise the special effects, the surrounding story is terrible and you shouldn't waste your time with \"House of the Dead\".

One of the better features here is the rather impressive suspense built up here, whether done through the jungle location where it's all set up in the traditional gloomy, oppressive jungle shrubs that really give off a great vibe or the opening scenes of the chaos-riddled party that doesn't strike as being odd and off-the-wall enough to really warrant that kind of attention which pays off in a rather tense beginning. Compounding it all as well is the film's singular best quality in its relentless action that pretty much runs throughout the film as a whole, initially serving as the perfect payoff for the suspense-filled opening while offering up plenty of exciting moments. There's plenty of action here that starts off with the attacks in the forest filled with oncoming swarms of zombies that are appearing behind trees and underwater all along a rather fun and exciting series of chases and encounters. The main part of the excitement here is the centerpiece assault on the group as they race into the shack which is readily filled with tons of blasting gunshots, zombies heads blasts apart, limbs hacked off and martial arts moves all being utilized against the zombies in a delirious ten-minute plus sequence that also manages to feature tons of stunt-work and gory action to make for a spectacular highlight. Other big action scenes include the final battle in the house where the reanimated bodies all start coming back to life in the lab while the battle in the tunnel features some creepy zombie make-up and leads into the thrilling sword fight at the finale. Along with that fantastic zombie make-up and fun gore, these are enough to build this up against the few flaws here, which include the continuous video-game sequences in the middle of a random scene which is quite aggravating for the quantity of times its done and the selection of scenes it showcases. They're distracting, don't fit the tone of what's happening and seem to be done merely to placate fans of the game. The only other flaw here is the decision to utilize the running zombie tactics that's just completely unrelated to anything in the film that we're given as to the source of their resurrection. These here are the film's only real flaws that hold it down.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Nudity, and drug use.",

For me, though, such descriptions are unfair to Ed Wood, whose films were at the very least entertaining. HOUSE OF THE DEAD is nothing like; it's an awful film and even worse than the previous Boll film I watched, ALONE IN THE DARK.An erstwhile adaptation of the popular arcade game, this is a traditional zombie film which sees a group of unwary ravers falling foul of some zombies that emerge from the depths of the ocean to wreak havoc upon the living. So far, so B-movie, but the direction and technical values are of such an appalling quality that even the most generous of movie buffs will struggle to enjoy this. Desperate attempts to interest viewers, such as the gratuitous nudity, fail to work, leaving this a train wreck of a film.Incredibly, Boll gets everything wrong at every point. The decision to include actual clips of the video game is stupid in the extreme. His direction is rubbish, as is the acting, even from seasoned genre veterans like Jurgen Prochnow and Clint Howard. The effects are poor and although the film contains non-stop action, it's thoroughly dull because said action is so poorly staged. Dull, dull, dull and silly throughout, comic book in style but lacking the energy and excitement of a comic book adaptation. The worst zombie movie ever made?

As a long time game and genre fan I can appreciate the slight throwbacks to it's core audience. The film doesn't really represent any one of the games although I'm quite sure it acts as a prequel to them. The same way the infintely better Resident Evil did. it's about a supposed killer rave(That looks more like a ho down) on a island where the people are suddenly attacked buy a weirdos zombie experiments and turned into food for the fast and ever growing undead population.  The film really is nothing more than that. There are some cool but overused camera techniques. Mostly stolen from other films but used in creative ways and some decent splatter fx accompanied with hilariously intentional and unintentional dialogue and scenes.

If I wanted a video game I would have played the game not shelled out the four bucks for the rental of this mind waster.Frankly Hollywood isn't to be blamed for making crap like this, we're the ones dumb enough to see it despite the warning signs in the trailers.",

Until i met a great educational flick called 'House Of The Dead' by Dr. Uwe Boll, there had been not a single film that i decided stop watching in the middle of viewing. Yes i mean it. I never quit a movie in the middle of watching it no matter how it sucks or bores because i'm a type of guy who is over-patient and likes the phrase \"it ain't over til it's over\". Once i play a movie, then i finish it by all means, only unless inevitable things happen and force me to quit it in the middle. That was basic cinema-watching attitude of mine for 30 years.And then suddenly, one day about a year ago, i happened to meet this great educational flick and it broke my history just like a revolution. I played it, and Jesus can you believe, i quit and ran exactly at 40 minutes without any special situations or reasons.Yogi, i'm afraid you're wrong. Something must be over before it's over...That's not only thing that i learned from this great educational flick. I admit that i generally tend to ignore (or intentionally skip) others' reviews or comments on some films which i've not seen yet, and especially for majority of opinions i don't care for them at all. Yes it's just like \"I don't listen to anybody before viewing it myself and valuating is just mine\"..... But with this great educational flick, i learned that sometimes i need to be more open to others' WARNINGS at least.After all, this film had such huge educational effects on me and i can't help giving it 10/10 for it.",

One needs to believe what's happening in a movie to see the humor when a situation goes incredibly wrong. Without boundaries, the movie becomes absurd. HotD lacks any believability.Worse still, HotD brings nothing new to the genre, and repeats the same plot twists and character reactions that many horror movies inevitably start to exhibit. For example, all too often, horror movies fall into the trap where the main characters find love amongst the gore and destruction. I don't know about you, but when I'm being chased by zombies, I wanna make out with a hot chick. Believe it? No? Then, you probably won't believe it when the characters start sucking each other's faces in this movie.Beyond the obvious issues that plague this movie like so many other horror movies, Uwe Boll elected to add scenes from the video game of zombies being shot, randomly whenever a character shoots a zombie in the movie. Not only is there no clear rationale for this artistic choice, but it distracts one from an already unbelievable plot. Further, there are frequent and numerous examples of bad acting, and seemingly no attempts by the director to guide the actors' reactions to events... leaving the movie with no redeeming qualities.

Poor acting, predictable characters, heck, even the nudity is poor (no offense to the actress).Maybe Uwe Boll is actively trying to be like Ed Wood, believing that after he is dead a neo-Tim Burton will create a masterful biopic of his awful movies.

Taking a similar approach to the previous year's Resident Evil adaptation, the film was intended to be a prequel to the game series to allow for some leeway in approaching the adaptation, but none of that really matters because the movie is one of the worst and most incompetently made movies to EVER received a wide release.The story of the movie (and I use the words \"story\" and \"movie\" loosely) is so incompetently structured with overdone narration and haphazardly structured flashbacks that you'd swear this was a first time production from all involved. The characters are all beyond brainless as they spend $1,000 to charter a boat to go to this rave and when they arrive to find the place deserted and a mess with clear signs of something bad having happened their first instinct is to have sex and drink! The movie's plot is so anorexicly thin that it could hardly serve as the basis for a light gun game, let alone an entire movie.The technical aspects of the movie are equally woeful, throughout the movie scenes from the House of the Dead video game are randomly spliced into scenes with no rhyme or reason, and the sequences are poorly set up with cheap looking shots and bad framing. The movie also overuses arc shots to a ridiculous degree, as many action sequences will consist of shots wherein the camera circles around a character whilst standing perfectly still. The actors who play our motley crew of idiots range from passable to not even trying, one particular scene that is downright laughable is a sequence early on that involves one of the women being vomited on and her reaction looks like giggling more than disgust. There are two exceptions to the bad acting on display and they are J\u00fcrgen Prochnow and Clint Howard as Captain Kirk and his first mate Salish respectively. Despite the quality of the movie they're in, both of them aren't sleep walking and bring their A-Game to c-grade material.Despite House of the Dead doing nearly every tenet of basic film making and story telling wrong, I have to admit that I kind of love this movie. It's a bad movie, but it's also an entertaining movie that needs to be viewed. Much like \"so bad they're good\" staples like Troll 2, The Room, Miami Connection, and the myriad of other laughable schlock that lives in infamy, House of the Dead deserves its place among this revered group so it may be enjoyed sober, high, buzzed, or any other number of states so it's awkwardness and shoddiness can be gawked at. It's a piece of crap that I'll recommend to any bad movie fan.",

House of the Dead (which really takes place on an island full of \"dead zombies\") is not only not a good horror movie - it's not even a bad one. It was excruciatingly painful to watch. The only reaction that my friend and I had watching it together was looking at each other with our mouths hanging open. I think the only words spoken between us was \"what?!\" We had to look up when it was made (trying to make excuses for it). Our only conclusion was \"well if a 12-year old boy made it - it was a pretty good attempt.\" But when I couldn't resist looking up their trailer for the director/producer information and actual found out he was a grown man and had the guts to take credit for making this movie -including letting all us viewers know about his 360 degree camera (or whatever he called it) which, by the way, he over uses in the film. I was dumbfounded.If I had made this mess - I would have legally changed my name after it's release, and maybe even undergone plastic surgery so I would not be recognized.The (so-called) actors were terrible, the story was terrible the so-called special effects were a joke - I think the director was asleep during the taping. In one scene - seconds after killing hundreds of zombies a young couple (who just discovered they had \"feelings\" for one another) start making out - like nothing ever happened. Fast-forward a bit and the guy who was just making out sacrifices himself to save his 3 remaining friends and blows up the zombies (along with himself) with some kegs of gunpowder. The girlfriend and the others make it out alive - her reaction to this, when the smoke clears \"Where are we?\" Her nor his other buddies were even given one \"line\" to say about the poor slob that saved their lives. Anyway, she ends up dying anyway (boo hoo!)- and two remain to fight off the \"leader zombie\" who apparently can never die - even when his head gets chopped off. The last remaining female surviver gets stabbed with a sword - right THROUGH the middle of her chest - and guess what? - the special effects department must have ran out of fake blood! She's actually sitting there with a spot of blood where she was Peirce - but never bled out! Unbelievable.I can't even stand talking about this anymore.Please don't even be curious, don't even be tempted to watch this movie - I'm serious - You won't even get one laugh out of it - it is a total waste of time.

They hire a fishing boat captain to take them there. Once they arrive, they find the place completely trashed and everyone is missing (only one of them thinks that this is weird). When searching for the other ravers, our heroes instead find themselves face to face with a pack of vicious, blood-thirsty zombies. Will they survive the night? Frankly, you won't care because you'll be too busy thinking of increasingly brutal things to do to the director of this train wreck, Uwe Boll.What can be said that hasn't already been said about this movie? It is one of the worst movies of all-time and it's not difficult to see why. It's terrible not only because it has nothing in common with the video game it is based on, but because it is so incompetent on every level imaginable.The cinematography is amateurish and laughable. The movie seems to have been edited by a chimpanzee. Huge chunks of plot and scenes are left on the cutting floor. The action sequences are edited in ways that would make Michael Bay look like James Cameron. It's not entirely clear what the heck is going on, whether it is a sword-fight, a shootout, or a simple chase. Oh, and did I mention that Boll inserts clips from the game into the action? I'm NOT making this up! He actually does this! Why? I have no clue. Probably because he thought it looked cool, but it just makes the whole thing confusing, pointless, and stupid. Equally questionable is Bowl's abusive use of bullet-time. Every time someone shoots at a zombie, a camera does a 360 degree angle swoop around him/her. Again, I have no idea why except that Bowel thought it looked cool. But AGAIN, it just looks cheap and ridiculous, and it gave me a headache. And I just HAVE to say this, but whenever the characters go into bullet-time mode, they are holding a different weapon then they were in the previous shot!Okay, so the editing and action sucks, but it's not the biggest problem. The acting was absolutely atrocious, and the dialogue was even worse. The actors playing the 20-somethings look too old to still be in college. I cringed every time they (or anyone else for that matter) opened their mouths and said something. Here are some lines that should go down as classics:-\"I found this book. It looks pretty old. Maybe it will help us.\"-\"It looks like it's been there for a millennia.\"-\"You did this to become immortal. Why?\"-\"Look at that house. Should we go inside?\"-\"We tried to get to the boat, but it wasn't there.\"-\"They're obviously zombies, plain and simple. The sooner we accept that, the sooner we can move on with our lives.\"Those are but a few lines of dialogue these we have to sit through. What's more, the actors can't act if their lives depended on it. They show zero emotion and give their characters no personality whatsoever. They often talk as if they are reading from note cards. And whenever one of them dies, they show curiously little sadness. Even the major stars, Jurgen Prochnow and Clint Howard (who plays Prochnow's first mate) appear embarrassed to be on screen. We don't really know who these people are, so we could care less about what happens to them. Oh, and can someone PLEASE tell me how a group of college students who have never even touched a gun before magically become an expert shot AND a Kung fu master all in less than a minute? Jesus! Talk about plot holes (out of millions, trust me)! There is also a weird attempt to explain how the zombies were created. What it is I will not say, except that it doesn't make any sense and actually raises more questions than it answers.The movie is extremely cheap-looking, too. The zombies look like extras with some gray powder thrown in their face. Sometimes they don't have any make-up on at all! Speaking of which, these \"zombies\" act most un-zombie-like. They can swim, leap incredible heights (thanks to some obviously placed trampolines), run, and even use weapons. WTF?!?!?! Oh, and zombies can't be killed, OK? In this movie, if you slash at them, shoot them anywhere on their bodies (hip, shoulder, chest, head, etc.), they die. NO! AND ZOMBIES DON'T BLEED, OK?! Man, this movie gives me a headache just trying to figure it out. Anyway, the sets look terrible as well. In particular, the titular house and the graveyard surrounding it both look like they were stolen from the Haunted Mansion ride in Disneyland. And apparently the house is magic, because it looks tiny on the outside, but is absolutely enormous inside. I could go on and on how horrific this monstrosity is. It's worse than getting three root canals, in one day! It's worse than anything Paul W.S. Anderson can throw at us (now that's scary!). It makes you realize that suicide may not be such a bad idea after. Well actually, I don't recommend that, but you know what I mean. I could go on, but that would result in a twenty-page essay. I will conclude this review by saying that Uwe Boll is without a dount the worst filmmaker alive. This movie alone cements his status as the modern-day equivalent of Ed Wood. Hands down one of the ten worst movies I've ever seen. Stay away if you know what's good for you.Rating: 1/10 Grade: F If I could go lower, I would.P.S. Sorry this was a long review. I just had to get the anger I felt after watching this steaming pile of cow-crap off my chest.",

            "content": "I feel sorry for Uwe Boll. Everyone basically hates him for releasing such garbage and ruining the videogames he takes off with (though is \"ruining\" the right term? This is, after all, House of the Dead...). After watching the commentary on Alone in the Dark to hear what he had to say for himself, I learned that Uwe Boll does not create such terrible, terrible film out of a lack of caring or complete negligence, he really does believe in every mis-cut one-dimensional broken piece of action shot quipped with bad dialog he is responsible for.This movie doesn't even need to have the commentary to feel this from him. Immersed in all of it's terrible glory, one can still feel the love Uwe Boll has from the camera as he misdirects scene after horrible, horrible scene.A rave is being held on the Isle del Muerte (and in this case Uwe Boll insults our intelligence again by actually having a character translate this to us: \"That means The Island of the Dead!\" He's the same character who states \"Sprechen Sie English?\" What a multilingual type!) Some characters pay over a thousand dollars to get to this party (why?!?!?!), but when they get there, no one's around. Irregardless, they go about dancing, drinking beer, sexing it up... but despite their total lack of ability to do anything anybody normal would do, like wonder where everybody went or whatever, they get pulled into the action anyways. Or whatever.Rain falls on a boat but never on the island. Day and night seem to come whenever it feels like it. Zombies are scary by putting their hands on trees and flying. The action is either akin to that movie your younger brother shot with his friends in the woods behind the house, or it's faux-Matrixy bullet-time. There are boobs for no good reason whatsoever, and even more pathetically, men who are around those boobs who don't go anywhere with it because they're either insane (fisherman guy), idiotic (\"I have to pee!\") or just wimps, (\"No way, the water's too cold!\"). And mixed with it all is a lot of screenshots from the game, an idea that might have worked out if Boll didn't use it to transition between scenes randomly or whatever.Good things this movie has, since it's appeal, action, continuity, editing, and dialog are terrible, are its allusions to other films... Romero gets a significant nod (what's a zombie movie without questioning whether Romero will come out with another zombie movie?), Scooby Doo, The Elephant Man, Lord of the Rings, I Know What You Did Last Summer, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, they all get their respective shout-outs.It's better than Alone in the Dark. It had one scene that was at least fun to watch, the action one outside of house. Too bad it takes too long, being that the terrible song that plays entirely through during it ends... and a new one begins. But it was fun to watch. The rest of it is rather exhausting, trying to keep up with it, trying not to vomit from the absurd dialog, trying not yell at the film for wasting your time... Meh.I could go on forever, but you have more reviews to read about it. You know you read these reviews to hear the many various ways people hate this movie! It's more entertaining than the movie itself.--PolarisDiB",

It's so bad, you'll feel ashamed and dirty all over after the entire affair (assuming you don't turn this off 10 minutes into it).I had VERY low expectations for this movie. A trailer and teaser came on my Xbox version of House of the Dead 3. It looked pretty bad already, and a teaser is supposed to show all the good bits and make you want to go to theatres. This trailer definitely didn't, so you know you're in trouble as a film maker. It looked like a crappy costume party in the woods, or a high school film student's work. I finally saw it a few days ago to see why everyone hated it so much. Hard as it is to believe, this movie goes way below my worst expectations and even the harshest reviews aren't harsh enough. It's more horrible than I could have ever imagined. Every possible facet of this movie so completely bad! It defies belief that a man can be so stupid.Sometimes critics have subjective reasons for disliking a film. There is no room for subjectivity here. This movie is an unequivocal and irrefutable heap of steaming turd. Uwe Boll, how can you sleep at night?! Shame on you and everyone associated with this abomination of celluloid garbage. Jurgen Prochnow of Das Boot fame, how low you've sunk!! Canadian punk singer Bif Naked just lost all points for her cameo.There is nothing redeeming about this movie, unless you count the fact that we see 2 examples of boobage in the first 10 minutes. Never mind the fact that Boll took the name of the game literally and actually made a house of the dead in the wood... Everything about this movie is idiotic. Characters with weapons at the ready stand doing nothing, looking like morons as their friends get chomped by zombies. Boll does the Matrix spin with EVERY character as they fire off their weapon. Lame. The makeup is horrible. Acting is horrible.. The game had plenty of source material and bad guys to choose from. It could've been a great action, sci-fi/horror film in the vein of Resident Evil (which was mediocre as a film, but Oscar gold compared to this monstrosity).If you like torture, watch this movie. I suggest Drain-o if you really want to kill yourself. It's much quicker.",

Boobs, 3. Beasts and this movie has all three in spades. The action scenes are hyper stylized yet original and interesting. The zombie effects are reminiscent of Lucio Fulci's \"Zombie\", plus they are practical effects, a super bonus considering many films, even those made in 2002 were relying far too heavily on cheap CGI effects. I will offer that some of the acting is pretty ridiculous at best but some performances including Clint Howard's are truly genre classic. Avoiding all story spoilers, as I think this film should be experienced in the purest way possible, I would like to point out overall the story moves at a brisk pace and never tests the audience in their patience. This film offers a lot for horror fans and whatever your previous opinion of this film is or if you haven't seen it yet I implore you to watch it again/first time with an open mind and a youthful enthusiasm for the strange and fantastic.",

Python\" back to back on my VCR and had a decent time). But \"House of the Dead\" made me hit my gag limit early on. How early? Try five minutes into the film.So every day or so, I'd go back and try to watch some more of it from my Tivo, and every time I'd quit in disgust within 3-5 minutes. I kept expecting it to get better somehow, or at least watchable, but it started out as pure crap and never wavered in its unwinking commitment to a level of suck rarely seen in professionally made movies. Eventually I managed to finish it (talk about misguided consumer masochism). And I just have to say...Uwe Boll is a phenomenally bad director. Just awful. It's obvious that he didn't really give the cast any real direction at all. He just left them out there on their own without a clue, and the results are like watching a first time 'reader's theater' walk-through of the working script. Not one single line of dialog worked. Not one scene was watchable. Not one story element made sense. Not once did the camera work and cinematography do anything but clumsily (and unsuccessfully) ape the ideas and techniques of other, far better movies. Not once did the plot engage my interest. Not once did I feel fear, shock, suspense, anxiety or interest in any of the characters. Timing, rhythm, story arc, character development, believable character reactions, consistent story structure or even decent SFX...\"House Of The Dead\" cares not for such things.And just to throw a final spadeful of dirt onto the grave, some genius decided to edit actual game footage from the original \"House Of the Dead\" game in the middle of some the action footage, a disastrous aesthetic choice that jams the incompetence of the proceedings into the audiences' faces like a hot-tar dermabrasion.The only reason this movie gets more than a \"1\" is because Jurgen Prochnow is in it and \"Das Boot\" was so great that I can't bear to give a \"1\" (or a \"0\") to something he was involved with.Not only can I not understand why Boll is allowed to go on making movies...I can't understand why audiences who paid money to see this abomination didn't riot and burn down the theaters. The producers must have arranged to sneak roofies into the oil on the buttered popcorn.",

            "content": "This film is a prequel to all of the The House of the Dead video games. Set on an island off the coast of Florida, a techno rave party attracts a diverse group of college coeds and a Coast Guard officer. Soon, they discover that their X-laced escapades are to be interrupted by zombies and monsters that attack them on the ground, from the air, and in the sea, ruled by an evil entity in the House of the Dead...House of the Dead is a popular video game in the arcade, not so much on the home console. Many video game titles aren't very good, Mario Bros, Resident Evil and Tomb Raider failed to please the fans of those games. House of the Dead manages to do something that those films were not able to do. Displease every single person who has ever heard of it.Uwe Boll is known as the video game filmmaker, after tackling this project and the equally \"brilliant\" Alone in the Dark, Boll's future projects include Bloodrayne, FarCry and Postal. All of which are video games. Who will get the unfortunate pleasure of being presented to us through the vision of Uwe Boll. It amazes me that this man still finds work today. Why people think he can bring video games to the screen is beyond me because he doesn't bring them to life, he kills them before they even get a chance.Now onto the film that is known as House of the Dead, well where do I start? There are no redeeming factors of this film. Not the cameo appearance of Clint Howard can save this, not even nudity from random young beautiful women. Uwe Boll somehow manages to take nudity/violence/horror/action/special effects and actually hurt a movie. These things are suppose to make them entertaining.The film for god know's why has random images from the actual video game in the film. Every time before a death I believe we see someone playing the game. I do not understand the reason behind this. Is Boll intentionally trying to tick off North America....maybe even the word? None of the characters are likable. The Chinese woman who wears American themed spandex jumps into the \"undead\" infested water to save the life of a man she met literally 5 seconds ago. She screams his name as if they were best friends.You can't forget the fact that every single one of these party people are able to pick up and fire a weapon, with 100% accuracy by the way. Can't forget the cool looking stances while shooting them. Well, if you call jumping up in the air with a shotgun a cool looking thing to do. Boll probably thought to himself, how can I make my film cooler...well, let's throw in that thing the matrix did, and now every other action movie is doing. Bullet Time. Horrendous.The film ultimately makes absolutely no sense what-so-ever to the viewer, or even those people involved. Everything bad that you've heard about this film is true, but even worse. It goes down in history as one of those movie that you want to smash to bits with whatever weapon you can find but then think to yourself that it doesn't even deserve that. You end up hating yourself for even watching it, or even thinking about watching it.House of the Dead is a horror movie that has no horror and too much action, It turns from horror to horror-ble. The make-up effects, well...look as if a 12 year old kid painted. Something that they would wear out or Halloween. It's a film like this that make you wonder why it got a theatrical release, or why it would even be considered for a direct to video release. It makes you wonder if you can come up with something better yourself, then you go to the bathroom and actually come up with something better...unfortunately you have to flush that down.",

So much is wrong with this movie, I don't even know where to begin.These kids all go to an island for a rave, get there and the place has been ransacked and there are no people anywhere. Is there one shred of concern for the missing partygoers by the latecomers? Not a bit. As a matter of fact, when zombies start killing people off, there's even less concern. The performances of the young actors are flat and uninspiring, you don't have any sympathy for their plight. The main 'ghoul' in the film doesn't even show up until the very end and what could have been an interesting plot is a ludicrous script with flashes of video game imagery and lots of firepower.The entire time the outnumbered partiers are racing about trying to escape this Godforesaken flick, not one tear is shed or one genuine scream released. If zombies were chasing you, I think you'd care just a wee bit more about the reality of your situation. One dramatic scene comes when the policewoman has her legs chewed off by zombies while the male lead is dragging her through a window. He offers a half-assed guilty speech on the uselessness of his lifesaving effort. Maybe his performance falls on its face because the rest of the material is so sucky, but really the speech comes too late for anyone to care.Do not spend any money to see this film. Do not wait for it on cable because you'll never get those 90 minutes of your life back. If you want to see an effective zombie flick, you're better off with 28 Days Later or one of the classics such as 'Dawn of the Dead'.

            "content": "I have heard a lot about infamous movies of Doctor Uwe Boll, but before now I hadn't seen any of them. But now I've corrected that gap in form of 'House Of The Dead', which was Boll's first film to get the wrath of video game fans upon itself.For the name of fairness I gave this film a whole 2 out of 10, as I honestly have seen movies below this one and because I am not a fan, nor I have ever played, or will play, the games this is based on, I genuinely believe I can give this film a just judgement.First the plot is terrible. Sure, this is a zombie flick and for good fun zombie flicks don't need to be that bright. But for crying out loud the script is beyond redemption in any scale. The whole idiocy of the ordeal shines out of the faces of the more seasoned actors like J\u00fcrgen Prochnow (Kirk) who obviously treats his role as it should be treated: a fast money job. Also this movie contains some of the baddest acting outside of porn industry, which brought in my mind the couple of \"sex\" scenes, which had surely taken the actor voices straight out of a porn film.As Boll is stated of being the worst filmmaker since Ed Wood, I feel obligated of saying something about the direction of the film. As anyone knows, even the most brainless horror films depend on one thing: suspension. If suspensions is there even more small scale films can spare some frights. But there is no suspensions in 'House Of The Dead' Everything goes among a straight line to the predictable end. Running zombies are so shoddily filmed, that the \"quick scares\" they should provide miss their target 10 times out of 10. This is most noticeable throughout the whole film, but especially on the graveyard fight scene, which is a) far too long, b) uses far too much bullet time in most idiotic places and c) is mostly badly choreographed.And then there is a thing I couldn't believe: the use of actual game footage. There was some in the opening credits, which I can understand, but then I noticed, that some reason not known to anyone expect Boll himself he has used the game footage in action scenes. And that is tacky if anything. This caused me to think: what did Boll wanted to achieve with that? Using the game footage he made the fight scenes campy, but then again he genuinely tries to make serious horror despite of the horrible dialogue and bad acting. That game footage is only clear element meant to be campy in the film, everything else is too serious.Then there is the music of the film. It the beginning there is this basic movie music with symphony orchestra, but then it turns into a full scale rave techno in the battle scenes and again turns back into typical movie soundtrack. It was like watching two different movies at the same time: badly written drama movie, which turns into badly directed action film.Some additional laughs I got from scenes clearly taken from other movies, like several underwater shot ala 'The Jaws' and there even was one, or actually some other scene might be considered to be originated from there, scene directly taken from 'The Fellowship of The Rings'.I could be more fair to this film if this would be someone debut direction, but alas this isn't the case. Boll has made several films before 'House Of The Dead' and as the quality of this film is what it is, I seriously doubt he could be any better backwards or forwards.Rating as a horror flick: 1 out of 10Rating as a camp comedy: 5 out of 10",

(sighs) When I heard about this movie in 2003, I didn't really want to watch it at first but when I was on Youtube, it was on there, but when I watched it, I was shocked on how bad it was. This movie wasn't just bad, it's friggin' horrible! You wanna know why? Well then I'll tell you.A group of 20 somethings are going out to an island to attend the so-called \"Rave of the Century.\" They are so desperate that they pay the Captain from Das Boot $1000. Jesus Christ, is that Rave actually worth going to when it barely resembles a Rave at all? The captain warns them about the Island they are going to is called the Island of the Dead. (Wait a second I thought this was HOUSE of the Dead.) He warns them about the dangers and blah blah blah blah. The first fault in this movie is that why the hell would a Rave of the Century (Bullcrap) would be held on some island? And who would wanna pay a sh*t load of money to go there? THAT'S STUPID! After they arrive at the Rave (Which holds about two tents, a small stage and a port-a-john, damn I would have want my money back.) They discovered that someone has crashed the party. Blood's everywhere and no one is around, what do you think you would have done? Run for your live of course but these retards also blind people apparently go looking for their friends.They come across an old house that is many times bigger than it looks outside. Another half hour of stupidity passes with deaths of the luckier people who get killed first. So what do these dumb asses do? Absolutely nothing, it's like their saying, \"Hey with all these zombies going around killing our friends, let's just not do anything and get killed off!\" Then we get more and more bad acting, stupid dialogue of jibber jabber, and billions of clips of the once-popular House of the Dead game. Why they put this in the movie, I don't know, they were probably taking crack at the time.The only good thing about this movie, is Jurgen Prochnow who tried to save the movie with his character, but he doesn't though he tried so hard to. Jesus, this movie makes Double Dragon an Oscar-worthy movie, and that's a bad sign there! So our heroes come back to the house where they face the so-called zombies. At first they face about 10 of them, and then suddenly a crapload more come in from nowhere. You wanna know what else is strange? When the people get the guns, they suddenly turn into Commandos and then become super accurate! I mean, it doesn't make any sense! So they blast the leathery undead feigns away, zombies are killed left and right, it's just crazy and boring, seriously, I nearly fell asleep after watching this scene. But in the heat of the battle, one of the characters are being eaten and the other character bothers not to help her but decides to have a long ass flashback that leads to this point! WHAT?! That is stupid! Who has a flashback while their friend is being killed? This is the part the ticks me off to NO END! Who would want to put this in a movie?! Goddamn it, I should have sent this piece of garbage to the Marx Brothers! After fighting their way through the hordes of evil, they learn that a preacher created these monsters to become immortal. The hero and villain say possible one of the stupidest sentences ever spoken in a film. Dumb Hero who can't act: You created these monsters to become immortal. Why? Evil villain who also can't act: To live forever! Reviewer who is MAD: THIS MOVIE IS Stupid!So two people are left with the destruction of the zombie menace, they finally live happily ever- WAIT! The preacher has survived and engages the two survivors in a sword battle, they defeat the preacher but the second survivor dies, leaving only one left. The Special Forces arrive and save the survivor named Rudy Curien. Wait a minute, Curien? Oh okay, so the name makes a cameo but do you ever see the doctor anywhere? HELL NO! G and Rogan were barely in it; the Magician isn't in it either, so what the hell is the point of adding Curien there when the movie barely resembles House of the Dead? THE MOVIE BLOWS! It makes you want to slit you wrist and take a cyanide pill! It makes Super Mario Bros. Movie look like a masterpiece. House of the Dead could've been a good movie, but they screwed it up! You know who is to be blamed for this? UWE BOLL, the director who keeps smucking up our favorite games by turning them into crap! I mean, who the hell hires a director that messes up video game movies? Are these game producers taking cocaine while drinking a bottle of whiskey? If Uwe Boll ever asked me for the rights to turn my video game into his movie, I probably punch him in the face and spit on him. Don't EVER watch one of his movies, don't even watch Far Cry because I saw the trailer and it sucks! So that concludes my review for House of the Dead, I give it a 1 out of 10.",

If it was actually worth it is definitely questionable, but, I did manage to get some good laughs and a new Top Worst Film of All Time.So, let's get this out of the way. Uwe Boll's House of the Dead lives up to the hype. It really is the worst (zombie) movie ever made. I cannot stress that enough really...it IS pure crap. Honestly, the only thing this movie is good for is unintentional laughs or a good nap. I found myself dozing off in a few of the action scenes as they were just plain boring. (And for some reason I decided to rewind some of them to see if I missed out on story\u0085whoops! Bad mistake there)! The acting is atrocious, the score is beyond annoying (seriously, techno beats throughout the whole movie??), the story is almost non-existent, the characters are unbelievable and unlikeable (we get nil development and all stupidity) and the special effects are appalling.For those who have no idea what House of the Dead is about, it is only fair to fill you in. Based off the popular rail-shooting arcade games, this follows a group of teens who are trying to get to a rave on an island. They miss their scheduled boat by 15 minutes, so they pay a smuggler to take them there. Upon arrival, they discover everyone is gone and the place is trashed. Do they leave? Nope, they stay for the free beer and to wander around in groups. They soon discover the island is infested with zombies, so they take refuge in a house and try survive the night.I do not know what could have been going through Boll's brain (if it exists) when he was making this. Shouldn't a smart, normal human realise they are making a bad movie when your teenage ravers can shoot shotguns, desert eagles and sub-machine guns with 100% precision and accuracy? Oh, and they can also perform high level martial arts! Shouldn't an intelligent man know its a bad movie when your action scenes directly rip-off \"The Matrix\" with poor CGI and dodgy slo-mo? Finally, how the holy $#*& can someone think inserting game footage into the movie makes it better? I am not joking when I say this, Boll actually includes numerous clips from the game during the action scenes and even includes a Game Over screenshot when one of the ravers dies! House of the Dead is consistently good at being absolute trite. With zombies that look identical (and are able to swim, sword-fight and get angered by breaking tanks full of red water), with bullets igniting barrels of gunpowder and with the power to get stabbed and die, but get up and crush a zombie's head only to die again, Uwe Boll has successfully created the most idiotic film in history. The movie is funny, though, and many could find joy at laughing at the many plot holes and clich\u00e9s abundant throughout. Moreover, the random nudity may please some\u0085 Congratulations, Mr. Boll, you have managed to rape what could have been at least a mediocre movie! 0/5",

I ordered this from Net-flix cause it had zombies. I like zombies. Saw Night of the Living Dead when I was 10 at a drive-in. Yes, the year it was released. So I'm pretty up on zombies. Having seen everything the cinema has to offer, good and bad.But I had no idea just how bad, bad could be.I have played the game of the same name, and thought okay, gore and scares for a Friday night -- even though I was aware that schlocky Uwe Boll directed it I thought -- okay cheesy B-grade fun. And then I saw his name. The man responsible for the stupidest film, I think I have ever seen. The Dead Hate the Living. And he directed and wrote that mess.(you can see my review of that film on IMDb)Okay. So I gave him the benefit of the doubt. I thought maybe he'd improved. Maybe he'd grown an imagination or magically learned to write dialog that sounded real. I'd give him a second chance. I watched the film.No humor. No arc to the story line. Action that went on for far too long. Like a heavy-metal video that increases in volume and speed, going no where fast. Not a character of interest. No twist. No surprises. No horror. No suspense. No house (to speak of)I'm thinking as I watch, and here's what I am thinking. Better story. Bring the kids in for a concert. They land on the wrong side of the island. One character is playing a hand-held version of the \"House of the Dead\". The two other important characters are the Stud boy, whose girlfriend is already at said concert. And of course the girl herself waiting for said Stud on the other side of the island.To get to the concert they have to get through the dense forest. In the forest there be zombies. (Zombies won't go to close to the concert which is in progress because of the lights) The character with said game is the dude with the info. He ascends to a new, as of yet unknown level of the game, which takes place on an island. Now all the tools they need to survive are there. He plays the game during fierce attacks. The other friends who came with, whoever, are zombie snacks, of course.Plot: The key to surviving the night is in that strange house, in the basement. And only the nerd with the hand-held game can get it. Subplot: Captain and First mate (a hot babe) are trying to sail around island while being attacked. Two expendable mates are zombie chow.Back at the concert, said girlfriend, begins seeing things on the fringes of the concert. She tries to warn others. Suddenly the lights go out! Feeding frenzy climax. Stud rescues girlfriend with help from nerd with hand-held game. All others die horribly.Girl (Hot Babe) with boat rescues threesome. Captain and crew dead.Twist ending optional. (relating to that unknown level in the game, of course or that the Hot Babe has become a member of the undead)Is it that hard to make a good cheesy B-grade horror flick. I don't think so. Then again I'm a professional writer with 27 years experience. Granted, not in screen writing but a story is a story, regardless.There ya go Dave -- feel free to use it -- you need any help you can get.",

Too bad they missed the party, everyone on the island has joined the legion of the undead. The teens, along with a gun-slinging seaman, must fight for survival against the zombies. What follows is a night of loud music, MTV-style photography, and a helluvalot of exploding zombie heads. Seriously folks, this has got to be one of the most\u0085upsetting, film experience I've ever sat through. Where do the problems start? Probably with director Uwe Boll, whose film-making skills are non-existent. Someone needs to slap this guy across the face for this mess. I don't get it, did he really think bullet-time shots and slow-motion shoot-out scenes impress us? There's no suspense, the \"dramatic\" scenes are real eye-rollers (Thankfully though you always know their coming when the sappy piano music starts up), and the pacing\u0097the graveyard scene went on for what seemed like half a freakin' hour!The bad writing is no helping matter. The characters are 1-D and frankly quite stupid, the only likable person here being Jurgen Prochnow as captain Kirk (Get it!?!? Get it!?!? Captain humor?!?! Funny!!!) who spent virtually the entire movie shooting zombies left and right (Conveniently, his character smuggled and endless arsenal of illegal fire power onto the island). Acting? Like everything else here, pretty bad, Mr. Prochnow aside. The script may be a factor here to, but bad acting is still bad acting. Oh, and the woman playing the coast guard (name escapes me right now) was especially awful. So what you fan boy's been waiting for\u0097the gore. Yep, it's here, most of it involving zombies and not humans (most of the death scenes are disappointingly off-screen). We get exploding heads, limbs flying, bloody gun-shot wounds, and more. There were also lots of zombies (but I guess that's a given since this is billed as a zombie movie). Problem is, none of these effects are particularly good. In fact, some of them were hilarious. The zombies are mostly brought to life with stiff-looking prosthetics, with the occasional unconvincing rod puppet thrown in for measures. Hey, I'd prefer the good IL' make-up effects over crappy CG any day, but the effects are still disappointingly weak. The flaws are hilarious and too numerous to into with great detail. My favorite is when (spoiler alert!) the house explodes and we get a slow-motion shot of the front door exploding off its hinges. Literally two scenes later\u0097yep, you guessed it\u0097the door is back on, and in perfect shape. Not even singed by flames. Good continuity on that one!This is a bad, bad movie, so bad in fact that between the direct-to-video production values and the rancid script, its hard to tell what's worse. See it only, and I mean only, if your goal in life is to see every bad movie out there.A well deserved 1/10.",

            "content": "\"House of the Dead\" is definitely one of the worst films of all time and surprise, surprise it comes from one of the worst directors of all time; the dreaded Uwe Boll. Uwe Boll spends most of his time adapting video-games into movies, and like everyone else he fails miserably (perhaps more miserable then the likes of Paul WS Anderson). \"House of the Dead\" is no different; in fact you will enjoy it more as a coaster for a beer glass rather than in the DVD player. House of dead fails on literally every level imaginable; the plot, acting, character development visual effects, and hell; even the gore are atrocious.\"House of the Dead\" has perhaps one of the sorriest excuses for a plot in cinematic history. A group of teenagers are heading to an abandoned island in the middle of a lake for a rave party. Now this brings about the first question- why on earth would a rave party be in the middle of a lake? That's just insane! OK back to the plot, the teenagers arrive late and miss the ferry to the island. So they pay a local sailor to transport them there. This local sailor's name is Captain Kirk (ha\u0085.ha\u0085) and has an unusual deckhand Salish. After arriving on the island they find everyone to be gone and peculiar as it is not all of them seem bothered by this. Hmm\u0085 it's perfectly normal for a rave party to have no one attending isn't it (another one of these moments where the stupidity of the writing unearths itself). Soon after they are thrown into a melting pot of; explosions, violence and bullets and zombies instead of; horror, gore and charter development which is essentially for a good zombie movie.Now onto the writing. \"House of the Dead\" was obviously written by an untalented 12 year old with no sense of what a narrative arc is, or just simply no sense at all. The film is just so poorly constructed each scene seems to be just stuck on to the other. The characters just go from place to place blowing stuff up with no car in their minds. There is no tension built and no real horror built. This results in a bland and unappealing horror movie. Even the characters are poorly developed, all they to is run, shoot and exclaim. Rarely is time spent to develop their relationships and to reveal aspects about their personality. Consequently viewers will dismiss the characters of being any importance and not care if they die. Which brings me onto my next point; most modern horror films try to disguise poor story telling with gore. House of the dead doesn't even do that, and as a zombie film that is quite a striking flaw. All good zombie films have had at least some memorable gore; \"Dawn of the Dead\" and \"Night of the Living Dead\" to name a few. The best house of dead offers is some really bad exploding heads, and little zombie eating flesh scenes. The best house of the dead offers is a few dismemberment's that are about as appealing as watching a snail move across your backyard porch.The acting is another such aspect of the film that is as poor as the writing. Not one of these characters is able to pull of a good act. The actors seem awkward in their roles and present their lines as if they were told what to say and how to say it. You know say \"Lets get out of here\" in a scared voice. This clearly resembles Uwe Boll's sub terrible direction. Uwe Boll seems unable to even make his actors act, let alone present the scares that all horror movies should have. It seems as if he was more concerned with racking up a body count, then making a good film.Even the little flaws of the film stick into you like shards of glass. Most amateur filmmakers can even avoid these obvious flaws- I don't for the life of me know how Uwe could have missed these. Towards the middle of the movie the teenagers and assorted others approach a house (which looks more like a shack) and see the area littered with zombies. But we see something else- the ground was covered with red flaws to illuminate the scene. Yep I don't know how anyone could have missed that while filming. But then again no ordinary people made this atrocity.Overall \"House of the Dead\" is a terrible film, a terrible video game adaption and a terrible zombie film. With no redeeming characteristics at all, this will make all audiences laugh at the utter stupidity of the film instead of enjoying it. Overall \"House of the Dead\" receives a 0.4/10 with the only aspect of the film responsible for the .4 being, the fact that some of the zombie makeup effects were quite interesting.",

I love when the heros open up on the badguys and clean house. heck I even like to watch a badguy clean house sometimes. But this gunfight was weird I guess that the best way to describe it is \"Apathetic\" I've seen people shoot with more feeling and emotion while PLAYING THE VIDEOGAME. In this movie it looked and felt like the \"Actors\" were simply walking through shooting everything that moved without emotion.Why? Where's the trash talking? where's the snarls of rage amongst the gunfire? These are supposed to be kids that got caught at a rave gone bad... but even real soldiers acting professionally and ruthlessly show their humanity.If you want a GOOD horror movie about a secluded house full of monsters, I recomend Sam Rami's Evil Dead series.

            "content": "If there were a movie that deserved a 0 out of 10, this would be it. 'House of the Dead' redefines the term \"bad movie\". Other bad movies, such as 'When A Stranger Calls' or 'Premonition', will actually look much better when compared to 'House of the Dead'. The basic \"plot\" of House of the Dead is a group of twenty-somethings travel to a remote island to attend the \"rave of the century\". When they get there, they only find some tents, a bar, a stage, and some bloody t-shirts. They decide to stay anyway, and they are soon attacked by zombies.There is absolutely nothing redeeming about this movie. It is not entertaining. Instead, it is painful to watch because of how terrible it is. The acting is unbelievably bad. In a DVD interview, one of the actors claimed that Uwe Boll, the director, is not afraid to tell someone when they are doing a good job or a bad job in a scene. This is a blatant lie. The script appears to have been written by an 11-year-old, who decided to include a scene of someone throwing up on a girl's chest and to include the hilarious line, \"it smells like someone farted out here.\" The characters have no personality or depth and they do some of the most moronic things ever seen in a horror movie. Somewhere along the way, the characters also magically transform into a SWAT team to take down the zombies. It's like they don't even have to aim their guns and they automatically shoot the zombies in the head.The scariest thing by far about this movie is the directing. There is something wrong with Uwe Boll. Boll's camera work is astonishingly disjointed. His pans to zombies running through the forest are more silly than menacing. Worse yet, Boll actually thought it would be a good idea to include small bits of footage from the House of the Dead video game into the movie. Quite often, and at the most random times, you will suddenly see an animated zombie getting shot. It makes no sense. No one in their right mind would think that was a good idea. It's like Boll wants to remind us repeatedly that this movie is supposed to be based on the video game. Uwe Boll also decided it would be cool to include slow motion 360 degree rotating shots during the action scenes, a la 'The Matrix'. Unfortunately, he does it way too often and each shot is nauseating. The soundtrack to this movie also boggles the mind. Most action scenes are accompanied by loud rap track. This also adds to the ensuing headaches caused by the atrocious 'House of the Dead'.'House of the Dead' isn't bad because it's based on a video game. In fact, it has very little to do with the video game. It also does not fit into the category of 'so bad that it's good'. It does however fit into the category of 'so bad that it's painful'. This movie just plain sucks. Uwe Boll should never be let anywhere near another movie set. Even his presence will curse a production. To all the directors out there: whenever one of your movies gets a bad review, all you have to do is remember that you didn't make 'House of the Dead' and you will feel much better. I will never get those 90 minutes of my life back. To sum it up, words really cannot describe just how bad this movie is. Everyone involved in the production of this film, especially Uwe Boll, should be ashamed of themselves. Although what I have said may make 'House of the Dead' sound funny, it really isn't. Nothing about it is funny. Avoid this at all costs.",

Troll 2 is an abysmal horror film, but at least in some parts it's so bad it's somewhat entertaining to an extent. HOTD was just tediously.awful; a bit of a demeaning title, badly careless directing, bad no-name actors who can't act whose performances were so wooden that ventriloquist dolls would've been more convincing, action sequences that tediously dragged on and on like a bloody English lesson, and a stupid plot of what there was of it.Before I go further into the details (i.e. faults) of the film, this was directed by Uwe Boll, the man responsible for last year's disaster-piece Alone In The Dark (I haven't seen it, but with an IMDb rating of 2.2 and having watched HOTD I'm very sure I don't need to in order to know it's rubbish). He also has some other piles of pure film manure on his CV. It's clear that the only thing about the audience he cares about is their money (or ripping it from them, rather). It just looked as though he got all of the actors/actresses and said \"Read the script, and act it out, using the cue cards all the way through, and that's it\". It's seems that he wouldn't care about directing his actors/actresses out of a wet paper bag properly in any film he directs.As I mentioned above the title is a bit demeaning, this because it's House Of The Dead yet zombies appear all over the bleeding island. The mundane plot is that a group of 20-somethings want to go an island to go to a rave (which just has few tents, a stage, a port-a-john and non-rave music), but they miss the boat so they blow $1,000 to two craggy boatmen to get them to take them there. When they get there, they find that nobody's there and the \"rave\" area has blooded T-Shirts. They shelter themselves in a house, (which is a shed on the outside but the diameter of a barn on the inside), where the king zombie was created. They do eventually find some of the rave attack survivors, and they spend the rest of the film tediously killing all of the zombies until the end before killing the king zombie. The action sequences also had flashes of the game \u0096why?! Probably because not many people have heard of the game. But there's another point: why make a film based on a game that not many people have even heard off? If you're going do it, Mr. Boll, then at least do it properly. Also on the fact that this film was an adaptation from a computer game, it joins the rather long string of films of this kind to suck.I.went through the tedious torment of watching this so you don't have to.

I'm talking about how all the college kids turned into Rambo just like that with the Asian chick becoming Bruce Lee complete with jeet kun do moves and such.One second they're running from zombies, next they know exactly how to reload shotguns, hit their targets a mile away and can karate kick someone with such velocity you'd think Chuck Norris was fighting along with them.I mean its all fine and dandy to watch but you have to sit back and go \"that's totally not real.\" It also threw in action shots from the video game as an attempt to be cool, but the games story lines had nothing to do with the movie at hand so there was no point.It was a watchable movie, don't get me wrong but I expected better.

            "content": "I rented this movie free with Constantine which came bundled in with my Blockbuster Rewards program at my local Blockbuster, not knowing what else to rent besides this and like, persay... Interview With the Vampire, which was sitting just a row or two away from it under the Horror section of the store, which sparks this whole controversy... is that thing a horror movie or another failed attempt at trying to recreate a video game, on screen? I was so flabbergasted and let down by the destruction of a great game franchise that I'll never forgive myself for renting this instead of Interview With the Vampire.First, the acting. There's really not much to comment on nor salvage here seeing as there's just not enough source material to justify that the cast and acting job was done well enough to please the audience. You have legion upon legion of zombies, and a bunch of orally-challenged teenagers who try to act like they are in a Shakespeare drama, and very badly at that. With horrible and corny dialog that was just as badly acted out and sought after as the lines themselves, this movie gives you lines like \"it's okay, I'm on the pill\" and \"this is the Island de la Morte, which is Spanish for death in case you don't speak Mexican,\" and those are just to name a couple of the so-called \"lines\" in this film. But the worst line of them all, which, mind you, IS NOT A LINE, merely a blatant reference as to justify that this film is something it's not, is one referring to \"a f'ing George A. Romery movie,\" and that's coming from some character who wouldn't know the first thing about what makes a zombie action flick great. As far as the acting itself goes, you have one Asian girl, who, oddly enough, manages to handle two desert eagles while the one guy on their crew apparently has trouble handling one, and when it came down to the bullet-time and Matrix-esquire shots being used throughout the action, you found that same exact duel-wielding girl to be too scared to do anything about the Security Council of Living Dead Creatures one second, and see her going Neo on a ton of them the next... some \"scared-out-of-her-wits\" character.Then there's the action... what action? What is there to find in this movie that we haven't seen from Lord of the Rings, Jaws, Das Boot, Pearl Harbor, Star Trek, and even and especially the Matrix? Absolutely nothing. The action scene preceding the human invasion of the \"House\" of the Dead had the potential to be good or perhaps the only thing that could potentially save this movie from all-out crapdom, but when you watch it, you will find that it's nothing but constant blatant ripping of the Matrix, foreplay of clips from the video game used throughout, camera spins around each character as they are shooting, and worst of all, you will find that the same zombie is being shot a dozen times... wow, that sounds like great entertainment... yeah, to a mentally-challenged, brain dead pubescent teenager who likes whatever he sees. For instance, a bullet. He sees a bullet fly, bullet-time style as to copy the Matrix, and rips a tiny manhole in a zombie's flesh... nice try, Uwe Boll. You may please Little Johnny with your horribly distorted and not even remotely well put-together action scenes, but you're not impressing anyone who's been a fan and follower of zombie flicks since George Romero's heyday. Sorry, you're not. You may think that you are, but as a die-hard fan of zombie horror, I can tell you that you aren't.But the area where this film fails worst at is the story. Even barring the fact that it has little-or-no correlation to the game whatsoever, you are pretty much left with a story coming from something you might see on a Saturday Morning TV show. You have a group of all-but-smart twentysomethings who make a trip to the supposed \"Rave of the Year\" which, to the viewer's dismay, has a bunch of Asian women dancing in front of a banner on stage of the Sega logo who strip-at-random. As a matter of fact, the first few scenes of this tragic movie involve women who strip for no apparent reason, just to try to appeal to the audience in ways which later are thwarted by an uncanny premise of some incidental coincidence which was all-but-waiting to happen by they the audience themselves, which plays as the sole culprit of the tragedy at hand: the island is completely deserted and there's blood everywhere. And just what would a normal teen do in that situation? Just ask yourselves that before taking the time and bravery out of your cue to watch this film.Even the title itself is insulting. As the name kindly--or unkindly--suggests, the premise of the film is based solely on a house crawling with spirits of the dead, which sparks yet another question in itself: house? What \"house\"? This \"house\" is nothing but a shack that's much larger on the inside than out and shares no symbolism to the Curien Mansion in the best-selling Sega game whatsoever, which is the culprit of this mess, a mess too sizable for any director to clear up, unfortunately.The verdict: this movie is TRAGIC, to say the least. It teaches no lesson to be told and bears no motive other than the fact that it's premise is detrimental to the cause of the game. All things considered, this could quite possibly be the worst film ever made. I rented it for free, and still felt ripped off.0 STARS! I know as well as anyone who thought the same about this movie as I did that the least that I can give this so-called \"movie\" is a 1-star rating, but that's what it TRULY deserves!",

Why do we have those corny inserts of the video game into the film every time we cut to a different scene? Oh scenes over, lets put in this dull colorful game clip so we can adjust our plot.

Of course, in a movie featuring characters named \"Liberty,\" \"Tyranny\" and \"Karma\" attending the 'ultimate rave' (which is hosted by the now defunct 'Sega') on an island nicknamed \"Isla del Mort\" by the sea fearing folk who never sail there (how the original revelers got there is a mystery...), what can you expect.Everything in this movie is annoying- from the ridiculous opening narration by Jonathan Cherry introducing us to, among others, a dumb as a stump Simon (Tyron Leitso), his jerk friend Greg (Will Sanderson), and a host of others I really never cared about. They slot into characters in a video game that is fun for all of about two seconds, shooting, kicking, axing and then ultimately dying so that Jonathan Cherry can assume the title of sole survivor and tell the tale in his monotone voice.I'd like to summarize what the story is about, but in the absence of a story, I think the best way to summarize is this: Alicia broke up with Rudy to get serious about school. Then Rudy goes to the rave, and Alicia isn't serious enough about school so she goes to the rave too with Simon, who likes her, Karma, who likes him, Greg, who likes himself, and a blond girl who likes sex. They arrive even though the Captain told him they wouldn't take them to the island, and along with a group of other survivors, they shoot, kick, slash and punch until the dead kill everyone but Rudy.Sound stupid? Now inject the film with slow motion, different angles, and yes, even images from the video game, and what you have is the ultimate in stupid, ridiculous films. The tag line says \"the dead walk,\" but that's not true at all because \"the dead\" look like rejects from gymnastics floor routines, complete with running, jumping, and swinging weapons.Some blame the writer, but he's not the one to blame.

A very long music video with a thin plot and laughable characters. So I have an idea for you. Instead of calling yourself a director, and saying you make movies, you can call yourself a 'thing-maker', and just say you make things. Because I will be perfectly honest with you, they sure aren't movies.Several times while watching this 'thing', I asked myself if you were really there with the actors, directing it, or if you walked away and took a coffee break, took a day off, or, perhaps, went on vacation. You certainly have money to take a break, because the production companies are handing you money to make these 'things'.See, you accept scripts that have NOTHING to do with the storyline of the video game itself. It's a difficult task, I know. But when you make things like this that has a fan base, you have to take a care that you don't alienate that fan base. If there isn't enough of a budget, then I suggest you don't make the 'thing', or perhaps do something else constructive with the small budget that you have. Because actors that have no idea how to act, redundant special effects, and general chaos of a crapped on script just doesn't bring in the audience, Uwe. Also, splicing in scenes of the Sega video game that your 'thing' is based on was a bad idea. The real problem comes when we see these video game clips over and over again, like as if they made your thing better. I'll give your thing a 2, Uwe. There were some OK splatter-gore scenes, and yes, you did tell several of your actresses to take off their clothes. And that's all I could say about your 'thing', because there are other filmmakers that make low budget horror films that are much better at doing sex and violence. Now, please stop making your 'things'.",

I also enjoyed the several shots of topless women. Hey, it's a horror flick, it has to fulfill its quota.  The acting is wooden and far from great, but it's not bad either.  Veteran actors Clint Howard and Jurgen Prochnow help add some class to the predominantly young cast.  If you get your hands on the DVD, it has a good commentary by the cast and crew.

Usually making a movie on a computer game is a risky deal, and in this case the scale tipped towards the bad end. The end result was sort of unbearable. Had they decided NOT to have to constant flashes from the computer game put into the movie it would have worked so much better. It was frustrating and downright annoying having these flashes appear over and over throughout the movie.As for the story. Well, it was sort of alright, weak plot line though, and not really fully thought through. There were some nice key elements in it, but the overall picture was too sloppy.The acting was mediocre at best, with a bunch of really horrible ones thrown into the midst, making it a very strange combination of performances to look at. And also the characters people were given were vain and not really fleshed out, offering the actors/actresses little to work with.I liked the scenery and settings in the movie, they were nice enough, good details and seemed dark and sinister enough to actually work.On to the zombies. Well there were a lot of inspiration taken from the old Italian zombie movies, giving the movie sort of a cheesy touch. Zombie movies of recent make should not have that kind of \"retro\" feel to it, it just doesn't work. And then some of the zombies had good make up and looked cool enough. Personally, I get ticked off with the whole \"let's have zombies running\" thing. Reanimated corpses should not be agile and running around. That was another push backward for the movie.I think it was a good attempt from Boll to put his touch on the House of the Dead game series, but the movie just came out less than perfect. I have rated this movie 4, because it is a zombie movie after all, and it does have its moments in the plot and the effects. But this is nothing spectacular, and there are far many better zombie movies available out there. But if you are a hardcore zombie fan like myself, you should take a peek at \"House of the Dead\".",

Oh no! this is a film that we have talked about - not only in the long car journey back to our humble small town - but on numerous occasions at our local, college and with others who have yet to see this delightful feast of zombism.It is to my shame that I can only claim to have seen this film once as firstly I did not wish to view it again at the multiplex for fear it would not make me laugh with such a relish as in my first sitting and secondly due to a lack of a DVD release date. Get it sorted executive types!! this is cult classic in the making.You may have seen this film and hated it. My advice to you is forget everything you know about what makes a good movie and sit back, relax and enjoy a slice of Gratuitous over acting, pointless nudity and unapologetic ripoffs of all your favourite action films. The Wachowski brother had better get their lawyers ready for this one as it mimics the matrix's moves with unbelievable incompetenceA sense of humour is required and rewarded! oh by the way its not a comedy but who cares? FUNNY IS FUNNY!",

Boll truly gives directors a bad name!And what the hell is Jurgen Prochnow (Das Boot, Beverly Hills Cop 2, Air Force One) doing in there? How he has fallen!

            "content": "This is the worst zombie movie I've ever seen and one of the worst movies of all time. Directed by the infamous Uwe Boll, this train wreck of a movie is full of unintentional laughs, plot holes, silly dialogues and awful acting. Every aspect of the movie is completely disastrous and it's safe to say that House of the Dead has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. The constant referencing to other, better movies (Jaws, Rain Man, LOTR, The Elephant Man, Matrix\u0085) doesn't help either. Also, I don't understand how J\u00fcrgen Prochnow, the star of the great classic movie Das Boot, landed a role in this pile of nonsense. The name of his character is Kirk, and he is a captain. I'm not kidding you.Anyway, House of the Dead is based on an arcade game of the same name. I'm not familiar with the game but I'm going to guess that the movie's plot is in no way connected to the game's storyline \u2013 something so inane as this movie's synopsis could only exist in an Uwe Boll movie. Since it's based on a game, Uwe Boll, for some reason, decided to put video clips from the original game into the movie, 32 of them. As a result, the movie's action is often interrupted by the video game clips. I don't know why would anyone in their right mind do such a thing, but that only proves that Uwe Boll has the directing abilities of a mentally challenged monkey. Back to the plot: a group of friends want to get to a rave party on an island named the Island of Death. They are somehow late for the boat that is supposed to take them there, so they pay a big amount of money to a suspicious captain who does. When they arrive, they notice no one is there and the spot were the party was meant to take place is covered in blood. Nonetheless, they decide to get drunk and have sex.It's noteworthy to mention that the protagonist and the narrator of the story (whose opening narration kind of spoils the movie) doesn't show up until a half an hour into the movie. Not only is the protagonist a problem \u2013 the antagonist is atrocious as well. The villain is an immortal Spanish priest named Castillo who, by using some mutated blood (this is never fully resolved), resurrects the dead. His actions, goals and motivations are never thoroughly explained. Of course, there is the scene where a character asks him why did he become immortal. To live forever!, Castillo replies. This exchange of unintentionally hilarious dialogue is as far as Castillo's development goes.In the third act of the movie, there is an action sequence which runs for about 10 minutes or so (in case you're interested, the duration of the whole movie is 90 minutes). This sequence could have been OK, if it weren't for the aforementioned video game clips interrupting it and for the disgraceful editing. Eventually, House of the Dead ends just like it started \u2013 as a messy train wreck of a movie that should be ignored for the rest of eternity.Rating: 1/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/",

            "content": "House of the Dead (2003) BOMB (out of 4) The story is very simple, which is always a good thing for a B-rate zombie film. Five punks from Seattle head off to a Tropical island for what's being called the biggest rave party in the history of rave parties. After missing the boat they find a drunken Captain Kirk willing to take them there but he warns them that the place is cursed and death will follow. Of course they should listen to him but characters in horror films are stupid so they go to the island anyways. When they arrive on the island everyone from the party is missing and before you know it zombies start popping up from all sides. Thankfully Captain Kirk was smuggling illegal weapons so the good guys load up to take on the zombies in a blood match to the re-death.Once again, I had read how incredibly awful this film was but sometimes I think horror fans just join the fun in bashing a film that usually doesn't deserve it. As for myself, I can't help but recommend this film to every single person in the world. Everyone should buy a copy of this film and share it with their friends, family, lovers, enemies and even their local priests. Yes, everyone should see this movie and even if you must steal it, see this movie at once. Why? Because this is without a doubt one of the worst films ever made. I'm sure you've read about how bad this was but all that reading could never possibly prepare you for what we have here. Calling a film like this bad would be insulting the word bad. Calling it awful would be like calling Martin Scorsese a wannabe Ed Wood. However, House of the Dead does make history in the fact that it beats out Astro Zombies as the worst zombie film ever made.With a film this bad you'd expect everything in it from the acting to the screenplay to the effects to be bad but that's actually not the case. In fact, I'd be willing to say that the acting is no worse than your typical horror film and the gore effects, while far from Tom Savini, are actually fairly decent. Even the screenplay has a somewhat decent story that has an easy setup for gore and violence to follow. It's even smart enough to throw in some good looking naked girls so what went wrong? I hate to beat a dead horse but the direction by Uwe Boll is what totally destroyed this movie. The first zombie film was 1932's White Zombie and in the seventy-two years of zombie films I can't think of a single one where everything bad was due to the direction. I might even go a bit further saying I've never seen a film where everything went so incredibly wrong all due to the direction.For some unknown reason director Boll tries to mix a Lucio Fulci zombie film with CGI zombie action, which seems like leftovers from The Matrix. The flying in the air/karate/zombie action scenes are so incredibly bad that I had to turn my head and watch my ceiling fan do its job. I'm sure this could have been pulled off with a better director but it seems like Boll was trying to impress the viewer and telling us how great a job he's doing but instead of coming off stylish or cool then entire thing become very annoying and irritating. Imagine a mosquito bite that you can't help but scratch for a few weeks and you'll understand trying to watch one minute of these action scenes. Even worse is a showdown at the end where our \"heroes\" must fight their way into a cabin. There are so many quick edits, fast motion zombies and rocking music that my head was spinning as if I had just drank a few kegs of beer before eating raw fish. I've seen thousands and thousands of films in my life but I can't recall a worst moment in my life.Another incredibly silly thing has clips from the video game being thrown into the film. Again, what was the point of this? Did the director think it would be cool? Was he trying to remind us this was based on a game? Was he trying to make us want to go buy the game? I'm still not too certain why we got clips from the video game and I'm sure no one else, including the director knows why. There's not even any direction when it comes to the zombies. I'm not looking for too much logic in a horror film but there needs to be some sort of playing ground when it comes to the zombies. These zombies seem to be able to be killed in any sort of manor, which is a major no-no in my book. The typical rule is that you shoot them in the head to kill them. In this film, I swear I could see one getting killed after being shot in the knee. Some die from stab wounds, some die from having their heads blown off and I'm sure several died from pure boredom.However, I'm sure you've read plenty of negative reviews of this film before so you should see mine as nothing different. In fact, I hope you'll be like me and blow these reviews off and view the movie for yourself. I really hope more people check this film out because, once again, you'll never know how bad this film is until you actually see it for yourself.",

They are pursued by a local Coast Guard officer. None of them know that the island has been invaded by zombies. They arrive to find the place trashed and seemingly abandoned.This Uwe Boll film is generally a low grade B-movie adapted from a video game. His reputation is well deserved. His camera work is amateurish and flat. One particular sequence almost made me seasick. At first, I thought it to be artistic shaky camera but it's more likely sea swell shaking the docks. His filming of the kills are really poor with no tension. It's got all the hallmarks of a bad B-movie. The zombie makeup is student level. The unimaginative story is flat and convoluted at the same time. The actors are mostly fine TV level workers but nobody is winning any awards in this one. The actresses have boobs and some of them show them off. You may recognize Erica Durance from Smallville. The bad movie list is almost entirely checked off. There are sequences of game play weirdly inserted into the movie to accentuate the Sega game. The spinning action scenes do nothing but get boring and dizzying. It's a Matrix wannabe fail.

            "content": "I had no idea this was based on a video game until I started watching it. So I guess I'm not included in the video game fan category for this movie.I'm not one to give away any of the plot, and basically you don't need to know about the plot to see a zombie flick, but the zombies in this movie are not generic randomly raised zombies. There's a possibility that some of these zombies are 400-500 years old.The zombies in this movie do not need to be shot in the head to be killed. Unlike older traditional zombie flicks, these zombies move quick (like in 28 Days later) but are quite a bit more methodical. As well they can use melee weapons. Certainly some of the most vicious zombies around.Ona Grauer was overwhelmingly sexy throughout the film. J\u00fcrgen Prochnow is excellent in his role. Ellie Cornell didn't seem comfortable in her role, but it doesn't take away from the movie and she did well in the action scenes. Clint Howard played his part well, and while the character was somewhat useful in the plot (certainly the whistling scenes were good additions), the character was mostly annoying (likely a writer/director flaw, not the actor's). The others were all quite adequate and each had something good to add to the flick. They should all be able to get more work easily.It's no blockbuster but is certainly an entertaining zombie flick. A bunch of nobodies become excellent zombie destroyers. It has some really nifty clips that circle the characters which was very well done (and hopefully not overly copied into other movies like the Matrix effect).The action clips were far more realistic than most modern action movies. Slow motion dodges by the martial artist actually followed the rules of physics and weren't done with any big special effects (No running up trees here or ridiculous bending over backwards so your head can tap the floor and back up). The stop action and slow-motion was very well placed and not overused.There are numerous video game clips in the movie which sorely take away from the movie and were a really bad idea. As well the narration isn't spoken clearly. Oh,and don't count the bullets fired - they won't add up.Certainly this movie has more energy and flow then most zombie movies. It doesn't have much creepiness though. This is more of a fun zombie action movie than a horror flick.Think of it as the first Resident Evil without the slower spots. This is pretty non-stop action.From a mainstream movie point of view, there will be some silly aspects to this movie, but from a B-Movie-Zombie-flick point of view, it should be in any zombie collection.The actual premise and deeper plot of the movie has quite a bit of potential. Certainly more could have been made with the plot, but it was fun nevertheless.I'll buy it.",

            "content": "For some reason studio's seem to keep being obsessed with wanting to make video game adaptations into film. Now, there is probably not even a single example of this in which it actually turns out to be a success, and House of the Dead is no different. Actually, it is different, because it is even worse than every other single adaptations you could think about. The biggest problem with this big piece of garbage is the fact that it doesn't even understand that it is a film. It is made like some kind of un-interactive videogame kind of thing with actors in it. The most ridiculous part about this film ( And trust me, there are A LOT ) is definitely the fact that the director deems it necessary to actually add shots of the arcade videogame between edits for no apparent reason, except perhaps to tell us that we are watching a videogame. And even though this is a 'film' with actual people and locations, it seems director Uwe Boll did a great job because the entire atmospheric feel of this film makes it seem like a brainless arcade videogame. Yeah, Uwe Boll is horrible. What was even the point of making a movie like this? the shots of the game between edits simply prove that this doesn't even seem to want to be a film. There is no point. Nothing makes any sense. Uwe Boll is terrible.The acting is as to be expected with a bunch of stereotypical cheesy teenagers horrendously bad. However, a lot of horror/slasher like films have this horrendous cast of actors, but they are still at least never as bad as House of the Dead. The writing is non existent. There is no character development, the characters have no defining traits. Every one of the character does completely random things that do not fit in with a lot of other things they would do. For example, one character actually seems smart enough to question the circumstances of the Island after nobody's there, but after seeing live footage of the zombies killing people, she somehow says it's all a fake. I'm not even joking, this literally happens. This screenplay is absolutely abysmal. Every one of the characters is incredibly stupid. None of them have an ounce of intelligence. Nearly every one of them will try to deny anything is wrong when the obvious facts are that there is something wrong. It is really saddening to see the great Jurgen Prochnow in this pile of garbage. He is a great actor, but he was terrible as Kirk, which also further tells me that even though most of the other actors are pretty bad, the biggest fault here lies with the terrible script, because nobody seems to want to be there.The original score is an ear piercing electronic noise that makes your ears bleed and this is combined with a lot of garbage rap music that makes it even worse. Every single line of dialogue is just plain garbage. My favorite has to be \n'You created it all so you could become immortal. Why?' followed by the in-depth fantastic amazing reply: 'To live forever!'. Yes. This is actually something that is said in this film, believe it or not.However, the worst scene of them all has to be the extremely absurd and idiotic simultaneous shootout before the 'House of the Dead'. The ship captain 'Kirk' (....) ofcourse has about 200 guns stashed away in his boat behind a little wooden board which has somehow never been found by the police patrol there. All of these dumb and moronic teenagers and some wooden emotionless policewoman take these guns and now suddenly they are some kind of superheroes. They start jumping around and using martial arts to take these things down whereas a scene before they could barely figure out what was left and what was right. This scene is one of the worst scenes ever made. It has terrible music, terrible choreography, an overuse of slow motion ( Including a lot of shots following bullets.... which was obviously not a Matrix ripoff....Yeah. ), terrible cinematography and it goes on forever and ever. The spinning of the camera around the characters, the sudden 'Coolness' they get when they were a couple of morons the entire film before that, the repetitive shots of zombie heads being blown apart... It is just absolutely terrible.It doesn't get any worse than this. It isn't particularly a very likeable bad movie either, but its ridiculousness does provoke some laughs at times. In any case, it is still the lowest of the lowest and deserves to be in the garbage can of cinematic achievements. Actually, it doesn't even deserve to be mentioned in the same sentence as garbage cans. That's how bad this is.",

It happened to me with In the Name of the King, which I rather enjoyed. And there's The Bride of the Monster, which does have some stupid moments and pacing issues, but I still don't view it as catastrophic. Manos: The Hands of Fate is bad, but I respect Harold Warren for creating a movie without any kind of education in film.So, let's turn to House of the Dead. The first 20-25 minutes were quite good. The movie begins with a short and not-too-informative introduction to the four teens that wish to get to some island, and have fun with friends there. Some, who are pickier about movies than I am, say that characters are best introduced through action than any narration, but not much is revealed about them, so it's no big deal. The dialog sequence aboard the ship was clever, funny, and served its purpose of establishing the characters, especially the captain.Many complained about the characters' decision to stay at the deserted camp instead of running away, but please note that all but Alicia was drunk, so don't expect them to make rational decisions. Was Alicia's decision to go investigate rational? No, it wasn't, but the movie had to move forward, didn't it?The movie went on, and I haven't gotten the impression that it was as bad as the reviews suggested it was. It looked like a typical horror movie, and it continued and ended that way. There are dark places, zombies sneaking in the forest, characters getting introduced (and killed), a hooded figure in the distance observing the humans, etc. The usual horror move stuff.Possibly weakest part of the movie is the big shoot-out scene in front of the house. It's spectacular, but way too long. They kill zombies by the dozens, and not much else happens. One may argue that the battle scenes in The Lord of the Rings trilogy are even longer, but there are twists in them that serve a narrative purpose.Also everyone aims perfectly, and they don't run out of ammo until the plot requires them to. Neither is an unheard-of plot device, but since the fight is very long, it becomes noticeable.I also don't understand the narrative purpose of the in-game clips. It would have been better if Boll left them out entirely.Surely, HotD isn't a *good* movie, but I fail to see why it received so much flak. I basically mentioned everything I disliked about HotD, and that's all I could find in a 90-minute-long movie. There are things I liked as well. Pacing is generally good, the dialogs are decent, acting is surprisingly good for a movie with this average rating. The flaws don't outweigh the pros, so I give it a 6.",

When watching, just keep asking yourself this: \"who the hell would do that?\" Every character decision in this movie makes no logical sense.

I really hated the first half of it, when the group of B actors first get on the island and realize that something killed all the other people there. But it really started to turn around for me at the beginning of the zombie killing spree. The whole flashback to the actual video game bothered me at first, but then when they included them into the huge killing sequence it only added to the effect for me. Even some of the characters started to get on my good side, like the stupid male model Simon, Liberty the American flag wearing ninja warrior and the sluttily dressed brunette. Yes a lot of parts in this movie were very cheesy and poorly thought out but, all in all I'd have to say that this is quite a fun piece work. If you are looking for something that doesn't require any thinking what so ever, but is fun, great to play Mystery Science Theater to (recommended by Buddy3_16), and contains well done gore shots with cool looking zombies then I would recommend this movie for you :) 4/10",

Just when you see the Matrix bullet-time special effect used just about everywhere it pops up again and again and yet again to the point you start to wonder if it's just filler to stretch the movie's run time out. Not unlike the method employed by Bruno Mattei in Hell of the Living Dead with stock footage of native tribes and wildlife. As much of a hack work Hell of the Living Dead is, it's a masterpiece compared to House of the Dead. Tired cinematography reused under the guise of a fresh hip living dead movie. The only surprise the movie held was the appearance of Jurgen Prochnow, a favorite of mine from Dune and Das Boot. He seems to walk through the role which is an extended Das Boot joke anyway and has smackings of 'did it for the money' all over him. House of the Dead is no masterpiece and has several shortcomings but is not the worst zombie movie I've ever seen. It just failed to add anything to the genre of note.",

The terrible kind that bore the heck out of you and make you fall asleep and 2. The kind that is just soooooo stupid that it's actually funny.For me, House of the Dead was the second choice.

            "content": "~Spoiler~House of the Dead...horrible...atrocious...lame...classic?  I went to the theater with four friends expecting a god-awful flick.  However, that's what I wanted.  We were the only ones present for the matinee so we gave it the Mystery Science Theater treatment.  House of the Dead is the funniest movie I've watched in quite some time.  It's of the so-bad-it's-good variety and I had an absolute blast watching this movie.  The humor is all unintentional of course.  Let me explain: The movie takes place at the biggest rave in history yet it looks like a cookout in my backyard.  There are about twenty people present, maybe.  I was rolling for about 10 minutes.  And the storyline kills me as well.  Who sent out the invitations to this rave? It's never explained.  How are the walking dead suddenly Olympic swimmers? I didn't know the movie was going to be dealing with Matrix zombies. These deadheads run, jump, swim, and even use weapons.  How did some of this dialogue ever make it to the screen?  Dave Parker's (The Dead Hate the Living) script is missing some ingredients to say the least.  This isn't word for word, but pretty damn close:Rudy: \"Why did you do all this so you could become immortal?\"Castillo: \"So I could live forever.\"Well, that's a tad bit redundant.  He also drops Romero's name as well just to show the fans he knows his stuff.  Also, there is one mention about the heroine being able to fence in the opening voice-over.  So we're supposed to remember that one throw-away line at the very end of the film when she has an \"epic\" sword fight with the villain.  Nice.  I'm used to better work from Mr. Parker.  Oh, and there's bullet time sword play as well.  Speaking of bullet time, let me talk about the director Uwe Boll.  Boll has intercut actual video game footage into the film and makes good use of the 80's swipe.  There is a ten minute music video in the middle of the movie.  The song is about the House of the Dead and we're shown numerous bullet time slo-mo and each character gets their own gun play scene.  Let me try to explain these: the character is shown shooting away at the oncoming zombies, then the camera completely revolves around them in slow motion.  This was done at least seven times and it didn't even look that good.  I'm telling you we were all on the floor laughing.  Then, our hero has a flashback montage of everything that's just happened.  We get to see all of this again while the song is still playing.  And that is just hinting at no-no's in the film.  The cast camps it up as well, especially Clint Howard (The Wraith). It was nice to see Clint on the big screen but man he just screams \"camp.\" His performance oozes cheese but he's not the only one.  Jurgen Prochnow, cigar in mouth, knows he's not in Das Boot (even though they refer to him as a U-boat captain).  Ellie Cornell (Halloween 4 and 5) tries her best but I'm not really buying it.  The real winner in the cast is Jonathan Cherry (Final Destination 2).  This guy plays his role straight and that takes the movie to a whole new level of hilarity.  I like this kid since this is his third genre movie.  He has a Bruce Campbell quality about him and I hope to see more of him in the future.  Another odd thing was the character name's: Captain Kirk, Casper, and McGuyvers.  So, yes, there's numerous Star Trek jokes.  So, why am I going to buy this movie when it hits DVD?  Because it entertained me.  Sometimes a very bad movie can be just as much fun as a hit comedy.  I predict House of the Dead will be a cult classic within a few years.",

Well, Uwe Boll made a movie out of that. If you don't know who Uwe Boll is, he's the director of this movie and widely considered one of the worst directors out there. He's also known for challenging Critics who didn't like he movies to a boxing match. Anyway, on to \"House of the Dead\"I'll spoil the plot of the movie for you. There's a island full of zombies, teenagers go to it and die. The End. Every plot-point that happens in the movie, I could see coming from a mile away. It's the most predictable and basic of Horror movies, and it wasn't scary in the slightest. The characters are so annoying and one-dimensional that even is they actors were any good (which they're not), they still wouldn't be able to pull it off. The writing in this film reminds me of how I used to write movies... when I was seven. The music is horrible. It sounds less like music and more like inconsistent noise. Overall, this is a horrible film and one of many horrible films made by Uwe Boll. 2/10",

Sure, if you are an inexperienced directing and writing team, you can point at the success of Resident Evil (Resident Evil 2 forthcoming) and Mortal Kombat movies. I'll bet the project was further justified by the huge revenue generated by this title for game systems and in the arcade. However, unlike RE and MK, HofD is merely a button- mashing or trigger-pulling video game. The game lacks storyline depth and this movie does as well. The problem is that a video game is a video game and a movie is a movie, period!!! For example, one of the zombie-killing scenes in the movie goes on and on and on, while characters twirl in circles waiting to be your chosen player for game play. The problem is you're not playing a video game, next scene please. Why are people kissing in this movie when the writers didn't develop the characters or the storyline enough to justify such nonsense. Makes me wonder-How could the teen-slasher formula be so badly interpreted? Sega logos in the background?, it's not a commercial. Special features? pure space-fillers. For example, why would the women of HofD need to train to kill zombies, when even in the movie they are simply pulling the trigger. What a joke!!!

It's clear how the director felt though \"we have no story, but get enough breasts on screen and noone will notice\" I mean the chest shots are gratuitous to say the least, and y'know that's the norm with most horror films, but can't we have some sort of attempt at a story? And the acting! The zombies move just like those grey things from the Power Rangers TV series. It's really pretty difficult to tell the zombies from the non-zombies, everyone has the same dull tone when they read their lines. Actually, come to think of it, the zombies are generally far more active and enthusiastic than their supposedly human counterparts.The special effects are absolutely laughable, they really should have invested in some digital effects for this one, the latex body gear is so naff! I was shocked and stunned when I found out that the film really was made in 2003, I thought it had to be an early 90s flick at least for that low a standard of FX.The ending is a kick in the teeth. A helicopter lands, picks up the last two victims, some government types mill around and do the whole \"we're in charge thing\" albeit unbelievably half-heartedly, a few lame lines are exchanged and then its off to a shot of the sea and the hero repeating a lame soliloquy about how awful it all was. ...I must say, I agree with him entirely on that point.Sega really shot themselves in the foot by plastering their name all over this picture.In short, I want 90 minutes of my life back!",

There's always enough going on to keep you watching while they're setting up the next howler of a scene, and any such expectation is never disappointed.This is an uncompromising, take-it-or-leave-it work of a singular artistic vision and bizarro genius. Judging it as a video game adaptation, or horror flick or whatever, is beside the point. In the right frame of mind you can't go wrong with this hilarious movie. But it's the little things that really make the difference, e.g. when suddenly the name of the raver-girl character, whose costume is patterned after an American flag, is revealed for the first time to be \"Liberty,\" after she's attacked by a monster late in the story (Guy: \"No!!!

Well certainly this wasn't a very top notch movie. But it was to a degree a pretty well done B-movie. Up to the final act that is.The opening and the narrative actually build up quite nicely. The dialog was certainly not great but very amusing to listen to. The characters are what you would expect from a B-flick, but most of them were very fun. Boll's weakness is apparent in the first big battle with the zombies. What plagues the latter half of the film is his complete lack of subtlety. I doubt he can be held accountable for inconsistent make-up as the production values of this film were obviously very low, but inserting romantic scenes where they don't belong is just cheesy to me.There is quite a bit of redundant shots in the second half of the film and the few shots that would actually have some emotional content (such as Simon's sacrifice) are blown flat by these more ridiculous shots. Also there was a definite over-dose on explosions, slow-mo and CGI bullets where as these elements were still somewhat more consistent in the first half.All in all, this is not a great movie, but a fun movie which would have had the potential of being a pretty good movie had Boll restrained himself a little bit more in the second half.As to the film's relation to the game.

            "content": "This is a truly terrible movie, and could only possibly appeal to people like myself who get a good laugh out of bad movies.  Make no mistake, this one is hilarious.There were so many continuity problems in this movie that I lost count.  One character, for example, falls and gets his hand impaled.  Yet minutes later in movie time, this has apparently been forgotten.  He's walking around with full use of both hands and doesn't have so much as a hole in the glove that got a huge nail rammed through it just a couple of scenes before.It's THAT bad.The characters are on an island.  At one point, the scene is cutting back and forth between a trashed rave and activities on the beach.  On the beach, it's raining.  At the rave site, it's dry.It's THAT bad.The script was awful.  It was as if the writers attempted to cram every movie cliche ever imagined into one turkey of a film.  At various points, the following lines are ALL uttered:  \"It's quite out there.\" \"Too quiet.\"\"Not who... what.\"\"What part of shove off don't you understand.\"Yes, it's THAT bad.The camera work was particularly nauseating.  Many of the shots spin around like your room after you've polished off that second pint of Jack Daniels. It goes around and around and around, faster and faster, until everything resolves into one big puddle of puke.  One of the characters near the beginning of the film vomits over the side of the boat bringing them to the rave island.  The water is absolutely calm, however.  I can only conclude that his nausea was the result of having watched several action sequences in rapid succession.Even the editing was horrible.  At one point, various images and sounds are flashing by in just such a way as to make me get up and make sure that something wasn't wrong with the DVD I'd rented.  Throughout the film, too, there are quick images from the actual video game.  They're sometimes used as transition sequences.  This makes the movie violate the laws of physics by sucking and blowing at the same time.At least the special effects were something, right?  Wrong. At one point, we can clearly see the springboard device used by a leaping zombie.  I zoomed in on it and watched the device operate in slow motion.  Fascinating.  I find it hard to believe that the editor missed this glaringly obvious bit of machinery.Yet I can't give this gawd-awful movie a truly bad review, because I found myself laughing out loud at several points.  This is not only a stinker, but it's a classic stinker.  It's wonderfully horrible.Really, it's THAT bad.",

            "content": "As a campy, trashy low-budget horror House of the Dead is pretty good. In any other company it's a woefully inept movie that'll have nothing to offer you except a lot of exuberantly directed carnage. It has a laughably bad plot, a cast that wavers between joyfully overacting and leadenly dispensing cheesy one-liners and a horde of rubber zombies just waiting to tear a strip off an island full of scantily clad ravers.But, firstly, scantily clad ravers aside, the original game didn't have much else than that previous list, and going back to the first comment, as STV horror, this is pretty good. The actors are bad, yes, but we do have vets Jurgen Prochnow (gleefully hamming it up as the unfortunately named Captain 'No more Captain Kirk jokes' Kirk) and Clint Howard, and the teens don't have to do an awful lot of emoting so all's well that ends well on that front. Also, House of the Dead has a lot of gory, punchy action, directed with a good level of energy, and that high-camp X Factor that can turn a really dodgy ropey movie into a 'so bad, it's good' joy. Add to that decent zombie make-up and a random storyline about a mad scientist mutating humans in a jungle lab and you've got a great midnight movie.I enjoyed House of the Dead a lot. It alleviated the boredom of a rainy Saturday, it's silly, over the top and full of guns and zombies. Still, Citizen Kane it ain't. The first half-hour drags in a way only STVs manage, i.e. nothing happens, in a very boring fashion, except for a few girls getting their twins out, which is normally not much to shout about with these casts anyway. Once the last 30 or 40 minutes are on, it's rubber-suited zombie ass-kicking all the way, but there could be a problem with that. Uwe Boll's direction is a GIANT HUGE sticking point with many people, and I can see why on viewing this. In-game footage of zombie attacks is edited into the live footage and whenever a key character dies instead of getting a zombie-nosh death scene, it cuts to a weird spinning camera shot of the character, like a 'Game Over' screen. It's a strange way of building in the video-game heritage, and it's often as annoying than it is inventive.Continuity is also a word that's obviously not in this movie's dictionary. I'm not talking 'hey, how the hell did Jason manage to get over there so fast' continuity errors, I'm talking 'I pointed two guns at the screen but when it cut to me shooting you I blew you away with a Shotgun'. Another thing that gave me some jip was a scene where a character comments on someone's choice of zombie-masher 'Hmm, Desert Eagle, nice...' and the character's holding some random prop gun, obviously bought from Toys R Us the night before. It wouldn't have been irritating, but earlier a character shoots some zombies with an ACTUAL Desert Eagle prop, so they had one on-set, why not give the character one and not look daft? Still, labouring on a point there.These movies aren't about how well they're put together, they're about how much fun they are. HotD gets a big thumbs up on that front, and I have to say as STV goes, it's up there with the best of 'em. I haven't seen any other Boll movies, but despite some initial fears, HotD is a hoot. Not a particularly big, clever hoot, but a hoot. If you view this for what it is, a camp, gory low budget zombie-blaster, it's great fun. It won't set your world on fire, but you'll at least be entertained.",

The zombies did not attack those who have come on the named island to prepare the site for the fancy party; but they attack, even on daylight, the party-goers. There are some verbal hints to the popular culture (the Romero trilogy; a Tolkien character, Kirk and Spock, etc.) .Ona Grauer plays an energetic, strong and lucid character; her cleavage is beautiful.HOUSE OF THE DEAD is an insipid, highly artificial ,hyperkinetic ,deliberately kitsch thriller.

When a group of bloodthirsty zombies comes to kill or eat them alive. Now these group of kids along with a boat captain (Jurgen Prochnow) and a marine police officer (Ellie Cornell) battle the undead to stay alive.Directed by Uwe Boll (Alone in the Dark, BloodRayne, Postal) made an another instant Camp Classic film with plenty of ridiculous humour, first class bad acting but at least... it has some exciting action sequences and good make-up effects. This is one of Boll's most entertaining film along with \"Dungenon Siege\". Prochnow gives the film's best performance and he seems to be having some fun in the movie but he was unhappy with the script changes during production. Cult B-Movie Actor:Clint Howard appears in a small role as the skipper. This film was an small success in theaters but find itself instead cult audiences on DVD, for those who enjoyed bad movies.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and an strong DTS 5.1 Surround Sound (Also in Dolby Digital 5.1). DVD includes two entertaining commentary tracks by the filmmakers. Commentary one is by the director, crew members and actor:Sanderson. The Second Commentary by the Executive Producer/Story/Co-Screenwriter:Mark A. Altman is the most enjoyable to listen. DVD also includes Deleted Scenes, Two Featurettes and more. \"House of the Dead\" is a enjoyable bad movie but there's one thing... i truly hated in this feature is Boll's use of showing video game footage every couple of minutes or so. It relies too heavily on reminding viewers, we are watching an live-action video game. Since this feature was shot on Super 35, which it was seen in theaters in the 2.35:1 aspect ratio. Probably in the Uwe Boll's new re-cut of \"House of the Dead:Funny Version\" will might see it in the original 2.35:1 format. Which it's coming out soon on DVD.

            "content": "The only review of this one I really read was one on Ain't it Cool news (a site I'm trying to break the habit of visiting) where the guy simply repeated the words \"sucked\" over and over again.While I kept that in mind as i rented this one, you should keep something else in mind before you read this.1. I love zombie movies. Yes, I'm one of those guys. Zombie films like Dawn of the Dead and Lucio Fulci's Zombie were part of my initial education of the horror genra back in 1997. It's a genra that apart from a few hiccups, had been dormant since the mid-80's.2. And this is the kicker: I actually kind of like movies based off of video games. Well, I should change that too: I'll give movies based off of video games a chance. Maybe it's because I grew up in the age of the original Nintendo (and the age of the Atari, now that I think about it, although I was so young then that I had to ask my dad to hook it up everytime I wanted to play it), but I think it's possible to make a video game based movie as long as the film captures the spirit of the game. It's been done before: Both Tomb Raider films are kind of nifty; Mortal Kombat was fun in a Saturday afternoon way; And Resident Evil was OK, I suppose. But it's also been done really poorly: Wing Commander (does anyone even remember that game?); Double Dragon; Street Fighter all come to mind.So, here we are with House of the Dead, an adaptation of the Sega arcade game (I'm guessing it was available on other platforms, but I'm only familer with the ardade version).It was one of those first person games where the player used a lightgun to fire at zombies and such that lurched towards them. It was pretty cool, I suppose. And did a fairly good job of recreating the vibe of a 70's zombie flick. So, I actually thought it made a lot of sense to make a movie based off of it.The Plot: A handful of young adults get a ferry ride to an island where an allnight rave is being held. They arrive only to find the place deserted, except for the legions of zombies being raised by the spirit of a tortured Spanish scientist from the 14th century or something.Thrown into the mix are a crusty sea smuggler, and an undercover police officer.The first twenty minutes or so of this is more bland than it is bad. But when the zombies start popping up, House of the Dead reaches an apex of sorts in what its trying to do. Let's just say that when the protagonists launch their big offensive against the dead, the story gives way to what seems like nearly 25 minutes of uninterrupted bloody action.Bullets fly, heads go exploding, limbs get munched. All to the tune of a heavy metal song that I actually kind of liked. Well, I didn't like it so much as I thought it fit the scene real well. Maybe it's that part of me that grew up in the era of Iron Maiden and Judas Priest, but it's kind of nice to have heavy metal reclassified as \"devil music\" instead of \"I'm mad at my mommy for bringing home a stepdaddy music.\"Yes, it's silly. Yes, the constant screen shots from the video game are a bit much. Yes, like i said, the big battle really does occupy nearly a third of the film's running time. All of these criticisms are valid, I suppose.Still, the movie worked for me. 2003 and 2004 found horror coming back to life in a way. New directors were going back to the past for inspiration, and bringing back new takes on old stories. Eli Roth's \"Cabin Fever\" drew from cyncical portraits of human cruelty like \"Last House on the Left.\" Marcus Nispel's redux of \"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" did the same, only with a nearly apocalyptic visual sense. Heck, even the 2004 take of \"Dawn of the Dead\" showed new audiences a hint of the cerebral horror of George Romero.It's amazing how quickly we lose our perspective on the genra. \"House of the Dead\", as far as im concerned, is the best, heck, the only, attempt at bringing the gritty, sloppy, rotten, zombie experience of Fulci back to life. Something I thought I'd never see playing at my local cineplex.Don't believe me? Well maybe I should give you some perspective. I told myself a long time ago that I wasn't going to complain anymore about \"Scream\" and wave of films passing themselves off as horror through the late 90's, since that genra has pretty much died out now, and that by doing so I was really starting to sound like one of those Fangoria dweebs. But honestly, what would you rather sit through when you go to the movies? \"Valentine\" or \"House of the Dead?\" \"Urban Legends\" or \"House of the Dead?\" \"I know what you did last summer\" or \"House of the Dead?\"Yea, I thought so.",

            "content": "House of the Dead is based on the Sega game of the same name. I have never played the game myself but this movie doesn't do very much in the way of persuading one to give it a chance. The story is as follows. A group sets out to go to a Rave party on an isolated island and in their first but not last act of stupidity during the course of the film they miss the boat that was to take them. They coax a cigar smuggling boat owner to give them a ride to the island by giving him $1000. 500 to get there and 500 to get back. With all that cash floating around, the group should have skipped the Rave and went and brought some brains. Well, they get to the island and to sum the rest of the film up, there is a lot of running around, screaming, breasts jiggling, tired and I do mean tired stereotypes of every character, especially the Asian character. That was just ridiculous. Uwe Boll must think that the Matrix is the greatest movie of all time because he uses the camera tricks from that film all throughout the battle sequences, which mind you dragged on way too long. And if all of that wasn't bad enough, Uwe Boll has spliced actual game-play action into the movie. He seemed to think it added to the film, even if the scenes from the game didn't always match up with the live action. I don't even have to mention awful dialog and acting because I can forgive those nuances. They can almost be so bad they're entertaining, but some things I just can't forgive. How Uwe Boll ever got anyone to support him in this film is beyond my comprehension.3/10 Don't waste your time. I'd recommend it to hardcore B movie fans like myself.

If you're the kind who quotes the \"Romero Bible\", don't go.  Zombies aren't limited by rules, only the limits of your imagination. As corny as you might find that, it may be the best way to enjoy this very flawed movie.  HotD is, at best, a Roger Corman/Sci-Fi channel type of film. Bad cheese, but I've seen worse. Best reason to watch: Jurgen Prochnow and Ellie Cornell.  They have the most dignified characters, the most common sense, and the best lines.  They also have the best death scenes (If you're into that kind of critiquing) Kira, Will and Ona really try, but the script fails them and the other cast members The music wasn't so bad, and the action scenes kicked butt.  I can tolerate the arcade stuff added in.  It's not that annoying if you simply accept this as an Arcade action flick and not a horror film.  I wanted to see the gang kick zombie butt, and I got my money's worth.Worst elements:  The script dialogue.  Ellie and Jurgen get the best lines. Otherwise, there is not an ounce of wit or clever banter. Rudy is the worst Hero since Stephen Dorff's cop from \"Fear Dot Com\" and Jared Leto's Paul from \"Urban Legends\".  Casper and Kirk SHOULD have been the main characters since they at least TRIED to save everybody, while Rudy just stares at his current girlfriend getting ripped to shreds. Sloppy editing.  Stupid teen antics. BIGGEST mistake in the whole film is to have Rudy open the movie with the lines \"If they hadn't come, they'd still be alive\".  This has killed any suspense of seeing who survives in the end! I don't think it's a terrible film, despite my comments.  It's a Cheesy B flick, nothing more.

            "content": "There isn't one horror movie out there that leaves me laughing and shaking in my seat more than House of the Dead had. After watching this last night on DVD, I'm still not sure whether I would give this movie a nod of the head or deface the cover and use the disc as a coaster.To summarise what would be my review for House of the Dead, it would be along the lines of \"cheesy goodness\" as that what it exactly is: oozing with cheese that makes it good.After having played the game in the arcades, I was happy to have seen it on the new release shelf of my Blockbuster. The title alone was enough to have the case stand out; the cover-art was exceptional; \"From Sega's best selling video game\" the blurb cried out to me; I was sold.House of the Dead is very disappointing in the sense that it has absolutely no storyline, no character development, no atmosphere and anything else that would make a horror movie a GOOD, at the least, horror movie. The real downside to this movie is that the ending is shown right at the beginning and it is only the process of their elimination that, I guess..., you'd want to stick around. Another would be the fact that the pace of the movie was ridiculously fast that there's no time to make a connection with the characters, let alone know who's who, and at the same time, know what on earth is going on. There is no sense of \"survival horror\" that one has appreciated in the likeness of the Resident Evil game (or movie), 28 Days Later, Living Dead Trilogy, and such which truly ruined the atmosphere. The ultimately low point of the movie was the middle where the 8 or so \"strong\" group make for the \"House of the Dead\", armed to the teeth with guns tuned in to \"kick ass\" mode, but takes an unnecessarily long time to walk 10-20 meters, even if they were killing the undead in the process. During the course of this action, there were also Matrix-like shots that, I guess because of the quality of the movie, cannot go unappreciated. Yet, there are just so many weakness in the plot, like holding a rave in an island aptly named \"Isla de Muerte\" (or something) and not finding or sensing anything strange when they arrive at the ransacked and abandoned party. If Spiderman happened to have swung past there, he'd be in a coma because of his spider senses going haywire.Through the course of the movie, I desperately searched for the things to justify the movie's state and to why the actors oozed cheese from every hole in their body. I came to the conclusion that perhaps it was because the game characters of the \"House of the Dead\" game had the same cheesy voice acting. I guess they had that point and the shootings of the creatures (which was House of the Dead game-like), as well as the \"death\" scenes similarities down pat. Also, it is good that Sega doesn't go uncredited in the movie and I feel that Uwe Boll, as awkward as he did it, displays this appreciation. However, I guess that by the middle of the movie, you'll realize that this movie cannot be saved from the depths of \"F-movie hell\" that this had descended to.In the end, with more funding, I think this movie could've been in a \"C-movie hell\". Different actors who felt the part and more insight into the story could've drastically changed the atmosphere of this movie. As soon as that black chick drop-kicks a downed zombie, you can't help but just start laughing at the attempts of this movie to be cool. It's so excruciatingly stupid, it's entertainingly good, yet I still find it difficult to say that this movie absolutely sucked or good for a really boring day. Perhaps, it is only for the die-hard fans of the game. On a final note, I do appreciate one character comparing the situation to the Living Dead Trilogy, claiming it to be \"The Holy Trilogy\".",

By relying on the undead as nothing more than monster targets for shotgun blasts, the movie never delves into issues of mindlessness and animal-like behavior explored by better film makers (see: \"Dawn of the Dead\" or \"28 Days/Weeks Later\").ONE GOOD THING: Featuring perennial horror favorites Jurgen Prochnow and Clint Howard; as well as, atrocious dialog and attractive women in revealing situations, the movie is ripe for drinking games and \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\" type commentary.OVERALL GRADE: FBETTER MOVIES LIKE IT: Evil Dead II (1987), Army of Darkness (1992), Dawn of the Dead (1998 & 2004), Braindead (1992), Night of the Living Dead (1968), 28 Days Later (2002), 28 Weeks Later (2007).",

            "content": "On my first chance to watch this infamous movie, I honestly can say that I was not expecting mistakes of this degree in a movie of this budget. It is as if they had given a good budget to a complete amateur. In fact, the entire film-making is completely the opposite to the one Boll displayed in his previous movie \"Hearts of America\" (2003). The only thing that could explain this serious mess is if Boll believes that his target audience is hungry for pointless and dumb scary movies. I hate to say it, but this movie is that: pointless and utterly stupid.Loosely based on the popular video game, the movie tells the story of a group of teenagers who are going to a rave in an island, only to find that in the middle of the party, a group of strange people appeared and killed everyone. They will discover that the strange people who murdered the ravers is not really alive.Even when the plot of the movie has nothing to do with the video game (only the fact that in both appear the Zombies), the basic idea had potential for being an average horror flick; but the script completely ruins every chance it has for being original and interesting by throwing in a series unrealistic situations that serve the only purpose of moving to the action scenes. This leads to a poor development of both the characters and the plot, as if writers Dave Parker and Mark Altaman were more concerned in getting quickly into flashy action sequences, cheap jump scares and pointless nudity.The direction by Uwe Boll does nothing to save the mess this movie is, and even shows a talent to make the already bad written movie even worse. Not only displays a shaky hand-held camera work that makes it look amateurish, the poor edition and the quick cuts make the movie look like a lame MTV video.I must recognize that Boll certainly had good intentions. The infamous use of footage from the video game could had been a well received idea by the fans of the video game, but his overuse of that resource gets tiresome and annoying specially if we consider that the footage has nothing to do with the scenes. Also, the bullet-time effect is well-used in a few occasions, but in the climatic battle for survival it ends up so repetitive that also ends up as a silly attempt for being innovative.The acting is among the worst, not only because of the poor casting of young adults as teenagers; most of the time they look as if they had no idea of what they were supposed to do. Nevertheless, I must say that the few stars I'm giving to this are because of J\u00fcrgen Prochnow's performance. He retains some dignity and his character is the only one that is realistic and well played.Overall, this movie is another good story wasted that will disappoint the fans of the video game. 2/10",

The plot (if it can be called that) consists of some 20-something year olds, who are going to the \"Rave of the century\" on some island. After missing the main boat, they get an old fisherman to give them a ride for $1000. Well, the rave is surely no \"Rave of the century\", it consists of a small stage, some porta potties, and a couple tents. Wow. That's one great rave. A thousand bucks well spent. Anyways, the kids arrive there, find blood splattered all over the rave, nobody there. What do they do? Of course, they go to find all of the partiers, assuming that it was all a big prank. Well, of course they are wrong, and they hole up in a small tomb-like house (that is about 20 times bigger on the inside than it appears from the outside) and fight the zombies to save their lives.I was plain out bored with this movie. The director added a bunch of ridiculous shots from the actual video game the film was inspired by, why? I have no idea, but it looked terrible. The acting was boring and unconvincing, and the writing. Oh, the writing! What kind of person would go look for the \"rave\" after they arrive there and find the place to be splattered with blood. How likely is it that the entire rave wanted to play a big joke like that? This made me automatically hate the characters. And as they died off, we even got this cheesy still-shot of the camera revolving around them, and the screen fading to red. The person died, we get it, you don't have to include this little farewell.Overall, \"House of the Dead\" is boring. It's unoriginal, badly acted, and nothing we haven't seen before.

Reminiscent of \"28 Days Later\" but those weren't really zombies. These re-animated corpses ran, jumped, swam, and even used weapons. What must George Romero, or your average Haitian, think?

            "content": "First of all, let me say that I went into this with low expectations. It's Uwe Boll, whose films I have always avoided due to friends (who generally understand my tastes in film) warning me away. I've seen a good many zombie films, both good and bad -- most bad -- and the art of making a decent one in this day and age seems to be a lost art, even for past masters of the genre.I will start off by saying that the film has its good elements. It moves quickly, there is a great deal of action, and there were also several scenes that were framed so as to be an homage of sorts to the games upon which the film is based. That was nice, since so many game-to-movies seem to forget their origins, which is unfortunate and frustrating.Just as unfortunately, the history of film is littered with poor game-to-film transitions; most of them can't seem to decide whether they want to try and retain the feel of the games, or try to appeal to a broad audience that may not be familiar with them. The first option tends to fail since if it's too faithful, it's like watching someone else (usually someone not very good) play a game that you like to play, but not necessarily watch. The second also tends to fail since it usually alienates the audience who would have supported the film's release and relies on the general audience to pick up the slack...which is unrealistic since the tie-in with the game wouldn't draw them in anyway.This film is somewhere completely different. It tries to be faithful in feel to the games, but it also tries to be something distinctly different. It doesn't really succeed at either, unfortunately.The biggest problem with this film is that it's not sure whether it wants to be a horror movie, a comedy, or an action film. Combinations of genre are generally volatile and tend to be 'like them or hate them' titles. The most vexing aspect of this combination is the way it plays up some of its characters after a point, makes them impressive and more enjoyable, and then casually knocks off 9/10ths of them in underwhelming sequences that simply disappoint. There are some references and quips that attempt to be witty, but most of them fall flat. It's not a funny film, and horror comedy fusions tend to be mostly one with a smattering of the other anyway.The most interesting and likable characters are shuffled off quickly and nonsensically. The script features a lot of incoherency and completely illogical, unreasonable acts that no-one in any circumstances would ever do, simply for the purpose of thinning out the cast. That always annoys me, and this was no exception. The film was exceptionally frustrating due to that aspect, and I found it impossible after a point to care much about it.It also pulled the unforgivable act of needlessly and ridiculously killing off characters too close to the end after already committing to their impressiveness and logical survival, followed by a completely underwhelming ending that elicited more groans than fanboy tingles. Although I was irritated and put off the film by its earlier antics of thinning out the cast needlessly and nonsensically, pulling the same stunts within the last ten minutes is simply inexcusable.The film could probably be enjoyed if you're drunk, watching with friends who like to poke fun at bad films, or simply don't turn your mind on at all during it. A lot of things happen, explosions, silly effects, flashy shots...that's pretty much it. It has a vague, tenuous link to the video game series of its origins, although it does incorporate some clips and some shots of homage in interesting ways. The rest of it is pretty much generic action fodder, however, and it's not really worth the time.The direction is barely adequate, and it's easy to see that some of the actors are more capable than they're being directed to be. It's especially obvious in the cases of well-known actors on the cast, immensely talented and capable as seen in other works, being directed into more stilted, awkward deliveries. It's unfortunate, and I'm sure some of them were treated poorly for having been involved in this film, but it's really not their faults.It's just an unsuccessful attempt to combine several genres, with a greater budget than it knew how to use, unfortunately. If only a wiser crew had been able to tackle it, it might have turned out much better.",

Once our fools arrive, the place is deserted. Zombies attack. Bullets are fired. Quick edits are employed. What little plot there is is forgotten as events move with a notable lack of logic (they hole up in the 'house,' run back to the boat, then run back to the 'house' again?).With a script this awful, one can hardly blame Boll for doing endless slo-mo and 360-degree freeze frames...trouble is, this comes off as the MTV filler it is, and gets old after the first 2 or 3 times. Ditto the intrusive, random screen shots from the actual video game spliced in with the live action. As for the acting, the 'name' performers convey the whole bill-paying nature of the enterprise, while the 'no names' stumble through scenes with pitiable awkwardness (what is with that moron kicking a DOA ghoul?). The zombie makeup ranges from 'not bad' to 'pretty silly,' and the violence is so exaggerated it ventures into camp (though this certainly ain't no \"Dead Alive\"). And the \"Matrix\"-style gunshots are just SO 1999, man...Ultimately, what's strange about \"House of the Dead\" is that it isn't the worst movie I've seen--in fact, the negative word-of-mouth is what drew me to it in the first place. Is it a 'good' movie? No, not by a long shot. But it isn't necessarily rock-bottom awful, either. While Boll is too slick and kinetic with his camera to draw favorable comparisons to the humbler Ed Wood, his films do leave a slimy, ectoplasmic residue that fascinates (in a morbid, 'how-much-worse-can-it-get' way)...Side note: How in the world did George Romero and Tom Savini wind up in the behind-the-scenes featurette? I'm not complaining...though outdated (with Romero pontificating on what would become \"Land of the Dead\"), their presence is certainly the high point of the DVD package (watch/listen for a moment where the line, \"the success of films like 'House of the Dead'\" seems DUBBED IN to Romero's dialog).",

The guy, Rudy, does mention that one of the characters is his ex-girlfriend, and that she enjoys fencing for no reason at all. This is obviously just a set up to give an explanation to why she can sword fight in a future battle scene. Does writing get any worse than this?. The rest of the movie pretty much takes place on the island. A cut to the island shows pre zombie ravers drinking beer, dancing, and doing' the dirty. I think it also goes without saying that there is, of course, shameless random nudity galore.The camera angles are terrible as well. Cut-aways are used almost every minute, and I could've sworn I saw the same shot of running zombies thirteen times. I really think the director had a thing for slow-motion crab shots too. Pretty much every shot in the action sequences featured a character in the middle of the shot while the camera spun around them \"Matrix style\".The music wasn't anything special, as it was mostly mainstream rock music blared throughout every fight scene and underlayed with repetitive gunshots. The picture quality was also sub-par. It varied from Panavision niceness, to grainy, blurry, and over-exposed ugliness.Is there anything good about it all? Well, let's see...it's in focus but even then it might have been enjoyable out of focus so we would not see what was going on.

It occurred to me halfway through this stinker that it was about as much fun as watching a couple of friends play a video game. But minutes later I realized that it wasn't even that much fun. In this case, the player is the director, and his directorial choices stank like baked ass.The writers deserve their share of the credit as well. To say the characters are one dimensional would be generous. My guess is that no one involved in this movie had ever seen a horror movie, let alone could pass as a fan. It has all the hallmarks of pretension one could expect from creators who are slumming in the genre.There is one bright moment early on, when a nubile beauty takes a topless swim. For one teasing moment it seems that we're about to be thrust into a retro horrorsploitation flick, the kind of no holds barred teen hormone catalyzer they used to make before \"Scream\" laid the future foundation for a kinder, gentler, more pc kind of horror flick.But that moment passes quickly, and the mess that follows is a chore to endure. The zombies are as uninteresting as the rest of the cast. (Note to Jurgen: get a new agent! Fast!) The \"kids\" in this movie run the full gamut from underacting to overacting. In their defense, it's probable that the producers and director were following an agenda to target this movie to ten-year-old game fans, so any acting which might have led to actual scares or suspense was probably actively squelched.Clint Howard in Gorton Fisherman drag stands out. As demented and lopsidedly comedic as his character is, at least there's a spark of life in him.The zombies attack. Guns start blazing. The soundtrack kicks in with what can only be tagged \"trance hop.\" Too leaden and simple-minded to be trip hop, it amps up the monotony factor tenfold. When the editor isn't lopping in ill-advised bits of pixelated game action, the director is injecting slow-motion whirly-whirl nuggets which instantly remind the viewer that the Matrix did it first, and did it in a much smarter context.If you're tempted to rent this, pick up \"House of 1000 Corpses\" instead.

The little flashback to explain why the zombies were there was weak, at best, and all of the action sequences made no sense. The only (and I do mean ONLY) part of the movie I enjoyed was when the group was running up to the house and shooting their way through the hordes of zombies (many of them, like all those martial arts films, waiting until one zombie gets shot before attacking) - the Matrix-like filming was pretty cool, except the whole thing only works as a music video. Logically (and I mean horror movie logic), none of it meant any sense. Jurgen Prochnow, an actor of some merit, must have needed the money real bad.

The acting is really no worse than we should expect, Clint Howard & Jurgen Prochnow are fun to watch (Prochnow looks like he's trying to channel Robert Shaw, from \"Jaws\"), and, though the gore might be a little light, it delivers what it promises.

            "content": "House of the Dead is the first of German auteur Uwe Boll's computer game adaptations. The film made money for its investors, pleased Gamers and triggered an inexplicable landslide of contempt from just about everyone else. The level of criticism directed at this film is utterly ridiculous. House of the Dead is not only a good zombie movie but also the most faithful adaptation of a computer game committed to film.The film's storyline is paper thin. A group of annoying college students sail to a remote island for a \"rave\" dance party. Unfortunately, the island is inhabited by zombies and lots of people get munched. That's it. Personally, I have no problem with this bare bones approach to storytelling. Unlike Romero's zombie trilogy, there is no social commentary and the film is definitely not a parable for current societal woes. Uwe Boll has no hidden agenda; Boll's only aim is to entertain and he succeeds with a roller-coaster ride of non-stop action, gratuitous breast nudity and corny one-liners. There is nothing high brow about this film and for that I am thankful.The most surprising aspect of \"House of the Dead\" is how close it stays to its source material: Computer graphics blend into the action scenes, several characters spin to signify death - a trademark of the game, at one stage animated blood drips down the screen, the selection of weapons is almost identical and the techno soundtrack could have been lifted directly from the game. The end result is a film that plays more like a computer game. The pacing is relentless and the live action violence is stylised to the point where it resembles animation. I found the film's mixed media approach highly innovative and distinctive. Obviously, I am in the minority.In addition to its highly unusual visual style, the film's other memorable attribute is the zombie action. I'm not sure how zombie fans could fail to be impressed by the non-stop zombie violence. The make-up and special effects are excellent and the set piece outside the \"house of the dead\" is fantastic. Boll intersperses slow motion with editing that would make John Woo nauseous in order to create a highly original spectacle. The scene where the zombies chase Simon underwater is fun and a nice little nod to Fulci's brilliant \"Zombi 2\". Uwe Boll's direction can be described with a lot of different adjectives but \"boring\" is not one of them. The film has an interesting cast, who admittedly have very little to do apart from run and scream. However, it is always nice to see Juergen Prochnow and Will Sanderson makes another notable appearance in an Uwe Boll production.House of the Dead is one of the better zombie films of the past two decades. I couldn't care less if the film plays like a computer game on steroids. At least House of the Dead has the decency not to bother with the pretence that is has something to say. Some may call it low brow trash - I call it entertainment.",

Uwe Boll's oft-bashed first US feature is not the train wreck many bandwagon-haters proclaim it to be, though it is certainly no master piece.The movie starts out with a flash back monologue that lets the audience know bad things are afoot (like we couldn't already guess that) and then is off and running with some party scenes on a gorgeous island that concludes with a some skinny dipping carnage (is there any other kind). From there the film introduces most of the primary cast as they attempt to reach the \"party of the year\" on the island, only to find instead a zombie wasteland.OK, the story pretty much sucks. Forget about the script taking chances, it barely can keep itself afloat with clique characters and some awful dialogue. Fortunately, genre regulars Jurgen (Seventh Sign) Prochnew, Ellie (Halloween 4) Cornell, Jonathan (Final Destination 2) Cherry, and the ever lovable Clint (oh just pick one) Howard are on hand to add the right amount of knowing winks to make things alright.From the production stand point, things are fairly polished given the uber-low budget. Boll is actually able to scratch out some occasionally nifty visual effects to go along with the gobs of creature gore on hand. The zombies themselves are plentiful and damn near every one gets the ever loving hell blow out of them, much to my delight (why else do people watch these things).It does nothing to advance the zombie sub-genre, nor does it effect a quality story, but the over abundance of zombie carnage ought to keep most horror fans happy.6/10",

            "content": "In three short years, German director Uwe Boll has launched himself from being that nobody who did that school-shooting movie to being the worst director of horror films/video-game adaptations. The man has a reputation. Is it deserved? When I first heard about this film and how bad people said it was, I first had to ask myself: can it really be that bad? When his second game adaptation, \"Alone in the Dark\" tanked and people said the same thing, I gave in and rented that film. I nearly drank myself blind trying to glean some kind of enjoyment out of that film. Now I've finally broken down and rented the film that started it all. I have not played any of the games Boll adapted, so I'm rating a film, not an adaptation.There's a voice over narration at the start of this film, presumably to serve as a cheap way to give the viewer a sense of foreboding. Then we meet a group of young people met at the waterfront, having just missed their boat to \"the party of the century\". They wind up getting a ride from a guy named Captain Kirk (played by Jurgen Prochnow, who is way too good for this movie) and his creepy shipmate Salish (Clint Howard, doing the Clint Howard thing). Howard's character has a creepy stare and warns one of the bare breasted \"babes\" that the island they're heading to is \"eeeeevil\" and gives her a cross to protect herself with (you can tell he means it because he isn't looking at her chest). This is a cheesy highpoint, but the acting all around is less than great.When they reach the island their party is already deserted. Then, of course, the zombies start to show up. Since Uwe Boll is such an auteur he doesn't waste any time by trying to frighten his audience. No sir, nobody bothered to make the zombies all that scary, or all that visible. Most of the attack scenes are under-lit to the extreme and shown from a distance. So, there goes anything for fans of being frightened or fans of gore. Most of the focus with the zombies is our heroes kicking their butts. This is enhanced by lots of array shots, which were so not overused in \"The Matrix\" films that they must be fresh here.Some people die, a couple turn zombie, we find out the horrible truth about the zombies in an ugly sepia-tone flashback. Footage from the video game is thrown into various parts of the film, I guess to remind us that this is a video game movie and not just a regular bad movie. Like I said before, I couldn't care less about the source. After I finished the film I immediately watched it again with commentary just so I could hear the excuses they had for it. The commentary proved far more entertaining, mostly because of the instances where his actors questioned Boll's direction, to his face. Nothing he said did anything to really defend what is truly a horrible movie.The reputation is deserved. The film is visually weak, the characters are practically non-existent (I remember them as Girl in America Flag Outfit, Bimbo, That Guy, Dude Who Mentions Romero, Jurgen Prochnow, Clint Howard), the zombies are like most others zombies except more forgettable, the action is unremarkable, and Boll ultimately shows no flare for the craft or art of film-making.",

I read one review that blasted HOTD and the writer wrote, \"I was hoping to see something like an old Romero or Fulcci flick.\" HOTD is definitely not what you would call a \"great\" movie, but it does succeed in being similar to an old Fulcii style zombie movie.\nThe bottom line critique for HOTD is, if you liked Fulcii's \"ZOMBIE,\" then you should like this movie.  It really surprised me to see a modern movie done in such an authentic 1970's horror style.  The movie even begins with gratuitous shots of HOT naked girls!  The zombie makeup is VERY 1970. Most of the zombies simply have on white make up.  The best zombies in the movie have a dirty brown latex \"skull\" mask. They look pretty good.  Those are my favorite style of zombies.  The dialogue and acting is total \"camp\" style. It is totally laughable.  This of course means that you will either love this movie for its laughable quality, or you will hate it.  I like campy horror movies, so I liked HOTD.  I definitely believe that if HOTD had been released at some point in the 1970's, it would now be a cult classic, not unlike \"LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT\" or \"ZOMBIE\" or \"THE HILLS HAVE EYES\" or dare I say \"EVIL DEAD.\"One characteristic of the movie that definitely departs from the 1970's style is the use of MATRIX style bullet time effects.  It's pretty fun to watch the high tech special effects in the middle of the zombie melet.The big zombie confrontation in the middle of the film is a lot of fun to watch.  This is the part of the movie when our gang is trying to fight their way through a crowd of zombies in the middle of a spooky graveyard to get inside \"THE HOUSE.\"  That scene was a lot of fun to watch, mindless as it was.  It is a battle-royale with zombies exploding and people being torn limb from limb.  The sequence went on much longer than I thought it would! They just keep on fighting and fighting and blood and body parts go flying all over the place.  COOL!This movie is getting slammed in the reviews, and I think that is unfortunate.  The movie feels very much like a low-budget independent horror movie.  So if you like those, you will probably like HOTD.  I think one of the reasons the movie is not well recieved is because people are expecting something more like \"RESIDENT EVIL.\"  If you are going to watch this movie, try not to take it so seriously.  It really reminded me a lot of \"ZOMBIE\" which I enjoyed, and also \"CHILDREN SHOULDN'T PLAY WITH DEAD THINGS.\"  If you are looking for low budget fun and a zombie halocaustic setting, then you will like this movie...as long as you have a sense of humor about what you are watching!A little word to the other IMDB reviewers:  LIGHTEN UP A LITTLE, GUYS!",

Basically college students Simon (Tyron Leitso) and Greg (Will Sanderson) are taking a boat to island for a techno rave party, they meet Alicia (Ona Grauer), Karma (Enuka Okuma) and Cynthia (Sonya Salomaa). Victor Kirk (Das Boot's J\u00fcrgen Prochnow) and his first mate Salish (Clint Howard, Ron's brother) give them a ride on their boat, police officer Jordan Casper (Halloween 4 and 5's Ellie Cornell) tries to stop them from leaving, as Kirk is a smuggler, they leave anyway, and find that the rave is completely deserted. Soon they realise that a swarm of flesh-eating zombies and monsters have risen from the ground, from the air and from the sea, and are on the rampage attacking all that come in their sights. One bite from them means slowly transforming into one of them, and the only way to kill them is a shot to the head, the remaining survivors try to stay alive in an old house they find, i.e. the House of the Dead, with other survivors Rudy (Final Destination 2's Jonathan Cherry), Liberty (Kira Clavell) and Hugh (Michael Eklund) inside. In the end some good guns and high explosives help them to escape, there is a point when they think its all over and one last attack occurs, but a team of agents take care of the rest and the last two living return home. Also starring Immortals' Steve Byers as Matt and Smallville's Erica Durance as Johanna. To be honest there is almost nothing good I can say about terribly trashy movie that was just trying to cash into the same audience as the same time's Dawn of the Dead remake, Shaun of the Dead and Resident Evil, I admit maybe my attention was caught by some of the bloody deaths. But the mix of predictable action, including snippets from the video game during, and a stupid storyline to act as a \"prequel\" to the game made this film nearly unbearable to keep up with and care about, a rather rubbish horror thriller.

You may be creeped out by the graphic gore...but its doubtful you'll find anything scary in the HOUSE OF THE DEAD. Lame acting, half naked teens(maybe twenty-something)and zombies...that's entertainment. Five Seattle friends hire a boat to take them to a nearby island that is the site of a weekend rave. It seems the party has been pooped already and the late arrivals discover how and why...walking dead. Corpses from an island cemetery crash the party and are ready to now eliminate the interlopers. The cast features relative unknowns: Jonathan Cherry, Cynthia Solomaa and Will Sanderson...and some actors you may have noticed before...Jurgen Prochnow, Ellie Cornell and Clint Howard. I admit it is kinda neat watching the zombies explode at the wrong end of some bad ass weapons. Frozen motion camera sequences give you the idea someone did try to make this more than a B minus movie.",

Uwe Boll's movies... just saying it, sort of, you know, bad aftertaste. He seems to largely make movies based on video-games(at what point does \"someone's gotta do it\" become \"... if he's our only option, I can do without it\"?), and, while I can agree that that might not be the easiest kind to make(has there been a truly good one yet? They tend to range between \"watchable\" and... \"not\"), it would seem that Boll's are extraordinarily poor. The plot is... worse than it had to be. The acting is atrocious. The dialog is awful. The editing and cinematography both seem dead-set on turning the \"film\" into a music video, and the action... well, you might as well watch someone play the game(at times, it would be *more* entertaining to do so), better yet, play it yourself. The use of footage from the game, all... *32*?(!) of them... uh, yeah, Uwe? Don't. The music... eh. Language is loose, there is some nudity, and plenty of violence/gore. Attempts are made to recreate some of the recognizable images from the game, with reasonable success, I suppose. I recommend this to... fans of... Uwe...? No, that's not it... people looking for horror...? Hm... well, if you've got *nothing* to do for an hour and a half, if it's on or you've borrowed it(so there's no personal cost to you, money-wise), I guess there are worse things to be doing, if that does make for a terribly short list. 1/10",

When they arrive there, they find no one and meet up with a cop, Jordan Casper (Ellie Cornell- Halloween 4 & 5), and a group of other people who where at the rave when walking dead zombies murdered everyone, turning them into zombies and multiplying there kind. The group fights the zombies with all the weapons they can (mostly guns), and barricade themselves in a house on the island.This movie has mostly ideas that have been recycled over and over again. It uses  Romero's Night of the Living Dead premise, where the gang is locked inside the house with zombies trying to break in. Director Uwe Boll adds in clips of the video game in between shots to remind us of the film's basis, which is pretty dull if you think about it, but it gives it a bit of a unique edge. The acting is mostly horrible, except for Jonathan Cherry (Final Destination 2, They) and Clint Howard, but the rest of the actors are your basic Friday the 13th stupid teenagers who can't act their way out of a paper bag. The movie serves up a lot of gore, so it makes up for some of it's flaws. I hope to see a bit better from Uwe Boll in his upcoming \"Alone In The Dark\" film that is, again based on a video game.All in all, the story is overused and getting dull, the acting is mostly terrible, the dialogue is dumb, but it's still one of those movies you can still like for what it is, despite it's flaws.

This one came on Canadian TV recently, and I have to wonder why the station risked its reputation by showing it. The only reason I can think of is that the movie is a Canadian co-production with Germany, and the TV station may have been desperate to meet its Canadian content quota.I don't know if I can say anything different than any of the other scathing user comments this movie has gotten. Yes, the movie looks as cheap as its $7 million budget. Yes, the movie has a terrible script (someone would spend more than $1000 to get to a pretty underwhelming-looking rave? And several important turns in the plot happen OFFSCREEN.) Yes, the movie cuts in (blurry-looking) clips from the video game for no apparent reason. Yes, the movie is terribly directed (We seldom get a good look at the zombies despite there being dozens of zombies roaming around, and there's simply no feeling of terror coming from the direction or characters.) Yes, this movie is bad, even worse than what you may expect. You'll wonder how someone as incompetent as Boll got his hands on this project, and other projects since. The only possible answer I have to this question is that Germany has some kind of tax shelter plan for film investment that doesn't encourage quality, like what Canada had at one point in the past.",

A number of students who missed being at the rave, party, on the island lead by Alicia, Ona Grauer, get local seaman Captain Kirk, Jurgen Prochnow, together with his first mate hook man Salish (Clint Howard), to take them there for something like $1,000.00 for his services. Right away you know things aren't going well since the captain is hesitant to go to the island because of it reputation for nobody ever coming back from there alive and the hooked-hand Salish is petrified with fear of also going there. There's also the US shore petrol who's attempting to board Kirk's craft looking for contraband. Kirk in fact has a number of creates of Cuban Cigirs which he all but consumed during the course of the movie. Still Captain Kirk and Salish take the happy college students to the island with the US Coast Guard headed by Capt.Casper, Ellie Cornell, following them there. Finding the place deserted the students find their way to this house where they run into the surviving students that were on the island led by Rudy, Jonathan Cherry, who also happens to be Alicia's former boyfriend. Shown a video tape taken by Hugh, Michald Eklund, of the party, or rave, on the island being crashed by the rampaging zombies who killed everyone there. only Hugh Rudy and martial arts expert, which came in handy later in the movie, Liberty, Kira Clarvell, escaped by hiding in the house.The makers of \"House of the Dead\" try to explain whats happening on the island \"The island of the Dead\" by showing us a flashback told by Captain Kirk of this crazed Spanish Padre Castillo, David Paiffy. Castillo was sentenced to death some 300 years ago for, here we go again, trying to create eternal life against the wishes of the church. Being shipped to a Spanish garrison on the Pacific coast he killed the entire crew of the ship St. Cristibol, after he was hung. Castillo then ran the ship aground on the island making himself the islands king as well as turning the natives into zombies. Who then killed anyone who happened to stray off course and on to his kingdom. The movie has the zombies come out of the woods caves and even sea as they attacked Captain Kirk and the students, by the hundreds, all through the night with everyone being killed but Rudy and Alicia. In an underground cave they both run into Castillo, looking his age,with a gang of his zombies who end up being blasted by the trio. Later both Rudy and Alicia have it out with Castillo who loses his head after he runs a spear through Alicia's chest. Wounded and bleeding Alicia kills him by stepping on his disembodied skull crushing it UGH. After the carnage is over the good guys, police secret service CIA and FBI, come to Rudy's and Alicia's \"rescue\" who couldn't have been more happier not to be saved from the zombies but saved from being in this ridicules film any longer then they have to be. There's one thing that really puzzled me about the ending of the movie \"The House of the Dead\" that has to do with Alicia. Being run through with a spear by the crazed Castillo you would have though that she would be dead but it seemed to have no lasting effects on her at all with the wound looking no worse then a mosquito bite. I have the feeling that Alicia is really a cryptic or underground zombie who when she, together with Rudy, gets back to the states will come alive, or dead, attacking the unsuspecting people there. Thus giving director Boll the reason to make a sequel to his movie calling it either \"Lifeless in Seattle\" or \"City of the Dead by the Sea\".",

The script is badly written, the decisions characters make are dumb and the directing decisions are baffling.There are several moments when clips from the video game are used as transitions or to intercut with action scenes. This is incredibly distracting and I'm aware it's an attempt to make it look and feel like a video game but it's a damn movie. Also, when characters die they use this 360-degree rotating shot which is another terrible gimmick.I'll give the movie some credit though, it's so bad it's hilarious. It has lots of shooting action, gore, late nineties electronic music and Matrix-esque bullet time sequences, while simultaneously trying to make it look like a video game.Uwe Boll continued to make other cinematic abominations such as Bloodrayne, Alone in the Dark, In the Name of the King, Far Cry, Postal and Rampage.

Uwe BOll directed it, begins with two minutes of clips from the game, literally gave me a headache and then it showed something that seemed to have absolutely nothing to do with the movie or maybe i wasn't paying attention. THere is a lot of bubbling water for on this island and you start to wonder why there would be a rave party on this island. The film is called \"House of the dead\" and based on some great arcade games, but they appear to only be in the house for about a half hour of the movie and remember those dogs that jump out of the fountain and attack you before you get into the mansion in the games? well, they are nowhere to be seen, nor are the guys running around with chainsaws that look like leatherface, and there isn't a gargoyle like thing anywhere. They could've just called it \"Island of doom\". The film had some \"scary\" scenes before the violence started but then it was all violence with heads being blown up and all that crap. There were girls that used their fists and feet to kill a bunch of zombies, the zombies also died from one bullet to the chest and could jog. The game is about zombie hunters, this is about teens and a coast guard and a crazy fisherman with a crapload of guns all stuck together on an island that is filled with zombies. One of the only things they did right was the \"boss fight\" at the end when they fought the king zombie, the good guys had an axe and he had a sword, not at all like the game but okay. These teens were too good at avoiding zombies and killing them as they had good aim with the guns, could dodge sword attacks and could kill them with their bare hands. In the last fight, the girl is stabbed and falls dramatically then gets up two minutes later as her friend is being strangled by the zombie and then she finishes it off and they live happily ever after. some mindless crap is involved in this movie and the sequel is less violent, but has some suspenseful elements and is actually in the college campus for the whole movie, with the exception of a few scenes building up to it in the beginning, that one had the zombie hunters and none of it was mindless gore. See the sequel and you can skip this one unless your looking for a nice piece of trash to watch on a Saturday night.",

I had not played the game before, though was amazed that director Uwe Boll used original game play footage of first HOTD game to go with the movie and do believe in some of the scenes they actually did work well! For example a scene when three humans are making an escape in an underground tunnel from the zombies, the use of a first person shooter, shooting zombies then straight away jumping to game form of that same moment, I believe did actually work very well for the scene.I give the film a 5/10 and unlike the other reviews I have read of people completely panning the movie. To be honest I did enjoy the movie's use of action scenes, humor and cheesy acting. I do believe maybe the movie could of been better if it was a bit more creepier and shocking in some parts. I did actually jump at one part when some small demon - skull swimming in a mist of red liquid emerged to the screen LOL.Come on seriously, how could you not enjoy that full on 7 minute fight scene in the middle of the movie?! Those spinning 360 degrees cameras around the actors are no longer used in films today! Please just don't look upon the movie and think \"Now that didn't go like that in the game!\" cos believe me, a director does try their hardest to please the fans and I know must be one of the difficultest things to place on screen, including book - movie adaption, and adding new things in the movie which wasn't in the game I believe isn't a so bad idea other wise is too predictable if you already played the game.Anyway I do think anyone could enjoy the full on action and gore the movie has to offer and not just hate the movie of not being exactly true to the game, and of course all zombie films usually have a cheesy b movie story: in this case early 20 year olds being trapped on an island with of course zombies, as they must try and reach the House of the Dead...",

This isn't high brow art, this is dumb enjoyment, and a fun way to kill an hour and a half. You don't need a massive IQ, you just sit down, relax and watch the inevitable dismemberment as a bunch of dumb teens get what's coming to them. OK, so it has plot holes the size of planets, and characters who act with the most frustrating stupidity. So what? The game was a dumb shoot-em-up, why should this be any different? Splicing in clips from the game adds to the computer game feel. So does having death clips where the screen turns red following flashbacks of the characters action. So why discard this policy after the first couple of kills? This is my one major complaint about the film. But apart from this, if you are looking to disengage brain and enjoy a perfectly serviceable horror film then here you go. And in an age where horror films appear to have lost their sense of fun (I'm talking to you Jeepers Creepers and Ginger Snaps) or are verging on the point of ridiculous (Cherry Falls), this film is beyond vital. Other directors, stop acting like we care about the characters! Final point, I watched this and Oceans Twelve today. One was a perfectly enjoyable film.

When you think 'House of the Dead', where do you think it will take place? A house, as you would suppose. WRONG, the film takes place on an island, of course there was a house that was only there for 5-10 minutes, at most. Why would they call it 'House of the Dead' then? Because Uwe Boll has the biggest marketing scam of all time. Choose a popular game title then create a movie from that. The dialogue was very very poorly written. Almost no creativity was put towards the film.There were so many continuity errors it is almost hard to keep track. An example is that weapons that the characters use will switch, sometimes they will even disappear. I don't know maybe the director forgot to give them weapons between cuts I don't want to know either.The acting was so bad. There was very little expressions given in their speech and all responses were clearly faked. But it wasn't the actors' fault entirely. To go along with working for the worst director of all time, this had easily one of the most laughable scripts ever written that wasn't a comedy. The dialogue was just so bad. Here's an example that I'll use when the characters engage in a fight with the villain, who isn't a villain really:Rudy: You did all this to become immortal. Why?Castillo: To live forever! I don't know why these lines are so horrible, maybe it has something to do with Castillo not even answering Rudy's question. All he did was define immortality, I manged to figure that much out on my own. No questions were answered and when something gets revealed that's supposed to shock the audience I was just as confused at the end as I was when trying to piece together similarities between the game and the film. Despite the horrible acting, it is better than the game's acting, but that isn't really saying too much.Have I mentioned the fight scenes? They were just terrible. These people came to a rave on an island, they're just ordinary people like everyone else. But when they begin to engage in a fight all of a sudden the humans become martial arts masters. There was a 10 minute zombie showdown scene that is a perfect display on how not to film a zombie action scene. Nope, I take that back. That isn't how you should film an action scene PERIOD. The guns abilities to shoot are way over-exaggerated and it felt like an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie, minus the awesomeness of course. It's ridiculous what the weapons can do, I appreciate ridiculous but this was just pathetic. As well as the people becoming martial artists, well the zombies do too. If that doesn't say something then nothing does. The movie was just clich\u00e9, WAY too many shots in which the camera would rotate around a specific character. The more the filmmakers used it the more quickly I wanted the scene to end. Deaths are never actually seen on screen, but instead they included clips of the 'House of the Dead' video game or the screen just fades into an eye-burning red, like your closing your eyes while looking into a light. All around the film was almost unbearable to even watch. Plus, using clips is just another example that the movie had no reason to be so different from the game because they had source material to work with.My rating for this abomination: 1/10If you want an accurate representation on how much this film has effected my taste for zombie movies, then I'll tell you. I have only seen one zombie flick since watching House of the Dead. Yes, it's that bad.",

Whoever wrote the asinine script should be permanently banned from Hollywood. I mean, really: WHO WROTE THIS AND WHAT EVER MADE THEM THINK THEY HAD THE ABILITY TO WRITE IN THE FIRST PLACE? My only answer is that it must have been written by a couple of 13 year olds who skipped every English class they ever had. In virtually EVERY scene, I was forced to listen to the characters state (in surprised tones) things that were so totally obvious, I began to wonder if maybe they weren't supposed to be blind. At least that would have explained their need to do this. For example, when the surviving members of the group take shelter in the basement of the house, one character says \"Where the Hell are we?\" and another replies \"We must be in some sort of catacombs beneath the house.\"  Well, THANK YOU for pointing that out as I am just not smart enough to see that for myself. The descent through the floor and down stairs did absolutely NOTHING to help me understand that on my own. I will give the film one positive point: it was visually interesting to watch with some very enthusiastically filmed action scenes (even if they were more than just a little reminiscent of The Matrix). However, even these scenes couldn't save the film as they always tended to drag on for about 10 minutes longer than necessary.I wanted this film to be good and for the first few minutes, you actually think it will be. After that, it falls completely apart. Imagine everything about this movie that could have been bad and you can bet on the fact that it did in fact happenIf you want to see this, wait for it to come to DVD although whether or not this film is worth seing at all is VERY debatable!",

I'm pretty sure my cat could have written a better script. Whoever DID write this used an alias if they knew what wass good for them because they deserve to be banned from Hollywood...forever.

I will give the film one thing: It has some excellent (if blatantly ripped from THe Matrix) fighting scenes but even these are not enough to save the film as they always lasted at least 10 minutes too long.It would have taken nothing more than a few minor changers to vastly increase the overall film. FOr example, the implications made at the end of the film (i'm not going into specifics for those who have yet to see it) were so poorly carried through that I was the only one out of my group of friends to understand it.

It took the general plot, stayed true to the spirit of the source, and yet made it its own living entity--you didn't have to be part of the back-history in order to enjoy the film. I never played \"Resident Evil\" in my life, but I am a rabid fan of the films--I find them intriguing, exciting, enjoyable, and yet I can still watch them with my daughter (if she was into zombie flicks). The movie stands apart from the game, yet gave sufficient nods to it to satisfy most gamers (see comment for said movies) \"Hulk\" and \"House of the Dead\", however, try too hard in the wrong ways to pander to their source bases. Like \"Hulk\"'s many well-intentioned but sorry attempts to actually LOOK like a comic-book, so too \"House of the Dead\" tries way too hard to LOOK like the video game (I don't know how many topless females there are in the game, though). This movie, like \"Hulk\", could have been SO much better, had it taken better notes from its predecessor. Too many what I call \"Matrix-shots\", where they circle around the subject until you're almost dizzy, especially when you're looking up at them, too many clips from the actual video game that make NO sense to the movie plot, and too many lines taken from a dozen other movies that make the actors sound like they're reciting rather than acting. You can almost tell what each person is going to say or do, based on what the others just said or did. Take out the unnecessary nudity and profanity, lose the Gorton's Fisherman and German U-boat characters and replace them with more realistic people you can actually care about, and lose the teen heartthrob stereotypes and give us real people who can really act, and maybe this movie would have had a chance. As it stands now, it deserves the fact that only the Sci-Fi channel would dare try to make a sequel out of it (and this is no compliment to the Sci-Fi channel). Bottom line, wait until it gets to free cable, but personally, I'm glad I didn't rush to the theaters when it came out.",

            "content": "There are two factors working against House of the Dead from the outset. Firstly, it's the back story for the game of the same name, and computer game movies are notoriously awful. Secondly, it's a zombie movie, and, say what you like about Romero's brilliant social commentary, zombie movies are inherently trashy. House of the Dead's zombie infested island is instantly reminiscent of Lucio Fulci's Zombie Flesh Eaters, and when a girl unwisely ventures into the ocean clad in only a thong, an underwater confrontation between a zombie and a shark seems inevitable. Instead, she's merely one in a long line of girls to get gratuitously naked before being eaten alive -- but after all, isn't that what you want in a horror movie? There's nothing clever about House of the Dead, but you wouldn't want there to be. After piles of precious \"thrillers\", it's good to see a horror movie that isn't ashamed to be a horror movie. The plot -- teenagers at a rave on an island get attacked by the living dead -- is pretty straightforward, in spite of the rather convoluted story about Spanish pirates creating the elixir of life, which allows the action to take centre stage. And so it should, because these action scenes are pretty damned impressed. Director Uwe Boll packs a record number of cuts into a very short time frame, which, though not quite the mark of genius he might have been hoping, is certainly a one-of-a-kind achievement. Using hundreds of cameras and special rotating equipment, the film is packed with spinning shots, which evoke exactly the air of a computer game.House of the Dead really revels in the ridiculous; references range from Lord of the Rings to Gone with the Wind; \"Captain Kirk\" commands the Lazarus V; and a starred-and-striped Spandex catsuit clad \"Liberty\" is anything but all-American: and this is the beauty of it. The whole production feels like an elaborate joke between the filmmakers and their audience -- sadly, it's a joke most people don't seem to have appreciated. Lighten up and see House of the Dead for what it is: one of the most entertaining zombie movies of all time.",

            "content": "In reviews of films or television shows I write, I usually try to find at least one good or redeeming thing to say... There has only been one past instance of my inability to do so (simply because there was no redeeming quality in the work I was reviewing), and I thought I would never run into this problem again. Well I have, and in a worse way than I could ever conceive of...The allegedly video-game-based horror/action film \"House of the Dead\", from director Uwe Boll (first sign it is a terrible movie... it is from a director with multiple bottom-100 films, and has (so far) never made a movie that scored above a 5-average on IMDb) is honestly the worst of the worst.The plot revolves around an evil Spanish man named Castillo, who created a blood serum years and years ago (because as we all know, the Spanish had genetic experimentation capabilities hundreds of years ago, or so director Boll would like us to think) that renders him immortal, and turns the deceased into brainless zombies that do his bidding. Or something equally as ludicrous. (Why the zombies immediately serve Castillo like dogs is never explained... because it can't be explained, it makes no sense.) Flash forward to now... A large group of kids are holding the \"rave of the century\" on a remote island (Yeah, sure... makes perfect sense), with no cell-phone reception, no residents, and no way to get help.Of course, it turns out Castillo runs the island and slaughters everyone with the aid of his minions.Then, the \"real heroes\" (I use that term loosely) show up, because they were conveniently late, and arrive on the island with a crazy old captain (named Captain Kirk, who also, conveniently, is an illegal gun runner with enough weapons to start a military coup) that was nice enough to give them a ride.From that point on, the kids realize what is going on; some of the more disposable characters (including several survivors who show up) are killed; and the movie takes off. They arm themselves with Kirk's insane amount of weapons, and rather than leave, decide to stay... why? I couldn't tell you, again it makes no sense.From then on, the movie degenerates into a cruddy shoot-'em-up-fest... And little else...Now, I don't want to ruin the riveting plot line, but I will say I never realized zombies know how to sword-fight and use kung-fu so well! Alright, enough of this merry synopsis, let's get down to the crap...-The worst acting I have seen in some time... Even for a horror film this is bad. Case in point... After seeing one of their best friends get killed, the characters simply stroll off, as though it was no big deal. Then, about five minutes later, one of them says \"Oh, I can't believe so-and-so died...\" and that is it. That is the depth of their emotional abilities as performers... One pathetic, short line and they are over a horrifying ordeal that should be a life-changing event. All I can say is... wow...-Terrible story and writing... I cannot say enough bad things about the script by Mark Altman and Dan Bates. It has the psychological depth of a Twinkie, and enough lame-brained (and very unfunny) one-liners to sink a ship.-Uwe's Direction... What truly sets this film apart from other awful films is the atrocity of the direction. Boll apparently tried to add glee and giddiness whilst directing. You can tell he thought he was making an awesome movie... even though he wasn't. He has the camera zoom, tilt, pan, dolly, fly and spin every opportunity he gets, and he tries to milk the (poorly choreographed) action for all it is worth. But Boll's fatal flaw is that he doesn't understand the concept of pace or being subtle. He simply throws shot after shot at the audience, and it gets boring really quick. He uses \"Matrix\" shots more than the actual \"Matrix\" movie, he constantly does this lame trick where the camera spins around the actors in slow motion, and for some reason, he thought mixing in a bunch of actual video game footage was a great idea. To be blunt, he simply can't direct action...It is really apparent by the time the credits roll that Uwe Boll is without a doubt one of the worst directors of all time. I wouldn't even put him in a room with Ed Wood, as many suggest, because Wood's movies were so bad they became humorous, and that makes them work in a (unintended) sense. Boll's films are so bad, you feel like causing yourself bodily harm to distract yourself from the dim-witted images he tosses at you.Overall, I can say, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that \"House of the Dead\" is the worst movie I have ever seen... Honestly, for your own sake, avoid this at all costs! (Zero out of Ten)",

In the ensuing battle, those worn-out \"Matrix\" rip-off shots were used everywhere: the freeze-frame 360 degree \"virtual reality\" spin around a character, the slow-mo close-ups of bullets approaching their target, the projectile path illustrated in dizzying pans, etc.To my shock and disbelief, some idiot was inserting quick cuts from the actual video-game.

Oh and who loved those character spins??? Who would have thought fencing would come in handy?. Crap. Complete crap. If you want to see this movie because you like seeing 90 minutes of people shooting guns and listen to the most horrible \"rave\" music you have ever heard (seriously it sounds like a 12 year old TRYING to make something on Fruity Loops), rent this. There is literally 10 minutes of nothing but watching each character shooting zombies, oh and who needed that recap of the \"shootout\"?. That acting, superb ;), I've seeing better acting in a porno. There was no gore, zombies look so fake (zombies aren't supposed to be smart enough to chop off your legs and kidnap you), it makes you just want to laugh hysterically and ask yourself why your watching this.

Yeah, our expectations are high, but at least give it your all. This movie adds to the mindset of games' lack of adaptability. Granted he had no $$ for this movie, Boll is still green, and it shows(washes with game footage?). However, if you look at it - and this is going to sound really weird - as a B-movie to sit down and pop a few beers with, this ain't that bad of a movie to watch. At the very least, it can show what NOT to do with a film, or great fodder for a drinking game with your buddies. I'll admit that I own this movie and that I watch it on occasion (makes no sense huh). I guess it's my soft spot for B-movies.

            "content": "I'm not sure how or why, but I just had a craving to watch The House of the Dead one day. I had heard how bad it was, and saw pieces of it, but I just had this bizarre urge to watch it. So I did, and I think Uwe Boll should personally find a way to give me my time back.I cannot even begin to try and decipher the plot and storyline of the film. It really is that bad.Basically, a few young 20-somethings miss the boat to get to an island where the greatest rave of the century is apparently going on. They pay extra to be transported there, only to find no one at the party at all. From here, zombies attack and we find our reason for why no one is around, and why our characters need to stay alive.Simply put, Boll should be barred and banned from Hollywood. If he touches anything in it, his hands should incinerate on contact. This man is a menace, and we need to lock him up or deport him before he continues his streak of cinematic abortions gone wrong (whioch has seen the likes of Alone in the Dark and Bloodrayne since then). This movie is just god awful, and I feel hard set at trying to use words to describe it.There are shots of breasts, for the sake of showing breasts.There is immense blood, shown, for the sake of showing immense blood (forget being true to the source, it's way too overdone here).There is a sense of ridiculousness, for the sake, of being totally ridiculous.This, all added together, makes for one the worst films in the history of Hollywood cinema.I will concede though, I was impressed that the screenwriters found room to explain why there are random guns on the island they enter. Of course, they miss out on the explanation of how our characters know how to use these guns so accurately, and how they know how to fight like they could beat Bruce Lee himself. But then, if they bothered to explain that, they would have to explain how the characters know how to use other weapons like swords, or how they know how to bend gravity and use \"bullet-time\" to their advantage.My brain can only be left at the door for so long before he needs to come back. These screenwriters, and Boll himself, made him find the need to come back and attempt to comprehend how completely ludicrous the entire thing is.Yes, we understand this is a movie based on a video game. We do not need frames from the game spliced into the film to remind us. You also do not need to add the cheesy pan around the characters after they die. It's a classy touch, but an unneeded one. You also do not need to have random memory lapses by characters who are not even in the flashbacks being flashbacked to. You also do not need to steal from every film under the sun (from The Matrix, to Star Trek, to George Romero's ...of the Dead Quadrilogy, and that's just a skim from the top) to try and make this movie anything more than it already is. It screams of lazy screen writing, and bellows of even lazier greenlighting.Even the half-assed \"shock\" ending is just that. Half-assed.I looked for saving grace, and outside of a few humorous lines of dialogue (including one even mentioning Romero's films), I could not find any.It's a terrible film, that just never should have gone past the screenplay. Everyone involved (and thank God most of the actors have only really done Indies) should be ashamed of themselves. Boll should have learned his lesson with this piece of trash, but only time will tell if he will stop making these continued cinematic crimes against humanity.0.5/10.(An extended review also appeared on http://www.geekspeakmagazine.com).",

The rave of the century is being held on a remote island as a group of college friends try to get there before the fun ends. Enter seafaring Captain Kirk who takes them to the cursed island. Once on the island they must fight for their lives as the zombies attempt to take a bite out of them. The script is pretty weak, any thought of detailed characters is exchanged for weak dialogue and the occasional weak in-joke. The direction for the most part is pretty standard with the occasional bout of semi-creativity. They use their version of the Matrix bulletime several times. A couple of those sequences are pretty good but most were merely OK. The use of actual game footage is stupid at best, it never does anything for the film. It doesn't even make you nostalgic for the game. What I would have done is pixalize footage shot for the film. The acting is sub-par. Just enough to move things along.

            "content": "Yet another case of a misnomer title.  `Island of the dead' would've been more appropriate; by law of misnomer titles, take a wild guess as to the quality for the rest of this film.  Still not sure?  Well, I'm not afraid of writing spoilers in this review since the opening voiceover effectively spoils the entire film.  Oh, and so you know - if I leave out any aspect of the production, you can safely assume that I ran out of space/patience before I complained about it.I have to applaud the makers though because while this film is crap--it's cutting edge crap.  Since we've mastered the art of bad horror (by b-film standards no less) and mastered the hideousness of the MTV generation film technique, Uwe Boll takes crap to the next level and combines all the hideous clich\u00e9s of both worlds and even *that's* not enough!  Throughout the film, we frequently cut to the game (which, admittingly, was different and a nice touch . . . for the opening credits.)  Put it all into a blender, and Boll redefines 'hideousness' with a vengeance.  This is avant-garde crap.I also want to point out this film has more cuts in a 30 second sequence than the entire Star Wars saga with room to spare for SW:Episode III (I wish that was an exaggeration.)  Someone needs to be shot for that one.\nI'm curious about monster movies like this - why is it the zombies are never around until after the `heroes' get comfy and someone wanders off or has a sex scene?  Are all these cinematic monsters that effective at setting traps?  I mean, I know the logical thing would be to have zombies wandering all over and that would make it difficult for some poor saps to obliviously stumble across them (much less, plan a frickin' rave on the same island). `Guys, there's 20 dead people walking on the beach staring at us . . . you even think about going there, and I'll kill you all myself.'  Okay, so then we'd have no movie . . . and I fail to see a downside.  At least Paul Anderson's Resident Evil had the decency of explaining why no one encountered zombies or monsters until the midpoint of the film.I also want to know why they even bothered with a plot.  I'm not stupid enough to complain about how pathetic the plot is; I just want to know why they didn't say, `Screw it.  Let's just stick them on the island, forget about explaining anything, and just start shooting action scenes'?  As is the plot is just a flimsy whimsical excuse to get them on the island, but would we lose any b-film factor if we dropped it?  Maybe have the director appear at the start of the film like Hitchcock did for The Wrong Man? `Ladies and gentlemen, I won't lie to you.  This movie has no plot. There's no reason for anything in this movie.  There is no point to it.  It's more or less a 90 minute long music video about killing zombies and Sega product placements.'  Ooh!  Ooh!  I know what they should have done!  They should have muted all the sound, put it all to music, and imitated Marnau!\nAmusing aspects - only in a horror movie will you find some guy stupid enough to pay over $1000 just for transportation to a party.  Most intelligent people have a few billion more important things to invest in.\nOh yes, and you're supposed to believe that it doesn't phase a particular underwear model that he's hopelessly trapped on an island with 3000 zombies nor is he phased when his friends are gruesomely slaughtered right in front of him.  But he gets a booboo on his face and his career will be over, *that* is the end of the world.I have to say I'm disappointed they didn't do the 360 camera move and blood dripping from the top of the screen when all the characters died, but we did get a 360 around each character as they fired their guns.  Why flirt with the concept of overkill when you can make it say `whose your daddy?'\nI also enjoyed the overuse of quick cuts to show zombies running from tree to tree with no sense of geography so they might as well be on another island altogether and not threatening the victims.  Hitchcock has a famous analogy about a bomb under a table referring to suspense; House of the Dead doesn't have a bomb, instead it opted for a water balloon.\nLike I said, avant-garde crap.  And no, the fact the filmmakers set out to make a cheesy film does not excuse them; this is bad by cheesy b-horror standards.",

But dang, it's gonna be tough.**You may be SPOILED by reading this tripe** (possible spoilers)The good shtuff:  The make-up and prosthetic work in this flick kicked butt! Lots and lots of gratuitous blood and guts, and isn't that one of the prerequisites we have to watch horror films? The point is: it was done with at least a modicum of panache, and there was a serious effort to make it look believable.This was a VERY well-acted movie, for the most part. Jonathan Cherry played his role perfectly, and looked like a hunk while doing it. Tyron Leitso did a great job, and combined with the fact that he's pretty dang easy on the peepers, I'm surprised that I haven't seen him in more features. Ona Grauer had the whole 'kitten with a whip' thing down: sexy, smart & strong, and convincing. Clint Howard was cool as the slightly-off-center 1st Mate. He played his character in a very legit way, but there was a sense that he knew this movie was really spoofing other zombie-genre movies. J\u00fcrgen Prochnow did a fantastic job as Captain Kirk, and didn't rest on his laurels--which so many actors with his studio creds do in smaller roles, for smaller films. Ellie Cornell, whom I had never seen before, was the actor that I most liked and believed. Here was a strong woman, whose character didn't rely on cleavage or thigh to get attention. (She also happens to be part owner of Mindfire Entertainment, one of the movie's production companies.)\nBeautiful set--supposed to be taking place in Washington, but I think it might be Canada. The island set was amazing, with lots and lots of greenery, and in the midst of it all, a REALLY CREEPY LOOKING house sitting on a lot peppered with tombstones. I'm not sure how much was filmed on location, but I think the setting alone made up for some of the movie's downfalls.\nGREAT eye candy during the rave--in fact, everybody in this movie is beautiful, except the zombies. But, if you gotta have zombies, better to have these--the kind that REALLY look real. No pancake-make-up-to-the-neck-then-stop stuff. No more crappily applied skull-caps and fake wounds. These lil biters are looking like they really could, and really would.\nThe crud:  First and foremost, a more appropriate title for the film should be \"The Island of the Dead\", not only because one of the movie's central figures mentions twice--not once, but twice--of the story about \"La Isla de Muerto\" (the Island of the Dead), but because only a fraction of the movie takes place in the house, but most of it takes place on the island.I saw this movie with my 13 year old son. He informed me that the idea was taken from a video game of the same name. Throughout the movie, in images are flashed on the screen that are taken from the game. In my opinion, those little distracting shots add nothing to the film, and in fact, break the continuity throughout the entire movie, making it impossible to build and sustain 'scared' or suspensful  feelings. And isn't that the whole point of a 'scary' movie?This script has got to be one of the WORST ever written. In the theater I attended, there were several times when the audience started cracking up at seemingly non-funny parts. I realized quickly that they weren't laughing at the inept acting--it was at the ridiculous lines the actors were spouting. The script did contain funny parts, like characters' names that mimic television characters (ie, McGyver, Capt.Kirk, Casper), but they were few and far between. And the storyline surrounding Castillo was very interesting; I wish they would've have developed that a bit more.This movie contains the usual continuity goofs, but the biggest was when the group gets their first peek at the scary house, and all around the graves there were torches ablaze; but when they further approached the house (about 5 seconds later), all of the torches were out. Nobody mentioned it, nobody noticed it, nobody gave a hoot. And it was pretty rootin-tootin noticeable, too, considering it was shot at night and the main light source was supposed to be coming from the torches.So, I guess, if I had to put a fine point on it, I'd give it:*****  5/10 Yea, it's got some really crappy aspects (script), but the good stuff (Jonathan Cherry, make-up, the acting, set design, Ellie Cornell), balances it back out.\nkeep flickin'! peace!",

But they arrive to find all the partygoers dead. After being attacked by zombies, they arm themselves with Kirk's weapons & take on the zombies in a massive battle.Ever since the mid-1990s, there have been videogames featuring zombies, from \"Resident Evil\" to \"House of the Dead\". While \"Resident Evil\" was an intelligent & frequently scary example of survival horror, \"House of the Dead\" was just mindless FPS action, where the only goal was to kill as many zombies as you can. The zombies in the game are just an excuse to appeal to zombie fans in the same way that \"Resident Evil\" did (& did better). Both games have since been turned into feature films, along with sequels. While the film version of \"Resident Evil\" was a success, even if not an entirely good film, \"House of the Dead\" is a failure on all counts. The script, being written by fans of the game, is extremely poor - why is there a rave party held on a deserted island? The acting is negligible, although Jurgen Prochnow gives an enjoyable performance as the smuggler Captain Kirk (there are a couple of jokes about \"Das Boot\" and \"Star Trek\"). Clint Howard plays the bugged-out sailor in a bad way. While most zombie films are driven for outlandish gore effects, this one is driven for action film poses & is an excuse to showcase some silly 'bullet-time' scenes, as well as display some screenshots from the original game.

No one can act (They rooted through the bottom of the actor bargain bin for this one) and they all run off at alternate points because they probably wanted to be in a better movie (Like Gigli maybe). The cast alternates from being really scared to using karate on the zombies and all gung ho.

The dialog sucks. Let me give you an example of how bad it gets \"Dude, oh man you're sick. Here's a beer to make you feel better.\" \"You wanted to be immortal.

They just thought that blasting zombies would be enough to keep everyone happy. Guess again. The movie is cheesy, clich\u00e9, and just god awful. Its not even funny how bad it is. If you do decide to see it don't say I didn't warn you.",

House of the Dead has the same old boring zombie story, BUT! there is a twist to this movie, it's kinda like the new diet coke with a twist of lemon. It is the same old formula with a new twist. The twist is the fact that the filming techniques were different and enjoyable. The 360 degree shot of the characters and the clips from the video game really gave this movie it's own identity. Plus it had awesome character development for such a short film. The only problem I have with this movie is Ellie Cornell, who played Casper. I mean what happend to her, she was awesome in halloween 4 & 5. Did she forget how to act? But she did look great and I still love her, so in the end I gave House of the Dead 10 out of 10. It was original with excellent charcater development, it moved quickly and had an awesome score!!! Way to go!!",

            "content": "Okay, let me start off by saying that nothing in this will come as a surprise to anyone who's read the other comments.  That being said, MY G-D, THIS MOVIE REEKED!  I mean, WOW, I didn't know it was possible to throw as much money as they obviously did at something and still come out worse than ANY Roger Corman movie!  Corman was probably pitched this movie at some point but declined due to the poor quality of the script!  The only reason this movie got made in the first place is that someone said, 'Hey, Zombies are popular.  Video games are popular.  What game can we get a hold of that has zombies in it?  Resident Evil?  No, someone else got there first. Silent Hill?  No, too silent.  People will never sit in a dark room just to be scared silly.  Hey, didn't Sega have a game where people ran around shooting zombies?  They're out of the platform biz, we could get that for pennies!'Basically they tried their best to make a movie that felt like the video game, even down to shooting the combat as if the characters were actually playing the game.The first and major problem is that the original game was horrid.  I mean,bad-movie-merchandising-made-into-a-worse-game-in-two-weeks-and-then-shippe d-out-and-bought-by-morons-and-their-parents-for-christmas horrid.  The graphics were boring.  The monsters were boring.  The levels were boring.  The interface was boring.  The CASE was boring.  In other words, this was a boring game.  And that was the ARCADE version.  The home version was even worse!  With the home version, you didn't even get the shotgun to hold in your hand while you were being bored silly by this pointless game!  But I digress.The second problem is that they went so far as to actually intercut scenes from actual gameplay during the fight scenes.  HUH???  Didn't the editor have enough confidence in the effects to indicate that there was an actual fight going on?  Not to mention that EVERY fight was shot from the perspective of a video game, which may explain the tedious use of Matrix-style effects.  The problem with this is that the game was a first-person shooter (the player proceeds from the POV of the character). Maybe that's why they put in the game graphics, to let you know that they were alluding to the game...  Right, whatever...Anyway, the only thing that made this ENTIRE experience remotely enjoyable was the fact that everyone in the theatre was making fun of the movie out loud, so my sudden fits of hysterical laughter and general incredulity were taken as commonplace and didn't get me kicked out.To sum up, DON'T GO SEE THIS MOVIE!  Don't even deign to rent it when it comes out on video in a couple of week.  Run.  Just run.",

            "content": "They premiered this on the Sci-Fi Channel last night, it was about like their usual Saturday night movie. Not much worse, not much better. The difference is that this had seven times the budget of their usual pictures.We start with some kids hiring a boat to take them to a rave on an island. Almost every single line of dialogue is a clich\u00e9. Funny parts here include the harbor master who is yelling over a megaphone for the boat to stop - why didn't she just walk the 50 feet to the boat instead of standing there yelling? And the boat's first mate who reminds me of Igor from the movie Young Frankenstein. All he needed was a hunchback. The boat's captain tells him to tie off some lines or something - probably hard for him to do since he's got a hook for a hand.Eventually they get to the island and are attacked by zombies. If you've ever seen a low budget zombie movie, you know everything that happens from now on (Oh wait, the budget for this was 7 million). The ONLY good things are an Asian chick in a skin tight American flag costume and some cleavage from another girl.The incredibly stupid and annoying parts are the camera work. You know that lame effect where they freeze the action, and the camera swings around 360 degrees, showing the character from all sides, and then the action starts again? I counted 17 exampled of that - SEVENTEEN! - in less than 5 minutes. We're talking the camera going all the way around the character at least once, maybe two or three times. Seventeen freakin' times...isn't that just unbelievable? There's also video game footage stuck into the movie at random intervals. If you're five years old, you probably thought that was cool. And of course you get the slow motion bullets flying through the air. Actually that wasn't as annoying as I thought it would be, probably because of all the other idiocy it's surrounded by. And need I even say it? This monstrosity of mental deficiency is, of course, accompanied by blaring rap music. And once it's over, for some reason I can't even begin to fathom, the camera zooms in on one of the character's eyes and...we get the whole stinkin' thing played back again at fast-forward speed. The entire last 10 minutes or so, just zipped past you again in about 20 seconds. I won't even venture a guess.The characters are just what you'd expect in a really low budget movie (oh wait, I have to keep reminding myself this cost 7 million). None of them distinguished themselves in any way. There's the chick in the skin tight outfit, the chick with the cleavage, the rest you can file under \"miscellaneous\". The story, well, no one could possibly care about the story because the whole movie is just about what kind of insanely gimmicky camera effects they can do - over and over and over and over and over.Overall, watching an Ewe Boll movie is like watching a retarded kid pick his nose and then eat his own boogers. It's pitiful in the extreme, yet at the same time, you just can't help but laugh.",

            "content": "Man this was an awful movie, and I'm a big time horror fan.  About the only people I can see this film appealing too are the ones who like to see repeated slaughtering of zombies again and again to the point where it's supposed to be funny I guess.  Usually horror films fall into two genres, the really scary movies intended to freak you out (my personal fav's) or the kind that are lighter, still have gory scenes, but are meant more to be funny and not to be taken seriously.  Well this movie failed both IMO.  It was just down right stupid.  I'm amazed movies like this ever make it past the production companies.The Zombies themselves looked pretty good, but that's not hard to accomplish with today's technology, so no brownie points there.  I'm from Seattle, so I was hoping to get into the plot a bit more being that it takes place in a Washington island chain called the San Juan's, but no luck there.  So it's pretty much reduced to one of those movies where you're hoping for some good T&A scenes as there's not much else to look forward too.  You get a few boob shots and such, but as always the only girl your really interested in seeing without any clothes on is the very one who doesn't take them off, but man o man, what a rack\u0085The other two complaints I have to ramble about were the overused cut scenes to the game, man that was so annoying.  The person who pushed that through should have been castrated the way pigs are.  The other very annoying thing was the overuse of the bullet time camera panning.  This they really could have used to embellish the movie, but instead they did the same 360 camera rotate on every cast member in the same scene as they are unloading on zombies, very repetitive, very uncreative, very boring.  I felt sorry for the zombie creators as they certainly did a fine job of creating zombies and them getting blown away, but it certainly didn't save this movie from being the flop that it is.Don't waist your time, there is always something better to rent than this.

The battle scenes are pretty awesome if not illogical and useless, as well the boss battles seem like they're out of a video game which is good. But that's just it the people making this movie should have realized that this is a game and not a great game at that. Even resident evil made more of a plot and made more sense. I wont even touch on the plot and story line as there is almost none the movie keeps driving along as a rail shooter should.

Yet, a lot of the flaming comes from people who in the first place do not appreciate B-action flicks.So, let's be honest:Pros: Jurgen Prochnow, good photography, okay directing for the action sequences (they are actually cheesy but fun), some cute actresses (Kira Clavel), gratuitous nudity in three separate occasionsCons: Script is awful and characters are not consistent (e.g. the first death witnessed by the protagonists: one girl has turned in a zombie and twists the neck of one of the group of friends before she is shot by a cop: no one even looks at the guy who just died), the cutting and editing sucks and sometimes you don't understand what is happening (e.g. one second a guy is lying on a beach watching is naked girlfriend bathe, then the next second she starts drowning, and the next scene he has fallen asleep -- no sense of continuity)So, it's not all bad, but what makes this movie tough to watch is that THE PRODUCTION DID NOT DO A GOOD JOB AT KEEPING AN EYE ON THE DETAILS. The movie is kinda fun but ruined at times but this lack of professionalism that transpires through the continuity inconsistencies.And don't tell me it's because the budget is low. A movie like \"The hills have eyes\" was extremely low budget but there are no inconsistencies in the unfolding of the story.Funny thing: in the DVD there is a documentary on Zombies in movie-making in which George Romero acknowledges difficulties to finance his own 4th \"Dead\" movie.

It matches and (god forbid) actually betters Mortal kombat Armageddon in terms of so bad its not funny.Put it simply this is the movie that made Uwe Boll despised amongst the gaming community and its not worth seeing the movie for that reason. I have watched this on DVD by the cheap from the public library. It will be returned first thing tomorrow.Simply put the film as every review has stated involves some 20 somethings who miss a boat to a rave at a hard to get Island and decide to fork out $1000 for the trip to AND back. However this isn't the absurd part, the absurd part occurs before that scene where literally 3 minutes into the film we have a character who narrates saying who has survived the ordeal (that we are yet to see)Its the same narrator who repeats the obvious such as when the group miss the boat, he mentions it again to the viewer (in a more dramatic fashion but in a clich\u00e9d sense)If the fast forward button was not invented I would had packed the DVD away at this point, storytelling is dead and we spend 15minutes watching this group pay for the absurd trip, and walk round topless. (Even that isn't much of a selling point)In lazy fashion the film 'reveals' the terrifying secrets of the Island...via a video camera showing the 'rave' disturbed by the undead. I can pick at how well handled the camera is during the filming of supposed massacre but even this old technique that has never been perfected since the Blair witch project adds dread or feels in any way original, and nor does it explain how the zombies can be so clean in their kills. They kill, eat and spill blood on the rave and when the group arrive all they find is one bloody T-short, even then they think its just a prank.Regarding zombies, their full of contradictions. We see them swim, sneak around in the bushes in very fast and swift movement, run and are quite agile acting not quite like zombies. Even for the zombie fan there is no gore, one or two zombies even have no make-up on! It's even more astounding that 'sega' uses old house of the dead shoot em up clips from the game on the basis it acts as a homage or adds something to the movie. The music is awful, sounding out of place and the budget is basically rubber suited maskmen. I dislike Anderson's take on resident evil but it is at least entertain and has some good moments.The acting is terrible with the most boring story they could offer, characters pop out of nowhere without sense, cgi is just a clip from the first house of the dead game (and that is not a compliment) the direction for these characters is non paced and non existent. Even the eye candy dries up very quickly in this film.This is the 'plan 9 from outer space' for video game movies. it really is that bad. How Uwe boll or his friends have jobs in the film industry (or got their qualifications) I do not know but this is truly dire.ONLY watch if you have a fast forward button but even as you fast forward you'll find nothing worth watching.",

I was pleasantly surprised to spend an hour and a half watching a decent film; much better than a lot of big budget stuff, such as some of the Hollywood remakes of some horror classics. So long as you understand the budget background, and find lower budget films entertaining - such as great Brit Flicks like Shawn of the Dead -there's something worth watching here. I'm guessing this was more of a Canadian film than USA, and that seems to show in the whole manner of the film. I've often found that many Canadian movies to have some magic ingredient that makes them stand out, but an ingredient that doesn't taste good to the masses.The effects were appropriate for the low budget background; don't expect the sort of stuff you see in Resident Evil. Apart from too much dialogue to the audience at the beginning, the direction and production quality was good. The acting was appropriate for the roles without being award quality; bimbos were bimbos, tough guys were tough guys, etc. The lead role (J Cherry) was the usual brooding thoughtful hero type.Simple, unchallenging entertainment that doesn't pretend to be something it isn't.

The story has absolutely nothing in common with the game except for the fact that there are zombies. The only reason you know it's a video game adaptation of House of the Dead because they annoyingly use gameplay clips of the games too much. The characters were just stupid and had absolutely no personality even though the movie tries to force-feed their personalities to you at the start of the movie. The acting was just diabolical, I've seen much better acting with kids pulling a sickie to try and get the day off school. The directing is just absolutely dire and the writing is terrible.This is possibly one of the worst zombie movies I have ever seen. Even the action scenes were unappealing and too Matrix-y. I also hated the fact that all of the characters suddenly knew how to fight, every single one of them were pulling off kung-fu moves here, there and everywhere and they suddenly learned how to fire a gun and reload fast and how to use a sword. If you thought the voice-over guy in the trailer was bad, it has nothing on the dialogue. The dialogue, the script and the direction was a total nonsense. The acting was just horrible from start to finish, it felt like a terrible no-budget horror movie that you bought from Poundland. It's just rubbish. It was boring, it didn't bring nothing new or special to the table, it didn't follow the game at all\u0085an utter waste of my time. The most irritating thing about the movie was the fact that it was meant to be a video game adaptation and yet it didn't follow the games at all, not even the characters were named after them. The only way you knew that it was House of the Dead and not something else was the constant, annoying gameplay footage being shown through the game whenever a zombie was nearby or when an action scene was coming up. I really can't see anybody liking this whatsoever. If you like absolutely terrible, cheesy horror movies then you might like this but even then, you might hate it.

The object of the game is to kill zombies, nothing more, and that shows in this movie adaptation. There are even a few shots from the game thrown into the movie to make it even more apparent that this is a bad adaptation.The first half of the movie is really just the build up to the big, game style, zombie battle. It introduces the characters (card board cut outs), and establishes the setting. It is also supposed to have an ominous feel about it, building up anticipation and when the zombies show it it should be scary. This does not work as , it is just so goofy. There are several unmotivated boobie flashes and scenes of unintentional comedy that completely ruin the mood and when the zombies show up they are laughable, not scary.Around the half time mark, the movie just gives up on being scary and goes into complete game mode. It starts off with a scene showing the crew load up on weapons, that would put the loading up scene in Commando to shame. You would not believe the amount of guns they bring. Then we come to the big action scene. There is zombie killing all around, these kids (who don't know anything about guns) are instantly turned into zombie killing badasses. Every single one of them even gets their own \"cool\" Matrix style mid air freeze and spin around camera. It's the funniest thing I've seen in a long time. The movie could have ended there and it would have been fine but after they make it to the house and take refuge, the end just becomes drawn out and slow which kills an otherwise funny (if not good) movie.",

The acting is bad. It's just a mess.Clint Howard tried too hard to be a bizarre character. And Ellie Cornell, who was beleivable in the Halloween sequels, seems to be struggling to remember her lines.Intersplicing video game footage with battles was lame. Having bad music pumping during battles was lame. Having casual chit chat between battles was lame. And c'mon, a Sega rave party on a deserted island!

Most of us look back on Ed Wood as one of the very worst directors who ever stepped behind a camera. Right now, I would have to say that Uwe Boll makes Wood look like Steven Spielberg! Poorly made and totally devoid of logic, good writing, and scares, this was a \"movie\" that never should have seen a theatrical release. How that happened is a mystery that will probably plague me for the rest of my natural life. I cannot begin to speculate how I would have reacted after paying my hard earned money to see this junk in a theater. Renting it free from the video store I used to work at was bad enough, because I still lost 90 minutes of my life that I'm never going to have again! Somebody needs to put Boll in a paper bag and ship him away somewhere! He has no passion for what he does, no common sense, and he very obviously takes the vast majority of us fans out there for fools! To hear him prattle on about this movie in the special features portion of the DVD, you would think he had just filmed the second coming of Christ! He is delusional and clearly needs to seek professional help if he seriously believes this happy-horse-dung was, in any way, entertaining.This had no business being made, bottom line, and is a total slap in the face to anybody--like me--who considers themselves horror fans.

It must have been one hell of a tax write off for them.The narration was so muffled and I couldn't tell who was who in conversation.The opening interaction when these party goers negotiate with the fishermen to ferry them across the river was so poorly acted it wasn't even remotely comedic. Was it trying to be funny? Well it failed there. I immediately lost interest in this and the action hasn't even started.If you have any taste in movies, then avoid this one.

There is no story at all. No characters. You don't get to no much about these people. Who is the one main character this bad excuse for a movie is all about? I have no idea. You don't relate to them in any way. There is a voice over by a guy. The one guy you no less about. The one man you get to no most about is really the captain and he has nothing to do with it! It's not a good written story. The dialog is just silly and stupid.Then there is the total lack of logic. The characters act total illogical in certain situation, and the situations them selves are weird as well. For instance, a bunch of rich teenagers that have never seen a fight and much less fired a weapon, suddenly becomes martial art masters and state of the art marksmen... The actors does a less good job and as for the directing... Uwe Boll does a great job in making this a horrible movie. Using clips from the computer game as transitions and short clips of monsters running in the forest. It's a nice try, but sorry it doesn't work! The music in it self is not so bad, but it just doesn't fit this movie and it contradicts the rest of the mood in the film. Not that there is much mood and atmosphere, though. It is not scary or tense or anything in any way. You don't get any feelings.One thing I did kind of like was the lightning. This was at times good and there was a couple of nice shots, but over all the cinematography was nothing out of the ordinary. The special effects was also among the better things in this movie. It was, however, nothing extraordinary.Now, why should you see this film? Well, you shouldn't. I mean it! This is one of those movies you just don't need to watch no matter how bored you are. The only excuse to watch it is if you are a die hard horror or video game made into film fan. Then you might consider it.",

Ladies and gentlemen, I was wrong.I won't begin to describe the plot because the amount of stupidity in the layout makes me want to vomit. Basically, it's a mindless zombie flick that had a budget that could barely buy 2 Big Gulps at 7/11. Mindless violence, rubber zombies, split-second shots of the actual video game (??!!?!?!) take the helm and give us a gore fest starred by some of the worst actors ever caught on celluloid. The film hit rock bottom at the 15 minute (yes, 15 minutes) shootout scene, complete with Matrix-style 360* sequences. At the point where the Asian in the American flag jumpsuit dodges an axe in slow motion \"Neo\" style thrown by a zombie and blows it's head off with an AK-47, I could actually feel my brain turn to mush. Why? C'mon guys! There is no way anyone - ANYONE - could actually sit down and map this nonsense out. It's just too insulting for words. But alas, the ridiculous scenes, and insulting nonsense poured on screen continue and then the \"off\" button on your DVD player, much like a bullet to the head, begins to look mighty friendly.If you're curious, I really don't recommend it.

The movie has EXCELLENT special effects that, I personally think, just raise the bar for movies just to high. I really love the idea of using the video game screens to change between scenes, and I really love the idea of instead of using the stupid \"air wave\" idea for slo-mo bullets, the director (Uwe Boll) uses water and it makes for a great and fun movie for everyone to enjoy. Many people say that there is no plot, but you have to play the videogame first! Rudy, who is the last to survive invents the zombies in the first video game and that is what its about, the beginning of the zombies which are supposed to be stopped on December, 18, 1998 (In the video game).

No. Was it the worst piece of film I have ever seen? No. Was it OK? Yes. Did I enjoy it? Yes. Yes I did, as a horror movie did I enjoy it? Kinda. It has zombies, and tons of gore and excessive violence, and of course some enjoyable nudity... all things that make my kind of movie. Uwe Boll take's a hard bash off the fans and critics, but in reality, this movie isn't near as bad as people say it is, the dialog is just OK, but the characters you just want to see die, especially the Simon character. Ona Grauer's Alicia character is the only one you really feel for at all because she is so damn hot, not to mention, she's not really all that stupid. She's one of the best parts of the movie, if not my favorite part. The zombies are, OK, but nothing special like in Dawn of the Dead '04, but still looked OK... But it is clear to me that Uwe Boll is a good director who accepts not so great scripts... but, he could have cut out all the clips from the game, that was just irritating, and yes, Uwe, there is such a thing as too much action, especially in a horror movie, but without all the killing of the zombies, this movie would have been a total loss.Now, in closing, as a horror movie, this probably deserves to be in the bottom 100, and as an adaptation from a great game like House of the Dead, it for damn sure deserves to be in the bottom 100 but in reality, this is a pretty good B-movie to spend 90 minutes of your life on. Hell, I'll be honest with you, I cant get enough of this damn show! I am highly anticipating the sequel, cause I really found it entertaining and fun. Pick it up if you can get it from $5 or so. With this movie you can do two things, 1. be a cynical critic and slam this movie forever, or 2. enjoy this movie for the funny, gory film that it is.

Yay, how inventive. The undead you see are visually worse made than the undead in the Night, Dawn, Day trilogy - and I do expect better FX from a movie made in 2003. The characters are horribly made, hollow and unbelievable. We have a pre-med who, surprisingly, seems to instantly understand and work with the work of a mad scientist - the latter having spent several hundred years working on it. We of course have the classic party-girls who, without further ado, knows how to use various weapons - shotguns, pistols and automatic rifles. And of course they know how to hit with 'em as well. To take things even further, the last surviving chick just happens to be a fencer so she can duel the evil boss in the end. How quaint.The actors, however little they had to work with, doesn't do much to make the characters alive either. Many of the lines seem stiff and read-up rather than actually spoken from a role.Visually, the movie has a few highlights - the battle outside the house does have a few nice FX, but in general it seems somebody has been confused. It mixes a lot between low-budget, advanced Matrix-copied CGI and, in the worst cases, screen shots from the computer game.For me, the most annoying part of the movie wasn't the bad acting, the bad story or the lack of gore. It was the endless clips from the computer game. I don't rent a movie to watch a computer game.Nah - if you want zombie action, get the Romero trilogy, the remake of Dawn, Braindead or, well, every other zombie flick made. This one is rock bottom.

Had House of the Dead been consistently ridiculous throughout its screen time AND clever, it might have become a classic (Goodness knows, it has 'cult' written all over it). I find it interesting that one of the major comments from another reviewer was that it had \"acceptable T&A action\" (or words to that effect). Hmmm. A teenxploitation flic that refers to, variously, Jaws, The Matrix, The Island of Dr Moreau, Night of the Living Dead, Romero per se, The Hunger (work that one out - you know there's more that one), coitus interruptus via zombification, and \"let's go look in the run-down shack in the middle of the graveyard\" movies. Oh, and one of the lamest lines ever: \"Haven't you SEEN Scoobie Doo?\". Well... yeah, the audience has. And there's the rub. When you get a movie that is shamelessly based on a first-person shooter game, and a director who constantly reminds you of such with bites (pun intended) spliced into the action and, on top of that, attempts to give it cred with those references, well... exploitation just fell into the abyss (and it is most certainly NOT looking back).It could have been great, it could have been sooo bad it was a hoot. It falls somewhere in the middle: an unremarkable film containing teens who, faced with an unpopulated 'rave', either elect for the unattended booze, or go looking for the reason for that unattended keg.Maybe I'm just getting old. Maybe the notion of a bunch of teens suddenly becoming weapons and martial-arts experts in a matter of minutes is too much for me. Maybe it's just a crap movie.",

            "content": "SPOILER ALERT-Based on a good video game that had good art and graphics, this movie managed to disappoint me on almost every level.  The opening credits start with footage taken from the game with a \"find edges\" filter so that it is an almost indistinguishable, psychedelic mess.  It would have been more interesting to have shown unadulterated footage from the game to show off some of the great art to people who aren't familiar with the games. Instead they do this in half-second clips inbetween scenes in the movie which is both cheesy and distracting.  Or I could say it's stupid and unbelievably annoying but it really is all of these things.  The bad acting we could put up with in zombie movies but the bad editing only accentuates the bad acting. Now, if this movie was supposed to take place on an island off of Florida, it looked more like Alaska.  Young adults in their mid-twenties are going to a Sega-sponsored rave on the mysterious Island of Death out in the middle of nowhere.  Does Sega really sponser raves on islands in the middle of nowhere?  If so, you'd be way better off to skip this movie and go to the rave instead.  The wealthy youngsters arrive 15 minutes late and so they pay a weirdo and his rather menacing captain a thousand dollars for a boat ride to this rave party.  They argue over this instead of finding someone else to take them.  This is supposed to be a bay in Florida, I guess boats were very hard to find there.  The captain whose name is Kirk turns out to be one of the most enjoyable characters in this unenjoyable show.  They give him a few hundred more dollars to run away from the Coast Guard.  Now once they make it to the island, they find bloody clothes at the rave and no one else is around.  This doesn't strike them as too odd so they quickly split up to explore and become zombie bait.  Apparently, people have been disappearing by the dozens over the years on the island of death but this has never been investigated by the authorities.  Captain Kirk temporarily saves the day by having a hidden arsenal on his boat.  Now, the editing in the fight scenes with the zombies is atrocious and includes lots of multiple angle spin-arounds and slow motion with poorly made-up zombies which aren't frightening in the least.  By this point I wanted to leave but since my family was watching another movie, I was stuck in this golden turkey to the bitter, boring end.  There is an interesting lab where zombies are made but it is far too late in the film to add much interest.  It's like spitting off the Titanic to keep it from sinking so fast.  I love zombie movies but this sucked and it gives an already questionable genre a worse name.  I give it a generous 3/10.",

Well there you go folks, it pretty much ruins the already predictable ending.My main concern is that the Director (and I use that term extremely loosely) has gone on to direct another video game to movie; Alone in the Dark, which was in and out of theaters faster than pushing the restart button on your Playstation. But what a surprise, he is still allowed to direct after these two travesty's he still has 2 more video game to movies in production! Bloodrayne and FarCry, both games I enjoy, and i was quite excited when i read what stars are to be in Bloodrayne, but when I found out that Uwe Boll is directing it, I felt nothing but pity for the actors.There is a reason that movies based on video games are never that good... 1. because the directors (such as Uwe Boll and Paul Anderson) are allowed to make them! 2.

I feel it could have been a lot better but was not a total waste of time. Over all, the movie is a lot better then Alone in the Dark and a fun way to kill time.",

The dialouge is so bad, that every line is humorous, the special effects are so bad they make you giggle, and the video game scene transitions, they are funny every time, surprisingly enough, they never get old. The actors are so bad they make this movie even more enjoyable, including Ron Howard's retarded brother. There is absolutely no continuity in this movie what-so-ever, which is also humorous. There is one fight scene, in which they have to fight their way into a mysterious and/or creepy looking castle thing, and even though it is only a short walk it takes them about ten minutes to fight their way there, they kill countless zombies, and yet when there is a wide shot, there are relatively no bodies on the ground. Another humorous thing is to watch some of the special features, it is funny because everyone in the movie is actually taking it seriously, I was shocked. Not to mention that the blonde actress isn't really an actress at all, because she is exactly the same as her retarded on screen counter-part. Uwe Bol will certainly do down in history as the worst director of all time, which is good news for Ed Wood, incidentally. The cinematography is so cheesy and stupid, it looks like something a seven year old concocted, and the music, dear sweet Jesus god, don't even get me started on how great the music was. It was so bad, that it added to the humor of the movie. I love this movie. It is one of the funniest movies ever made, and I would highly recommend it, if you watch it, you will not be disappointed.Amazingly Yours, Dr. Stone",

            "content": "But it's not as bad as I've heard some people make it out. Some people claim that the entire film, from start to finish, is one big turd. That's not quite so. There are some nice shots and... well, J\u00fcrgen Prochnow is in it. But that's it.Apparently, there is a large rave on a big island in the middle of nowhere and a group of teens want to get to it. So they pay a strange fisherman (Prochnow) to get them there. When they arrive, they realize (well, at least one of them does) that something is out of place. That's right, something is out of place. The entire rave is empty, yet only one of the characters seem bothered by this.Soon they are attacked by zombies and team up with other people to survive this hellish night. Or something like that.Why did I watch this film? Because I wanted some zombie action. I wanted to see some people be bitten, scream and turn into zombies. To bad the zombies in this film are nothing like ordinary zombies. Forget anything you think you know about zombies. These guys are not tough. They're pushovers. Shoot them anywhere, and they go down. Also, they're fast. And they fight, with weapons and karate moves! As a matter of fact, these zombies are like ordinary humans except that they don't talk. It could have been any action movie out there, but just replaced the bad guys wardrobe with lots of rotting flesh.The dialog is some of the worst I've ever heard. It's so ridiculous, and when coming out of these actor's mouths I can't help but to smile. It's really stupid, and laughable. But the problem with this film is that it's very dull. It's no \"Plan 9 from Outer Space\" where you can sit back and enjoy the lack of brains. It's just dull. The plot, the characters, the monsters. Everything! There's a lot of strange things going on as well. For example, there's a ten minute long action scene with people just shooting zombies in \"cool\" ways. Sure, could have worked for a minute or two. But for TEN MINUTES?! You'll be tempted to fast forward through that, trust me. Especially since it's very stupid. A bunch of rave teens suddenly turn into Neo, Trinity and Morpheus and karate kick, bullet-time jump and blast their way through hordes of zombies. And I mean, hordes! There must have been at least a hundred zombies or so killed in that sequence alone, if not more! Between scenes, there's shots from the game. It makes no sense, but they are there. Suddenly, computer graphics (from the game) pop up on the screen and you wonder what the hell is going on. Don't worry, it's just a scene transition.One of the most boring films I've ever seen, and even so there's always something happening. That's when you know there's something wrong. But in all fairness, I HAVE seen worse films. There are a couple of stylished shots that look cool and since you walk in with low expectations you probably won't be that disappointed.I give it a three. It's bad, it's not worth watching, but I've seen worse.",

Who knows just were this movie went wrong, but it sure did. QUICK! Maybe it was the rap song that was playing in the movie. The story is very stupid, involving very stupid kids who have a rave on an island(?) The dumb story almost gets to you until you see the full effect that the acting will have on you. I was beyond belief at how bad the acting really was. No words can really describe. The special effects are a joke, and are used all over the place. I think they were spending more time on the crappy special effects and not enough on the story.The script is -- well -- a big Joke! It feels like it was written by a little kid. It shows all over the place.We get nudity that comes out and nowhere and has no purpose. The directors explanation for why it is there in the DVD commentary is lame. he says something like you need to have nudity in a zombie movie for it to work. What!? there is one point were a girl is standing around with her top off, and just holds a conversation with someone while she's topless. The scene is pointless and has nothing to do with the lame plot. I was at least expecting it to payoff in the end somehow.....But no! Don't expect to see any of these actors in anything else in the near future. or the director for that matter. Please skip this trash of a zombie movie. Pick something better like Night of the living dead, Dawn of the dead, or 28 days later. I would even say that Resident Evil is better then this movie.

Or simply shooting the smuggler captain from the beginning?  Where did this bunch of weakling coeds suddenly acquire sharpshooting skills and martial arts?).  The acting is beyond bottom of the barrel -- your local high-school drama department could come up with more emotional delivery of lines.  Even the visuals, which should be the saving grace of this movie, manage to leech all possible tension or energy from each shot (we keep seeing dozens of zombies carefully 'sneaking' behind our heroes, for instance...why aren't they gnawing on their vitals?)There are children starving in the world, and these useless people decided that it would be better to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on this movie instead...and then had the gall to send it into theatres.

If all you want is a video game, complete with what look like straight-from-the-computer cutaway sequences for action the film was too cheap to actually make special effects for, this is it. My friend and I actually had a great time seeing it, since the theatre was mostly empty and we could heckle a bit. This movie REALLY requires heckling.Plot? There was a plot? OK, some stupid college or later types get invited to \"the rave of the year\" and go to one of the San Juan Islands (\"If they'd only stayed back in Seattle, they would have survived.\" - direct quote, or nearly.) to attend. They get there and everyone is gone, and the site is somewhat wrecked (but hey, the keg is still full!). With the help of a crusty old captain and a coast guard woman (who acted only slightly less tough - and slightly less well - than Cynthia Rothrock), they fight lots of zombies (some which spit acid), get an earful of freaky legends, and mostly get killed. That's about it.It's not quite as BAD as Demonicus, but not by much, and still better than Severed (they are sort of my own personal alpha and omega for bad movies - the former is bad but fun to heckle, and the latter is just too freaking bad to watch more than once). On the other hand, if you're expecting a video game movie as excellent as Resident Evil, run away!!! run away now!!!OK, some real big questions (without too many spoilers): Since when did Spanish ships of the 18th century venture into the Pacific Northwest????? Why is anyone in the Pacific Northwest smuggling guns, and to whom - CANADA, for crying out loud??? Why is a rave on an unnamed (oh, excuse me, it's called \"isla del muerto\", shya, right) San Juan Island - and outdoors, still keeping in mind this is THE PACIFIC NORTHWET. And the rave has about 30 people in attendance - \"the rave of the year,\" my patoot.Lucky thing there's lots of hatchets around. Lots of them. Everyone has them. Must be a hatchet sales outlet nearby.Finally, while the movie started out playing with a little \"parody\" (with nudges at I Know What You Did and Jaws), it didn't carry it through near enough.OK, really finally - when the introductory comments (in a voice-over, no less) casually mention that one of the characters \"gave up her boyfriend to focus on her fencing\" you can be darn sure there'll be some fencing by the end of the movie. Not GOOD fencing, but a couple of people hacking at each other with swords, anyway.",

It revolves around a group of college students going to a raver on an island and expect good times, but find nothing more than the dead coming to life and attacking them left and right. It seems that these creatures attack for no known reason. While the effects are quite the thing to behold, it seems clear that the rest of the film is not the best...even of the worst.

Especially when thrown.All weapons have a nearly limitless supply of ammo, and are automatically reloaded when holstered for any amount of time.The optimal throwing distance for a hand grenade is 2 feet.

They miss the boat and they hire another boat \"very easily\" to take them out to the island and drop them off. The only thing good about this movie, it has the immortal Clint Howard as the \"Igor\" of the boat. He is the one that searingly knows whats on the island and warns the stupid kids not to go. They don't listen so you know what happens next. I don't want to go any further bc i get a headache just thinking about this waste of time. The funniest thing about this movie, and this will be all, is that the college age students get confronted by the zombies and of course they have to fight, so they get weapons and they seem to automatically know what to do, like they are Navy SEALs or something.

However, I do demand at least one or two characters that I have some passing interest in, and at least a few thrills. This film delivers nothing. Surprisingly, I thought it started well. Technically, the film is fine. The locations were nice, and photography was pretty good. Some of the actors weren't bad either. (I don't know whether this would be considered slumming by Clint Howard, but Jurgen Prochnow has certainly seen better days.) Unfortunately the film was ultimately undone by the lackluster script and its general attitude. Based as it was on a video game, director Uwe Boll gives us characters and situations on the level of a video game. Case in point is the endless battle when the survivors fight their way through a horde of poorly-made up zombies to take refuge in the house. This battle seems to go on forever, yet there was no suspense or sense of jeopardy. Any thrills from the gore are diminished as a result of overuse. To make matters worse, if that was possible, they periodically cut away to footage from the video game! That totally ruins any remaining illusion of reality. This is a bad movie.

There are some flaws, sometimes serious, sometimes minor, which can lend themselves to keeping this film from being spectacular.The film is in essence a prequel to everyone favourite shoot-em-up game, helping to set the stage for why the evil doctor we all know became interested with death and life, and how he might have gotten interested in this very phenomena. The film itself begins, rather confusingly, with one of our protagonists, the one who matters the most. He is on the island of death, about to be joined by a few more colorful teens.The teens are on their way to attend a massive rave, which is perhaps not as massive as we would like, but for $7 million total budget, I'm quite happy Uwe Boll didn't spend too much money or time on making this rave look like something stupendous. Besides, how often haven't we heard something be called 'party of the millennium' because it got 2 kegs instead of 1. I digress. The teens arrive on the deserted island courtesy of the ever-impressive Jurgen Prochnow, dressed as though he stepped off Das Boot a few years later, yet again a very clever stroke by Uwe Boll. Some lame jokes about being called Captain Kirk is cleared up by the wielding of a very large knife. Kirk and his side-kick and comical rip-off, Clint Howard, agree to take the teens out to the rave, and of course gets drawn into the madness. They get a few scenes to get used to the island, and then the story kicks off.This is where Boll has either stumbled across something brilliant, or perhaps missed the note from Romero about what zombies should be like. However it is where he hits the Game square on the head. The action sequences begin, and continue as you see effectively hundreds of cool-looking zombies dispatched by an array of firearms. Inbetween cool shooting scenes you get to find a bit more back-story to the island and a bit more character development, though admittedly I care about them no more than I cared about most of the NOES kids or the F13 Jason-fodder. Still, I appreciate the token effort. It also builds into the climactic fight-scene, a massive FX-laden shoot-out. Boll has discovered a new toy here, and he uses it to good effect, though he could've done without repeating it too often. Still, it shows Jurgen Prochnow blowing away a good array of nasty creatures. For those of us who loved the game, you have to love seeing zombies being blown away left right and center as they try to approach for that deadly bite. I loved this scene, it pretty much ratified the whole film for me.From here we would move into the resolution of the film, where we manage to tie together the back-story, game-plot, and the plot itself into a singular finale.So why is this film being lauded as the worst film ever? I have no idea. If you look at horror films and some action films from cinematic history, this is well-acted by the main characters, has a lot of action, a lot of time put into its zombies and blood, and has some funky shots in it. Are there flaws? Absolutely. I'm not a fan of the soundtrack, some of the sound is poorly balanced, and there could've been a few more scenes in the end, but overall, this is a perfectly watchable film.Sadly, most people won't give it a shot because of the great fun that is 'Uwe Boll hatred' on the internet. It's silly and childish, and if you want to be taken seriously, watch this film and form your own opinions, don't just feed off a poorly made hate-campaign against a perfectly competent film-maker.",

They try to hide in the house and fight off zombies\u0085 \nCOMMENTS         I wasn't expecting something spectacular from this movie. I knew that its based on a video game that I personally played and liked it. But something was telling me that this movie won't be good. And I was right. This movie is like a towel made of several pieces. Pieces from Matrix, Evil Dead , 28 Days Later\u0085.and so on.          Acting is poor but somehow is saved by performances of Jurgen Prochnov and Clint Howard. Though Howard didn't get much screen time. That's bad.  Other actors were playing ok. Again all that `teen' stuff. And how come everyone suddenly became great fighters and learned how to use guns ? Of course Ona Grauer looked really cute but I guess it wasn't enough to save the acting category. So called `zombie' make-up is very bad. Dead don't even look like zombies. In the main fighting scene near the house some `zombies' just have white paint on their faces. They don't look like real zombies , they're moving faster than living , and are pretty smart too. There is some gore , but it looks so fake that I got frustrated while watching it. Only a few good gore moments , nothing else.          Plot in my opinion is very short and is not developed completely. The survivors spend only 10 mins or so in that house and this is called `House of The Dead'. When they go downstairs and find that laboratory, they also find out what makes the dead rise and  behave like living. Its Blood ! As soon as blood gets on a deadman he immediately stands up , just like a normal human ! This is so stupid. And we don't really get into this story about how it all started long time ago. And those flashbacks from the Video game\u0085what is this all about ? What are those doing there ? Anyway , the plot is just awful.           There are some really cheap elements completely taken from The Matrix. And that really spoils the main fighting scene of the movie.         Though this flick has some good action , and great music. Personally I loved the music in this movie. Imagine its Crystal Method mixed with Matrix Soundtracks\u0085.. OVERALLI was sorry that I spend my money on this movie. It's a baaaad zombie movie. I wouldn't recommend it even to die hard zombie fans. Though if you like Matrix , silly so called `zombies' from 28 days later and some suspense like Evil Dead , you may give it a try\u0085But don't expect anything good. And one more thing\u0085check out this movie's rating on IMDB\u0085and see for yourself if its worth your money.",

(snap)What the hell was that? Wowwie! I'm amazed. I had no idea that human excrement could be rented at Blockbuster. Little did I know you could put it in a DVD player. This film is so crappy, I could almost hear Uwe Bowel grunting, popping blood vessels and fart-splattering in a little plastic outhouse in Vancouver, directly onto the lens of the camera. I had to keep leaving the room. Really. I couldn't stay there watching it. It hurt too much. It's like watching a whino vomit on his shoes just for fun. I now understand the concept of Chinese water torture. I think I lost a few 7th grade English classes there. I can't even write an intelligent review anymore. This film is called \"House of the Dead\", but there's no house in it. Right off the bat, it's false advertising. hehe... It even suggests that this is supposed to be a movie that you pay to see.What's with the spinning camera? It serves no purpose but to make it look like there's a reason for this to be shot on celluloid instead of an old VHS camera found at the local Goodwill.I especially loved the zombie-on-a-stick that pops up like a whack-a-mole, to have a firecracker go off in its head as if it were getting shot by the girl who jumps up to fire for no apparent reason other than to look pretentiously cool.I know horror films are usually bad, and most bad horror flicks go directly to video. How the %#@$! did this end up on big screens across the USA?!?!? Is there a new market for diarrhea on celluloid? It's gotta be this whole \"video game movie\" trend. The producer obviously got a drippy erection when he heard that he could make a movie based on a semi-popular video game for a low budget. I'm sure they spent a fortune on Clint Howard's lousy cameos. Poor Clint.The saddest part about this is the director is STILL GETTING WORK, and I can't find Rod Serling standing around smoking a pipe talking to a camera anywhere! Believe me, I've looked. Who's pipe is Uwe Bowel cleaning to be this lucky? Nice film...for me to poop on! 1/10",

            "content": "OK, first off let me state two things before I start the review.2 - I am a huge zombie movie fan, I love all the Romero films, including the Dawn (04) remake. I have seen many zombie films in my lifetime, many of them brilliant, others not so. 2 - I have seen many awful film; Hercules in New York, Garfield, Alone In The Dark and Baby Genius are to name but a few.When having mates round my house for a \"movie marathon\" night (usually about 6 films in a row),we usually go for 1 film that we know is going to be awfully crap. So on New Year's Eve, 2005. We rented Uwe Boll's \"House Of The Dead\", knowing full well what critic's have said, knowing full well where it is placed in IMDb's worst all time films. Yet, we watched, and why? for the comic value. We rent bad films to laugh at them. If you think you're going to be able to watch a bad film and take it seriously, or mad. However, watch it with the intention of laughing at it (especially with a few mates) and your guaranteed a good time.This was not the case with this film. It went straight passed \"so bad its funny\" straight to the disastrous \"so bad its annoying\". Uwe Boll has tried to make the film adaptation of the classic arcade shooter \"House Of The Dead\", which, any director would try and do with care. Look at \"Mortal Kombat\" and \"Doom\", the directors and writers clearly know the story (or lack of) of the games, and turned it into a film, knowing what it is the audience wants to sees (be it fighting or monster demons.)Yet with this monstrosity, Boll has taken the franchise with the pure knowledge that the ENTIRE of his film will consist of \"zombies being shot\"...and that's what he delivers. But even that simple concept is badly done. The zombies are extremely badly designed and created and is laughable when they're seen swimming, jumping (especially off clearly visible jump pads), running and swinging / throwing axes. Almost as bad is the characterisation. OK, so we can clearly expect that there's going to be almost none of it, given it's a little horror film. But let me ask you a few questions:1 - Would you pay \u00a31000 to go to ONE rave? 2 - Once realising the rave has been interrupted and the people have disappeared, would you stay, drink and attempt to have sex? 3 - If you were a simple teenager / young adult, and you've seen the chaos of your friends being killed by zombies - would you have the mental and physical strength to pick up serious hardware, and go all \"matrix\" on zombies?If you answered \"no\" to all of those questions, then you can carry on reading. If you answered \"yes\" to any of them and wasn't joking, shame on you.This film has no reason to be this bad. Given that Uwe Boll (suposedly) had a decent budget and had one 1st class actor (jurgen prochnow - sorry about spelling)he should have been able to create a good film. The only way that he puts in references to the arcade game, is through very quick 1 second shots of the game itself, with zombies being shot or monsters attacking the screen. This, instead of being thoughtfully placed or helping the film progress, just makes it all the more annoying and adds to the temptation to pressing the \"off\" button on the DVD player.This film cannot be stated as a \"one off bad film\" from the director, he has followed on to make \"Alone In The Dark\" and \"Bloodrayne\", both of them under the score of 3.0 on this website. It's sad to see his later plans are good ideas, because its hard to stray from the truth that he will utterly screw them up.Resist this film at all cost, it does not deserve your money.Resist EVERY Uwe Boll film at all cost, he does not deserve your money.",

Since it's rating was also low, I thought that people were voting 1 or 2 because they hate the director, not cause the movie is bad. But I guess BloodRayne is the exception cause this movie is very, very bad. And I don't mean bad as in \"it's so bad, that it's actually good\". I mean it's just bad, nothing good about it.Let's start from the beginning, who in the world would pay a thousand bucks to attend some party on an island? I know Simon's character was dumb, but that's too much. Then the fisherman told them that they call it Isle del Muertos. I'm no expert in Spanish but I'm pretty sure that means Island of the Dead, but the movie is called House of the Dead, right? When they arrive on the island, they see that everything was upside down. Do they leave? No. Like a bunch of idiots, they stay there for no reason whatsoever. Then, three of these kids go looking for the party while two of them stay at the party site. These three find a house with another three people there. Then they go look for their other two friends. After a couple of deaths, some unnecessary conversations and the discovery that zombies spit out acid, they find the fisherman. Co-incidentally, he has a box full of guns. The stupid kids take them and head back for the house. All of a sudden, they become professionals with these weapons. No one misses any shots and their fighting ability was awesome considering that they were boozed teenagers looking for a party. That scene takes forever and becomes one of the most boring parts of the movie.The house looked like a single, small room from the outside, but weirdly, when they went in, it was actually a palace with lots of rooms and a lot of floors in it. Over there they found a lab. In it, there was a box of zombie blood. When the blood touched the zombies, they woke up immediately. If that's not stupid, I don't know what is. After that, they went underground and there they found the mastermind that created the zombies, who, although being a zombie like the others, could talk and acted like a normal human (you'll never get to know how in the world he managed to create zombies though).They manage to kill him. It was the dumbest death in all the movie. I mean, how can you crush someones skull by simply stepping on it? When he dies, no zombies were to be seen, even though, before, there was a huge amount of them, roaming the island. The movie ends there. Zombies were magically gone just because their creator died and then, the rescue team comes and saves the remaining kids.That's the story. It's kind of a Wrong Turn/Resident Evil plot but about 50 times worse than them. To make it even worse, there is some footage from the game every 5 minutes or so. Pretty darn stupid, isn't it? Just, stay away from this movie. If you rent it, you'll find yourself in the position like these teens were in; you'll wish you can get out alive (or at the very least, awake)",

No one can prove to me otherwise that Uwe Boll is talented in any degree: whether it's a video game 'adaptation' or not. I choose not to see any of his movies. Am I missing out? Nah, not really. I can make my own using an extremely light budget of Windows XP Movie Maker, some mp3s, and poorly drawn animation - and get at least a 6 or a 7 on IMDb for trying.What amazes me the most though about this, is that when you look at this movie - a lot of people have also called the Super Mario Bros. and Street Fighter movie to be very bad. But here is the thing: they stayed closer to the actual material than this movie ever did - and I've played House of the Dead at the arcades to know that this movie has nothing to do with the game at all. The only thing kept from the game are the zombies. This makes me wonder now, A) Why are people going to Uwe Boll to direct versions of their video games on film? Hasn't the poor performance pretty much proved enough? and B) Why waste time with Uwe Boll? Instead of walking in to get a George A. Romero-inspired masterpiece, we get the stereotypical zombie blaxploitation films of the 70's and 80's - where quality didn't matter, and people didn't take the genre seriously. Or at least - making a good game into a good movie very seriously.Personally, next to SMB and the SF movie, I kindly enjoyed Tomb Raider, and only the first Resident Evil movie. RE1 may have been far from the plot, but at least it went down with dignity. This movie... like anything by Uwe Boll, should be banished from all eternity. Maybe Uwe Boll with it too.",

I've watched a fair few zombie films in my time and 'House Of The Dead', like most of Boll's films is not that bad.Fairly standard Zombie film. 'Heros' get introduced, find themselves away from help, surrounded by zombies, fighting for survival and trying to escape.OK, as horror films go, it's not up there with Day of the Dead or Aliens, but is certainly better than most of the low budget 'classics' that so many seem to venerate.The action sequences are very well done. Lots of shooting, movement, well timed.The insertion of the video game sequences is done about as well as it good be. Each game sequence appears to be placed alongside a analogous film sequence (eg zombie with axe). But its an early version of the game so the graphics are poor and detract from the generally good action sequence its placed alongside.The low budget shows in a couple of scenes, such as the initial 'rave' scene with few party goers in sight, but otherwise quality is good. There are also some incongruous 'set piece' moments such as when the Captain character opens his 'hidden box of guns' and everyone takes their pick - complete with cheesy dialogue along the lines of \"A desert eagle, I like your way of thinking, lady\" - but I find that sort of stuff endearing.Characters are quite likable too.Overall a 7 (which, to me, means i'll watch this film a couple of times).",

            "content": "I remember seeing \"House of the Dead\" during its initial theatrical run because I had been following the movie's production for quite a while before hand - and it seemed to be very promising.  On top of that, I'm a HUGE fan of the games, and that was the main incentive for me to look into it in the first place.The film in and of itself is a travesty; a jumble of gore, sex, and haphazard character development.  Some scenes happen for no reason, other scenes go on much longer than they should, and the overall narrative suffers because of it.  An example of the Oscar-worthy script:RUDY: \"You created it all so you could be immortal.  WHY?\"CASTILLO: \"...To live forever.\"A big problem \"House of the Dead\" suffers from is an identity crisis.  Is it a horror movie?  Is it an action movie?  Is it a love story?  Is it a tragedy?  Is it a comedy?  We may never know.Acting is a mixed bag, too.  Some of the cast are likable, namely \"Captain Kirk\" who gets all of the one-liners (not to mention the most memorable scenes/kills).  The majority of the actors/actresses are just incapable of, well, acting.  Sure, this is a B-movie based on a videogame... but are decent characters too much to ask for?The centerpiece of the movie, a giant battle between the survivors and a small army of zombies, is a novel idea - which is for the most part carried out well.  There are only a few things working against it; namely the EXTREME OVERUSE of the 360-degree camera spin.  A lot of the time they use it for no reason, and in a way it hurts the action more than it helps. And, when the 7 minute sequence is over, they show it AGAIN in fast-forward for about 10 seconds.  Why?  Well, I guess they realize how short the typical viewer's attention span is.All of the complaints aside, it's time to address the GOOD points of the movie.  First of all, the zombies.  Clearly this is what the most time, money, and care was spent on.  Their designs are amazing - some of the best in any zombie movie.  Secondly, the effects and look of the film.  A lot of the gore, guns, sets and makeup show semi-quality production value. Third, the soundtrack.  While it's generally oppressive techno/metal/rap, it definitely suits the movie's overall feel well, and often helps to elevate what's happening onscreen.  And, while it's kind of a cheap selling point - the women are very easy on the eyes; namely \"Alicia\".After watching the DVD and listening to producer Mark A. Altman's commentary (who happens to be a big fan of the games as well), I felt kind of bad for him because he originally had a LOT of good ideas that were cut from the movie or never even filmed due to budget/time constraints, or director Uwe Boll just not wanting to use them.  Had Altman's ideas been carried over, \"House of the Dead\" could have been FAR better than it ended up.That said, if you haven't seen this movie yet, you should already know what to expect by now.

Except more like a genius if it was a dog genius with glasses and a graduation hat.  I'm so excited to see that after directing a flop like this (that was even hated by special classes across America) he is lined up to direct a 3 more video game adaptations.

Yes, you heard me right \u0096 they actually worked in footage from the video game as the scene transitions in some useless attempt to do something \"artistic\" when the truly correct and humane thing to do would have been to abandon the entire misbegotten and brainless project at the bottom of the deepest garbage can they could find. It's just another group of incredibly stupid and obnoxious teenagers who then transform into even more stupid and obnoxious martial arts/firearms masters who shoot endless streams of bullets and engage in truly ridiculous Matrix\"-type fight scenes that go on FOREVER.

I saw this movie and I wish I could make Uwe Boll give me my time and money back! For the first half of the movie it's 30 year olds with no acting ability playing teenagers going to a rave in a remote island. And they all have sex, get high, and zombie kill them off screen. In the second half the survivors get guns and every scene is in slow motion and they show a 360-camera pan as soon a shot is fired. It starts ripping off the Matrix for the rest of the movie. They threw in some decent gore too late in the movie. Somehow despite the gore (very late in the movie) and the nudity it was a boring movie that is painful to watch. Al least Ed Wood's films were fun to make fun of. But this is no laughing matter.

In almost every other goal, it falls short. The movie tries for an Evil Dead style camp, but isn't clever enough or witty enough.  The funniest moments are unintentional (check out Mr. Howard's first scene as the grizzled seaman. Classic.)

They're about zombies killing people, preferably in the most gruesome way possible.

Some of the lines in \"House of the dead\" were to low for me and I have a sense of humor. I have seen most of the low budget horror movies since the 70s and not all of them are good, but this is worse than all the other movies together. How ever, Jurgen is still Jurgen, but I felt that what on earth was he thinking doing this movie? I read the user comment before seeing this movie and was surprised to see how right the guy was for once. According to the user comment, you would see people running through the woods, flashes of zombies and running people again. This is the typical \"Friday the 13th\" style and in the early 80s this was actually scary to me. Today it is not! Actually this is so so bad. It is a 90 min movie and it took me several hours to finish seeing it because it was so bad. I felt like someone was trying to rip my brains out from my head from all the flashes. There is nothing more annoying than bad filmed movies and this was one of them. I needed 10 breaks or so in between the bad flashes of people running around like they were not even scared. I don't think it's all to hard playing scared, but I was obviously very wrong. To all horror movie fans out there. This movie is only worth seeing for 1 reason and that is a line from the bimbo that was really funny and a line from Jurgen. The rest of the movie is a pain to watch in my opinion so do yourself a favor and don't watch \"House of the dead\"! There are a lot more exciting ways to spend a Friday night for sure.

'House of the Dead' was one of those. Could it be as bad as it was painted? In a word? Yes!Stupidities abound from the word go. The whole film is told in flashback by one character. The only problem is, he isn't actually present for about the first third of the story! (Maybe it's an homage to Jaws 4, in which another character flashes back to scenes that she never witnessed...) We eventually meet him at the world's tiniest rave (there are maybe 20 or 30 people there, milling back and forth in a failed attempt to make the crowd look bigger). The incredibly unlikeable 'teen' 'heroes', when they arrive, don't have the slightest concern that the rave is deserted and that there are blood-stained clothes on the ground, but instead decide to have sex. At this point, armies of zombies leap from trampolines and it turns into an Evil Dead 2 wannabe, only without the humour. Or the wit. Or the excitement. Or the inventiveness. Or... well, anything good.The only interesting part of the film is the huge shootout sequence in the graveyard, which is so ridiculously over-the-top in its sheer wrong-headedness that it becomes almost entertaining. Gratuitous bullet-time, spinning cameras, thousands of rounds of ammo, exploding zombies, CGI bullets flying through the air in slo-mo...

The CGI was crap, and the majority of zombies were awful costumes which weren't scary, not that i usually complain when it comes to female nudity scenes but these were unnecessary and if it didn't have them or the swearing this movie could be shown on regular TV 2 o'clock in the afternoon.I'm not even going to get into how bad the acting was as it hurts to think that people with no talent in any area of acting who shouldn't even be aloud to get on a Halifax advert can star in a movie.The characters were stupid, they were going to a island for the party of the century which consisted of about five tents and a stage, when they got there the place was trashed and deserted and so their first thought was to go deeper into the big dark forest to try and find them.Actors were dumb, director was dumb, writers were dumb and whoever green lighted and funded this movie must have the brains of a rocking horse.This movie was a waste of time to watch, i would much rather have gone Fox shooting with my dad then spend \u00a31.00 on this terrible excuse for a movie.If you feel you have to watch a zombie movie watch Resident Evil or a George A Remaro flick, avoid this at all costs.I give this 0 out of 10",

OK i admit that it is a bit boring during the first 35 mins and it doesn't really follow the house of the dead story but after the first 35 mins that film becomes a gory zombie film. it is awesome! the action was very good. this is a good film i don't understand what is so bad about it. so the story is about a group of people who go to some island for a party which they pay \"a grand\" (even though this is an American based film and i don't believe Americans say \"ill pay a grand\"(if I'm wrong i apologize)). when they get to the island everyone has disappeared and a bunch of zombies appear out of nowhere and start to kill them. about 50 mins into the film there is a HUUUUUGE action scene which is a montage of zombies getting killed. the gore was awesome and the song was awesome (and that is coming from a guy who normally listens to screamo!) OK i do admit the acting is sometimes a bit plastic and silly and there is some unnecessary nudity in there but this is a decent film that is worth a rent just for the action scene. this is a 15 in the UK and an R in the us because there is gore, swearing and nudity so it isn't recommended for kids but if you want a good zombie film then check this out.",

            "content": "House of the Dead, directed by the world's worst director Uwe Boll, was constantly being told to have been made based on Sega's hit game. Well . . . that is a dirty lie! This movie is a disgrace to nearly everything that calls itself a motion picture.Let me get this off my back. The plot has nothing to do with the game in any way, except for the fact that there's zombies in it. Here is the story: A group of friends are dying to go to a rave that is on an island whose name is Spanish for \"death\". Why people are having a party on a island named \"death\" is beyond me. With the help of the movie's ONLY good character, a smuggler named Captain Kirk (the stupid Star Trek joke is in the movie), the teens are able to get to this great rave, but realize that something is terribly wrong. Everyone is gone and the whole rave site is abandoned. Instead of searching for their missing friends, the teens hang out and start to have the time of their lives. Then, suddenly, after leaving one of the teenage girls (the stupid, horny blond girl) alone in a tent, she comes back, but snaps the neck of one of some survivors they discovered. That is where the plot tries to bring in the horror part of the movie. Soon, the teens, along with a cop who is missing her partner and good old' Kirk, are fighting for their lives against a horde of flesh-hungry zombies.The movie has the worst acting I have ever seen, save Kirk. An example of this is right after an action-filled scene where the team ends up dragging Kirk into a house with a zombie chewing on his leg. Of course, they put a bullet in its head and kill it. After that part, you can clearly see the actor for the zombie actually SHIFTING into a more comfortable laying position by placing his arm on his stomach, all of this is done while the camera is rolling and while Boll didn't cut this scene out is probably because he is the biggest idiot on the face of the Earth. It's really that bad.You have the clique teenagers. You have the dumb blond, the dumber pimp, the smart guy, the girl who has a crush on the smart guy, the crazy Asian girl who pulls off martial art moves on zombies in a certain part of the movie, and the hero and heroine. The cop is only there because the team needs some extra gunpowder and Kirk is there, because Uwe was expecting him to be just another casualty, but ends up being the only reason you watch the movie.You may be saying \"But there has to be some kind of way that the movie is attached to the game.\" This is only answered by 2-second long, graphically rendered clips from the first game that are put into some of the more action-filled portions of the movie. Other than those, the movie has nothing to do with the game.The only reason I continue to watch this piece of trash is because it is fun to sit with my friends and laugh at how bad it is. The only time we were actually really interested was during a scene where the team must shoot their way through a horde of zombies to reach a small house, which was a poor attempt to tie the movie with the title \"House of the Dead\", when everyone knows that the 'house' is suppose to be a HUGE mansion where the first game takes place. This shooting scene is fun, because you see the unrealism of seeing teenagers turning into gun-wielding soldiers. The smart guy? He's duel wielding automatic pistols. The black girl with the crush? Sporting a shotgun. The Asian girl has her fun with stereotypes by kicking zombie butt with martial art moves.In the end, House of the Dead is a complete waste. Keep it in your collection for size purposes, or for those days where you want to watch a really crappy horror movie with your friends so you can all have a cheerful laugh about how poorly directed and how poorly the movie did overall. House of the Dead tried to be the game, but only ended up becoming an abomination of the famous shooting-zombie-face franchise.",

            "content": "This is the most poorly made movie that I can remember being in theaters. Yes, this movie is bad. However, it is not unwatchable. Let's count this movies strengths (which would be weaknesses for most movies, but when you fall into the so-bad-it's-still-bad-but kinda-funny territory, you take what you can get), and come to a better understanding of the film.First off, I love the film's concept of a rave. It's a few tents, a (singular) keg of beer, and dancing in the daylight. Oh, and it's outside on an unpopulated island (because those exist near the United States). I don't know where they got the power to run this rave, since the island clearly is deserted and does not have a power source. Maybe they used power generators...and hid them...and muffled the sound. You would think that a movie like this would exploit the idea of a rave to have pointless nudity and partying, but they don't. We don't even have the gratification of seeing these ravers die, for the most part. All we get is a flimsy framing device for the movie that is quickly forgotten.The movie also opens with narration from the main hero. However, he is narrating things that he could not possibly know about. And then the narration stops. Sure, why not? Now, on to horror movie staples. The nudity in this movie is strange. I think it's a given that horror movies like this need nudity, but even I laughed at one of the two nude scenes. It involves a girl washing her shirt in a sink. Huh? There was a scene involving two ravers making out in the jungle that did not have nudity, but a dirty shirt has it? I'm not complaining, I'm just saying that it's odd. The other nude scene involves a girl getting undressed and swimming while her boyfriend opts to sleep on the beach. During this entire scene, it is clear that there is something scary in the water with this girl. Bubbles are rising up, she's getting scared, and the camera has almost point-of-view shots looking at the girl from underwater. However, there is nothing in the water, apparently. Despite all that foreshadowing, it turns out that the bad guys were in the jungle.There are also tons, and I mean TONS, of continuity errors in this film. The same scene will change from raining to not raining, depending on the camera shot. Characters just emerging from the water are often dry. Sometimes, characters have backpacks and weapons appear on their persons out of thin air. I think the door to the house (yes, of the dead) was even blown up twice.My favorite part of the movie is not even in the film. On the DVD insert, each of the main characters (the ones who survive the initial purging of ravers) is given a military title and weapon of choice. For instance, the Asian woman is a martial arts master. However, the character Simon, who is constantly shown to be a total moron, is identified as the tactical leader of the group. Good choice, guys.And who can forget the video game clips? The clips in the movie rarely have anything to do with what's happening on screen, and on those rare occasions where the video clips and the scene coincide, I would bet money that it was coincidence. Most of the clips are not even played by a real person. Instead, the screen has \"press start to play\" or \"insert coins\" or something like that flashing in the corner. The filmmakers did not even buy the video game they were taking clips of! Another interesting part of the movie is the logic of becoming zombie. Instead of becoming a zombie when you are bitten, like in most zombie movies, you must be injected with a serum. I think you have to be alive for this to work, but I may be mistaken. I would double check, but that would require watching this movie sober. Now, I know this isn't exactly a classic zombie movie, and I do appreciate when movies make up their own rules for classic movie monsters. However, this whole serum business is ridiculous. That means that all of the ravers (remember, there are no bodies found at the rave or anywhere else) were killed and then dragged to the secret lair of the serum doctor, who injected them and turned them into zombies. Apparently, the doctor had been preparing for an unprecedented rave on his deserted island and had made an extra large vat of serum to inject dozens of people with.All in all, there is a lot to laugh at in this movie (I didn't even talk about the Matrix-style shots), but I wouldn't recommend it without a few friends and beer. Or, watch it on a Nyquil buzz when you're sick and falling asleep on the couch. That might be the best way to watch House of the Dead.",

But the fact that the director was going for \"scare\" instead of \"hilarious laughter\" in regards to the audience reaction he tried to invoke, it seems sorta sad when you watch the actors attempt to muddle through a plot less and reason lacking story. You can see it in their eyes, they know the film they are in is utter garbage, but they can't help it. This was done by the now infamous Uwe Boll, who has quickly become the anti-Christ of directors. Which reminds me, if any of you want more punishment, go rent BloodRayne, his latest crap-fest. A good sign of how awful a film fails with regards to the audience is not just when you start looking around the theatre, finding the strangers in near darkness munching on popcorn more entertaining than what you paid to see(sometimes called people watching), oh no. It's when you start \"people watching\" and realize that everyone in the theatre is now staring at you or someone else already, instead of the screen- their eyes desperately seeking out anything that might be slightly stimulating after failing to find anything of the sort coming from the projection room. Folks, skip this. The only way it's enjoyable is in a \"Plan 9\" movie type of way, so bad it's good. If you simply must see this waste of celluloid, then grab some pizza, a lot of beer and invite some friends over to play a drinking game.

However, now that I've read a page of reviews at the IMDb and have discovered how so many have absolutely trashed this film, I'm going to go easier. Who can resist fighting for the underdog?Some of the reviewers were being unfair by attacking elements that don't focus on the real problems of this film, such as the acting and effects. No actor gave a poor performance in this film (featuring poorly-written roles that gave nobody an opportunity to shine), and the effects were very impressive. As the DVD extras revealed, the producer hired an effects team in Montreal, and given the enormous number of required effects, this small house did a very good job. No doubt the budget was limited. The non-make-up FX were also very satisfactory. The photography was A-Plus.The fact that the zombies did not follow movie convention should not have bothered too many; fast-moving zombies who use intelligence is ground that has already been covered. The film deserves credit for featuring a range of zombies in various states of deterioration.But here's the rub: for all the wonderful talent that went into this film, how could they have gone so pitifully wrong? Okay, the \"Night of the Living Dead\" plot of people holed up and being relentlessly attacked is nothing new... but it's always an irresistible platform for drama and chills.The problems: Geeky exec. producer Mark A. Altman is not a writer, and has few clues about \"real people interaction.\" As a result, we don't care about the characters. The German director is very talented, but as Altman mentioned in the DVD, the director went off on his own egoistical tangent to do an action movie. Unfortunately, anyone renting a film with this title is expecting a horror movie. When there is no horror, that's an invitation to major disappointment.All we have is the empty rat-a-tat-tat type of \"music video\" film pacing that is becoming really boring... without any substance to back up the goings-on. And nobody needed the intercutting with the video game to remind us we are watching an empty video game that only runs on adrenaline. What we're watching is a film. By skipping the basics, the film has no integrity.Luckily, some of the DVD extras provided the emotional commitment the film lacked. There was a fun featurette starring four of the female leads as they went through \"zombie-shoot training.\" Interestingly, the pretty blonde who becomes zombie chow at the beginning of the film was chosen as one of the trainees.... even though she never had the opportunity to go blasting. Yet, the black woman who kicks much dead people-ass has been omitted.A parting gripe: how did these plastic and pretty party-goers become so expert in the use of weaponry and martial arts, anyway?But to end on a positive note: the in-joke of one of the pretty people referring to J\u00fcrgen \"DAS BOOT\" Prochnow as a U-boat commander happened to be a teeny-weeny highlight.",

The characters were unbelievably stupid, yet somehow became experts at weaponry and warfare once guns were placed in their hands. Somehow, magically I presume, the humans managed to fight off hundreds of zombies with just a few clips of ammo. The zombies werent scary as most of them had better complexions than the average 15 year old boy. The plot had no substantiation or development, things just kind of happened randomly, the battle sequences were boring, and the end was unexciting and anticlimactic. Hell, the nudity could have even been better. This movie will be out on video very very soon. And God help us if they make any sequels. In Summary: Smelly pile of steaming vomit.

I guess you look for the gang of quietly sticky zombies accidentally some poor lamb of a human - usually looking the wrong way for suspense. Well these zombies where a bit louder and they seemed to seek prey, but there were Grade A Hollywood tits all over the house and proudly displayed - so I gotta give back a point or two if you see it \"au natural\" - but if you see it with the tits hacked out for TV - then you have a 3.",

The dialogue doesn't even rate as banal, and the overall feeling one gets is - why did they all bother?What could possibly have made Clint Howard (a fascinating actor), sign up to be a part of this purile, juvenile, utterly atrocious piece of garbage? Maybe a few brain-dead teenagers who live in dark basements in Oatmeal Nebraska might enjoy this 'movie', but to the rest of humanity it is an embarrassing and disgusting waste of time, money and energy. (Thank God for independant cinema!)There is no characterisation, no plot, no logic, hell not even any continuity between the shots! (Just look at the scenes of the Captain alone on his boat while it is raining. In the next shot it is not raining, then cut back to him and it is raining again). To sum up, it wasn't scary, it wasn't exciting, it wasn't sexy, it wasn't anything of worth at all.",

I liked the big battle scene, but overall this film has lots of problems.Perhaps an extra month of filming, an extra four million dollars, etc would have improved things drastically. The story should have focused on Jordan and Captain Kirk, the two characters with the most charisma. I didn't mind the video game footage, but a lot of elements didn't work.Young actors with no improve skills should never be allowed to do improve. EVER.The irritating blond was simply unconvincing as a zombie beast. That scene just feels amateurish The Narrator should never, EVER open a film with the phrase \"If only they had stayed away, they'd still be alive\". This kills the movie right in the first 2 minutes.Uwe Boll's MTV style becomes a hindrance more than a help. They should have made the video game themes more consistent and campy, or else played it as a regular zombie film.I liked the Liberty character, Ona Grauer does her best, but a lot of it just falls flat.It's crazy cheese fun, but it could have been better.",

Y'know, it looked like there were a lot of smart, talented people working on this, an sort-of established director with a 'vision', a decent FX house, a producer who cared about the project, a modest budget, some decent locations, and some good art direction. What went wrong? Oh, there was zero plot, too much video game violence, zero character development, a paper-thin excuse for a historical backstory, and stupid video game images spliced in. Why? As if to say \"look, it looks like the game!\". So now we delve into the well-known depths of unrealistic video game violence that cribs too much from the style of 'the matrix'.

The film opens with a bunch of college kids who miss a boat to the \"rave of the year.\" They instead pay a fisherman over a thousand dollars to take them to the island where the rave is at. OK, why would anyone in their right mind pay that much money to go to a crappy rave. Man, those kids must be desperate for company. They arrive at the island and find the rave trashed. They soon realize that the island is inhabited by the funniest, cheapest looking zombies ever put on film. They find a crate full of guns and decide to take shelter in a house on the island. They find the house but instead of going inside, they waste bullet after bullet on the same zombie (im serious you will see the same zombie die ten times in this movie) in a 10 minute long shootout that rips off the Matrix like crazy with Karate and slow motion bullets. One thing I found hilarious bout this dumb sequence was how do these retarded college kids know how to shoot guns so well, fight with swords, and do karate? After this sequence it was very funny and a pleasure to watch these stupid kids die one after the other. The plot was stupid and ridiculous that I could not help but laugh hard at the end, but cry because I had wasted 90 minutes of my life and 4 dollars of my money on this crap. This was Uwe Boll's first video game based movie and it is not a trying effort. I don't put the blame on Boll completely, but also on the script written by Dave Parker and Mark Altman. Can't you see your script was crap? Don't waste your money on this movie. I just hope we don't see a sequel to this piece of crap.",

The Characters were 2-d at best (apart from the captain who I wanted to live so badly just so SOME good could come out of this thing) and the dialogue must have been written by someone who had only a vague idea of what human speech was and tried to dictate to a person who only spoke a foreign language.

Instead, it would better to compare this cinematic gem with what I ate for lunch today. My lunch was much better.The digital special effects were quite impressive; for instance Jurgen Prochnow was added digitally in the otherwise uncastable role of Captain Kirk, the fifteen hundred dollar ferryman to the stars. The visual transition from movie to video game to staring at the ceiling of the theater wishing it would all end was seamless, and should also really warrant some special technical consideration.2/10",

All Uwe Boll did was throw in a couple of teenagers, some idiot men, and an army colonel onto some island to kill zombies. Somehow they all are expert marksmen, martial arts expert, and a person that days live hours without blood, (see colonel). The characterization is not presented in a well- fashioned manner, just poof heres some idiots going to a rave and dying from zombies. It is never said how the hell no one knew that there were zombies, and how the colonel lived long enough to be a boss in HoTD2...

I had never heard a good word about this movie, and should have heeded others' advice to just stay away! Where do I start?The acting is so bad, it's beyond description. I can tell you this with great authority. These people will be washing cars for the rest of their lives after this debacle. Of course, the \"script\", \"plot\", and\"direction\" led them to no other course than making the best out of a 3rd grade Playhouse production. In one scene, some blonde bimbo in a tent, now aware that her lover has vanished and that the grunting noises and shadows outside spell trouble, begins to cry. Or laugh. Orboth. I swear to God to this day, I couldn't tell, that's how bad she was.The plot? Kids go to a rave, zombies attack, more \"youngsters\" arrive late, everyone is missing, they start to drink, find a house with other ravers who managed to escape, and now the zombies chase them. That's it. Oh, you think there are maybe little sub-plots happening? Nope. Nothing. Brilliant! I also love the fact that a whole rave gets jacked by the zombies, and we get to see 2 seconds of it from some goobers video camera. Thanks. Really appreciated that stroke of genius.Direction? To obviously create \"filler\" space (the whole movie is, actually), there are tons of sky cam shots flying over the boat and the island. I mean to the point of being annoying enough I was reaching for the Dramamine. They also intersperse actual clips from the video game! Are you kidding me?! Thank God I didn't pay to see this. Financially, anyway.To wrap it up, with the grace of God above, I hope nobody ever lets this man direct another movie as long as I'm alive. This is the kind of movie that unfortunately, gives the horror genre such a bad rep. Need further proof? Look at this sites Worst Movie list. I think 65% of the movies are sci-fi, horror, etc...In closing, it's a shame that movies like this are thrown to us en masse, while directors like Eric Stanze are starving making much better movies (all around) than this.

Ignore ANY review of this movie that is not a 1 (unless someday they let you choose 0).Horrible acting. Cheesy effects. No story.No matter how bad you think I'm telling you this movie is, it's worse than you are expecting.Edit: After further reading and comtemplation, I wanted to express a little more about this movie.First, there are people that have stated this movie does not belong in the bottom 100 movies. I'm not sure how they can make that an argument for grading this movie higher than it is really worth. Have they actually seen every single movie listed? I know I haven't. I don't care where my rating of this movie makes it fall in some list. All I can tell you is that the movie does not even deserve its current, artificially inflated, score.Second, the ONLY people that should view this film are film students. I think this movie would make an excellent educational tool for first-year film students so that they can get a VERY clear idea of what NOT to do.Finally, thinking more about the content of the movie, the best way to describe it is if you put a 9-year old at the helm. Imagine a young person spewing out, \"You know what would be cool?! That spinning camera effect from The Matrix! And little clips of the video game! Oh, Oh! And a weapons dealer! That would be so cool!\" Essentially, that is what this movie is. The unedited \"cool\" list of a 9-year old.

I used to believe that bad films fell into categories of terrible or so bad it's good. there is a new level. That is called, the films of Uwe Boll. This is not trying to insult the man, as I am sure he enjoys these films and making them. Michael Madsen (from Bloodrayne) hated the film but said he would work with Uwe Boll again. But no-one should be cursed to watch this. I am normally a fan of horror, even bad ones. But this is terrible. I'm beginning to sound like a broken record, but it is true. The characters were all incredibly dumb or annoying, I had no sympathy for them, and I can't even remember names. I don't care to. The dialogue is laughable (character A: You're doing this to become immortal. Why? Bad guy: To live forever). The entire thing is wholly contrived, get from point A to point B, run to C, die in D. It's full of clich\u00e9s (of course the boat was smuggling weapons. That's what happens in real life! Or does it...). And, the action sequences. Just a whole load of gunfire. Or the martial arts woman kicking zombies. And death. Allegedly for Alone In The Dark, Dr Boll (he has a doctorate in literature, you know - so why isn't the dialogue better?) changed the script to have more action and less scariness. That's all fine, if he knew how to do an action sequence. He does not. He, quite frankly, make Paul WS Anderson look like Steven Spielberg he's that bad.So all in all, the worst movie I have ever seen. And I've watched Meet the Spartans.

            "content": "\"House of the Dead\" is a great game. It may have ripped off \"Resident Evil,\" but by that logic, you can say \"Resident Evil\" ripped off George A. Romero, and so on. So when I initially heard that they were making a movie based on one of my favorite first-person shooter games, I was excited. But then I read over and over again how horrible it was, and decided to wait until it was on cable rather than blow money on it in the theater. When I finally saw it, I realized that there were no words to describe how horrible it was. Since it's based on a video game, I never expected an Oscar winner, but for God's sake - I've seen some bad movies based on video games, but this one is even worse than \"Double Dragon,\" and believe me, that's pretty bad. You almost have to TRY to make a movie this bad.Uwe Boll, you are not a director. I know you narcissistically think of yourself as \"the best in the business,\" but sooner or later, reality has to step in. In the meantime, here's a few hints to help with that reality check:1. Using the Sega logo at the rave didn't make any sense. Honestly, what band is going to have Sega as a sponsor? The New Kids On The Block reunion tour?2. Placing young rave-goers in a sudden horrific predicament won't automatically make them highly-trained counter-terrorism operatives.3. The game is called \"House of the Dead,\" not \"Shack of the Dead.\" The house in the game is an enormous mansion, not some dilapidated pile of crap in the middle of no where.4. Having Clint Howard repeat his dialog in a weird voice was just annoying as all Hell, not creepy or funny, whichever you were going for. Just let Clint Howard be Clint Howard.5. I got the \"U-boat\" and \"Captain Kirk\" jokes concerning J\u00fcrgen Prochnow. They sucked. The only way anything in this movie was funny was unintentionally.6. If people want to see scenes from the game, they'll pay fifty cents to play it, not six dollars to see them as cut scenes in a movie.7. The zombies didn't run in the game. Why should they in the movie? Face it, Boll - you're no Zack Snyder.8. Making zombies the leading authorities on tree-grabbing doesn't do much to make them terrifying.9. Chances are that ancient Spanish explorers would be speaking Spanish to each other, not English. Ever hear of subtitles?10. The mere mention of the genius of George A. Romero in this cinematic waste is almost unforgivable.As for my fellow movie-goers - especially compulsive lovers of zombie films such as myself - if you have absolutely nothing else to do, you might want to check out \"House of the Dead\" for a few laughs. Nothing else. And for the love of God, if you have to see it, see it on cable; don't rent it. I've seen plenty of excellent zombie films as well as plenty of excessively cheesy ones, and I'll tell you right now, S. William Hinzman's \"Flesheater\" was better than this one. At least that one didn't try to be something it wasn't - a cheesy zombie film. A comatose barnacle could make something better than this. The very fact that Uwe Boll didn't direct \"House of the Dead 2: Dead Aim\" implies that there may actually be hope for it.",

But I'm going to give it a shot, and by shot I mean an attempt, not shot as in the way the people in the movie were shooting the zombie slash swashbucklers.The movie starts with a guy narrating about this very unrealistic story of events. He's basically supposed to fill in the gaps of what happened on the island. I can only imagined that the director did this to avoid visually going into detail about the supposed slaughter fest that happened. OK then some people are trying to attend this rave of the century. Which is held on an island some where off the coast of nowhere. Through careful stupidity then manage to miss the boat that was suppose to carry them to the island with everyone else. Then enters Long John Silver and the grown up version of that kid that died at the beginning of \"Stephen Kings\" IT. For some reason the five people who miss the boat think of a great way to lose money and killed at the same time. They try to get Long John Silver and his first and only mate to take them to this Island (where the rave is). They tell the captain where the island is and he's all like you can't pay me enough to go there. So then the guy with the money is like \"F*** it a grand\". Then out of nowhere the captain feels like a grand is worth dieing for. WHAT THE HELL IS THAT.So they get to the Island and the rave is so over that it's not even funny. There's blood and es all over the place and only one person out the group thinks to say somethings wrong here. Everyone else is either trying to get laid or trying to get paid. That reminds me theirs this one stupid line (I mean the movie is filled with them) where the man in the yellow slicker tries to give this girl a cross to were for protection, and the girl says \"that's all right I'm on the pill\". I think that's when just about everything inside of me died. Plus the people where normal everyday people when the got to the island but when the s*** hit they where like national guard. I mean people where jumping through the air shooting shot gun shells in bullet time(aka matrix time). That reminds, this girl jumps up and shoots a zombie while the zombie is doing some kind of Jackie Chan s*** while throwing an Axe at the same time that she's shooting. Their practically standing right in front of each other( if they where standing on ground) and for some reason her bullets hit the zombie in the chest and the zombie's Axe which was headed right for her just out of nowhere misses. Plus this same girl enters the fight with some form of a hand-gun and then in a split second she's holding a shotgun bus tin rounds. It's also funny how the camera man keeps circling everyone who has a gun, I mean this goes on for what seems like hours. Oh and got to put this in my review. So there all in the house and one of the guys kicks in the door to what looks like some type of chemical lab. So there looking around when one girl happens to look into a microscope, she calls over one of the guys to look at what she's just found. Then out of nowhere this possible college kid becomes a chemist. And she's like what is it and he's like \"I've never seen anything like it\" then he's pause and says \"But it's fuc**** genius\". After that I think I blacked out from lack of stupidity.All and all this movie cuts deep into the wrist of horror movie fans.",

That was the worst part of the film! The story was OK. The linear story direction was put well. Now the visuals had its great points and annoying points. It had great action scenes, especially the camera angles of the bullets flying and zombies dying! But the part that irritated me was the video game scene transitions. Why show the video game at all? In my opinion, it would have been better to just have the scene transitions normal and not show how the film compares to the game.

There was plenty of \"blood and guts\" therein, but sometimes the \"blood and guts\" wasn't where it was supposed to be. For example: when one's midsection and down is severed off by zombies one would think there would be excessive blood and maybe some intestines. Actually, this movie doesn't think so. In one instance a woman's legs and midsection are eaten off by zombies and her lover saves her and they chat briefly. The \"blood\" bled from her severed torso looks like water with some seriously diluted red food coloring. Aside from lack of \"blood and guts\" in this movie the violence also seems cheaply done. Much of the violence looks fake and really won't push that feeling of gore. Lastly, the zombies in the film looked and acted pretty dumb. They would run around growling and snarling, and it pretty much amounted to about as much as a poorly executed Halloween joke. By no means should anyone in their right mind see this movie for any price. Even if it's free.",

I don't care how many times you've beaten the arcade game, just don't watch it. The movie has little to do with the game. Even the stupid flashes of game play footage in the movie don't help. In the game, you went to a house and killed zombies. Little storyline, lots of action, many quarters down the drain. The movie has some sort of a story line that's not worth remembering.Bad things: The kids want to go to a rave. First of all, they are rich white kids (with a black girl, to be fair I guess) who have nothing better to do. I've never been to a rave, but I thought that people who went to raves were...well, ravers! These kids did NOT strike me as X popping' Techno heads.The kids, ravers or not, sucked. The characters were so thin that I swear my corneas got paper cuts just by watching them. The acting was so bad, I was cheering when they got attacked by the zombies.Why was the rave during DAYLIGHT HOURS!? I thought raves took place in dark locations, like abandoned warehouses. Then the flashing lights have more of a dramatic effect on your ecstasy-induced stupor. No, this rave took place in broad daylight. The attendees didn't look like ravers. In fact, they looked like random extras semi-dancing around (which is what they were). And, the techno music sucked.Gotta love the gun play, really. The kids went from being whiny losers to gun-toting Special Forces operatives. Just like that. They were SO skilled, that they never reloaded their guns. The dude with the Desert Eagle? He shot that thing like 15 times in one scene! He's so 1337 that a 7 round magazine means nothing to him! Even more awesome? There was no noticeable recoil either! Even when that one chick used the shotgun? Her arms didn't jump. THAT's what I call real ultimate power.And the zombies sucked too. The zombies were apparently Navy SEALs in a past life, because they knew how to swim. One thing bothers me, though: When they were swimming with their heads above the water, you could see their breath. Zombies are cold dead magically reanimated flesh. No WARM BREATH CLOUDS.And some of the zombies...looked like extras wearing face paint. I mean really, couldn't Uwe afford to get REAL zombies? Pssh.In the end, don't watch it. Unless you're drunk.

Aside from this horror flick being everything but scary, the acting I must say was horrible, everything from Liberty's fight scenes, to the zombies, to the discharging of the weapons was completely horrid. Especially annoying was the officer's role in the movie, she came out of nowhere, and presented no buy-able actions that would hint that she were an officer. It also seemed as if in injuries were non-lasting, given that the main Axe-swinger was a man with an impaled hand.

I had never seen it before and felt it was an interesting idea(though not done perfectly it was done well). Then the bullet-time camera stuff and Matrix-like camera shots were totally whacked. I usually stop movies with stuff like that but this time I let it go since it was still entertaining. **SPOILER**The ending was a bit lame, what with the built up zombie guy dead and the two walking off \"into the sunset\". **SPOILER**If you don't expect a Romero movie(which, in a very lame way, are mentioned), if you don't expect an epic, and if you like some bad jokes, then House of the Dead is a hit.

The video game scenes were weird, although I did enjoy the opening credits, and the way the camera circled around a character was pretty pointless. Yet it's corniness charmed me. Most importantly, the flow of the movie kept me going. A pure action flick with VERY stylized violence. There are some nice tidbits here and there, like when Castillo put his tongue into the girls ear. Very disturbing moment to say the least. I think he made a fun popcorn movie where people can make fun of it, but have a good time because of the movie itself. Also, I enjoyed the effects a lot, and was a fan of the zombie make-up/gore.",

But I know that being bad is some-kind-of merit too and I'm interested in movies based on games so I rented this.Movie starts promisingly with calm and cool narrator voice who tells about his friends. In this point dialog is funny and clever but immediately when the narrator stops there starts simple and clumsy dialog. I wrote that kind of dialog when I was six years old. Actors have no energy in their performances expect with that raincoat man but either his character or his acting is annoying.Script has no surprises and plot is nearly invisible. They just go to some mysterious rave party in some mysterious island (Who arraigned that anyway?) and start to slaughter zombies when they attack. Characters reactions are unbelievable (I would mourn more if my friend became eaten by zombies) and their weapon skills are unrealistically good. I'm pretty sure that if they are first timers they can't shoot that well (or swing a sword on that matter) but how should I know since I haven't used any weapon in my life.Uwe Boll tries to differ from gray director mass but any directing solution doesn't work. The worst mistake is adding parts from House of the Dead games in middle of action scenes. They cut them too much and make it feel like a video game even though it should feel like a movie. Action scenes are horrible anyway because there is added many cool camera angles which make it messy. Some times camera is just way too close. Also that rap music is bad and makes it feel like a comedy.In summary this movie is worse than Battlefield Earth. Even that cool narrator changes energy-less and rushing in the end. Two funny jokes are not enough to save this. This film will be remembered as a true classic but from wrong reasons.",

House of the Dead is not a film in the traditional sense. Sure it's a combination of a dozen other Zombie movies combined with a MTV style by way of the Matrix, but that isn't why HoD can be considered something other than a normal spook flic. HoD was shot in a way that deliberately de-emphasized the narrative nature of film. HoD, like Tomb Raider before it, was based upon a video game, but unlike other movies based upon video games, this thing never wanted to stray from what inspired it. Actual shots from the video game are interspersed into the multiple action sequences that make up HoD.Now, this obviously destroys any semblance of suspending disbelief. Shots of Playstation zombies getting their comeuppance during the middle of a cinematic zombie battle make sure that you are brought back to reality. There is no horror here; Hod screams at you, \"hey dummy, this is just a video game. Settle back and enjoy the carnage!\" ...and the carnage is quite good. I'm not sure that I was aware that there was this many ways to splatter a member of the living dead.I could discuss the cast, the \"plot\", or even the lame script, but what's the point really? House of the Dead is just a 90 minute back story to a reasonably popular video game. If you think you'd like that sort of thing, you'll like this.

Oh god! And one of the comments says, \"The Dawn of the Dead meets The Matrix\". Right, that's it, I'm buying this! This was the excited hysteria that followed me finding this movie. You see, I am a HUGE fan of The House Of The Dead video game. I didn't even know this movie existed. I also like old zombie movies. I also like the Matrix. However, unknowingly, I had made one the worst mistakes of my film watching life.So, here I am, at home. I put the DVD in my player, and as the interactive menu appears, I hear the voice-over man from the original arcade game saying, \"The House.... OF THE DEAD.\" A buzz of nostalgia washes over me. So, I press select, and the film starts playing. For the next 87 minutes, I was in a depressed, suicidal state.How could they do this to a legendary game? Make it a pile of trash? How could I describe this movie in three words? How about this movie sucks. The \"special\" effects look like they've been thrown together by a confused four year old. I've seen acting superior acting to this in a porn film. The entire film is so frustratingly hard to understand, that you feel like tearing your hair out. The plot is one of the very worst I've encountered. The entire film is a crying shame. And would throwing in a bunch of clips from the game completely at random make it any better, even for a die hard House Of The Dead fan like me? No. In fact, it makes it even worse, seeing your favourite game reduced to nothing. The cast are complete unknowns, (sometimes, this can be to a films advantage, e.g 28 Days Later, Blair Witch Project, but it makes it worse here)it has zilch production values and the director (Uwe Boll) is well known for his trashy game to film conversions.In fact, I've done a little research on Uwe Boll, and I've found this. He has made SEVEN game to film conversions. EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM IS CONSIDERED COMPLETE TRASH. And guess what? He's planning to make another three.The message is clear: DON'T BUY THIS MOVIE. House Of The Dead fans, don't be tempted by the name. Watching this will only make your love of the game shrink.",

A movie of truly god like proportions, the cinematography is just beautiful and epic, the bold direction brings to mind Bergman or an early Hitchcock, the editing fantastic, (the way they break up scenes with screen-shots from the game is utterly mind blowing and truly original) and overall production is on par with movies such as Ben hur, then there's the acting, well if ever there was a masterclass of performances then this is surely it, including deeply moving performances from such sought after and highly respected actors like Clint Howard, this movie just couldn't get any better, plus it could quite possibly be the best movie of Jurgen Prochnow's career, from Daz boot to house of the dead, he really has come far, all I can hope is that they have a sequel in the works as I'm desperate to enter the world of this survival horror classic once again.

However when I rented this abysmal film, I had no idea what I was getting into.First - there's the plot itself. 5 People head out to an island to be a part of the hottest rave of the century (which by the way, looks like it would've sucked to begin with) only to find a handful of survivors and an island full of the undead. From here, survival becomes their only thought as they desperately try to escape the island. It's possible that this could have been successfully written despite most video game to movies being rather unsuccessful however this movie fails rather adeptly. Plot holes are large enough for an army of zombies to march through as issues such as how the virus is spread, how there seem to be more zombies than originally started on the island and many more are never addressed.Second - there's the absolutely terrible acting. These people mustve just been hired out of a college acting class because they hardly bring across any of the emotions your supposed to feel. Along with this comes the special effects: overdone, repetitive and taken almost right out of the Matrix itself with no effort made to bring originality into the mix.This movie, terribly done and a pain to watch, deserves nothing more than a 1 as it really isnt worth the 5 bucks to rent.",

            "content": "Uwe Boll has taken what could have been a great horror movie and turned it into a textbook example of how to create a truly atrocious licensed movie. The writing in House of the Dead is so bad you will be rooting for the zombies, if for no other reason than they don't talk. The dialog varies between gratuitous and painful, with the occasional welcome sprinkle of unintelligible. Characters frequently exceed the normal stupidity found in most zombie movies, often deciding to run into the massive horde of undead instead of away from them. Of course, while the undead vary quite widely from the tree-leaping lupine zombies to the slow, lumbering, and kind-of-lost zombies, they are by far Hollywood's least threatening monsters. They are so weak they can be felled by a single bullet, and even lose several knife fights. Forget about smashing through walls, these zombies can't even push over small pieces of wood blocking windows.OK, so the writing is atrocious, the plot is terrible, and the zombies are paper-thin. But at least there is a great, grand house like in the videogames, and is beautifully filmed to take maximum effect from each scene, right? Sadly, no. While in the videogames the house of the dead could easily be described as a mansion, here it is a tiny and run-down two-room affair... An outhouse of the dead, if you will. Even the now-infamous shots of the house spliced in from the videogames look more convincing. And yes, the movie makers do splice in shots from the video game. And every time a character dies they get a death animation stolen from Resident Evil. And they use the Matrix special effect about 30 times. Even if you discount these atrocious effects, the normal cinematography is still so bad Gilbert Godfried would be ashamed to show it on USA's Up All Night. The only visual effects that really worked were of the zombie's exploding heads, which while not terrifying were surprisingly satisfying. We came into this fully expecting a bad movie, only to be surprised by the true depth this movie achieves. Characters throw up on each other. Zombies swim. People arrive at an empty rave full of blood-soaked clothing and immediately have sex. Within the first 30 minutes no fewer than six breasts had been exposed. Did I mention that zombies lose knife fights? If you're looking for a truly awful movie, look no further. This is it. This is the standard by which all bad movies will be judged in the future.",

Boll is a good figure to look at if you are an aspiring filmmaker. This film can be used as a example in low budget film-making. How to or how not to do is up to you. All other things aside, this is a horrible attempt at a zombie flick, and the fact that it is based on a video game, doesn't help it either. Johnathan Cherry and Jurgen Prochnow are the only \"actors\" here, as the rest of the cast should have been buried with this film in a movie vault far, far away.

            "content": "There are actually two kinds of game-adaptation movies: good ones, like Resident Evil, for example, and bad ones, like... like House of the Dead. However, this was not simply a bad movie: it was more like strange, stupid, pointless, AND bad. Oh, and let's not forget dumb - from all angles.First of all, the story... let's see. A few kids are running up and down, chased by zombies, and eventually getting caught only to die a completely meaningless and unnecessary death. And this is not a plot summary, this is the whole story! I imagine the screenplay didn't have much more details than this. Then, the acting. Now that was funny... except for Jurgen Prochnow the actors were young \"talents\", but they didn't show much, mostly ran around screaming or shooting, before ending up dead. Fortunately the characters had no details and dimensions at all, so I didn't feel sorry for them when all of a sudden they died the most stupid way they could (one moment they were fighting like combat marines, the next they were zombie food, like if the director decided it was their turn to sacrifice themselves for nothing).Other than those, there were a few remarkable effects in the movie I can't help mentioning. Before anyone starts to guess how much it resembled the game, I tell you: a hundred and ten per cent. First of all, there were scenes cut out directly from the arcade version of the game and placed into the movie one-in-one. This means you see the kids shooting, then for a sec you get a shooting scene from the game, then you see the kids again. There were plenty of such 'tricks' here and there - how very original, artistic, and incredibly DUMB of the director... Otherwise, fights were exactly the same as in the game, but seeing it in an arcade is more entertaining than in a movie. Imagine kids with huge guns, totally unaware of their lives being at stake or their friends getting killed time after time, shooting at countless zombies swarming around them (really, there were lots of scenes where you saw one of the \"heroes\" in slow-motion, shooting at a zombie running at him, while there were dozens of other monsters just running around, clearly without any intention to attack). Then, throw in a few bullett time effects (or something remotely alike), where there is your hero shooting/kicking/grinning, and the camera goes around him like in the player selection of any prestigeous arcade game. This looks good in the one-millionth episode of the Mortal Kombat series, but come on, are we doing a movie here or what? Dumb again.Finally, a few words about the genre... just to see clearly. Horror... there was a significant amount of blood for sure, but the zombies looked more like old men and women, and seeing them chewing on the characters was laughable at most. Thriller - why so? I was not afraid a bit, only astonished by all this movie had to give. Mystery, now that's true: in the last 10 minutes or so, the remaining heroes uncovered an old legend connected to the zombies, which, however, didn't play any role at all in the plot. It just... WAS. And, to say the least, it was DUMB. Action? I give you that. There was plenty of it, from all kinds: all-out, frontal, gunpowder-smelling, sweaty, bullett-timey, arcade action. Dumb and pointless, that's true, but actionindeed.What else should I say? I would recommend this movie to any who wants a good laugh at a stupid zombie flick with poor acting and no story. Otherwise - you may as well skip it and see a real horror movie.No secret: 1 of 10",

I've never seen such an entertaining bad movie as HOTD. Most really bad movies are extremely low budgeted and mostly just boring. HOTD however has got a fast pacing and a crazy visual style to it like no other bad movie has ever had before. The sets are equally comic. Like they were leftovers from an old Ed Wood movie. The visuals mostly make no sense at all. But they ads to the unintentional comedy and has some crazy matrix like zombie action together with insert shots from the video game. The zombies are of the fast running kind and their makeup is hilarious. Not to forget the rave music throughout the whole movie and the rave party invaded by a horde of the living dead. It certainly is the most entertaining bad movie I've ever seen. House of The Dead is the worst of the movies made by Uwe Boll that I've seen of so far. But it is also his most entertaining one. The whole movies is fast paced throughout. His other efforts are mostly very slow-paced between the hilarious scenes of action that's a trademark of Uwe Boll. The photography is unexpectedly good looking. Uwes strong point has always been that he's a good technician. He just doesn't know how to use the visuals to make any kind of sense. It only ads to the comical effect. If one watches Uwe Bolls latest efforts one can clearly see that he has improved a lot as a filmmaker over the years. He still has a long way to go. But it seems like he continues to learn by his mistakes and improve on his faults. And that is something the man deserves some credit for. Most people never does. It will surely be very interesting to see how his movies in the years to come will turn out. I'm not sure how to grade this movie because it entertained me a lot but for all the wrong reason.",

At first, why does Uwe Boll have to make movie adoption's out of a popular game series? Because he doesn't know how. Let me give you a brief history before this movie was made and it was very bad.In 1996, Sega made a light gun series call House of the Dead, and it was first as a arcade game but it became so, so, popular that it actually get ported to any other consoles. And thus making a sequel, and this became very popular too. Spawning a another sequel, House of the Dead III (2002), making the idea of Uwe Boll's movie game adaption. There was a another sequel that spawned call \"House of the Dead 4\". Possibly one of Sega's most successful franchises, and thanks to Wow Entertainment, a helper of Sega, or I think a subsidiary.And it all comes to a bad movie adaption directed by Uwe Boll called \"House of the Dead\". At first, I thought it was gonna be exciting and fun, and possibly one of my first Uwe Boll's movies that I watch, I think. At course, the problems are that there is a limited budget, uh oh, a limited budget? That means it is a box office flop. And a unknown cast meaning it is a poor cast, and a routine storyline (a silly plot, or poor plot, or a stupid plot, I guess). And a unbashed B-movie in the whole 21st century! And plus, I don't know anything about Brightlight Pictures thus it is my first film that is ever distributed by Brightlight Pictures. At first, I was thinking is this anything but a stupid film corporation? Look, I know that for a lot of fans of Uwe Boll will be disappointed and hate Uwe Boll anyway. The movie is about:Two guys name Simon and whoever it is going into the haunted house (I think), and then suddenly have to fight some zombies. Right?No, unfortunately, became very bad. Because at first, generally that Artisan Entertainment made a lot of bad movies during the 80s except for Weekend at Bernie's, which we have the 1989 VHS print made by I've (International Video Entertainment), and I guess, that we have a another one, a very good movie called \"Piano\", and it was during Live Home Video's life. During the start of International Video Entertainment, they made bad movies, as well as Parade VIdeo, and Deal-a-Meal is a unknown company and lived shortly, only distributed the first two videos of Richard Simmons' Sweatin' to the Oldies, which I am sorry if I am off- topic. Now back into the review: Let's say about this, I think this is the final film made by Artisan Entertainment before they were acquired and folded in into Lionsgate Home Entertainment, which also Lions Gate Home Entertainment usually folded in TriMark Pictures in 2000. And does this mean you are a way thinking this is the 21st century's big acquisition? And plus, Stay away of this movie. And stay away from this god awful movie. And stay away from Uwe Boll's films. Really, and yes, be careful with Brightlight Pictures.",

            "content": "I'd just like to say to the film makers - why? This is probably the worst movie I've seen, well, ever really. In case you didn't know - and you would within 10 minutes of the film starting - this film is based on the Sega video game series, although it seemed to me to be more like some kind of extended advert for the game. The 'plot' goes something like this... Five 'young people' (looking like 30 somethings) are going to a rave on an island in the middle of nowhere but they can't tell time and miss the boat! Lucky them? Oh no, they've got more money than sense and soon hire an old fishing boat to take them to their deaths. Oops, did I miss something? No I don't think I did, that's it really. Oh and there are many scantily clad women running around for no reason. Could this film get any worse? From the boat captain called 'Kirk' (cue the bad Star Trek jokes) to the first mate who looks like the killer from 'I Know What You Did Last Summer', complete with hook thingy, this film rips off everything and anything. Sega gets in on the game (sorry, no pun intended) with some neat advertising by sponsering the rave, not to mention the bloody annoying flashes of the game every now and then. This was supposed to be an actual movie wasn't it?Even the action is stripped down to the camera spinning around the shooting characters and zombie parts flying about the place. This is not good film making, nor does it look like something from the matrix, it just started to make me feel quite nauseated after a while, no maybe that was just the sick feeling of having actually spent money to see this or of wasting an hour and a half of my life. Even for a movie based on a game this is bad. At least Resident Evil had some style (not to mention a decent cast and some kind of plot other than just things being shot/hacked to pieces) and Wing Commander had Freddie Prinze Jr (and this was worse, do you understand how bad it is?) The most disturbing thing about this film though had to be the ending. Nicely open for a sequel... Please please no, don't do it. No No No....",

Obviously, the director and the writers of this story have never fired any type of firearm. No everyday 18 year old, female, party freak pothead can fire two 9 millimeters with dead-on accuracy and no kickback. Uwe Boll said on a behind-the-scenes look that he enjoyed the Romero movies but he was just speeding things up. What a moron, I guess no one told him about 28 days later.

Now, I'm not going to spoil this movie for anybody who might not have seen it, but I'll just give you a little NON-SPOILING teaser-like thing. Just to give you context. IT'S HORRIBLE!!! This is how the movie was made: The director grabbed every bad movie that was ever made by human being, all of the worst dialogue and shoved it into a shotgun. Then the director pulled the trigger and then picked up the pieces and placed them all nicely on a table and then grabbed a bazooka and blew up what was left of the movies/screenplays. But somehow a few pieces managed to stay intact. So he sent the writer to pick up all the pieces of the movie and tried to make a script out of it (TRIED) and failed miserably. He thought he was making a script, but nothing seemed right. But he didn't care. He just handed that to the actors and they TRIED to read it, but it was so confusing and stuff that they thought it was a combination of Peruvian/Russian/Japanese and Elvish (from Lord of the Rings) Obviously, one language is hard enough to learn and one of these languages shouldn't even be known by the average Joe and plain Jane. But the actors didn't care. They TRIED to read but got nothing and then lost the scripts an eighth of the way through shooting.Then the actors go to the director for... well... DIRECTION!!! (an amazing unheard concept. I mean, whoever heard of a director giving directions? Hmm) Well, he finally decided to help. But this guy is a big fat guy and he forgot what movie he was making. So trying to make himself sound like he still knew what he was doing, he just kept saying stuff like, \"okay and then... this person shows up... and then... you die... No the zombie won't kill you. It's part of the drama. Just lie there and pretend to die. yeah, good. Perfect.\" but in the end, he realized that this wasn't helping and... well, actually, he did something really smart. As in, seriously, this was pretty cool. No other director could have pulled it off. (ie: Spielberg, Lucas, Jackson) The director went to get a lobotomy.Then he came back and WITH A PSYCHIC TRANSLATOR. Interesting enough, this psychic translator believed that he could read the minds of vegetables. (Which doesn't make sense because the part of their mind that allows thought is gone) But he couldn't really. So the actors turned to them for help and asked the translator what the director was thinking. But he couldn't understand anything. (Amazing) He was reading his OWN mind, but he still didn't get it. He thought he was hearing a combination of German/Russian and a form of Slavic. And the best part is, this psychic translator is a fat little Egyptian kid with a twinky in his mouth. And he telling the actors what he thinks the director is saying but he doesn't speak English. But the actors (smart as they are) think that they know what he's saying a begin improvising the whole damn movie.That's pretty much what you've got. My advise to you, see it if you must. You will not like it, and if you do, tell me why. I haven't the slightest idea how you can like this movie. You can enjoy it maybe, but not like it.(By the way, I have nothing against Egyptians. I think they are a highly underrated people. I am not trying to insult anyone who is Egyptian or a vegetable. Even if you were involved with House of the Dead.) So all in all, bad movie, save your time, not worth it unless you want to make fun of it. -10/10. (yeah, it's that good.)",

Bad acting, bad effects, bad script, bad everything! The plot follows a group of teen cliche's on their way to a rave (that takes place in broad daylight) at a remote island. However, when the group arrives, all they find is an empty dance floor and bloody clothes. Determined to find out what happened to the rest of the party-goers, the clan set's off on a mission through a zombie-infested forest. During this crusade, they are aided by a police chick and a sea captain that just happens to have the right number of weapons to give to each of the kids. They also meet up with Jonathan Cherry and some other survivors. Basically the rest of the movie is a collection of poorly directed action sequences including a far too long shootout outside of the \"house of the dead.\" This fight came complete with cheesy Hollywood violence, redundant clips from the HOTD video game, and sloppy matrix-esque camera rotations. One of the character's even volunteers to sacrifice himself to save the others. Why? Not because he was noble and brave, but because part of his face got scarred by acid a zombie spat on him after he continued to beat the creature long after it had been disabled! I'm supposed to feel sorry for this guy?!?\nTo sum it all up, there is absolutely no point in seeing this movie unless you want to see for yourself just how terrible it is.   The theater I was in was more dead than the zombies on the screen, and I'm sure the money I wasted seeing this piece of sh*t could easily cover the costs it took to make it. GRADE: F",

I would call it a B movie but I feel that would insult actual B movies. This is more like a Z movie. Even the \"innovative\" things they do aren't really new. We saw better running zombies in 28 Days Later. We saw better video game remakes in the mediocre but far superior Resident Evil movies. Why was this movie made? Who said \"Hey! Let's get Uwe Boll and a bunch of awful actors along with a famous German actor and set them on an island in the middle of a rave. But wait! Everyone at the rave is missing and this doesn't strike any of them as strange! And they all magically learn how to use weapons! Especially the black girl who somehow manages to do hand to hand battle with a presumed zombie sword master.\" Why did that German guy from Das Boot (I forget his name right now) decide to do a video game remake by Boll? He's actually talented. In the case of zombie invasion this movie does give us many clues of what not to do. Don't waste bombs by throwing them down wells. Don't stand in the middle of an open clearing to shoot zombies when there's a house 10 feet away that you could hide in. When a hand erupts from someone's chest, don't just stand there, run away. And most importantly, when someone wants to become immortal, it is most likely so that they can live forever.",

Sometimes that plan blows up in my face and I can't sleep for a couple days after, but THIS...man, what a fun ride.The biggest laughs I got were from watching the zombies. These babies ain't the classic moan and shamble along type, but the kind that could form their own nation and dominate the Olympics. They could run, swim, jump, and most importantly, get blown up in gooey bits of red goodness. Half the time you could see the trampolines they jump off of and I swear that I saw one zombie's mask fall off.In one of the rare lucid moments that make you say \"how did they do that?\" in a Uwe Boll film, a girl jumps in the air with her shotgun and the film hits bullet time. It spins to her full body profile until she shoots the gun, where the camera zooms in and follows the buckshot whizzing through the air and eventually into a zombie's gut. After that it's more shits and giggles.Put it simply, you're not gonna get scared once throughout this film. You're just going to laugh and use it as proof that Hollywood ran out of good and original ideas, especially when they splice in some footage from the video game (those parts didn't make me laugh; they made me stifle colorful comments pretaining to the producer's state of mind at the time).

Someone whom I went with wanted to see Once Upon a Time in Mexico, however since we went to a Regal theater, somehow there were projection issues before the trailers were even shown. It wasn't going to start so I figured we can get refunded and call it a night. Fortunately, the box office was still open, but as they were about to close since all of the last shows were about to start, we couldn't get refunded. It was suggested that we'd see a different movie. Well, the person I was with really liked horror movies, so I made the suggestion of seeing House of the Dead. Neither of us really knew what it was about, although I remembered it was based on a video game. How bad could it be, I wondered. This movie was excruciating. To think that I, 25 years old at the time, should've known better, would even consider watching this trash. It's incredible.I haven't seen it since, nor would I ever want to witness it again. I figured I'd leave a review since I just rated it, and never speak of it anymore. I vaguely remember it. A group of youngsters going to a rave (this is 2003 after all, although I personally have never been to one) and encounter zombies.This is mostly an action movie from what I remember. It isn't even horror. It's not scary at all. One thing I do remember is that whenever a character would be fighting off zombies, they'd stand in the center of the frame holding some automatic weapon and firing at the oncoming zombies, then there would be a Matrix-style effect of a pause, or bullet time, or whatever it was, but it was EMBARRASSING.Embarrassing to watch, I felt. This movie is mind-numbing. Just a complete atrocity. Of course, there's zero character development, but there isn't even any tension. Nothing worthwhile here. The fact that we even stayed until the end credits... After we exited the theater, we didn't even really talk about it. I don't remember having a conversation about it.",

Not only is the plot a rehash of every other horror movie - although it was claimed to be based on the very popular video game - but the directing and editing of this piece of dreg are what drive this movie to an average rating of around 2 (I'm actually surprised it's that high.) The interlacing of video game zombie shots, the almost never-ending fight sequence in the cemetery, the \"Matrix\" effects, and so on, also put this movie way, way over the edge. I actually greatly enjoy those \"so-bad-they're-good\" movies, but this is by far no where near that level. Luckily, I had rented this waste of media instead of buying it because I would have used it to pick up my dog's sh!t out in the back yard. 'Nough said about this crappy movie!",

The movie starts off on the wrong foot with an opening credit sequence that has so much flashing lights and obnoxious 'techno' music that I am surprised that my eyes did not bleed.If the intro was not enough to tell you that the movie was not worth watching, the scene that comes after that blatantly tells you that you have wasted your money by having the main character state that every character except him had died, which kills the anticipation of wondering who the next victim will be which brings me to my next point, why did Uwe Boll decide to kill off all the female characters? Although I can feel no sympathy for the Asian chick in the distasteful stars-and-stripes catsuit or the other dame whose boobs fly all over the place even when she is standing still but it is dishonorable to the art of cinema to have no girls survive in a horror movie. The plot of this movie makes no sense, after-all, who would want to go to a rave hosted by Sega? That washed-up company would only have enough money to put this so-called \"Rave of the Century\" to an inconvenient location. Only sixteen people would be stupid enough to think that a tiny outdoor rave in the middle of the woods, on the center of a remote island that is teeming with zombies would think it would be cool to go there. Realistically, the movie is pretty accurate about what a rave hosted by Sega would look like which awards the movie one star above complete trash. Instead of ranting on about how awful the script is, here is an example of a typical line in HoD (as stated by the main character whose name I forget) \"You created these zombies so you could be immortal, why?\", way to answer your own question, you dimwit. the camera work in this movie gave me motion sickness; during the sword fight scene, the camera just goes around in perpetual circles around the characters as they duel to the death. The \"best\" scene in HoD defines unnecessary cinematography. The sudden appearance spliced-in video game footage is dissociating and the part where the chick with the jiggling breasts jumps up and fires the shotgun with liberal use of 'bullet-time' is beyond ridiculous. This movie is not only a travesty to the movie industry but everything that comes into contact with it dies a little on the inside (or in the case of baby rabbits, makes them burst into flames). DO NOT set your eyes on it lest you become possessed by Lucifer.",

            "content": "Some say that making a video game into a movie premise is simply not possible. Video games just have a harder time since A) Nothing has changed peoples minds about the issue about video game movies being trashy throw away entertainment and B) Video game movies thus far HAVE primarily been trashy, throw-away entertainment. But look what else has been turned into movies successfully: Pirates of the Caribbean (a theme park ride), Transformers (a line of toys), Alvin & the Chipmunks (a high pitch vocals singing Christmas songs), etc... Whether you liked the films or not, these examples have all been commercially successful, meaning that, with enough ingenuity and a good writer(s), ANYTHING can be turned into a 'successful' movie. Maybe video game movies have just doing something wrong all these years...'House of the Dead' first of what has been (and is sure to be) the rocky marriage between video game movies and filmmaker Uwe Boll. Based on a rail-shooter (where the movements and directions are predetermined by the game, all you have to do is point and fire), 'House of the Dead' is not a particularly deep game to begin with. The premise of the video games is typically a detective looking for someone, fighting their way through hordes of the undead and the undead's friends. Mr. Boll's film is about teenagers going to a rave and eventually find themselves fighting an zombies. Rather than using an original idea, Boll and the writers go for a well-worn, tried and true 'horny and stupid teenagers up to no good, find selves in supernatural trouble' path. Everyone in the film is a stereotype, and the actors know it. In the first two minutes upon character introductions, you can tell who lives and who dies. The premise, though over used, works for the film, in a super trashy way.The parts only equal the whole in the film, because most of the parts are so small compared to the glue which holds them altogether; the jaw droppingly inane, over the top action sequences. Yes, the movie is missing direction, acting is sub-pare, and special effects are hilariously bad. But it all works! The movie has recently been re-released as a 'funny' version of the movie. I have yet to view it, but there is nothing as charming as the original film: it takes itself seriously and is completely UNself-aware. For 90 minutes of brisk 'bad' movie fun, you can do a lot worse, but a viewing with a few friends, it could be one for the ages.",

The characters are so pathetically one-sided and plot is just a train wreck. The worst scene (which is probably supposed to be the best) is when they run through the field of zombies to get the house. Even though its only about 30 feet it takes them 15 minutes to get there and they traverse half a mile. The field is crawling with zombies but somehow there are never more than one or two zombies near a character at any time. I can't imagine how anyone can think this is a good movie... I think the positive reviews of this movie must be done by people paid by the studio.And although the movie did not break the cardinal rule of showing a good movie in the middle of your bad movie, they did feel the need to name drop Romero, as if to say, \"'member these awesome zombie movies?Too bad you're watching this crapfest!\"0 out of 100 stars.",

This is NOT I repeat NOT a reason to see the movie, it has nothing to do with the games. Hell, they should have called it Shack of the Dead(more on that later)Lets start with the story..... I think there's a story buried in here somewhere, not that the game had a good story or anything, but Christ. Here's what you need to know....Kid 1, 2, and 3 want to go to an island apparently called \"island of the dead\"(wonder why?) so they pay some guy named captain kirk(not kidding) and his first mate(Clint Howard, boy has he sank low....) to take them there. Unknown to them, the party on the island has been crashed by some zombies(aka: guys in rubber masks) who begin munching on everyone(gasp) after a bit of nudity and drinking(so original). Kirk and Clint eventually make it to the island with the kids who jump off board and go to the ruined party site. I would explain the rest of the movie but I think you know what happens....Now we move on to the....er...\"acting\"(?).... Hmm, ever seen a movie where random teenagers become cannon fodder for mindless monsters because the writer made that their parts? think of that and dumb it down a little bit....Special Effects? some guys in rubber masks, some guys with fake blood on their face, some bra less zombie chicks with thin shirts. Don't worry, you'll get to know the zombies well throughout the movie as they continue to appear even after getting killed. For some reason the director(Mr. boll) felt that an overabundance of slow motion rotation shots would equal a good movie. When you see this for the second or third time it gets really old, but don't worry, there's plenty of these in the movie for those with short term memory loss!Characters? Well, there's kid 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. 7 of them die in clich\u00e9' fashions. There's Captain Kirk who apparently turned the infinite ammo cheat on as he is somehow able to shoot a handgun 20 times without having to reload. There's Clint....There's some guy with stitches on his face for some reason, and I think there's a few topless people in there on a few scenes.There's a few things worth mentioning as well....*In the game, the house of the dead was a mansion. In the movie, the house of the dead is a nice little shack.*Someone gets their legs chopped off at some point. It isn't the leg chopping itself that's weird, it's that the legs are so perfectly amputated(chopped with axes and torn)*A character in the movie is stupid enough to ask a villain why he's trying to be immortal, the villain humorously responds \"to live forever\"*There's a scene in the movie where the characters begin shooting zombies in a tunnel, the movie shifts to scenes from the house of the dead arcade game to remind the fans that they're watching their favorite video game being mocked.Conclusion? Horrible video game adaptation(surprise, surprise, surprise!)makes unintentionally hilarious movie. This movie is almost funnier than any comedy you will see for a long time. Wait till it's on TV to watch it, although if you're that impatient, rent it. DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE!",

I take that back... their inept handling and subsequent removal of Stargate Universe attests to their incompetence, so, now that I think of it, they're probably one of the only cable networks that would air this woefully inadequate film.

            "content": "Oh. My. God. This movie was terrible - even worse than I expected. At least they got the gratuitous nudity in early on, and Clint Howard made his seventeen zillionth cameo - but holy CRAP, that was terrible.The friggin' cuts to scenes from the House of the Dead Sega game were mystifying... as in, \"Why the heck did they put those shots of the game in the film? Was it to show us that at least the VIDEO GAME had some moments of suspense? UGH!\"Boll clearly does NOT understand pacing, how to establish mood, or even how to build up a feeling of dread within the viewer, knowing that something bad is going to happen, but not expecting when. Lemme tell ya, something BAD happened, all right - this movie got MADE in the first place!I really don't know where to begin describing how horrible this thing was - the score seemed to be written by the same guy that did the Scooby Doo cartoons, and since there was a Scooby Doo reference in the flick, I wouldn't be surprised if that was indeed the case. In the big fight scene with all the stupid 360 degree shots (yup, another Matrix/Bullet Time steal), the zombies would (in most cases) just walk past \"our heroes\", I suppose to go after other, more well-armed prey - yep, the ones that would be better suited to blow their heads off.Even opportunities that the \"director\" had to give us some cheap scares (like when the lady cop was under the blanket - I figured for SURE she'd crawl out from it and attack \"Curien\" and his woman), he chose not to. Or when \"Liberty\" or the black girl are killed, you think that perhaps they will join the zombie hordes, but nope, they just stay dead, never to reappear.Of course, the dialogue was completely laughable - there are so many examples to cite, that I can't even specify one, although that \"here's an old book - maybe it will help us\" was particularly memorable. The makeup was probably left over from school projects Tom Savini did when he was in Kindergarten. Oh, and the stunts and action scenes? It looks like everyone that goes to a rave is an action star that \"knows kung fu\" - heck, even the ZOMBIES seemed to know their martial arts. Let's not forget the foreshadowing - one of the first lines Rudy Curien says is that he broke up with his girlfriend to concentrate on his studies, and so she could focus on her fencing. \"I don't see how that's useful\", he tells us, and it was pretty obvious that her fencing \"skills\" would come up later in the film. I was right, but when watching that scene, I thought to myself, \"looks like she needs a LOT more training!\". Of course, when they show the group of friends during his voice-over, he mentions that they're all dead now - which is an EXCELLENT way of establishing dramatic tension. Not that you could possibly care for these characters, as it is... even if his ex-g.f. was amply endowed.Anyhow, I could go on, but I've wasted enough of my life on this film. Yes, the two hours I've spent watching and then immediately typing out this stern warning is already too much. Fortunately, I didn't have to pay to rent it - it's on my digital cable movie package this month. Mind you, I think I would have demanded a refund of my rental money as well as the gas to get to and from the video store had I actually rented this tripe. Either that, or forced the video store clerks to WATCH this crap a la Malcolm McDowell in \"A Clockwork Orange\" - but that would have been just cruel. Really, the person who should have been forced to watch this in that fashion SHOULD be Uwe Boll, with a roomful of disgruntled moviegoers asking him every two seconds this pertinent question:\"WHAT WERE YOU THINKING??\"Yeesh.",

            "content": "...over this movie. Watching House of the Dead is like watching an Ed Wood movie, but without the enjoyment of pointing out the low production values.I just wanna say right now, that this movie was TERRIBLE! You could be a fan of poorly-made, low-budget zombie films, and STILL hate this movie.The movie had a lot going for it, and Uwe Boll, the director, had to go and mess it all up. What could have more potential than a movie about a bunch of unsupervised teenagers on an island? Not to mention, there's about a couple of thousand mindless zombies strolling around, perfect for target practice.House of the Dead is based off the arcade smash-hit of the same name. Needless to say, the game is much much better than the movie. The game even had better acting than the movie, and they were 3D models!The movie starts out like any other clich\u00e9 horror pic. A terribly acted voice-over tries to explain the main characters, but it's not really stated why they're significant, or where they came from. The guy, Rudy, does mention that one of the characters is his ex-girlfriend, and that she enjoys fencing for no reason at all. This is obviously just a set up to give an explanation to why she can sword fight in a future battle scene.Anyway, we find out that these unexplained characters are traveling to a remote island for \"the rave of the year!\" The actors are so bad, that they can't even play out their own vague personalities described by the horrid voice-over in the beginning. One of the guys was supposed to be notably stupid, but they all were. And like any horror film, every single person in the film is \"pretty\".After suffering through all the dialogue, the group ends up bribing the captain (whom is the only fairly cool character in this book and the only one that has the remotest of acting abilities.) to take them to the island. It was tough work too, because apparently, there seems to be some evil \"spirits\" on the island.The rest of the movie pretty much takes place on the island. A cut to the island shows pre-zombiefied ravers drinking beer, dancing, and doing' the dirty. And I think it goes without saying that there is, of course, shameless nudity galore. But that's pretty much it. There's a few cut-aways when the zombies start to attack, but nothing to keep you interested.The movie drags on and on, and the group from the beginning arrive at the island and find out it's deserted. Again, it goes on and on, and the group meets up with Rudy (That's the voice-over guy, remember him? Probably not, because, he never gets mentioned again until now.) Rudy and the other survivors are all locked up in an old house that is just magically there. They're safe in the house, but of course, they decide to leave and \"get help.\"At this point, the you're not interested any more. You came to see zombies, not 45 minutes of stupid teenagers talking and committing indecent acts. To amplify this feeling, I'll explain the rest of the movie with mumbles: *mumble* Group finds some guns from captain's ship. *mumble* The zombies attack (finally.) *mumble* Someone dies. *mumble* More zombies. *mumble* Someone else dies. *mumble* Giant fight scene that's featured in every trailer, (because it's the only enjoyable part of the movie.) *mumble* More people die.*mumble* Zombies are \"explained.\" (Not really. It's just some goofy story about a prisoner who makes a potion to live forever. It never is explained why and how the other people live forever too.) *mumble* Even more people die. *mumble*...I'd like to tell more about this movie, but there may be some hopeless chump out there reading this article that may actually want to see this movie still.Let me just say this now for you chumps: If you're a fan of low-budget, gory, bad, horrible films. This isn't one of them. It's a fairly high (24 million) budget, yet they still use digital blood in most of the scenes. DIGITAL! The gore doesn't look real at all. Half the movie looks like it was animated by Disney, and they do cartoons with talking animals in them.The camera angles are terrible as well. Cut-aways are used almost every minute, and I could've sworn I saw the same shot of running zombies thirteen times. I really think the director had a thing for slow-motion crab shots too. Pretty much every shot in the action sequences featured a character in the middle of the shot while the camera spun around them \"Matrix style\". Sometimes, the effect would start, but then there would be no pay-off at the end, it would just end. The camera would move over ten feet, and then just cut to another shot.The music wasn't anything special, as it was mostly mainstream rock music blared throughout every fight scene and underlayed with repetitive gunshots. The picture quality was also sub-par. It varied from Panavision niceness, to grainy, blurry, and over-exposed ugliness. Almost as if they shot the movie in consumer DV Cameras.To sum it all up, this movie is not worth the three bucks to rent it. It's not even worth the gas money you'd spend to drive to the video store. So please, do us all a favor Uwe, burn down the House that you brought us this 'Dead'ly film in.",

I happen to think its kind of refreshing to see that there are people still making throwaway movies like this. These are the Ed Woods of today!!Some highlights for me: Zombies coming out of the water, holding their breaths under water (as witnessed by the big puffy cheeks)and doing the big exhale as they surface...zombies, dead, as in not breathing. Get it?Highlight 2: Female heroine A (whatever her name is) finds an old book which turns out to be a centuries old Spanish ship's log. Which of course, she has translated and located all information pertinent to their plight within 90 seconds. Script Highlight: Hero (whatever his damn name is) \"You created it all so you could be immortal. Why?\" Villain: \"To live forever.\" Which kind of makes you think, if the hero asks \"Why?\" one more time, we may get caught in an infinite loop of \"To be immortal.\" \"Why?\" \"To live forever.\" \"Why?\"...

Lets just get the obvious problems out of the way: terrible plot, terrible acting, terrible dialouge, terrible directing editing cinematography and any other jobs in the film.But house of the dead manages to go beyond horrible filmmaking and make great progression in the field of bad film making. The first awful technique is the splicing in of footage from the game. This is to remind you of course that its a video game movie and thats why its terrible.\nThe second is the bullet time effect of spining the camera around the action. This teqnique is incredibly over used in many terrible points in the film. Often we cut to an actor shooting and the gun spins around them fast, as the speed of the action slows down. But at another point one of the actors throws an ax at a zombie and instead of tracking the ax we begin to circle around the actor after the ax already left her hands. As if watching her watch the ax fly is the interesting part.During almost all of the action the stunt object like jump pads and wires are painfully visible. Continuty errors are plentiful. The action is dull.This is a terrible film and would be considered bad for b movie except that this was released in theaters.",

Acting, quality, story ( wait a second...what story?!), and every other aspect of film seemed to be diminished to lowest possible level anyone could possibly think of.Five teenagers, request a boat trip over to the island cleverly known as \"Isla de Muerte\" or \"The Island of Death\"(by the way, that was sarcasm). When they arrived to the island where the party of the year is supposed to be located at, they find absolutely no one (what a surprise!).  The extremely smart teens think not too much of the disappearances before they are attacked by zombies that appear to be normal people with a little make up on (which they are!), and before you know it, they are in a situation of life and death in which seems to be more visible.  As you can see, this is a story you have never before seen.The film is supposed to be based on the video game by the same title, which I have to admit is wildly entertaining, but the movie highly lacks the same feeling.  It is so awful that you begin to laugh at the story and actions the people begin to take.  The captain holds his wet finger up to determine the appearance of a storm, the cop named Casper and her partner with the name McGuyver, and of course the pathetic zombies that appear to be lost on set, all add to this humor that I speak of.One of the incidents in the movie I thought was funniest is a moment where Greg is with Casper and they are suddenly attacked by a swarm of zombies. Casper, the armed one, tells Greg to run and save himself.  Of course Greg runs away and is chased by many zombies, and in the end doesn't make it ( If you think I spoiled a part of the plot, I didn't.  You find out who dies within the first five minutes of the movie.).  Casper returns to the group and is asked about Greg and she can only respond with \"He didn't make it.\" If Greg had just stayed with the person who had the gun, he would have lived like she did.  Then you begin to realize that she must have just sent him away to take the zombies away from her.  This is what happens after you watch the movie.  You try to make more sense than there actually is.  You try to make it more clever and simply hope that people couldn't have made a movie as bad as it is!Whatever you do, do not wastes 90 minutes of your life on this film in which your IQ will literally drop as you watch it.",

This is by a long shot not the best movie I've ever seen. But it gave me one and a half hour of entertainment, which was what I expected from It.

The action sequences and camera work during them were pretty nifty, and the video game footage interspersed was a novel idea. The acting and dialog, while on the surface seem wooden, may actually be an attempt to shadow what happens in a game- with characters saying things that would seem stupid in a real life situation, but are exactly the kinds of things you expect to hear from video game characters (\"Guys, check out this book. Looks pretty old, maybe it'll help us!\"). A lot of the camera work and in particular the work during and after the death scenes also drive the point home that yes, this movie is based on the concept of a game. In terms of upholding the cheesy horror movie tradition this film does fairly well, with plenty of pointless female nudity, plenty of over the top gore and plenty of lame dialog (whether intended or not). Definitely a movie to avoid if you don't have an appreciation for B-grade flicks, but for those of us who love our horror as bad as it gets, don't go passing this one up.",

You have to take movies in the context of their goals, audience, and subject. You can't rate a Jason movie on the same scale your rating say, Amelie. Jason X was meant to be a funny, fun, slasher sequel and thats exactly what it was. It was truly entertaning and met its goals as its particular genre of film perfectly.That said, House of the Dead was an eagerly anticipated 'fun' film for me. I knew it would be bad in the same vein Jason X is bad, that is, so bad it would be nothing but awesome. A few early reviews lead me to beleive this. So corny and stupid that it would be really fun to watch. Unfortunetly that was not the case :(.From start to finish this movie was a 40 million dollar peice of garbage. The script was unbarely stupid (in a bad way), the jokes were very stale and pointless, the acting horrible for even a B-Movie, and most of all, the execution on the directory's part was so ass-backwards one had to sit there slack-jawed in disbeleif. Clips from the video game were inserted randomly throughout the movie (yeah we know its based on the video game, we don't actually have to see the stupid video clips to get that point and draw us out of the movie every 10 minutes) and most of the matrix-esque effects (which could have been a laughably great part of the film) were inserted in the most pointless places and used in excess to the point of stupidity.\nThis movie had SO MUCH POTENTIAL. I was expecting to love it in all its cheesy glory but no. It was butchered horribly. This movie is not awesomely bad, its not even bad, its just plain horrible. I was honestly sick to my stomache after watching it. You'll probably end up seeing it (thats why your reading this review), but I plead with you to wait till it comes out on video, which will no doubt be soon since it will definetly bomb in the box office, and don't support this movie with your 8.50$. Watch Kill Bill instead, its well worth the money. Or 28 days later, thats a good zombie film.I would honestly like to slap everyone in the face who was involved with the production of this movie. 2/10",

            "content": "You may be unfamiliar with director Uwe Boll. He is a small-time German director that is only now breaking ever so slowly into the recognised world of cinema. His past credits are unspeakable pieces of trash, and he looks to have no intention of reinventing himself. House of the Dead is Boll's first attempt at American success. Based on a mildly popular video game series, the movie was intended to be a fast paced horror romp, with servings of gore, sex and effects driven action. And as you watch it, you may think, where did Boll go wrong?Well, it may be easier if you ask: Where didn't he go wrong? Everything that was attempted in this movie turns out to be a complete failure. Take the storyline, for example. House of the Dead's plot revolves around 4 party-goers in what seems to be their late 20s arriving at an ravaged island where the party of a lifetime was supposed to be taking place. OK, this party is basically around 40 people in the middle of what looks to be a Canadian pine forest, overlooking one of the murkiest, horrible looking beaches I've ever seen. Evil deeds ensue, and before you know it, that girl that was just flashing her t*** just got tackled by a horde of men draped in grey rags with red lights for eyes. And how's this for a great plot development. Our sole victoring hero is none other than a character we meet at least 40 minutes into the film. All of the original characters we were supposed to become attached to die, making the first act of the movie utterly useless. OK, to be fair, one of the original characters lives. Even though she plain got stabbed through her cleavage, shattering her chest plate and surely puncturing her heart, she lives. Obviously the writers never heard of anything called a medical journal. When you have a character living, limping and standing upright after having a sword impaled into her heart, you know you've got a bad movie on your hands.I should also mention the screenplay. This has to be the biggest piece of vile **** I have ever witnessed. Such classic lines like \"That's Spanish..... in case you don't speak Mexican\" and \"Why do I want to be immortal? TO LIVE FOREVER!\" Unless the writers took a really unhealthy dump on a piece of paper and started writing the screenplay in it with their fingers, they aren't successfully capturing the essence of the script.And whomever it was that came up with the 'heart pounding' action sequences, I'm sure they had personal ambitions to make this movie sink lower than any movie before it. Imagine a lengthy battle scene containing gun wielding college students with extensive firearm training, against nonthreatening zombie-like minions that don't do terribly much. Couple this with over 15 instances of long bullet time moments, transitions of awful, grainy video game footage and some strange 'fly around character and fade to red' effect that I safely predict won't become the next horror movie trend. I must admit, the main action sequence is a brave step. Boll tried many new things, many old things and many many bad things. But even the bravest of people end up dead, or in this case, broke.Take it from me, this movie just plain reeks. In fact, it could even be passed off as a movie made purposely bad. I've only touched on some of the major flaws that exist in the film, as some are too tormenting to relive. All in all, House of the Dead is one of the better examples of how far a movie can miss it's mark. It goes from bad, to funny bad, to the one of the worst films ever.... in the first 20 seconds. But please, don't let that discourage you. After all, this is probably Uwe Boll's finest hour.1.5/10",

The problem is the house was about 4 rooms big and was only explored during the last portion of the film.   The plot was very thin and lacked any detail, for characters or for a setting. Even the starring villian, the main zombie, was left highly undeveloped. However, the film did teach me that if I am stuck in a life and death situation, I too will possess martial arts skills and highly accurate marksmanship.  The use of \"bullet time\" camera effects was highly over used. The video game footage cut scenes were too and the character deaths were just plain...stupid.  To sum it up, horrible plot and acting...sounds like this one might be a cult classic in the future (unfortunately).",

            "content": "****SPLOILER I recently saw this movie on DVD and it easily ranks as one of the top 5 worst movies I ever saw along with Gymkata(a classic) and Virus. When I decided to rent this I was looking for a bloody gore/action movie because I was in the mood for that type of movie. I had stumbled across this \"gem\" in Blockbuster and remembered the trailer after picking it up and decided what the heck I'll watch it. It's funny because it said, \"based on a video game\" on the back and I couldn't remember what video game they were talking about. Well trust me you find out in the movie because they actually flash clips from the video game in the movie. The first time I saw that, I thought I was imaging things because I couldn't believe my eyes, I actually rewinded it not once but TWICE because the clip had NO BUSINESS being in that part of the movie. But as the movie progresses this becomes a very common occurrence. Anyway the plot of this movie is hilarious. The group of kids shows up to a rave on an island to find the \"rave\" abandoned. I put rave in quotes because when you see this party it looks like one of those parties from sixth grade where the girls and guys act all awkward towards one another and nobody knows how to dance. There is even a volleyball net set up with people playing volleyball to complete the stupidity of calling it a rave. Anyway the group missed the boat to the rave by 15 minutes so they pay Captain Kirk (I'm not joking) and his quasi-gay Igor like henchman Salish (Clint Howard) to take them there only to find the no one there. I loved how the zombies basically kill everyone on the island, yet when these morons show up they walk all over the island with no incident until meeting up with the remaining survivor.  The zombie's attack, yadayadayada it gets so dumb that its funny that is what is important. I also love how in these types of movies, everyone suddenly knows how to use a gun like a freaking expert marksman. Oh well, I should have seen this coming from the moment I rented this one. After all, when Clint Howard is your big name star, you know you're in trouble. Another hilarious aspect of this movie was the 360 degree close ups of each character firing their \"trademark\" weapon. If you watch carefully its even funnier cause they aren't even firing at anything. The inserting of the video game clips was original, yet it also unintelligent.  What I fear is that this director opened a Pandora's Box with this move, enticing other directors out there to do the same such thing in their movies. Somewhere out there, some director will think its a good idea and copy it. Its bound to happen, it always does. But for a really good laugh watch the footage of the main actresses preparing for the role in the movie. I swear it's priceless. In seriousness I give this movie a zero, but for unintentional comedy purposes Id have to give it a 7, maybe an 8 if you watch it in a certain state of mind.",

If any one is reading this and thought Blair Witch 2 was the worst horror movie ever, guess again!  Don't waste any money renting this movie!  The plot revolves, much like the video game, around a group of young people traveling to a \"cursed\" island.  When the group reaches the island they find that all the party-goers have dissapeared and soon find themselves fighting off the most poorly constructed zombies of all time.  People watching this movie in 1950 would probably have complained about how lame the special effects are. The plot is worse than that of BW 2 and to top it all off the frequently flash to scenes, from the video game, of zombies being shot.  The only thing scarier than this movie is the thought of having to watch it again.",

Save your money and drink tequila instead - the headache afterwards will be better than watching this movie.

Every time the ravers get a hold of a gun, all turn into Starship Troopers. We also learn that one raver is bestowed with the power to commit a selfless act of bravery as he dies. Its good to point out here that it was the most selfish raver of them all, how poetic. Maybe ravers from were Uwe Boll is from are like that,who knows? Not five minutes after the Asian raver girl is introduced she has a full out kung fu fight with a zombie(stereotype by the way).I don't want to be picky, but since when can zombies swim,run, and jump off of mini trampolines. I was expecting for the ravers to start getting picked off by a sniper zombie. How convenient is it that the captain just so happens to be the biggest arms dealer on the east coast. I was surprised it didn't say \"reload\" on the side of the screen...oh wait...it did say it. Wow Boll, was it your idea to put clips from the game in the movie? That is single-handedly the WORST idea ever. I guarantee 80% of the budget went into ten seconds of the film which consists of some bullet-time(which makes it look like the camera is broken) and the cgi of three bullets. If i made a movie with a bunch of old Ninja Turtles action figures and my 1985 huge-ass camcorder, I would end up with better cinematography,acting,story etc. The acting/writing, was atrocious. In one particular scene a guy falls asleep ten seconds after watching his girlfriend start swimming naked in the water.Now lets talk about zombies, I swear on everything that's good on earth I saw an old lady with long hair and no make-up on just walking among the zombies.Right after her introduction, one of the ravers finds her the most threatening and unloads half a clip into her head.The only reason you should maybe download the second half of this movie for FREE is the scene were a zombie sticks his head up from behind a log and it gets instantaneously blown up by the cop(who's name is casper and whoshould be black listed in Hollywood for the worst act job ever bar none). Also that one of the early pointless girl characters that gets naked looks like Fiona from Eurotrip.Uwe Boll needs to be fired...wait no...he should be descended upon with the fury of the four horsemen of the apocalypse. This is a call to arms for all film watchers. Write letters, begin message boards, if you ever come across Uwe,give him a good kick in the bolls. Do everything in your power to not let this disaster ever happen again. Your help is needed now more than ever as he isslated to direct three more video game to movie adaptations as we speak. P.S. I still can't believe it ended in a sword fight between two ravers and the Spanish madman zombie king",

I took a sickie off from work and took a trip to the video store to see if I could find a zombie movie to pass the time.\"Oh, House of the Dead, huh? Yeah why not?\" Now I know why not.OK, so the basic story is that a group of teenagers want to go to the \"rave of the century\" that's set on the island of death. They miss the main ferry and bribe Jurgen Prochnow and his cheesy sidekick Clint Howard (\"It's eeeeevil!\") to take them to the island (with Clint Howard getting flashed some rack on the way).They get there are find the rave to be deserted.So what do they do at a deserted rave of the century that's abandoned and only about the size of my backyard? Why, half of them start partying, and the other half have a look around to figure out what's going on.It's gets dark quickly and a couple that decided to stay start making out, but the guy decides he needs to take a leak first. This is when the chick get attacked.I don't think it's coincidence that it's at this point when a character goes to the toilet, that this film also goes down the toilet with the full flush button held down.During the film, and throughout, short clips from the HOTD game are spliced into the film for no reason. Maybe to just remind us that it's a remake of the game, b/c otherwise you really wouldn't know.The group meet up again (minus the attacked chick) and look around some more. They find a house. They go in and find other \"partygoers\" complaining that the \"rave of the century\" was, like, totally trashed and stuff, man.By this time, the group includes an Asian chick in a stars and stripes skin tight outfit called Liberty (yes you read right), a George A Romero fan (shameless attempt at film street-credibility here), an underwear model, Ona Grauer and her ample chest, a coast guard armed to the teeth (why not?) and some other people I don't care about.After travelling to the wharf to find the \"Boat that wasn't there\" (3rd favourite line in the film) to escape the island, zombies with bad make up attack!!! Liberty gets molested by one of them, but no worries, Jurgen Prochnow guns down all bad make up zombies and all is good again.He even shows them a stash of guns he was smuggling and the group gets armed and dangerous.So they journey back to the aforementioned house which is surrounded by zombies.Now here is where it gets flat out stupid. They start gunning down the zombies in bullet time and Liberty suddenly discovers she knows Kung Fu.This whole action sequence is annoying and the laws of physics fly out the window. None of the ravers miss a single shot (even though it's the first time any have used a gun), and as I said with Liberty, they all all-of-a-sudden know Kung Fu.It's obvious that many of the zombies here were the same zombies gunned down before. Also, some of these zombies are ninjas. Classy.Oh, Liberty dies while another guy looks on with a montage playing and the editing guy loving his job too much.They finally make it to the house.They barricade the door and my second favourite line in the movies emerges. Upon the underwear model finding an old book, he says \"Hey, this book is really old. Maybe it can help us.\" Script, glorious script!! Yep, that full flush button is still being held down\u0085 Some drama unfolds when one of the chicks says she thinks the underwear model is still attractive even though half of his face is covered in bad \"I got acid-burnt\" make up.Jurgen Prochnow is dying at this point so he logically concludes he should venture outside and blow himself and the front door up. So the zombies storm in, and the party retreat deeper into the house. But not before underwear man does the typical-stand-around-and-hesitate-when-yelled-at-to-move routine and gets attacked and blows himself up too.The party is reduced to 3 at this point and the venture deeper into the bowels of house. After having used up all their ammo before, an absence of bullets doesn't stop them from shooting more zombies anyway, but another chick dies in a pointless \"Don't worry I'll handle them!!\" scene.Ona Grauer and her ex boyfriend remain at this point and push on.They stumble into the lair of the main bad guy, and he tells them about his plan to reanimate the dead to achieve immortality. Hence is presented my favourite quote of the film when asked why he wants to be immortal: \"To live forever\" he says.Oh, Joyous script!! Anyway, they fight and an explosion goes off.Here is the only redeeming part of this film. Ona Grauer runs outside and you get a nice slow mo of her fun-bags bouncing around while she dives away with her bf.Ona is stabbed and the bf survives after a useless sword fight with the bad guy.And the movie finally ends.The only way to enjoy this film is to have subterranean expectations and switch your brain off. Abysmal script, toilet-esquire acting (they look like they were reading cue cards as they went), rubbishy action and plot holes aplenty.This film could maybe be fun it if was a spoof, but Uwe Boll takes himself seriously and thinks really he's a genuinely good filmmaker.

It was one of those movies that I rented where I went to the kitchen and made a sandwich, then I talked on the phone, then I drove to the corner store for some cigars, and I never pushed pause once.",

After buying the popcorn and drinks and inviting your friends 'round for a \"great night of horror!\" you turn the DVD on. Now instead of the movie you thought you were going to watch, you were attacked by an exploding fetus with needles, you would still gain better value for money than watching any Uwe Boll movie in existence.The human language has over 250 000 words in existence, yet none of them would provide an adequate description for just how bad this movie is. Just by viewing the sheer stupidity of the script and the horrendous acting involved, you're killing your brain, and quite possibly your sperm.You see, Uwe Boll adds a special ingredient to his movies, that when watched, your eyes absorb a chemical emitted by the film that makes it's way through your body, to wage war on your sperm. Okay, I'm just kidding with you.Now, back to business. Much like the Abskani in Alone in the Dark, the Zombies in this suck. For example, in one scene, where the \"heroes\" of the story are making their way through a graveyard of some sort (yes, I know. They're being attacked by Zombies, but still insist on taking a midnight stroll through a graveyard), they are ambushed by hundreds of zombies, each carrying axes or some kind of weapon. Now, as ridiculous as that may sound, you're in for more. In a sort of tribute to the video game, the scene pauses on each actor and does a 360 camera spin around them in slow motion. What point this serves to the plot, I don't know. And in a further disassociation of reality, a zombie, have decayed, runs, yes runs, full speed and then, hand in hand with stupidity, does a forward flip and launches an axe towards the actress. Yeah, I lol'ed.Now I could go on and on all day about just how bad this movie is, and how much I hate Uwe Boll, and how surprised I was to learn he has a doctorate in literature, but I can't due to time constraints.In conclusion, House of the Dead is as connected to the original video game as Jesus H. Christ is Scientology. If you're looking for a cheap laugh then by all means, watch it. However, you'll regret doing so afterward.",

This was so terrible I couldn't believe it. All of the reviews on here that I have read don't even give it justice. It is so bad that you can't even write a review bad enough to justify it. Everything that could go wrong in a movie has gone wrong here. The acting and story, or lack there of, were horrible. The Director should be shot.

I can not believe this was made. The best parts of the movie were the video game sequences (sarcasm). Who decided to throw those in? They should be banned from movies forever.

Second the actors, they were so bad, it was like the porn actor without any soul in their performance. Third the dialogues were so lame; the writer was like 16 years old. Forth the makeup was so fake; you almost see the glue in the injuries. Sixth the edition was horrible; at one moment the character has a gun and the next a knife and the next it is just running, I think the editor was blind or something and was editing with sound effect.

They abuse with this camera, they use everything with this angle, when someone was walking, Boom the gyratory camera!, when somebody shot guns, Boom the gyratory camera!, when somebody die, Boom the gyratory camera!

The game story was interesting enough and, after all, there were zombies and creepy creatures on it!! I must admit I didn't expect this movie to be outstanding, but neither did I expect to be like this. Sometimes we complaint about movies without being objective, because we didn't like this or that, and other viewers can think different. This is the one movie where this rule doesn't apply. The movie sucks, it has no plot (even the game had a better plot, and you were shooting things 99% of the time), the jokes are not funny, the actors seem retarded, but the worst is that for the first time in my life this movie gave me the impression that the director was insulting me and my intelligence (I don't know how to explain it in other way). It seems like the guy is laughing his ass off in front of all the fans of the game (if any) and all the people who paid something to see his \"work\".Don't get me wrong, I'm a fan of horror movies, and I'm accustomed to bad movies (in fact there are few good horror movies out there) but this one crosses the line of RESPECT towards the viewer. Other directors at least tried to do something right, this man tried to do everything wrong and insulting, and I must admit he excelled at it.Many of you might guess (correctly) that English is not my home language, and I apologize for the mistakes, but Im taking the burden so at least one person can avoid wasting money and (especially) time on this (spanish) \"mierda\" :).",

That pretty much sets the tone of the entire movie.I'm sure the credits say differently, but it seems like most of this movie was written by a group of 14-year-old boys with mild learning disabilities.Why does a group of twenty-somethings with no apparent martial arts training (exception noted below) have the combat skills to fend off dozens of attackers, many of them armed? When they come across a convenient cache of firearms, why are they able to accurately shoot moving, leaping targets? In some recent zombie movies, the monsters are faster and more agile. In House of the Dead, it's fairly obvious that the \"zombies\" are just stunt men with a few pounds of latex makeup caked on their faces. Do the stunt men know they're portraying zombies, or are they just jogging after the protagonists? Why do all the sets look like they were recycled from an amusement park ride? Why does the only Asian-American character seem to have superior martial arts abilities? Why does the only black character sacrifice herself to save the white protagonists? Sometimes bad costuming and makeup can be excused if it's only shown briefly, or from a distance. Here, we're treated to repeated closeups of makeup that resembles the kind you'd see on those $1.99 greasepaint kits the supermarket sells around Halloween. We're shown extreme closeups of fake chain mail that's obviously sequined cloth. And the camera lingers on it for ten, fifteen seconds.Speaking of makeup and costuming, it's good to know that your hair will still look good after savage gun battles and strenuous hand-to-hand combat.And why are they flashing shots of actual video game footage during the movie? Couldn't they just flash an image of a guy throwing away eight bucks? I kept having Torgo flashbacks whenever they showed that bearded fisherman in the yellow rain slicker. While no attempt was made at character development -- or any kind of characterization for that matter -- having this guy in the movie was particularly bad.Technically, I don't think this is really a movie: it's more of a delivery device for action, special effects and brief nudity.",

Folks, if it's one deciding factor that has you teetering between the delicate balance between respecting Uwe Boll's efforts to create cinematic masterpieces, and totally wanting to punch him in the face for bastardizing what would otherwise be a PERFECTLY FINE VIDEO GAME ON ITS OWN, seeing this movie will have you sliding down the former because hell if I didn't want to deck the guy after seeing this.You can tell a movie is bad when the beginning narration comes from a dead guy. I wish I could remember the first line of dialog when the movie began, but it was just so corny and stupid I'd be surprised if anyone hasn't suppressed it into the deepest corner of their memory. Besides the crummy dialog though, which continues to get more awkward and overplayed by equally crummy actors--oh, wait. That's where I was going next with this review. Yeah, the actors all kind of suck in their own right, however, I can't say I really blame them. Imagine being asked to cast in one of Uwe Boll's movies and being desperate and poor enough you ACTUALLY have to do so. I feel bad for them all, really. Well, except for the guy that played the fisherman's annoying boat boy. Man, I hated that guy. His acting is some of the worst that you will ever see in the face of acting history, and that's kind of saying a lot since his role is pretty minor.Anyway, as far as the plot and script or lack thereof goes, you're pretty much better off imagining there was none in the first place, since the given script and plot makes absolutely no sense and would be completely--and, pardon what I'm about to say here, I mean no offense to those who actually suffer mental deficiencies--retarded even if it did. From what I could gather from it, the movie was about some 40 year olds wishing they were still in their 20's wanting to travel to obscure island in the middle of nowhere to go to some lame rave that, for whatever reason, takes place in the middle of the day. Insert actor guy #1, who is supposed to be the suave, collected jerk of the group given that he has the most hideous blonde bimbo attached to his arm like a leech, blabbering on about how much money he has. He talks to some captain about taking his boat to this island which supposedly has some weird voodoo going on about it. Insert a blur of crappy acting, droning dialog, and whatever else you see fit here. The kids go the island, something-something happens, then zombies appear. Like the typical zombie, they are hungry for living people, and so they chase after the kids in their $10 wal-mart costumes and pretend to be scary for a while.I don't like talking about the movie because it makes me remember how much I wanted to kill myself throughout watching most of it. It was terrible. Even if you're a connoisseur of crappy movies and buy these kind of films for twisted entertainment, believe me House of the Dead is NOT worth adding to your collection by any means.

I somehow managed to sit thru it's entirety, I guess it was kind of like a train wreck, you know you shouldn't watch but you can't turn away. The horrible action sequences actually used clips from the game, there was WAY too much use of stop motion 360 degree matrix style cinematics, and the dialogue was the worst I've ever heard. Characters that \"wish they were Foxy Brown\" or being named Liberty and wearing a gaudy stars and stripes motif Lycra suit, naming them CPT Kirk?!?! Everyone becomes instant kung fu masters the moment they're pursued by the incredibly fast and agile \"undead\", then become expert sharpshooters and professional soldiers when CPT Kirk open his case full of guns. At which point there a dialogue exchange of \"we don't have any food or guns\" to which CPT Kirk replied \"\"we do now\" then opened his box containing about 1 gun a couple flares and some random rounds of ammunition. Apparently the rest were invisible in the box because everyone had at least 2 guns the next time you see them. It was like a clown car only a gun box, things just kept coming out of it. I could go on but I'm getting sick again seeing the movie in my head.The fact that Uwe Boll is allowed to make films both astonishes and disgusts me. Anyone who would use fast action clips from a game released by Sega in 1996 to make a film in 2003 needs to have their head examined. So does anyone who would finance that person. I feel sorry for anyone that saw this movie and feel even sorrier for the cast, because after this bomb they were no doubt unable to find work.I guess Uwe Boll put out some kind of challenge where he would fight his critics. If I have to fight him to stop him from ever making another film, I'd consider it my service to the world. I'd rather challenge him to make something that doesn't make me violently ill, or at least something an elementary school AV club couldn't outproduce.If you want to see this I suggest to panhandle for some change and rent it so you don't actually spend your money.

Don't buy the DVD, don't play it on the boob (you'll be the boob). And bloody hell, I LOVE ZOMBIE MOVIES. But this? This is toxic waste, toxic, stinking excrement.",

The thought of the other people paying $13 each to watch this dog while they coulda picked a few other perfectly respectable films made me so full of mirth I couldn't stop laughing throughout the whole film. This is not just mere laughter at the bad parts, but crazy assed hurting my sides, friends moving away from me because they're so embarrassed, infecting other watchers with my laughter.. laughter! I think my laughter actually helped people enjoy the film more.. seriously.If you can truly enjoy a bad film.. at how much effort, money, and time was spent on this film by countless people.. at how somebody seriously thought this was a good idea.. whatever.. then this is a jewel. THE WORST FILM I'VE EVER SAW. and i've never laughed so hard in my life. the fact that it was filmed in Vancouver (my hometown) made it even better (and at the same time worse and more embarrassing).",

The best recommendation I can give for this movie is that if you love to watch a movie that makes you laugh at its ridiculous plots and scenes, you will love this movie like I do. You will never think it is a great film, because as everyone who has seen this movie knows, it is not, but it is terribly funny. Awfully funny. After seeing this, everyone I knew was mad at me for making them see it. It is that terrible. Keep watching Uwe Boll, for he will surely continue to put out terrible video game movies that make me laugh and wish i could make celluloid spontaneously combust.",

At the same time, the CEO's must have been crying themselves to sleep over why they gave their money to this dumb German.

To be honest with you... that's about as far as the plot goes. The acting in this film is dire. It is full of poor one liners and cheesy lines. So many flaws: OK, these students get a lift with a fisherman who is wanted by this cop woman for smuggling weapons - SMUGGLING WEAPONS! He had 3 wooden boxes each with 1 gun in! They were going to what was supposed to be the biggest rave of the century - there looked like there was about 12 people there - I've had bigger garden parties!Before I saw this movie someone said to me - it's dawn of the dead meets The Matrix - how I laughed. The reference to the matrix is bullet time - really bad bullet time at that, and the reference to Dawn of the Dead is dead people. This movie had lots of killing of dead people - the fighting scenes were so messy - they were just a series of close ups all muddled up with some bullet time thrown in.I have a UGC Unlimited card so was not too riled by the fact that I saw this film however, I feel sorry for any paying cinema goer who paid six English pounds to see this drivel!",

Clint Howard was excellent as usual.I'm not going to get into the story, but once it picks up,  It's a Gorefest in overdrive. Think Matrix meets Dawn of the Dead. The splatter FX were good.

Two games I would say are the some of the most fun to play light-gun games IF you have a light-gun to play them with (do not bother playing with gamepad, mouse or keyboard, trust me, I have tried). So despite the games having flaws such as bad graphics, minimalist story (there only for backdrop to the game), and really bad translations of the characters lines (f.ex. \"Don't come!\" when a girl is approached by a zombie), the lines are so bad some of them become really funny (unlike the movie). But amid all this the game was actually FUN to play, you know FUN? Like games are supposed to be. So a game is not like a movie, a game is supposed to be fun to play and does not need a story, it merely needs to be fun to play with, plots are unnecessary really.I was genuinely surprised when I heard of this movie, since the game series it was based on had almost no story to speak of, I mean the basic plot from the game was just loosely this: (this is from the game, not the movie, so no spoilers, sorry) You, a type of investigator/cop (It's and your partner are sent out to some town, you see zombies, you save some people, evil scientist and later evil dictator-type makes zombies using green stuff, you save the day. End plot. I really did not think one could make a movie with so little to base it on, so I was exited to be able to see how it would come out...I CAN NO LONGER PLAY THE GAME!!! Because it reminds me of the movie.This movie was so.. horrible that it hurts trying to think about it.The worst part is that I can not pinpoint what really made it so bad. The acting is mediocre, but i have loved films with worse acting. The scenery/props is/are nice and leaves no negative remarks visually (the style/condition of some of the props on tables remind me of Evil Dead for some reason). The location has NOTHING to do with the games. The characters are even less likable then the ones from the game. The plot is altered for the worse.

Perhaps just to see how many people were walking out... or perhaps just to help out those who were trying to leave... get out. Not only did the storyline bite chunky pancake dough... but the \"actors\" just weren't acting. The very first line in the movie kills it for everybody in the theater. You are NOT supposed to start a movie off by having a guy say \"If only they wouldn't have come... they would still be alive\"... You just don't say that. Sega... how could you?  You've made absolute fools of yourselves (Sega seemed to have sponsored the \"Rave of the Year\" where this whole thing took place).  And if you're going to make a movie based off a game.. please.. pleaaaaaaaaaase... don't use clips from the game within the movie. And if you're going to use bullet time... don't use it for more than a total minutes of 30 seconds in a fight scene. The only reason I can possibly think of for this movie being so insipidly stupid... was that they were trying to get the most mistakes for moviemistakes.com on opening weekend. One scene that really stood out was near the end. If you watch carefully, when the two 'survivors' are running out of the underground cave lab thing ... it's day... when the lab blows up a second later... it's night... when they show the two characters talking after that.. it's still night... but then when the evil dude comes running out after them.. it's day again. I've seen bad movies.. and I must say, this is the WORST movie I've ever seen. I knew something was wrong when the opening credits involved a Photoshop'ed (chopped? After Effects? nah.. most probably Videowave...) series of clips from the game itself. The only good thing about the entire movie were the boobie shots... and maybe the few little jokes that were \"hidden\" in the dialogue (dude to chick: \"It looks like it's gonna rain.. we'd better get inside before we get wet\" girl:\"Too late...\") Just.. don't watch it.. if you absolutely must watch a bad b-movie... watch House of a 1000 Corpses... atleast that one has a really nice execution scene.  As I understand... Alone in the Dark is being made by this same company.  Let's just hope it's not as bad as House of the Dead.

(You know, all those Spanish islands off the coast of Seattle) Girls find themselves in situations where they are required to remove their shirts and bras and then bounce around, which may be the only redeeming quality of this movie if you're a male or a lesbian. Apparently you can also tell if it's going to storm by sticking your finger in your mouth and holding it in the air. Anyway, zombies bust up the rave, a plethora of weapons conveniently appear, and what feels like a half hour long matrix-y action scene set to repeating techno music goes on until I'm barely even paying attention anymore. Flashbacks to scenes hundreds of years ago are in grainy, sepia tone, as though they were supposed to have actually been filmed using old fashioned cameras, although it would have been about two hundred years before cameras were even invented. Screen shots of the video game appear once every ten minutes or so, which is distracting and annoying. Painfully predictable. My roommate and I were dictating everything that was going to happen twenty minutes before it happened. Great for a laugh.",

            "content": "Synopsis :- A group of happy-go-lucky teenagers head out to a remote island in the middle of nowhere for the ultimate rave party. Arriving too late to catch their arranged boat ride, they quickly search the harbor for someone else to take them. Stumbling upon a couple of rouge smugglers, they buy themselves a trip to the party \u0085 little realising it's gonna be one way! Once on the island they begin what they hope will be one of the best nights of their young lives \u0085 little realising IT WILL BE THEIR LAST!!! Mwah Mwah Mwah hahaha! Etc etc \u0085 As the audience, you sit there waiting patiently for a good film to unfold before your eyes, little realising \u0085Review :- You know when you see something so terrible, that even though you know you should look away, you can't stop looking? Cause it's so God-damn-awful!? This is one of those kinds of films. House Of The Dead is simply put \u0096 dreadful. It's the movie equivalent of a road wreck \u0085 only with more blood and less brains. If I were American I would exclaim 'Dude, this totally sucks ass', for it does and it truly is \u0085 awful. It joins 'The Principles Of Lust' & 'Catwoman' in my Top 3 Worst Films Of 2004. And here's why :- it sucks on every level imaginable \u0085 dude!It's not just the bad acting, horrid characters who annoy right from the start, ropey effects, zombies looking like they escaped from Michael Jackson's 'Thriller' video in 1983 \u0085 and are still on the run. It's not even the stupid plotting which includes such dumb-ass moments as the only survivor of the film telling you that everyone else is dead in the opening 30 seconds (which means a you don't give a flying fungal seed about any of them, cause they're all annoying and you already know they all die \u0085 it's just a question of how and when, not if, so by default there is absolutely no suspense whatsoever). It's all of those + things such as lame inserts of the computer game the film is based on! Oh yeah, computer graphics look really cool up on a 30 foot screen \u0085 not!. Then there's another sequence which sees the kids go to the house where the dead come from, then later on when those who are left are running for their lives, where do they decide to hide and hold their ground? Down by the harbor in case help arrives? The far side of the island where there's no zombie infestation? Hell, the hill in the centre of the island where you can at least see all around you and defend from all sides?No \u0085 these dumb American stereotypes, which you don't give a crap about anyway, go straight to the house \u0085 THE HOUSE!!!!! Knowing full well the creatures are inside and the bloody things came from there in the first place! How dumb do the film-makers think the audience is? If it was done tongue-in-cheek, then I could forgive it, but it doesn't. The film takes itself waaaay too seriously and thinks it's a proper full-on action/horror. But it's not. But cue lots of shooting and mayhem in the most ludicrous (and overlong) action sequence of the year anyway. Stealing from The Matrix and every zombie flick you can think of (The poster screams the tag-line 'It's The Matrix Meets Dawn Of The Dead' \u0085 well it certainly steals from both and subsequently urinates over the legacy of both!), the group of scared teenagers suddenly discover they can shoot firearms as though they'd all done a ten-year tour of duty in 'NAM, and a couple of them (who'd been kacking their pants earlier in the film) are suddenly capable of martial arts moves that would make Bruce Lee think twice before tackling them. It is one of the most over-long, drawn out, boring action sequences ever committed to celluloid. You will laugh yourselves silly at the over-use of bullet-time (funnily enough it's the same tracking shot used each time!) as EACH character has their own 'Matrix' moment \u0085 the damn thing goes on for about 15 minutes and it's soooooo dull!Now, I am one for suspending disbelief but please even in horror movies there are certain rules. The one crucial ingredient missing from this film is FUN! With such a silly set-up it needs a sense of humour. But the cast all play it dead straight and because not one of them seems to have even graduated past The Junior School of Stage Pantomime Acting, none of them have the acting chops to make it work. You will cringe at the scenes when any of them try anything remotely emotional. In one particular scene one of the main characters watches in horror as his now zombie-fied girlfriend gets blasted twice with a shotgun \u0085 all he can do to show his grief is slap his forehead like Homer Simpson and bite his lip! Seconds later he's running around as though nothing had happened \u0085 oh yeah I feel your pain \u0085 pillock! When are you gonna die? Soon I hope.And the story \u0085 of yeah, well the story \u0096 there isn't one! It's just set-up, set-up, lots of running, death and a crappy voice-over ending, which God forbid, hints at a sequel. This is a truly appalling film - from start to finish it's an atrocity to movie-making. I wanted to walk out on numerous occasions during its short (yet feels painfully very long) running time. It makes 'Resident Evil : APOCALYPSE' look like 'Citizen Kane'. Please kill this wanna-be Resi-clone now and be done with it. Basing a film on a LIGHT-GUN game was a bad idea in the first place, but then to jettison the plot and storyline in favour of this load of nonsense shows the film-makers as the idiots they are. I've been informed that the games have a really good story to them, none of that is evident here. Absolute tosh, avoid this like a sailor with the clap.",

To start out I'll break down why this movie stunk as both.As a Zombie film - the film lacked gore the zombies although they were fast and able to handle weapons were dumb throughout the film you see them an arms length away and not attempting to react( it almost seemed like they were on a smoke break). Also this movie was not scary the typical jump moments that you expect in horror films is not there. and then there is the camera work and editing many times the characters will be holding one weapon and when they change camera angles there is a totally different weapon.As a video game film - the original house of the dead story was a great concept in gaming that could have possibly made a good movie. This movie, even though called house of the dead share's nothing with game except the title. There is also the constant flashes to the game during the movie as if to fill up space.So if you are looking for a good zombie film rent Night of the living dead, Dawn of the Dead or Day of the Dead. You want a good video game movie rent Mortal Kombat and if you want a good Video Game/Zombie movie rent Resident Evil but don't ever watch 'house of the dumb'.",

I sure hope that ending doesn't indicate that they're going to have a follow-up in this selection. Thinking back to the most recent remake of \"Night of the Living Dead\", \"House of the Dead\" would undoubtedly score a zero, and what's worse is that Michael Jackson's \"Thriller\" was a more believable zombie flick than this movie :O",

They are then attacked by the world's lamest zombies, and fight them off using concentrated stupidity and bullet-time. Then there's a vampire pirate and a helicopter.People will try to justify this as a \"Fun B Movie\", \"Something you aren't meant to take seriously\" and that you should \"Just turn your brain off and enjoy it\".Despite the fact opinions are subjective and thus cannot be right or wrong, these people are still wrong. While it is certainly a B-Movie, it's not fun, and the only way to enjoy it would be to think \"at least these people are never, ever going to work again\", except that they probably will.The characters are totally bland cyphers who may as well be mannequins. This isn't \"light\" characterisation, it's non-existent characterisation, so I don't care what happens to them. Even when they should be scared or amazed - which the audience would at least relate to even if the characters redefine \"2 dimensional\" - the movie is too concerned with being cool to let us feel anything. There's so many bullet-time shots, video game clips (yeah, really), smug references to infinitely better movies and characters doing things solely so they can be put in danger that there's no truth to any of it; it's all soulless artifice that never progresses beyond the \"A House of the Dead movie would be cool!\" stage of its life.No feeling. No life. No soul. A void. See, those \"fun B-movies\" that people love to go on about as some kind of justification for supporting tripe like this... they might have had bad effects, laughable scripts and wooden acting, but the people involved were trying to make something entertaining. The people who made House of the Dead were going on a $12 million self-indulgent ego-trip, and clearly didn't care what the end result was because, hey, wouldn't a House of the Dead movie be cool? Answer: Possibly, if it was made by someone else.And, to cap it all off, they managed to take something as inherently cool as a VAMPIRE PIRATE, and then make him one of the most boring villains in history. If I made a movie, it would be about a vampire pirate killing the people who made this, then turning them into vampires so he could keep killing them. That would rule.Positive aspects: Topless women.Negative aspects: Everything else. You can also find topless women on the internet for free, and without supporting the makers of this film, rendering the only positive aspect moot.Don't be tempted to rent it because it might be so bad it's good. It's an infuriating pile of wank, and, combined with the recent \"hits\" Resident Evil and Underworld, has probably set horror back to the pleistocene period. If you could give 0/10, I would.

The zombies themselves weren't actually that rubbish but, the filmmakers habits of using bullet time over and over again to try and pad out the film and use footage that they had already shown made the film unbearable. I have never walked out of a film before and i wanted to with this but thought that i'd already paid five pound fifty might as well wait see if anything good happens, it didn't. The filmmaker used the same techniques too many times that it was just irritating, they used bullet time for each of the characters in the space of about five minutes, yes thats a brilliant technique but not when it's used to that extent. This film was trying to be something it's not, GOOD! How many times do we need to see different people with no legs waggling about on the floor, this film was too repetitive. It is such a same as this could have been an excellent film but it just didn't seem to know what to do with itself, it was trying too hard to be the next resident evil or something it didn't work was it a comedy who knows who can tell all i can say don't waste your time and money seeing this film when you can watch paint dry. It really was the worst film i have ever seen and i have seen a lot of bad movies.",

There is honestly nothing good that I can say about this one. The acting and script was cheesy, especially the character on the boat that wears the yellow raincoat. I kept waiting for one of the other characters to throw him off the boat.They included clips of the video game it was based on at various points for no reason. Maybe they wanted to remind everyone that it was based on a video game ... Maybe they wanted to make the movie another five minutes longer ...I also found the zombie fight scenes to be extremely terrible. Several times they show the scenes in slow motion (a la The Matrix).Another annoying point is that the show the zombies grab a tree about 8 times in the movie. Why do that?If you want to watch a zombie movie, watch Shaun of Dead (10/10) or Dawn of the Dead (8/10). Both are excellent alternatives",

In the game the character was some sort of government agent trying to save scientists in a house full of zombies created by an evil genius. The sad part is, this premise is arguably much better than the abomination Uwe turned it into. He threw out anything that likened it to its virtual counterpart.

The cop lady takes out her \"stainless steel\" shotgun with explosive rounds and shows it off to everyone else. Then, Captian Kirk opens his crate where he has a \"small\" arsenal. The black chick reaches in and grabs a handgun, where after Kirk says \"Desert Eagle, I like the way you think.\" After, we go through a small montage of each character reaching into Kirk's endless crate of weapons and taking something. They pulled out chain-linked bullets, but never a chain-gun. We see one of the characters take some grenades and strap them to her belt. It always surprises me that the US Army spends millions training its troops in proper grenade use but drunk teen-age girls going to a wave already know how. In fact, the characters in this movie strap themselves so full with weapons like sub-machine guns and TNT sticks but never really use them. This scene sucks all the masculinity out of guns that after when I was watching Scarface the last scene wasn't very exciting for me. \"House of the Dead\" is not only a movie that destroys itself, it also destroys every other movie you'll see.

            "content": "House of The Dead was the title of a famous video game developed by Rikya Nakagawa of SEGA. The game was designed as a first-person shooter, but what made it stand out from titles such as DOOM and QUAKE was that it was done in arcade format, known to many as the light gun, where rather than sitting back with a controller, the user can hold a gun within his/her own hands and try their best to survive against a horde of undead. This, along with the graphics, the obscene creatures and violence, made the game very popular. The story revolved around two government agents wearing trench coats investigating a mansion, where experiments conducted on zombies goes awry. Curiously, this came out at the same time with Resident Evil, which was more atmospheric. Now comes the film. Originally DreamWorks had the license, but later lost the rights, which were promptly bought by MINDFIRE's Mark Altman, who would serve as the co-writer and producer of this film. At first I was excited, for I loved Free Enterprise, which Altman had co-written with the director. Later, there were advertisements that showed a Robert Deniro-like zombie licking a girl's face, a scene that could have chilled the audience. However, after watching the film, this viewer, along with many others, emerged disappointed. The plot made absolutely no sense, the acting was poor, and although at times the creatures looked decent, Boll's lighting and directing made them laughable. What further weakened the film was the inclusion of video game footage and MATRIX shots, followed by scenes that were supposedly made to scare the audience. It's almost as if director Uwe Boll hadn't wanted to make a good film; rather, he just wanted to dazzle his audience. His interviews amusingly denied that it was a poorly-made film, making both this garbage and Boll even more pretentious than one would dare to attribute. As a fan of the games, one cannot help but miss the memorable nemeses that were in the game, particularly bosses like the Chariot and the Magician. As a fan of films, I'd occasionally enjoy a cheesy (and sometimes retarded) film, but with Boll's less than stellar hand, this film almost seemed to be a tragedy, for it could have been a fun horror film like EVIL DEAD. I do not deny that Boll is a movie fan, I only question his ability to direct.As a side-note, the writer's commentary on the DVD was interesting, for it explained what he had wanted to write. One could not help but feel sorry that his script was given to such an awful director, and that it had such a low budget, for it sounded quite promising. However, Altman does manage to redeem himself with the more mindlessly enjoyable HOUSE OF THE DEAD 2. Boll, on the other hand, continues to do video game adaptations, which includes FAR CRY, BLOODRAYNE, ALONE IN THE DARK, Dungeon Siege, and POSTAL, where in a bizarre publicity stunt he challenged his critics to a boxing match.",

He uses a HELL OF A LOT of those freeze frame tricks, and they detract from the movie, in my opinion. Too much eye candy causes brain decay, Uwe! Too much time expansion, I mean, come on, 5 to 7 minutes to cross 50 yards, even with zombies is a BIT MUCH! I didn't time it the first time, and I can't bring myself to watch it again to get the correct time. The first time felt like am eternity. I haven't seen anything this bad in years, and I can't remember last time I did, even stretching my considerable mental facilities to their fullest! I could have done better with a Betacam and a minimum editing facility, as long as I had a decent FX house behind me. The zombies were fairly decent, if, you guessed it, clich\u00e9. If you want a real zombie movie with a halfway decent plot and story, don't waste your time on this pile of recycled dreck, watch one of the Romero movies, or Sam Raimi's \"Evil Dead\" movies, or even one of the \"Return Of The Living Dead\" movies (except 4 or 5) *** LEAVE THIS ON THE SHELVES AT THE VIDEO STORE *** Even the sex scenes were clich\u00e9, and about as sexy as watching octogenarians go at it.My humble opinionBill",

The music is a weird hardcore hip hop with generic orchestra music that is awful and doesn't work at all. The editing is truly atrocious. Scenes go on way too long like the 10 minute fight to the cabin which is the worst part of the film along with cuts to the video game which don't fit at all and should've been cut.

This all leads to a truly awful pacing where you don't care at all about anyone, your not scare, or invested or waiting to see what happens next. you just want this to end because you are bored beyond belief.

            "content": "Most movies based off videogames are not good. In fact they're pretty much downright garbage. Which brings us to \"House of the Dead\" a 2003 Uwe Boll film adaptation of the popular arcade rail shooter. Some might have 2 questions.\n1. who's Uwe Boll? 2. What's a rail shooter?\n\n\nUwe Boll is a director synonymous with straight to DVD B movie horror/action ; with the \"Rampage\" trilogy, \"In the Name of the King 3\", and \"Bloodrayne\" 2 and 3. I don't know if \"House of the Dead\" got a theater release ,but if so I'm sure it was short lived. \n\nAs for rail shooters. They're your typical arcade shooting games house of the dead, area 51, metal slug. They're games were you're rout is predetermined, most of them move the character for you,you just aim and shoot. There's little dialogue and the plot is simplistic and usually explained in 2 or 3 brief cutscenes. They're still awesome games, but how do you expand on that to make a 90 minute movie? Well after watching \"House of the Dead\" I can tell you this movie is clearly not the answer.\n\nOur main characters consist of two douchey college guys, three hot girls( tough black girl,dumb blonde, and smart brunette), a kermudgenly German boat captain smuggling weapons, a coast guard badass chick, and Clint Howard as the first mate. That's a bad sign when you have a main party of seven actors nobody knows and Clint Howard is the most famous person in this film.\n\nOur group is on their way to the rave of the year which is being held on Isle de Muerte. Despite missing the ferry to the island and the German captains warning, they pay him to take them anyway. They show up to the island of death and find the rave completely deserted and wrecked( they even find a shirt covered in blood); but think nothing of it and pour themselves some beers and try to hookup.\n\nZombies inevitably show up and our troop of morons start running through the woods. The blonde girl gets zombified, and her stupid boyfriend then gets eaten. They run into another group of survivors who were at the rave earlier; including my favorite character ,Liberty(an Asian raver girl in a united States flag jumpsuit who kills zombies with knives and roundhouse kicks).\n\nKirk the German captain shows up to reveal he was smuggling weapons and all hell breaks loose as we get a bad zombie shoot em up; with shitty editing, and horrible techno music throughout. It's so generic that they keep splicing in footage from the \"House of the Dead\" videogame;like they have to keep reminding you that the movie is based on the game.\n\nThere's a Ludacris shoot out scene with a really bad P.O.D sounding song that goes on way too long. Characters and zombies start dieing left and right. There's still not much revealed about the plot. In fact we're not introduced to the villian until an hour and fifteen minutes into a hot and a half movie.\n\nThe villian is an evil scientist who's been doing experiments for centuries and has made an immortality serum( Original :/ ). He's doing some weird stuff to make a perfect being,not really sure; even the short exposition is vague. He bites the dust in a death so ridiculous I won't ruin it if you decide to watch this movie. The movie ends in a cliffhanger thinking there will be a sequel, and guess what? They made \"House of the Dead 2\".\n\nSo as far as bad videogame movies go House of the Dead is upper echelon trash. Is it worth a watch? With enough of your friends to rip on it, it's definitely worth a view. It's by no means good, but it's so stupid and poorly done it's funny.\n\n2/5",

            "content": "Another Uwe Boll video game adaptation means yet another inept effort at making a watchable film. This time we take what I'm sure is a heavily plotted, intelligent and character driven game that demanded a film adaptation (not really) and make it into a boring, generic zombie movie. It's \"House of the Dead\" people, and it sucks. The plot begins with a character informing us that he will be the only survivor. I love it when bad movies spoil their own endings; it's the equivalent a kid with no legs challenging a pro soccer player to a game. At least this movie has the courtesy of letting me know it's garbage right away, instead of jerking me around.\n\nSimon (Tyron Leitso) introduces his soon-to-be-dead friends: Greg (Will Sanderson), Alicia (Ona Grauer), Karma (Enuka Okuma) and Xynthia (Sonya Salomaa, possibly playing some kind of alien that happens to look like a human). They want to go to an awesome rave party taking place on an island but little do they know, the place is overrun by zombies. Hitching a ride there by paying two smugglers (Jurgen Prochnow as Captain Victor Kirk and his first Mate Salish, played by Clint Howard) they are chased by a harbor police officer named Jordan Casper (Ellie Cornell). It's a struggle for survival and a struggle for the audience to resist falling asleep.\n\nThe only good thing about this film is the makeup effects, which are actually pretty convincing. There's a huge army of zombies attacking our heroes and they come in all kinds of shapes and sizes. We've got aquatic zombies that can swim, moss-covered zombies that hide in the dirt, ancient skeletal zombies and even fresh zombies that basically look like regular people but with some blood all over them. If there's one good thing that could come out of this film, it's a recommendation to any aspiring horror filmmakers to hire the costume and makeup artists that were involved in this movie. Everything else is downright terrible.\n\nNot only does the movie drop the ball from the very beginning by telling us exactly who is going to make it out alive and who isn't but it commits the biggest sin in cinema \"show, don't tell\". We don't learn in any way that's organic who the main characters are, we are simply told exactly enough information to distinguish the actors from each other with exposition at the beginning of the movie. Considering the fact that the acting is pretty weak here, maybe it was a last minute decision by director Uwe Boll to avoid as many scenes of the actors talking as possible. Some would give props to the man, but I say next time, just hire real actors\n\nThe plot is utterly predictable, not only because we are told ahead of time what is going to happen (no, I will not let that go), but because it doesn't do anything new when it comes to the zombie horror genre. Basically every scene of people talking is just an excuse to tie together an accompanying scene where the humans are running away from or shooting at zombies. To remind us that this is a video game movie, and also presumably to obliterate any tension that might arise, the film constantly flashes to video game-y scenes. We've got clips of the game the film is based on, as well as \"game over\" type screens for some of the characters that end up biting the dust. I wish I could make up something as stupid as this. Can you imagine if someone re-edited \"Saving Private Ryan\" and called it \"Call of Duty\" by adding \"game over\" screens whenever someone was shot down? Even that movie, which is widely accepted as a masterpiece would be laughed out of theatres, so what chance does \"House of the Dead\" have with its undead-like acting abilities and paper-thin story? The movie can't even stay consistent because only some of the actors are dignified with a death screen. Meanwhile, we get 32 nearly-identical shots of polygon-based undead creatures getting shot in the face.\n\nIt's never particularly scary and even if what the hacks in charge were aiming for was a horror-action movie, leaning more towards action it would still suck the big one. There's a big scene where all of the characters have found an ammo crate (get it? Like in a video game!) and suit up for battle. They make their way to the mysterious \"house of the dead\" and encounter a huge army of zombies. For a while, it's pretty cool to see. Our remaining heroes take down legions of undead using various weapons and fancy fighting moves but the scene drags on and on. It begins by being kind of cool (maybe because before then you were falling asleep) then becomes ridiculous and funny and finally ends by being totally boring.\n\nEven the ending of the movie ends in a big WTF moment that doesn't really make any sense. Even if you had the lowest standards imaginable, and I have been known to exhibit this illness, and basic zombie action with frequent moments of \"girls gone wild\" type nudity would interest you, the plot is so badly written, so poorly acted that there is no way you can enjoy yourself. I laughed at a moment where a party goer refused to go skinny dipping with a hot woman just so he could get killed by a zombie but like so many of Uwe Boll's films, you can't even enjoy this film ironically. It was a chore to get through and while I can, once again, praise the special effects, the surrounding story is terrible and you shouldn't waste your time with \"House of the Dead\".

Uwe Boll clearly is in the business to only make money because his directing here is horrendous as hell and you can tell he just doesn't care. This is also one of the most poor examples I have ever seen of a video game movie. Not even the action scenes were enjoyable because they were shot terribly and the filmmakers think that using 360 degree spins with the camera inhance them but they only make them worse. Another bad thing they do is put in images from The House of the Dead video game when they transition to the next scene or when a character is killing a zombie and that made the film even worse. In the end, this becomes a movie that leaves you wandering why they made it.",

I could respect that - really, I could! As awful as most of Roger Corman's films were, at the very least, he never took himself so seriously that he couldn't bring himself to give us a wink when having the clothes torn off of appallingly objectified women or subjecting us to gruesome, poorly effected close-ups. But Boll? His arrogance prevents him from accepting his mediocrity and we are forced to suffer for his cinematic sins. \n\nThe film industry has provided us with some truly and legendarily hideous directors.

I have since gone back on that statement for a couple of reasons. Don't get me wrong though. I don't consider it to be any sort of a masterpiece, or even craptastic. It still falls into the category of being an awful movie, but there are a couple of things about it that brought me around to it a little bit more. First of all, there are, in my opinion, very overt humorous moments built into the movie. You don't catch them the first time through because you're too busy focusing on how terrible the whole thing is. Second, it has Clint Howard and William Sanderson in it, so that's got to count for something. Third, it has Ona Grauer's amazing cleavage bouncing around at every turn. Fourth, it's a very good adaptation of the game. Some might call me crazy for saying that, but if you've ever played the game, you know how terrible the story, the story logic and the dialogue is in those games. This movie matches that successfully. It's not that Uwe Boll knew what he was doing or anything (Alone in the Dark proves that), but his lack of talent makes it all work somehow. I can't say that I'd want to stick this on very often, but I did find it slightly more enjoyable this go round and I guess that's the most positive thing I can say about a movie everybody is so negative about - including myself.",

Uwe Boll has gotten himself the reputation of being one of the worst Hollywood directors in history. Based on a popular video game, House of the Dead is a poorly made film that is beyond awful. House of the Dead will disappoint harden zombie fans because this is poorly conceived trash. This film has one thing going for it, it's unintentionally humorous. This film is so bad, that it's hilarious. Uwe Boll actually placed video games scenes in his movie to give it a \"video game\" type feel. Instead, it's hilarious. The use of cinematography is criminal in this film. Now, I'm an epileptic, and whenever the camera started spinning, I had to cover my eyes because it felt like I was going to have a seizure. If you're looking for a good, entertaining zombie film, you won't find it here because Uwe Boll can't write an effective plot to his films (under the very rare occasion, he's managed to direct two or three watchable films). However, House of the Dead is not watchable, this is a film with no plot, and bad acting, bad special effects, and it feel like a sci fi channel made for TV movie. House of the Dead is yet another prime example as to why video game to screen adaptations do not work. Occasionally they do, but not in the case of Uwe Boll's House of the Dead. If you're looking for a good zombie action film, watch Resident Evil instead, and skip this film. You'll be glad you did.",

It has a poor storyline, questionable characters possessing fighting abilities out of thin air and a final baddie with a stupid agenda for all the mayhem. I wouldn't even call this a zombie film because the undead seem to die from any kind of strike being given. The camera shots, when the characters are in battle, have seizure-like qualities and the random screen shots of the game are just idiotic.

The pirate zombies plot kinda made sense but it was too ridiculous the red cuts were stupid and the video game footage inserted directly into the film was just so mind-boggling. The film in general was so laughably horrible I mean shooting games aren't that hard to convert into film but this is just pushing it.

I know nothing of the craft of making making movies. I, however, realize that there is something fundamentally amiss in us as humans when things such as 'House of the Dead' are allowed to exist.\n\nAccording to IMDB this 'film' was produced to the tune of $7,000,000 USD.\n\nYou watch TV, right? Who doesn't? Don't you hate when you turn on the old boob tube and see some poor starving kid clogging up screen space? I hate seeing that shit! Makes me feel guilty as hell. \"For only $.35 a day you too could support little Whatshisface or Whosehername or a child like him or her.\" Ok, Starving Kids Foundation let's do some math. $7,000,000 is 20 million kids for one day. Or let's just say a kid is only a kid until they can help out the family by working at the local Nike factory. We'll say 12 years old. That means that if this film never existed and some nice investor gave the money instead to the Starving Kids Foundation, said foundation could feed 4,563 kids until the age of 12. Instead we have 'House of the Dead'.\n\nWhat is there to say that has not already been said? The only reason to write another review of this movie is to demonstrate your creative ability in thinking up further insults for it. Flaming pile of dog shit. Already been used? Damn. Like watching a late term abortion performed with a piece of jagged glass by a drunk man. Mildly creative. So terrible it will literally give you AIDS. Kinda funny.\n\nMore succinctly: if I were a billionaire my first priority would be to buy a giant robot suit (starving kids be damned). Think Gundam. My second priority would be to send out a message to every person who is in possession of this movie on DVD or film. I would offer a bounty. This would include all people who bought it on DVD ironically as well. I would buy all instances of this film and have them destroyed. Further, I would purchase Boll KG and have it disbanded and all workprints of this movie destroyed so as to make it impossible for anybody to ever reproduce it. Further, I would purchase Uwe Boll's assurance to never make another movie again under penalty of nutsack punching. Everyone has a price.\n\nThis movie is so bad that, ideally, I would figure out a way to retrieve the electromagnetic wave broadcasts of this movie from space so as to not accidentally subject space aliens to watching it. Have them stick to 'I Love Lucy'.\n\nAnd so why did I watch it? Well, because I love zombies. Why did I finish watching it? Because I had a deer in the headlights reaction. My fight or flight response did not kick in and consequently I was run over by this film. No. I was run over, then backed over, then backed over again, then doused in gasoline and lit on fire by this film.\n\nTotally and completely abysmal.",

But they really needed to put a hell of a lot more effort into this - craft a better story and not have the dialogue and general feel be so silly.\n\nThe action was a mix of intricate and over the top camera swirls and slow motion, and the zombie costumes were mostly shoddy.",

The editing is very poor, storyline is messy, characters are stereotypical and the random flashes of the video game make no sense. However, put all that aside and there's actually a pretty funny film that I enjoyed watching so it's not all bad, but certainly not all good either.",

            "content": "House of the Dead is perhaps one of the worst video game movies of all time. Why? It's directed by Uwe Boll. That says a lot. For those of you who do not know who Uwe Boll is, he is a German director who has a reputation for making some of the worst movies of all time, but considers them to be good and has no intentions of retiring. He's widely considered to be the new Ed Wood. For those of you who don't know who Ed Wood is, well, google him along with Uwe Boll if you like. Anyway, this movie is almost nothing like the game it was based off of. It feels like somebody made an original zombie film and slapped the House of the Dead title on it. It's not even set in a house. The whole thing takes place on an island. None of the characters from the game appear either. They're all movie-exclusive characters. Most of the actors are pretty much all unknowns, with the exception of Eliie Cornell, Jonathan Cherry, J\u00fcrgen Prochnow, and Clint Howard. They had done some mentionable work before this. The acting wasn't exactly spectacular either. One thing I don't understand is why Uwe Boll decided to splice in footage of the actual gameplay during the action scenes. Maybe that was the only way to connect the movie to the game? Since nothing else really seemed to follow. Whatever the case, I found it to be annoying and completely distracting. Honestly, this movie probably would have been pretty good if it wasn't called House of the Dead and didn't have the video game scenes. The only things in common the movie had with the games were the enemies, a first person shooter scene toward the end, and the main Character Rudy's last name being Curien. Other than that, it's really got nothing to do with the classic arcade game. As a zombie movie, it's not too bad. As a House of the Dead movie, it's awful. If you have never played a House of the Dead game and know absolutely nothing about it, than you may like this movie. But fans of the games, you might want to stay away.",

I thought it might have been that first-person shooter in the arcade where you just shoot zombies in a haunted house, but that couldn't be it, right?  That's barely a premise for a video game, never mind a movie, RIGHT?  Well, that's what it is, and in case you forgot what it is, they continually splice (and I am not making this up) actual action from the video game into the movie... Yeah.  What the hell were they thinking?  So the rave of the year (thrown by Sega, of all companies) is being thrown on this island that attracts this annoying band of twenty-somethings.  The island is soon overrun by zombies, but not any zombies.  We are talking jumping, acrobatic zombies that could easily compete in a triathlon.  The survivors try to escape the island.  It's a movie that does everything wrong.  As a zombie movie, it just makes up rules as it pleases, with zombie bites sometimes changing the victims into the undead, and sometimes just leaving the victim with a bite mark.  There are a number of noticeable continuity errors, and it blatantly rips off a number of different movies, like The Matrix and The Lord of the Rings.  The acting is amazingly bad and the dialogue is filled with \"are you fucking kidding me?\"  You can find more likable characters in a Friday the 13th movie, and pretty much the only thing this movie has going for it is that it has some pretty cool music that sounds like a Prodigy knockoff band.  There's this hilarious part in the movie where they take literal breaks in the action to give every single character a freeze frame 360 shot.  It's impressively bad, but there's a reason why Uwe Boll is so infamous.",

I am going to review house of the dead and I got to say this is one of the most underrated film ever. But really a 4% and a spot in IMDB bottom 100 to me it's not that bad.\r\n\r\nA while ago me and my brother Zac were renting films and we decide to rent this. At he back it says When Night of the Living Dead meets XXX and I thought it looks like a cool film so we picked it up and rented it along with a few others so the first film we watched was this and I have to say it was a good film. In Meany ways it was a bit dumb. But still I have seen it 32 times to date.\r\nI have got to say I find this Uwe Bolls best film at least he tried in this. So far but my brother says it's Farcry that I will likely never see.\r\nBy the way this was Uwe Boll's only finically successful film that did well at the box office.\r\n\r\nThe story to the film is a rave on a small island inhabited by zombies who will kill anyone who comes onto there island. A bit stupid but I a good idea that was poorly done. In a way I can not really see any other story line for a house of the dead film likely because I have seen this so Meany times. There are a big number of plot holes and if these people were smart they could just swim off the island to the main land it is only about 2, 3 km if they really wanted to get off the island. I have to say I thought the action scenes were good that's another reason why I liked this film. \r\nThe acting I have to say is mixed to average it's not terrible or bad or that good it's just really average.\r\nSome of the action scenes were really good but a bit ridicules but still enjoyable. The visual effects and for a film like this were good usually in an Uwe Boll film they would be retarded and messed up looking.  The zombies and the make up used was really good for the hundreds of zombies they used.\r\n\r\nBut overall I think it's just to underrated many of you will really disagree with me. But I am also having a hard time weather to recommend it just watch if you really won't to. Or if you're a die hard fan of zombie films.",

This really is a terrible movie, but its great to invite a few friends over and really have fun drinking and making fun of it, ala mst3k.\r\n\r\nThe film is a Zombie horror movie starring a bunch of nobodies and Erica Durance, who would later go on to play Lois Lane in Smallville. What we have here is a bunch of 20 somethings that are on their way to a rave on a remote island, they hire a seedy sea captain named Kirk, to transport them. When they get to the island however, well, i cant ruin it for you but let me tell you... its hilarious.\r\n\r\nSo there are a ton of things in this movie to keep you watching, like terribly delivered lines, horrible acting, barely any continuity, and of course blatantly stolen scenes from other movies. I'm not kidding about the last part, most of the scenes that they steal are from the Lord of the Rings trilogy. I cant actually believe that this movie made 1 million over their budget at the theaters. I am going to have to give this craptastic film 1/10 for being mildly funny but not scary whatsoever.\r\n\r\nSee it with friends\r\n\r\nSid",

It would almost be funny if it wasn't so painful.  The worst acting i have EVER seen and the worst script i've ever heard.  Also, only 15 minutes (tops) of the movie take place in the actual house...most takes place on an island and some in the catacombs (a mine) since Boll gets cheap access to islands and mines.  In addition they keep flashing clips of the video game in the middle of the scenes.  I am not sure if this was supposed to remind you what movie you were watching or what...but it was just stupid.  among the worst costumes and make up i have ever seen, some of the zombies are hilarious (not intentionally).

            "content": "Recently, I decided to bite the bullet and watch a Uwe Boll movie. If it was actually worth it is definitely questionable, but, I did manage to get some good laughs and a new Top Worst Film of All Time.\n\nSo, let's get this out of the way. Uwe Boll's House of the Dead lives up to the hype. It really is the worst (zombie) movie ever made. I cannot stress that enough really...it IS pure crap. Honestly, the only thing this movie is good for is unintentional laughs or a good nap. I found myself dozing off in a few of the action scenes as they were just plain boring. (And for some reason I decided to rewind some of them to see if I missed out on story?whoops! Bad mistake there)! The acting is atrocious, the score is beyond annoying (seriously, techno beats throughout the whole movie??), the story is almost non-existent, the characters are unbelievable and unlikeable (we get nil development and all stupidity) and the special effects are appalling.\n\nFor those who have no idea what House of the Dead is about, it is only fair to fill you in. Based off the popular rail-shooting arcade games, this follows a group of teens who are trying to get to a rave on an island. They miss their scheduled boat by 15 minutes, so they pay a smuggler to take them there. Upon arrival, they discover everyone is gone and the place is trashed. Do they leave? Nope, they stay for the free beer and to wander around in groups. They soon discover the island is infested with zombies, so they take refuge in a house and try survive the night.\n\nI do not know what could have been going through Boll's brain (if it exists) when he was making this. Shouldn't a smart, normal human realise they are making a bad movie when your teenage ravers can shoot shotguns, desert eagles and sub-machine guns with 100% precision and accuracy? Oh, and they can also perform high level martial arts! Shouldn't an intelligent man know its a bad movie when your action scenes directly rip-off \"The Matrix\" with poor CGI and dodgy slo-mo? Finally, how the holy $#*& can someone think inserting game footage into the movie makes it better? I am not joking when I say this, Boll actually includes numerous clips from the game during the action scenes and even includes a Game Over screenshot when one of the ravers dies! House of the Dead is consistently good at being absolute trite. With zombies that look identical (and are able to swim, sword-fight and get angered by breaking tanks full of red water), with bullets igniting barrels of gunpowder and with the power to get stabbed and die, but get up and crush a zombie's head only to die again, Uwe Boll has successfully created the most idiotic film in history. The movie is funny, though, and many could find joy at laughing at the many plot holes and clich\u00e9s abundant throughout. Moreover, the random nudity may please some? Congratulations, Mr. Boll, you have managed to rape what could have been at least a mediocre movie!",

The whole film is crap if you are going to take it seriously, if you try and have stupid fun with it, it might turn out as not as bad as it is. But overall, it is not really fully recommended, but if you are feeling like a cheesy horror zombie film, with stupid characters, screenplay and direction. This is the one. The only reason i watched this film is because I felt like watching something bad after the 2014 Academy Awards, and I wanted to see if Uwe Boll lives to the awfulness I heard about him, he is just trying to make cheesy films, with cliches all over the place that turn out, despite outdated, funny and entertaining.",

Wow...my opening joke here sucks.Acting/characters: Shallow, generic, and underdeveloped that's all I can say about them. I kept hoping that there would be someone in the whole film who I would think \"maybe this one will be different and kinda likable\" out of the whole cast, no one fit that bill. I can't even remember their names without looking them up with the exception of Kirk. Even as I write this, their names and faces slip from my mind. That is for the best I feel. I just do not care about them whatsoever. Who could? Maybe the 3 or 4 people out there who like this film say 'the characters are so incidental because this is a cheesy action flick and nothing more.' To those 3 or 4 people (including Uwe Boll) I say, if I want this many faceless characters, I'll go play the video game itself. It's a movie so it should have at least one character worth anything. This doesn't. Plus, the character who narrates the film is so dumb. Well, not just him, the whole concept of the character. A narrator is our protagonist. We are seeing the film from his or her eyes. This guy wasn't in the film for the first third of it. Once he was you never got to really know him at all. It's like he was just there and was narrating it in passing later. I dunno maybe the script did have a likable character, well if so, the actors killed it. They all absolutely sucked. I think one of them went on to do something worthwhile after this...how? They were monotonous, blank, and uninteresting. 0/10Plot: I've read the plot to the original game. This one is supposed to be a prequel to that game in a sense...no matter what angle you look at it from the two are not connected plot-wise at all. This would be fine I suppose but Uwe Boll decided to use a plot that has been circulating on the Slasher Genre for decades: Teenagers at a party in an abandoned location are being killed off. So, not only did he not even try to tie it into the actual source material itself, he decided to use an old, over-used plot to do it. Way to go Uwe! You've sunk to a new low. At least I haven't seen the plot to Alone in the dark 50 times in 50 different movies like this one. You didn't even try. You didn't even try. 0/10Screenplay: If I asked Uwe Boll what he thought about the script for this film he would give me a blank stare and say 'the what for my film?' an exaggeration to be sure, but not that much of one. Some lines in there just had my head ringing. Which ones?...all of them...yeah, all of them. I don't know who wrote this screenplay or why but they should be banned from ever making a screenplay again. This comes off like some kid wrote it. No offense to kids. Come on people this is a movie1 You get paid to do this! Now I'm not saying it has to be Casablanca but can you please not try to outdo Troll 2 in terms of stupidity? 0/10Likableness: I add Uwe Boll to my list of directors who love slow-mo too much (move over Michael Bay and Zack Snyder). And he's just friggin' lazy too. There is one shot that he reuses 4 DIFFERENT TIMES!!! I mean come on! Twice is pushing it but 4!?!?! I highly disliked this film and I will probably never watch it again. I would advise everyone who has not seen this to go and watch something better. Like the Garfield movie (oh snap) and leave this alone. It was terrible. I give this one a solid 0/10.Final Score: 0/40Tomatometer rating: 4%Tomatometer rating if my review was added: 4%TRIVIA TIME: 1. The fisherman with the hook (gaff) at the beginning of the movie is a reference to the killer in I Know What You Did Last Summer.2. At the beginning of the movie, Greg says, \"Who's the U-boat captain?\" when he sees Capt. Viktor Kirk. Prochnow was the captain in Das Boot.3. Jonathan Cherry burned 30% of his hand on the second day of shooting. The scene on the bridge, where he hurts his hand, was shot later, to explain the bandage he had to wear.4. Reviews were so bad that Danish cinemas refused to buy it.5. House of the Dead is the last film to use the turn-table technique for 360\u00c2\u00b0 shots. The risk of actors being hurt or killed by the fast-moving camera was too much.",

This movie is a monument, no doubt of it. Where did it go wrong? Oh yes, adapting a rail-shooter game as a movie. Why did no one instantly react to this idea? Anyway the worst is done. Now let's review it.Overall acting is terrible. Dialogues are one of the dumbest of the whole history of cinema. Women (excepted the cop one) are all here to showcase their breasts (and their bodies in some extent). Scenario is dreadful, unoriginal and predictable. Jokes are unfunny, dull and vulgar. Some scenes are plagiarized from 'Jaws'. Special effects, costumes and make-up are horrible. Overall lighting is a mess. Characters are over-stereotyped. It is impossible to develop any empathy for any of them. Scenes are awfully shot, with way too many cuts and inappropriate flashes of the original game. Sega company takes its enormous bundles of bills in the beginning of the movie when they accepted to show their brand during that truly indecent party. Music and original score are agressive and also inappropriate. I found pace was quite good excepted during fights which all were way too long.Don't get me wrong, despite the 2/10 it is clearly a movie that I will rewatch with pleasure because I certainly missed a lot of its flaw on the first view. I am quite fascinated by this.",
