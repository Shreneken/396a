Who is telling the truth, or more importantly is it even possible to know when all we are anyway is a half remembered collection of memories, are notions thrown at us and left for us to determine on our own. This is a film that probably could never have worked as a live action film simply because the changes between reality, memory and movie could never be as seamless as they are here.This is a movie for grown ups and very clearly shows why those who think animated films are only for kids is missing out.",

            "content": "In some films, the dividing line between subjective and objective reality is very tenuous. In Satoshi Kon's poetic Japanese anim\u00e9 film Millennium Actress, it is almost non-existent. When the Ginei studio is about to be razed, documentarian Genya Tachibana decides to make a documentary about the studio and its greatest star, legendary actress Fujiwara Chiyoko who disappeared from public life more than thirty years ago. After finding an old key that belonged to the aging actress, he travels to her secluded mountain retreat with his assistant Kyogi Ida to interview her for the documentary. When Genya gives her the key, it unlocks a stream of memories that transports us (along with the cameraman and interviewer) to a different reality that allows us to relive one thousand years of Japanese history using the medium of cinema. As she tells her story, Chiyoko recounts her birth at the time of the great Kanto earthquake of 1923 and how she was discovered as a child actress despite her mother's objection that she is too timid. She reveals how a strange young painter, a political outcast whose name she never discovers, gives her a key and then disappears, telling her that the key is \"the most important thing there is\". Chiyoko's dream of reuniting with her lover keeps her alive and becomes what her life is about. Unfolding more as emotion and mood than narrative, Kon takes us on a surreal journey through a series of films within films in which Chiyoko attempts to find her lost love, playing a princess, a ninja, a geisha, and even an astronaut. In the process, we witness a seamless tableau of Japan's history: the medieval period in the 15th and 16th centuries, the era when the Shogunate was in power, the Meiji period when the Emperor was restored, the Showa period before World War II, and the post-war occupation and recovery. The line between events of Chiyoko's real life and scenes from her films is blurred and the film is difficult to follow on first viewing. To complicate matters even further, the interviewer, Genya, is cast in many roles in which he becomes almost a comic figure as Chiyoko's rescuer. Though the film is often puzzling, the search to recapture the defining moment in Chiyoko's life strikes a universal chord and we identify with her desperate quest. Though I found the ending somewhat unsatisfying, Millennium Actress is a complex and beautiful film and Susumu Hirasawa's hypnotic musical score adds to the blend of warmth, emotional power, and magical realism. Kon sees life as a big romantic movie full of melodrama, humor, and longing and seems to be saying that while there is often confusion between who we really are and the shifting roles we play in life, what remains constant is our longing for love.",

            "content": "Satoshi Kon is the extremely talented director who brought us the memorable Perfect Blue (1997) and perhaps changed the face of Japanimation forever. Here at his second feature film, ripe after a four years hiatus, he makes the wait well-worthed with a cunning cinematographic experience that literally plunges the viewer into the wonderful world of film.Using the animation medium to push storytelling in film to new levels of effectiveness, Kon tells the story of a legendary actress who's life and career sparks the interest of documentary director Genya Tachibana.  Along with his trusted cameraman, he undertakes to interview the now very old Chiyoko Fujiwara, spotlight actress in her hay days, and together they delve into her past.This session blooms into a captivating narrative, blending elements of her life with roles in some of her films, and exploring her great search for love.  The movie thus explores the personal challenges and self-realization that one undergoes through the different stages of life.  It does so with the help of probing questions from Genya and is not shy of being epic in scale, passing seamlessly through fictional eras and time periods, superimposing characters, persons and life teachings.  The fusion of reality and fiction is truly remarkable, and Satoshi Kon distinguishes himself from conventional dogmas in that aspect.  For him, sky is the limit.  He is only limited by his boundless imagination.  The result is something fresh and spectacular.  From the beauty of the vibrant images to the backdrop of lyricism and poetry, the movie explores life with us... and comes up with interesting conclusions.  You will have to see and judge for yourself, but I promise that, if nothing else, it will have made you think.I was privileged to attend the world premiere at the Montreal FantAsia Festival and was greatly honored to be blessed with the incarnation of the director himself, in flesh and bone.  He strikes me as a very intelligent, very mature and wise man.  There is an old woman in the film who says to Chiyoko: \"I love you and I hate you more than you can imagine.\"  I asked him the significance of that and he simply answered: \"I do not really know what it means.  I know that I understand many things that I did not 15 years ago. I just tried to project myself in the future, and thought of what I might be able to bestow to a younger inexperienced person like myself, with this increased wisdom that comes with life's trials and tribulations.\"  I admit I am paraphrasing just a little (my japanese is not that good in any case), but that's essentially what he said, and this confirmed my belief, based on the artistic genius and masterful integration of complex thoughts into a simple, flowing, living piece, that this man is gifted.  He has an incredible depth and is able to conjure it up to the surface and present it to us.  One cannot but delight in his work and wait again for more enlightenment...A suivre...",

Watching this one made me forget this was an anime as I became fascinated by the life moving before me.  Chiyoko is amazing at any age or time; her determination, spirit, and energy are infectiously admirable.  Note the interviewer and our skeptical camera guy are third party observers in the dark, just like ourselves.  Someone watching this mentioned how great the soundtrack is which adds a whole other level and really establishes pace, mood, and atmosphere throughout.

            "content": "Genya Tachibana is a TV documentary maker and has tracked down his favourite actress; Chiyoko Fujiwara. On interviewing her Genya presents her with an object she had lost long ago; a key. From there we are transported through time and see Chyoko story about lost love and her struggle to find it. The key belonged to a man she meet when she was young. He was a rebel on the run and Chiyoko gave him shelter. He gave her the key as a thank-you. When he disappears she sets out to find this man. Still young, Chiyoko is approached by a film maker to star in his new film; she accepts and sees this as a chance to find mysterious man. She become a huge success, but she is always empty, never finding the man she loves.Satoshi Kon has created a wonderful film about the lose of love and the extraordinary lengths one woman will go to find it. What makes this an interesting watch is that when we go into Chiyoko's past, Genya and his camera man also walk around in her past; interacting with people. But its just not a trek through her past, her memories meld with the movies she has made; as the movies parallel her life on her journey of finding her love, but also time in history. The scenes we see are from the movies she has made, but the story is her own life; her reality and her imagination have just crashed into one another.The animation here is just visually amazing. Satoshi Kon's character designs are so unique they set themselves apart from another animations. All the backgrounds are so detailed and textured. What i find great is that Satoshi Kon adds that tiny bit of surrealism; adding more dimension and thought, here its how Chiyoko's memories meld into the movies she's starred in. Satoshi's script is so deep and full of angst. Its hard to watch this woman on her quest for love always failing; yet she blindly keeps going no matter what.At great movie about the journey of love and how its never ending; in this world and the next.",

            "content": "If you have seen any other movies by Satoshi Kon (Perfect Blue, Tokyo Godfathers), you get the idea that he knows how to tell a story. The stories are told in a dramatic, yet unconventional way. The story is about a Japanese movie studio that is torn down. The current executive in charge gets an interview with the studio's star actress, whom has been living in seclusion for years and does not give interviews. The movie seamlessly integrates dramatic moments, with light humor and stunning visuals. The visuals are breathtakingly imaginative not in that they are exotic and surreal, but rather stunningly realistic. Where Perfect Blue is more about the dark side of human nature, this movie is about the resilience of the human spirit and hope. What is similar, is that the reality of the story is in question. What is real, and what is perceived, is based on the perspective of the viewer. Definitely a must see movie.-Celluloid Rehab",

I'm glad I did.This seems to be viewed only by fans of anime, and that's a shame. I'm not knowledgeable enough in anime to note how it fits. It seems to be in the more \"realistic\" spectrum, with fewer edges and less posturing.Japanese writing has gravity. In traditional mode, the eye falls down as it gathers a phrase. The characters are derived from ink on paper instead of the western fonts shaped by chisel on stone. And where the characters I use in English have no inherent semiotic association, Kanji is inherently pictographic. A Japanese reader will literally harvest phases by falling through images, images in a static situation with dynamic sweeps therein.So when I come to anime, I look for this. Being nonJapanese, I can see it and appreciate it more than a native can I believe.That's why I'm excited about this, because the visual phrases are imposed on some folds I know. First about the folds. The way this is structured is as a double documentary of an aged film star, \"Sunset Blvd\"-wise. Its double because we have a camera and we are seeing the two documentarians: one the interviewer and the other with a camera. (We never get a view through that camera, I think.)The interview blends with the actress's flashbacks. Now this is very clever, how this is done.It isn't memory: the documentarians are physically there when a \"past\" episode occurs. The cameraman constantly asks \"what next?\" and the interviewer takes on the role of certain characters in the films. These really are films, we see, when sometimes the \"camera\" rolls back and we see the crew. This is a third camera.But more: all of the films over many decades conflate and merge, interweaving back and forth through history, forming a single quest for a love. That love is for a painter, who clearly is the animator of this cartoon, \"Duck Amuck\"-wise. These films not only merge with each other, and the quest, and the \"interview,\" but with her life proper.As with \"8 1/2 Women,\" earthquakes figure in the shifts and overlays of stories. The thing that binds it all is a \"key\" which we learn early is to a paintbox, the source of all the paintings we see. Its wonderful organic oneiric origama. oneiroticama.And that's just the story. Watch how the phrases are constructed though. We fall through them, soft layer after cloudy image.Its like relaxing into love with perfect trust. You really should see this.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",

Fluid scene transitions, vibrant colors, and gorgeous pieces of music not only allow, but forces the viewer to feel empathy for the character. I admit, I was teary eyed for several scenes in the movie, it's cinema at its best.The story, like Kon's Perfect Blue, is told in a way where reality and fantasy are blurred and joined. Unlike Perfect Blue, the truth and fiction are not important matters in Millennium Actress. Perfect Blue was a movie about an event. Millennium Actress is a movie about an emotion: Love. That search for the long lost love is the only thing that keeps one young. Chiyoko, the main character, travels through centuries and millenniums to find it, but always fails. Yet her zealous passion for this quest is what ultimately keeps her young, even at death.Watching this film, we will all be reminded of that one passion we've had during our youthful days and be reminded about our quest to fulfill that passion. Maybe that feeling will return after you've viewed this movie. Maybe you'll regret certain actions and decisions that you've made in the past. But that's of no importance. Because at that point, the film has done its job and you'll feel a little warmer inside.",

Millennium Actress is outstanding in every regard. The animation style is both beautiful and surreal, which is a very good mix. The music is truly wonderful, ethereal and haunting, without overbearing or underplaying the drama. The dialogue is thought-provoking and emotionally complex. Millennium Actress really is also a masterstroke in storytelling, there is always something happening yet the story manages to be told in poignant, truthful, thoughtful and sometimes funny ways. The characters are interesting and well-defined, as well as always relateable to the audience. The voice acting does nothing to undermine this, being dynamic and expressive. Overall, outstanding both as an animated film and film in general, and Kon's second best of a truly impressive resume. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "Chiyoko Fujiwara: even her names evokes 1,000 years of Japanese history beginning with the Fujiwara clan who dominated Japan a millennium ago as she dominated Japanese movies. The story begins with an elderly actress who recounts her life and career to a Quixotically worshipful producer and his Sancho Panza-like cameraman. Film juxtaposes with reality; and the triumphs and tragedies of one actress meld into those of Japan itself; objectivity and fantasy mock each other and dance with one another. At one moment the cameraman is making a pungent comment about cornball emotions, and the next moment he is dodging burning arrows from one of her movies. Perhaps, Chiyoko really is a woman cursed or perhaps blessed to endure 1,000 years of unrequited love. Perhaps the mysterious \"human-rights activist\" that she pursues through the centuries, and through one movie after another, represents an ever-receding ideal of love, truth, and human dignity that is yearned for by individuals and nations alike. They met just briefly, he gave her the key to \"the most important thing in the world,\" and Chiyoko and the film characters she plays spend the next 1,000 years and the rest of her film career and the rest of her life trying to return it.\"Millennium Actress\" and the techniques of animation were made for each other. Live-action could not possibly have created this stunning plunge though the centuries nearly as well, nor have depicted the transformation of a beautiful young women into a beautiful old woman. So-called live-action movies would have buried a live actress under layers of Yoda-like plastic to achieve the same effect.Presumably you will be watching this on DVD; after you have watched this movie through once or twice, go back and select scene 12 and just watch that: it begins with an apprentice Geisha, (as played by Chiyoko), risking everything to pursue the human-rights activist (in this generation he is a rebel Samurai.) A merciless Javert-like pursuer barges in to ruin everything, but a Quixotic stranger rescues her for sake of idealistic love and sets her free to ride through the land of Japan to continue her search. She rides through Hokusai landscapes and through the battles of 19th-Century Japan. She continues undaunted even though the wheel of her curse keeps turning and is symbolized by increasingly modern modes of transportation: carriages, trains, bicycles; the splendor and tragedy of Japanese history whizzes by and still her journey continues. Her eternal quest for freedom turns into a freedom in itself, and -- by the way -- the medium of animation gives a mighty leap from the Saturday-morning ghetto to which American imaginations has confined it and shows off freedoms that live-action could never do as well.This movie is action-filled but never manic; emotional but never overwrought; thought-provoking but never airy. The unpleasant little word Surrealism comes to mind -- it's unpleasant because it often evokes elitism, self-indulgence, and confusion. But \"Millennium Actress\" is never neurotic, never smug, and always invites the audience to join in the fun of mixing up film, memory, history, and desire, in surprising ways. There are enough delightful coincidences and plot twists to entrance an admirer of Shakespeare or Dickens. The musical score is excellent. The quality of animation is excellent, and these characters have more originality, life, individuality, and heart than in many movies being made in Hollywood.\nAfter you have checked this out, look into Satoshi Kon's most recent movie \"Tokyo Godfathers.\" Then investigate the movies of Hayao Miyazaki, who is the world's greatest maker of animated films, and also Miyazaki's fellow geniuses of Studio Ghibli. 9/10",

It is a love story through and through, and a wonderful one at that. Using a remarkably original and engrossing form of storytelling the memories of the main character, Chiyoko Fujiwara, are portrayed through her films as her career, life, and memories, memories that may or may not be as they seem, blend into cornucopia of sights and story. We are guided through this woman's life, her career as a movie star, her feud with jealous older actress, her marriage to a scheming director.... and her desperate search for her love. As a girl, she meets and falls in love with a mysterious painter, a fugitive known only as \"The Man of the Key\". Her memory of this one meeting and her love for him are the heart of the film. Note how little we know or see of the painter though. It plays perfectly with how this film tells its story, and how it portrays Chiyoko's memories. I don't want to reveal exactly HOW it works here, since that would involve spoilers. But nothing is left unanswered in this film, and it never lets up its pace. It's best just to sit back and let the film tell its story.It all comes to an ending that is heartbreaking yet uplifting, and totally satisfying. This is easily one of the best films of 2003.Don't let those who call it overrated deter you from seeing this film. See it and make your own mind up.

            "content": "First and foremost, or what it appeads to be in abundance, marvel of storytelling, though that really means it all comes down to the *telling* part. The story itself, if laid out in its basic terms, might not seem so complex: an aged actress who left the industry behind decades before recounts her experiences in film, but most especially the search for a sensitive young painter she met, and how it encompasses the history of modern Japanese film... Which also means an actual \"millennium\", possibly, anyway.Yet what is complex is how Kon ties each segment together, which is something that has to be conceived of on the page and yet also takes artists who not only understand structure but know it so well they can bend it and push it. This is a master's class in how to transition from one moment to another, from one period to another, from a setting and a costume and a feeling that isnt jarring, but is instead keyed into a total dream logic.David Lynch did a similar technique (I think anyway) with Inland Empire a few years later, though that didn't have a key journey to pull it together (here it's the searching, or in Chiyoko's words \"the pursuit\"). The one thing that... I won't say concerned but something I noticed for about halfway through is that, as astonished and captivated I was by Kon's sheer daring as a filmmaker, and that he could manage to pull off not only taking the audience through these moments (maybe even shards) in time and also include the documentary filmmaker characters into the scenes and for that to somehow work too (and it almost shouldn't, like simply seeing the camcorder the man is holding could break the spell), I wasn't totally connecting with it emotionally. Like, my brain was saying\" \"this is a sort of conceptually great film, but I don't find myself as torn apart as watching Perfect Blue or even Paprika)...And then it comes out what the background of the main documentary filmmaker, Genya, interviewing Chiyoko is all about, that he used to be on set but never approached her (how could he as a lowly crew person), and it hit me that there's a greater story being told here. As much as her own obsessive quest consumed her, she might have taken for granted what an impact she made on other people, or who else did connect with her (maybe life is a series of being protected and protecting others), and in a sense it's this filmmaker's emotional story that makes the whole thing complete. I do hope to visit this again and I have the sense, like with all of Kon's films, more will be clear.For now though, Millennium Actress is fascinating as a piece of reflective Japanese film history (particularly with Setsuko Hara - and yes, I believe I saw a ground-level Ozu shot during that one scene in the house that is the film scene within the film being made), absorbing in the direction and how Kon goes about the precision of moving through a consciousness, which is a MAJOR achievement to pull off as seamlessly as this is (one minor nitpick, the music at times is a little too cheap-synth sounding), and it hits one in the heart once it comes to the conclusion.",

            "content": "\"Sennen joy\u00fb\" or \"Millennium Actress\" is a Japanese anime movie from the beginning of the new millennium, 2001, so this one had its 20th anniversary last year. Of course, it is also almost exclusively in the Japanese language and at under 1.5 hours, it is not a particularly long movie we have here. Interestingly, here we have a director who apparently was in charge of penning the original story, but not the screenplay and that is something you don't really see too often, neither with animation, nor with live action. The name is Satoshi Kon and he was still relatively young when he made this film. Unfortunately, he is no longer with us anymore, died from cancer over a decade ago, but this film he left us here is surely among his most known career efforts. I cannot really elaborate on the voice cast here except by saying that I felt they did a decent job overall, but it should not surprise anybody because the majority seemed relatively experienced already back then. Maybe they also worked on more projects than the ones you find listed here because with countries from a far distant continent you never know how complete the list is. I had the chance to watch this film yesterday on the occasion of an anime film festival at one of my local theaters. I did not regret the decision, even if I was not totally blown away by the movie and this is the first from quite a bunch I will watch over the next couple days. Let's say a few words about the plot first. We have a reporter or journalist (said chubby guy) and his cameraman who are climbing up a hill to a somewhat remote destination to reach a house in which an elderly lady lives, completely on her own with no real contact to the outside world, except her employee perhaps. This lady was once a most famous actress, but now nobody really remembers her anymore. This can also be seen through the camera guy who says something along the lines like why would anybody still care about her. That was a bit mean, but later on, he also brings in some okay comedy here and there like when he says the old guy is going wild again (not literally) or on another occasions says he is ready to retire if they make it out of a specific scenario. This was a nice reference to how the duo was in the middle of the action that took place decades ago. Like literally they were there.The more interesting character from the comedy perspective is the interviewer for sure. He is really a huge fan of the actress. Always has been, always will be. This results in some funny moments, like most of all how he comes to save her really on a few occasons, even if she (her younger self) is not too happy about it or also how he is mad at the guys who are romantic opposition, like most of all the one the woman is chasing all her life of course. But also he deeply cares for her, cries hard when he finds out she is about to die. As for the saving part, there is an unexpected turn there because this reporter guy when he was younger back then and some kind of extra at the film set where the actress was working was really there and even when there was a serious accident he kinda saved her life. The actress had not forgotten about this, but she did not make the connection that it was him in fact. It was still a bit odd because he says on one occasion they caught him standing there when nobody could have recognized it/him and he must have said it himself. Despite how humble he appears, but still of course he wants her (old version) to appreciate him, which may explain why he said it. So you could say that he had always been as infatuated with her as she had been with the mysterious young man with the painting. Well, maybe not that much. The interviewer guy is mostly in it for comedy reasons. Another pretty funny moment I liked was very brief, namely when we see the three so much inside the story decades ago that their bodies are in the same positions in the now like their characters' were back then. This makes for a funny sight for sure. Also the moment when we see the housekeeper for the first time when she opens the door and maybe we mistake her for the actress was a bit on the funny side. There's more. As you almost always see it with anime, drama is key, but there are also some moments in here where you will laugh a bit. Or smile at least. Most of the jokes are somewhat linked to the aforementioned older, chubbier male character.This film, like anime so often does, delivers fully in terms of comedy through exaggerated moments. On the more serious side,the female protagonist's idea about finding who she considers the love of her life was also well-done. Unfortunately, there I was repeatedly distracted because of the idea how they mixed up the movie back then and combined it with reality. You could never really be sure what was going on. So my thought in the end was that she somehow starred in a movie about her own life, fully based on what she had on her mind. Or who I should say. This would also fit from the perspective that she reenacts all this hoping that the man of her dreams will understand and come across it somehow somewhere. Also in terms of dramatic sequences, the film is not scared of exaggerations. The spacecraft opening pretty much did nothing for me and at some point she even ends up on what seemed to be the moon (maybe reflecting a saying that she would follow him to the moon even) and sees a painting there that could be from the one she is looking for. Also, from a completely neutral and unbiased perspective, it is a bit difficult to believe that this encounter there in the beginning could have really changed her life to such an extent. Sounds very much obsessive. But let's not go any further into detail there and stay optimistic instead and just enjoy the movie magic. Visually, I surely enjoyed the watch. I have to go back to the clashing between film and reality. Just to mention a few moments where it seemed like film in film we had the moment when the reporter guy says something like this is one of his favorite moments or even his favorite moment. Or when her character talks to her mother who as we find out was against the idea of acting from the very start and then we see and hear somebody say \"Cut!\" and realize it was just a scene they shot for a film.The revelation at the end was extremely sobering then. We find out the man that everything is about had died very briefly after the events back then, so she has indeed been chasing a spirit. When she dies in the end (not too surprising, especially with the foreshadowing how she says on one occasion she might not remember her story the next day, even if I initially thought she had Alzheimer's or something), she probably knows herself that he is deceased as well and that's why she says she can now keep searching for him on a whole new level basically, i.e. Where she is going now and still hoping they will be reunited there. This is emphasized by the fact that she also still carries the mysterious key the moment she passes. Pay attention to how the chubby comedy guy never toold her about the man's early death. You could think he would, so that one will be less of a rival, but he does not want her to lose her dream and suffer by finding the sobering truth. Like so many times with anime films, there is also a supernatural component in here, namely an old lady and we understand she is a spirit somehow and has a beverage that gives somebody (almost) eternal life, but also eternal suffering from being lovestruck as she says on two or three occasions. Near the end, it feels like that character blends together with the now old female protagonist, even if the latter was of course not a millennium old, but I did not really understand this scene and character anyway. Also who does she love and despise? Her really young self? Because she would not let go of the man of her dreams? Well, there were no regrets at all from the character herself, so a bit doubtful. Or maybe it was the voice of reason inside her head.Time to finish. I think I have made myself clear that there was stuff I liked from this film and other stuff I did not like too much, but the positive elements were more frequent overall. Music was nice too. Sometimes I felt that this film just tried to be a bit too much to be honest, to become too deep and memorable for its own good. It did not have to be like that. The story it was putting on display also could have been a huge success if they had kept it a little bit more simple. This also refers to a crucial war in Asian history that is part of the film on several occasions, especially in the first half. It was a bit of an enigma, also how they included several characters that had the same faces, so they were maybe not the exact same characters, but stood for the exact same pretty much. This refers to the one asking the girl where the bad guy went of course. On one occasion, he just follows what she said and on the second occasion he is more critical and gets out his sword and threatens her to tell the truth or he will kill her. Also with this other fairly mysterious female character I was struggling a bit. I felt she could have had her own film and story somehow, but here the way they used her as filler material I was not won over and preferred it if the film had been completely without her. That is all now. It is a good film for anime lovers who have seen a lot already, but if you are still relatively new to the genre of Asian/Japanese animation, then there are tons of other films you might want to see before this one. I still give it a thumbs-up, just not a highly enthusiastic one. Go check it out.",

As she is interviewed about her movies, she turns into the characters she played, in different eras and in different genres, and fantasy becomes confused with reality.The movie's conceit is interesting. How it is carried out, not so much. At times, the story becomes a bit too confusing. A more straight- lined screenplay would have helped.Note: Though she doesn't look terribly like her, Chiyoko Fujiwara is obviously inspired on Setsuko Hara (born in 1920), the beautiful actress who starred in many of the best films of Yasujiro Ozu (she was the understanding daughter in law in Tokyo Story), and also in some films of Akira Kurosawa and Mikio Naruse. Hara not only retired from cinema, but also has rejected any interviews for 50 years, living an apparently recluse life in Kamakura, the Tokyo suburb where many Ozu's films are set (and where Ozu himself is buried). In the movie, Fujiwara seclusion is due to an early romantic disappointment. As far as I know, no one knows the reason of Hara's disappearance from public life.Interestingly, director Satoshi Kon was born in 1963, the same year Setsuko Hara retired from cinema (and also the same year Yasujiro Ozu died). Kon unfortunately died of cancer in 2010; Setsuko Hara incredibly, is alive as of 2015.",

The result is a journey through the aging actress's memories, from her lifelong love as a child for an anti-government painter before World War II to the many famous roles she has played; the scenes change as rapidly as the actress's mind drifts, and powerful emotions from her memories trigger scene changes as we travel with her in her mind.

Kon never lets the limitations of reality interfere with his imagination and creativity. He is a consistent example of how anime can create a work of art that can't be shown through live-action films.The Millennium Actress follows Genya with his camera man, Ida, as they interview Chiyoko and learn the life story of the actress, who has since retired and secluded herself in bamboo forests and hills. The film does an amazing job of telling Chiyoko's story through the various movies she made throughout her life and showing the idea of forever chasing your dreams.The storytelling method by Satoshi Kon, where he puts Genya and Ida into the depiction of Chiyoko's past and movies, is fascinating and undoubtedly effective. Genya and Ida are like ghosts from the future looking into Chiyoko's life as she chases after the man she loves. It was refreshing to see the two interact physically and emotionally with the past world in order to \"shoot\" Chiyoko's story, as well as helping her \"bring the movies to life.\" The editing, as expected from Satoshi Kon, is phenomenal. The transitioning between Chiyoko's stories and her movies are beautifully done. The movies and characters all have recurring themes as the stories shift genre backgrounds and time periods. The constantly changing settings and stories seem to reflect Chiyoko's feelings at a particular time in her life. The depictions of Japan's historical eras all the way to the Space Age are not only well designed, but they are never too long nor too short, and they keep the viewers constantly engaged as they piece together Chiyoko's life story.As an aside, I personally think that I've never seen someone direct and edit scenes of running/chasing better than Satoshi Kon.The soundtrack also helps to bring the animation to life and works in unison with the film to draw out emotions.Overall, Millennium Actress is a touching story told in the most creative, beautiful, and elegant way. The film is sure to stay with you as you go through your own life chasing dreams.",

The interviewer brings her a gift, a key that she lost long, long ago. It opens up her memories of a man whom she helped in her youth, in the era before WWII, and we see those memories entangled in her film career. These melded flashbacks are a beautiful idea. Unfortunately, for some reason the interviewer and his cameraman come along for the trip, filming the events inside the actress' head, and eventually even participating in them. This conceit never works, and in fact the film pretty much fails just because of it. It doesn't at all help that both of these characters are constantly used for unnecessary comic relief (especially the cameraman, whose reaction shots I'm guessing Satoshi Kon found hysterical, as they're in there so frequently). If Kon had left these two characters out of the fantasy, the film might have been great. Even so, it still would have been far away from a masterpiece. The central story of the girl looking for her lost love through her memory is great, but I didn't feel like I knew her well enough to care either way.",

This is a beautifully drawn movie. It is always a terrible waste of effort to use such beauty in an undeserving story. This movie is an oversentimentalized, unnecessarily complicated, and a convoluted mess. The overlapping surreal story telling leaves the movie disjointed and uninvolving.

            "content": "(Some Minor Spoilers) Satoshi Kon's sophomore piece Sennen Joyuu (aka Millennium Actress) is a decent anime (animated) feature that is a visual wonder.  Like his previous feature Perfect Blue, Kon succeeds in transcending the boundaries of Japanese Animation to bring a love story that doesn't follow the typical norm of Japanese Anime (guns, robots and tentacles).  Millenium Actress follows the life of Chiyoko, a cute girl with a mole through the turbulent history of Japan from the Age of the Samurai, through the Feudal Wars, to the Tokugawa Age of Foreign Influence, up through the Japanese invasion of Manchuria, into the World War II Tokyo bombings and beyond. Taking its cue from Forrest Gump (1994), Chiyoko, an aspiring actress continually finds her life intertwined with the various time periods as she pursues the love of her life, a mysterious artist. Told through the eyes of a Producer documenting the life story of Chiyoko through her films and roles, Kon plays tribute to various Japanese film genres during the course of this feature.  From the Samurai epics of Akira Kurosawa, to the sappy melodramas of producer Haruki Kadokawa, to even the giant monster mayhem of Inoshiro Honda, Millennium Actress covers it all. Unfortunately the story becomes a bit tiring after a while and the `time jumping' from decade to decade becomes a bit confusing (one minute we are in Manchuria in the 1930's and then we're transported back in time to Feudal Japan with scarcely an explanation).  The love story aspect of the story is touching if a bit melodramatic as we are never really given any explanation of why Chiyoko is so enamored by the tall stranger she meets as a girl. There are funny bits of comedy that break up the somber mood however and the inventive animation will recall similar techniques used in the British Animation Feature Yellow Submarine (1968) (mixing animation with semi-realistic photos).  All in all Kon succeed in breaking the stereotypical impressions of Japanese Animation and like fellow contemporaries Otomo Katsuhiro (Akira) and Hayao Miyazaki (Spirited Away) are introducing a whole new generation of Western Audiences to Anime.",

            "content": "Reprising roles that span a millennium, an actress who longs for her first love re-enacts the drama of affirming her love for him. 'Millennium Actress' puts the theme of unrequited love in a light that is universally encompassing. It is ultimately a story of a pure-hearted character whose loving devotion to one person, innocently conceived and passionately guarded, lends itself sentience and weaves fiction with stark reality of often longing and despair. There is no doubt that this film has left me profoundly impressed. 'Millennium Actress' adopts an esoteric 'film within film' form that is disclosed in flashbacks by the actress, Chiyoko. Her highlights of her cinematography is interwoven with real events of her life, and both fiction and non-fiction aspects of her life adhere to the context of concise Japanese history. Some of these flashbacks at least in their thematic references recur more than once, and variations between them become clever plot devices that lend meaningful depth of time and space to the film.The recurring and consistently relevant symbols in the flashbacks not only pique the viewer's interest, but also anchor a means to explain the psyche of Chiyoko. Her reaction in each flashback and present to one particular entity is another indication of her perspective on her love, one of many signs of deep implication that enhances the film.The animation in the film tends to be minimalist except for a few instances where it is cast in significant passage of film (for example running), but the art direction and technique which realize various era of Japanese history and provides a fluid transition between fictional flashbacks to accounts rooted in reality is most elegantly and superbly executed. Character design is accordingly appealing, especially the depiction of Chiyoko through various stages of her life that delineates the same dignity and purity. So much so that it seems almost as if Chiyoko itself transcends to some abstract form of ideal love, only unrequited, and therefore something of great potential but not wasted; since it essentially defies time and space, as allegorically portrayed in her various film roles.The director Satoshi Kon commented in his interview on his pleasure with the music, which seems to be electronically assembled with a lot of repetition. It sometimes stands out as a bit overbearing and idiosyncratic, yet considering the nature of theme from the film it does not detract from the overall viewing experience. Only note of letdown, if there is any point to it at all, comes from my personal disdain for a rather melancholy sequence at the end. Yet, a conventional Hollywood resolution would not apply here. As a footnote to my rambling, and for which I must apologize, I should add that 'till death do us part' could not be more opposite of what this film professes.9/10",

He litters her path with earth-shattering events perpetually reducing her world to rubble. Through it all Chiyoko perseveres, acknowledging in her final moments that what has motivated her perhaps more than love of a man is love of the chase itself. The animation style Kon uses is deliberately old-fashioned, with still frames and sequences where nothing but a character's mouth moves. There's more than enough complexity in the structure of the story. Simple, sometimes stark lines and colors that echo the reality on screen combine with beautiful backgrounds to create a complex and elegant meditation on the power of dreams and images, the need to forge them, and the life-changing impact of finding your own star to follow.",

Truth and fiction intertwine in the telling of that particular saga, with personal memoirs stirred into various scenes from her best-loved screen performances. The result is a flighty, dreamlike atmosphere, a general easing in and out of the present that doesn't always follow a linear train of thought. It operates with a soft touch, which matches the understated nature of our aging narrator; smoothly straddling genres and decades en route to a destined meeting with a lost love.That puts it on common thematic ground with both Perfect Blue and Paprika (Kon's 2006 swan song), which both toyed with perception and the meeting ground between internal and external realities.

            "content": "I don't really have much good to say about this thing; I consider it to be highly overrated.  Sure the animation is interesting, but so are many others in this genre these days.  The story reminded me of extremely annoying off-Broadway-type dramatic plays that I've seen in the past, where they attempt a trendy non-linear kalidescopic story-within-story narrative, which ends up mostly confusing and alienating the audience.  Its not really made for adults, and requires suspension of disbelief on so many levels that it eventually falls apart.  And after you've slogged all the way through to the end - there's no ending!Basically the movie uses the paper-thin story as an excuse for a lengthy animated romp through a bunch of emulated scenes from various periods of classic Japanese films.  This is actually kind of interesting if you've seen some of the films, and I think that maybe I even saw a schoolroom-scene from \"Twenty-Four Eyes\" quoted.It also keeps lightly touching on the extremely sensitive subject of Japanese politics of the 30's leading up to WWII, kind of like a tongue constantly probing a sore tooth.  It was certainly news to me that there were noble left-wing freedom-fighters heading for Manchuria during the Japanese invasion and occupation, and I wondered how much of that was revisionist wishfull thinking on the part of the film-makers.In any case, the average American viewer will have absolutely no functioning knowledge of Japanese history or classic Japanese films, and I can't for the life of me figure out what is left for them to latch onto; I guess they just like romanticized action cartoons featuring spunky girls with big eyes on a quest.  It is probably way to much to hope that viewers might be motivated to go and watch one of the timeless stunning Japanese classic films themselves, from directors like Kurosawa, Mizoguchi, Ozu, etc.This is yet another excellent example of the almost total meaninglessness of the IMDB \"user-ratings\" number; its a sad, sick joke that an inconsequential trifle like this gets an \"8\", ranking it up with \"Citizen Kane\" let alone \"Lord of the Rings\".",

            "content": "My introduction to the works of Satoshi Kon was far from smooth. The first of his films I saw while going through his oeuvre was \"Perfect Blue\", which I found pretentious and clumsy when it dropped inner conflict in favour of being a slasher film. Because of this, I was rather unimpressed when his next film, \"Millennium Actress\", presented itself as another portrayal of the subjectivity of memory. How glad I am to say that \"Millennium Actress\" is focused, nuanced, deeply touching and one of the best animated films I have seen.The story about two documentary producers visiting a retired actress somewhat reminiscent of Setsuko Hara starts off a little awkward when the duo physically enters the world of her memories as she tells her story, but by regularly cutting back to the interview, it is suggested the visualisation may be part of the actress' imagination. \"Suggested\" is the right word; there is a masterful balance between what information is given and what is left to the viewer to interpret.As she recounts a defining episode from her youth, the meeting with a rogue artist with whom she falls in love, a somewhat sudden transition is made to her signing on as an actress in her pursuit of the man. It is only the first in a series of transitions of increasing smoothness between her private life and the roles she has played over the years (in films lovingly designed to resemble the styles of Kurosawa and Ozu among others), up to the point that both of them become one. This blurring of the boundary between the two has both psychological and psychological implications:Firstly, it represents the merging of memories in old age, as only the essential attributes remain, with the hunt for the artist, rivalry with an older actress she surpasses in popularity and earthquakes serving as leitmotivs.Secondly, it could be interpreted in an auteurist manner, as embodying the relation between the artist and his work. Interestingly, the older of the interviewers continually plays the lone hero who saves the protagonist in her films, and as it is revealed he has been in love with her for many years and even saved her in real live, it is implied his own memories and fantasies are visualised as well. This would imply \"Millennium Actress\" to be about more than the fragmented memories of an old lady alone, possibly a form of collective conscious, or a metaphor for the nature of interpretation, or an account of how a person's story is inevitably changed by the auteur - in this case the producer - who transcribes it.But all of this is interpretation. It would not do \"Millennium Actress\" justice to only praise the technical aspects of its narrative. There is great sadness to be found in the life of the actress, but the film's beauty lies in the underplaying of it, in the way she copes with her problems and reflects on her experiences in her old age. The filmmakers, who effectively serve as comic reliefs for most of the film, provide a necessary counterbalance, whilst the older one ads yet another dimension to the multi-layered narrative.What an incredible loss Satoshi Kon's untimely death has been. Especially considering that \"Millennium Actress\" was only his second feature, it is astonishing what levels of refinement and insight he could express through the medium of animation. This film will stand as one of his masterpieces. Not only for the profound interpretation that can be given to its deliberate ambiguity, but also for the touching, and deeply satisfying narrative experience the film provides.",

            "content": "Satoshi Kon's films tend to have ambitious narrative structures. This one, \"Millennium Actress\", is no different. It revolves around Genya Tachibana, a documentary director who tracks down Chiyoko Fujiwara, a Japanese movie star he's long admired from afar. He finds her living in the countryside, now a recluse, having retired from acting some 30 years ago.Much of the film watches as Chiyoko recounts her life's story for Tachibana. Her many accomplishments and achievements are then tied to a young man whom she once briefly met and fell in love with. Tachibana, it turns out, spent much of her life attempting to track this man down, not knowing that he died shortly after their first encounter. The film then becomes an elaborate metaphor for a mankind which is doomed to perpetually chase after idealised, objects of desire. The unbridgeable gap between fantasy and reality then becomes the engine which both inspires all human progress, and is responsible for an intrinsic human Lack, an unquenchable discontentment. Achievement, then, is paradoxically tied to an inability to quite achieve. Typifiying the film's psychological complexity, \"Millennium Actress\" is structured as a grand chase, Chiyoko's reality is repeatedly traumatically interrupted whenever she nears her lover (on a psychological level, humans tend to self-sabotage, or self-destruct the closer they get to Desire), the film is symbolically framed by giant rocket-ships, mankind's capabilities limitless so long as there exists a gap to be bridged, and Tachibana's long-distance love for Chiyoko echoes Chiyoko's own love for the stranger.Whilst the film's first hour may seem disjointed, shapeless and even dull, a powerful ending helps bring things into focus. This ending is almost ruined by an unnecessary line of dialogue, given to Chiyoko, which spells out the film's central theme. It's a heavy-handed and unneeded line. Elsewhere the film uses Chiyoko's life story as a means of trawling through Japan's own political and cinematic history (lots of allusions to famous Japanese films and events).7.9/10 \u2013 Worth two viewings.",

Actress hit me less hard than any of his other work, which was either more profoundly moving, more inventive structurally, or just more immediately disturbing. That's not to say there's anything wrong with the film, which is a perfectly nice story told in a unique way. It's about a small film crew that goes to interview an old woman who suddenly quit her successful acting career thirty years earlier. She tells them her life story, and things quickly become interesting when you see how exactly that story will be shown. The producer and cameraman are thrust into the past, watching the early events of her life actually play out, and once she starts acting things get really interesting as things are seen through the lens of her various roles.This isn't actually happening of course, as they're still there listening to her in her living room. It's just a really clever way to do flashbacks that turn it from a boring trope into something unusual and occasionally fascinating. It's sort of funny that this and Tokyo Godfathers were the last two Kon creations that I saw, because they're smack in the middle of his career so far and fairly non-insane, which led to a narrow view of what his range as a filmmaker really is. Actress isn't without some issues, as there were times when I found myself wondering what the point actually was. Things pick up once certain connections are revealed though, and the ending is as poignant and beautiful as you could ever hope from a story like this. It's sort of predictable in a way, but only because it's so fitting. Definitely worth seeing.",

It's a story about an aging actress who reminisces about her life as a young film star in the early 20th century Japan. The tale is told largely through flashbacks where memories mix with reality and dreams.And it is utterly gorgeous. The whole film looks fantastic, especially how they managed to capture the different eras and genres of film making with slightly changing animation styles. The only other studio or director that can in any way compete with this level of quality is Studio Ghibli's Hayao Miyazaki. It's that good. I also really like the way the framing story is mixed with the smaller flashback segments, with the interviewer putting in as different heroic characters. It's a tale about movies, but also about her personal struggle to find meaning in her life and to reach towards her past and lost chances. All the flashbacks intertwine, making it one of those film you almost have to see twice to fully get.The voice acting is also topnotch, the character designs are fantastic and even though the way the story is told is almost better than the story itself - journey over the destination - it's not a bad story at all, dealing heavily with Japan's film history.Millennium Actress is a treat for all that appreciate non-conventional storytelling, deeply layered characters and gorgeous animation.

            "content": "Millennium Actress is a stunningly beautiful piece of animation.The movie begins by showing a pair of documentary makers, an old interviewer and his younger cameraman, who have been given the privilege of interviewing one of Japans biggest female movie-stars ever, Chiyoko Fujiwara, about 30 years after she unexpectedly retired from film-making. As they start the interview they are shown the actress's story from two angles - her real life, and the movies she has made. They are surprised in finding that those two don't differ as much as one might think.Following the celebrated actresses life is wonderful, albeit a bit hard to follow on the first viewing. From Manchuria in the 1930's following her real life the movie suddenly jumps to feudal Japan and one of Chiyoko's movies in a completely different setting, after that to another movie set in yet another era and a different genre. We are shown action, drama, science fiction and horror, often without any narration where the real characters can explain what is really happening on- and off-stage as other movies have thought us to expect - this most likely leads to some (or many) viewers not really understanding that what we see in Chiyokos movies at the same time is her real life story, in turn perhaps leading to a sense of unfulfilment. That \"Millennium Actress\" had no real story, when it absolutely has and the story is a great one. Director Satoshi Kon plays with us, using refined techniques from his previous movie \"Perfect Blue\" in binding the two lives of Chiyoko together and making us question what we are watching. Is it one of her movies or a scene from her real life? Once again Kon proves himself to be a one of the worlds best directors.Now, if the two different perspectives doesn't make it complicated enough, the interviewer and his camera man also get to join in on the fun - appearing in the memories and films of Chiyoko's life. While sometimes being just right, as well as underlining the intimate knowledge the interviewer has of her films, the comic relief they are supposed to yield at other times can distract from the scenes themselves. It's a small nitpick, especially considering how they bring the audience closer to what's happening in the movie and really lifting those killer scenes.And speaking of scenes, Millennium Actress has a ton of great ones. Beautiful scenes that will stay with you for a long time, brought to life by exceptional animation - fully exploiting every advantage animation has over traditional cinema in creating an animated movie like no other. The animation is further complemented by Susumu Hirasawas wonderful music, music that breathes of life and magnifically portrays the young actress's life as she progresses through life.With a wonderful story, humane characters, superb direction and beautiful animation, Millennium Actress is one of those films that simply gets to you.

            "review_title": "An Amalgam of Self-Reference (SPOILERS)",
            "content": "Satoshi Kon's latest film Millennium Actress is even more of a pleasure to watch than his first film, Perfect Blue, not only from a narrative perspective but also from a self- referential one.  The film focuses on an actress and an obsessed director that is making a documentary on her life in movies.  The self-reference begins here: the actress is based on an actual person and the director in the movie is none other than Satoshi Kon himself, extrapolated only in his exaggerated emotions.A review of the movie elsewhere likened the movie to James Cameron's Titanic in the sense that the viewer experiences the main portion of the story through the old woman's flashbacks.  While this is accurate, Millennium Actress works on several more levels by diverging from Titanic's structure in several ways, the first of which being the way the director and his cameraman interact with her memories.  Both are not specters of observation unable to affect the environment as in conventional flashback movies. The director, so obsessed with the actress, tries to save her from peril in various scenarios.  The cameraman as a character is not necessary for the narrative; he merely exists as a constant reminder that we are viewing a movie.  Whenever the movie `lapses' into what may be a genuine dramatic scene, the illusion is stripped away to reveal set, actors, and crew.  In many scenes the probing, voyeuristic eye of the portable camera upends the drama.  We wonder exactly what the camera is capturing, if anything at all.The beginning of the movie shows one of the final scenes.  As a viewer we have no reference point and it seems like the picture will have a science fiction setting.  This is denied when the camera pulls back to an editing room where the director is watching the film.  He lets the tape rewind, and we are treated to a rapid look at the rest of the film that gives a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu when the scenes are watched in forward motion.The actress is versatile in her roles, performing in various period pieces that pay tribute to Eastern history and cinema.  In the narrative outside of her acting career, she is desperately trying to locate a lover to return a key he has given her.  A recurring character with a scar on his face reappears in various periods, in a state of perpetual hunt for the young man.  Her movie life enlarges the struggle; every scene relates to finding him before the man with the scar does.  Since we are viewing the memories of unrequited love from the old woman's perspective, the magnitude of the passion is most likely heightened.  To the woman, the memories could be much more powerful than the actual encounter.  The encounter is a very short scene, with no real motive for the love; it is love in its purest form, not necessary for explaining by the film.  It is a raw emotional sensation that will be unachievable when the director is finished with his documentary.The pacing of the film never slows; in usual Western fare the second act's forward motion is broken by a period of low action before final rising action to the climax. Millennium Actress surpasses this with an unending slew of scenes that serve to pull the viewer deeper into the cinematic experience as our interest is traditionally waning in other films.  The climax consists of fast, matched-cut edits as the narrative comes to its cohesive ending.  This film has renewed my faith in cinema.",

And I wasn't disappointed, though if I would rate this movie amongst the others I've seen, then my preference will be in reverse chronological order, not that Millennium Actress is no good, but you do see the scaling of new heights in the newer works.I'm quite amazed at how a single theme (at least to me) managed to weave itself into a compelling story, and one which paid homage to the history of Japan, and to Japanese films. The actress in the title refers to Chiyoko Fujiwara (voiced by three different actresses - Miyoko Shoji, Mami Koyama and Fumiko Orikasa), and chronicles the story of her career. As such, we get to see her in various characters and costumes, in different genres set in different eras, like the Samurai films, science fiction, romance dramas, and even monster movies. Now a senior citizen who has since retired from the limelight, she's being tracked down for an interview by Genya Tachibana (Shozo Izuka) and his cameraman Ida Kyoji (Masaya Onosaka), as she's the icon for a movie studio which is being torn down. But there's more to Genya's intentions of just speaking to her, and that secret in which he has will form the basic crux of the story.To some, it might be groundhog day narrative style as events get repeated, although in different reel eras. It's about chasing after a loved one, one who has disappeared, and about your relentless pursuit, never to give up for that glimmer of hope, for that pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. In many aspects, there's a lot of reel life imitating real, and the presentation style is definitely a notch in the direction of class, having interpolate Genya and Ida into the memories of Chiyoko as they learn first hand the events that she encounters, and relive those memories in the form of the movies she had starred in. In this manner of skillfully manipulating images and colour, the movie becomes layered in multiple fashion, and is quite innovative, rather than telling the story in a flat out chronological style.The story nevertheless remains immensely touching, and bittersweet as well, particularly when a key secret is revealed, and you find yourself having to hold back that tear from coming out of your eye, especially when you have experienced a similar, relentless chase for something that you do not know what the outcome is. As always, the movie is richly animated with deep background details that you do not keep your eyes off the screen, and definitely deserves multiple re-watchings. Definitely highly recommended.",

An ageing actress recounts her life to a pair of filmmakers who seek to reconcile their love of her work with the truth of her being. A key unlocks the most important thing and the memories come flooding back, swallowing the documentarians whole and enveloping them in a dream-like montage of far away places and long ago times. The longing of a lost love echoes across a lifetime, framing every moment as it reaches across the decades and sews itself into the very fabric of time. With a melancholic edge and an abstract aesthetic, this enigmatic picture racks the brain as often as it stirs the heart. It's touching in its own ever-so-slightly intangible way. Once you realise what it's doing, it becomes abundantly clear that this is a clever and unique concept that explores quite a bit more than it initially seems to. It's relatively deep stuff, brought to life with beautiful animation and confidently unconventional editing. It isn't quite as fun or emotionally resonant as it could have been, but it's a solid and distinct effort. To be honest, there isn't anything quite like it.",

After watching Perfect Blue 97 times(almost) and thinking of having an idea how to interpret this movie, I moved on to Millennium Actress, which is, in my opinion, more straightforward, but richer, more poetic and more inspired, don't get me wrong, both movies are awesome, but very different. To give you an idea, Kon moved from a Alfred Hitchcock inspired movie, to something GREATLY more inspired by Orson Wells.That's one of the main interesting thing about Millennium Actress. It's an upside down Citizen Kane. I can't believe it's not a \"referenced\" in the \"movie connections\". First of all it's about the life of a great public person, but now it's a women, an actress, then there is an interesting connection between the present moment & the past trought an narrator, BUT unlike Kane, she's alive and the journalist has the key(in every sense of the term)...and we know the key of the story in the end and not the actress(opposite in Citizen Kane).Where Kon innovates and distant himself from the copycats is his BLENDING of film past, real past and present moment. You go up into Chiyoko's past, into her film-making and past life without understanding where to draw the line. Funny thing, Kon presents glimpses of Japanese cinema past in Chiyoko's career. She plays into Kurosawa like movies and is seen in Godzilla and Ozu like productions. Pretty interesting. There is also winks to Stanley Kubrick's work.Every cinephile should see it, like they all seen Citizen Kane.",

            "content": "Last year's blockbuster 'Wall-E' has probably made the ultimate demonstration that the animation film genre can express anything that actors film can do and more. 'Millennium Actress' is made a few years before 'Wall-E' and may have benefited from less technical expertise but it's consistency, sensitivity, and reverence to the history of the Japanese cinema make it memorable and most remarkably thing, this animation film is one of those fabulous stories about cinema actors that made so many great movies especially in the American cinema.The story of a TV anchor and his cameraman visiting a retired actress who lives in seclusion many decades after quitting film-making immediately reminds the story of life the fabulous Setsuko Hara, the star of the Japanese screen in the 40s and 50s and preferred actress of director Yasujiro Ozu. The reporter brings the actress a souvenir from her old life, a key which is related to the story of the love of her life, a key to her past life and career that triggers the retelling of her memories in a filmed interview. The series of flashbacks that follow are not simple episodes in her life, but scenes and cinema quotes from her films, and actually from the real films that marked the history of the Japan cinematography. The reporter and the cameraman turn from listeners of the story to witnesses of the scenes and then to participants, the time plans mix and the characters duplicate in time and age, but the characters stay the same in the different film genres and the central line of the story is the same - the seek for love, the endless longing, the perennial sentiment of what starts as a romantic first feelings of a teenager to become a story of love that transcends time and film genres.The quality of the animation and the beauty of the drawings inspired from the Japanese comics are being put in the service of honoring the peak creations of the more respected Japanese film industry. It is a way of saying that they belong to the same cultural roots, and that the more popular form of art honors its elder tradition. The film however is beautiful and moving beyond its cinematographic history elements. Some of the IMDb comments suggest that the director denied being inspired from the life of Setsuko Hara, but the animated character in the film looks exactly like one of the heroines Setsuko brought to screen, and as viewers we love her as one. The story is direct and moving, it tells about the love of a lifetime. Such simple moving stories make the material of many great works of art and this film comes very close to being one of them.",

It is also curious to learn of her reasons for going into show business, which turn out to be more than just fame and fortune, with her career flourishing in ways she could have never anticipated and ultimately could not control. The film was apparently inspired by the life of Setsuko Hara (star of 'Late Spring' and several other Ozu films) who withdrew from acting in her early forties to never appear on film again, but the protagonist here could also be related to Greta Garbo and indeed anyone who has ever chosen to leave life in the public eye behind.

This is second only to Paprika - his final film - for me personally.It involves a documentary filmmaker interviewing an elderly actress about her career and life, and from there, things unfold in a truly unique way. Even if I didn't connect with the story or characters 100%, I loved the way the story was told, blending \"present day\" interviews, past events from the actress's life, and scenes from the movies she acted in, all seamlessly intercutting and intertwined in odd and interesting ways that are hard to describe. But the main thing is they're cool and very engaging to watch on screen.While each individual scene could technically be pulled off in live action pretty easily, I don't feel like they could be edited together the way they are in this, were it not animated.As for the animation itself, it's great, as is the music. I also loved all the homages to the various genres that have been popular throughout the history of Japanese cinema.It's a super unique movie and an always interesting one, even though it didn't quite hit me as hard emotionally as I think it might have wanted to (might just be a me thing of course).",

In a way, the greater part of his work is like the remixes that he puts in his soundtracks--familiar but different every time, probably because of the pro-cinematic style he incorporates. Here, an actress chases her true love throughout her entire film career, including science fiction, samurai, family drama, war, costume drama, and even big monster genres. There's some allusions to Kurosawa that look almost rotoscoped, and there are other things that don't seem like they could be in any other movie at all.The fun part is how he builds up to the final chase sequence. Some of the more direct cut-on-actions that the videographer commentates on, for instance, are awkward and almost funny (especially BECAUSE of the commentary), but things get intense near the end when her entire career and the subconscious reality behind them all converge into a single instance of emotion. However, long before the movie is over the final line is already sort of understood by the viewer: the chase is more fun than the actual getting. It's interesting watching a movie where you don't really want the character to get what she wants in the end, because she already has it...I like the idea of a documentary about an actress turning her roles into reality. I'd like to see that done in a non-animated movie too, sometime. Afterall, when it comes down to it, Kon doesn't really want to see the difference between fiction and reality--he's mighty comfortable letting them coexist on converging planes of existence. If the movie were even MORE from the perspective of the camera man, even first person, it'd be all the more surreal.--PolarisDiB",

Truth and fiction intertwine in the telling of that particular saga, with personal memoirs stirred into various scenes from her best-loved screen performances. The result is a flighty, dreamlike atmosphere, a general easing in and out of the present that doesn't always follow a linear train of thought. It operates with a soft touch, which matches the understated nature of our aging narrator; smoothly straddling genres and decades en route to a destined meeting with a lost love. That puts it on common thematic ground with both Perfect Blue and Paprika (Kon's 2006 swan song), which both toyed with perception and the meeting ground between internal and external realities.

Be it a shoot-'em-up actioner, a swashbuckling fantasy, an alien-invasion sci-fi or a cowboy western, nothing can prove a constraint to the power of love in cinema. I guess one of the main reasons for that is its ability to ground the most wild and fanciful stories in reality because it evokes emotion in such a way the viewer comes to identify with the characters and invest in the story readily. Satoshi Kon captures that notion here to perfection, blurring the logical line between reality and fiction, forcing us to completely rely on what we feel as we're letting the movie wash over us.\"The Key\" is a catalyst that opened the flood-gates of memories of the eponymous actress, letting these memories rush out in flashback scenes the two documentarians interviewing Chiyoko are literally pulled into them. The cheekily innovative gimmick of making them intervene in her quasi-fictional stories added a sense of meta and light relief that imbued the film with much needed breeziness. In addition, that made us pry to Chiyoko's both inner and outer feelings throughout her cinematic and love-pursuing journey, which are chronicled while a glimpse of the golden age of Japanese cinema backdropping the scenery. That said, Millennium Actress perhaps runs too short to make a lasting impact on me, and the frenetic pace doesn't help either. I'm sure, however, that a rewatch can make me pump my rating up.\"I can't remember!Not even his face!I loved him so much.Now I can't remember his face!\"The story moulds the agonizing feelings of longing in memory vessels that would preserve love so long as youthfulness lasts. But youthfulness withers, allowing memories to fade away. Here comes the struggle that's even harder than the life-time seeking of love: the struggle of desperately trying to hold onto memories of lost love while your aging mind failing you. That's when you even find it hard to wistfully lament your most precious loss! From here on, the story takes a huge metaphysical leap, culminating in an ending that emphasizes the immortality of love and cinema. A fitting ending to a singular ode to all that we've lost but refuse to forget.",

The gift opens up Chiyoko's long forgotten memories, and she begins telling her story to the documentarians.\"Millennium Actress\" is a 2001 entry to the Anime industry, and earned the Grand Prize of the Japan Agency of Cultural Affairs Media Arts Festival; truly a film that rivals the success of Hayao Miyazaki's \"Spirited Away.\" This particular film became a landmark in the anime industry, due to its innovative and clever use of visuals that brought the art of story-telling to a transcendental level. As Chiyoko tells her life's stories to the two gentlemen, the true meaning of \"Millennium Actress's\" title materializes, as her tale is masked over by 1,000 years of Japanese history. On top of that, it even makes tasteful homages to classic Japanese films that are understandably, but regretfully lost on audiences outside of Japan. This mesh of history and present creates a surreal experience that intentionally blurs the ever elusive line between Chiyoko's reality, and the fictional characters in the films she acted in. It effectively established an aura of whimsy that invariably enshrouds viewers who tag along with Chiyoko's remembrances of her most joyous and heartbreaking times.Though it is an enjoyably colorful movie on its own, it is full of symbolism and history that encourages the viewer to engage in thought alongside it the entire way through. This film wasn't intended to simply be stared at on a screen; it actively reaches out to its audience, pulls them straight into its world, and engages viewers in critical thought alongside Chiyoko as she continues the discovery of herself, as well as the true meaning of love and freedom. Every flaw can plainly be seen in her character that invokes questions about her happiness in life, and by extension, our own.This is a must see film for animation enthusiasts, as it has clearly earned its place as a renowned classic. The film's presentation quality proves that Satoshi Kon's film crew paid sincere attention to the tools they had, creating an extraordinary woven set of stories, sounds, visuals, and drama that invites viewers on a seemingly innocent journey towards the discovery of \"the most important thing in the world.\"",

            "content": "A young woman is cursed by a spirit to live a millennium chasing a man she's never known and has only seen once. There are 4 archetypes in the story: a tall dark stranger, a young naive wistful girl, an older jealous woman, and a caring brave 'nice guy' in the friend zone. These characters reappear over & over throughout her lives both past & future. The 4th archetype is reminiscent of Forest Gump. In the present, she is an actress retelling her memories to a small documentary crew who are drawn into her past, present, and future lives. The scenes transition between eras of Japanese history artistically but abruptly and without logic or reason. Scenes also transition between eras and present movie sets without real rhyme or reason. This is similar to the style of Mr. Nobody. (Some reviews said it could not be made live action but was done effectively with that movie.) There are some questions in the movie that do not get answers. The story telling is very artistic and unique, more so than Deadpool. I'm quite OK with artistic movies (Princess Kaguya), but the scene jumping was a bit too illogical and without motivation. I tend to prefer a bit more coherent stories. (I also believe I gave Mr. Nobody a 7.)",

            "content": "In what was my introduction to the work of Satoshi Kon, I skipped the obvious choices and, due to a recommendation from a very dear friend, I ended up immersing myself in this work of art. I say immersing because watching this feels almost like a psychotropic experience. I had already heard about the often non-linear storytelling style of Satoshi Kon, but, even more so, about his unique editing style. Still, I was not prepared to how effective it could be. It is amazing how his groundbreaking and rule defying techniques can make so much sense in a scene. I am talking obviously, about the cuts on movement, the amazing match cuts and so on, and so on. I am no cinema expert but, if his other movies are done with the same sagacity, the man sure deserves a place in the textbooks.\nOne might think that a director with such animation style could afford to be sloppy sometimes regarding the plot, using the visuals as a crutch. Nonetheless, the plot is still elegantly done, following a tireless search for something Chiyoko was deemed to never attain. Always at risk to slipping to 'clich\u00e9', Satoshi Kon managed to keep it original and engaging (except for that ending line, no one really needed that to be said). Praise also to the character of the documentary producer, which manages to escape the 'obsessed admirer' role to have an impactful influence in the story. While, at the beginning, I found the tenuous concept of reality and the constant intromissions of the 'documentary crew' somehow off putting, I came to appreciate it in the course of the movie.\nThe soundtrack also fits nicely, but is not something to go crazy about.To wrap it up, I cannot go without stressing my absolute favorite thing about this movie: the nods to some of the great Japanese directors like Kurosawa and Ozu. Seeing directors paying such respectful homages to their counterparts never fails to bring a smile to my face.",

            "content": "Maybe the greatest movie actress of Japan - some considered her the Century Actress - born at the beginning at the twenties, starting to play in her teens, spanning a prodigious career over three decades of movie history, to vanish at her peak! She gave weak reasons (or no reasons at all) for her decision to leave the public life; her anonymity has been total ever since.Decades have passed, new generations of public came and little by little the great actress was forgotten. Of course, film critics are still mentioning her name when analyzing the movies of the forties and fifties; but they are talking at the past, as of a person who lived in a bygone era.Has everybody forgotten her? No, of course not, there will be always people passionate for her movies and fascinated by her personality: people dreaming to find her and to tell her their fascination.And here is the place where Sennen joy\u00fb (Millennium Actress) starts: a devoted fan succeeds to find her and she accepts to be interviewed by him. As they start talking, the past comes back in force and overwhelms the present. Scenes from all her movies, and what happened behind the scenes: she was playing the lead role, he was just a young assistant by then. The present is no more, their memories join in a unique flow. The old star and her fan live again the past, this time the meaning of those moments comes enriched: she is now aware of his presence on the plateau. Actually the past is not repeated: the force of their memories makes the past a continuous moment, time looses any significance. There is no more a succession of moments; there are only moments charged with emotional value, that remain forever.Kon Satoshi is an Anim\u00e9 film director,which was fortunate for this movie, as he kept this way total control over the story and was able to blur past and present, life on the plateau and life outside it; more than that, he was able this way to change completely the image style of each reenacted scene in accordance to the specific period; Jidaigeki movies from the twenties and early thirties, propaganda movies from the period of Manchurian occupation, dramas from late forties and fifties, Sci-Fi movies from the sixties on. What resulted was a fascinating history of Japanese cinema in its most significant moments! Is the feminine personage in the movie an allusion to Setusko Hara? The director did not confirm this suggestion. Nevertheless I would say yes, for many reasons, the main reason being that for me it is only Setsuko Hara who deserves to be named the Millennium Actress.",
