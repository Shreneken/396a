            "content": "Waking Life is among a handful of films (Woyzeck, Magnolia, The Passion of Anna) that really frustrate me, because as much as I love them I can't necessarily recommend them to everyone. There are certain films for which one needs to be on a certain wavelength to enjoy, no matter how cultured or intelligent. This film is best for those who have sat around thinking about the big questions in life for long periods of time, dying for someone to talk to about them. I guess Waking Life isn't about those questions so much as it's about the people who are asking them, the wonderers, the thinkers, and especially the dreamers. For those who can appreciate it, it's a cleansing experience, one of a purity and beauty that has no equal in the films I've been fortunate enough to see.",

            "content": "This is one of the most thought provoking films I've ever seen. It's also visually stunning and perfectly acted: every single one of these people seem to be just giving their own opinions as if you were overhearing/having a meaningful conversation with them. We can chalk this up to the genius of Linklater who over the years has shown not only the pretentiously humorous coffee house crowd cliches but also the searching, often deeply insightful side of our generation that the media overlooked when we were dubbed slackers. In films he has written: \"Slacker\" and \"Before Sunrise\" and in his films of stage plays Bogosian's brilliant, Chekhovian \"SubUrbia\" and the faintly melodramatic \"Tape\", Linklater has always been fascinated with the question of what we should doing with our lives. Our responsibility is to contribute something lasting and meaningful to our society. But what exactly is that? Where and when should I do it? Who with? How do I know if I've really found it? Why is it so important again, anyway? I saw this movie for the first time late last night and 5 minutes before it started I had fallen asleep and was hoping I'd be able to make it all the way through the film. From the first frame I was riveted and completely awake and remained so even after it was over; contemplating all the myriad viewpoints the film had thrown at me.This movie is so exciting and bursting with ideas that I'm going to buy the DVD as soon as I possibly can and watch it over and over trying to absorb it all.See this film. It will remind you of how thrilling it is to be an active thinking, feeling member of the human race.",

It is not only one of the very best films to be released in 2001, but also one of the most thought provoking films I've ever seen.  Watching it is an amazing experience in itself. \tIts visual style is stunning.  Digital animation is put over live action actors in a style that every scene is like some kind of a post-modern painting that you would see in an art gallery. \tThe story follows a young man by the name of Wiley Wiggins and his encounters with many interesting people.  He listens to their thoughts and theories, but doesn't really understand why.  He is in an on-going lucid dream that takes him to odd, but fascinating encounters with people and places. \tI absolutely loved this film.  It is one of those rare films that takes you away from your seat and into a world that you are placed right in the middle of and when it ends, the only thing you can say is, `Wow!'",

            "review_title": "Beautiful sloppiness; an excellent mistake",
            "content": "Imagine a man who shows up for a job interview wearing a torn T-shirt, sneakers, and sunglasses. The manager interviewing him can't believe that someone would have the audacity to show up like this but he can't help being impressed by this guy's intelligence, charm, sensitivity, and work-ethic...skills which every employer desires in a potential employee. Well, \"Waking Life\" is like that smart but sloppy man showing up for the job interview, and the employer is us, the audience.I've read the other User Comments and the common complaint among those who hate this movie is the fact that it meanders, is filled with seemingly endless, tedious philosophical ramblings, and has no characters we can connect with in a deep, emotional way. And to those people I have to say this: You're absolutely right. This movie is all of those things. It also happens to be one of the most exciting, inspiring, eye-opening and haunting experiences I've had at the movies in a long time.For me, the movie ultimately succeeds in spite of its long, non-cinematic, abstract discussions because it's a movie about a DREAM. And aren't dreams the ultimate abstraction? How can you make a movie about something as abstract as dreams without also being abstract to some degree? This is a legitimate case of the Form matching the Content. And I truly feel that this movie accurately--very accurately-- illustrates the landscape of dreams. Some people have felt that the rotoscoping animation grates after a while but I feel that it's probably the movie's greatest asset: the live-action painted over by computer animation results in images that look both real and unreal, that look more to be based on something that's real than being real itself--and that's exactly how images look and feel in dreams (at least in my dreams).That said, I won't go so far as saying this movie is a cinematic masterpiece, as some people have asserted. Long, static, philosophical discussions and a bunch of Talking Heads don't really belong in a movie, which needs developed characters and a consistent conflict that runs like a thread throughout the story. On that level, the movie falls short.\nAt its best, though, the movie works on two levels: On one level, it's the story about a guy who's trying to \"wake up\" from a metaphorical sleep of ignorance and unawareness. On a second level, which is more speculative and ambiguous than the first, it's the story about a guy who has just died and is experiencing nearly 120 minutes of post-mortal consciousness.\nSome might disagree with the second story possibility, but I personally believe that it's the movie's Real story. There are some hints scattered throughout the film which seem to indicate that Wiley Wiggins' character is dead (spoilers ahead): 1. early in the movie, right before Wiggins gets hit by the car, he gets a ride in a boat-car which has a skull-and-crossbones banner hanging from it; 2. there are three scenes where Wiggins rides on a train, which implies that some kind of transitional Transportation is taking place--he's moving from one realm (life) to another (death); 3. the film starts in the daytime and gradually builds to nighttime where it ends--in literature (which this movie alludes to several times), night has always represented Death;  4. in the scene where Wiggins tells the red-headed woman that he believes he's dreaming, he ends by saying \"But this dream is different--it's almost as if I'm being prepared for something\": RIGHT AFTER he says that, we see him briefly on the train again, and right after that, we see him on a bridge which, like the train, represents transition, a change from one state to another;  5. in the Night scenes at the end, random people pass by Wiggins, making cryptic comments about death (i.e.- \"Kiergegaard's last words were 'sweep me up'.\"): it's as if these people are trying to tell the Wiggins that he's dead.Seen from this latter perspective, the movie plays almost like a tragedy: a man, about to die, looks back on his life (just like the old woman whom Julie Delpy mentions early in the movie) and realizes that he has been none other than an observer, a watcher, a listener rather than a Doer. And by the time he realizes this, it's too late--he's pulled into the sky/Eternity/Death.",

            "content": "Waking Life is almost like a compilation of short films as opposed to one complete full length feature. But then the film insists repeatedly that there is a logic to it, dream logic. This, however, could even be circumspect. It's really a unique blend of philosophical monologue &/or soliloquy &/or dialogs, a mix of 'isms' (asburdism, surrealism chiefly, even magical realism in tiny spots), and if there were any film of the past ten years that I might offer up as a recommendation to Godard, it might be this. Richard Linklater also serves up his kind of sequel to his first film, Slacker, which was about as free-form and experimental and questioning and thinking about the ways of life as any given group of college kids (the bright ones I mean) might have on a bright day. It's ironic though after seeing the film to think that this is even considered a 'stoner movie'. The color scheme, developed by Bob Sabiston (who would also head A Scanner Darkly, another Linklater film), is about as wild and perfunctory for the kind of mood that Linklater could get. Wily Wiggins, after getting hit by a car, drifts in and out of dreams- constantly dreaming one could only possibly think to guess- as people come forward in Austin Texas to put forward views on life. But will this state of constant dreaming (sometimes 'lucid' sometimes not) continue? This is the thread that hangs all of the film together like a true-blue stream-of-consciousness clothesline that would appeal to stoners, I think, and at one point I did even consider being high for the duration of the picture. I was more glad to be sober for it all though, because as I write this I wonder if I could even grasp everything- or maybe need to again- on a 2nd full viewing. So much still sparks off in my head of things I connected with by what the characters talked about to Wiley (chiefly things regarding existentialism and Sartre, free-will, how dreams can affect how we perceive things in the 'real' life, and the ideas concerning cinema itself and Bazin). While once or twice it came close to becoming almost TOO much of a eye-grabbing and mind-churning thing that once or twice it's more of a random 'essay' than really a good scene. But like with Slacker, there's also the occasional jab of fine humor from Linklater, like the ape working the projector reading off paper, or the guy who reappears as a convenience store clerk. Towards the end, as Linklater himself appears on camera and has maybe the longest talk of all, Waking Life becomes all the more clear and revelatory.This is really, when it comes down to it, an independent production with a real independent thought process to it. Linklater, with Sabiston as something like his best kind of collaborator, guides us through all of this to see what's so wonderful, strange, horrifying, incendiary, crude, and worthwhile about what it is to try and live one's life, but also in seeing it through the perspective of the un-reality of a reality of some kind of other dream state. Or something of that nature. At any rate, it wont be everyone's cup of tea, and if you do decide to make it as such a stoner movie be ready to take in everything that's being said along with the crazy animation. While I might take Linklater's Scanner Darkly just slightly over this one (due to the animation for that being better in its control and working much better with a much more sustained subject matter), Waking Life still holds its own as one of his most ambitious projects that ends up going one step further than Slacker. He's working at full-speed with the faculties of experience, intelligence, questioning (and maybe not always, appropriately, with answers), and ultimately creativity. And that musical accompaniment is one of the finest in years.",

Taking the general form of Slackers, he adds a metaphysical story line and coats it with extraordinary eye candy. The rotoscoping really provides an acid trip experience of constantly shifting planes with backgrounds going one way and characters going the other.The string quartet tango score also is an excellent use of music to reinforce the exotic aspects of the production.The monologues are thought provoking and compelling. The story line examining dream/death connection is novel. Score points for originality of story, art direction and narrative line. Some quite funny parts (e.g. boat car, bar shoot out, etc.), some creepy parts (e.g. jailbird rant, second boat man meeting, etc.).I have seen this several times and enjoyed it every time. Farily rare is the movie that can really stand up to multiple viewings. This is one.Very refreshing. See it.",

            "content": "I watched Waking Life more for the visual appeal because I wanted to see Linklater's use of rotoscoping before he did it to mixed effect in A Scanner Darkly. With this in mind I did not have a clue what the film was about and for some reason I thought it would be some sort of New York set Slackers comedy with a lot of narrative drift \u0096 I have no idea where I got this idea from but it was at least accurate in regards the \"narrative drift\". To describe the basic plot it is enough to say that the main character spends the film in a sort of dream state in which he meets/sees all manner of people who discuss ideas, theories and philosophy of life \u0096 and that's more or less it.OK so by now you already know whether you will hate this or not, although you don't know if you will like it. If you're in the mood for an action film with everything spoon-fed to you then just leave this one on the shelf of course. So now we are down to who will like this film and I sort of fall into that camp but not entirely due to the film itself. The constant stream of rambling discussion and thought is rather hit and miss. At times it made me think for myself around what the characters were saying and it engaged my brain in a way that I suspect it wanted to. At other times the philosophy and thoughts are those of the pop-culture Gen X slacker and as such they are \"depth\" for those with shorter attention spans. At other times it just came over as out and out pretentious. Of these three feelings the split was reasonably even and it did damage the film that it was not as smart or as insightful as it clearly wanted to be.It did do enough to make me glad I watched it though and this feeling is partly down to the experience of watching something that stands out from everything else. What I mean by this is that watching it one never doubts that you are watching an indie film with a lot of creativity and ideas behind the writing and delivering of the film. OK so it doesn't all work and not all the ideas turn out to be good ones but as an cinematic experience it is nice to have something that is not another genre comedy or serviceable action blockbuster. This creativity expands to the animating of the life-action and again while not totally successful it is at least interesting. This technique is sometimes pointless when it is literally just animated life-action but it introduces movement to static items, visualises words and of course allows things like floating to be easily shown. I would not want to watch a film done this way every week but again seeing it not only done but done for a reason within the material is worth the experience.Waking Life is far from a good film but it is undeniably creative and interesting. As much works as doesn't about it and the material could have been stronger for a better film but it is still an experience worth having if you know what you are getting into. It is the summer season and the next massive (and disappointing) effects-driven blockbuster will be along imminently so Waking Life is worth checking out because it is the polar opposite by being experimental, creative and interesting. Yes it is flawed and weak but somehow the strengths make me forgive it such failings for at least having the spirit to try.",

It has its flaws, but only in retrospect or through the eyes of another will they be found--and then forgiven if you have even an ounce of heart or a particle of transcendence.It gets beneath one's radar and past one's filters.For instance, it hits you perceptually with constantly varying animation styles, and after some time, you adjust to this so much that when you leave the theater, THE WORLD IS ANIMATED--a poetic way of saying that your connection to the proposition that all things are real is loosen WONDERFULLY!And then, it hits you intellectually by parading a dozen+ viewpoints of persons who would not necessarily disagree with one another, but show the vast importance to us of the personal way we manifest our philosophical axioms and how much that depends on our individual interests-not all of us are psychologically constructed to be philosophers, but all of us can be analyzed to have a philosophical set of suppositions. Waking Life challenges these suppositions by merely presenting to you, in dramatic form, persons who vividly present their `takes' on the concepts and how they are impacted by them...especially emotionally.Ultimately, this is not a movie, and it shouldn't be viewed as such; instead, one should approach it as therapy. See it, be with it, relax, and GROW. Every time you see it again, the concepts saturate your nervous system with reinforcing patterns that will later \"echo\" in your dynamics in synergistic ways. A seed gets planted and with repeated viewings the seed gets watered.Go to this event. See it from a seat that's within the first ten rows of the theater; immerse yourself. Let go.

            "review_title": "pretentious garbage",
            "content": "Let me begin by saying that reviewing this movie puts you into a damned if you do, damned if you don't scenario.  If you think it sucked, well, you're just too stupid to understand it, or you don't have the attention span. \"Why don't you just go see Monster's Inc.\", they'll rebut.  So you are forced to say that you like it.  I'd be willing to bet that at least 50% of those saying it is great (with no specificity) are just trying to avoid looking like they can't understand it.Now, onto my review.  I wonder if the people who call Linklater brilliant think that he somehow wrote all these theories?  That he is some metaphysical genius that invented all these positions?  I would hope not, as he obviously didn't.  Which leaves me to ask, \"What did he do that deserves my praise?\"  The guy went to a university with a tape recorder, got some real-audio of some Psychology 101 and Philosohpy 101 lectures, and paid some animators to draw someone saying them.  The theories discussed are not advanced.  They are fairly common and easy enough to follow.  Even the boy admits, \"they sound familiar, like I'd heard them somewhere\".  They don't get more complex.  They don't refute each other.  They don't build.  They don't reach a conclusion.  They are just strewn together, willy-nilly.  If you're going to make a film exploring all of these issues, at least do me the favor of taking a position on them... give me some insight, some enlightenment.  To just present them without organization or taking a position just seems to translate to me as: \"See how much I know??\"  Like a discussion with someone after their first philosophy class, when they recite theory to you, without questioning, challenging, or even favoring any of it.I feel that the use of the plot being that the boy was dreaming (or dead) was to hide the fact that Linklater DIDN'T have any profound point to make. Only in a dream could he get away with an incomprehensible, poorly organized blob of discussion on a topic.  Had this movie been set in the real, waking world, he would have had to go somewhere with this... to make a point or take a position.  But as it was he could just let it be slop.See this movie only if you'd like to pretend you and your friends are intellectuals for a night.  Then log onto imdb.com and write about how profound and moving it was, but don't, whatever you do, say why.  Just saying that it was deep and explored reality and the mind will suffice. Did this movie make for a stimulating evening?  It could.  But don't think that this movie is intellectually superior to another just because it uses big words and discusses metaphysics.  You can analyze pop movies and try to pull meaning from it, too.  And at least the pop movies mask it in the DETAILS OF A STORY instead of just purely PRESENTING YOU WITH RAW THEORY. Is Moby Dick just about a whale?  Is Star Wars just about rescuing a princess?  No.  These tales explore quite a bit of human dynamics and philosophy, but at least they have the sense of ART to present it in a masked way.     This is not an art film.  It isn't even a film.  It's an intro class lecture with pictures.",

The film deals with the idea of lucid dreams and the nature of our existence and many other philosophical questions. What struck me about the film was the way in which the superb animation was layered over the film. What this achieves is indeed a sense of a dreamlike viewing experience.Everyone has those dreams where they have a great sense of having gone somewhere and done something wonderful when they wake up. It may be difficult to remember details of your surroundings or what exactly you did but you know you were somewhere doing something. The jumpy nature and fluid characteristics of the animation really help to create that very same feeling while viewing the film.I cannot stress the creative genius of Richard Linklater enough. He appears himself at the end of the movie and brings some closure to the main protagonists' dilemma of being trapped in this dream state. The film highlights the idea of how intertwined our dream lives and our Waking lives are. Memories that we once thought to be real often turn out to dreams and vice versa. Fans of philosophical debate and chat will be in heaven here however those who find themselves easily bored by such discussions may be skipping some scenes. Finally, Waking Life is another chapter in the pioneering film-making of Richard Linklater. He has given us such gems like Before Sunrise and Dazed and Confused. He has achieved in bringing film back to its essentials.. performance and script.",

The movies' look isn't a case of style over matter at all, it's what gives \"Waking Life\" it's dream-like quality. This look is what really sucks you into this completely different world, this dream world.Although I've loved some of Linklater's movies dearly (\"Before Sunrise/Sunset\", \"Dazed & Confused\", \"School Of Rock\") and I have appreciated him as a rather versatile director before, it's \"Waking Life\" that convinced me that he's a real master, as artistically skilled as Michel Gondry or Darren Daronofsky. It may not be Linklater's very best movie, but his directing and his writing here are probably his most artistic and masterful work so far.",

The ideas are all so intriguing that I don't understand how anyone can hate this movie. I can understand that it could be hard to sit through if you're tired, or if you refuse to contemplate the endless possibilities presented. I'll also admit that some people would find it very hard to watch the animation, but to me it keeps your attention. I tried to imagine what this movie would have been like if it hadn't been animated and I don't think it would have had the impact on as many people as it has if it weren't for the animation. I think that anyone who enjoys the topic of dreams would find it worthwhile. I could watch this movie over and over and still find something that I hadn't noticed before. If you don't like movies that make you think, don't watch it. But if you want a movie that gives you a lot of things to think about and allows you the freedom to interpret it in many different ways . . . check it out!",

To call it different isn't, in this case, a compliment and while the visuals are remarkable they are often remarkably annoying - the wavy animation might induce a feeling of sea-sickness.Not everyone was wowed by Linklater's double-bill \"Before Sunrise\" and \"Before Sunset\", (he made this three years before \"...Sunset\"). Many people chalked those down to an Ethan Hawke ego-trip, (I wasn't one of them). An animated Hawke turns up here, very briefly I'm glad to say, together with an animated Julie Delpy but this time I wanted to rub him out, literally. Come to think of it, there wasn't anyone on screen I didn't want to erase. These are the kind of people that, if you knew them, would turn most people into reclusive hermits. You keep watching to see how, if at all, Linklater will develop his ideas in purely visual terms but if this were not an animated film and had real actors instead of what are, fundamentally, their cartoon selves, you would definitely switch off long before the end.",

This movie is not for everyone, at least not for those who like their films 'light'. The fact is that Waking Life consists mostly of the main character discussing philosophical topics with various colorful characters. At some point it was difficult to remain concentrated to everything the characters say, for they were rambling quite discoursively, making the audience feel like they're attending a lecture. But the animation makes up for that, because the film has so much visual content that one could also watch it with out the dialog, just being immersed in the art.I'm not an expert in philosophy, I've just taken one beginners class, although i am interested in the topic. In reply to complaints condemning the film pretentious or complaining that it's philosophical ideas are old or overused. I'd say that Waking Life, rather than trying to reinvent philosophical theories, tries to present these ideas in the form of a film the same way as Jostein Gaarder's book 'Sophie's World'. It could in that way function as a sort of 'window' into the world of philosophy, a first touch. I'd hesitate calling it a beginners guide to philosophy as the language is demanding, especially for non natives. But on my part, I feel having expanded my horizons, by experiencing Waking Life. This movie can be enjoyed on many levels, and also a whole spectrum of interpretations can be drawn from it, watch it and see what it makes you feel.",

That's the way the \"dialogue\" came across, anyway. The result is a pedantic, pretentious, disjointed mess that also lacked a decent plot.The \"jiggle vision\" animation didn't help, either. I found myself closing my eyes to eliminate the distraction so I follow the dialogue, but it wasn't worth it. I found the monologue approach preachy and  insulting, a lazy effort on the part of the writers where ideas were spouted quickly and unchallenged, and heavy-weight philosopher names were dropped (answer to question in the movie: \"laziness\"). I kept thinking \"Wait a minute! Wait a minute!\" as premise after questionable premise and argument was tossed forth, but left behind as the volume of philosophical babble increased, but not the quality. It reminded me of a bad 3rd year philosophy class I took once, but far worse. Some of the speeches in this movie might have impressed me as a teenager, but they smacked of confused pseudo-intellectualism instead.It's too bad, really. I'm pleasantly surprised that something so unusual could find its way into the theatres. I'll give the filmmaker full marks for trying something different, even if I was in pain for 90 minutes as a result. At least it wasn't formula. The animation approach could have been interesting, if applied better to pointedly enhance surrealism, but it was wasted here. I didn't see any real art in it.  *Some* of the observations and remarks made by the characters were superficially interesting, but unfortunately nothing was done with any of these points (like actually integrating them into a lucid story, even a surreal one, and thereby creating context). \"Jacobs Ladder\", which had live actors, took a similarly surreal approach to dreams, but was far more effective and intelligent.",

Film is a medium that combines sound and moving imagery and it is wasted in \"talk about\" scenes.  Tom's theory was that you should always show your audience instead of \"talking about\" what you want to show them.Which brings me to \"Waking Life.\"  I had never heard anything about this film, read anything about it, seen any previews.  At first, I thought it was some of the best animation I had ever seen.  But then I thought, \"wait a minute, did they just videotape some scenes and photoshop them?\" Essentially, yes.  The footage was shot and then the \"animators\" rotoscoped the scenes on computer.  Why did they do this?My hypothesis is that the filmmakers actually just made a miniDV movie and when they saw how badly it turned out, they decided to animate it.  Somehow, animation would lend the film credibility.Unfortunately, it doesn't.  Animation is a wonderful art form, allowing artists to do things that you couldn't normally do in a real movie.  I've seen all sorts of animation, from Japanese to disney, and in almost all cases you get things in animation that you couldn't actually film.  Weird angles, fast motion, explosions, grand cities, talking animals, etc. \"Waking Life\" is about our dreams, what a perfect time to use animation... ...but they blew it.  Instead of showing us the beauty of dreams through animation, this is merely an amateur miniDV movie that's been painted over. People could argue I didn't \"get\" the movie.  Understanding the movie is besides the point.  The filmmakers had a chance to animate a complete dream world and instead we get very long, pretentious \"talk about\" scenes.  The film could have allowed us to be inside a dream; instead, we merely watch people talk about dreams.  Only two of the scenes were really interesting, the rest of the vignettes had dialogue that was so laughably absurd that I almost stopped watching.  No matter who you are or where you live, people don't just suddenly bring up their ideas of dreams or these reports they've read.  It seemed like everybody in the movie was able to say \"That reminds me of something (famous philosopher) said or this (famous study).\"  Somehow, everyone studied dreams in their free time.  With the tools at their fingertips, why didn't the filmmakers show us a dream instead of telling us about it?  What a wasted opportunity.  If I wanted to watch people talk, I could.  I wanted to see a dream, and that they did not provide.",

Suddenly, like a wave crashing against the shore, it hits. Why am I here? What do my dreams mean? Is there free will or is my life planned out ahead of time?The questions that philosophers for thousands of years ask \"why?\" have driven mankind on a search for reason and understanding. How to free oneself in everyday life. To really understand why things happen, not just physically but mental processes. Filmmaker Richard Linklater supplies some much needed thinking material for those restless nights and boring work days in Waking Life. It is fuel for the mind. Filmed in segments using breakthrough computer imaging software, the film is a combination of live action with animation drawn over. It is real enough to know that actors are being used, but distant enough to know that there is something very unique going on here.Each segment has slightly different animation, showing the many animators and their styles. Each segment also has a different topic discussed, but all essentially have the same idea; to think about the things we take for granted and the things we overlook and analyze them to a point of amazing detail and revelation. The main character, unnamed, is basically listening to all of these conversations and lectures as well as trying to find out what is going on with himself.His problem is he is constantly dreaming and doing so unknowingly. There is no fine line between reality and his dreams. This is where these topics and ideas play an important part in trying to bring him back from his dream state and back to his \"waking life\". All of the people he encounters along this journey seem to be of the same state of mind. Constantly trying to understand and comprehend what is going on.Linklater doesn't waste time with this film. Every segment has a purpose, even the breaks in between the talks and chats between the main character and other \"dreamers\", as well as those with completely different characters having the same questions. The animation is fun to watch as the world that we know is seen through the eyes of a dreamer, always moving and changing. Seemingly boring chatter becomes an intense conversation with the senses.Not everyone thinks the same. Not all of these topics will spark the imagination and get the wheels turning. Certainly, the animation is an experience on its own. But even if one topic, one comment can change your way of thinking, the film has served its purpose.

I was more absorbed in the topics of conversation and ideas that are rich throughout the film. Some may find the lack of a linear story or any sort of resolution a little frustrating but I think it would have diminished the film greatly if anything was explained. It is only tainted by the appearance of Alex Jones, yep, that Alex Jones. At the time of seeing in 2001 I had no idea who he was. Years later I was watching it and now the voice was very familiar. I read the credits and confirmed that it was him. This is my favourite sequence. In it he plays a variation of the \"character\" we've come to know on his show but here there is hopeful nature to his rantings. Despite this Waking Life is still a film that ignites my imagination.

Yes, it follows the same routine, as young vagabonds traverse the streets of Austin, TX waxing philosophically about their disconnectedness. But 'Waking Life' is a fantasy film that is more in spirit with the works of David Lynch than with any disenchanted 'Gen-X' flick. The plot here is simple. A young man keeps waking up only to find that he is simply waking up into another dream instead of really waking up. He comes across numerous 'dream figures' who provide varying theories on the nature of life, death, dreaming and fate while the young man continues to question the reality around him and his part in controlling it. The film gave me that giddy sense of 'aha' that I used to get in my early years of college during the most enlightening moments of a psychology or philosophy lecture where a theory I had never dreamed of was first brought to my attention. While this is a 'talky' flick that may come across as pretentious, the animation provides some great visuals that I at times found distracting from the interesting theories being discussed. Since Linklater essentially drew over live-action shots, I wondered what the film would've played like without the animation. I imagine some of the 'flying' sequences above the streets of Austin could've been hauntingly beautiful. All in all, a great flick that really makes you think. I have to appreciate any film that made me run to computer afterward to research the life of Philip K. Dick (the great sci-fi writer whose bizarre Gnostic brand of mysticism plays a big role in the ending of this film). A film that encourages the viewer to wonder and dream and learn is a rare one, and should be treasured.",

At first it might distract or feel weird seeing shakiness all over and big eyes seemingly pulsating in and outside the lines of their faces, but after the initial unsettling cartoonish vibe, everything just becomes more surreal. It's art, and it's beautiful. Richard Linklater's attention to details with his cameraworks and cinematography gives you a unique experience, but what makes his movies stand the test of time is his script. As taut as a newly-adjusted guitar string, his dialogues/script reverberates from your ear into your mind & into your soul, and it will be hard to shake it out of your system . It's as real as life, as tight as Superman's spandex. It's a fantastical feeling. At some point while watching I ask myself, if this is done without the animation, would it be the same movie? No. What makes Waking Life as surreal & beautiful as a famous work of art is the fusion of its unique animation, script, & the music. The fast-talking, quick-paced documentary vibe, the use of musical instruments that stirs at your soul, the fascinating animation, and the thought-provoking dialogues worked perfectly for me. As one character has said, \"Don't ever be bored!\" And I wasn't.As the writer character in the movie said, the greatest story ever told is \"people, gestures, moments, bits of rapture, fleeting emotions.\" You don't need a coherent plot or a named protagonist for this kind of movie, all you need is to clear your mind and enjoy this wonderful, cerebral dream-like experience.

Every frame seems to have been hand-drawn, and not particularly exact, which creates a very unstable picture. All lines seem to dance on the screen, and it is to say the least, more disturbing than watching NYPD Blue for the first time. This is, however, very interesting and beautiful and the unsettling aspect of it disappears after a while. The downside of this is that the film consists of some really heavy dialogue, and it is extremely hard to concentrate on the images as well as the words. It is evident that Linklater has studied psychology and philosophy. These are highly fascinating subjects, but they may not be as well-placed in this case. Although Linklater provides no answers to his philosophical subjects which are constantly discussed, I got the sense of being preached. That is never a good idea for an artist. Some of the points are very good, like the dream theories, but most of the time the viewer is put on the school bench. Linklater wants to change the world, but he should not make such direct attempts. Some parts of the film contain one on one conversations. It is fun participating in philosophical discussions, but being on the eavesdropping side usually makes it more ridiculous. Especially when you're eavesdropping on youngsters who believe they have solved the puzzle of life.\nLinklater's philosophical ideas were evident in his Before Sunrise too, but it worked better then because that was mostly a love story which overshadowed the strange dialogue. Waking Life is not all bad, it's just that much of the film seems not to belong in a theater. And when the discussions become too preachy, you can always turn all your concentration on the fabulous artwork.Rating: 6/10",

Better yet this movie is catered to those with ADD (the majority populace exposed to television on a regular basis). Each segment is no more than three minutes long.'Waking Life' spends an entire day following an anonymous character around Texas slowly revealing that his reality is in actuality a dream. He encounters many people with many voices ranging from the philosophically enriched to the ludicrously absurd. This movie also takes time to show separate characters encountering similar conversations. Enigmatic and thought provoking this movie is a Philosophy scholar's wet dream. Two aspects of this movie are truly enriching. First the obvious fusion of live film and cartoon animation. This creates a wonderful limitless, yet grounded platform for the animators imagination. As many animators were hired for various segments you get a new contrast and depiction for every maxim introduced. Though slight and strong fluctuations surface as obvious additions to the original film, for the most part the animation adheres to the actors and their brilliant portrayals as 'characters' in a dream or even dreamers themselves.Second, the rich, rapidly paced dialogue covering grounds from Socrates to Nietzche keeps the mind and senses at bay throughout leaving the audience second guessing foreknown conclusions. The actors superbly take these dialogues and read them as if they were their own speculation. Of course one wonders if at the end, \"Did the movie really add up, or does it leave us off the same if not further from when we started?\" Reminiscent of such great indie films such as 'Roadside Prophets', 'Waking Life' covers ground most movie makers would rather not tread. This movie boldly caters to the select minority of the populace who admire and cherish the ultimate freedom of 'thinking' and at the same time shuns away a majority of movie viewers who only settle for less than such. I would only recommend this movie to those I respect, and whose sense of mental and spiritual exploration is not limited.\nBottom Line: Embraced with a freakishly romantic soundtrack and dictated by independently aware artists' pen, 'Waking Life' allows one to give up worldly ways for a brief moment and opens the soul to an exploration of the parallels between the waking life and the dream state.",

It's like hanging out with someone that took a bunch of philosophy classes at a bad community college and can't stop telling you about a bunch of stuff he assumes you've never heard of.  It is possibly the most pretentious, stupidest movie I've ever seen.In fact, it's the first movie in my entire life (as far as I can remember, and that's pretty far) which I can remember leaving the theatre in the middle of the movie because it was so bad.  Not just me, but the 3 other people I was with (2 girls and a guy) were all so bored and we all felt like we were being talked down to by the filmmakers that we all left.\nPretty much nothing happens, and then something really gory will happen, and then nothing will happen for a long time after that.  No reason they needed to add the terrible animation because all anyone does is talk.  It's the same as \"Slacker\", but not funny, just going on about philosophy, which doesn't make good movies.Linklater should switch to documentary films to save his career.  This movie was a waste of time and money for everyone, including the audience.",

It's the kind of movie you'll either shut off after ten minutes, or love completely. For me, it's the latter.I found this movie to be a thought provoking exploration of the world of dreams and dreaming, and the nature of reality. It creates a vivid, dreamlike atmosphere where nothing is quite what it seems and anything is possible. In large part, this is due to the \"trippy\" (for lack of a better word) animation style, which is constantly changing and shifting, much like the rhythms and images of real dreams.Roughly the first half of the movie consists of a series of lectures, wherein the protagonist is a passive participant. Basically he (and thus we) are being lectured by a series of people, presumably academics, on various philosophical topics. This part of the movie could be either quite interesting, or terminally boring depending on your point of view. In any event, it gives us as viewers quite a bit to chew on, and goes a long way towards creating the mood of the film.Gradually, the protagonist becomes a more active participant in his \"dream\" - for we're never sure as viewers exactly what's going on. It is implied that our hero could be dreaming, or awake, or possibly even dead. But gradually he begins to interact more with his environment, and manages to incorporate much of what he's learned via the \"lectures\" into his life and/or dream experience. This is the plot as it stands, but this movie isn't really your typical plot driven film. It's more of an experience, like a long, strange, vivid dream.I really enjoyed this movie, so much so that I felt compelled to buy it. I'm not exaggerating when I say that this film affected me deeply, and made me re-examine what dreams mean to me and my life. It gave me a deeper appreciation of the dream state, and of the lessons about life and about ourselves that can be learned there. Dream on.....",

And as it turns out, its ideas are catastrophically weak and largely banal. The majority of the ideas in this movie are borderline incoherent and poorly elaborated, steeped in the intellectual waste that is post-modernism and consisting of vague and sweeping rhetoric that only simulates the act of actually thinking about anything. The few ideas that do have merit are used to draw outlandish and untenable conclusions, with only one exception in the entire movie (your job is to figure out which one). Additionally many of these are very basic and simple and could be found just by reading secondary sources on philosophy, psychology, linguistics and evolution. On top of all this, Linklater fails to provide any structure or stance for these ideas, tossing them about all haphazardly, trying to impress the viewer with the sheer volume of ostentatiously dressed but poorly thought out, banal ideas. This makes the movie come across as extraordinarily self-indulgent and mind-numbingly pretentious...which, it is. The only redeeming feature of this film is the use of rotoscoping, which is a very versatile technique and used to decent effect in this movie. Unfortunately, because the movie itself is so bad, rotoscoping is sadly reduced to a gimmick to distract viewers from thinking about how much money they just wasted to see this movie.",

            "content": "I rented WAKING LIFE for free from my local county library. It seemed interesting and several well-known critics gave it very good reviews. For what it is, it is excellent. But I got bored and skipped through chapters after the first 35 minutes or so. I guess you have to be in the mood...The movie asks questions like \"what is real and what is a dream?\" It discusses such things as evolution and how current evolution is different from evolution thousands of years ago. The topics are suitably deep, and are discussed by apparently very knowledgeable characters. They make sense. If I were still the type of person who enjoys making small talk for hours at cocktail parties, sharing philosophies on \"the meaning of life\" with others at the party, then I believe I would also have been in the mood for WAKING LIFE. But I am not, and therefore I was not. But I can also understand how many will think this is a great movie. Different strokes for different folks.What I found most interesting were the \"extras\" on the DVD, particularly how WAKING LIFE was made. As you watch the movie, the animation has a pastel water-color look to it, but the characters and scenery look strangely real, even though objects jump around a lot. In fact, I easily recognized Ethan Hawke from his animated character, even though I didn't know ahead of time he was in it. That's because the entire movie was shot first with a small, hand-held digital camera, and was edited and assembled that way. Then the animators used a very unique software to convert the digitally photographed (I hesitate using the term \"filmed\") movie into a much more beautiful animation that resembles the scenery and actors very closely. There is something about it that almost mesmerized me. I hope they use the technique for other movies, but for me topics which are more interesting.",

I seriously consider this a beautiful experience that most people should enjoy and discuss in order to embrace evolution of human life. If this does not seem match your 'preferred genre profile' or 'entertainment style', do this; Watch it alone with a open mind - and stay present - accept and understand. You may in the end be rewarded with a deeper insight to human life through the channeled wisdom of the people involved. Except the red guy in jail who is a truly scary embodiment of unconsciousness... along with the guy who shoots the bartender. Some of the protagonists are deeply trapped within their own minds while other have liberated themselves and as free as birds. Humans as humans should be. Human 2.0 (or is it 3 or 4).If this is for you: watch it and smile.The contrast is both scary and powerful and serves to show how we should take responsibility for our lives and each other. But the movie is not moralistic - it's simply honest and most of the people reconstruct a reality that all humans deserve to sense beneath 'the matrix'... as such it's a quest for the truth and the meaning of life.The first 10 minutes may be an exit prequel for completely unconscious people (almost had me turn it off - I didn't). Guess I am just another example of how we are zombies brainwashed into stereotyped entertainment schemes - accepting the unreal - drama and indifference as the point of life when there is so much more. In the end it comes forward more as an emotion than through the beautiful perspectives on human life and beyond is portrayed. The narrative is well constructed and creatively put together in a 'acid'-like yet non-cheesy cartoon theater setting. The setting becomes the voice of the movie along with the young male main character trapped in the infinite loop of life. Who am I? What matters? What is dream? What is real? Personally I will always be grateful for this experience Richard Linklaiter - so thank you! Whether alienated from society, alone, open for new impressions or in spiritual search of meaning and enlightenment this dream is surely one everybody should benefit from having at least once in the lifetime...

In the 2000's, when Linklater was a much more established filmmaker, he semi-updated this older work, but, instead of focusing on the daytime that defined \"Slacker\", Linklater seems to have trapped \"Waking Life\" in the midst of the night. Even when daylight floods the lens, our protagonist and guide through his own mind is as aware as we are that he is trapped within his own dream...and the dream layers are stacking up. He awakens only to be stranded in another subsection of his growing, energetic subconscious, and many serious discussions of and questions concerning deep philosophical thought are explored in depth. \n The tone is certainly more serious and less self mocking than \"Slacker\", but the entertainment value is still there, and many little moments of clever comedy are perfectly placed throughout (a talking monkey, an uproariously absurd encounter between the protagonist and an eccentric clerk he believes to have seen earlier in the dream); however, there is also plenty of fuel and food for extreme existentialist thought dealing with death and, even more prominently and uniquely, dreams. Is life a dream? Is life not life, but really death? Is anyone really here, or is it all just one's mind? Questions, questions, questions...no real answers. Moments, swirling, moving....movements...the whole film flows like a river, it feels like an actual DREAM! There are reoccurring themes, ideas, and faces, but there is no real narrative, at least not in a remotely conventional sense. It is scene after scene of discussion and discourse, characters come and go out of nowhere, some even die outrageously, while others take on new personalities and minds as the tale trails along...there are appearances from professors, philosophers, doctors...the likes of Ethan Hawke, Alex Jones (?!), and Steven Soderbergh have brief splashes of screen time in which they spew brief speeches jam packed with rigorous insight into all sorts of topics...stories are told, political rants are screamed, theories are deeply analyzed, love is discussed, hate is expressed...and it all culminates in one of the greatest, most totally chilling and thought provoking monologues I've ever heard, performed with grace, humor, realism, emotion, and intelligence by the man behind the camera himself, Richard Linklater.",

Perhaps I would have enjoyed this movie more back in the days when I spent my time listening to talk radio, but even though you had two-way conversation.  I would say this would work better if it were transcribed and put in a book called, \"A Bunch of People Talk About Stuff.\"  It would probably make a good book.  But even though the look of the movie is striking, it's not really a movie at all, just talking heads. Something done better on the typical PBS documentary.  I won't say it's a bad movie, because it's such a different approach to filmmaking that I don't see how you can judge it relative to anything else (although it compares with the two closest films I can think of, My Dinner with Andre and Slacker).

For example, the idea that we're ants and should wake up was something already covered in a more coherent and accessible way by Antz.",

The movie is heavily dialogued. there are separate but vaguely related scenes. while the dialogues from each scene are intellectual and solidly meaningful, the whole story is conceptually not that rich. The basic questions about reality and the fundamentals of existence are well explained and sometimes are mentioned repeatedly. However, any hint to deal with that questions wouldn't be found. Not logically. The movie directs the audience to a spiritual window where you have no choice to look at life spiritually, for example as a waking-dreaming extended moment. I believe this is nothing more than a escape plan and imposing ignorance as the answer for those questions that their answers are unknown.Therefore, conceptually, I can say the movie successful challenges the basic concepts of life but it fails to provide realistic strategies to deal with those challenges. Instead it challenges the reality itself and it goes on and on. As for the art aspects it is amazing and atmospheric, very heavy though.Overall, It is a decent work, worth watching for those who are interested in conceptual movies.",

It may be a great conversation, and, as conversations go, an entertaining one. But not as movies go.These conversations are interesting, and I may even agree with a lot of it. I may have even thought and talked about these very same philosophical and abstract ideas. It can be fun. I like big ideas, I love to think in movies. I love Gattaca and Memento and Dark City, to name some recent examples.And believe me, I agree with the sentiment that it's good to ask questions and feel \"alive\" instead of some creature that is forced into what to think. And I do, in fact, find myself often longing for those days of yore, where these types of on-campus conversations happened regularly, as opposed to the mundane junk we talk about on a daily basis.But ultimately, though I might want to read the book, this does not make for a good movie. All of the fantastic and brilliant artistic effects in the world -- which this has -- should not deceive you into thinking otherwise.One problem is, I've had many of these conversations already, and they are generally fruitless. They may be mentally stimulating and interesting, but they ultimately are nothing more than mental gymnastics.But that's not really it. Mental gymnastics can be great in and of themselves. Our mind needs to be exercised or it just shrivels up.The big problem is, even if we're inclined to enjoy conversations and mind puzzles like this, we don't enjoy being passive observers of them. Whatever joy might be derived from this kind of thing comes from actually participating in the conversation, even if that means just writing your own essay.I believe participation is of the essence, because ultimately these kinds of conversations are an egotistical exercise. Since these big ideas don't really have answers, the conversations are ultimately fruitless and frustrating, so just listening to them gets you nowhere. In fact, you could say these conversations are ultimately pointless to have, except as mental gymnastics ... just as basketball is ultimately a pointless pursuit except for the fun and exercise of it.I wonder if he's done this creative animation to hide the quasi-acting he made famous in \"Slackers.\" That would be really brilliant, come to think of it, since we tend to forgive bad acting, over-acting, under-acting -- or whatever you want to call it -- in animation. I liked Linklater's \"Dazed and Confused\" and \"Suburbia,\" but at least those movies had people trying to act.Of course, it could be argued, these characters aren't even pretending to act. They're just talking. But that would bring us right back to the original point.",

It demands patience, intelligence and repeated viewings. Unfortunately, I think this will only be a one time experience for me. This film is astounding and absorbing in many of its parts, but it asks a lot of your mind to take. I think it was a great decision to animate this in vivid rotoscope, because without it, many audiences would get restless and annoyed.

The \"plot\" if that's what it can be called is the journey of a young man through his own lucid dream and his struggle to understand the fundemental question in life, that are usually asked only by little children who aren't old enough to know better. During the course of the movie the unnamed dreamer meets a fascinating array of would be philosophers and arm chair scientists, each one ranting, conversing, philosophizing, thinking, hypothesizing on any number of intellectual ideas.

As we grow and get lost in the crowd we tend to keep away from the philosophy of life and seek only materialistic things, the money, the name, the prosperity while our purpose of existence and purpose of doing something still remains in question. We tend not to do a few things as we grow up due to fear and few things remain undone because of our laziness which essentially means that we are taking life for granted we are becoming complacent and certain of a tomorrow and even tomorrow we might not do it. That's just a part of this movie where i's said. There are many dialogues and of course this movie is nothing but dialogue driven, acting scope is minimal as it's a love action movie that makes you feel at first a bit bizarre coz it's neither animated nor a normal film and we are not used to this kind of presentation. If anything then it's editing and the animation that I restrict the technical departments to with art direction that will help what has to be there in the scene figuring out and all are apt. But I love the dialogue more than anything else. Be it a conversation of a couple, a interview on TV or in theatre, a monologue in jail, they are so prominent and one after another they keep the mind on the run and if there are questions that will run through the mind as we see it as ' what are we doing?,what are we here for? what is life after all?' I never get even for a split second what is the plot of the movie, what is it's story who are the characters and what are their motives, these things are not important here.It's terribly difficult to comprehend what it feels like after watching this movie except that as and when I watch it I just feel so happy and relieved but still questions keep boggling. I am very grateful to Richard Linklater the writer director of the movie for giving this film. It's one of the best gifts I had. It's 5/5 for the most thought provoking movie ever that I saw.

I'll pass over the pretentious, preachy tone present throughout the whole film, as most reviewers before me pointed it out so eloquently.What bugged me the most was the decision of using animation for telling the story or whatever was going on the screen. Once the perfect medium for conveying impossible worlds and materializing all things abstract, animation is today left in the hands of directors who attempt to make an otherwise uninteresting story stand out. Relatively recent examples include A Scanner Darkly and Waltz with Bashir. These, plus Waking Life have two things in common: they're rotoscoped, and nothing would've changed if they were shot in live-action. Tracing over live footage has to be the most hilarious attempt at novelty, ever. It's mind-blowingly unnecessary. The human beings depicted are wobbly, unnatural and ugly. Where's the personal touch of the animator? What's the point? Nothing improves, but everything becomes awkward. Nevertheless, A Scanner Darkly had a somewhat exciting story to tell, and Waltz with Bashir made a point, without insulting the audience's intelligence, I might add. Here's how I imagine it went with the production of Waking Life: Alright, let's film some mediocre actors monologuing about whatever, gather untalented technicians so they can trace over every goddamn frame.

Do we even have memories or are they just fantasized stories that we create? Is every minute that passes still reoccurring in the past?

Just because a film deals with big themes and subjects dosen't make it pretentious. I found it brilliant and anyone who has an interest in philosophy cannot afford to miss this masterpiece.",

Yes, people don't \"talk like that in real life\", yes, some of the scenes are jarring and seem out of sync with the rest of the film. Did you not get the concept that the entire film is the main character's dream? Dreams are non-linear, they are often fragmented and disjointed. This film displays a dream's flow. No, it's not for everyone, if you want something everyone can access, I invite you to peruse the Big soft Disney video boxes. Timothy \"Speed\" Levitch was a high point for me, as always. It was also nice to see references and characters from \"Slacker\" make appearances. The opening where the main character is on a train looking out a window, very similar to the \"Slacker\" opening. He gets off the train and sees a woman, in Slacker this is related as a dream. A film that bears repeated watchings for those who want something a little more than Schlockbuster's typical new release du jour.\nRecommended.",

So, alright it won't appeal to some more that don't like to watch \"hard\" films or films that use \"difficult\" language.WAKING LIFE is a beauty, as it unfolds its magic to you. People who are thinking or have thought about the meaning of life, society structure, models of living, free will, perception of reality and much more \"philosophical\" subjects will love it. Also \"dreamers\", that is, people that dream a lot, or tend to think about their dreams, meaning of dreams and dreamy state of minds will also love it for sure !!!Yes, it uses kind-of \"difficult\" language and yes, it has many \"philosophical\" monologues. The animation is great (it's real-life actors \"cartoonized\" by processing resolution & colours probably) even if it could be worked out a bit more in some segments. Despite these 'defects' , there are some really refreshing scenes (or small details) whichmake it a bit lighter.All in all, a great viewing experience, if not for the visual part, surely for the context.

What I mean to say is, to witness something that is more than just film, more than just a story with a plot, theme and characters. Waking Life is one of these special films; it is a series of powerful ideas placed into a beautifully painted package. I was lucky enough to see this film on its opening night at the Chicago International Film Festival. It was great to see Richard Linklater introduce the film and then answer questions afterward. Some of the most insightful things he spoke of was his collaborations with the many actors on the dialog. As he came up with specific characters, he chose the actors that best fit the scene, and then allowed them to bring their own ideas into the dialog. (ie: the scene with the scientist who discusses his theory on evolution was actually a bio-chemist discussing his real ideas) I think that this allowed the film to take on a very real identity, as you plunge into the complex ideas presented, and then become mesmerized by the beautiful animation. I can't wait to see this film again. I might have to view it a few more times to be sure, but I think this is one of the best films I have ever seen. >",

If I want to explore the inner workings of the mind and the concept of dreams, I'd much rather read something by Sartre or Kierkegaard or any other psychologist or philosopher rather than watching Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy spew it back to me on screen.This movie spoon feeds philosophy to those who are too lazy to read the actual works of the authors cited.  Although an ambitious idea (and I do find the technique of animation over live film intriguing, even if it doesn't work), it fails miserably because it does indeed come off as pseudo-intellectual, pretentious garbage, and that's exactly what it is. Those people who insist that people like me cannot enjoy a film like this because I would prefer nudity and violence are arrogant pseudo-intellectuals themselves who are somehow convinced that if they make themselves more miserable by watching films like this, they'll become more intelligent.

Waking Life is a collaborative filmmaking achievement of profound philosophical muse, character development and improvisation, and an onslaught of stimulating line and color.  Do not miss this film.That said, my only complaint is that I felt overwhelmed.

            "review_title": "This film, along with Slacker, invented a genre of its own",
            "content": "What is the \"genre\"? Basically a bunch of random conversations about various subjects relating to life, the universe, philosophy, dreams, etc., but not a documentary. This film and its characters are assuredly fiction, but the subjects brought up relate to reality either directly or indirectly through metarealistic discussion.Despite the completely random feel and appearance, there is a direct consistency to it all in that it's always the same main character (played by Wiley Wiggins) taking part in the discussions, either just listening or occasionally replying, and there is also an indirect undercurrent of actual character progression. When we first begin both the viewer and the main character are completely lost, going through the journey with no known purpose or ending. But by the end of the film we see him almost grow, learn and accept. He begins to question his reality and form theories about what is happening to him. In turn we the viewer also begin the same. This is likely due to the various characters he is talking with. You could say they open his mind to questioning his surroundings and give their small clues to the viewer as to what is going on in the film.The film leaves it intentionally open as to what \"really\" is going on. Is it all a dream? Is he on drugs? Is he dead? It is almost as if the film suggests that there's no real difference among all these possibilities. This concept is indeed brought up in some of the conversations, notably one that begins, \"The worst mistake you can make is to think you're alive when really, you're asleep in life's waiting room,\" and another where a guy says, \"It's bad enough that you sell your waking life for minimum wage, but now they get your dreams for free.\" These passages, and plenty of others, support the position that the film is suggesting that there is barely any difference between being alive, dead, and dreaming, at least to his own perspective.The visual style is very interesting but can admittedly become disorienting and dizzying at times. However that was likely the intent, as the entire film discusses concepts relating to disorientation, dreaming, being a \"zombie\", etc. It is a technique that was brand new in 2001 when it came out, to my knowledge, or at least for a full feature film. Everything was actually filmed, but then artists went over every single frame and drew their own version of the scene over it. This gives it a very jittery, cloudy feel, because it was not carefully lined up perfectly, and mixing drawing with reality in general gives a hazy look. The amount of effort that went into this is greatly respectable, and I personally like the result, but could understand if some people couldn't really sit through it. I don't think the film would have had the same effect just keeping it regularly filmed though, so I admire the choice. The same kind of technique and style was applied to Linklater's 2006 film A Scanner Darkly, but it was a little bit more cleaned up and not as jarring in that film. However I don't necessarily think any one is better, just slightly different and each one fits their respective film's content.Some of the most dreamlike scenes in the history of cinema are in this film. By dreamlike I don't specifically mean the visuals, although they certainly don't hurt, but instead I mean the actual content happening and the resultant tone. Specifically, dreams often carry a much more casual tone than what reality does, at least in the actual events. Maybe you feel very scared, nervous, or anxious sometimes but the events happening around you are very casual compared to reality. For example, I've been naked in public in dreams often and did feel embarrassed in the dream, but the actual reactions are much less stirring than in reality. In reality people would react much more; they might be forward and tell you to put some clothes on, they might laugh at you, or they might be frightened and call the police. In the dream it's almost accepted behavior, or no one cares as much as they normally do. This kind of dreamlike quality is all over this film, specifically in the scene where a man in a bar casually pulls out a gun and, at the behest of the bartender himself, fires it at the bartender. The violence is very brutal, but when contrasted with the surrounding eerie silence, is actually quite frightening to observe. No one else in the bar is screaming or running. They just keep sitting there going on with their day. This is what I mean by the tone being much more casual, but the feeling not following suit.The actual content of the conversations varies much too widely. If I were to write about each one this would be a very very long review, so I shall refrain. I will just say that they are engaging and get you thinking, even if you disagree with what's being said. Many of them teach you perspectives, again whether you agree with them or not, opinions, and even facts you may not have known or just didn't think about in detail.Richard Linklater has created a very unique gem, and it may not be absolutely \"perfect\" in every respect, but I have never seen anything else like it to this day. Indeed, I feel that being a genre of its own deserves recognition, not to mention the vast variety of ideals brought up in the 99-minute runtime.",

Its clear the writers thought if they used big words they would come off as poignant. Which may have worked on some people, if a lot of the words weren't used incorrectly or made up completely. I find it sad that people would think that any of the conversations in the movie were insightful, the only time any of them would seem to be is if you were sitting in a circle waiting for the bong to get to you. None of the thoughts contained here are unique, its typical college age 'finding yourself' garbage that everyone has already thought about. The opening quote of the movie which sets the pace for the rest of it is 'dream is destiny' (except its spelt wrong, though understandable since it was a child writing it) sums up the movie best. Pretentiously trying to seem poignant and deep, while really its just an incoherent mess that has no meaning, but can sound kinda catchy to someone who doesn't think too hard. I suppose I can give extra points for trying something new with the rotoscooping, but that was done horribly. Anyone who knows anything about roto knows its not supposed to look like that. To me it just came off as another attempt of being 'ground breaking' when its just annoying and pointless. This is one of the worst movies iv ever seen its only attraction is how laughable it is due to it being completely full of itself. Its not deep its just a shallow impersonation of deep, or a mockery of deep conversation. This movie just screams hippie pot head conversations, I'm reminded of the episode of futurama 'Dude my hands are so big, and they can touch everything but themselves..... oh wait!\" If you want to sit and debate the meaning of life then feel free, but to sit and record debating over the meaning of life and make a movie about it to try to come off as smart or deep.... Get over yourself. Just because you have the ability to muster a small amount of brain power and think about philosophy doesn't make you special, or make this movie watchable.",

It's not that it is not fun, but it gets boring, really boring after a while.You know those discussions the protagonists had in Before Sunrise (also by the same director). Imagine a movie that contains nothing but those discussions, completely removed from context.

It's not just a computer effect on the entire film like A Scanner Darkly (also by Linklater), it's a lot more.Bottom line: it's an interesting film, one that deserves at least the attempt to watch it.

            "content": "(minor spoilers)Richard Linklater, director of 'Slackers' and \"Dazed and Confused', has tried something different with 'Waking Life'. That being animation! He shot the film on digital camera, and then roto-scoped the images using various animators to create a unique impressionistic visual experience. Something that is wildly different, and promising, until you actually watch the movie.'Waking Life' is simply boring! It has no real story, and it's just a bunch of characters that Wiley Wiggins encounters, who spout seemingly complex philosophies on life, dreams and whatever else they feel like talking about to him. The animation in 'Waking Life' is impressive, but equally vomit inducing ala motion sickness. I'm thankful I didn't see this on the cinema because even on DVD, the wobbling backgrounds were very detracting. Otherwise some of the animation is great, and 'Waking Life' definitely wins points for trying there. The animation does also provides the surreal aspect of the overall message in the film.Towards the last fifth of the movie, 'Waking Life' does improve slightly with its story, but the mundane element of actually getting there is rather frustrating. People complained about 'The Matrix Reloaded' being pseudo-intellectualism, but at least that still was cohesive within the context of the overall story. 'Waking Life' is totally filled with pseudo-intellectual, pretentious masturbatory ramblings that disregard telling a compelling visual story. The film could have been called 'Talking Heads' cause that's practically what it is. It's an indulgent mess that even pips its critics at the post by having a philosophy on the type of narrative or story it using. Seems to me as one big wanky excuse to film endless different characters having various philosophies on existence or whatever without producing a great filmic story. Other than some of the nice animation itself- which doesn't really go anywhere per scene, 'Waking Life' is a frustratingly annoying experience that is worth a pass simply because because of some of the unique visuals. Pity about those animated visuals being wasted on self-indulgent ramblings, and not a brilliant or even remotely intriguing story.**\u00bd out of *****!",

This movie looks like a living painting. The animators have sort of painted over the film. They also have made the images their own with stylistic embellishments on the characters and little additions in the background that illuminate the topics of the speakers' conversations. It would be enough for me to sit and simply watch the animation. It is very hypnotic and beautiful.Fortunately, however, the filmmakers had much more on their minds. The characters in this film discuss the very essence of life, our perceptions of it, and different approaches to dealing with what we are presented with on a daily basis. There is also a great deal of talk about dreams. The framework of the movie is that it is all ostensibly a dream of one young man, played by Wiley Wiggins (he was the freshman younger brother in Dazed and Confused). He becomes more involved later in the film, but is initially a passive observer, sometimes not even in the scene.Basically this movie is a forum for ideas.

Godard did it in \"Vivre Sa Vie\" when Anna Karina sat herself down in a bar with a real philosopher- and Louis Malle did it when Andre Gregory and Wallace Shawn sat and talked all night at their table in \"My Dinner With Andre.\"  But every generation has to re-invent the past and make it their own.   And why not? The bonus this time around is that the digital rotoscoping technique (filming the actors live, then animating them) is super kool.

It brought to mind the time when, back in the dark ages of black and white, the young son in Bergman's \"Through a Glass Darkly\" looked at the camera and said disbelievingly, \"Papa spoke with me.\" Keep your eyes out for Linklater's other new offering -shot on digital video- and, appropriately, called \"Tape.\"   It stars Ethan Hawke, UmaThurman, and Robert Sean Leonard, and it too is a cinematic treat.",

I was not dissappointed.Technically and artistically this film is a masterpiece that should put most other filmmakers to shame. It is honest and unique and beautiful.It isn't for everyone though. (It should be.) But, sadly, some people just don't like movies like this where people talk a lot and there's no cops/hostage-situations and car crashes and bombs blowing up. No... this movie laughs in the face of people like that. Well... never fear, my little pinhead evolutionary-relatives, there's PLENTY of OTHER movies out there for you.Most of the people in the theatre I saw it in sat in wrapt amazement as beautiful colors swirled across the screen and genuinely intelligent & funny dialog poured out of the speakers.If you liked Richard's OTHER masterpiece 'Slacker' then you will like this movie. We are rewarded with repeat performances by several of the Slacker troupe. Unlike Slacker, this one has a good soundtrack (if you like string quartet) and a much more defined topic.It is about a young man trying to figure out if he's awake or dreaming. More than anything this is a NICE movie. There is also a healthy dose of RAGE in this film. In light of the disasters going on in the world it is amazing how much this film can offer people. It is an absolute CRIME that this film isn't in wider distribution! But, considering that it is quite evident that the average hollywood exec has a brain the size of a mandarin orange, it is not surprising that this one went, SWOOSH!, right over their heads.Richard, if you're reading this THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU (ad infinitum) !!!",

It has to be seen half a dozen times atleast, if we are to grasp its true meanings. The animation is phenomenal, director has to be given credit for taking such a huge risk, and carrying it of so well. The heart of the film is of course, the discourses by the various characters in the film. I say discourses because conversations are almost non-existent. Perhaps, that's why this film hasn't got the grading it deserves. Most people might find it too complex and totally unlike their idea of what a film should be.See this film if you have the courage to take a fresh look at life, if you want to see how films can be made to force us to think in new lines.

This may well be the best work of cinematic genius I have ever seen. Every frame of this movie is pure, drugged up, mind-bending craziness. And that is just the visual aspect. Coupled with the dialogue, which is so well written and acted that it almost feels like these weird cartoon shapes are real people filmed on the spot, the whole experience challenges your entire perception. Thanks to the very impressive animation techniques - that I've only seen in the documentary 'The Five Obstructions' before, the faces, even in their deepest abstraction have never looked so human.

The script is atrocious; it seems as though someone who had just taken a philosophy 101 course wanted to show off that they knew something about philosophy.

It adds (the pin badge sequence, the 'holy moment' sequence) far more than it subtracts.The inclusion of an honest take on a young Alex Jones's ambitions is both charming and heartbreaking, and sums up this movie so well: it never tells you what to think, it always employs compassion instead of judgement, and is as subtle as the brushstrokes of the animated characters that inhabits its dream world.

The film consists of live action digital video footage that has been \"painted\" over using software developed by art director Bob Sabiston, by 31 strong animators, making the film a full dream-state. There is no real plot or point to the film, it just sees the Main Character (Wiley Wiggins) in his never ending dream going about seemingly normal routines, and passing many characters voicing their opinions and philosophies of life/the universe. Discussions in the film by the various characters include reincarnation, free will, relationships, existentialism (the thinking, acting, feeling and living of an individual), situationist politics, post-humanity, and of course, dreams, an escape from reality, or reality itself? The film does not answer these questions, it instead inspires us to ask the questions and find the answers ourselves, a very clever thing to do. Also starring Bill Wise as Boat Car Guy, Robert C.

            "content": "For the open minded, intellectually persuaded film fan, Waking Life is 120 minutes of unabated pleasure. It is undoubtedly one of the most original and innovative films you will ever see and will definitely stimulate your mind and senses. The film documents a series of lucid interactions of its lead character, Wiley Wiggins, as he meets an assortment of colourful and diverse persons. The basic premise is that Wiley doesn't know if he's awake, dreaming or in fact dead when he is meeting these people. Every facet of the film making process here is utilised to accentuate the confused state of the boy as he explores a world that may or may not be reality; it is expertly achieved. Lets start with the visuals. Waking life used pioneering robo(something?) technology to express the peculiar sensory disposition of its lead character. The technique involves real actors performing on camera and then for the finished product to be animated in post production. The result is a startling, other worldy and sometimes eerie ambiance. After ten minutes or so you will wonder if you are in fact experiencing a dream yourself. The wonderful animation works in conjunction with the meandering, non linear but exceedingly entertaining script, to give the viewer a real sense of queerness, and helps illuminate the fascinating insights of the characters Wiley meets. The animation also effectively keeps the viewer aware that he/she is watching something that is not occurring in the conscious world. The script itself is thought provoking and utterly stimulating, and gets the viewer, if he or she is a creative and imaginative individual, to immerse him/herself with the subject matter at hand and ask themselves the big questions of what life is all about, as the lead character does.Reading through some of the negative reviews on this website, I felt like flushing my head down the toilet. You cannot criticise a film for not doing something it never set out to do. Users on here have suggested that the film has no real narrative and that the characters are fleeting and inaccessible. Well duh? The film is about a dream, if any subject can allow for the abstract to flourish, it is subconsciousness. The film doesn't want to be a novel, it doesn't require a start middle and an end because it is merely an abstract exploration of social and cultural concepts. It doesn't want to explain the world to you and sew up the meaning of life, it just wants to provide a brief, vivid reflection of the elusive and tumultuous nature of ife. The characters are not there to be loved or hated or envied, they are there to represent the variety of beliefs and perspectives and opinions that mankind in all its diversity holds. The non linear essence of the film reflects the non linearity of life.Those of you who say this is not a film, I say you are an idiot. Who are you to say what constitutes art? A film doesn't need to pander to narratology to be good; its that sort of thinking which has led to the perpetuation of rubbish that we see made year upon year in the film industry. There should be no rules. Waking Life will give any forward thinking individual a fine film experience; it expertly achieves what Richard Linklater set out to do, which was to create a visually outstanding, mind expanding film which deals with social and cultural theory.Detractors of this film should drop out of that film studies class they have been attending because evidently it is turning you into a pretentious film prima donna.",

I could care less about what these people say. It's meaningless and might as well be white noise.Then there is a section with Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy in bed. They're having a different version of their conversation in 'Before Sunrise'. It's compelling cinema for someone like me who loves that movie. After that, the movie has more gobity gook and it loses me completely. This could be a great style to do with interviews with compelling real world figures.

This film has taken my view of poor film-making and general rubbishness to a new level. This is now the bad film that i will judge all other bad films by.I couldn't give this film a low enough rating if i used a million decimal places.

Great, now the pseudo intellectuals have invaded animation. Have mercy on our souls - please throw these people in prison! UUUUGGGHHHH, talk about cynical, this film is a quite literally a pretentious student's wet dream, it sends shudders down my spine. Bleugh! Imagine every nonsensical philosophical debate you have ever had, especially the ones from your late teens and early 20s, then mash them together and you have a good idea of what this film is. You will likely feel slightly nauseous looking at it as well because visually it is also horrendous, scenery wobbles and floats about in a 'dream' like manner and peoples faces bulge and deconstruct into a collection of blobs. The surrealist landscape of the film is initially quite endearing and unique but becomes annoying by about the 8 minute mark! I appreciate inventiveness and creativity if it's done right, but this film is just unacceptable in every way, it has zero entertainment value, it is a truly miserable and worthless experience that seems to ramble on and on (like myself:)) for much, MUCH longer than it's 90 odd minute run time. Some films take a message and wrap it up nicely in something called a story, then deliver it with grace and power. This film has a message but it is delivered as an endless stream of conversation (actually it's monologue, mostly) within the dream of the mysterious main protagonist. Throughout this dream we are presented with many different people who offer philosophical views on life, death, dreams and the world we live in. Instead of being even mildly interesting it is just pure torture as these messages are nothing you haven't heard a million times before (in more interesting ways) and they are delivered in monotone fashion by some of the most boring sounding (presumably stoned) idiots in the history of time, and it carries on and on right through the film until the last 2 minutes, it's hellish. There is only one decent moment in the movie IMO, which centres around a 'visitation to the land of the dead', that says a lot about the film as a whole. It's also VERY preachy (intentional) and whiny, it's like watching those overly enthusiastic TV preachers on 'The God Channel'(or whatever it's called) except without the entertainment value. The moral of this film is - The next time someone says \"let me tell you about a dream I once had\", you should just do yourself a favour and bash them in the face before they bore you to death with some endless philosophical babble.This film is basically a BAD version of Creauture Comforts without the humour and quirky characters. Get a bunch of boring people to talk, nay babble almost incoherently about a load of rubbish then do some dodgy animation to go with it and, hey presto, you have a work of art. The film makers have tried SOOOO hard to be smart, poetic and cutting edge but have failed to realize that in the process they have created something that actually defeats it's own purpose. They have ended up with a completely worthless film, if you can call it that, when it's meant to be a powerful message about life and the world we live in, something that you can relate to your own life. It fails outrageously in everything it attempts and in the most pathetic manner. Unfortunately what was attempted is not what cinema is all about, not to me anyway. Thanks for the effort guys (sarcasim), but I went to School and my teachers (especially History teachers) rambled on about stuff like this to me for YEARS, (they didn't make me feel sea sick when I looked at them either) I don't need a film to do it for a further 90 minutes! If you want an adult animation I recommend 'Monkey Dust', it's not particularly philosophical or deep but it's very enjoyable dark, satirical nonsense. As for the philosophical content, well you can quite easily engage in far more interesting philosophical discussions with a group of (at least moderately) educated and/or world weary peers. You may also have the bonus that they might be people you can actually relate to and bare listening to. So go, go and think your own thoughts and dream your own dreams, developing your own views and ideas on important life issues is a far more valuable and enjoyable experience than 'Waking Life'. Philosophy is a participation sport!In Summary, there is no use praising something purely for being creative/ground breaking, in fact this film broke the ground I quite enjoyed standing on, so I am not even mildly tempted to do so, I give it 2 stars. For those who will doubtless tell me to go pack up my brain and watch some action films, well this time I might be tempted to take your advice. At least until the so called 'visionary' directors (and there are hundreds of the little bastards out there) realize that you don't have to bore an audience to death with humour free, depressing, meandering films if you want your work to be considered original and 'thought provoking'. At least action films TRY to entertain the audience! I generally like films that make you think, every now and then I even look for a film that is slightly slow paced and/or depressing for a change, however I do not enjoy films that are so lacking in entertainment, direction and character that they result in extreme boredom. I'm not saying give us constant guns, violence and laughs galore, certainly not, just give us something worthwhile that we can relate to, something that contains a message, some humanity and emotion, something that can make us think AND can enrich our lives in some way!!!

It's about a young man who wanders through a dream, unable to wake up, encountering multiple deep thinkers who pontificate about the meaning of life, the universe, and everything.It's directed by Richard Linklater, who is quite the auteur when it comes to off-beat movies, and it's similar to the director's later film A Scanner Darkly (2005). Waking Life is rotoscope animated, and the result is truly stunning. Often, the tone of a scene is matched by the animation style, which does vary from scene to scene, be it a stark, angular setting or a wobbly, unsettled conversation. It's tough to overstate how technically exemplary this movie is; without the animation, perhaps, the film could seem unaccessible by those who dislike excessive talking in their films. Instead, the visual style complements the dialogue (often, monologue). Think of Waking Life as My Dinner with Andre, only with more characters and compelling art direction. This isn't just two dudes discussing life over dinner; it's practically an out-of-body experience for both the viewer and our protagonist.Among those characters encountered in the movie are Celine (Julie Delpy) and Jesse (Ethan Hawke) from Linklater's \"Before\" trilogy, activist Alex Jones, director Steven Soderbergh, Speed Levitch, actor Caveh Zahedi, composer Guy Forsyth, writer Kim Krizan, and Linklater himself. And did you know that in dreams, if you flip a light switch, nothing happens? That's how you know you're in a dream. Also, in dreams, our brains cannot accurately interpret digital numbers, so an alarm clock looks all weirdly disjointed. Sort of how we feel in a dream, I guess. Our protagonist, played by Wiley Wiggins, wakes up a few times from a dream, only to find he's in another dream. Some serious Inception going on there. He's experiencing lucid dreaming, where he can recognize faces and hold conversations at length and then remember it when he awakes, if that happens. The discussions aren't just about dreams, though; topics include language, existentialism itself, conditioning of the human species, the length of an instant, and reincarnation. Linklater and his cohorts have a way of orating that doesn't come off as so much mumbo-jumbo, or as condescension, or as a lecture. Wondrous to behold, Waking Life is a pensive work of art.",

And an IQ above that of the average Mongoose.  Nothing against Mongeese, by the way.  Some of my best friends... Sorry, digressed a little there.  Richard Linklater has, as you probably already know, shot some footage and then handed it over to the digital art dudes to mess around with.  This, of course, is a brilliant culmination of and comment on the entire CGI-ing of movies, whereby the actors' and director's contribution is lessened once the movie is turned over to the FX guys. What usually results is bland, shiny nonsense with no particular character or flavour or any discernible individuality. In the case of \"Waking Life\", however, we are given a work of true originality, showing just what can be done with digital graphics in the cinema, as well as a thought-provoking treatise on life, philosophy, thought, dreams, relationships, political action, independence and lots of other stuff. In a world where more and more of us feel simultaneously satisfied and alienated, materially comfortable and yet politically uncomfortable, it's desperately important that the art we turn to is not just sappy entertainment that goes in one eye and out the other.  Films like \"Waking Life\" (there aren't many that I know of) deserve to be cherished.  In an ideal world, the people responsible for them would be given obscene amounts of money to make subversive, thought-provoking block-busters.  Or at least they would get nominated for the best animated movie oscar.  Jimmy Neutron - Boy Genius?  SHREK?  Whichever scum are responsible these days for the cretinous freakshow that is the academy awards, I hope they are hanging their heads in shame for neglecting this strange, haunting masterpiece.It's by no means a perfect movie, but it is a genuine original.It deserves to be seen by anyone with a brain.  I hope that includes you. Thanks for reading. Dream on.",

            "content": "This is the single most disappointing movie I've ever seen. I've seen bad movies before, but those never had any expectations before them. This movie is of course written and directed by Linklater, a Texan whose most prestigious film is probably Dazed & Confused. Rightfully so, a nice movie worth watching in the background and jut about people living their life, and being as casual as it may be it manages to be original as well.While Waking Life may be comparable to Dazed & Confused in which there are many characters, all which seem to be laid back, and there's really no actual plot. This works for D&C, but fails horrible for Waking Life.Probably the most appealing factor of Waking Life, and the reason why I considered watching it in the first place, is it's animation. Trailers give away how great the movie does look, but more than 15 minutes of the animation and it's gets boring if not soon queezy in a sense. Liberties are taken with the animation, but to an absurd extent and it feels like it's trying too hard to be artistic (which it of course ends up failing at).The story of Waking Life... well, there really isn't a story to Waking Life. The direction of the movie starts to take precedence after a seemingly fatal incedent with the main character who lacks dialogue almost entirely. After that, we're taken through numerous segments of very tedious dialogue. This is where the fun starts (sarcasm). Five minutes at a time we're introduced to new characters, but it may as well be the same people over and over again, because they somehow manage to say the same thing-- over and over again. Just because people are talking philosophy, doesn't mean they are making any sense, or rather making any actual relevance. For the 'philosophy' these people slate by all the time is usually incredibly useless and theoretical and on top of all that it's far from anything provocative. In fact just about every scene is chock-full of whining where people make blatant observations on everyday life-- moreover, they're observations are hardly anything special.All in all, Waking Life is a highly disappointing movie. The story goes nowhere and in all too long of a time the movie is finally over. If you are considering this movie you might as well watch the trailer, it's probably every bit of the movie shown once without being repeated over for almost 100 minutes. This movie is true showcase of psycho babble from a man stoned out of his gourd, and listening to a stoner talk through his own movie for 100 minutes of borish and anti-climactic cinematics was probably the greatest waste of my time to this day.",

            "content": "This film is about dreams. But it's also about life, death, and what comes after. It's about asking questions that may not have answers. Existentialism, purpose, creativity, perspective... it's all there. Told through a trippy, yet effective animation style that puts viewers themselves in a trance-like, dream state, mirroring that of main protagonist's.The film does not contain a traditional plot arc, but rather is carried by its dialogue, its themes, and the questions and ideas it proposes to the main character, and in turn, to the viewer.With that being said, here are many of my favorite takeaway quotes from the film. Minor spoiler warning ahead; considering this film revolves primarily around its dialogue as I mentioned...\"They say that dreams are only real as long as they last... Couldn't you say the same thing about life?\"\"There's only one instant, and it's right now. And it's eternity.\"\"The quest is to be liberated from the negative, which is really our own will to nothingness. And, once having said yes to the instant, the affirmation is contagious. It bursts into a chain of affirmations that knows no limit. To say yes to one instant, is to say yes to all of existence.\"\"The trick is to combine your waking rational abilities with the infinite possibilities of your dreams. Because, if you can do that, you can do anything.\"\"The reason why I refuse to take existentialism as just another French fashion or historical curiosity is that I think it has something very important to offer us... I'm afraid were losing the real virtues of living life passionately in the sense of taking responsibility for who you are the ability to make something of yourself and feel good about life. Existentialism is often discussed as if it were a philosophy of despair, but I think the truth is just the opposite. Sartre, once interviewed, said he never felt once minute of despair in his life. One thing that comes out from reading these guys is not a sense of anguish about life so much as a real kind of exuberance, of feeling on top of it, its like your life is yours to create. Ive read the post modernists with some interest, even admiration, but when I read them I always have this awful nagging feeling that something absolutely essential is getting left out. The more you talk about a person as a social construction or as a confluence of forces or as being fragmented of marginalized, what you do is you open up a whole new world of excuses. And when Sartre talks about responsibility, he's not talking about something abstract. He's not talking about the kind of self or souls that theologians would talk about. He's talking about you and me talking, making decisions, doing things, and taking the consequences. It might be true that there are six million people in this world, and counting, but nevertheless - what you do makes a difference. It makes a difference, first of all, in material terms, to other people, and it sets an example. In short, I think the message here is that we should never write ourselves off or see each other as a victim of various forces. It's always our decision who we are.\"\"I haven't seen too many around lately... Things have been tough lately for dreamers. They say dreaming is dead, no one does it anymore. It's not dead it's just that it's been forgotten, removed from our language. Nobody teaches it so nobody knows it exists. The dreamer is banished to obscurity. Well, I'm trying to change all that, and I hope you are too. By dreaming, every day. Dreaming with our hands and dreaming with our minds. Our planet is facing the greatest problems it's ever faced, ever. So whatever you do, don't be bored, this is absolutely the most exciting time we could have possibly hoped to be alive. And things are just starting...\"\"A self-destructive man feels completely alienated, utterly alone. He's an outsider to the human community. He thinks to himself, 'I must be insane.' What he fails to realize is that society has, just as he does, a vested interest in considerable losses and catastrophes. These wars, famines, floods and quakes meet well-defined needs. Man wants chaos. In fact, he has to have it. Depression, strife, riots, murder - all this dread. We're irresistibly drawn to that almost orgiastic state created out of death and destruction. It's in all of us. We revel in it. Sure, the media tries to put a sad face on these things and paints them up as great human tragedies. But we all know the function of the media has never been to eliminate the evils of the world - no! Their job is to persuade us to accept those evils and get used to living with them. The powers that be want us to be passive observers, and they haven't given us any other options outside the occasional, purely symbolic, participatory act of voting. \"You want the puppet on the right or the puppet on the left? I feel that the time has come to project my own inadequacies and dissatisfactions into the sociopolitical and scientific schemes, let my own lack of a voice be heard.\"\"There are two kinds of sufferers in this world: those who suffer from a lack of life and those who suffer from an overabundance of life. I've always found myself in the second category. When you come to think of it, almost all human behavior and activity is not essentially any different from animal behavior. The most advanced technologies and craftsmanship bring us, at best, up to the super-chimpanzee level. Actually, the gap between, say, Plato or Nietzsche and the average human is greater than the gap between that chimpanzee and the average human. The realm of the real spirit, the true artist, the saint, the philosopher, is rarely achieved. Why so few? Why is world history and evolution not stories of progress but rather this endless and futile addition of zeroes. No greater values have developed. Hell, the Greeks 3,000 years ago were just as advanced as we are. So what are these barriers that keep people from reaching anywhere near their real potential? The answer to that can be found in another question, and that's this: Which is the most universal human characteristic - fear or laziness?\"\"Do you ever feel that you're observing the world you live in instead of participating in it?\"\"On really romantic evenings of self, I go salsa dancing with my confusion.\"",

The Director managed to go through every single major philosophy, from existentialism to taoism, without even taking a stand or actually try to SAY something.

In a way, it is funny if it were not so depressing watching the emptiness each event leaves on the characters after all is said and done (like a 95% incomplete file download over and over). Using animation was a good touch that further flattens or heightens the mostly trivial moments and forces one to listen to the ultimately pointless dialog. Some argue that there is a philosophy of deep meaning embedded in the dialogs but in the end what good comes of it all? It's life with lots of meat and potatoes, with all the meat picked out.

Opening in these sad and fearful days after sept.11, it celebrates a series of intelligent characters who seek out the meaning of their existence and do not have the answers. At a time when madmen think they have the right to kill us because of what they think they know about an afterlife, which is unknowable, those who don't know the answers are the only ones asking sane questions.*The characters walk around passionately discussing ideas, theories, and life. The movie is beautiful in its visual style. This film seems alive, seems vibrating with urgency and excitement. The animation is curiously realistic. The most difficult thing for an animator may be to capture an unplanned movement that expresses personality. By filming real people and then animating them, \"Waking Life\" captures little moments of real life.****SPOILERS AHEAD****THE PLOTThe film is about a man going from one person to another, trying to wake up from what the film calls a lucid dream. However, is this man dead or is he in a lucid dream? Is anything real or is it a dream?The film talks about philosophy and the meaning of life, but what is the meaning of life? At the end of the film the main character thinks he's awake but then he starts flying to the heavens. Is that a dream or is he dead? Well, near the end the main character talks to yet another character who gives him a detailed account of a dream that he had about the valley of death. Therefore, I associated those two scenes, and maybe when the last character told him to wake up, perhaps he finally stops dreaming and ascends to heaven because he is dead. That's just my theory.Maybe we're dreams, maybe we're memories of a past life, I don't know, but do I know that this is a great film.

I came out of this movie thoroughly unentertained, unenlightened, and unwilling to ever subject myself to the writer/director's work ever again. He did redeem himself with some of his later work, so I eventually relented of my personal boycott of him. But I digress. Waking Life is little more than a self-involved, well-read, mental masturbation fest. Linklater does nothing more than give all of his friends five minutes in front of a camera to narcissistically show off and then attempt (badly) to knit these segments into a movie.On the flip-side, the animation was fantastic, it conveyed the feel and lent itself very effectively to the texture that Linklater was trying for.

            "content": "Whenever a renowned director experiments with the cinematic form or otherwise strays from the mainstream which helped establish them in the first place, the results are usually varied. Sometimes the director happens upon a batch of genius, a remarkable innovation which in some way impacts the industry around the, but other times the director becomes caught up in their own artistic cunning, making the end result too self-indulgent to be anywhere near effective. Richard Linklater's Waking Life is far more on the side of the spectrum of the former, but its occasional foray into the latter is what prevents it from being as tight and effective a piece as it could have been - but either way, so resoundingly different from almost anything which preceded it that it makes for compelling viewing regardless.To not be taken aback by such a distinctly different vision, the film must be viewed with certain expectations in mind, as well as having dispelled certain preconceptions: contrary to initial belief, there is a narrative and continuing storyline, albeit a very loose and often subtle one, punctuated by academics sounding off on their metaphysical areas of expertise, as superbly named protagonist Wiley Wiggins wanders through the uncertain blurring of his dreams and waking life, attempting to differentiate the two and shake himself out of his predicament. And while it is true that the bulk of the film is a series of talking heads (some real life academics, some actors) spewing out philosophical musings, the underlying thematic links, mainly focusing on the notions of free will, the nature of reality, and \"lucid dreaming\" or controlling one's subconscious dream state do prove fascinating, and often open up lines of thought seldomly exposed to public consciousness. With that in mind, there is little question that even for the most tenaciously dedicated viewers, the film will perplex, confuse, and likely even completely lose them at certain times, though there remains an underlying suspicion that, due to its subject matter, this may be Linklater's intention. One is left continually wondering if the staggering thematic content is always meant to make sense or be followed entirely - after a series of intense theoretical philosophical monologues, Wiggins, interacting with a friend claims \"I had a bunch of weird dreams where people were just sounding off about random whatever\", suggesting that to some degree the audience is expected to be lost and that this will not detract from one's experience of the film. Either way, certain threads prove more engaging than others, and it is this intermittent, fluctuating nature that is both the film's greatest strength and most prominent flaw all at once. For every engaging or thought provoking vignette there is the occasional one which either appears so out of place or frustratingly impossible to follow that an inevitable sense of frustration is provoked. Characters drift in and out, often straying entirely from what appears to be the slowly gestating story or point, making the film as a whole feel too patchwork to be anywhere near as effective as it could have been. Again, considering the thematic content of the film there remains a continual unspoken justification for the fluctuating quality of the film (\"it might all be a dream and dreams are nonsensical\"), but such an excuse becomes tiresomely repetitive and eventually fails to hold up. However, Linklater's rotoscoping effect (animating over live action performances) certainly adds to the disorienting, dream state of the film, but the frequently fluctuating animation styles prove distracting and often uncomfortable to watch (the animation of certain characters wavering to the point of inducing nausea), but overall the novelty fails to wear thin, remaining more compelling than irritating. Similarly, the edgy, bizarre score proves entirely right for a film which exemplifies the above qualities, seeming to transport the viewer to an alternate state of reality. Despite the inevitable criticisms, Waking Life remains a feat of staggering intelligence and creativity, a daring testament to the ability of audiences to concentrate and think instead of simply watching explosions or inane soap opera exchanges. While the patchwork of metaphysical ruminations may waver in quality or effectiveness, the stark originality of Linklater's work makes the film endlessly compelling and captivating, even in the midst of the occasional frustration. Simply put, Waking Life is undoubtedly unlike anything the majority of viewers have ever seen before, and for good or for bad, this fiercely unique vision deserves to be commended.-8/10",

These people have won my respect and admiration for having such incredible creative abilities. They've crafted a truly unique piece of art that is undeniably beautiful to look at and experience. The complex, fascinating journey is that of a one Wiley Wiggins, an everyday, sullen young teenager for whom life is suddenly resembling a string of surreal interactions and observations of various characters. These people range from the mundane and long-winded, to the plucky and thought-provoking, to the absolutely strange and endearing. I found myself perfectly engaged in the sometimes intense discussions for which I collected my own thoughts - sometimes disagreeing, but mostly agreeing. I'm a fairly open-minded person, and as such, I think this was a very pleasant experience, as I really love to see these types of scenes that are less action and more just simple, casual talk. Of course, the hypnotic and fluid animation (filtered over scenes that were originally live-action and shot in digital video) only served to heighten the interest, and keep the attention constantly focused on the issues. I must say, a lot of these opinions were extremely refreshing to hear; Richard Linklater should be given tremendous kudos for being able to write and direct such a rich, philosophical milestone. I can understand some of the more confused and hostile reactions towards such an odd, unconventional picture, but to someone who personally relishes the chances some filmmakers take, this risky venture pays big, BIG dividends. If you're not the type of viewer who enjoys being pummeled with an overload of words and abstract thought, this film probably isn't for you. I'm sure it's one of those things you just have to be in the mood for - a mood to be entertained, AND enlightened.",

            "content": "It is rare that a filmmaker can immerse his audience in an exceedingly unique and gripping atmosphere (the last times this happened was with U-Turn, Element of Crime, and Mystery Train) and it is even rarer that a filmmaker can accomplish something miraculous in such an atmosphere. Richard Linklater's Waking Life is that kind of achievement. It was filmed in Austin with live actors and then the footage was digitally animated on Mac Computers. As a result, each image is wildly alive giving the film a dizzying waviness and vibrancy. Describing the effect of this visual style is impossible but what is quite remarkable is that the film is stylized this way for a reason: It is about a young man (Wiley Wiggins) stuck in a dream world (or some sort of alternate reality) meeting dozens over dozens of people on the city streets. These characters talk and talk about fascinating concepts involving philosophy, sociology, exobiology, and, as the movie progresses and our nameless protagonist realizes that he is in a dream, lucid dreaming (the ability to realize that you are in a dream) is discussed more and more. Wiley Wiggins is one of the most underrated actors (his performance in Dazed and Confused is impossible to forget). It is surprising that he can evoke such a complex character when he is not allowed to have any character development in the story; he gives delicate vibes of social awkwardness, fear, and desperation. His lucid dream soon (I'd hate to use this clich\u00e9 but) becomes a nightmare from which he is unable to awaken. In the end of the film, as he flies off into the sky, the tone is bittersweet: he may never be able to wake up but what is better than being trapped in one's endless curiosity? That is the point of the film: it is an exquisite ode to curiosity and what happens when a film encourages curiosity? It is slapped as being pretentious, of course. Some obnoxious critics of the film encourage one to read the philosophies that these characters talk about rather than wasting time watching them talk about these philosophies. What these dunces don't realize is that this film is meant to appeal to a mainstream audience (or at least someone who isn't a philosophy major). Linklater does not dumb-down these philosophies; instead they are filtered through slackers with an extreme amount of love for the material that they talk about. (As for the actors, in the tradition of Slacker, most of them are just interesting Austin locals. Linklater has always believed that what counts in movies is personality rather than multifaceted acting technique. While most of the actors are interesting here, a few of them deliver their dialogue in a horridly lifeless tone of voice that was absent in Slacker.) What could be more fun than a journey like this?",

The film scoffs as much as it expounds; which of the many views you laugh at, which you nod in agreement to and which you blink confused at will depend on you. A lot of the talk is intentionally too deep to make much sense of; other times it's too simple to take seriously. The main draw of this movie is unquestionably it's shimmering, unique and (presumably) painstaking animation, but the style is necessitated by the content.

            "content": "Don't let the animation fool you, I didn't. Waking Life is a film that contains everything you'd want in a film that might make someone think they're watching something really smart but it is nothing remotely special; mainly due to the fact it has nothing of its own to actually offer. Yes, the animation produced through an Apple Mac. of its time is very impressive and yes, the aesthetical quality of realism mixed in with fiction/non-fiction is a different and alternate route for an American film to go down but try as he might, I think director Linklater just about fails here.Throughout the duration of the film, shot on digital video and then rendered into animation, we will visit several people in several different locations and hear what they have to say on life, the universe and everything. The film likes to think it has this primary strand revolving around the idea of dreams and what they mean running throughout but that is only tacked on at the end after several interviews, some laborious and some interesting, have graced the screen. I think it is the structure that is the biggest problem here as well as the visuals that so obviously take precedence over the themes. When the director and everyone else sat down to plan the film, you get the feeling everything regarding the themes and ideas were sort of secondary to how Linklater wanted the visuals and animation to look.We follow a young boy who might be asleep and dreaming; awake and dreaming or who might well have just taken too many drugs \u2013 I pray it isn't the third theory as it will only encourage drug use in fact I'm sure some people will have watched this film under the influence anyway. Throughout the journey we will follow the boy known only as 'Main Character' as he visits a number of people without motivation. All of these people will talk and talk about numerous different subjects to do with elitist theory and other such subjects, blurring whether this is a documentary or a fiction film. The trouble is, everything that these people talk about are either out of context or are already available out there in books anyway. We will cover topics such as 'Contemporary Physical Theory'; we'll engage in a 'Freedom to Live' speech as told by someone else and a young couple will have the old 'Reincarnation' debate upon waking up \u2013 a bizarre and out of sorts place to talk about such a subject in a scene that can only be viewed as an excuse to get Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke in bed together in a Richard Linklater film (Before Sunrise, anyone?) The trouble is, all these arguments are opinionated through the film by people but are they real experts or actors playing out a role and reading a script? Secondly, all these subjects have been written about and debated in previous texts such as books \u2013 you want to know why I don't know anything about 'Contemporary Physical Theory?' because I have no interest in it, as evident because I haven't actively tracked down any books in the past and studied it. So when I get someone talking to the camera (ie; myself) about it, making me feel smaller and less intelligent than they are, I am wasting my time and feeling small in the process. This sensation is evident at least for me, I am sure because during one such segment in which the camera tracks in on an animated cinema screen featuring two people, a new debate opens up. This debate was all about the point of view when watching a film and how the camera directs the eye and the audience watch the action through another means of watching. I recognised this work as Andre Bazin's and sure enough; the character on the right talking notes the work as Bazin's. The point here is that I have tracked down this writing and read it so when I receive this segment, I get something out of it and it feels good \u2013 do those that like this film actually understand every single piece to camera the film offers? I doubt it. I only liked what I understood/have an interest in, most others are probably kidding themselves.I also find the scene in which a browned out author writing in a caf\u00e9 talking about things a little silly. I feel this is writer/director Linklater himself in another form. The author sits there and tells us about a piece that is disconnected and has everyone floating in and out of everything else \u2013 this is clearly Linklater telling (or perhaps reminding) us through a character what his idea for the film is; he is telling us what structure we're literally seeing just in case we're not sure in what can only be labelled as a failsafe attempt to cover up if the film failed. When such an audacious film is made, there is very chance it might fail and this was a silly inclusion that had no place.Waking Life is a film that would have a long haired stoner-buddy talk in depth and at length about dreams and realities etc. It's film in which a young couple would talk about the age old debate to do with reincarnation \u2013 upon waking up. Waking Life relies on its animation to visually get across its 'wow' factor. Much like Shrek, good animation but if anybody over a certain level actually admits to liking it then they are either kidding themselves or have some serious maturing to do. The film is a triumph in its attempt to be a breakaway, artistic experiment but take away the gimmick and it is merely several 'piece to camera' scenes revolving predominantly around subjects you might not usually give ten seconds of your time to.",

First of all, it's visually impressive (though not absolutely mind-blowing as some have said...if you've seen a lot of animation, you've probably seen plenty of stuff this inventive), making the best use of rotoscoping (animated tracing over live-action figures, with animated backgrounds) that I've seen in a feature; it's got a fairly ambitious intellectual conceit (a man who may or may not be on the verge of death throughout the film dreams in a lucid way about what the nature of reality, consciousness, free will, etc really are); it's got great music (by Glover Gill)...what more could you want? Well, for starters, it works out to be not much more than philosophical ramblings, and I think to some extent it wears out its welcome. Now, if you knew me you'd know I often like long movies...I have no problem with a lot of work that a lot of people call \"slow\"; but this was to me too much of the same thing. And some of the observations are facile in a druggy-stoner way that just made me think, who cares? Still, adding it up, I'm thinking about it quite a lot since I watched the excellent, feature-packed DVD a couple of years ago. Another aspect I really liked was the self-referentiality: the film as a whole is very reminiscent of the director's first feature, \"Slacker\", it contains a short scene with Jesse and Celine, the characters from the previous \"Before Sunrise\" that also obviously looks forward to \"Before Sunset\"; the technique used and some of the more fantastic imagery seems now a tryout for last year's rotoscoped Philip K Dick adaptation, \"A Scanner Darkly\", and both Linklater and his good friend (and fellow experimental-at-times filmmaker) Steven Soderbergh make appearances. And there's a scene or two late in the film that is reminiscent of the work of another extremely self-referential artist, the experimental American SF writer Samuel R. Delany (specificially, his 1000-page Joycean \"Dhalgren\").I need to see it again; reading some pretty intelligent reviews this afternoon leads me to believe that a deeper reading would be more rewarding. Despite many reservations, I'm giving it high marks simply for attempting subject matter and film techniques that nobody else in America seems interested in. Linklater has proved himself a great disciple of European art cinema, not just the usual Scorsese-Coppola-DePalma stuff, and that's all to the good.",

While watching the film it was as though I was dreaming. I could not really process the film but I let it just slide all over me and then later I thought about the implications of the film. How can we know whether we are dreaming? Are our lives real? If we were dreaming, would we know? One observation by the character who I believe was dressed in the manner of an everyday kind of guy, maybe he was a musician too; I remember he was sitting in a big, spacious room and I think there were a couple of other older guys in the room. Anyway, the character said that if you can control your dreams, that's progress in controlling your dream state. In which case, it would be recognition that you are dreaming. And I'm sure that many of us have done that. I know I have, particularly if a hot woman was involved in the dream :) Anyway, this was obviously a labor of love for Linklater. He employs some of his regular actors and as a former resident of the great city of Austin, it was great to recognize many of the locations where he shot. Linklater is an American original; maybe not of Jarmusch's stature yet; well, definitely not, but his films are always worth checking out; whether you like them or not, he's an original. This is strikingly original, visually, and a thought-provoking film unlike any you've ever seen, I'd hazard a guess. Sort of like Austin actually.",

A scandal this past summer (in which an overzealous marketer made up several glowing reviews for a below average film), revealed the existence, of the `Quote Whores'.  These are reviewers who will write a good review for a film and may then get favorable treatment from the studio in the future (private screenings, etc).  While it may not be illegal (smells like payola to me), it definitely borders on immoral and certainly triggers the cynic in me when I come across a glowing review. \nWatching a film at 10:00 am is tough enough (I am not a morning person), but a lousy night's sleep, makes it far more challenging.  As it turns out, I was in the ideal state of mind for the screening at hand.  `Waking Life' is an unconventional film with only the barest bones of a plot \u0096 the main character is asleep and can't seem to wake up.  In his journey to reenter a waking state, he floats from dream to dream, hoping that the next segue will relieve him.  Filmed as live action, each dream sequence was then animated by one of the thirty animators on the project, some with vastly differing styles.  Unconventional doesn't necessarily mean better.The animation techniques range from simple tracings of the cells in which the characters are easily identifiable (the sequence with Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy has barely been altered) to surrealist fantasies that make you wonder if the creator had some hallucinogenic inducements.  The dynamic styling of the sequences is visually stimulating, sometimes bordering on overwhelming, but your attention is constantly drawn to the screen.   Had they chosen to run these images with an equally bombastic soundtrack this film would be absolutely riveting.  At least it would have drowned out the dialogue.Each `dream' is discussion between new characters that try to divine the meaning of dreams.  The discussions touch on myriad esoteric topics ranging from existentialism, cosmology, freewill, determinism, to Gnosticism.  Very cerebral stuff, and interesting \u0096 to some.  I was caught up in several of the conversations, such as the concept of lucid dreaming, where one character mentions that you know you're in a dream when you can't adjust the lighting levels (something I've been trying without success).  Other discussions however prove to be so abstruse that the most fervent philosophy student would run screaming for the exits, or slip into their own dream states. Waking Life is an adventurous film that will draw the art house/Mensa crowd wherever it plays and should elicit deserved `oohs' and `aahs' for its visual imagery.  The film may even spark some discussion at the coffee houses afterwards.

The narrative is made up of conversations and lectures from real people(often actors playing actors and professors playing professors, etc), who were then animated over, in technology developed specifically for this film(now being seen advertisements). The subject of these dream discussions include identity, free will, evolution, language, rebellion, apathy, conversation, sex, film, God, death, dreams, memories, etc. Some vignettes are funny, some disturbing, some pretentious, some relaxed engaging, some didactic, some inquisitive, and others more like poems aborted mid-stream. This is not a plot driven film, it's a series of vignettes not unlike an earlier Linklater film \"Slacker\"(if you liked this movie, Slacker is the 90's no-budget equivalent). If you enjoy thinking for thinking's sake, putting ideas together and then taking them apart like building blocks, you will enjoy this movie. Few films have had quite the impact on me that this did the first time around, I showed it to just about everyone I knew, and while a few gave me the standard \"What the f*&k is this, s*&t's weird\", more than a few were left just as blown away as I was. Cynics will of course associate this film with a coffee shop, no attention span culture, jittering pretentious ideas being typed a mile a minute by spectacled hipsters, etc. However this is an unfortunate reduction of a film, that has generated more interesting ideas in it's first 15 minutes alone than most film's do after years of academic discussion. Watching this movie made me feel aware for the first time, that I was no longer living in the 20th century, that things were and could be different, and that new languages and systems would have to be made to describe and implement new experiences and new ways of doing things, this movie was the beginning... perhaps I was getting a bit ahead of myself, but that's what I liked about this movie, it's own grandeur, ridiculousness, and ambition are infectious and life affirming, where often films of this artistic caliber can be obtuse or de-humanizing. There are no characters to empathize here with, just ideas and beautiful visuals(from dozens of animators with varying styles), so if your not to interested in the discussion you can always just tune out and watch the colors dance, it's as much a treat for the eyes as it is a delight for the brain, as well as ears, the \"Tosca Tango Orchestra\" perform the music, which keeps everything swirling at a nice pace.

By having Waking Life open these doors, the possibilities are unlimited. But instead of really transporting the audience the way that 2001: A Space Odyssey did in 1968, the overall effect feels like a 500-level college philosophy lecture class.That is the main problem with this film, it starts out by displaying an unconventional and revolutionary method of film animation that hasn't been attempted before and starting the audience off with the phrase: \"Dream is Destiny.\" Okay, so we're in for a surrealistic journey, cool. But then we're introduced to the conventional way of opening up a film with a journey by having the main character be picked up in a boat/car and dropped off \"where he needs to be.\" From there, the main character is hit by a car and wakes up to have people lecturing to him in long and drawn out monologues. By this point, the film has see-sawed from unconventional to conventional back to being unconventional, never deciding if it wants to have a direction, or play like and animated documentary. The audience isn't interacted with, it's talked down to from a vacuous script posing as intellectualism.Fine, so you want to be a lecture film. What will the lecture be? Pretty much, simple stuff that anyone with half a mind and an open ear had heard before. So where does this \"experience\" of a film take us? Really nowhere. The film seems to want the audience to make up their own mind about what was \"lectured\" to them (as if the people who generally make up the audience for these type of empty existential indie flicks have never sat through a long and drawn out philosophy discussion before). But as for the character whose journey we are supposed to follow, he comes to no realization or achieves any kind of catharsis, he simply \"floats away.\" Overall, \"Waking Life\" is ingeniously designed, but overall an empty experience that plays as if someone animated an adaptation of a philosophy book that has already been covered. So this film gets my Zyrtek Indie Film Award, which is handed out to filmmakers with good concepts, but turn out to be self-proclaimed indie geniuses who mourn the fact that they are in a position that millions of film students wish they were in. These \"artists\" seem to enjoy writing movies about figuring life out when they seem to hardly grasp it themselves and instead sink into a quagmire of frustration, disillusionment, self-loathing which leads to self-praise (a cycle which seems endless for them) which overall leads to their clinical depression. Previous recipients of this award include Wes Anderson (Rushmore) and Lars von Trier (Dancer in the Dark). But a three out of four star film nonetheless, if only for the well-designed and well-meaning animation.",

            "review_title": "Waking Life",
            "content": "\"Super perfundo on the early eve of your day.\" We get what we want out of most movies; we get good guys and bad guys, lines of dialogue that make us think, romantic playfulness, maybe some laughs and/or tears, and we walk away feeling as though we have experienced some sides of life that we wish that we had more time to explore in our own. We also, of course get some stuff that we don't want, like bad acting that distracts us, overwrought plots that deceive us, characters that we think we could either have gone without or wish that we could take home with us. Nonetheless, movies are our escape and as much as we dislike admission that we see a lot (maybe too many), sometimes it's exactly what we need.So, with that being said about the art of drama, we can now also look at the other side of film-making. The documentary has been another element in film, that has existed since the invention of the camera. The early part of the 20th century, for example was filled with propaganda pieces as well as informational and exploratory films. Fact, as opposed to fiction, has the mirror effect of education in the movie-making business. Here, we see that although a broad brush has painted film as an escape, another canvas has exposed a return to reality. Important to note, of course, is that there aren't a substantial amount of documentaries that attempt to encompass the entirety of human existence. Documentaries, instead, tend to focus on a particular area of study, compiling both facts and opinions that are intended to give us glimpses of those parts of life that we can be unconsciously overlooking in our daily routines.In not only providing the audience with entertainment in realistic ways, but letting the same audience come to points of interest at their own pace and retain their abilities of judgment and thought, you might wonder how much of an escape is actually being given to people in need of such. Especially in a time of world disaster, poverty, repression, and terrorism, you might expect that we'd be seeing the better part of ourselves wanting to forget, to regret mistakes, to live in an alternate dimension of purity in wholesome rehabilitation.However, we have gotten somewhat of a different reaction from a variety of places.\"It's up to each and every one of us to turn loose of just some of the greed, the hatred, the envy, and yes, the insecurities, because that is the central mode of control, make us feel pathetic, small, so we'll willingly give up our sovereignty, our liberty, our destiny.\"\"Waking Life\", points out that there is no need to seek truth, when subjectivity will ultimately confuse our relations. It takes a seldom traveled path, where we accept that we will meet people whose ideas may have evidence but whom we will never be able to share even what amounts to a single shared experience in life. It's not because they don't intrigue us, or that the concepts they speak about don't ring bells. Only because we have the understanding that life is temporal do we learn to move on.Through the idea that we have the ability to lucid dream in a state of unconsciousness, we can learn without processing thoughts or having recognition of natural instinct and rely on intuition alone. Often we have dreams with themes, some so progressed that they will reappear. This film exhibits the message that as a consequence of us contrasting existence with existentialist thought, it will undoubtedly result with conflicting viewpoints, in the way it was translated onto video, alone. Taken from an actual film crew with camera equipment, and then given to the hands of enhanced creative animation illustrators. The improvised yet informed and intellectual conversations become rhythmic with personal impressions whose sole works are our personal complexities inherited through time itself. However, we never lose sight of the fact that pedestrians exist if only as members of an eternal connection who can perceive the emotion.It is with this film that instead of unwarranted commitment and loyalty we are assisted with the inward reflection of values, and learn the virtuous curiosity which accompanies the purpose of change through life, and ultimately the afterlife. We learn that the quest is what with as complete authenticity as the dream of life, under the constant conditions of time and truth, personifies the undefined belief system. There have been multiple instances of generation, yet the eternal beginning is enough that we have experience of the essence of life long before we even have science or reference.This is the interpretation that I choose, that many critics have overlooked. I propose that the theme of this movie is more about birth than death. \"Waking Life\", although based on the extremity of uncertainties, is in my eye, less than guaranteeing the prophecy of the end to our human spirit. It isn't even guessing that you'll die without knowing the grandness of our universe. It is quite simply telling you that you'll always be positive of your soul's origin, everything that will happen to you is a prescription of morality, with decreasing potency as distance increases, until the inevitably and infinitely mysterious unforeseeable end of action. The film, in my opinion, implies that we are witnessing the poetic birth of a soul into the sphere of life.All in all, Linklater has broken the mold of film production. His reminiscent air of nostalgia for the loss of time as golden as spent, does justice to the robbers of the human spirit, as the emotional outlook that captures us all when we look into the eyes of a photo album and feel the burden of a succession of guilt over the advancement of dreams.\"Dream is destiny.\" \"Waking Life\" (2001) 10/10",

            "content": "A negative review writes itself. Oft penned by Philosophy graduates whom couldn't bear another lecture. But for serious cinefiles and owners of the Slacker Criterion DVD, Waking Life is off for a different reason. DVD supplemental outtakes from all of Richard Linklater's films drawn out to feature length and animated. With the director's tag \"an experimental film told in an experimental way\". It is neither. Starting with technique: The program used was not far removed from Adobe Flash, which over the last 7 years has revolutionised animation. Enabling anyone with a computer to animate professional quality shorts and have them seen on the world stage through the internet. Linklater shot the \"film\" on a bog-standard 'baby's first steps/wedding video' DV camera, and left the animating to a rather large consort of animators (par for the course for any animation student). Some knew the program layout and limitations, but showed rudimentary animation skills, whilst the opposite is obvious of others. In one scene eyes move independently of the head, background elements like cars are rendered as blue and red blobs, and the constant motion of things will make you seasick. The individual stamp of each animator it not evident when the majority were simply tracing around the lines out of inexperience. Some animators used the format to animate the philosophies and give life to an otherwise bland lecture, which is only really successful in two scenes. Linklater and crew were so keen to be first out of the gate that they didn't tie their laces, running a production that was unfolding as it went along had them tripping over each other.It wasn't uncommon for animation students to film a day in their mundane lives, tack on existentialism and obscure music, spend a few weeks rotoscoping and present the finished short as an end of year project a few years before this \"film's\" release. In keeping with all of Linklater's work, it can not help feeling like an overblown student project. Like The Matrix, it was new-ish technique exacerbated in a feature trying to justify its own existence. Smoke and mirrors.The philosophies and theories are presented at elementary level. Some by professors, others by obnoxious left-wing radio DJs and actors. This isn't \"pretentious\", it's patronising. Cut from a balding Prof. to a deleted scene from Slacker or Before Sunrise. Going from a man who's put in years of study to a glib actor reciting Linklater's own half-baked drivel. Wiley Wiggins plays the gormless stoned adolescent \"Wh..Wha?\" As surrogate audience member he is perfect. It is hard to imagine anyone over nineteen wanting to see a repackaging of Slacker (without the charm of 90's zeitgeist to carry it). That aside, Waking Life isn't memorable. You won't quote it, you won't question or evaluate its philosophies or be moved by the flat ending.Richard Linklater, like his fanboy Kevin Smith, comes from a generation of stunted growth. Just as Smith never grew out of prepubescence, Linklater never grew out of first-year college enthusiasm. A never ending headache of quotes out of context, glib sound bites said in a monotone desperately searching for pitch. At his age, it is embarrassing to witness.",

Richard Linklater, in more ways than one, has attempted what seemed almost unfeasible prior to the completion of this film. It is both a technical feat in that it was all done using rotoscopic animation, and an aesthetic feat in surrealist filmmaking. I think that the film's main thematic component is sketched for us in the opening sequence, in which a little girl, reading from a handmade (from construction paper) 'fortune-telling device' profoundly states \"Dream is destiny.\" With this film, Linklater is basically reminding us not to take life too seriously (hence the use of children, construction paper in this scene), because we know nothing more of it than that which we can understand of our own inscrutable dreams.",

            "content": "Richard Linklater's Waking Life is a lengthy series of strung-together monologues and other scenes featuring pop philosophy and Reader's Digest versions of several age-old metaphysical and epistemological ideas about the nature of reality. The film centers, perhaps, on the protagonist's main dilemma - that he believes himself to be caught in a multi-layered dream and can not wake up. His attempts to seek help result in the lengthy, quasi-intellectual discourses that comprise the bulk of the film.These discourses could have been lifted from Linklater's first film, the excellent \"Slacker\". Many of the scenes, despite the rotoscope animation technique, are paced, scripted and filmed exactly as Slacker was, and some even involve actors which appeared in Slacker. The major differences between Slacker and Waking Life are the fact that Waking Life has an identifiable theme which serves as a loosely arranged plot, and Slacker is not animated. Slacker functions best as an introduction to the postmodern, anti-responsibility ethic permeating intellectual life around the University of Texas at Austin. Like the dream-state of Waking Life's main character, Linklater does not seem able to fully extricate himself from this cultural milieu.The rotoscope animation technique is interesting and adds a lot of visual interest to the film. The acting is terrific, but the script bases character development on the philosophical content of the soliloquies, leaving out most non-verbal communication and giving each character essentially the same discursive style, delivery and pacing. Only two characters are actually developed - \"Main Character\" (Wiley Wiggins) and \"others\" (everybody else in the film). Ultimately, it is not easy to care a great deal about what happens in the film because, throughout it, the main character's dream-state may result in a radical revision of everything at any given moment.Waking Life could have been the great, innovative film that many believe it to be. Unfortunately, the script's monotony and overemphasis on pretentious, pop-philosophical epistemological exposition detract from the film's artistry. Linklater should have, at least, collaborated on this script. He needed many more than one voice, and a lot more than a few forms of delivery to get this set of messages across.",

Though centered around a young man who is unable to wake from what he perceives to be his dream state, the real meaning and true essence of the film is exhibited by the distinctly, and at times opposing, varying philosophies attempting to explain why we perceive things the way that we do.  Sometimes they use science, while others use religion; as the young man continues his journey through his own mind.  Leaning a great deal towards the stranger side of philosophy, this film isn't for everyone, I highly enjoyed the animation that appeared in the film because I felt like it added a great deal to the ambience and helped better explain the feel of the young man's endless waking; however some people found it to be a big distraction.  If you are some how put off at all by the idea that they filmed this movie and then had people animate it, then I would recommend that you don't even try to sit through this because the camera work and constantly shifting art styles will not amuse you.  Anyone into experimental art should really enjoy his film, the art work is at times exquisite and at others' poignantly shaky and sloppy.  The artwork is perfectly suited for the film and I think that they did a really excellent job casting the roles for this movie, because you can make out a couple of people but they don't really look like themselves so you never get that feeling of watching a movie with actors in it, making the message that much more guided and inevitable.",

            "content": "Filmed as an indie quickie before going through its arduous and peculiar rotoscoping process in post, Waking Life is Richard Linklater's 2001 ode to the existential. Wiley Wiggins plays... well, who-knows-who, a young man drifting through a series of encounters with a range of characters (played by various actors including Linklater regulars Ethan Hawke, Julie Delpy and Adam Goldberg), all delivering unto him dense philosophical monologues or dialogues. The plot is as faint as a half-remembered dream; although it is implied that Wiggins' protagonist is killed by a car at the start, and I got the sense that in that terminal moment he is recalling a series of profound human moments throughout his life. If nothing else, the wispily connected scenes provide an accessible introduction to modern philosophy, covering topics such as free will, human potential, neuroscience, time, and the self. The only vaguely mainstream movie I can think of which is comparatively philosophically dense would be Cosmopolis, although Linklater's film doesn't have the emotional payoff of Cronenberg's. Fans of A Scanner Darkly (Linklater's 2006 Philip K Dick adaptation) will be familiar with the art technique he uses here. Sometimes it appears to be a simple case of watercolour-style painting over filmed imagery, but as the narrative progresses the pictures become more surreal and nightmarish; so, we're left with a range of styles from impressionist to minimalist to Gilliam-esque animated madness. Obviously Waking Life is hugely indulgent (Linklater even gives himself the climactic speech) but I don't see this as a criticism. The script comes across like a desk drawer full of scribbled ideas because it probably was. But what ideas they are, interrogating notions of memory, identity, and dream logic with skill and clarity. Only on occasions does the writing stray into condescending territory \u2013 the suggestion, for example, that we're all sleepwalkers who'll \"sell our souls for minimum wage\" is clich\u00e9d. More often than not, though, the words make us think. Crucially, they make us think for ourselves. Waking Life was made prior to 11 September 2001, yet released in October. \"A new world is possible,\" one character says, oblivious to the cynical new world that was to come. I find there is a sadness in Waking Life's hopefulness about human potential. Toward the end it puts forward the idea that life may be but a dream after death \u2013 a moving metaphysical thought that seems somehow too abstract for a post-9/11 world; a world which has seen the Dream turned sour.",

I don't know if there was original camera work done and then animation on top of it, but the movement and expression of the body was so complete that it made me wonder, because I've never seen any animation capture people so completely. The plot, if it has one, was workable, but it's not really the kind of movie that needs a plot since it's just a man searching for understanding. The movie is very very wordy. It's all words. At some point I started to feel it was pretentious, but because it was such a movie to behold, I was happy to keep going. I even lost track of the time. My only real beef is that they do so much talking that seems so deeply theoretical that there is no effort made to make it easier to digest or summarize. That was probably intentional though; an effort to be 'uncompromizing' in its intellectual offerings to the viewer. The broad cast of characters offers so much to see and hear. Anyway, I loved it, but at some point I felt bored with the relentless talking and captivated with everything else. 7/10",

            "content": "I read a book that called \"The Matrix\" the most philosophical movie ever made...clearly, they haven't seen this.  The plot of \"Waking Life\" is exactly the opposite of its title: a character exploring his dreams...or is it a dream?  Are 'dreams' really our waking state and are we just dreaming what we think is our waking state?  One of the many question posed in this brilliant blend of philosophy, science, theories, fantasy, music, drama and animation.First I'd just like to say that I don't know if I'd label this movie as an animated one, or at least a cartoon.  After all, movies like \"The Lord of the Rings\" and \"The Matrix\" that are filmed almost entirely on green screen aren't labeled as animated flicks because computers were used just to create the locations.  The same goes with this film, seeing that it takes place in a dream, computers were used to effectively create a dream world.Anyway, that's not really important.  This, in nature, is a truly episodic film.  It follows Wiley Wiggins as he explores his dream life, meeting character after character, them speaking about things like the meaning of life, creationism, evolution, politics, reincarnation, the media, and so much more.  He talks to a woman who thinks humans are like ants, a woman who thinks creationism was invented because of feelings humans are unable to express through words, etc.  And it doesn't just lightly touch on these topics, it goes deep - really deep into them.Because of the mix of animation, fantastical elements, some plain weird characters and some great settings, when the ninety-nine minutes are over it feels like you just woke up from a dream.  What's also notable is how writer-director Linklater is so focused on keeping his movie like a dream, exactly like a dream.  There are some segments where Wiley isn't even present - just like how in our dreams we may feel we're not there.This is an amazing film on all accounts.  When you think about all the dialogue Linklater wrote, all the actors who had to memorize it, Linklater's direction with a digital camera, all the animators who had to perfect that. There is not a single aspect that isn't touched with completeness and detail.An amazing, astounding film that makes you think more than any other, 8.5/10.",

I find it impossible to accept that these are not real people recorded having real conversations. There is a lot of subtle humor and irony woven into the film, like first the \"boat captain\" denying he had met the main character before, with the main character getting frustrated in his low-key way, and then later the main character denying he had seen the amorous girl before, when WE certainly can't forget that intense but wordless encounter.Among all the literary and quotation references peppered throughout the film, I was surprised the famous Poe poem, Dream Within a Dream, received no mention. After all, the umbrella theme of the film is an attempt to answer Poe's question.I shall now seek out all the rest of Linklater's films.",

Linklater uses a multitude of animators (about thirty) and they lend fascinating perspectives to the talk (again, all talk) that alternately illuminate and parody the conversations; the result is about as entertaining a presentation of various philosophies as you can get. This time, the ideas are abstract--only a couple of conversations are based on experience--but Linklater sets them in a lucid order, ranging from existentialism to evolutionary theory to finally the conclusion that life and death are an indistinguishable dream state that ultimately provides individual freedom. It's true there's a lot of pretension mixed with the profundity but there's also a refreshing humor provided by the animators that allows a certain relief from the earnestnestness and even Linklater allows a certain winking irony. (One of his characters admits `we're all theory and no action.') It's a film that requires multiple viewings in order to get comfortable with it but the effort is well worth it: this is a vital blend of creativity in a variety of arts (including Glover Gill's delightfully experimental tango score) mixed with some of the more rigorous thinking to be presented in a film.",

Overall, this is a very impressive accomplishment.One common fallacy that I have observed in several of these philosophical films is the argument that physical determinism undermines free will, such an argument is fallacious because free will means that an individual can make decisions based on his own mind, his mind operates according to physical laws so, in principle, in a deterministic universe we could predict the decisions made by individuals before they make these decisions but that's not a proof of inexistence of free will. Also, quantum mechanics do not mean that the universe is not deterministic since the probability distributions follow deterministic laws: quantum mechanics is just an extension of the deterministic view of the universe to the quantum level. Free will has nothing to do with quantum mechanics.Well, at least this movie made me think about those subjects, that is quite interesting.

In each of  these dreams, the man finds himself in conversation with or looking in on a variety of deep thoughted people who have perspectives on life, death and why we're really here.Wiley Wiggins (Mitch Kramer from \"Dazed and Confused\") gives a good performance as the dream-woven main character.  There are also several brief but very good perfomances in the movie, including Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy in an update on what happened two their characters Jesse and Celine in \"Before Sunrise\".  The animation (shot on regular film and then animated over) offers a beautiful dreamlike feel while you're watching it, as does Linklater's always great scenes of dialogue and direction.If you're in the mood for a really thought provoking film or you're just a big Richard Linklater buff, I highly recommend \"Waking Life\".",

            "content": "I don't know much about the director, and I am surprised that it seems to be so important for so many. Who cares about the director or his other movies? The reviews should be about THE MOVIE, not attempts to convince anyone of the quality of the movie based on the persona of the director.So, what kind of movie is this? For me it is a movie that is supposed to make you think, using extensive philosophical dialog and great innovative animation techniques. (Yeah, yeah, I know that they filmed this movie with a real camera and then edited it digitally, but who cares? The result is an animated movie, period.) The animation is great. It is innovative, memorable, and the original idea itself is implemented really well. The animation has a great effect on the perception on the reality of the movie, because on one hand, the eye sees that everything is drawn, but on the other hand, every scene seems very real because of the specific way the images move around each other. It is kind of like old memories: you remember approximately what has happened, but all the sharp details are gone of course, and what you have left are silhouettes of objects that move around in almost the same way as they do in Waking Life.This effect is especially appreciated when one of the films themes are dreaming, reality and how we can tell the difference.Now, the movie's philosophical message is told through numerous ideas, monologues of different people, kind of like every person's view of the world. And I can even understand what the filmmakers were trying to do with having so many different small ideas presented: the movie itself is kind of like a dream, with many small peaces that supposedly only the subconscious mind can piece together to make a deep philosophical impression. Great idea! But the biggest problem of this film is that ideas themselves are stupid! Not because I don't understand them, but because as a normal thinking person that talks to other people, I have thought through most of the ideas presented myself, and in much more deep way than they are presented in the movie. It is like if you would come up to a priest and ask him \u201chey, have you ever thought that there can be some supernatural force that governs all of the world?\u201d. So those of you who write here that this movie has changed your lives and you started thinking in other ways, it simply means that you haven't spent a single second in your past thinking about anything philosophical. I don't think the ideas are stupid because I don't understand them, I think they are stupid because they are so basic, that a 12-year old could comprehend them in a second.Plus, some ideas are plainly stupid, incomplete and are based on faulty assumptions: The guy driving around, megaphoning about the society \u2013-- I guess he never studied any history and I hope for him to go back to the anarchy of feudal times and finally understand what good does the society give us.Ethan Hawke + a girl talking about how believing in reincarnations means that only one in 6 people should technically be able to have been reincarnated from someone else in the past \u2013-- not everyone in the world claims that they have been reincarnated, much less than a sixth of the population, so they could as well be that sixth part of the population that actually have been someone else in the past.\u201cThere is no difference between dreaming a perception and actually the waking perception of an action\u201d --- Seriously, who hasn't thought of that? I was hoping the guy would expand it but he never did.The guy talking about humans being deterministic clockworks and that there is no free will \u2013-- the idea is as old as the scientific paradigm and one could still argue that a complicated deterministic design does not mean that there is no free will.\u201cWords are inert and much of our perceptions are unspeakable, and we don't know if we really understand anyone else\u201d --- well, yeah, and also, a shocking news, the whole world can be in your imagination, you could be the only person alive, and you could never tell because your perceptions are the only thing you have access to.And yes, I am aware of the fact the movie does not tell us that every idea it presents is true, valid or even appropriate, it just gives us some different points of view of different people, leaving it to us to piece everything together, and it makes it a little better, but still, when you hear such nonsense ideas, it is difficult to like the movie.Overall, there are some good ideas, the graphical representation is original and well performed, but this movie is a little too simple for me. Although it is not a 1/10 as many others may say, some of the things I must give credit for. There is no plot or action, but one could make a decent movie without them.The only thing I couldn't really place was why the movie constantly presented us with points of view of general \u201closers\u201d, drunks, junkies, people that seem unemployed and without any particular meaning in life, and so on. Not only does the movie present those people, it emphasizes on them. Was it a try to make ordinary people identify with the movie? Is it a Nietzsche-like message about how most people live like animals and never achieve to anything? Or does is it a way to question if the values the society is trying to teach everyone aren't as valid as we think? Even thou I have some theories about that, for me it just seems weird and misplaced.",

There's no distinguishable plot to be found here, only people discussing their diverging philosophical, scientific or just practical approaches on the matter of being awake and/or dreaming - but don't expect any conclusions. For the receptive mind Linklater's film for sure is an engrossing, sometimes also dizzying trip through a lucid dream world, a journey to be savored, and especially the visuals are whole adventures in themselves.The film however lacks the dynamic which its trailer suggests, and neither is there any Iggy Pop in it.

Colorful, bouncy and seemingly alive, it dances across the screen with hidden messages, floats through your psyche with philosophical brilliance and pulls you in through human intrigue.I truly loved this movie, if not for the mere art of it all, for the bravery of Linklater to throw a film out there without a plot.  Yep, that's right, no plot to be found, but a wonderful few days (or dreams) in the life of the main character (Wiley Wiggins) who spends his days walking around talking to interesting characters and having unique experiences (like driving down the road in a boat).  Eventually Wiggins realizes that he's dreaming, only to later realize that he can't wake up.  I'm also impressed with Linklater's ability to find a way to make it all feel dreamy and surreal, while wrapping the message up in a spiritual/lucid dreaming/philosophical sandwich.There aren't many movies that I love.  There aren't many ideas out there that are new, or at least presented in new and interesting ways.  This movie isn't for everyone, but is a great and rare find for those who dabble in self-exploration, new-age ideas, philosophical enjoyment, dreaming, reality or any of the pressing human mysteries.  Plot or no plot, there is plenty of meaning to be found in this flick.",

It's a hauntingly beautiful mix of cutting edge animation, philosophy, and eerie, almost spooky atmosphere. There is no story outside of the main character going to many strange people and discussing the origins of dreams and what they mean in today's world. I enjoyed the slow pace, the quirky characters, and many of the ideas that are presented. Some theories are complex, but after a couple more viewings I started to understand what some of the characters were talking about. Also, you can't beat Waking Life when it comes to art. They shot the entire thing in live action, then went back with computers to 'paint' over the actors. The whole thing looks like a swirly, blobby, insanely psycadelic painting, and really adds to the whole dream thing. You can actually be hypnotized by the visuals of this film, getting drowzy while not wanting to miss any of it. Also, the music is very memorable. Usually I don't enjoy orchestral soundtracks, but after watching WL I really want to hear its symphonic tunes again and again. You may have a hard time finding this, but if you really have an obsession involved with animation or enjoy debating over life, death, and whatnot, then do yourself a huge favor and rent (then buy) Waking Life. It's not one to miss. ****/****",

I have seen this movie a few times and every time I see it I'm surprised at how much I still enjoy it and am fascinated with some ideas that are addressed. Each character is unique and interesting. Many are over the top and done intentionally. The animation of the movie gives it the ability to surpass what can be accomplished with live action only. Speaking of the animation, it is the first time that I had seen a film done in that way. It was very interesting and new to me at the time. I really like the way that everything is intertwined through the movie. I guess a case could be made that it is more random than a flowing arc, but I feel that it can be perceived in whichever flow the audience desires to view it in. I think a lot of people can be harsh on this movie because they think the filmmakers were holding a \"look at us, we're smart and making a movie about philosophy\" mentality, which I feel is really a shame.

Freedom to develop our personality beyond social norms and stereotypes. Movie that I watch for the sixth time, and whose poster stood instead my profile picture on Facebook. The film, which gave me to understand that I am finally on way that is meant only for me.Facing different approaches to life, it is embodiment of different possible lives. Showing the action in a unique innovative technology (and yet every place and every character is absolutely true). The action runs! as a sleep. Definitely a philosophical approach.Convergent themes of responsibility, creativity, language, communication, evolution, revolution, politics, loneliness, revenge, fate, science, dreams and cinema. Protesting against depersonalization and turning others into foreigners. Looking for the other as unique person and treating him in a respectful way.In general it laid the foundations to answer the questions of who we are, and who I am. Is it everything real or not, am I waking up to the sobriety of thinking? Am I saying yes to life, while many people refuse to do so? And when they finally decide to say yes, life tells them his no, which is the final no of death (as in Kafka's Before the Law).Somehow studental, surreal, unconventional and yet very interesting. After three years I will most likely watch it for the seventh time.http://vihrenmitevmovies.blogspot.com/",

I can't see low-brow conservatives getting much out of it.I found only a fraction of the material the least bit dull; the parts that veered too much into speculation and supernatural elements. The scene with the couple in bed had one of those moments. The \"puzzle\" story seemed too far out to be true (as it was implied). I don't think philosophy needs to exceed the laws of nature.The only thing I really didn't like was the excessively wavy animation in some sequences (the people and backgrounds rarely stand still). Some of the floating layers and shifting lines led to dizziness and distracted from the content. They could have toned down the overall shakiness about 30% and still maintained the dream-state look. How they pulled off the animation (technically) was itself part of the interest.\"Waking Life\" is definitely worth seeing, and one of few films I'd want to watch more than once in short order to figure it out better.

God knows nothing can rankle me more than doped-up caffeinated rich brownnosing snobs speaking about Nieztsche and Heidegger over lattes. Actually, my father says Plato had advised students not to take philosophy until they were over 30, because they hadn't really lived yet.  It seems to show in the ecstasy of the older men waxing philosophical vs. the zombie-like incantations of the young ones in discussing philosophy.\n   I went to an extremely intellectual college out near Philly, and there were many times I loved the brand of late-night questioning involved in this movie.  (You can actually enjoy this stuff sober and straight if you're in the right mood.)  I in fact read the Philip K. Dick novel five years ago, \"Flow my Tears the Policeman Said\" and loved it.  However, after my father got fired from his job and my mother get stressed from her work, and given some time abroad in South America, and a bad breakup, I became really impatient with philosophy.  Even scientific curiosity in general.  To some degree, I continue to be.  I wish some people spent half as much time volunteering as they did wasting their lives away wondering what they ought to do for self-fulfillment.\n   There are some comforting things to be found though in \"Waking Life.\"  In addition to some very well-played monologues, like the red-faced prisoner, the diatribe of the man in the car, the dream-masters, the \"ant\" encounter, the weirdo on the bridge, there emerges a very real panic by the narrator about whether or not he can wake up from his drifting.  This theme emerges constantly in films these days, The Matrix, Truman Show, American Beauty, Fight Club, in Americans who are just numb, passive, drifting, or locked into habits that they just can't seem to snap out of.  I liked the way the drifter increasingly starts looking for a way to wake up, how he questions if he's perhaps died.\n   I think a lot of us feel stuck, frustrated these days, especially those of us being laid off, or wondering what kind of direction the country's taken.  I don't think philosophy is necessarily the wrong place to look for comfort.  It's the intellectually masturbatory tendency we have in discussing philosophy that disgusts me, not the ideas themselves.  So, given the thrust of the film seems to be in favor of waking up and taking action, I recommend it.  As the fellow dreamer says, \"Just don't get bored.  This is perhaps one of the most exciting times to be alive.\"  Given that message, along with a marvelous range of artistry in the animation effects, \"Waking Life\" is worth checking out.",

A fair critique would be that the movie didn't take the chance that it was given to educate the viewers in any way about the sophisticated topic of existentialism that the main plot points of the movie seemed to be attempting to surround itself in.However I think what people forget about waking life is that it is less so an exploration of human ideas but more so an exploration of the human mind and specifically the sub conscious of an adolescent.Linklater's goal in this firm wasn't to show growth of a character or try to portray an ideology. Linklater was more so trying to hit the point of the movie by expressing to the audience that the sub conscious is a place that doesn't always coherently go along in a narrative like fashion. Rather it is a place where the bounds of time seem not to exist and flow in a way that seems counter intuitive to the rest of life- he shows this ironically through the incoherence of the film and the dispersed idealogy that stretches and reaches something beyond the dreamer or us as observers . Therefore the movie actually does a great job at what it was trying to explore and invoke in the minds of the audience- the perspective of the protagonist or the boy. If people think that the movie was for their own knowledge they're missing the point of the movie and what is liberating about it, they are missing the lesson. The lesson and part of the movie that is innovative- is the fact that we are an observer of a boy's subconscious who in a lot of ways is also an observer since he's exploring his own sub conscious as well as the ideas of the people who live inside it. In this way the movie is a beautiful symbolic representation of the network of human minds that works together to support that of human ideas and imagination- that of which gives importance to our lives. Therefore the movie touches upon an powerful idea- a idea that we are just merely observers in our own story as much as others. And we like the dreamer are wandering- constantly being effected by external events that don't serve any meaning or purpose necessarily but just show up in our sub conscious and how from there we are forced to make sense of it and pick up the pieces.",

The animation is SO shaky and wavy that I actually felt motion sickness during certain scenes (notably, the scene with the fluctuating biology professor) and had to look away from the screen.  Other scenes work beautifully however, with both understated dialogue and animation style making the message of the film attractive, enjoyable, and occasionally funny.  Sadly, these scenes are in the minority: most of the disjointed scenes consist of 5- to 15-minute onscreen lectures (NOT dialogues or conversations).  These lectures aren't brilliant or especially insightful--they're the kind of stuff that you stayed up until 4 am talking to college roommates about.  Great stuff when you're 18, but pure boredom and naivete when you're a responsible adult.If this movie didn't have the gimmick of being \"animated,\" it would just be another throw-away art house flick made at the level of a college film studies student with an 8 mm camera.

I propose that the theme of this movie is more about birth than death. \"Waking Life\", although based on the extremity of uncertainties, is in my eye, less than guaranteeing the prophecy of the end to our human spirit. It isn't even guessing that you'll die without knowing the grandness of our universe. It is quite simply telling you that you'll always be positive of your soul's origin, everything that will happen to you is a prescription of morality, with decreasing potency as distance increases, until the inevitably and infinitely mysterious unforeseeable end of action. The film, in my opinion, implies that we are witnessing the poetic birth of a soul into the sphere of life.All in all, Linklater has broken the mold of film production. His reminiscent air of nostalgia for the loss of time as golden as spent, does justice to the robbers of the human spirit, as the emotional outlook that captures us all when we look into the eyes of a photo album and feel the burden of a succession of guilt over the advancement of dreams.",

            "content": "\"Waking Life\" works hard to prove that its animation is not a gimmick. For a long time I sat there wondering exactly why they bothered to draw over live footage to create images that, at many times, are just annoying. If they were going to animate it, why not go even farther and alter the images even more? Even backgrounds such as brick walls behind the actors are drawn as they are. Maybe they should have made it half animated, half live. The scene where the four guys, (with Nikki Katt and Adam Goldberg) encounter the old man hanging from the telephone pole would've been more interesting if it were live-action. For a time, I thought that the idea of the animation was to take otherwise boring 'talking head' scenes, of which there are many, and turn them into something more interesting.There's more to it than that, though. The animation has a clear purpose. If the above theory were true, it would be a gimmick. The animation isn't there to signal when we're in a dream. No, the film isn't all a dream. Much of it is real while the film is entirely animated. The film repeatedly touches on the mind's inability to distinguish between dreams and reality. Our minds create our reality for us. What we see is always a matter of interpretation. Dreams are created in our minds when we sleep. The world is merely a stimulus. So actually, there is no 'real' at all. There are as many realities as there are people on the planet.\nSo the premise of \"Waking Life\" is simple: Each person colors their own world differently. Figuratively speaking, we draw over it. Linklater gathers some animators and does this literally, almost as an experiment. Many different artists were given freedom to do whatever they wanted with the live images. They took what they saw in the scene and drew that over it. They interpreted it, the way each of us take physical reality and draw over it in our mind's eye. I didn't always enjoy the experience. There were times when I felt like I was watching \"My Dinner With Andre: the animated version.\" This was a problem near the beginning of the film. As it moves on though, it gets more interesting, as Wiley Wiggins' character's problem becomes clear: He can't wake up from his dream. The film really does make you think. Linklater's point is to explore the importance of dreams and how they reveal the potential of the human mind. Grade: B",

In this we get to hear a bunch of random people talk about their dreams for like 90 minutes, spliced together in the stream-of-consciousness style Linklater used earlier in the movie \"Slacker\".I guess people think this is a brilliant movie because it's so blatant in its attempt to openly discuss contemplative and philosophical ideas. But this movie is not nearly as profound as reading a book that gives a basic overview of academic philosophy.See, the problem here is that the film has no story and has no message. It is only a launchpad for Linklater's self-congratulatory musings on dreams. By throwing this stuff at us so blatantly, the movie loses all of its charm, light-hearted qualities and potential for resonance with the audience's imagination. Maybe one could argue that these are things the movie purposefully eschews, but if so that's because the movie is obnoxiously self-important.Sure, the animation is kind of interesting, but it also becomes really annoying when you realize that it's useless and done only to trick us into thinking the movie has artistic credibility. Frankly, any film that shows Ethan Hawke talking about a dream about his brain's post-mortem functionality is annoying enough. But throw seizure-inducing animation over the scene and a river of vomit ensues.A total Indie-Rock, scenester flick that makes emo-kids pat themselves on the back for watching a movie that thinks about thinking.",

For anyone not aware of the theory taking place, the movie will be nearly incomprehensible. Even with an understanding of the idea, the speed of conversation and the use of a large vocabulary will be obstacles to others. Even the cartoonish presentation may distract during the dialogues, but for others I'd think that even if the ideas are lost, at least they could take pleasure in a truly unique way of movie making. This is especially so given that every scene is animated by a different person, so that the screenscapes change as quickly as the theory under debate. This is a great movie and Linklater sure did his homework. I'll have to go recheck to see if he is the only one credited with writing. Either way a tremendous amount of research went into this. It's all accurate representations of modern theories. Even updates of theories are spoken of like the synthesis of subatomic physics with free will and an existentialist critique of post modernism and new evolution and even some new age rubbish. Great movie and the most intellectually demanding of all time possibly. It'll not be liked by those without a history in the social sciences, or at least art.

            "content": "You can tell a great film by its ability to deflate egos. With a tarnished self-image people will, full of emotion, vigorously attack or praise the work in question. So full of emotion, we can't blame them for leaving reason and justification on the wayside. interpretation, spoilers:Scene one: dream is destiny. Dreams give you your destiny - fate, future, purpose. If dreams can be controlled, then so can your destiny. A lucid dream is a controlled dream. Thus lucidity is the goal sought throughout the entire movie. Scene two: the musicians. Music is a metaphor for the idea of `living in the moment.' This idea is returned to many times throughout the film and is again accentuated in the end when the musicians return.\nScene three: the boat car. The most important part of this scene is the line, `I don't know either (where I'm dropping you off) but it's going to determine the rest of your life.' This is our first brush with determinism. It is not just any determinism, but a radical determinism: even trivial events determine who you are and how you act. This is an unpleasant thought \u0096 especially with regard to the existentialists who make up most of the remainder of the film. Determinism is summarized here and becomes the thesis to which the rest of the film will act as an antithesis towards.\nScene four: the first lecture. The professor is sympathetic to existentialism and disagrees with the post modernists. Essentially, this means that he believes in free will over determinism. Scene five: the evolutionary theorist.Scene six: the free will theorist. This scene gives us our theoretical attempt at destruction of the determinism already built up. However the destruction is far from complete. Instead of arguing for free will, he argues against determinism. A logical fallacy is used here: even if determinism is proven false, we still have no ground for believing that free will is true. The veracity of free will is pretty much assumed here. From this point on, the film attempts to argue for free will by describing it in a wide variety of existential situations. The unifying free will argument employed is this: look at all these situations, look at all the great possibilities \u0096 there's so many that free will must be true. Again, this is not a logically rationalistic argument, it's inductive instead of deductive and hence any conclusions cannot be given certitude. Nevertheless, let's examine the film's possibility-based solutions to determinism.Humans have expanded possibilities in these areas: political freedom (freedom from oppression); lack of barriers and consequent destruction (revenge, self-immolation, murder, nihilism); a collective unconscious (instinct); a collective unconscious (Jungian); a personal unconscious (dreams); creativity (music, art, writing, lucid dreaming); new biology (new evolution and neo-humanity); new technology (the linking of the analogue and digital, the organic with the machine); living in the moment/choosing eternity/the holy moment; immorality (dream time and dreaming from the land of the dead, the illusion of time); interpersonal connection (communication and understanding); submerse yourself in subjectivity; submerse yourself in objectivity; reach the One, the Mind, the subjective objectivity; the need for responsibility (by acting as if we're responsible we're acting as if we have free will); individualism (the need to create our Self); multiple selves (we're too complex and important); life affirmation/the mighty Yes; romanticism (choosing life, passion, the moment again); dreaming itself (anything is possible).    Another is the idea that we can attain freedom by thinking beyond determinism. If our pre-reflective action would have been this, I'll do this! `Super profundito in the early eve of your day.' I.e., with super/extra profundity/knowledge you can outthink determinism. However thinking here simply becomes another determinant and nothing is solved.\nWe also get another pleasant life-affirming view when the computer explains how he'd rather be human. This emotionalism does not give us free will either. The basic idea is that there are such a vast amount of intriguing and spiritual solutions/possibilities, we could never explain everything with a simple naturalistic deterministic theory. The main error in this thinking is the idea that our lack of knowing each determinant disproves determinism.\nNone of the `solutions' to determinism work. Each involves either irrationalism and/or denial. Luckily, the film agrees with this view: the main character in the end loses his lucidity (his freedom) and floats off into the abyssal sky. There is an important point to note however. The point of the film is not to affirm free will, but to examine existential necessity of a free will - or atleast our bad faith in believing in our personal freedom.",

This film wasn't about life, and the philosophies of life, but of finding out that you're dead.  At first, I thought that he died when he got hit in the road when reading the note.  However, I now think that he was dead from the time he got off the plane.  C'mon - the whole thing was unreal from the start: recurring characters (starting with the girl in the airport); bizarre yet unquestioned people, places, or things (the boat-car, etc.); unsteady periphery (stairs melted into one another, hedges danced in the background); and memories intermixed with current thoughts ('Hey, man, what are YOU doing here?').On that basis, I didn't really want the movie to end.

Basically the protagonist, who we quickly learn is dreaming, spends the whole film passively listening to a series of monologues.Some of the monologues touch on philsophical concepts, such as free will versus determinism. But only at a very basic level. So people familiar with the philosophy will gain nothing, while those new to it, will be put off philosophy, I suspect, by this film.Why? Because most of the monologues are never argued coherently. Someone new to philosophy watching this film might think philosophy is not about reasoned argument, it's just about talking quickly enough to sound clever, and never giving anyone a chance to dissect your ideas.The film also feels rather self-indulgent. One of the characters for example, mentions matter-of-factly that there is a bigger difference between Plato and the common man than between the common man and a chimpanzee. The implication being that the filmmakers and maybe others interested in philosophy are better than those who do not. And you can tell that the makers really think this from the tone of the film.There are a number of facts in the film which are incorrect; I wish I had brought a pad to jot them all down, I can remember two off the top of my head: the fact that we regenerate every 7 years and the fact that dreams are not experienced in real-time. So even where the characters bother to give arguments for their worldviews, those arguments are based on false premises.I have given the film 2/10 and that second star is simply for bravery; for attempting to do something original and thought-provoking (but failing).",

If there are, I hope I never meet them. Ever. And I know that anyone who enjoyed this movie is going to say that I \"just didn't get it\", but, I assure you, I got it. And I hated it. Seriously, if I were the main character in this film, I might contemplate ending it all. His dream state involves him wandering around, bumping into random people and listening to their long, drawn-out diatribes about their \"different\" \"philosophies\". I put the word different in quotation marks because the writer of this script obviously was trying really, really hard to achieve that status with the ideas he tried to convey. I put the word philosophies in quotation marks because the arguments of the characters for the most part were weak, extremely left-wing and dripping with pretense. And no one, NO ONE talks the way these characters do. I'm not saying people don't discuss personal philosophies, etc, but if I shut my eyes and listened, I could swear they were just passing around a book by some drugged-out 1960's overly-liberal activist and reading passages aloud. I cannot say how much this movie disappointed me. It could have been great. Even if the message they were trying to convey was still there in another, much subtler form involving, oh, I don't know...a plot. The animation was wonderful and innovative and at first, I thought it would be worth watching just for that. By the end, though, I was so distracted by the preposterous nonsense they were force-feeding me that I was no longer impressed by the visual aspect of the movie. Honestly, if I knew anyone like the writer of this script, I do believe I'd slap them silly. The movie, as a whole, tried so hard to be moving and poignant and thought-provoking that it only ended up making a mockery of itself. Near the end, all I thought about (aside from constantly glancing at the clock to see how soon the movie would end) was which philosopher the next character was going to bastardize and pontificate on for fifteen minutes. It was almost funny when, like clockwork, the character would name drop their philosopher of choice usually within the first sentence out of their mouth. And by \"funny\", I mostly mean \"really, really irritating\", which are exactly the words I'd use to sum up this film.",

Well, picture one of these commercials being FEATURE-LENGTH.  You've got yourself \"Waking Life\".Yes, \"Waking Life\" animation director Bob Sabiston was also responsible for the Earthlink commercials.  While I think the technique has some artistic merit, I think it's best limited to short doses, like commercials or the music video for Zero 7's \"Destiny\" (directed by \"Waking Life\" producer Tommy Pallotta).

However, I've made it my goal for the next few weeks to get as many people as possible to see it.  Whoever funded the film deserves a medal, as it must be one of the least commercial films in living memory.I can't vouch for the faithfulness or otherwise of the rendering of existential theories into what passes for dialogue in the film, but it certainly sounds \"kosher\".  None of the pieces goes on too long - although it does begin with a few doozies, so if you're not completely alienated early on, but are finding it heavy going, DON'T GIVE UP: they get snappier, more varied, and even (on occasion) funnier as the film goes on.Visually, I've never seen anything like it.  I haven't read the other user comments on this site, but I imagine that the animation techniques have already been described, so I won't bother doing that.  What I will say is that I discovered something really extraordinary by accident: I am very short sighted, and NEVER take my glasses off in a film, as I'd see nothing more than a blur.  However, something prompted me to take them off in this film, and I found that when I did that (not all the time, just here and there), I could see more of the \"real\" film underneath the animation - how freaky is that??Another aspect which I can't praise highly enough is the music, most of it composed for the film by one Glover Gill.  It's simply wonderful, and made me want to go out and buy the soundtrack, which is not something I often do.For what it's worth, this is the first film I've given a \"10\" rating to - go and see it with an open mind, and willingness to be surprised, and I'm sure you won't regret it.

            "content": "Waking Life is a cosmic rumination on the nature of time, existence, reality, dream, the meaning and purpose of life, as well as the nature of cinema. Indeed, the animated reality of Richard Linklater's brilliantly conceived film lies somewhere between a dream and reality. It reflects both on life and death and on itself as a film. It continually brings us into to the kind of dream state that watching a movie inherently induces on its audience, a phenomenon that has been commented on by numerous theorists and filmmakers from psychologist Hugo Munsterberg in the 20's to Andre Bazin in the 50's. Waking Life has some wonderful Bazin references. In particular, the story lives in the form of a dream, or possibly the moment of death, of the central character, who is unable awake from his `dream' and return to `reality'. It is a world populated by a series of colorful and reflective characters whose wonderful and lively monologues ruminate on a range of metaphysical and epistemological ideas and possibilities. These cosmic ruminations play as a series of spirited conversations delivered with enthusiasm, conviction and great sincerity by the actors whose physical presence is uniquely transformed into a separate reality. This has the result of allowing the movie to exist verbally and aurally in grounded and far out conversations, while visually it becomes variously more abstracted, more liquid. The film doesn't allow the viewer to connect the actor's \u0091moment' of performance to a corresponding visual reading. The \u0091text' happens on one level while visually, it expresses on a separate level. Of course, this is the basic nature of animation. But here the words and voices are focused on language and the expression of ideas - not action - while the image expresses the actor's emotion in a creatively fluctuating graphic spectacle. At the same time, the nature of this particular animation technique allows for continual echoes of the actor's 'real' performance to come through.  It is a brilliantly conceived interplay of concrete ideas expressed through the use and performance of language, concurrent with an abstracted expressionistic performance of those ideas conceived through the visual art of rotoscope animation. This unique volley between the actor, language, ideas, philosophy, painting and animation has the heightened affect of dream, even of psychedelic or peak experience. It certainly qualifies as 'far out'! Waking Life is a bit like `My Dinner with Andre' meets `Yellow Submarine'. Like its main character we are thrust into a heightened world of image and idea, which is the best that dreaming and reality, not to mention cinema, has to offer.",

A lessor director would have played favorites and mocked certain ideas. Not Richard all the views in the film inhabit their space in the film. Attacking ideas by grasping onto the opposite idea is a trap of the mind, a trick that allows the ego to regain control over you, and it is one thing that Richard never indulges in. It is conflicting ideas that divide us in camps that cause conflict. Showing these divisions at their most absurd cannot help but demand the viewer ask themselves what is the unifying force?A lot of people find the film pretentious and yes a lot of the ideas in the film are pretentious and overwrought but that doesn't make the film these things. A lot of people get hung up in the ideas in the film. But they're clearly and literally all cartoons. The film lays down the hammer on itself late in the game, telling the viewer to just snap out of it, wake up and embrace life. The whole thing, put the divisions aside and suck on the marrow of life.

For instance, Many of the characters describe in one way or another describe what the film is (the author, the not-an-ant character's soap opera, etc). In a respect, the director is even criticizing himself (\"its sort of a dream within a dream\" \\ \"you just lost two million dollars\"). Granted, much of the material discussed is sort of \"pop\" philosophy or spirtiuality. Nonetheless its interesting ideas, or at least interesting portrayals of old ideas. The animation is the source of a lot of criticism. Honestly I don't believe it would have held up if it were not rotoscoped. Many of the scenes would have almost no motion without. With it, the movie takes on another dimension of dreamlike surreality. It sort of breathes life into what could otherwise be just as interesting as an audio tape. The music, again, is fantastic, despite it being completely outside my normal tastes.

I'm saddened by many of the positive comments I've seen so far about this movie. The film, first of all, is a quasi re-hash of \"Slacker\", one of Linklater's first films. 90+ minutes of people wandering around vomiting the philosophical appetizers Linklater was able to jam in one script. Linklater has this funny way of tempting you with what appears to be very deep and \"outside the box\" thinking but very little of the story is really any of his own original material. Most of the script takes ideas from established philosophers and spits them right back at you. In fact, in Slacker there is a scene where a female character accuses her male friend of that very same thing. She claims he pulls bits and pieces from the books he has read and mish-mashes them together in what sounds like his own original thoughts. In reality, he (the character) is nothing more than the sh*t he reads and uses it to boost his ego by condescending to other people. He has nothing *real* inside. The Slacker redone feeling is reinforced when you start recognizing actors from Slacker in Waking Life PLAYING THE SAME CHARACTERS THEY PLAYED IN SLACKER! This movie does for people the same thing that bands like Rage Against the Machine does. Both give the consumer the false notion that just being aware of an issue makes him or her qualified to address the issue. Tell you what, I'm going to compose the greatest philosophical work EVER by cutting the most poignant, yet out of context page, from every book written by every philosopher whom ever lived. I'll even include the Bible, Koran and the most important Zen koan collection to date. I will then have created an existential work that does a great job of touching the surface of existence and leaves the reader with all sorts of passages and ideas to quote but utterly fails at providing any substance. Be wary of anyone who tells you this is a brilliant film. It is a clever film, but not brilliant.",

I love Linklater's method of stream-of-consciousness film-making where the camera seems to just wander around aimlessly following characters who are once mundane and interesting. Slackers was one of Linklater's first movies and it seems that he has made a followup with a twist. Following characters in a dream state to reality brings up many of the philosophical questions that we all should be asking about the nature of our minds. Linklater is at his best when he makes these \"internal\" films that question reality and how us humans fit into it. I can't wait for the next one that deals with important issues and ideas (maybe instead of Bad News Bears).",

            "content": "This is not really a review, but includes some underlying themes and subtexts that I noticed.  It does go a bit into plot; therefore spoilers might be construed to be in some of my comments.I saw this theatrically opening night in Chicago, twice more theatrically, and another 4 times on DVD. I am of the opinion that after Wiley gets hit by the car, the entire rest of the film is his struggles with the \"spirit realm\" and crossing over to death. This can be seen in many parts of the film, but especially at the end in the discussion about death over a game of pinball. I believe that his attempt to grasp the car handle and subsequent miss was his attempt to grasp onto some specific memories from his childhood, but finally understanding, and letting go to join with whatever it is that's out there. Also, when the word \"dreaming\" is used, I think the words \"astral projection\" can easily be applied instead. I think the entire film is a demonstration of travelling out of body, and makes the case that it is an ability that is inherent in everyone, but we just need the right circumstances and mindset to bring out this latent ability. Using \"dreams\" though is a bit safer, and not quite so abstract and \"occult\" or \"paranormal.\" I especially like the discussion about how we are constantly saying no to God's invitation, that we are not ready yet, but that in the end (death), we all have to accept his invitation. After he got hit, and after the conversations about how we communicate with each other, with \"dead words\" and that something essential has been lost in our ways of communicating with each other, the first words that Wiley speaks (after about 15-20 minutes, maybe more) are into a telephone, a highly depersonalized and cold and sterile form of conversation. Just coincidence? I think not. I also like the continuation of the theme elaborated on in the very beginning of Linklater's Slacker about \"alternate futures\" (also the major theme of Lola Rennt). Waking Life has Wiley riding a train, then sees a girl, but instead of choosing to talk to her, he boards the \"boat car.\" Slacker did this as well, but Linklater boarded a taxi, and explains how if he had stayed in the station, he might have met some girl, and moved in together, etc...and that you can somehow puncture through this reality into that one, and get a glimpse of something that might have been, because this alternate future is still running parallel to your own timeline. Personally, I call that deja vu. In any case, when Wiley meets the girl again later, he \"wakes up\" from his dream, and looks anguished and throws his face into his hands. I read this as his realization that his ultimate fate (getting hit by the car) could ultimately have been different had he only talked to the girl. Possibly, they could have moved in together.... A few more points I want to discuss...first, Delpy and Hawke being in the film brought a HUGE smile to my face, as Before Sunrise (along with Waking Life and SLacker) is in my top 15 of all time, with Before Sunrise being rated the highest of the three, but just barely. I actually clapped at the theater when they began (continued) the discussion of souls, and where all the new souls came from. This was one of my favorite discussions from Before Sunrise, but I think the way it is explained in Waking Life is a bit confusing, and Before Sunrise does a bit better job at it. It was also good to see that they got back together after their \"let's meet in one year at this train terminal\" at the end of Before Sunrise. I've never seen Dazed and Confused, so I cannot comment on that film. I read somewhere that at the Sundance premiere, Linklater, prior to the screening, asked if anyone in the audience was currently under the influence of drugs. A few people raised their hands, and Linklater told them that they would have to get together at the end of the screening and explain the film to everyone else. This film, even with all its technical brilliance and intelligence, did drag a bit in the final half hour, and I would therefore rate it at a 9 out of 10.",

The movie can penetrate the routines of acceptance a person builds up philosophically to answer the unanswerable questions of life and existence, however the viewer has to be willing to let the movie penetrate their defenses.  Watching this movie while in a sober state isn't going to do much for you.  This film is certainly enhanced by the viewer's use of drugs, or the drugs weakening the viewer's inner defenses to the messages and meanings in this film. \tI found myself paying less and less attention to the `animated' images on screen, listening instead to the words behind it and concentrating/meditating on items of interest in the apartment I viewed the film.  The film's contents is some of the deepest I have ever encountered.  I'll give a spoiler alert to be safe, but I don't feel this movie can be spoiled as everyone will take their own unique messages from this film.  The film itself deals with lucid dreaming, but I started applying these theories to every day life.  Can we prove we are human, or better yet more than human? How would we answer someone on the outside looking in who asked us if humans were lazy or fearful?  What if our friends and acquaintances were only characters in a dream?  Is the face of god your own face?  Will those who steal our lives steal our dreams as well?  Does god dream of being Satan, and Does Satan dream of being god?  Did prehistoric Fish ever dream one day they would evolve into humans?  What If you're still that fish and your reality is nothing more than a dream? \tThis film is deep to an insane degree, and you won't enjoy it in a sober state.  Ok so it's a drug movie, but it is an outstanding, mind-blowing, through provoking drug movie.  I give it 6 Qs and 4 Zebras out of 9 Stars",

            "content": "I saw this film at the London Film Festival and was greatly impressed.  It's main attraction is, obviously, the original visual style employed by Linklater, and his team of artists.  The method of painting over the film is visually stunning, and as part of his audience, Linklater does literally catapult you into the genuinely trippy world of the human mind.  The artistic freedom given to the film makers by their technique is almost unlimited, and they do exploit it to their advantage.  Characters morphing into their ideas and theories, and other little bits of animation away from the main action, do show great attention to detail, but sometimes it does seem as though the animation is distracting you from the dialogue, and it can be frustrating as many of the theories discussed by the characters are confusing and require concentration.  Whether this is deliberate is debatable, Linklater may be trying to confuse the audience into thinking that he is a genius.However, away from the visuals, this is an accomplished feat of movie making.  Despite the fact that there is a complete lack of character building, aside from Wiley Wiggins, our tour guide figure, the film is thought provoking, and allows the audiences imagination to fill in the deliberate gaps left.  Personally, I enjoy this a lot better than being told precisely what is going on and precisely what to feel by the film.  Much of the dialogue is intelligent, and avoids many clich\u00e9s which I was afraid would be the death of the film.  The script expertly moulds philosophy, drama and comedy together into what would be described as a \u0091whirlwind world' if it wasn't slow moving, allowing the audience to gather their thoughts together before being assaulted by another ideology.It may be that much of this film is confusing because Linklater is deliberately trying to confuse you, attempting to convey the confused state which many of his characters seemed to be in with their jumbled ideologies. Whatever the reason, this film could well have been a masterpiece, but maybe just falls close to the mark.9/10",

Perhaps this is interesting to someone who likes to study various philosophical ideas, but as entertainment it does not work, and I certainly find it ludicrous that people's lives improved because of this movie. A philosophy is only as good as one can apply to their life. Can anyone out there really say, \"Wow, after seeing 'Waking Life' my relationship with my wife improved!\". Or, \" Something I saw in 'Waking Life' helped me to communicate better with people.\"I will say that the animation work is impressive in this film. It certainly gave the film the \"dream state\" quality the director was looking for. And, again, would be especially be appreciated by those under the influence of mind altering chemicals. Richard Linklater has certainly done better work than this. 4/10.",

It is simply distracting. The dialogue commits the worst sin of making a self conscious effort to be seen as an intelligent and savy commentary on life and to be seen to be dealing with some otherwise untouched and profound issues. I cringed from the beginning. The overly articulated language hides a series of very ordinary or even pompous viewpoints which at times are delivered at a annoyingly rapid rate. The screen writer/film maker in my opinion was too concerned with giving the impression of art and intellectual depth and originality but it is schoolboy stuff really. This flick is a near empty vessel with any slightly insightful messages contained within it being disregarded totally by me due to my aversion for smug philosophizing. The final product unfortunately comes across as a pretentious movie and I advise others to steer clear if you have an ounce of smarts.",

            "content": "FIRST IMPRESSIONSAs soon as I saw the first screenshots of the animated film \"Waking Life,\" I knew right then and there that I had to see this movie.  And now, two years after it was first released, I can honestly say I shouldnt have waited so long.  This film is a masterpiece, plain and simple.  One of the best movies of the year.\nSUMMARYA young man is thrusted into one dream after another, having conversations with a whole group of young theorists explaining topics such as dreams and reincarnation.  This film was first shot using a digital camera, and then a sort of wavy animation was laced over the footage, creating the inconsistent look of a dream.\nACTING: 95%The acting done throughout this film is excellent.  Excellent mainly because it seems so realistic.  Whenever the actors engage in a conversation, you feel like you're just listening in on some neighbors' chatter.  Perhaps, a little overacting in one scene, I wont specify.  But, besides that, realistic acting all around, and realistic acting is, as we all know, the most simple type of acting, but is also the hardest to present.\nSTORY: 100%Everytime the main character engages in a conversation with someone, that someone always has something interesting to say.  ALWAYS.  The stories never bore you, never bring your attention level down, and make you think for hours and hours after viewing the movie.  But, thats where a problem could lie; I say could, because it may not happen to everyone.  If you want to watch this movie, you have devert all your attention to it.  You cant like wash some dishes or fold the laundry while watching; you just cant.  The key to this movie is the diologue.  The key to making this movie WORK and FUNCTION is the conversations.  So, if you listen up, you'll be in for a ride you'll never forget.\nDIRECTION: 95%As you know, its an animation.  Its got all the usual elements of a traditional cartoon.  But the camera angles and shots still appear to be movie-like.  Well, thats because it was originally shot thorugh a video camera.  This technique definetely make this movie much more enjoyable.\nMEANING: 100%I'll let you perceive this movie your own way.  Because, truthfully, I've only seen this movie once so far, and I understand about half of what the characters are talking about.  So, this is a movie that you must see at least two times.\nFUN FACTOR: 90%Perhaps its weakest point, \"Waking Life\" is not the most exciting movie to watch.  But, it certainly is entertaining.  If you really get into the movie, you'll be thinking you're living in a dream right now.  A topic I always asks myself was: \"If Waking Life was just left as a regular movie and no animation was added, would it be as good?\"\nFINAL IMPRESSION: ---96%One of the best movies of the year, hands down.  There is simply no movie like it anywhere.  If you're interested in understanding and controling your dreams, this movie is certainly worth a trip.  In fact, if you are one of those \"dreamers,\" I'm ordering you to watch this movie.  You wont be disappointed.",

            "content": "Waking Life is a daring, insightful and visionary effort by one of the finest directors around Richard Linklater. Linklater through his filmography has shown a fascination for conversations, for opinions and he sets a fairly high benchmark for his characters in that regard. Waking life is simply the concoction of different conversation, different view points of people from different strands of life and their take on meaning of life and purpose of life as they see it.Why are we here? What is it that makes us human? Is this a reality or a dream? Questions that Linklater has pondered over through his filmography. As one of the reviews put it, it is a film for passionate thinkers. It can come of as pretentious for some, but for me the movie struck all the right chords. It was released few weeks after 9/11 when there was a sense of disorientation with world for me. This movie was exactly what I needed just to put things into perspective.What is the story? As one of the character says, \"there is no story just people, gesture, moments, bits of rapture, fleet of emotions. In short, the greatest stories ever told\". The protagonist floats and flies from one dream to the next, from one conversation to the next. Ther is no coherent screenplay, just ideas bouncing off the characters in an urge to find new meanings to our existence and purpose. The protagonist clearly is an intelligent person as can be assessed from the grade of the discussions in his dreams. \"Life understood is life lived\".Waking Life is philosophical and playful at the same time. It's an extravagantly inventive film that begins with actual footage of real actors and then translates them into animated images; it's called motion-capture, and you can see it in \"Beowulf\" and \"300,\" but it was startling when Linklater made his film in 2001, and showed it didn't need to cost millions. A founding member of the Austin, Texas, film-making crowd, he collaborated with a software genius named Bob Sabiston, who did it all on Macs. It's visually bright and alive -- a joy to regard. The animated nature of the film also gives Linklater the license and technique to create a dream like quality to the film, of course it looks absolutely stunning.It is a film that requires patience from its audience, but also need them to submit. Here are few monologues or conversation from the movie that got through to me:-\"Boat Car Guy: I feel like my transport should be an extension of my personality. And this is like my little window to the world... and every minute's a different show. I may not understand it. I may not even necessarily agree with it. But I'll tell you what I've accepted: just sort of glide along. You want to keep things on an even key, this is what I'm saying. You want to go with the flow. The sea refuses no river. The idea is to remain in a state of constant departure while always arriving. It saves on introductions and goodbyes. The ride does not require explanation - just occupancy. That's where you guys come in. It's like you come onto this planet with a crayon box. Now you may get the 8 pack, you may get the 16 pack but it's all in what you do with the crayons - the colors - that you're given. Don't worry about coloring within the lines or coloring outside the lines - I say color outside the lines, you know what I mean? Color all over the page; don't box me in! We're in motion to the ocean. We are not land locked, I'll tell you that.\"\"Guy Forsyth: The trick is to combine your waking rational abilities with the infinite possibilities of your dreams. Because, if you can do that, you can do anything\"\"Guy Forsyth: The worst mistake that you can make is to think you're alive when really you're asleep in life's waiting room\"\"Soap Opera Woman: Excuse me. Wiley: Excuse me. Soap Opera Woman: Hey. Could we do that again? I know we haven't met, but I don't want to be an ant. You know? I mean, it's like we go through life with our antennas bouncing off one another, continuously on ant autopilot, with nothing really human required of us. Stop. Go. Walk here. Drive there. All action basically for survival. All communication simply to keep this ant colony buzzing along in an efficient, polite manner. \"Here's your change.\" \"Paper or plastic?' \"Credit or debit?\" \"You want ketchup with that?\" I don't want a straw. I want real human moments. I want to see you. I want you to see me. I don't want to give that up. I don't want to be ant, you know?\"\"Guy Forsyth: Did you ever have a job that you hated and worked real hard at? A long, hard day of work. Finally you get to go home, get in bed, close your eyes and immediately you wake up and realize... that the whole day at work had been a dream. It's bad enough that you sell your waking life for minimum wage, but now they get your dreams for free\"\"Boat Car Guy: The idea is to remain in a state of constant departure while always arriving\"",

And she's laying down on her side with her arm under her head like a pillow. And her shirt is lifted up over her belly--Well, she's pregnant--like seven months pregnant--And her huge belly--beautiful--is sticking out. And I think then of the kid--you know, the fetus inside there--It's alive--but I don't know what it looks like. I don't know who it is. And it's fascinating suddenly. But the movie's still going. So I turn back to it. But then I'm listening to the movie and my eyes are watching--they're sort of recording the movement--the action--but it doesn't make any sense to me--I mean, it doesn't mean anything to me--because I'm not in it...And then I look back at my wife and I see her belly move--I mean, the baby inside her is kicking her in the ribs--And she moans, Ah--and I can see its little feet push against her skin--like it wants to get out--or at least its getting bigger and it can't stay in there forever. And so I'm fascinated again. And I grab the remote--because I can't do both--and I push pause in the movie--it's digital now, so, like, it could stay that way forever--or until I ran out of power, electricity, or something--Wiley Wiggins: \"Yeah. I hear you.\" My Character: \"Yeah. So I see this kid kicking my wife and she's moaning and I'm sitting there on the couch touching her leg and watching her. And it's getting late you know. But I start to think--about this kid and how he doesn't have an identity yet--he hasn't been born. He could be anybody you know? I mean, he comes out and sees us and he's like attached to us, instinctively--And he needs to be fed and he needs to be kept clean and healthy--He needs us to survive.Wiley Wiggins: (jokingly) \"He needs you to wipe his ass.\" My Character:(laughing) \"Yeah! Exactly. And he doesn't know who we are, except maybe in some mysterious genetic way--But it's sort of coded in a language we don't quite understand--at least, we can't really use our code--our language--to make it understood-- Wiley Wiggins: (skeptical look) \"Are you talking about cloning or something?\" My Character: \"No! Hell no! No. I'm talking about my kid--that I made--with my wife--in our bed. And he's not dead, but he's not quite alive yet--and so--who is he? I mean, what is that like? To be alive in that moment, those nine months in the womb before you're born.\"Wiley Wiggins: (after long pause) \"I don't know, man. I mean, I forget.\"My Character: \"No. I don't--that wasn't a question really--not for you--I mean it's just a question.\"Wiley Wiggins: (another pause) \"Well, did you tell your wife about it--I mean did you ask her-- My Character: \"No--Well, she was asleep. (pause) But then I woke her up--after I finished watching the movie--and I told her it was time to go to bed. And then we were laying there--I mean, she groaned when she got up--she didn't want to get up--I offered to just give her a blanket or something--but she got up--so we could sleep together--I mean next to each other. And so I was rubbing her back--we were laying there--she was pretty wiped out--and I started thinking--I started writing something down, but I was laying there in bed still--\" Wiley Wiggins: \"--rubbing your wife's back.\" My Character: \"Right. And I suddenly had to get up. I had to write this down--actually write it down--on paper--not just in my head still lying there in my bed--I was comfortable--but I had to get up...And then I went to the kitchen and turned on the light above the stove. It was soft. It was dim. It was late. I didn't want to wake anybody--I mean, I was totally naked too--I didn't bother to get dressed. And I went out into the kitchen and I found a notebook and I grabbed a pen and starting writing--finally--something. And it came pouring out of me--it was nice--But I heard my wife get up and I heard her walking towards me in the dark--And I say to her--before she can say anything--before she can ask me anything--I say to her\" (looks at Wiley Wiggins, intently): \"I'm writing.\"",

Not since my college days sitting at the knees of professors or fellow students discussing great ideas has anything jump-started me into the present so quickly and inspired my mind.  I'm grateful for such films as this.  So few address us as readers and thinkers.  I know there is depth out there in human kind, but lately the glut and adoration of trashiness and commonality has been too much.  Bravo to a courageous film and filmmaker who took a leap!  For those who said they didn't 'get it', I'm truly sorry as they must never take a look at life and being and ask questions.  I think the animation served wonderfully to neutralize the viewer and mezmerize at the same time without the distraction of real life which would have interfered more with the transmission of these great journeys of the human mind!",

Not only the plot(Or lack of it thereof) refuses to follow a conventional structure or \"logic\" (Except, of course, \"the logic\" of the dreams) but also the strange, deranged visual style of this film made us think about those worlds inside our minds, the world of dreams and imagination. \"Waking Life\" makes a quite interesting portrayal of those worlds, focusing in the unpredictable nature of it, showing as well, the parallels existent between dreams and reality: It might look like something real but it isn't. The viewer can either agrees or not with many of the thoughts expressed in this film, but the way in which those thoughts are expressed is magnificent, giving us a lot of perspectives, lot of different views of life, death, reality and many other themes, but without forcing the viewer to accept one as the \"True\" and definitive one. And is that quality that made me love this film even more, and consider it a unique, and unrepeatable film experience.",

So after hearing a lot of great reviews of this film, I could hardly wait to see it.  I was very disappointed.\"Waking Life\" is essentially not a film at all, but a series of lectures in philosophy.  Since the time of Christ, the best teachers have understood that the most interesting way to teach a lesson is through a story. Filmmakers have the greatest medium in history available to tell their story.  They can use music, actors, writers, costumes, plot, and dozens of other tricks to get the audience interested in their film.  To waste a great story-telling medium like film to present a seminar in philosophy is foolish.  The greatest films of all time contain quite a bit of philosophy, but you need to discover the message for yourself.  The message isn't rammed down your throat as a lecture.  The #1 film on the IMDB, \"The Godfather\", is nothing more than a parable about the importance of family and loyalty. \nDiscovering the message for yourself is much more satisfying than having a series of teachers tell you what the message is.  In fact, the only times when \"Waking Life\" was interesting is when some of the characters told a story to discuss their world-view of philosophy.  Linklater is capable of making a great film with a hidden message.  In fact, his film \"Dazed and Confused\" is all about having fun within a confining environment.  It's essentially \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" set at a high school instead of at an insane asylum.  I hope that Linklater's next film is along those lines.  Here, I think Linklater just went back and re-made \"Slacker\", using animation and actors to explain different theories of philosophy in more depth than in \"Slacker.\"  The bottom line is that it was tough sitting through the whole two hours of this film without falling asleep.",

In both cases, the result is utterly pointless and a total waste of time (apart, of course, from the above-mentioned stunning visual experience) - it's not just a series of dialogues, it's a REALLY LONG series of dialogues with (if you dig just a little) no real substance whatsoever. Considering that, and particularly in the second option above, it is tempting to bundle the (lack of) contents with the form as one of the most pretentious attempts at \"artsy\" cinema recently made. By the way, for an interesting criticism of the kind of vacuous discourse (part of) the script is made of, I recommend \"Fashionable Nonsense : Postmodern Intellectuals' Abuse of Science\".",

What more can be said about a movie that diverts your attention from your pocketful of contraband melted Raisinets?Not only was this film pretentious and boring, it borrowed shamelessly and endlessly and inaccurately from second-rate hack philosophers, without even giving them appropriate credit.  Where were the explosions and intrigue and psychodrama that had been promised in the movie's trailer?Nor is it original:  I saw the same film three years ago starring Robin Williams.  But aside from the above observations, I must give Mr. Linklater kudos for apparently hiring the entire TCM animation team, as well as prominently advertising IFC's participation in his dubious venture, as well as his inclusion of a puzzling endorsement from the much-lauded Steven Soderburgh, who inexplicably appears in a thankfully (if inartfully) quasi-animated cameo.That said, as an on-again, off-again former high school cheerleader who was once featured on the inset of the Butler Middle School weekly gazette, and twice made love in the back seat of an Audi, I have little doubt that certain less discerning critics will oooh and aaah over this poisonous piece of pretentious excrement.If you liked Powder or Sommersby, you'll love Waking Life.

At times while you're watching it, you wish a particular character would shut the hell up, but you're not really antsy, because you know someone else will come along in a minute or two, and maybe you'll find them interesting, and maybe they'll be gone before you've had enough. I usually mistrust films that beg to be seen again, movies that as soon as they're over you need to watch them from the beginning in order to actually understand them. But Waking Life makes you want to watch it again because it's such an intelligent, heady mix of ideas that you want to hear them again, to mull over the best ones and reconsider the worst ones. The movie is both elitist and populist; actually, it's neither, it just stands those terms on their heads and makes them irrelevant. You have a bunch of people talking about deep philosophical topics, and some of the people are among the elite of their field and some are just average Joes or Janes, and some of them are on target and some are full of bull, but there's no direct correlation between a character's standing in their field and their level of bull. Some of the sharpest characters are Joe/Jane Average; some of the most overblown are \"professionals.\" And some pros are sharp, and some Joe-Janes are loony. Categories are worthless in this film.As for the look of the film, it is one of the best visual approximations I've ever seen of tripping ... OK, of dream states. The world under the influence of LSD looks and feels a lot like the imagery in the movie. It gets that \"weirder than real yet somehow more real than real\" feeling down perfectly.This is a very smart movie that has the potential for broad appeal. That's a good thing.

What passes for entertainment these days is sad, and not even entertainment if the definition in the dictionary holds up. It's all disheartening and sad.  I found no film this year more depressing than \"Pearl Harbor,\" and wasn't that supposed to be our big popcorn movie for the year?  Why was it there?  Why was I there?  What purpose did it serve?  If anything can be said about \"Waking Life,\" it has reasons for being there. I won't get into the story because there really isn't one.  It just floats from person to person, conversation to conversation, in a slow and leisurely pace.  But the conversations are of the like that we should see more of. About the inner-workings of dreams, the philosophy behind reincarnation, how the standard rules of etiquette between strangers keeps us from ever really connecting with most people.  To me at least, that's a hell of a lot more interesting than how the damn Bears did on Sunday.Richard Linklater shot this film on a digital camcorder and gave it to internet artist Bob Sabiston to draw over.  The result is an animated film of the likes which we have never seen and probably won't see again.  The nuances of human behavior are caught in a fluid manner.  The result is really quite spectacular.Some might chalk this film up to amateurish philosophizing.  But isn't it nice that a film is made just to philosophize at all?  This movie is filling and you will walk out asking questions about yourself and the universe around you.  \"Waking Life\" is art at its peak.But, alas, I fear the worst.

If Linklater had decided to film \"Waking Life\" straight, he would have had a darn good art film that poses all the big questions of the universe. But he decided to go one step further. He employed a team of animators, using a computer program, who animate in rotoscopic fashion on top of each frame. The effect is different than animation and different than film. He shot the initial footage with a hand held video camera. The result is a frame that is constantly shaking a little. This, along with the animation, creates a sensation that things are constantly shifting and changing and pulsing with life. Because the film process used real actors to inspire the animation, you get the subtle expressions and moments of life that can't be faked by animators\u0097the movement of a cheek, the swatting of a fly, the double take. This technique has been used since then with \"Lord of the Rings\" and is becoming a standard technique as seen in \"Beowulf.\" But at the time, in 2001, this was groundbreaking. Another fun attribute of the animation is the license to experiment that the animators are given. They add little embellishments, like animating in the air the objects that are being discussed. At one point, while discussing clouds, the characters turn into clouds. Additionally, the animators constantly change animation styles to fit the moods and subjects of the scene. This creates an experience that is always viscerally interesting and surprising at each new turn. On a substance level, the movie starts out completely random, to the point where you don't really think there's an actual story going on. But at a certain point, you realize that there is a plot\u0097the main character is caught in a series of dreams and he's trying to wake up. This creates a narrative hook that pushes us through the end.All said and done, no movie is as artificial and as alive as \"Waking Life.\" This is, of course, a metaphoric illustration of the movie's point. Watching \"Waking Life\" for the first time was like experiencing a new and very powerful type of art form that had never existed before. Because of this, I can't just mildly suggest this film. It isn't just a great movie or even a unique movie. It's an experience that is unlike anything I've ever had. This is a film one absolutely, without excuse, must see.

He travels through a dreamlike world talking with and learning from a whole series of characters. Some of the discussions are very hard to follow, but they all require you to THINK.The animation is another beautiful part. A whole series of artists animated this film and each shot of the movie could be a work of art in its own right.Folks, this isn't a munch on popcorn, escapist date movie. This is an innovative, mesmerizing, thoughtful journey. It's not for everyone. It's not supposed to be. Just look at most Hollywood movies and you'll see why people are uneasy about a movie that strays so much from the boring, empty, shallow, star-studded films that most directors make.",

What are they trying to tell him? Why can't he wake up?  If you're the kind of person who enjoys long and rambling philosophical conversations, you'll probably enjoy Waking Life.

There were some dream speeches that were very insightful that I could, surprisingly enough, relate to.  There are also some wickedly funny scenes and one-liners.  I saw the film with someone who complained that it had all been done before in Woody Allen movies, with the intelligent dialogue, but this film is worth seeing simply for the look of it.

            "content": "The first thing, perhaps, that needs to be said about \"Waking Life\" is that it will almost certainly not be everyone's proverbial cup of tea. For a number of reasons. Firstly, we live in a world where art-house cinema invariably gets described by the average move-goer as \"pretentious\". Secondly, Richard Linklater isn't ashamed to be high-brow. The ideas may not be new (he tends to do a bit of a \"Sophie's World\" with twentieth-century intellectualism, summarising rather than expounding), but they are certainly highly cerebral. Thus, the demographic of \"Waking Life\" is immediately reduced predominantly to Arts, Philosophy or Science students who have the time and interest to give it the thought it requires. Thirdly, it has a drastically limited release, especially in Australia, so viewers need to be quite serious about seeking it out before they can watch it.Yet all that this means is that Richard Linklater will not win an Oscar, much as he may deserve one (the Academy probably haven't even heard of him) and he will not break box-office records. But does any of this matter? \"Waking Life\" is a cinematic milestone, as well as being one of few films to be nothing but art. The initial digital-camera filming allows for creativity of expression, as well as fine acting performances, that mere animation does not achieve - the characters feel like real people, some of the highlights being character roles such as the eccentric scientist sharing his views on evolution with Wiley Wiggins, as well as the too short in-bed philosophy session with Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy. The range of characters makes \"Waking Life\" feel like a true journey through the collective human consciousness, from beatnik mandolin players doing spoken-word analyses of the human condition to existential philosophy lecturers. The people are alive and vibrant, with the amazingly creative animation often bringing this out, such as the evolutionist who seems to be bursting with eccentric intellectual fervour. The artwork that constitutes the animation makes it a film of immense beauty, and achieves a sophistication that proves animation is not restricted to kid-flicks.\"Waking Life\" is not an easy film. It requires thought - very deep thought. Yet the result is perhaps the most emotionally and intellectually rewarding film I have ever experienced. It is pure art, and a work of rare genius. Do not mistake its unashamed intellectualism for pretense - it does not claim to be \"Human Consciousness for Beginners\". Open yourself up to Linklater's trip through the human psyche and be rewarded - you may not experience something like it ever again. (10/10)",

The monologues about love and the meaning of love have probably already been heard or spoken by any college student who ever stayed up to the wee hours talking with his or her roommates and friends. If you ever stayed up late smoking pot or drinking and talking with friends, then you've probably had these same conversations.",

The plot is thin, but it doesn't make this film less intriguing.

Some of it is done by characters who are arrogant mental masturbaters. Some of it is done by people who seem to genuinely be exploring questions about the nature of reality, the purpose of life, etc. I think this is intentional. The film maker has a perspective here, and it is discernible, even through the incredible maze of personalities and ideas that we encounter with Wiley.On the surface, there is one overarching question being explored by the main character, Wiley: he is trying to determine whether or not he is dreaming, and whether or not this matters. A basic epistemological issue. En route, however, many other issues are raised. Even though the film is episodic in nature (the scenes are distinct from each other, lacking in temporal continuity), the audience becomes aware that there are meaningful underlying connections between seemingly distinct arenas of philosophical exploration: metaphysics, ethics, human nature and identity formation, epistemology, etc.I show this film in my classes in a number of different contexts. In my Rhetoric classes, we discuss the medium of episodic story-telling in film. In my Philosophy classes, we compare the different concepts about ultimate reality that are advocated by the different characters. In my Eastern Religions classes, we discuss notions of self that are brought out.I think this is a film that has to be seen several times in order to pick up on everything going on--even just visually. The animation is expressive and exciting: visually communicating with the audience about the concepts being discussed simultaneously in the dialogue. In my opinion, this is a very tight production.",

I think the critics and others are afraid to critique this movie because they might be seen as \"not getting it.\" There were moments onscreen that were truly brilliant, and the humor was subtle and quite effective at times. The rest of the movie seemed to be Linklater writing with the \"Johns-Hopkins guide to Literary Criticism\" in his lap.

After an intriguing start, we are presented with a a series of such philosophers, some of whom sometimes have something interesting to say - but most of whom produce the type of undergraduate philosophical platitudes.Both the beginning and the end of the film are interesting, in a  Phillip K Dick kind of way. As the protagonist begins to wonder whether he is trapped in a lucid dream, the film almost makes an effort to develop a plot.\nIn summary - just because someone is animated, it doesn't mean they are right, or indeed interesting.Do yourself a favour, buy yourself books By Hofstadter, Russell and Dick and get your philosophy first hand. Then go and watch Monsters Inc.Oh - too harsh - the animation was marvelous. But animation is not enough.",

At first Waking Life plays like an animated version of Slacker, only more pretentious and less ironic, which is not an advantage; the philosophical points made by the various characters are much less profound than the characters think. (The banal flattening of existentialism by the over-prolific Robert Solomon is one of the most egregious examples.)But Linklater has the film firmly in command. He gives his daughter the opening line, kicks off the action in his own person, reappears at the end to sum it up with a pointed reference to Philip K. Dick, and right in the middle stages an ironic autocritique of the whole project. And as the slow parade of faces and voices passes, the amorphous Wiley Wiggins begins to play a part in the story, and his struggle to comprehend what is happening to him is increasingly poignant and chilling.To say more would require a spoiler warning. But this is not a film where anything can be taken at face value, and to write it off as a plotless philosophy symposium would be to miss out on a remarkably subtle and moving achievement.\nAnd the music--played by the Tosca Tango Orchestra--is first rate.",

First, it's one of those rare films that is mostly conversation and almost no action.  So, right away that eliminates the interest of at least 80% of the American moviegoing audience.  Second, the animation is very unusual.  This film was based on live action filmed by Richard Linklater, and that becomes clear right away as you see how the characters move and act like live actors.  The live action film is then animated via a technique called rotoscoping.  In addition, the animation is not attempting to recreate reality, but rather emphasizes the emotions and mannerisms of the characters in a surreal but beautiful manner.  Lastly, the subject matter is like all those deep conversations you would get into at a coffee shop, or sitting with your friends late at night having a few drinks.  People talk about philosophy, religion, relationships, and even the meaning of life.  It's a very thought provoking and intellectually stimulating film.You know how every once in a while you read a book or play and say, \"this book changed my life!\"  For a lot of people that might be The Catcher in the Rye, To Kill a Mockingbird, etc.  I'm not implying that Waking Life equals reading great literature, but that's the kind of high I was on when I walked out of the theatre.This film is not for everyone.  Some of you will think it's ugly animation or say it's boring.  But that's not what I see.  If you're not afraid of a prod toward introspection, you must see this film.Put another way, I believe the value you find in this film reflects the value you find in yourself.

My acceptance as to whether a film taxes my brain depends solely on whether the ideas deserve it.

Waking Life requires an interest in philosophy, at least at some level, to mean anything to the viewer. What I'm suggesting is this: the target audience of freethinkers will find nothing new to mull over here, because there isn't anything, it's just more of the same-old-same-old. Even if you watch an average amount of TV you will come across everything, and most of the ideas are only slight variations of others.Having said that, these thoughts being brought into one arena and fired at the audience in quick succession is quite refreshing, even if they won't learn anything new. Also, someone could learn a lot about society and the human race's perception of it's own existence just from watching this film, so it'd be a great film for aliens that have invested interest in the human race.This is not a bad film, because it's refreshing and entertaining.

It TELLS you why the cinema is the ultimate art form, at the same time as it's SHOWING you. Richard Linklater really hit on something there, especially with that particular sequence.  But the entire film is suggestive in that way... It forces nothing on the audience, yet it makes sure we are aware of the possibilities and let's us make up our own minds.  A better way of putting it may be that Waking Life ASKS us what we think.This is the way movies should be.  It is flawless in its ambition, unrivaled in its originality, and made selflessly without the slightest thought of \"selling\" it to the American public.  It is obvious to me that both Linklater and Art director,Bob Sabiston, treated this film like they were proud parents to a gifted child... and couldn't wait to unleash it upon the world.Anyone who has the slightest interest in seeing how far ART can go... watch Waking Life as many times as possible.",

Dick. I remember thinking at the end: well, that sounds like one of Dick's schizo-fantasies, such as the kind detailed in his book Valis -- I wasn't excited into accepting it as some profound metaphysical insight.

We wander through life never reaching out beyond the scope of our own reality, until something comes along that forces us to do so. Directors, writers, and producers should all take note of this stunning film. This is what cinema is all about. It is one thing to entertain, but it is another to truly captivate an audience and make them think. The blending of philosophy, narrative, eye popping visuals, culture, arts, performance, and acting made this movie a joy to watch. I often found myself pausing the movie to ponder the ideals and questions this movie brought to light only to get lost in the depth of their revelations. This movie opened up profound ideas that when analyzed, peeled away like the layer of an onion revealing even more meaning beneath. This is not a movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat, or relies on action and special effects to captivate, but it is a film designed for the thinker in all of us. How refreshing it is to see a film like this on the shelves when so many have missed the mark. I feel this film did exactly what it intended and accomplished the goal that it sought after. This movie will not make millions in the box office or be seen as the greatest film of all time. It may never win an Oscar, but in the hearts of many dreamers and thinkers it will go down in history.

There's nothing fresh or new or insightful conveyed in the dialog.

I'm reluctant to use the term acting, seeing as how the only acting done is by voice. Yes, the artistic visuals and style add to the attractiveness of the film and, no doubt, add to the hype as well. But if we are unable to detect the physical qualities of acting, such as the intricacies of facial expressions and the many emotions they convey, then let's not go so far as to say it's \"acted beautifully.\"Here on IMDb, one reviewer of Waking Life wrote: \"See this film. It will remind you of how thrilling it is to be an active thinking, feeling member of the human race.\" This is a comment that unfortunately says more about the reviewer than the film itself. You shouldn't need a movie to remind you that you're a sentient being. Furthermore, you don't need to see Waking Life to think deeply.

This movie shows this is not necessarily true: if you mute it you won't understand a thing, but yet the images cause a significant impression that wouldn't be so lively expressed on the text. In other words, the visual part is important among the movie. In content, this is one of the most complex film I've ever seen. Not because the plotline, which by the way is quite simple, but due to the character discourses. Practically every character on the movie handles an elaborated speech, each of one ventures in the most different areas of human thinking, from modern philosophy, passing through psychanalysis, to cinematographic theory. Keep an eye on this last one, which I prefer most in contrast with the one displayed at the beginning of this text.

(Not that there's anything fresh to be spoiled anyways)This movie is rife with pretension and I am quite shocked to learn that actual UT Austin professors were used in this movie. This film seems to be afraid of becoming anything more than a series of mini- interviews/vignettes.If this movie truly wanted to be audacious, it would have to have made more than a few brief subtle references to Hegel. And it would have at least made some mention of Marx. But, unsurprisingly, this is a movie for the masses and we can't have any communist revolutions now can we?In addition, since when is something produced by 'Fox Searchlight' considered 'indie'? The other Linklater film, A Scanner Darkly (also horrible) was produced by 'Warner Bros. Independent Pictures'... an oxymoron... no?The shallow questions asked in this movie have shallow answers, examples abound.The discussions about God are largely irrelevant especially to a properly (emphasis) educated audience.The gas can man and the loudspeaker car were near riots I'm sad and sorry to say. If the gas man wants a voice, he should get an education so that then, maybe he'll have opinions that matter... the ignorant are ignored for a reason after all. The driver of the car, for all his rants, made no mention of Marx whom he should have mentioned if he wanted people to 'wake up.'And the chemistry prof's little tirade about neo-humans and humans? Are you kidding me? A discussion of evolution with no mention of Hegel? This guy should stick to his day job: which appears to have been biochemistry; and leave philosophy to genuine philosophers. These are just a few of the jokes you're in for when you see this movie.",

I understand it was filmed live action then every frame was painted to make it animation. But the kicker is it's different styles of animation, of colour, of texture. Sometimes it's like a pastel drawing come to life, in another passage it's a like an oil painting speaking then another it is water colours in motion and words.

While serving a great introduction to lucid dreaming and philosophy of life, it lacks many essential qualities of a good film. Characters:The film revolves around Wiggin's character. An explorer of his subconscious, he learns from himself the meaning of life. Throughout the film, we see him grow from his humble beginnings as a simple observer\u2014 but there isn't much to it. The rest of the characters, or rather, projections of his subconscious, don't have much depth or growth to them. As a result, it's pretty hard to identify with any of the characters and care about any outcomes of the movie. Screenplay:Thrown at us are a bunch of theories and philosophies, overheard by the protagonist at some point in his life. \"They all sound familiar, like I'd heard them from somewhere.\" At this point in his life, his subconscious chooses to hash them out a bit.While the theories and views of life are in themselves interesting, the protagonist and the audience is, for the most part, sitting quietly at a lecture. There are no debates, few real discussions, and nothing for the audience to look forward to or invest in.In addition, the theories are strewn together seemingly randomly while potentially being quite hard to digest, when not acclimated. They don't build upon each other, or follow any kind of logical path. There is no questioning, refutation, conflict, or conclusion. We are just going from one rambling lecture to the next, learning of the raw theory.On the other hand, it paints a realistic picture of the philosophical dreams we may have. And there is a nice homage to Before Sunset/Sunrise.Nevertheless, there are a number of clues that give a deeper meaning and interpretation to the film.Cinematography:This movie of well known for its unique rotoscoping animation. It gives an accurate visceral feeling of the dreamworld: walking the line of reality and fantasy. While it can be a bit nauseating or old at times, there is always something interesting to watch.The score, mostly written and performed by the Tosca Tango Orchestra, is excellent. The tango club scene's music, in particular, was scintillating. Two of my favorite instruments: accordion and piano, in beautiful harmony. The score does a good job of letting us relax between the heavy dialog, without being haughty or seeping into every scene.Emotional:The film does a great job of introducing people to areas of abstract thought about life and of lucid dream. Combined with the rambling stream of passion given characters and meaning behind the film, it reaches a certain level of appreciation for me.",

Actually, the criticism by the author of that line, who said people who liked the film _Waking Life_ would say that, does try to make two points. He says the film is a series of philosophical and psychological 'intros' presented with pictures. He longed for a 'story'. As to the former, yes, what we see presented is the presentation of a series of elementary philosophical ideas. If Americans weren't largely an anti-intellectual people, and mostly uneducated, I'd tend to agree that a movie that only touches upon the ideas presented would need greater depth. However, because doing such a movie with depth would simply be unsustainable in the present culture, the movie 'worked' for me as I experienced seeing it through the eyes of someone for whom these ideas would be new. (In fact, in homeschooling my son, I showed it to him.) As to the other point, the absence of 'story' is more of a matter of perspective than not. I found a 'story' there.So, even though I liked Monsters, Inc. a lot, I do say: Why don't you just go watch Monsters, Inc., then?",

This movie in my opinion, is a 10 because people will be talking about for years to come.Personally I love this movie. I find it inspiring, thought-provoking and highly entertaining. It is art, and as with all art it is highly subjective. I take offense to being labeled as pretentious, haughty or snotty, or what ever insinuation you would like to infer about me because 98% of this movie flew right over your head. (This statement is not intended to be judgmental, I understand that not everybody is interested in philosophy, and mental stimulation of this variety; the world would be insufferable if that were the case.) However, by the same token I don't appreciate the assumption that I am some pseudo-intellectual college freshman stoner or whatever your art/philosophy/film/English major qualifies you to label me because I found this movie insightful. Regardless of whether or not YOU knew everything this movie had to say before you seen it, perhaps you should not criticize and attack others because they weren't as fully enlightened as yourself. Assuming that you did not inherently acquire your vast knowledge at birth, we all had to start somewhere.And if you would like to learn more about philosophy or lucid dreams and in the process see one hell of a trippy movie, this is a great place to start!

Close-minded moviegoers beware: it does not follow a linear storyline, and it contains many heavy-duty ideas (probably more serious, real-world Notions than every Hollywood film released all year, put together).Filmed in live-action and then animated overtop using CGI-assisted rotoscoping, Waking Life has a completely unique visual style. It has the motion and rhythm of real life, and the colour and vibrancy of a cartoon universe. The juxtaposition is crucial to the film's themes, because it constantly forces us to ask what kind of world we're watching. People may talk like they're real, yet look like something out of a dream, or vice versa.The idea of \"dream\" is at the heart of Waking Life. Like Mulholland Drive, another taboo-breaking film made in 2001, it has a dream-logic and a consistent dream-atmosphere (the latter largely due to the animation and the brilliant soundtrack). It leads you gently through a character's waking life and into his dream life, and then blurs the boundaries between them until the difference is irrelevant.Richard Linklater, who directed Slackers and Dazed and Confused, loves filming characters who speak passionately and articulately. In Waking Life, he's combined that rare cinematic focus with a visual style that also speaks volumes. The result is a talky film that will make you think, and feel, and dream.See it on DVD if you can.",

Then, as the movie progresses, he realizes that he cannot wake up. During the movie, he wanders into people who speak their philosophies to him. At certain points, he wakes up in bed unable to read his clock or turn off the lights -- signs he is really dreaming. The movie is rotoscoped: there is a live action film taking place but we are seeing artists' rendition of the movie. This is the highlight of the movie...even if they seem to get a little too clever for their own good. The lead character (Wiley) changes shape and hue as do the people he comes across. At this point, most every scene in the film is suitable for framing.However, what doesn't work as well are the long scenes of philosophy and \"ironic\" scenes of violence. Time after time, we are presented with people spouting out pop-philosophy. At best, the ideas presented are worthy of a second thought (How much of our lives are on auto-pilot, and why are we content sleep walking through real life while trying to attain more realisitic dreams?). At worst, this is what represents the worst about pop-philosophy: say something that sounds deep on the surface to get people impressed with your mind. The movie provides no one to counter the people giving their opinions; it just allows them to speak their contradictaroy minds with no one to call their bluff. In addition, one of the features on the disc is a running text commentary. This again is a mixed blessing: it gives us a list of who is who on the movie and explains the thinking of the director. However, it gets too cute with itself telling us to think about the ironies of two people gunning themselves down, or the 'irony' of a man setting himself on fire with gasoline while in Texas (with all of it's oil, get it?)But overall, this is worth a rental. You'll have to sit through a lot of people who like to hear themselves speak, but there's enough to the movie to recommend it.",

The visual style of Waking Life is interesting -- an artistic rotoscoping over life action that is used brilliantly to compliment the dialogue.But the dialogue is the heart of Waking Life.  The film is a series of conversations, more like lectures, about reality, time, being, free will, identity.  Some great films have touched on these ideas before.  For instance, Mystery of Rampo weaves many of the same questions into an elegant, erotic story.  Lain handles these questions in the context of a mystery unfolding as a series of overwhelming revelations.  Prospero's Books creates a lavish, visual universe where identity is a fluid concept.Waking life, however, has almost no plot -- it is entirely a work of philosophy, and as such goes beyond any previous films.  I suspect most people will not like Waking Life, or at best will enjoy it only for the visual style.  But if you tend to question fundamental assumptions of reality, if you recognize that, far from being pretentious and meaningless, these questions are the most important questions of all, then this is your movie.",

The philosophy speeches are intriguing, and so what if any \"first-year philosophy student\" would know it -- how often do you see a movie try to reach these intellectual levels?

Without the remarkable draw-over, rotoscoping, Flash, and whatever else was used to \"colorize\" it, \"Waking Life\" would be a very dull sophomore film student project.

Listening to kids blather on about themselves and their magnificent minds for an hour and a half is NOT my idea of a good time.After all, this film is from the same man who made \"Slackers\". Surely he knew he was being ironic when he showcased passionate speeches about creativity, freedom, love, and self-realization coming from people who are visibly and bitterly thwarted in all those areas, mainly by the isolation imposed by their own intellectual ivory towers.

Before sunset, Before sunrise and even Dazed and Confused, had already established him as an incredibly skilled director who was capable of crafting great movies dealing with important issues by writing extremely believable dialogs. And i think that is the key of my liking of this director in particular, his style of directing and, more specifically, his dialog seems so fresh and effortless, that you almost feel interacting with the characters in his movies. Waking life is no exception. In waking life we find ourselves going through a journey of self-discovery of the protagonist, who is traveling from dream to dream meeting and talking to all kinds of people about all kinds of subjects. The movie is based on the concept of lucid dreams, which is a state in which you know that you are dreaming, which practically enables you to wander and analyze and interpret every knowledge, experience or thoughts that you might have in an incomparable depth. That is exactly what the character does in his journey, he talks with all the people he meets in his dreams about subjects we all think about but rarely deal with them in such a great depth. As i said earlier in those conversations you can see the genius of Richard Linklater, because he presents this major philosophical subjects as things we all think about on day to day basis. The dialog is so engaging that you almost feel inside this dreams. Although the leading character doesn't have much dialog, i think it is done on purpose, because it enabled me to feel as if i was experiencing these dreams from first hand. The visuals of the movie are stunning, the animation that Linklater uses is beautifully confusing and unstable, just like dreams are. Is almost a therapeutically experience, every time i see it, it feels that way. It is an excellent movie, and i highly recommend it. Great direction, Great movie",

If thinking films make you itch, there's lighter Linklater out there, and thousands of cartoons. If you want to go into the deep end of the pool about people thinking about people, this is the disk to spin. And tell me...do light switches work in *your* dreams?

            "content": "People don't want to think. They don't want to be expected to think. They feel trivialized and shallow when others around them think more than they do. They are intimidated by those who are willing to express their thoughts to others, and expect others to express their thoughts to them. They are bored with the idea of sharing thoughts and knowledge simply for the sake of expanding one's own personal perceptual and experiential boundaries. People don't like to think that there are other people out there that are smarter than them, that think more than them, that are more in tune with life, reality, existence, whatever you want to call that which we experience.I am honestly disappointed, discouraged by the idea that for many people, their own perception and their own view of reality is absolute. They simply live, simply react to that which happens to them, they cannot find it within themselves to question the fundamental beliefs upon which their fragile existences rest. I must admit, it is hard to question. It is especially hard to question oneself, to truly turn the analytical eyeglass upon one's own exchanges, one's own beliefs. If we are to always question everything that we believe, how then can we function? How are we able to make decisions, to have moral values, to have roots through which we may absorb the sweet experiences of this life? It is a difficult question, and it has no clear answer. As one who is constantly questioning, as one who will come upon a solution only to have a dozen contradictory solutions present themselves, I can only say that it is possible to live while always questioning; in fact, I would venture to say that it is the only way to live. It is something of a paradox to consider that any question is motivated by powers that would have an answer for such a question, that would seek absolutes, and that would attempt to give reasonable definition to the experience and perception of living. It is also paradoxical that the notion of asking questions without any definite answers is in fact an answer to many other questions. If there is no answer, the answer is that there is no answer. We are all primarily motivated by our need to define and live within set and realistic, comfortable boundaries. We are conscious of this drive at times, but never enough so to truly appreciate the rate and intensity of our definitions and boundaries.Consider that there are an infinite number of definitions, and an infinite number of boundaries. Thus there are no definitions, and there are no boundaries.I have no qualms with people who did not enjoy or accept this movie. I simply have a question for them. What are you afraid of?",

            "content": "I was chatting to an Aussie friend who mentioned this movie to me. He was so enthusiastic about it that I went out and hired it and I was glad I did.First off, it's a Richard Linklater concept and I love his movies. Sure, there's always some pretentiousness in his work but I still feel that in all his projects to date, he's accurately captured REAL people on film, expressing ideas, displaying emotions, revealing facets of the human condition to which we can all relate in some way, no matter what our backgrounds, ideologies etc.Second was the manner in which the movie was presented. It was originally shot on digital video and then 90% of it was rotoscoped (a technique of which I'm not usually a big fan), creating a stunning visual effect that really brings the dreaming aspect of the movie to life in a spectacular way. The other 10% of the movie has actually been replaced by standard animation (see the 'ant/zombie autopilot' scene as an example) which seems odd to me but maybe there's something I missed in this that's supposed to add something. Not sure. In addition to this, you have brief animated flashes used to convey particular ideas/events/images. It works really well.The movie at its most base is a series of vignettes loosely linked by the dreamworld explorations of a teenage boy, trying to make sense of the world in which he finds himself. He dreams, he wakes up, he wanders around and listens to fascinating (though not necessarily insightful) philosophical discussions about the nature of reality before discovering that he's still dreaming.Despite the ludicrous high-falutin' talk of some characters and the arty-farty subject matter that will deter many people, I recommend this movie to everybody. If you're the sort of person who likes to think on 'the big issues' then this movie will provide stimulation for the brain, even if there's nothing new for you. If you're the sort of person who appreciates a good idea, this movie will provide a new twist on the 'talking heads' genre. If you simply want to relax, just look at the funky images and absorb the atmosphere - you can ignore the dialogue ;-)Although I felt the ending was ultimately weak (Linklater builds us up to a revelation and then fails to deliver) I still think this is his finest work to date and can easily forgive him this as the subject matter is such that the revelation should be an intensely personal thing anyway (although it would have been nice to see his view).I shall definitely be adding this to my collection at some point in the near future and urge anybody/everybody with the slightest ounce of spiritual curiousity to do the same.",

Though the shaky style of animation takes some initial getting used to, the artwork is as beautiful and intriguing as the sentiments expressed by the film's characters.  This is like no other film I've ever seen; it consists of an only loosely-connected series of conversations and monologues, but it rarely loses steam or fails to keep the audience's interest.

There is one rant in the middle that is a bit hard to take for it's crude content but the rest of the movie is pretty easy if you are the sensitive type.I liked the soundtrack.

            "content": "Waking Life is one of those films that one really needs to see to believe. It is without a doubt the strangest film I have, or likely ever will see. Waking Life is all about the open discussion of surreal topics that common day people often consider too awkward to discuss. The film is shot with rotoscope animation, which means it was filmed in live action and edited with animation. The animation constantly changes styles and works to establish the surreal atmosphere and act as a direct system of symbolism. It works well and adds another layer to the experience. Waking Life resembles a documentary, jumping from one random person to another as they monologue or give an anecdote. Approximately half of the film centers around an unnamed protagonist wandering through the universe and interviewing several people about the characteristics of lucid dreams. The rest of the film touches on a number of topics including the meaning of life, brain activity, politics and free will. And herein lies the main problem with Waking Life, it tries to do too much. About half of the segments are compelling and interesting, a majority of them on the dream subject. The rest encounter a multitude of issues. A lot of the monologues are spoken very quickly with a lot of strong information that the film does not give the viewer time to take in. It tries to drill philosophy and psychology into one's head, often on subject which the viewer has little to no background knowledge. There is one segment where existentialism is discussed. While I've heard of existentialism before, I'd have liked to receive a formal definition before being thrust into a deep discussion. There were times when I was just praying for the film to shut up and take a breath. Because of this, one must accept a passive role in watching the film, which makes parts of it boring. This is exacerbated by the fact the film is nonlinear, constantly changing subjects, occasionally revisiting several, with no consistent pattern. The film's purpose becomes highly confusing and some debates receive no resolution. Granted that's likely intentional, but it doesn't add to the experience. Some segments seem to serve no purpose at all. There is one scene with a man in a jail cell ranting about how he wants to burn somebody. I was simply baffled at its mere existence, let alone its message, which I couldn't decipher. However, the scenes and discussions that are comprehensible and presented well are beyond incredible. They really make the viewer think about their own personal psyche, even days after the film's conclusion. The scenes focused on dreaming and the story arc with the protagonist is where the film really shines, and again, you can only understand if you see it. The conversations he is engaged seem to be in their own universe, and each in a different one. The film appears to collect its thoughts and becomes much more linear towards the end which ends the experience on a high note. I won't exactly say I enjoyed Waking Life, but I heavily admire it for its ambition and atmosphere. Despite its numerous drawbacks, I'm choosing to label Waking Life as a must see film for everyone. This is primarily because no two viewers will have the same experience. Everyone will interpret the film's messages differently; and while I may not have been able to completely immerse myself in all of the film's content, I'm sure certain people will fare better. That and the film is truly one of a kind. Whether one loves or hates Waking Life, it certainly is 99 minutes that one won't soon forget.",

            "content": "The main problem with this film is that it only very loosely fits the criteria for being a film in the traditional sense i.e. a story with a narrative arc. When watching this film for the first time one could be forgiven for thinking after the first say 40 minutes that the film does not have a plot at all but is just a collection of found footage (albeit clips with similar subject matter) that has been animated over as a mere exercise. I'm still not sure that the film really is much more than this. Anyway, the idea binding all these clips (primarily philosophically minded monologues) together - i actually loved, i think is a stunning idea beautifully executed. The core of the film, the unifying idea, is absolutely great, what is in question here is the bulk of the film, the content of it, that would not really damage the film in any significant way if it were to be cut out.This is not to say that Linklater is entirely unjustified in cramming his film with this loosely related, very mixed bag of intellectual mumblings. The plot of the film is basically a kid dreaming about lots of philosophical conversations, so having a film full of conversations seems like a perfectly reasonable thing to do considering this. It's just that a line needs to be drawn somewhere. Theoretically you could have a film that was a week long and consisted of nothing but conversations. This is an extreme example but what's important in a film like this, is that you don't outstay your welcome with this not entirely necessary material and that you ensure that the audience knows why they're sitting through this stuff as opposed to feeling like they've wandered into the wrong cinema screen, having expected to see a real film and not a loosely cobbled together documentary. The film in fact, i think, would have a very hard time indeed, proving that it wasn't merely a poorly executed documentary, were it not for the animation technique used that keeps everything faintly within the realm of fantasy.In summary, my 1st problem with the bulk of this film is that there is perhaps too much of it, considering that it is really, non-essential material and that its not always clear exactly what you're watching and why you're expected to watch it.Another problem with this collected material is that a lot of it is crap. A lot of it is incredibly shallow, long-worded philosophy that teeters on the outermost brink of comprehensibility. Speaking frankly, if I'm going to watch a documentary about Determinism and Epistemology (which really is what this film is as much as it is a story about a kid dreaming) i want to hear from well-read philosophers who have something to say in plain English (which is something this film does have a certain amount of) as opposed to idiots with a taste for long-words who're out on a mission to do my head in.Anyway, thats all i have to say about this film really. The overall idea is absolutely beautiful, poignantly and chillingly executed, but the material that makes up the majority of the film is not entirely justifiable and largely quite irritating.",

Another quarter were there just because they felt they had to be there either because they went to Harvard or because it was an \"in thing\" to do.  The other half of the audience knew what was going on. Within the first five minutes I was blown away.  Granted, I'm a sucker for pretty much any kind of animation, but the way it was presented was amazing and truly felt like a dream.  The fact that there was no consistent animation style was a litle jarring at first but after about 10 minutes you got used to it. I'd say that Wiley Wiggins did an excellent job acting but he esentially was reacting to the philosophy that was being spouted at him throughout the course of the film.  It was acting in the vein of Kevin Smith as \"Silent Bob\" acting.  But once he was forced to confront his \"reality\" he did a good job. Its one of those movies you'll either love or hate.

I'm annoyed I wasted 1:38h of my 'waking life' (I now realise how ridiculous even the title is). I could've read a decent thesis in that amount of time. Bummer.",

            "content": "May serve as a pseudo spoiler.Yes, this is a movie, but not a very good one.  The only aspect that keeps you watching is the execution and variation of the animation.  Beyond the visual interest inherent in ever moving forms, this movie offers nothing else.In a pseudo dream world, Waking Life tries to deliver the impression of moving from a state of confusion to understanding.  To demonstrate this the writer throws a bunch of random ideas at the audience, then slowly introduces the main character who is then subjected to more random ideas, resulting in him being...enlightened (for lack of a better word).  The sequence of encounters that compose the movie just don't even come close to justifying the end.  Bad writing.As for these ideas that the main character as well as the audience is exposed to, they come in such a rapid fire pace that you're forced to accept them for if you allow any time for contemplation you'll miss the next segment.  In this way I felt like I was Alex from Kubrick's Clockwork Orange being brainwashed through a bombardment of images and ideas.Take away the interesting animation and you're left with these encounters which in and of themselves are one-sided conversations--one individual, usually sitting, spewing his/her notions at the camera.  How very dynamic (please note the sarcasm).  It seems as though the need to animate this movie arose from a need to make the movie interesting on at least one level since the writer and director were/was not able to do so.And you thought the Blair Witch Project had the worst handheld camera work that you've ever seen.  Can I get a round of applause, or more likely some projectile theatre vomiting, for this directorial decision.All in all...I am glad I saw this film simple as a means of acknowledging this form of amazing animation.  I hope that the lack of quality inherent in this film doesn't make it hard for someone to utilize this technology to greater ends in the future.",

With a plot centered around one person's search for definition and a style that literally overlays animation and live action, anyone searching for an action flick will be sorely disappointed with this movie. That said, a philosophy student would probably love it. Waking Life looks at how a postmodern individual attempts to understand his existence. Premising much of the movie's dialogue upon the concept of lucid dreaming, the writer of Waking Life pretty much offers viewers a two hour discussion.I found this film interesting by the end, though it was slow-moving and I had to initially force myself to continue watching. It was good to see many ideas that I and my friends have long-since discussed into the ground covered in a feature length film, though I think that anyone seriously interested in these ideas may already have thought of many of the ideas put forth in Waking Life. The musical scenes were intriguing but seem almost more a distraction to the film than a solid addition. A \"sketched\" animation technique takes some getting use to when one first begins watching the film. At points, it seems a bit distracting overall reinforces the confusion between real and imagined. In general, I would advise this film to anyone who is a serious movie-watcher and who wants a bit more thought provoking film. Watch it with a friend and be prepared to discuss some ideas after the credits roll.",

Since I watched Godfrey Regio's \"Koyaanisqatsi\" several years ago, I never found another movie so much worth of writing about it than \"Waking Life\".I think this is basically a story about dreamers and explorers. Dreamers of finding answers about life. Explorers of life in search of answers.Regardless of time and place, dreams are an essential piece of what make humans be what they are today. And most importantly so, what they want to be in the future.The movie presents thousands of thoughts about the nature of life and human beings, all through the eyes of a newborn dreamer-guy. And all by means of an astonishing animated style which swings from dream to reality all at one time.Regardless of the accuracy of ideas presented, this movie is surely one which should make us think and analyse our inner self, deep inside.

It's wonderful and innovative.The bad thing: Everything else.If Linklater's agenda was to make intellectually budding ninth graders start thinking about life, philosophy, film, and semiotics, then perhaps he didn't fall far from his mark. However, if you've ever attended the first day of any first-year humanities courses in a university, you should just save your money and not see the film.If you've ever sat in one of those trendy coffee shops where everyone has a soulpatch, passionately scribbles poetry, and discusses the meaning of life with their hipster friends, then you should also save your money and not see the film.However, if you're stoned out of your head and sitting in someone's living room and want to say, \"Whoah, cosmic!\" a lot, then I guess \"Waking Life\" wouldn't be a complete waste of time.Once again, Linklater wants his viewer to step back and comment on how amazingly brilliant the director is. Such astute dialogue! Such deep, meaningful subject matter! After all, it is about DREAMS, isn't it? People discuss, like, really meaningful stuff, don't they? And if you want a crash course in Bazinian film theory, elementary semiotics, and first-year philosophy, then this is probably cheaper than paying for tuition. But if hearing the phrase, \"You know, it's weird that the letters C-A-T in no way represent what a cat is, meaning the essence of a cat. The letters are just arbitrary symbols which we've accepted as the representation of 'a cat'\" isn't something completely alien to you, then you will be annoyed. Incredibly annoyed. So annoyed that you'll want to gnaw your arm off at the elbow.This film is unbearably pretentious. It's self-serving intellectual masturbation, and is therefore the cerebral equivalent of all Barbra Streisand movies, wherein she persistently tries to convince us that she's beautiful.The animation is brilliant.

It's not badly written, but it's every bit as worth watching, perhaps moreso because its fantasy is a fantasy we can all grip on to: Dreams.The conversations sound familiar. And the ones that I can't pin with a direct conversation I myself have had I find myself agreeing with.

And I doubt anyone who has already commented will come back to read this, but it is rather late at night, and I feel like a ramble. I think that the culmination of this film is the important part, and no matter whether you had heard of P.K. Dick's dream and subsequent philosophy on time before or not, the visual image of the dreamer saying 'yes' to God and floating 'on up' gave me a moment's pause. There is no separation from this experience and our own! Jung loved film because it was a way to play out all the archetypes at once; this film succeeds in this goal quite admirably. I still feel a vague sinking fear when confronted with the prospect of a dream from which I will never awake, but all of us who are not yet part of the unity experience this, whether we would like to believe so or not (please, let me know if I'm wrong!). Cynicism and being overly critical are just guises for this spiritual discomfort. I remember my first acid trip, when I felt like I would never really feel 'comfortable' again, and I wonder whether wide-eyed experience of the Godhead is really to be desired, or rather acclimation to it. This all depends on the role of consciousness after death, and the mode of its dissolution. If the dissolution is a slow, entrapping-yet-freeing process as experienced by the main character, I kind of feel like ripping the skin off my face. But the other option seems to be oblivion. What a state of things. Ramble over, doubt this will be useful, but I suppose we're all in this together...",

This is the movie and it is nothing more than intellectual phrases and opinions, not a movie at all.And it's not like anything that was said is ground breaking new or has been put in great perspective or insight, no, nothing. It's a messy collection of basic philosophical statements and they go just as randomly as they come. They don't build up, tell a story or provoke a special thought. The director covers this mess up by suggesting that he might dream ... yeah wow ...I love philosophy but this movie was absolutely nothing new, it could be for someone who never got in touch with philosophy but in this case I doubt this is what such a person could like. But at least they could say they liked it to impress others. :) I'm giving it 3 stars just for the appreciation of the visuals and the approach of a philosophical genre.

You may have deep, meaningful conversations about life, death, dreams, and everything else.  It is not a cartoon.Waking Life is one of the greatest movies I've ever seen, and I have seen quite a few.  Calling it a movie does not do it justice though, because it does not have a plot in the conventional sense.  It is a lengthy film following the journey of a young man through dreams, or is it reality, or is it both?  Wiley Wiggins, our protagonist through this film, travels around to various situations, listening in on, and joining fascinating conversations that can best be described as philosophical.  This movie is surreal.  That is all there is to it.  It is 99 minutes of conversation, so do not come in expecting explosions, romance, or any other of the usual Hollywood standards.  And yes, the film is animated, but not a cartoon. The entire film was shot on DV (digital video format) and then animated over on computers but over 25 different animators.  This gives Waking Life a look like nothing else you've ever seen, with a constantly evolving animation style.  Don't let the fact that it is animated scare you off, you'll be upset that you did.Overall, Waking Life is truly an incredible work.  Calling this movie a \"trip\", is an understatement, this will leave your head spinning for days. It's full of ideas and beliefs that people are rarely exposed to, or even think about, on a day-by-day basis.  Make sure you watch it with someone else, because you're going to want to do a lot of discussion afterwards. So do yourself a favor, go buy this movie...now.",

I have to concur with those folks who disliked the sophomoric, armchair philosophizing that makes up the bulk of the movie.None of the ideas are presented in any depth, and none are terribly insightful. As another post pointed out, its not unlike the sort of conversation you might have with a friend after a few (too many) drinks, but compressed into sound bites, and delivered with an unduly pedantic and bombastic tone.The first third or so of the movie consists of nothing but these abbreviated sententious pedagogical essays, one after another, and I got very antsy at the thought that the whole movie might offer nothing but this. Thankfully, it broadened its focus, and garnered a few laughs and went a few places in the last half.So, yeah, don't pay to see this in the theater.

And ever since then Goddard has been hanging around places like the Cannes Film Festival telling everybody that cinema is a dead art-form.What I wouldn't give to sit Goddard down in front of Richard Linklater's \"Waking Life\" and see if he truly believes that art in cinema is dead.This brilliant new film was shot on digital video and then a team of animators took years painstaking animating every frame.  The result is a film which is an assault of ideas on consciousness, our sub-conscious, life, death and our preceptions of the world we inhabit; punctuated with the most exuberantly exciting visuals that I have been seen in a film in a long time.The film centers around a philosophy student, (played by \"Dazed and Confused\"'s Wiley Wiggins.), who wanders around Austin, Texas encountering a lot of intellectuals, poets, philosophers and eccentrics.  As the main charcter wanders around, he notices there is something very bizarre about the world he is currently inhabiting.  His surroundings pulsate like a heartbeat, several existentialist philosophers morph into the very ideas that they are trying to communicate.  It soon becomes clear to our main character that he may in fact be dreaming.  Unfortunately for him, he seems to be trapped in his dream-state; waking up from one dream only to immediately enter into another one.  Amd then his plight appears to be even more drastic when it's suggested that he may in fact may be dead wandering around in some alternate state of consciousness.This is an incredible film jammed-packed with ideas and visuals.  The viewer is bombarded with ideas on how to live our lives and how to interpret our consciousness and sub-consciousness.  The film requires multiple viewings to even begin to process all these ideas.  I saw the film twice at the Toronto Film Festival and I know I have a long way to go before I can really grasp the depth of this film.  Linklater's past films, (\"Slacker\", \"Before Sunrise\"), discussed philosophical concepts, but this is the first time the director has directly tackled philosophical ideas head-on; discussing Kirkegard and St. Thomas Aquanis.  In the near-future, this movie will, most likely, be screened by just about every Philosophy professor in the english-speaking world.I have been saying for years that Richard Linklater is the most brilliant and gifted artist to emerge out of American cinema in the past decade; and with \"Waking Life\", he may finally get the respect he deserves.",

            "content": "Alright, as everyone else has pointed out, this movie has two levels (like most movies do) the story line and 'everything else'. When people say 'they filmed it then they animated it', don't think Bakshi. This isn't an attempt to enhance animation by basing it on the real world, it's an attempt to enhance film while acting as a plot device using animation. The effect is incredible. Some of it is silly, some of it is blatant, but in a movie as geared towards variety and exploration as this one is, these things should be expected, even applauded.As for the story line, well, there almost isn't one. This is definitely a case of 90% plot trying to support 10% actual story, a story you don't even really get a hint of (at least the first time through the movie) until you're already half way through. This, however, doesn't make it a bad story, just a different way of telling it. Unlike most films these days, which spoon feed you every possible relevant detail, Waking Life expects you to think and think hard.On a final note, I have heard a small minority, both in real life and on this message board, talk about how it's all cheap, pretentious philosophy. I assure you, this whining comes from people who took an entry level philosophy course, learned of the existence of all the basics like post-modernism and futurism and came to the conclusion that they understood them and that was that. What's pretentious is pretending you're intelligent by trashing a movie because it draws from sources you can associate with your 101 philosophy class. We're so sorry it didn't just focus on guns and breasts. Suffice to say, anyone calling this movie pretentious is simply being pretentious, trying to seem clever by saying \"Well, it didn't make ME think.\"  Big surprise there. For future reference, philosophies don't just become 'old hat' once you've heard them once. They exist for you to explore consciously, not for you to say 'heard it, bring on the explosions.'Overall, Waking Life is appealing because it does explore, on the surface, ideas that rarely make it into popular film at all these days, and when they do usually have to be dredged from the depths. It uses devices on all fronts that break from the norm, and just generally proves that film can be true art without completely abandoning any sense of coherency.",

With a movie like that, it is easy to suspend one's disbelief infinitely, in other words, there can be no concept of time, no plot holes, nothing realistically has to make sense. This gives the movie a complete freedom. A string of characters, conversations and moments that have one thing in common: a seemingly deep philosophical meaning. This is definitely a movie that requires its viewer to have an open and curious mind. It may or may not make anybody happy, sad or angry. It may not make anybody feel anything.

I think I'll have to wait longer than that for anything to come out about it.I don't think this film has anything too extremely deep to say rather I consider it much like films such as being john malkovich where the general public who is so dumbed down will think that any movie that says something that makes them think is deep.  I'm not a huge philosopher guy(my terminology there makes this aparent), but I've still heard the majority of stuff that took place in that in film before.  If left me with little to think about, but I still really enjoyed the way that it was all tied together.One of my pet peeves in a film is when it goes through and has an excellent narrative and then at the end messes everything up by going into complete wierdness.  I guess I enjoyed the other way around where there's an utterly wierd film and then all of the sudden like out of nowhere there's narrative.\nAs I go on here I just think that I really liked that movie in a way I can't explain. I enjoyed the dialouge, even though it didn't make me think much about anything, when I'd really thought most of that stuff before.  Maybe I'm a psuedo philosopher one thing I noticed upon studying descartes was that he was writing about ideas that I thought up and then these ideas proceeded to scare the crap out of me when I was ten and was having trouble falling asleep(I was a real amnesiac back in the day).  However, that would fall into the same crap that Ethan Hawk was saying in that movie about once an idea is out there you can somehow pick up on it.  I guess I just enjoy stuff like that.The other thing I'm thinking is that maybe intentional that this stuff is not meant to make you think to much, but rather just to show you how this guy discovered he was living in a dream state.The main thing about that movie that caused me to give it a rating of 9 out 10 is that I imensely enjoyed myself watching the film.  and while I can think of tons of reasons why not to like it and then as a consequence try to come up with justifications for liking it I can't really do either.  all I can say is there's something about it that caused it all to click.Synopsis - Not Deep, Don't understand why I like it, very entertaining.",

First of all, I would like to state that I was appalled by this refrence, as well as the remark concerning the \"ow, wow! highschool generation\". I too see little hope in todays teens, however this film is quite out of reach of the general public.  The ideas in this film managed to maintain a quite dignity without being presumptuous and assuming that the viewer is able to understand the grand terms and psychological britter-bratter that some other films may use.  It is a great experience to watch the animated film illuminate your television screen with visual communication like an acid trip. I suggest this movie to anyone who wants to be introduced to philosophy and understand more clearly the subject of lucid dreaming. If you think the story goes nowhere about 20mins. or so into it than you are very wrong but probably a member of the \"general public\" and wouldn't like the ending anyway. But if you have the ability to appreciate creativity and artful cinematography than watch \"Waking Life\".",

            "review_title": "Good idea, however... (slight spoilers)",
            "content": "Waking Life has been hailed by critics and audiences alike as \"brilliant\", and while most of the dialogue, along with the theme of the movie, is rather gripping, to me the movie ultimately came through as a smoke and mirrors show.The movie is about a young man searching for an answer to the question: \"Are we sleep walking through our waking life or wake walking through our sleeping life?\". Throughout the movie, you witness various conversations between people pondering this question among other things that we would tie in with the meaning of life. The dialogue is great in the sense that it shows a higher level of thought than you encounter with most movies, however, this is also where the movie becomes rather transparent. While the theme of the movie should provide a rather gripping storyline, there really is no story. The movie erratically pulls you from one conversation to the next, and while it provides you with a reason for this at the end, it really just seems like an excuse for the movie trying too hard to sound intelligent. A movie like, let's say, Donnie Darko, provides you with engaging philosophical dialogue that also creates a bond between you and the character. Waking Life provides no such character development. Most movies that try to make the viewer think start with an idea and then the writers say \"how can we make the characters interesting and also make the dialogue appealing to someone who is a deep thinker?\". Waking Life seems like they came up with the dialogue and then said \"well let's make up some characters to say all this stuff and then piece it into a film\". This is why the movie ultimately fails in my mind. The characters are boring and one dimensional, with the only personality types really being thoughtful, caring, and philosophical with three or four more outlandish speakers. You don't care what happens to the characters, and while you want to hear what they have to say, they are just so incredibly boring that you feel restless. After about the third or forth conversation you think to yourself \"is this all it is?\". All these people seem to be looking for the meaning of life but they will obviously never find it because they appear not to have lives. They sit secluded from the rest of society spending all their time pondering the meaning of life without realizing that while it is important to ask the big questions, you will never even come close to finding out the meaning of life unless you go out and have real life experiences. This is ironic because it is apparent that the movie is trying to make you admire these characters through their thought provoking speeches, and trust me, they are less than admirable, in fact a better word would be pathetic. Some of the questions these people pose aren't even that deep. One woman tells her friend: \"You know how our cells continuously regenerate? Well every seven years we are composed of completely new cells than we were before, but if I am composed of all new cells how can I be the same person?\". Am I the only one who knows anything about cytology? It's simple honey, your cells divide through binary fission, and every cell is identical to its predecessor. A skin cell is going to be the same as every other skin cell you have had, same goes for a brain cell, and that's why you are the same. Somehow they even ruined the cinematography, which originally seemed brilliant. The animated characters always seem to be warping or twisting, and if they aren't the background is. I couldn't help but feeling though that if they had developed the characters more, they could have done more with this style of animation to dazzle the viewer.I can use one word to describe this movie: pretentious. It talks the talk but it really doesn't walk the walk. It's got great dialogue but the characters and story have no substance, and if all you've got is thought provoking dialogue, write a thesis and leave it at that. Don't even rent Waking Life, because you'll probably watch about 20 minutes of it before you see right through it.",

However, Waking Life also deals with the subject matter of dreams, and how they relate to life.

And this is like my little window to the world...\", says the boat car guy in the beginning of the movie. That \u0084little window to the world\" is a metaphor for perspective, the \u0084transport\" is a characterization of that perspective as \u0084mine\". We all perceive the world through our own unique little windows, biased to our own perspective, to the way of seeing things from our point of view. Every crossway we find ourselves in as far as it goes determines the course of our life because, while we choose the way to go from there, we don't choose the crossway itself, that particular point of departure, or the possibilities which are confined to the human reality. Nevertheless that reality which we find ourselves in is the same for all of us but the way we perceive it (interpret it) can be radically different. The movie is practically about those different perspectives or, to be more precise, about exposing the bias of our interpretations of reality. It does not try to answer the question (at least directly) about which is the right way of seeing things but rather tries to show the absurdness of the question itself. The obvious contrarieties which appear among the views presented in the movie are meant not to present different, independent ideas so we could then choose which are the right ones but to shake us up, to question the question, to realize the playfulness of it all and therefore to comprehend that we should not take seriously any of it. It is a wake up call. And to wake up here means not to escape from the dream to somewhere else (we can not escape from this dream, same as the main character of movie, because the dream is our wakening life itself) but to realize our own freedom in constituting it.",

He is unable to make distinctions between what is real or unreal and in the end, having no real dreams of his own, is swept away into nothingness.Dream is Destiny.Like many, Wiggins has no real thoughts or ideas of his own and is a passivespectator of life who spends his waking life just killing time. Like the people who find this movie boring, Wiggins is the result of externalizing all things in life while avoiding any attempt at introspection or concluding thoughts with actions. It is exactly this type of \"individual\" that the movie is projecting. The film is not an attack nor is it delivered in a condescending way but is rendered in a eriedesperation of sorts where a film director really has no way of communicating effectively to the Wiggins of the world, or Wiggins in the theater, anythingmeaningful or truthful that they will understand. In one scene, Wiggens is yet again in a \"one speaking to many\" speech by a morphing humanist / evolutionist professor who is so entrenched with the modern bankrupt philosophy ofindividualism that he has overlooked the fact that he is part of a living species himself. In other words, this professor views human life and people like lab mice and hopes that the new neo-human might one day disply traits like truth andjustice naturally.

The plot is concerned with dreams and so the film is set in an intricate, frightening and yet strangely intriguing dream experienced by the dream character. Only the idea to create a movie set inside a dream is inspirational, and the way it's been done takes my breath away: the characters' speech and behaviour is so extremely dreamlike that i almost get the feeling that the director (Richard Linklater) has recorded one of my dreams and then recreated it.This is no ordinary movie but for anyone who tend to appreciate that, this is a real pearl.

Some of the animation was nearly photographic, flowing into surrealistic images that spoke to underlying emotional charges. All the backgrounds were unstable, adding to the uncertainty of what was real and what was only preferred perception -- or even unconscious, socially-defined perception. Even tho this cinematic statement was about dreaming, I believe only those who are awake will be able to follow the message.When I searched out and found the film on this website, the featured review was quite negative. It does the film a disservice to feature, as the only one, a review by someone who obviously doesn't have any idea of what this film is about. If you are a seeker and a dreamer, this offbeat film is a must-see.",

On one hand the animation is excellent and entertaining, but on the other the dialogue is so in-cohesive and unnecessarily pretentious it becomes unbearable.The film tries to tackle many interesting subjects which could potentially make excellent themes if actually integrated into a plot. However this movie basically boils down to a loose collection of random conversations and monologues about existence, spoken mainly in a pointlessly heavy, pseudo-intellectual stream of consciousness.I watched this film very soon after watching A Scanner Darkly and was almost certain I would enjoy it, but unfortunately I was let down by what seems like a director merely trying to show how deep his philosophical knowledge is. Apparently this film was an attempt by Linklater to get across the experience of lucid dreaming, and while the stylisation and haphazard structure do mimic dreams very well he forgot the important factor of actually making a movie watchable.I was bitterly disappointed by Waking Life as I enjoy films which go beyond simple story driven plots and ask questions of the viewer and wanted to add this one to the criminally small list. Instead it comes across as a lazy piece of script writing that simply presents it's ideas directly in dialogue instead of working them into a plot, almost desperate to make sure people know how intellectual it is.If you want to watch a film that discusses existentialism intelligently but with enough subtlety to be entertaining then watch I Heart Huckabees. If you want to watch a film that gets across the intense confusion and visual distortion of an acid trip then watch A Scanner Darkly.Just don't watch this film.",

            "content": "This movie is excruciating to watch.  It is virtually devoid of dialogue. Each scene consists of an (at least) five minute long monologue, where the character expounds on such and such issue about dreams, life and death. It was as tedious as Ayn Rand's work, where each chapter contains a ten-page diatribe, which one must wade through to get to the plot.  However, there IS no plot in this movie.  You get no reward for the eternal patience you must exhibit to sit through the entire film.  There is no humor, no suspense, no progress.  Just a series of overly pretentious thinkers who like to hear themselves talk.\nIt is not that i didn't find the philosophy behind this film interesting. On the contrary, i found it quite interesting.  But i still believe that the primary purpose of film is to entertain, before it educates.  Some movies (There's Something About Mary, for example) completely ignore the intellectual side of film media; this film not only ignores its humorous dictate, but actually kills it and leaves its body for the vultures.  I'm not saying that good film needs to be funny.  Plenty of dark-hearted dramas make my list of good movies, but they're are entertaining and engaging dramas; they have plot and character development.  They place the viewer inside of the film, where Waking Life alienates its viewers.  Each character pushes the audience away by being a two dimensional conduit for the screenwriter's philosophy.  Even the main character is rather flat, as he portrays the young man on a journey.  We learn nothing about his life or his personality; he is merely the wanderer, who meets many odd intellectuals during his eternal afterlife.  Basically, he is as flat as the film itself.I must say, however, that the film is visually stunning, and it was quite enjoyable to recognize the actors from their wobbly drawn caricatures. Unfortunately, the appearance of the film cannot salvage its seriously lacking plotline and characters.  Waking Life gets a 1 out of 10.",

The animation appeared to me to be real video that had been colored over using water paints or something wavy like that. At first I thought it might have been all animation, but the part with the boyfriend and girlfriend in the bed changed my mind. The boyfriend in that part appeared to be Ethan Hunt, just colored over. I am not sure if it was in deed Ethan Hunt but if not it sure looked a lot like him. The part that had the most impact on me was the same scene, the one with the boy and girl in the bed talking. The girl said sometimes she felt as though she was watching her life through the eyes of an old women. Sometimes it seems to me that I am watching my life through the eyes of another, not anyone in particular. Maybe not even that I'm watching my life, but that I think about what's going on in my life and it seems like I am thinking about another person's life and their struggles and problems. This movie I think was created in part because no one really knows the meaning of life and why were here, and this was one person's attempt at making sense of it all.

It talks in depth about different situations in life bringing them into different perspectives. It gets in depth on things in life, love, and about hate. When it switches into different scenes you never know what to expect next. Then the next scene comes up and you are drawn into the movie more and more not knowing what to expect. There is one point where a man was filling up a tank with gasoline and I couldn't even here the words after he asked for some matches because right away my mind was thinking they are going to blow up or is he going set something on fire (maybe a building or car...what?) and my mind could not even concentrate on the words being said anymore but just in curiosty of what he was going to do. Then finally he did what he did and it was something totally unexpected and my emotions did not know what to think or how to think about that situation. The scene that really caught my attention was the car scene where the guy does not know where he is going. Is this stating that he needs to find some sort of direction in his life or maybe to not do something that is expected of you but rather just release yourself and do anything you please and don't even worry about what will happen it will all work out in the end.

Not exactly a raucous Friday evening, to be sure, but it would be a shame if you ignored this film just because the premise is frightening.  Eschewing any real narrative, it manages to be genuinely funny, touching, and, above-all, thought-provoking.Something of a companion piece to Linklater's first movie, Slacker, the movie is Essentially a series of vignettes taking place in the mind of a dreaming Wiley Wiggins.  Many of the vignettes take the form of encounters between Wiggins and various characters apparently spun out of the recesses of his mind.  He more or less essentially listens as these characters present philosophies of life, dreams, and death - it is only late in the movie that his character really learns to interact or put perspective on events.The form of the movie definitely takes some getting used to - it was about 20 minutes until I really found a way to engage with the material.  The key for me was taking the slew of theory and information the movie throws at you and processing it not as objective lecture, but as subjective food-for-thought, a patchwork of thoughts and ideas not distinct in and of themselves but parts of a whole, watch of which can be accepted, rejected, or considered without doing the same to the whole movie.  My advice is to relax, and just sort of let the movie wash over you.Waking Life was filmed on DV and then rotoscoped, an animation technique of tracing live actors, and the effect is one of semi-constant movement - as Linklater described it, the whole movie \"breaths.\"  Its beautiful and wonderfully appropriate, a mesh of fantasy and realism that lends itself perfectly to the dream state content of the movie.There is lot lurking beneath the surface of this film, for anyone looking for a new and different movie experience, I highly recommend taking a look at Waking Life.",

This is even harder due to the completely non-cohesive plot - in other words, the mindless ramblings of the different characters in no way tie together; the movie just goes from one thought to the next with no transition. It's quite disappointing. You know what? I couldn't get past the ramblings. It is hard for me to imagine anyone but people high on LSD or some other hallucinogen enjoying this film - well other than those people who think any wordy movie that brings up conversations involving life or the hereafter is a good movie. Just because most films don't address these topics doesn't make a film that does a quality film. I really couldn't tell if the acting was any good. In this movie, how could you tell? The director obviously knew that the plot couldn't draw much attention so he used film editing. Now I know it was most likely meant to portray a dream like atmosphere, but one couldn't help thinking it was to draw attention away from the nauseating boredom of the scenes. I did enjoy the film editing, and the people I watched it with and talked to about the film said it was awesome because the editing was new, something they've never seen. Um - sorry - it's not new.

This film struck me as a poetic look at the idea behind the interpretations of the Orpheus and Eurydice myth by Gregory Orr. (One of his poem discusses Eurydice's want to remain \"dead\" and in the underworld.) The trip in this movie was for the main character to move from \"no\" to \"yes\" (objective to subjective), and understand that, once the dream-state is recognized, and even embraced, that anything (everything, in fact) is possible. An amusing approach to the classic premise.As a high school student still reeling in the novelty of reaching deeper into a piece of art, the format used in the movie struck me as having the potential to be incredibly powerful. Using several different artists changed each scene's point of view substantially, but the transitions were generally smooth. The entire concept was bursting with possibility, and I'd like to see it presented in other movies, although it seems to lend itself more to short films.Overall, I think there was far too much packed into this film to make sense of all its discussions in a single sitting. This movie could be amazing if presented over time as a series of semi-independent vingettes (i.e., on the Independent Film Channel, or an internet release.) See this movie.

Linklater Richard is doing a wonderful job over this movie that never ends and live u just a one feeling at the end of the movie - to see it again. was i dreaming all that ?",

I couldn't distinguish this movie from reality; I just recently started thinking that characters in movies should speak like people in real life (not with rehearsed, perfectly-annunciated, direct lines).  But, even on top of the reality lay the meaning of the characters' interactions.Philosophy laced the plot, ideas of existentialism, and people (including myself) being a dream of Tao pulsed into my mind (with or without the directors intent).  The movie was very eloquent and clear, but with a poetry vagueness, which allowed me to expand and think about the concepts in more detail.Well done",

            "content": "This is the first time I've ever written a comment on IMDb, mostly because this movie was so impressive, but also because of how misunderstood it seems to be. There is no doubt that this is a movie for people who like to think about and explore what lies behind our lives. But unfortunately some people just can't help but use a movie like this to pat themselves on the back, snub their noses and say things like, \"Although this movie lags conversations I've had by six months, it is still very interesting Similarly, another criticism is that the philosophical meat of this movie was unoriginal. Yes, most of what was discussed has probably been said or thought many times before, but not by everyone. To criticize \"Waking Life\" for being unoriginal is to miss the point. This movie was meant to coalesce a broad range of provocative thoughts into a singular, rambling piece of impressionistic art. Just like many people initially looked at Monet's work and said it was rubbish that could have been painted by a bad child artist, so will people criticize this film for being devoid of plot and originality because it is a different kind of movie. People are used to being spoon-fed big heaping mouthfuls of sugar and vinegar; hence the popularity of  \"Serendipity\" and \"13 Ghosts\". In contrast, this is a movie that tosses out small jewels, some that you will not catch because you will linger over the one before, until the end gives you a vague vision of reality, the whole that is the true \"plot\". There are several levels of the film, some of which I know I didn't see. First, it is a stunningly beautiful vision. The animation technique does mirror and modify what is being said, but it can be enjoyed immensely by itself. Second, the film is a sampling of provocative thoughts about what it means to be alive and what it means to be awake (versus in a dream). Third, it is a catalyst for us all to personally explore these topics. It is a mark of any good film that when we leave we continue to talk and think about the topics that were raised, but this film brings us to the next level. Like a catalyst it acts to speed up our thoughts on the topic and allows us to explore in ways that previously we could not. Ultimately it is about inverses, and is itself an inverse. Characters espouse the value of guns and end up shooting each other. It is set on land that is in constant motion like the sea. Dead people think they are alive and live people think they are dead. It is about dreaming but is called \"Waking Life\".",

Through a combination of Characters from his past films and his unique style of filming in the real, and changing it into a different series of animation types, hard to adapt a first then easily accepted, he has combined a number of philosophies of life into a film understood only through reflection.I am plagued with a new found desire to control my dreams. Through a series of abstract characters, a man finds himself listening to the ideas and thinking of brilliant minds. He finds himself in a dream he cannot wake up from, and through the words of one of the characters is an explanation why.The theories he is subject to slowly evolve into theories on dreams and eventually lead to theories and his understanding of why he is unable to wake up. A final acceptance of his situation, a higher learning.Such a film cannot be summed up in only one sentence, or many for that matter. A film, unique as this is can only be understood by the people who have seen in, one's comprehension of the film is likely differs from another's, yet in retrospect, they are same.So I now IMPLORE you to go out and see Waking Life, take your mind and understanding to a whole new level, discover a thought process you never use and..........discover yourself.",

            "content": "Richard Linklater's \"Waking Life\" is a colorful jaunt through the worlds of expressionism, philosophy, and existentialism.  The animation serves to more accurately accent the film's topics.  It has been said that his movie has no plot, but that is not the case at all.  The plot is there, it's just not the focal point of the movie, instead it is much like the animation in that it helps move the film's different parts along. Don't come into the theater merely expecting to observe a film, though.  If you do, then this movie will bore the hell out of you, as the animation alone can only hold it up for so long.  Instead view it as a chance to think about deeper things than your everyday cinematic regiment addresses.  View it as both a learning and a purging process. If you just sit back and watch, you'll completely miss the full effect of the movie.  Linklater is the kind of director that doesn't just write a happy little, easily understandable story and show it to you saying, \"Look what I made!\"  Instead, he makes you really think and work to comprehend what you're experiencing.  But in the end, it's a better movie for that, in that by the end of the film you feel a sense of achievement.  This movie will make you look at every other film you've ever seen and make them look like they lack substance. \"Waking Life\" takes you through Wiley Wiggins search for reality while he meets a cast of interesting, distinguishable characters who tell him the same thing, but from a different point of view everytime (IE- sociological, scientific, religious, artistic).  The film also makes insightful, and often humorous, social commentary (the scene with the two men at the bar about gun control is nothing short of genius). It's definitely one of those movies that makes you think, and you'll definitely find that you have the characters voices in your head for possibly days to come.  It's also a film that really requires multiple viewings to truly appreciate.  Some people have found and may find this film \"boring\", but to quote Harvey Danger \"If you're bored, then you're boring.\"",

Ever hear someone trying to make sense of their life in a coffee shop? Most of those of us for whom words come easily are all too aware of their shortcomings. Composed of letters that are themselves even more abstract than numbers, words can, at best, approximate truth. In the most skilled hands, and by these I refer to Shakespeare, Euripedes, Williams, and arguably less than a handful of others, and in conjunction with acting of the highest calibre, truth can be approached but never apprehended. The truth lives in places free of the constraints of words. Truth lives in the gut and heart, not the mind.Given this, Waking Life's pastiche of dialogue and diatribe quickly wears thin. I closed my eyes early on, closing out the fascinating and intricate \"animation\" on-screen, and heard the words. Shallow they were. Hollow, puffed up. Worth little. This, then, is a cartoon of the highest order. Fascinating visual affect overlaying the most pedestrian of stories. Our feeble attempt to work out with words the significance of life and our little lives.\"Yes, this reviewer is complaining about the way the characters speak, and he sounds very much like on of the characters in this movie.\n\"Waking Life\" is an incredibly real movie. It's more real than any movie I've ever seen. This is not a film that I sat and watched in a theater, but it is something I experienced.I never try to write reviews for anything, because I'm not very elequent when it comes to discussing my own aesthetic perceptions. This movie is even more difficult to review because it's so good, so perfect, so important, so REAL that I can't even use any of those words to describe it.I was actually a little annoyed for the first 20 minutes, and felt like I couldn't get a word in. But eventually I gave up trying to get a word in, and as I paid attention to these people, I realized how confused they were. Notice how the most grating, difficult to follow monolouges are delivered by the most intense, confused people. They have all of these questions and answers (or answers and questions), but they certainly are not enlightened. The film doesn't give us any answers, but shows us an illegible digital clock that makes us realize that we're not really awake.\nIt is if the director took a little piece of the Truth (or God, or Tao, or whatever) and distilled it into movie form.",

The use of irony in the film (I am not sure what else it could be called without a loss of accuracy in meaning or melodrama) is beautifully-integrated: a man setting himself on fire in a relatively secluded street to demonstrate his lack of voice, a chimpanzee teaching a class regarding evolution (with a film showing humans), and a man denouncing propaganda from his vehicle through a loudspeaker, 1984-style.A wonderfully intricate movie; definitely recommended.",

I could go to a coffee shop and overhear pseudo-intellectuals say what this movie is saying for free, and probably in greater detail.

Just for the record.  The film was shot on Digital Video and then animated by several different animators.  It was the actors/players themselves who were talking.  Some of the players were not actors, but friends of Linklater's voicing their own opinions or speaking on topics important to them.All of the well written criticism about this movie seems to be stemming from one of several observations.1.  The film doesn't take a stand.  It merely shows a bunch of people throwing around their ideas.Quite frankly, this is one of my main criticisms of American Films, that they feel they HAVE to take a stand.  I don't like being beaten over the head by some schmoe who only knows how to use a camera and feels that he has a point.  Watch some prewar (WWII) french films or Italian neorealist flicks, or anything by Jane Campion for that matter and see what I mean.2.  The film is Philosophy 101.When taken piece by piece, I would agree that none of the theories are particularly groundbreaking.  I happen to think that this film shows a snapshot of our collective experiences of \"Waking Life\" as a human.I'm not a philosopher, but this film seemed to me to be extrememly representative of many of Hoffstadter, Dawkins, and Dennett's current theories on Human Consciousness.\nDefinitely worth the ticket",

However, after the first few characters explain their own philosophical perspectives, which are rather heavy-duty, it gets going a bit and keeps you interested.Philosophical conversations on dreams, what it means to be human, the nature of cinema and on many other metaphysical, spiritual and social issues leave you with a mind full of ideas and thoughts.  It is brainfood with a beautifully visualized style.I watched Star Wars Episode 2, straight after this and the contrast could not be greater - this is a brilliantly written, intelligent and original film; Star Wars is a dull rehash of other films, painted over with special effects and including one of the all-time worst scripts.",

The artistic surface of the constantly moving animations embedded in a calmly flowing plot of everyday life conversations and philosophical insights is simply to demanding for the masses. My first impression of the images was one of \"sea sickness\". There is (at first sight) no point to hold on to. Everything is moving and floating around. The patterns and colours are changing so rapidly that your eyes can hardly follow, yet it is hard to ignore the simple beauty of the \"overcoloured\" images. In contrast to that the plot suggests calmness and coolness of the ever searching characters that change from episode to episode... and slowly a fixed point (in the story) crystallises: the boy that can't let go, the \"hero\" to identify with, the dreamer in the dream, the one which the viewer will follow to the end of the story - the final awakening. The message (imho) of this movie is to see the world as it really is, to let go of fixed opinions, to stop dreaming and to wake up in every moment of your life and start living.",

Theories of living, anger, hate, existentialism and alienation are delivered through the unlikely and unique animation montages.Bottom line:  If your idea of entertainment starts with T&A and ends with an explosion sequence---definitely wrong movie.   If your idea of entertainment includes probing the popular understanding of life--- \"Waking Life\" attempts to explore a new, subversive aesthetic sensibility. Avant-pop drawing on the forms, slogans, characters, and narrative archetypes of our multidimensional, information-dense culture.",

            "content": "\"Waking Life\", while not a film for everyone, has to be one of best,most ground-breaking films of the past few years.It may drive some people away because of its lack of a coherentstory, but if you can put aside your expectations of what a film\"should be\", you may realize its complexity and depth. Yes, the filmis all talking, but the movie stays engaging because theconversations the characters have cover such a broad range ofhuman emotions and current world issues. From realism to theabsurdity, from politics to film theory, from the act of living to the actof dying - this film covers it all. And it will take many, many viewingsin order to absorb everything it has to say.What really makes the film an innovation is the style of animation.It is a technique called \"rotoscoping\", where they take videofootage and animate over it. Not only is this animation stylebeautiful to look at, but it has everything to do with the meaning ofthe film. The movie centers around a character who is never quitesure whether he is awake or dreaming. The animation accentuates this by creating a world which is both real (the real lifeactors and settings caught on video) and fantasy (the animationdrawn over them). The meshing of reality and fantasy complements the overall mission of the film, which is to explorethe interaction between the two.\"Waking Life\" asks a lot of questions, but only scratches thesurface as to what the answers might be. This is what makes it sogreat. Most films try to hand you a moral on a silver platter. Butreally, life has no easy answers and this movie challenges you tofind your own.\"Waking Life\" is a truly one-of-a-kind work of film art.",

There were times to feel the characters, to think about life, to trip in a looser context. It is full of meanings but it still refers to developing minds. Something like the bible, easy but profound. I think that this is the only debatable angle of the movie, but talking from an emerging self awakening, the movie proves that can help people through provoking them to knowledge and self enlightenment.This was my first review . . . a great movie!",

In it he addresses the nature of film, using the ideas of Bazin as a springboard, butsimultaneously he is in a film within the movie being watched by the maincharacter.

If you thought the movie to be boring then I think the concept of it might be to high for you, and I recommend something else.The basic idea for those who are interested is; Wiley Wiggins (main character) is struck by a car after coming into town. This causes Wiley to fall into a sleep. The rest of the movie takes place in Wiley's lucid dreams. He knows he is dreaming and in fact has woken up. But only into another dream. He talks to many people about the idea's of dreams and of life. Hence Waking Life.I highly recommend this film to anyone.",

When a movie has the simple intention of being art, in its purest form, it is a reason to celebrate.A meditative study on dreams, death, existence, reality, and life itself, it is a 100 minute philosophical cliff-note. While it doesn't have the time, nor the inclination, to delve into the depths of the subjects it introduces, the very fact that it introduces them into the consciousness of any audience member willing to listen, elevates this from being, \"just another movie\", to art, art as it should always strive to be; a means to elevate the mind of the viewer, and a means to comment on the very things that make us human.Wonderfully animated through a new computer-based rotoscoping process, it allows for the many animators involved to express themselves as artists, as well as pushing the movie forward. The process truly does a wonderful job of mimicking dream imagery as best as can be done in the waking world, what with the constantly shifting styles, and the floating, surreal feel of the \"reality\" of the movie. I was just as enthralled with the visual palette as I was with the spoken one.Like Linklater's \"Slacker\", it does not have a conventional narrative structure, which will turn some viewers off, but in a movie such as this, a conventional structure is unnecessary, and, honestly, would have cheapened the material. That isn't to say that it is without story, far from it, what we are watching is the main character's journey of discovery, his being prepared. Prepared for what? That's for the viewer to decide.I would recommend this whole heartedly to anyone with the patience and desire to be enlightened as well as entertained. It is not for everyone. It is not for the passive viewer who wants their entertainment laid out for them so that thinking is not required. You HAVE to pay attention. You HAVE to listen. If you just let the words being spoken flow past you without a thought, you will be cheating yourself. Open your mind, and give this one a chance.",

The technique of animation employed in this movie combines the artists' designs with a cast of real-life actors.

This technique allowed the ideas of this film come alive in an entirely unique and charming manner.

The movie was first filmed and edited, and then the animators went over the picture, frame by frame, and redrew everything. This gave it a more natural movement that most animated films miss out on without this technique. Each scene was drawn by a new artist. I disliked some of the artists' styles, but the way the movie jumped from scene to scene so quickly kept me interested. The fact that the movie was filmed by a hand-held camera kind of drove me crazy because the animation seemed a bit TOO floaty.

All you people that feel as a neo-human, that feel free, that are looking for an excuse to love, to believe in good things and moral and all in all for people that do not take things for granted and pose a question mark before every single object or situation they encounter, yes all of them should own a copy of this masterpiece.

I'll admit openly that you have to pay attention to follow this story but it's worth it once it all clicks. As for rotoscoping, the most notable use of it I can site would be in Star Wars. How did they create glowing light sabres in the late 70's? Mark Hamill and David Prowse (Darth Vader) were filmed fighting with broomsticks and then the FILM was PAINTED OVER. Waking Life is a full length feature film done entirely in this technique. If you have any interest in cinema, watch this film.

            "content": "Alright. First of all, yes it's a cartoon, but if you're into art at all, this movie's a visual delight, and quite inspirational as well. Apparently, the director had the scenes filmed on digital camera (so the characters are all real people), and then had it \"painted over\" with computer generated animation. So it's not just a \"cartoon.\" It's just incredible.Basically, the movie consists of the main character's encounters with various people who all have something to say about their take on the idea of Life and existence. The idea of existentialism is heavy throughout, and there is some really great food for thought. It somehow manages this without being what some might call a \"pretentious\" movie.It's a little hard to really ingest everything that's brought to light the first time around. I mean the visuals are overwhelming, and so is the material. I've seen it a couple times now, and I still can't get over what pure genius this movie is. Kudos to Director Richard Linklater, and all the staff.. Beautiful.",

There is no stationary thing in the scenes it's just moving objects with complicated-looking, shallow-nature monologues or dialogues: all are micro-lecturers to introduce an idea, theory, philosophy etc. It's an attempt to summarize all the debates around the world in religion, spirituality, consciousnesses, humanity, free-will, society, laws, freedom, morality etc in a messy complex medicine. The movie is dreams in dreams and if you have a full stomach like what I had, it will be a vomit time in the middle of it. Don't recommend it if you are not passionate about making yourself sick (mentally and physically) !",

            "content": "For my English class we watched this movie, \"Waking Life.\" We never finished it but I am going to comment on what I was able to see; which was probably the first 25 minutes of it. The first part of the movie that appealed to me was the animation. I think that this type of animation was really cool. It was not a cartoon animation completely but had parts that were very similar. I found this type of animation very interesting. This type of animation was very affective when showing the impact of a conversation. When the two people in the beginning are talking about a tiger I liked how the background got orange for a minute to impact the conversation about the tiger that they were having. When the man in the movie was having the dream in the beginning when he woke up and the screen showed white to break up his dream from the real world, I liked that part especially. I think these film tactics are good use of color and transitioning from one scene to the next. Lastly, from the animation stand point I really liked the interesting boat car that the man in the beginning drove. It was very unusual, as was the situation that the car put the man in. My favorite analogy from the movie was the crayon image. I think it is true that everyone is born with different talents, \"crayons,\" but that it is up to oneself to utilize them and make a difference. I also like the quote, \"our decision who we are.\" I am a person that believes that it is up to oneself to make the difference. I think that in order to get something done one needs to be proactive and not just sit around waiting for something to happen. Another quote from the movie that displays this idea of making your life what you want it to be is, \"your life is yours to create.\" I think that throughout the movie the topics that are discussed are topics that are the ones that really pull a person's character out of them. People always say that politics and religion draw people's true character out of them. In this movie it really touches on a person's thoughts on these topics. I thought the comment on the voting and how it is really for one puppet or another was an interesting thought, and at sometimes seems all too true. Well this is all I have so far, but like I said, I haven't seen the whole movie yet. I do plan on watching the rest. After I have done that then maybe i'll post again on my thoughts of the ending! :)",

            "content": "Last week I participated in viewing a portion of this movie in my English class. I would like to express my opinion about this segment of the film.The following quotes were displayed and are indeed inspiring: This is what I've seen, and in summary I think that these people are spending a lot of time talking about the sense of life and problems of the reality of life and the desirable features of life.At some point in the film, someone committed suicide which is arguably one way to give up on life and quit searching for improvements in life, ending the search for the truth in life. It may be true that we will all die someday, but since we have been given life, we should make the best of it. After all, there are others that may have it worse off than us, and who will be around to comfort them? Instead of giving up on life, I would like everyone to wake up and do something to improve life in general, so our life will reach new evolution that would hold the following components, such as truth, loyalty, freedom and love.On the issue of \"loosing virtue in life\", you should remember \"your life is yours to create\". This strengthens the above statement, that we should do something each day to have joy instead of trying to someday reach a state of joy. As someone once said, \"Happiness is not a destination; it is a way of traveling\". So, I urge you to do something productive everyday, be happy and remember that only creation should come from frustration.",

            "content": "In my English class, I recently viewed a portion of this film, Waking Life. The most obvious difference between it and other movies I noticed was the way it was animated. The lines and shapes were constantly changing and shifting. In one of the first couple of conversations, the girl that the main character talks to even has shifting hair. When the girl talks about geometric shapes (I think), the hair at the side of her head turns into geometric shapes. I'm not sure exactly what she talks about, but it's something like that. Anyway, I also noticed people's eyes changing color, and many other things. I think that this contributes to the over all feeling you get watching this movie, making it seem like a dream. Another thing that does this is the cross between animation and live action. I loved the fact that you couldn't tell sometimes whether it was animation or real. This gave it a huge feeling of the whole thing being a dream. I know that it wouldn't have been as good or interesting if there weren't this neat type of animation.Another thing I really enjoyed about this movie was the lack of plot. The whole portion of the movie I viewed was just a guy going around and listening to people talk about what they think. I thought this was a very interesting way to get these ideas across. This makes the whole movie very original (though it is definitely not the only thing that makes it unique). The one part that stands out in my mind is the conversation between the two people lying in bed. It is singled out to me because it was the only conversation I saw that the main character wasn't involved in. Well, he wasn't really involved in the other conversations, but he was present. I don't recall seeing him in this particular scene at all. It also stands out to me because of what they talk about. I just thought the concept of living a whole life that literally is a 10 second flash of life from an older person is neat. It made me think about our life being an infinitely long 10-second span. This is another thing that I like about this movie, is that it makes you think about what you hear. I don't like it when you can see a movie and forget about it a second later. To be good, it has to leave an impression on you, and make you think. This movie, even though I only saw a small portion of it, definitely did that.",

            "content": "Unfortunately, I was only able to see the first twenty five minutes of this movie and from only five minutes, I think it is a masterpiece of thought. Within this twenty five minutes of film, this different cartoon causes the brains of it's viewers to really think about society and the world. As far as the story line and material is concerned, I really like the extremely high level of thought that everything in this film possess. Starting off, a young man that has no direction just goes with the flow of things, not knowing what is going to happen and where he will end up. As events occur, a path is being set before this young man because he has options and he has choices. All these in depth thought processes are sparked up by a man who is driving a boat on wheels that offers this young man a ride. This vehicle is amphibious, can go on land and water, which is a metaphor representing that there is no roads or paths, that people can go anywhere at anytime. The captain or driver talks and talks to the young man about society, directions in life, and the connections that one thing has to another. In following scenes, this young man then is found in a class room and then spends a great deal of time talking to an older man, possibly a professor, again about life, society, history and the future of the world. As a whole, I feel that one message is for younger people to listen to the elder, wiser and more experienced and to make choices about where to go in life based on what they have learned from those before them. I also liked how at times the cartoons would appear to be real people and images, only for a brief moment, then switch back to the animation appearance. I look forward to seeing the rest of the movie which I assume will be very exciting and thought provoking!",

            "content": "Hello, I am writing a post on this website for an English class I am in right now. In this class we watched the first twenty or so minutes of the movie. From what I saw I found this movie to be different. The first and most obvious thing that is different is the look of the film. The film almost seems animated. It is as if they drew lines and colors over the actors on the screen. I thought this had a very cool effect on the movie. The second thing that is odd about the movie is it jumps around all over the place. I mean it starts out with two kids playing with that piece of paper and then it jumps to an orchestra practice. From there it goes to the young man getting off the train. I do not know if the young man is supposed to be the boy in the first scene or what. Then the young man hitches a ride with a man in a car in the shape of a boat. The young man from the train seems as though he doesn't care where he goes. Then he is dropped off and gets hit by a car. You don't know if he dies because the next scene shows him getting out of bed. This is then followed by the young man meeting several different people. Each person he meets has something different to tell him. This is about where we stopped the movie. What I think the movie is about is life lessons. This is only my opinion from about the first twenty minutes. I think the small boy in the first scene is the young man from the train. The paper he was playing with was like his destiny. Each time he picked something from the paper it represented a person he met. Each person or selection had a different effect. I have no idea if this is right. It is only my opinion. What do other people think? From the first twenty minutes I saw I thought the movie was interesting. I definitely am thinking about going out and finishing watching it. I wish I could have seen more. What is your opinion on what the movie is about? What do you think of mine?",

When this movie started I didn't really know what to think but I found myself wanting to know more and trying to connect everything as it was coming to us, the viewers. In this movie there were two issues that really stuck in my head after watching a small 20 minute clip, destiny and politics. With each different person there seemed to be a road or path laid out by destiny and even though your destiny was laid there for you, you were told that you had the ability to change any one part of that destiny. This kind of made me think that it would be possible for any one to do this at any given time. Destiny is not assigned but made, it's up to you to take the path laid for you or you could create your own. The other issue that caught my attention was that of politics. There were so many different times that the characters in the movie would discus, in a very nonchalant way, this very broad topic. Like with destiny and the paths that you take, politics have different paths and different ways of discussing it. In this movie there is a very subtle way the approach it and then there are very harsh and specific ways that they were discussed. There was one specific part and I was really shocked at the outcome because for one I was not expecting it and two the topic was being to calmly discuss that what happened threw my guard off. I was only able to watch a small 20 minute section, like I said before, but that short section of this movie caught my attention and made me wonder if I would still feel the same if I saw the entire thing.",

Even through all of the confusion i enjoyed this movie.

I didn't quite understand the plot of the movie but there were a lot of metaphors about like being used. I would like to finish this movie i think it would give me a better idea of what the movie is about.

Even in the short time I had to view it, my attention was captivated. It has been mentioned by others, especially those who watched it at the same time that I did, that the graphics were very interesting and worthy of paying attention to. I loved how the movie was drawn like a cartoon, but everything seemed so life like. While watching it, one might forget: are the events that are happening real or made up? I realize that it is a stretch, but Waking Life reminds me a little of movies like Toy Story. Though the animation technique used was quite different, in both cases everything looked so lifelike and was modeled after real things unlike a cartoon such as the Flintstones. During the movie an idea was brought up that has always been so interesting to me. At one point the characters were discussing how words are just symbols. For example, what do love or frustration really mean? It is so cool to think that no one can really give them a definition. Whenever someone asks \"what is love?\" an answer is almost impossible to come up with. It means something so different to each person and, even if we do think we know what love is, finding words to describe it can seem like the hardest thing in the world to do. Questions like this have become even more compelling to me as I have seen them in the real world or learned about them in classes. For example, I have taken Spanish classes since my freshman year of high school. One of the difficulties I have come across in my quest to become bilingual is that certain words or phrases simply do not translate well between two languages. At times it can be frustrating because you want to be able to convey the correct meaning, but usually I think it is more fascinating to see the subtle changes between languages. One example of this that I think of right away is the Spanish phrase \"buen provecho.\" When I went to Puerto Rico last year everyone would say this at meal times, but it is hard to explain to someone who only speaks English. I guess it would be close to the French phrase \"bon appetite\" but not exactly. Right now is an instance where it is frustrating to not be able to tell you exactly what I mean, but I wish I could because the phrase is so cool. Another time that I have seen this as I have tried to learn Spanish is with songs. Music is something that is full of emotions no matter what language one speaks. Whenever I have tried to explain to someone what the lyrics of a Spanish song mean, it just comes out not sounding as good as it did in its natural state. This is because so much is lost in translation.",

            "content": "Walking Life\u0085Although I only saw part of this movie, I thought it was very interesting. This was a type of movie one could think of in many aspects. The animation was awesome. It looked so real. It really caught my attention and made me want to watch more. I would like to express my thoughts towards some of the sayings and/or images I thought were interesting enough to note: 1.Dream is destiny I looked up the term \"destiny\" in Microsoft Office Word 2003. There were three parts to defining this term. I believe one of these pertained to this thought more: \"the inner purpose of a life that can be discovered and realized.\" I believe when one dreams, anything is possible. Dreaming of the impossible can lead to discoveries. Perhaps the main character of \"Walking Life\" is trying to find destiny by dreaming\u0085 dream is destiny! 2.Crayons- it's what you do with the colors This saying is so true! It is not really how you use the crayon, but how you express yourself by the colors. I think this applies to the movie. The colors in this case are all of the little motions and expressive animation (both drawn and spoken).3.\"Your life is for you to create\" \u0096professor Obviously\u0085 This seems almost ridiculous in a way, but so many people seem to lead their lives in other's footsteps or in the \"wants\" of others. This ties in with the previous fragment about the crayons and the color. One creates their life by using their own colors and no one else's.4.\"\u0085words are dead\u0085\" \u0096counselor (female) At times words are dead. When nothing else can be said or when too much has already been said, words can be considered dead. One thing this makes me think of are \"sorrys\" or apologies. Sometimes apologies are in a sense overdone and the words become gibberish or dead. This is also much like \"why is writing (s)welles.\" Once one has gone on and on about a certain topic ((s)welle), the words begin to die and the reader eventually dies off too (is not interested).5.\"\u0085man needs chaos...\" \u0096friend Without chaos, the world would be a great place. But without one thing, in this case that occurs almost everyday, everything could change. Chaos is a normal state. Confusion is normal. I think many things would never get done if it was not for chaos. Oh yeah, I definitely did not like the fire!6.Reincarnation/collective memory- couple in bed I was not too sure where this conversation was going, but it seemed interesting. I noticed myself trying to understand what these two were talking about. Their thoughts were intriguing. I think this may have been where we stopped watching it. We should watch the rest! ----- There were a couple parts of the animation where I noticed the character's looks changed, but was not sure of the reasoning\u00851.The counselor's hair makes shapes while she talks\u0085 While the woman counselor was talking, here hair would move certain ways. I'm assuming it was possibly to make it seem more realistic. Anyway, her hair made shapes. Every few seconds it would change and different geometric shapes would appear. I know this does not seem too important, but maybe there is meaning behind it.2.Other counselor (male) talking about evolution of individuals while he himself is changing\u0085 Then, the other counselor was talking about evolution of individuals to the main character. I though it was a bit funny because he was changing; he was developing different characteristics. Development is much like evolution. I thought this could have been a form of symbolism. To tell you the truth though, I was too busy watching his head expand and then shrink\u0085I really did not pay much attention to what he said; other than it was about evolution of individuals.",

First thing that really attracted me to this movie was the animation. Animated characters are always a good way to make people pay attention to the message that is being displayed along with simply being entertaining. However these different characters were so real that is seemed as if it were cartoons coming to life with real problems and ideology. My favorite part of the movie which is the same part that stuck out in my head the most is the part where a three guys were riding in the car and the driver goes on and on talking about random but meaningful things and then he says this phrase which really caught my attention. The phrase went something like, \"I doesn't matter if you have a 8- count or 16- count of crayons, what matters is what you do with the colors.\" This statement is so true because it pertains to almost everything in life, in all that you do, wherever you are. So many people are interested in the quantity of things when it is the quality that counts. Like those who write papers for their classes and think that the teachers are interested in some long drawn out paper or answer. When what they really want is a simple answer that shows exactly how much you know without the complications of some long unnecessary explanation. Or those who go out and do a ton of volunteer work with little to no effort compared to the one who does one volunteer activity and throws all of his hard work, effort, and determination into it. What good is a raw steak dinner if you have a fully prepared juicy cheeseburger meal? I know it sounds funny but it's true. The world and especially America have been so overwhelmed with trying to get more and more of the quantity of things that forget about the quality of things, like LIFE! This example was a very good phrase for defending the title of the movie. Other quotes did the same as well. They displayed their intentions in showing what Waking Life actually means. The scenes in this movie took many different approaches to explaining the importance of life and what it means. This would be a very educational movie to recommend to others.",

The picture looked like it was alter with a water color effect. The picture was often wobbly as if it might have been shot underwater. I thought it was kind of cool that some guy's car actually looked like a boat. I notice that there was a big focus on this kid just wandering around from place to place but they never really explained why he was doing this. I would how I would find out if I saw the rest of this film. Also, the people the kid went to see were always giving him a theory or some kind of explanation to something. I thought it was weird when the kid started floating. I did not really understand why this happened. I though it was also weird when some guy that was talking to the kid all the sudden pours gasoline all over himself and then lit a match and set himself on fire. Then the film changes from the kid to a couple lying in bed and talking about reincarnation.I think I would have liked to finish this film. I believe it would give me a better idea what the message of the film is. I liked the visual effects that were put into this film; it makes the film different from any other film that I have ever seen. In my opinion, I think that the visual effects in the movie will be significant throughout it. I would like to see then rest of the film to see if the kid actually has a purpose. I would like to see where he ends up in the end as well. I think it might be significant that the couples in bed were discussing life and they also could be just waking from a nap. (Waking Life) I was also wondering if the visual effects for this movie were made from a program like Photoshop. I did find a couple of setting that alters pictures to make them look like watercolors like in the movie. In conclusion, I feel I need to view the rest of this film so I can actually know if my opinions were accurate. I was also interested in seeing how the film played out and if the visual effects had something important to do with the plot.",
