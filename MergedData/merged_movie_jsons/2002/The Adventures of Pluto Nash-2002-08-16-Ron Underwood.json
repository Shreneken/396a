            "content": "3.7. A 3.7 out of 10. As I sit here, writing this review, this film has a user-average rating of 3.7 out of 10. I'm going out on a limb here, and assume that there are many people who blindly voted low scores to bring down the rating, based solely on the negative publicity. Because, I honestly can't believe that they all witnessed the same film I did. (Not to mention, mass negative voting from people who haven't seen the film is a problem here for movies with hype or notoriety.)I knew the story, I heard about it all. The film was shelved for two years, didn't get much publicity, and was released August of 2002. Releasing a major comedy with a huge budget 2 years after completion, with little publicity on almost the exact date of the 1-year anniversary of one of the biggest tragedies to ever hit the US... Seriously, did the studio even think when they tried to push this film out? I can only assume not. Critics crucified it. Audiences ignored it. It was a flop.I went along, blindly following the notion that because it flopped, it sucked. (Although, I have found out that many great films flopped, among them \"It's a Wonderful Life.\") Finally a few months ago, a friend of mine said: \"Hey Adam, let's watch 'Pluto Nash'! It's on NetFlix!\" I scoffed, but after he persisted, I agreed.I'm glad I did.\"Pluto Nash\" was refreshingly entertaining, and in no way was it the abysmal slight against cinema I had been told it was.The film centers on Pluto Nash (Eddie Murphy in a fun performance), his sidekick robot Bruno (Randy Quaid in perhaps my favorite performance in the film) and Dina Lake (the astonishingly beautiful Rosario Dawson), with numerous other actors in supporting roles. Nash is the owner the nightclub \"Club Nash\", on the moon, some time in the future. He bought the club to save the life of a friend (Jay Mohr), who has since become a famous \"singer\" in a snazzy upscale part of the moon, leaving Nash behind. Dina arrives, hoping to work for Nash in order to earn money to buy her way back to Earth.Soon, henchmen sent by the mysterious Rex Crater arrive, interested in buying Nash's club. When Nash turns them down, they destroy the place. Nash, Dina and Bruno vow to discover who this Rex Carter is, and stop him.And so begins this fun action/comedy/sci-fi feature. In all honesty, the story is clich\u00e9, but it actually works quite well. This isn't supposed to be a revolutionary masterpiece, it's meant to be a fun good-guys-VS-bad-guys-buddy-movie type film, only set on the moon in the future. The characters are quite endearing and likable as well. They feel like people you'd want to hang out with.The special effects (which were unfairly criticized at the time) are surprisingly good, considering they were from 2000 (remember, the film was finished but shelved for two years), and the direction of Ron Underwood is quite nice. Visually, the film is a treat.The cast works. Murphy, Dawson and Quaid are all great in their roles, and supporting characters are played very well by some big names, such as Peter Boyle, Pam Greir, Burt Young and even a cameo by Alec Baldwin.The music is fun, the editing is great, the set design is exquisite, the acting is generally very good, the direction is fantastic, the story is decent enough. I really can't say much. The craftsmanship is very competent. It's not a bad film by any stretch of the imagination from any conceivable way you look at it. Is it a particularly strong film? No. But is it a halfway decent film with some laughs and some heart? Yes, it is most definitely. I also admire the fact that this film isn't ashamed of being light-hearted and positive. A lot of films (especially these days) try to be dark and gritty. It's nice to see just a positive, fun film.I honestly can't understand how this was so hated by critics upon release, and so ignored by the general public. It's a very fun movie, and I had a blast watching it. I will gladly be buying this flick sometime soon, and sharing it with others, so they can finally see this treat they missed out on.I give \"The Adventures of Pluto Nash\" a good 7 out of 10. It's lighthearted fun.",

But it's still Eddie Murphy being funny and filled with cute little moments.I'm not sure why this film attracts so much hate, it doesn't bother doing anything so terrible that it deserves the vitriol level of criticism that seems to be thrown at it.It's at worst a movie that's easy to classify as \"average\", but personally I actually really enjoy this film. It's a non offensive, straight forward sci-fi comedy that doesn't require any deeper understanding or intellectual delving.There's no deeper meaning here than some funny people having an adventure on a future moon city. You could do a lot worse with your time than to sit back, turn off your brain for an hour and just enjoy the show.Honestly this is one of my go to movies for multitasking, something funny on in the background that doesn't require my 100% attention to still make me laugh while I'm doing other things. And it ends up getting watched more often than some of the \"better\" movies that I would rate at 10 simply because those are often a chore to watch and require actually thinking to understand them.Yes if you understood that correctly: I do enjoy a deeper movie and would rate them higher, but it's also not what I would typically grab from day to day when I just want to laugh while getting through the grind: The Adventures of Pluto Nash \"is\".",

It's not a great movie, but it is imaginative, clever, technically head and shoulders better than most sci fi, has great CGI. The set design was on par with Total Recall.I'm not connecting with the criticisms at all. I can see it not winning awards. I cannot see it garnering the universal criticism it did.Someone called the action scenes weak and wooden. For 1/6 g? Have you seen footage of the astronauts walking on the moon? I wouldn't even call the plot weak. The twist ending was genuinely surprising, certainly as good as Freejack.In fact, the thing that bugged me the most seemed to be among many people's favorite. I thought Randy Quaid's libidinous android felt unrealistic, and marred the overall emphasis on a possible future. Imagine Marvin the paranoid robot taking Data's place. A bit hard to take seriously, no?I'm glad I took the minor risk and made the purchase. I will keep the DVD and watch it again occasionally.",

            "content": "\"The Adventures of Pluto Nash\" has the same type of pacing, wit, slapstick, and raging sidesplitting comedy- and and even bits of Pseudoscience- as the Howard Hawks 1938 and also-not appreciated-in-its-time \"Bringing Up Baby\". Perhaps not classic material as the latter, but surely contains all the elements that made Bringing up Baby the unstoppable string of events it is - And Pluto Nash certainly is a nonstop romp through a fictional future. Some of the gag elements - Including Hilary Clinton's face on a $10,000 dollar Bill... This film has so many details like that, where you just have to accept the incredulity of it all: And although gags like that were used in films like 1990's Total Recall (Mars Today Newspaper rack on Mars) and The 5th Element (Cigarettes that are 3/4 butt with a small amount of tobacco), the gags do not take over the scenes, they just happen to be there just to add to the general insanity.Not being familiar with Director Ron Underwood other than 1990's \"Tremors\" I watched this because I had to see Eddie Murphy working with Randy Quaid, who also has a great sense of comedy (re: 1996's \"Independence Day\"). Underwood has an impressive list of works including \"City Slickers\" and \"Mighty Joe Young\". John Powell did the soundtrack and it smacks of some of his other films, blending the pop music of the soundtrack with his strains of heavy melodic beat.Cameos by the great Pam Grier, Alec Baldwin, Illeana Douglas, John Cleese, James Rebhorn as a crook and even other classics like Burt Young and Peter Boyle... There is simply a lot of good talent in this film, Rosario Dawson, Joe Joe Pantoliano, Jay Mohr, and Luiz Guzman.I was surprised how much I enjoyed this, it is classic comedy, not modern comedy- You don't have to think, the jokes are hand delivered by Murphy and Quaid through most of the film, with Quaid almost stealing the whole film and Pantoliano a close second. Eddie is simply Eddie, and can make you laugh just by looking at you, nobody had to work to be funny, it just is. The other players toss in their bit on cue. It is simply set in a futuristic setting, and due to that, the gags are unique and hilarious.If only they could film on location in \"Little America\" on the moon, perhaps in 2087, they will be able to do that.",

My feelings after catching this movie on HBO are clear, don't necessarily base all of your decisions to watch a movie or not on highly publicized reviews. The fact is, that I enjoyed this movie. I thought that the cast was attractive and talented; and that there were some credible laughs. But most of all, I thoroughly enjoyed the way the movie looked and how it was filmed. This film was simply not as bad as the critics said it was. It is possible that because the critics criticized the movie so much, that when I finally saw the movie, and was not repulsed by it, that I began to relax and enjoy it. I think that many of the critics were expecting a Beverly Hills Cop-type laugh fest, but that is not a comedy that's really an action-drama with a few laughs. This is strictly a sci-fi comedy, as such, it does not take itself seriously; and neither should you if you decide to watch it. Just see if you enjoy it. I sure did.",

Along with Bruno and Dina, Pluto visits a seedy motel, his secret hide out and the casino of the most powerful man on the moon searching for the evil doer.But there are inclinations that the destruction of his club may have been his own fault...The first thing you need to know about this film is that most of the haters have just jumped on the bandwagon and slated this movie without actually seeing it. Secondly, the film isn't half bad, yes it's a flop and makes no sense whatsoever, but its fun to see such an unmitigated disaster that looks so good.Murphy is the intergalactic Axel Foley, the Chandler Jarrel of space, Prince Akeem of the moon. Basically he playing the same wisecracking character he always has done, and it still works, for some people. It works for me still because I know that he changed his views after the risible Harlem Nights and stopped being such an ego maniac, and made films that were not just for him. The cast are fine, especially Quaid and Dawson, and although there is nothing really funny to speak of, its entertaining and has a good score, and reasonable set pieces.The final act is completely bonkers, and the overall effect is like spending time with someone who is very attractive but uneducated. Nice to look at, but you wouldn't want to spend any more time with them.",

The special effects are top class and the CGI workers deserve kudos.  Sure the plot was holywood boiler plate but it really surpassed Total Recall and Mr. Murphy was still able to project his exceptional talent and gift for dramatic comedy.  Why didn't Warner Bros. plug this better?  Why the release delay?  Obviously putting it on DVD/VHS there was somebody with brains, sense, and guts to know it had quality.

The plot was fun and interesting, and I really liked the way the movie had an atmosphere that melded the future with the past.  Notice in particular the cool looking vehicles.  It was a little like Total Recall, and also like The Fifth Element, but this doesn't mean it stole from either.  It was quite original I think.  I recommend this movie, it is fun and exciting.  Just don't expect a total comedy and lots of dirty jokes or you will be disappointed.  Expect some good science fiction, with some genuinely funny moments.  I enjoyed this movie a lot.

The next day I had conveniently a couple of hours to kill at home, so I thought I might as well check whether Pluto Nash was just bad or a real turkey.Much to my surprise I sat through the entire movie mildly entertained. Certainly anyone expecting a movie where Eddie Murphy makes faces, laughs like a horse and tells immature vulgar jokes is indeed in for a sore disappointment, as this film gracefully lacks all those clich\u00e9s. In fact all kind of humour is scarce, jokes are few and far between and -- frankly -- vacuous at best. However, The Adventures of Pluto Nash is not half-bad as a sci-fi adventure. Effects are quite nice, and although the script does not blow one's mind with innovativeness, it keeps the story flowing fluently with no dead moments. 7/10.",

Randy Quaid was funny and annoying at the same time. Also had a really funny cameo of Pam Greir as Eddie's mom. A nice, solid movie. Not perfect by any means with lots of science mistakes but then Hollywood does that a lot anyway.

            "content": "This is just another example of the continuing downward spiral of Eddie Murphy's once exciting career. Murphy will always have scripts handed to him and he'll always be working in films but the once edgy comedian has lost his edge a long time ago. This story takes place in the future where Earth has populated the Moon and a former smuggler named Pluto Nash (Murphy) takes over a nightclub from a friend and Nash makes it a big success and moneymaker. A young woman and aspiring singer named Dina Lake (Rosario Dawson) asks for a job but all Nash gives her is the opportunity to waitress. Some mobsters have been buying up the local business's and they want Nash's club but he won't sell. So they blow the place up and try to kill him but Nash, Dina and a robot named Bruno (Randy Quaid) escape and the mobsters try and find him. This film was directed by Ron Underwood who is usually reliable with lightweight comedy like this but this film fails from the outset. The special effects are adequate but not overly impressive. Many of the scenes are clearly filmed on a soundstage and in one shot Underwood resorts to actors being hoisted by wires for the gravity effect. Didn't they stop doing that in the 60's? And poor Randy Quaid has to play a horny and overly sensitive robot. Were we really suppose to find it amusing that he tries to get it on with other robots? But the big flaw comes from Murphy himself. This once exciting comedian use to be so reliable for edgy performances but here he plays his character totally straight. As you watch this you keep waiting for Murphy to say something witty and off the cuff but it never happens. It looks like Murphy has decided to try and be an action star or be the romantic lead. Murphy has become boring to watch and its sad to watch his films now. Pam Grier pops up as Murphy's mother but she has nothing to do. She has maybe two scenes and then she runs off (Literally). This film wastes opportunities and the script has nothing new to offer. Along with Murphy's boring and drab performance this film was dead on arrival!",

Sure, The Adventures of Pluto Nash is a notorious bomb, a devastating box office debacle and a frequently bashed film in general. But guess what? I loved every second of it.Call me a masochist, but sometime during mid to late 2003 I decided to locate and watch all of this decades' biggest cinematic flops \u0096 just to see if they were really that bad, or perhaps they were just poorly released with zero studio back up. After literally puking my guts out upon watching such horrors like Battlefield Earth (ugh) or Gigli (barf), I finally stumbled upon the Summer 2002 misfire that is Eddie Murphy's The Adventures of Pluto Nash. What I feared would become another celluloid travesty at first, slowly turned out to be a fun, campy and harmless sci-fi ride, with neat special f/x, imaginative settings (you can easily notice that someone put a lot of thought into this) and hilarious dialogs all packed into one. So OK, it's hardly a masterpiece, but I oddly found myself watching it again and again, until I finally purchased the damn thing on DVD.The playful plot is set in a future where man settles the moon, there we meet Pluto Nash (Eddie Murphy), a successful night club owner whose club is burnt down in flames. Determined to figure out who's sabotaging his business (and trying to make him take the fall), Nash embarks an across-the-moon adventure with the help of his loyal robot Bruno (Randy Quaid) and female protagonist, Dina (Rosario Dawson) \u0096 only to find out the startling truth behind the lunar mafia forces. Along the way, we also meet some wonderful actors in the likes of John Cleese, (the late) Peter Boyle, Joe Pantoliano, Jay Mohr, Luiz Guzman and others.While you won't find a solid moral value at the end of the road \u0096 this film delivers the goods (and then some) on the pure old-fashioned entertainment field.

John Cleese surprised me actually, I didn't expect to like his character, since I usually don't like him, but was really a great parody of the British butler/chauffeur stereotype. It has a normal amount of Eddie Murphy's typical humor, and that is pretty much what one can expect of any of his films. This is not Eddies best film, but by no means his worst either. Big fans of Eddie Murphy might like this, or people who love sci-fi comedy. As this is *slightly* above average, I gave it a 6/10.",

            "content": "\"The Adventures of Pluto Nash\" was made and shelved for two years....a clear sign that the studio knew they had a box office bomb on their hands. The picture ended up costing $100,000,000 to make and earned back only a little over $11,000,000 worldwide! Because of this, it's the biggest financial disaster in film history. However, after seeing it I realized that is not that bad...even if it is on IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 List...and has a horrid overall score of 3,8!!All this being said, I don't think it's really that bad a film. I think the problem, more than anything else, was that according to some sources, the star, Eddie Murphy, really burned a lot of bridges while making this film...insisting on re-writes and overruling the director repeatedly. And, it seems that the studio got sick of him and the controversy...and word of this leaked out and killed the movie. And, so, as often happens with movies like \"Gigli\", people just start getting on the bandwagon...and heap tons of hate on the picture. However, after seeing it, I thought the movie was actually not bad. Would I pay to go see it? No. Would I pay to rent it? No. But if it was available to see for free on TV, then it's worth seeing.So apart from its horrible reputation, there is one big problme with the film....it's not a comedy. Now perhaps it was intended as one....but there isn't a laugh in the story and it's more an unusual action/adventure film....and I can enjoy it on that level. It also doesn't help that it's very obvious that the film was written and re-written and edited and re-edited...with entire story lines dropped and inexplicably so!The story is set in the future ...a future when the moon is colonized and is a nice place to live...unless you are Pluto. This is because some mobsters want to take his successful nightclub...and they offer him a fraction of what it's worth. He rejects their offer...and they almost immediately blow the place up and try to kill him. Most of the film consists of Pluto and his companions (Rosario Dawson and Randy Quaid...who plays a robot) on the run until the final boss battle.So what did I like about it? Well, the film looks nice for 2002 with decent special effects, costumes and CGI. Compared to today's CGI it's kinda shabby...but that is to be expected after 17 years...technology simply improves and improves over time. Also, the story isn't terrible and the acting is generally decent.So, on whole, the story just isn't funny, parts are obviously missing due to hack editing and re-writes but it looks good and isn't annoying or hellish....like a Bottom 100 film should be. Watchable.By the way, a couple final comments. First, I saw a review which said that they 'laughed from start to finish'. I can only assume this person laughs at ANYTHING....funerals, dramas, Coke commercials, etc....as the film simply isn't funny and doesn't look at all like a comedy. Second, it's become in fashion to hate Eddie Murphy in recent years. While he has had some serious box office stinkers, he's STILL amazingly talented. See \"Dreamgirls\" or \"Bowfinger\" and you'll know what I mean. But I also think he'd benefit from realizing that he alone cannot make a great film...it takes teamwork and a good script.",

It just didn't come together how I would have liked as Pluto was too much of a good guy to be a bad guy.  But, there are certainly much worse movies that have been made like the Italian Job, but watching Pluto Nash, I never wanted to turn it off and watch a blank screen instead.  Critics be damned, this is a good movie to watch on a rainy day.  I wouldn't say to make a sequel, but the premise was solid, the lead actors good, the visuals excellent, but there is just a lack in general direction in the movie, but each scene is fun to watch.

Here's a prime textbook case at how not to do one.It's a comedy with only a microscopic trace of humor, a sci-fi that really could just have easily been set in present-day Earth with no sci-fi elements at all, and an action film that contains only the standard D-grade action story setups and climaxes - and done at a lackadaisical by-the numbers contract-delivery pace.The only element that has the slight bit of remote interest is Randy Quaid as a rather quirky bodyguard robot. At least it's an interesting exercise at how to play a totally fanciful out-of-this world concept with no real-life equivalent. Yeah - the sort of role that your standard modern drama school graduate would be scratching their heads trying to get a grip on; and your academic drama scholar would be tearing their hair out till they looked like Homer Simpson over the fact \"its not the type of role -or story for that matter- that has any credibility or truth to the human experience\" (blah blah!) The fact that he is even a tiny bit watchable in that deserves a bit of a finger-clap - maybe.It could have been so much better - a few puppet-type aliens hanging around, a bit more showing of the light gravity bits, a dig at your serious Arthur C Clarke space drama like MOONDUST - anything at all to make this remotely interesting as a cinema experience - or even a storyline.But what we actually get is the real sort of movie that the conservative critics have accused all summer-style movies of being: brainless formulaic uncreative popcorn entertainment plying to the lowest common denominator that is churned out when the bloated Hollywood studio system is working on autopilot.Actually - this is the movie that makes the normal summer blockbuster movies look like works of literary genius. The critics should have been aware of the old saying: \"Be careful what you wish for - you just might get it.\"",

Eddie Murphy is the title character, a reformed felon operating the most successful club in the \"Little America\" part of the Moon. But after he turns down an offer to sell to a shyster for $10 million, the laser bullets begin flying in his direction. Now he and gal pal Rosario Dawson, along with robot bodyguard Randy Quaid, are on the run.Murphy is generally appealing, but his comic touch just doesn't jive with the sci-fi environment. The plot is at times incoherent and suffers from trying to roll comedy, action and excitement all into one. It's kind of amazing this clunker ever made it beyond the idea phase, particularly with talents such as Murphy and director Ron Underwood (CITY SLICKERS) involved.What does PLUTO NASH have going for it? Though it's supposed to be a comedy, it actually works to some degree as a sci-fi adventure. The massive $100 million budget and futuristic setting make for some interesting visuals. And the picture moves along at a fair pace, with a tidy running time of 95 minutes.For all its flaws, I would not use the term \"boring\" to describe PLUTO NASH. Hollywood has done much better, but it's also done far worse.",

I hate it because it is for me simply not funny and wastes a cast that I think are talented and deserve better.Granted the special effects are elaborate and really quite good and I did like the music, however that is all I have to say that was good. Don't get me wrong I do like Eddie Murphy and his films, Beverly Hills Cop, 48 Hours, Trading Places and Shrek and classics and I liked Coming to America and Bowfinger too.However, when it comes to talking about his films, the only movie of his I consider worse than Pluto Nash is the atrocity that is Norbit. Murphy is a funny and likable actor, but he is very bland here. He does make too much of an effort to stop his character from being bland and ends up over-compensating.The rest of the cast are wasted. John Cleese phones in, Pam Grier is saddled with tired material and sadly it comes through loud and clear in her performance and Rosario Dawson struggles with a clich\u00e9d character in the form of a wannabe singer. Worst of all is Randy Quaid, who not only has some of the film's worst dialogue and gags but his performance is just awful.The cast are not helped by a truly tired and unfunny script, lazy direction from Ron Underwood(was it really the director of Tremors and City Slickers?) and a rushed and predictable story that is filled with poor characters and trite and disconnected scenes.So in conclusion, a very poor film and one of Murphy's worst films. 2/10 Bethany Cox",

With the outlawing of gambling on earth and the potential for it being legalised on the moon, Nash finds his club to be hotly sought after by the local lunar mobsters. His continued refusal to sell though ultimately sees his place bombed and his life under threat. With pretty young waitress Dina and trusty old robot Bruno in tow, Nash tries to stay alive long enough to get to the man responsible for trying to kill him.Two things drew me to this film. One was Rosario Dawson, who is as good an actress as her agent is bad at making decisions on commercial roles \u0096 plus she is stunning which is a big part of it. The second was that this film was slated as one of the worst ever and indeed was once on the bottom 100 on this site. Seeing it for myself I was surprised that it was not that bad but it is no doubt that it is no good at all. The plot is a bit like Total Recall but with the main difference that Total Recall was funnier, more exciting and actually very good. Pluto Nash is full of ideas but it can't do much with any of them other than churn out genre clich\u00e9s. This wouldn't matter too much if it were funny because, after all, this is a film that markets itself as a sci-fi comedy. Sadly though there is not a single laugh in the whole thing and only one single moment that gave me a very slight chuckle.This leaves the plot to do most of the work and, while there is a solid sci-fi plot here mostly the film misjudges it and relies too heavily on coincidence, obvious devices and just plain ol' lapses of logic to make it move forward. The effects are pretty good and I imagine quite expensive. The actors can't do much as they are lost in a comedy without laughs and a sci-fi without a decent plot or flow. Murphy does the usual in these situations and falls back on \"big grin ladies man\" as his character, it is lazy, tired and, without laughs, tiresome. Dawson also just falls back on her looks but in this film that doesn't get her very far \u0096 it is clear she is not even able to try. Quaid is stuck in a poor robot role with one or two bad gags to work with at best. Pantoliano has done better but will survive but I'm sure for all the time they got on this that Guzman, Mohr, Boyle, Grier and Cleese all wish they could have this expunged from their CV's.Pluto Nash is not as bad as everyone says \u0096 it is just that critics love to slate things when they get the chance because so many films are \"OK\" or a \"bit sub-par\". However this is not me defending it because it isn't any good either. As a sci-fi the effects are good but the plot is a mess of clich\u00e9s and badly formed ideas. As a comedy it falls even harder by failing to even have one laugh in the whole damn thing \u0096 not one. No wonder the cast are so at sea in this poor star vehicle. Not the sign of the apocalypse that some suggest but no utter good either.",

It just might be the worst value for money though, with a reported budget topping 100M and a box-office of less than 5 it makes Jonah Hex look like a wise investment.

Pluto Nash wants to be quirky, cool, edgy, funky and hip but is really none of these things.It is 2080 and the Moon has been made hospitable for humans. Pluto Nash (Eddie Murphy) is the guy who everyone on Earth's satellite adores \u2013 except the bad guys who want to force him to sell his bumpin' club to them.After a run in leaves his club a smouldering pile of rubble (like this film) Nash sets off with waitress Dana (Rosario Dawson \u2013 who obviously spent her paycheck on implants after filming ended) and his faithful robot Bruno (Randy Quaid).The trio traverse the moon trying to lay low out of the gunsights of the bad guys while working towards finding who is ultimately responsible for their situation. Along the way they encounter many recognisable faces that add nothing to the film, Jay Mohr, Peter Boyle, Pam Grier, John Cleese and Alec Baldwin among others.I think the aim was for Nash to be cool and likable, Dana the cute love interest and Bruno the comic relief. All fail. As does everything else in the film.But again Pluto Nash is as harmless as it is pointless, unlike the braincell shattering Tank Girl it made me want to sleep more than vomit \u2013 admittedly neither is an endorsement for the film \u2013 but the issue remains how could something cost so much look so ordinary?Now I know how the Miami Heat must feel.A big budget light comedy set on the moon and featuring its own fading star in Murphy was never going to be a big hit. This can't be the fault of director Ron Underwood but the big-wigs who greenlit it and opened the coffers. The absolute ceiling for this film was Demolition Man, itself decidedly average. The floor was Tank Girl, which Pluto managed to avoid but just barely.Now you tell me; is a ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR investment worth making for a film that at best could end up mediocre?Final Rating \u2013 3.5 / 10.

But that said - it's not a top notch movie.I've never been a fan of director Ron Underwood - he might be decent for TV but features aren't his strong side in my opinion. You'll notice best when it comes to the comedy parts (the attempts I should say) and the actions sequences.As for comedy, the directing does nothing to enhance the seemingly weak script. Since comedy seems to be what this movie was to be about and the pace seems intended to be rather fast - maybe they should have gone for a director who could make something out of it? The action sequences are incredibly lame. It resembles grown people playing war without saying \"pow pow\". Here the director's at a loss as well, which shows in sequences as when Randy Quaid's robot character is taking out his two canons for guns. I take it, this is supposed to be a \"cool\" shot but the angle of camera, timing and pace makes it about as cool as when your dad hangs up his coat upon returning home from work.The budget ($100 million allegedly) didn't seem to be a problem and the special effects as well as the sets seem pretty well done, along with a pretty nice cast (even tiny sub-minute parts are mostly done by actors you at least recognize). This must be seen as further critique of the director, since he seemed to have all the necessary tools at hand.The actors put in from a half-hearted to a decent effort. A lot of great character actors (Joe Pantoliano) didn't get enough space to be interesting and there is a lot of untapped comedy resource in both Jay Mohr and Eddie Murphy. Though it has to be said \u0096 Pam Grier put in what has to be her worst performance ever as the mother of Eddie Murphy's character. One you can always trust to give his spirit is Luis Guzm\u00e1n, and he doesn't disappoint in this one either.All in all I would say there was a weak script to start with, that grew even weaker when it was handed to a director that couldn't handle the sort of comedy it was supposed to be, nor the action it was supposed to contain. Probably actors underachieved, especially in the comedy department, due to this directing. The end result was nor a comedy, nor an action \u0096 simply a bleak sci-fi that was one of the biggest net-losses in movie history if I got it right. My guess is that the guys at Warner Brothers probably are killing themselves for not picking a more suitable director.",

There's really nothing to write about this flick, it's a film where nothing stands out, it's just passable stuff. The bashing it received was way to gory to see. All I can say is watch this flick, keeping it's disastrous history behind.Eddie Murphy delivers a fine performance, so does Rosario Dawson. The actor who plays the robot Bruno is hilarious! Alec Baldwin is there in a miss-a-blink appearance.All said n done, 'The Adventures Of Pluto Nash' is an average watch. No Thumbs Up, No Thumbs Down Either!",

            "content": "Pluto Nash is one of those films that wouldn't have been so bad - if it had been done 25 years ago with no stars and a smaller budget.Now we have Eddie Murphy and a whole bunch of, albeit not A-list, solid supporting actors (Rosario Dawson excluded) aimlessly wandering about from one pointless scene to another. Part camp, part thriller, part adventure, part comedy, part sci-fi, part action part romance... and it still amounts to nothing.Everything just falls flat, and when you see the result you can't help wondering what the actors were thinking as they acted out their scenes. Obviously, it must have been a case of monetary issues - and there's nothing wrong with making money, but it doesn't make it a good, or even entertaining film.Eddie Murphy seems determined to ruin his career with utter crap like this. I mean, here we have a film that decides to take time out from the action to let the audience gawk at a french maid robot getting gradually undressed. If only the same level of attention had been given to the script as to the aforementioned robot's knickers and bra, then maybe it would have been less pointless. Still, the music was kind of catchy... [1/10]",

            "content": "First there was `Howard the Duck;' then came `Ishtar;' now we have `The Adventures of Pluto Nash,' a film so misguided in its conception and so ham-handed in its execution that it can take its rightful place among the great cinematic blunders of all time.At what point, do you reckon, in the course of making this film, did star Eddie Murphy, director Ron Underwood and the investors at Warner Brothers Studios realize what a monumental turkey they had on their hands?  In this classic misfire, Murphy plays a former smuggler turned nightclub owner who is being chased by a bunch of henchmen trying to muscle in on his scene. And, oh yes, did I forget to mention that this all takes place on the moon circa 2087?  I kid you not.  Well, all I can say is that `Total Recall' this is not.What all these people could have been thinking of when they sank their money, their time and, most important, their reputations into this hopeless enterprise is beyond mere mortal understanding.  Suffice it to say that, with the exception of some outstanding art direction, set design and special effects, `Pluto Nash' is stillborn from the word go.  The story is banal, the acting stilted, the humor nonexistent.  Most shocking of all are the alleged `action' sequences, which look as if they were shot and staged by some precocious junior high school students working on a class project for extra credit.  Murphy, Rosario Dawson, Pam Grier, Peter Boyle, John Cleese, and, above all, Randy Quaid \u0096 all fine actors under other circumstances - are made to look as ridiculous as possible, running around like mad trying to take all this seriously and pretend that they AREN'T stuck in one of the legendary bombs of all time.  It's truly a painful and embarrassing sight to behold.  Then again, how many actors can say they've appeared in one of the classic movie boners of all time?  There's immortality of sorts even in that, I guess.",

            "content": "It really is too bad. The sets looked great, the special effects on the moon were well done, it's just that the film has no soul at all. Nothing. The script was brutal to put it kindly. It is kind of like what Beverly Hills Cop 7 would have been after they had started to go downhill after the first one. Murphy tries to make it humorous, but there was no humour in any of the lines. They were just frustratingly moronic. It was 3's Company type action, with many bug-eyed looks at other characters, pratfalls, ludicrous plot holes, and juvenile humour. There are no redeeming qualities at all in this movie apart from the set design. It is really sad that a studio would waste that kind of money (100 mil) on garbage like this when the set could have been put to much better use.There are very few highlights, one in particular involving John Cleese as an automated chauffeur. But that is about it. All of the cast members are wasted in this lackluster effort, including Eddie Murphy himself. He has proved he can carry a film (Beverly Hills Cop, 48 Hours, Trading Places), but it has been a long time since he has appeared in anything decent. This could have been it, however the director went for a 3 Stooges approach instead of a much grittier and darker 48 Hours. If this movie had any of 48 Hours grit, or BHC's humour, it might have been halfway decent. Instead it is nothing more than smarmy, predictable, dull, and annoying. The fight between the Murphys at the end was very well done graphically, it wasn't possible to determine exactly how they did it (Murphy fights himself), except of course it was the type of fight that would have been more at home in an Ernest movie. All the special effects are therefore completely wasted, along with the 100 mil some studio sunk into this dog. What were they thinking? 2/10 (I gave an additional point for the sets, NOT for the movie)",

            "content": "This movie was universally banned by the critics, the viewers, the birds, the insects.. whatever! So what were its problems anyway?!I hated (Jay Mohr)'s performance, the crude jokes, and the profanity. Plus, the movie wasn't up to its high ambitions. With all of its haters, I'm still asking the bitter question: where the budget of the $100 million did go??!! The image's level was so average, ranging between the 1950s' simple space adventures, and some of the 2000s' TV tawdry show (Las Vegas), with some big cadres, but never big action sequences. The special effects were good, however not that rich or dazzling. The art direction was badly colored and generally poor, maybe too poor considering that budget!But, on the other hand, the script is vivacious, the soundtrack is enjoyable, the movie is fun. Some of the moments are so imaginative, with really smart touches in the background (The futuristic orchestra, the noisy talking car, the outrageous cloning,.. etc). And there is a certain childish spree all over it, making it wholly like a diverting comic book.Unlike the 500 million people that saw how pathetic (Randy Quaid) was, I have to disagree; the character as that creatively different sidekick, along with (Quaid)'s lovely performance, was one of the movie's most memorable points. Despite that (Rosario Dawson) wasn't up to (Eddie Murphy)'s charisma or talent, being pale beside him, but she did fine. And although they were so laconic, but I loved the cameos of (Pam Grier) and (John Cleese).(Eddie Murphy) looks in shape, however handled it moderately; he seemed not enjoying his time, or exerting more efforts. It lacked some of the (Murphy)'s moments, though his performance wasn't awful. I loved the part when he looks wordless at (Mohr)'s character, rejecting his complicated plan to sneak into the evil man's office, (Murphy) can be fabulous in silence sometimes, but originally this movie gave him not much to do whether in action or comedy. I thought this very complicated plan could have been great if they turned it into actual event, but they didn't!(Ron Underwood) is maybe the most unfortunate gifted director of all times. After engaging pieces at the early 1990s, such as (Tremors), (City Slickers), and (Heart and Souls), that included him right in my favorite directors' list, he handled (Mighty Joe Young) and (Pluto Nash) which were, one way or another, box office misfits. So he leaved, or was forced to leave, cinema to TV, just like fellows who had the same talent and the same tragedy: (Judge Dredd)'s director (Danny Cannon) after (I Still Know What You Did Last Summer). Or (Terminal Velocity)'s director (Deran Sarafian) after (Terminal Velocity) itself! It's sad, but Hollywood is ruthless... Speaking of which, I believe the way (The Adventures of Pluto Nash) was banned is surely related to the fact that there must be a movie to ban every year. So when the US gross dollars are low, and someone, just someone, says: \"This is bad\", you'll find millions of professional parrots immediately and blindly yelling: \"Hug and Cry People!\". It's the need of something that fills the Razzie nominations, where - for instance - some hits of the same box office, or a lot of (Eddie Murphy)'s other movies, deserve to be banned for its REAL bad condition, not a nice comic adventure like (Pluto Nash), which is more entertaining than the whole new trilogy of (Star Wars) at the time by the way!PS: I read that (Murphy) refused to promote the movie. Man, that's something to do with many of your other movies, not this one!",

The story is set in 2087 on the Moon, and Pluto Nash (twice Razzie nominated Eddie Murphy, for actor and couple - I'll get to that in a minute) is a night club owner who has his club blown up by the mafia when he refused to sell it. Along with his robot buddy Bruno (Independence Day's Randy Quaid) and Dina Lake (Men in Black II's Rosario Dawson) he is travelling looking for clues as to who is behind the arson. In the end, the villain turns out to be Pluto, a clone made from his appendix after an operation he had, but the real Pluto manages to save the day.

No gun shooting, tiny amusing moments or recognisable stars can save this film from being a complete failure. Along with such films as Hudson Hawk, Battlefield Earth, The Postman and Cutthroat Island; costing an estimated $100 million to make and market, it is one of the most expensive box office bombs. It was nominated the 2005 Razzie for Worst 'Comedy' of Our First 25 Years, and it was also nominated for Worst Picture and Worst Screenplay. Very, very poor!",

Effects are like Star Trek in the 70s. The only bright spots are Rosario Dawson - better and more beautiful in each movie, and Randy Quaid, acting good, though his robot humor is quite expected.

The movie was fast, had a quite cliche, but a working storyline, EXCELLENT sets and subtle humour here and there. This definetly ain't a comedy, if that's what you're looking for, but a full-scale oldskool adventure film! The theme music is kickin', and the sets and the whole movie is so colourful, you'd think it was actually made in France (Just watch i.e. Vidocq). It was like experiencing some mid-90's computergame in a movie.I think Eddie did a good job in his role of Pluto Nash, other actors were also high quality, but perhaps a bit shaded by Eddie, not because he acted better, but because of more screen time. I love to see this movie over and over again, everytime I get happy when I've watched it, and everytime I feel like I've seen one of the greatest space-adventures ever.

When he refuses the mob's offer on his nightclub they retaliate. He escapes with a young woman and his trusty robotic bodyguard. Ridiculous plot with lame situations and despite an interesting play on identities in the conclusion it is still one of the worst films of the year. Director Ron Underwood loses control early with laughable special effects. He explored different worlds from various standpoints with City Slickers and Mighty Joe Young. Eddie Murphy is obviously attempting comedy from a different viewpoint but regardless of his efforts this material is never fueled by humour. Rosario Dawson plays a singer who waits tables. So basically she the romantic tease. Randy Quaid overacts as Bruno the robot in what may be the worst role he has ever attempted to tackle. Jay Mohr is cardboard as a pathetic nightclub comedian. Peter Boyle plays a retired cop in what is about as pathetic as every other career choice in this travesty. It's candy-coated garbage that dies down like the battery in Bruno's head. Score: 1 / 10",

I waited one hour of 90 minutes for one laugh, one chuckle. Not a won. Not once did I even smirk.If it was supposed to be a Sci-Fi adventure, it also had no gravity or originality. Or fun. It was just listless with poorly designed sets that looked like they were stolen from far superior films.Was it supposed to be a romantic drama? Nope. No chemistry here from any of the actors, male/female or otherwise.Finally, I guess it could've been attempting to be a futuristic, action flick.

Had it not be for those awesome guys over at the How Did This Get Made podcast, I would have lived out the rest of my days oblivious to how horrid this picture was.Pretty much, in this failed sitcom pilot of a feature-length, (hasn't been funny in about two decades) Eddie Murray plays the title character on the moon and when his nightclub is threatened by the building of a casino \u2013 wait, stop. I know it's been a couple of weeks since I've seen this, but is there not A WHOLE LOTTA ROOM ON THE MOON to build this casino without having to do the age old \"if you don't sell, I'll make your life hell so I can become rich on your land\" plot?Actually, screw this movie. There is absolutely nothing here worth mentioning or thinking about. Eddie looked bored and uninterested, as did most of the other cast. I do, however recommend you listen to the How Did This Get Made podcast on this. Not only is it enormously hilarious, but they give you a bunch of fun background information that makes this project all the more worthless.* * * Final thoughts: Okay, I've never been an Eddie Murphy fan.

And when it actually premieres it\u00b4s not even shown to the critics. Studio executives say that the special effects needed fixing until the very last minute, but people know the truth. The product sucks big time.Pluto Nash is an awful comedy. Behind the polished and fine-looking surface there\u00b4s a crappy movie that wants to be so much, but ends up being a total flop. When Eddie Murphy\u00b4s good he\u00b4s really good (\"the Nutty Professor\", \"Bowfinger\"), but when he\u00b4s awful he really sucks (\"Pluto Nash\", \"Metro\"). I haven\u00b4t seen \"I Spy\" or \"Showtime\" yet, but being a movie fan I know those two considerably big movies flopped as well. Poor Eddie has now scored three back-to-back flops which isn\u00b4t a good thing in Hollywood.The (Horrible) Adventures Of Pluto Nash is said to be a comedy, but I didn\u00b4t find myself laughing while watching the movie. On the contrary. Few amusing lines don\u00b4t make a comedy and even good actors can\u00b4t be funny if the script and the characters are simply not funny. Even John Cleese has a small part in this turkey... How on earth did they get him aboard? All the cast members can do a lot better, I presume they all just lost their judgment for a minute when signing to do Pluto Nash. That can be forgiven with time and a lot smaller salaries for their next projects would be a suitable punishment.Pluto Nash takes place in the Moon and that would actually be the only correct place for a movie like this: far from the civilization and fans of good movies.",

Director Underwood manages to get a good cast like Joe Pantoliano, Jay Mohr, Luis Guzman, James Rehborn, Peter Boyle, Pam Grier and more. The supporting cast has little to do here expect for Quaid and a bit part by John Clesse have the best moments in the movie. Murphy has some good moments here, Dawson is extremely likable but the last act of the film is a major disappointment. It is probably why that this movie flopped. Special Visual Effects are a mixed bag here. If it had re-shoots and a better third act, this feature could have been saved. There's worst Eddie Murphy movies than this one.

And then came the wild adventure. A little too wild, but quite funny at times.I thought Eddie Murphy did an okay job as Pluto but he was even better when he appeared as Pluto's clone. The visual effects where Pluto and his clone were together were amazing--it really looked like both characters were there, without one appearing to be up against a blue screen.I really liked Bruno. I don't know how his voice ended up being so metallic, but I assume it was Randy Quaid's performance that made this character work. He was really funny. I especially liked the scene with robot Babette, who was stuck in an 'oops' program.And I liked Tony Francis as a singer. In this sci-fi world, so much of the music sounded so futuristic, though not that different from today. Tony's schmaltzy Vegas-style performance was a breath of fresh air. And I liked his orchestra, though I wasn't quite clear on whether that box in front of the conductor was the whole thing.Let's not forget John Cleese as the talking car, whose 'face' appeared on a small screen complete with a chauffeur's uniform.

And yet, you as viewer, are treated to a -I admit- mediocre story, but with EXCELLENT special effects. I like to think of \"The Adventures of Pluto Nash\" as a feel-good science fiction. There is no 'deep' philosophical theme going on, but then again: this film never pretends to be like that. It's just a film with a happy ending. Yay!Here are some things I really enjoyed:Low/no gravity battle. Did Star Trek ever do this? Once! Almost every SF film or series ever tries to evade low/no-grav battles. And yet, it looks so cool! The special effect department did a wonderful job making this look realistic.Futuristic dancing. I love that! Every decade has it's own silly dances and it's so funny to look at this from an outsiders point of view. Just like watching 'jumpstyle'.John Cleese was a realistic and believable CGI character. I don't need to reminds you how awful CGI characters can turn out (Jar Jar Binks!). Cleese was a floating projection of a head in a hovercar, but he was memorable and quotable.The gun that goes 'WWWWHHHHhhhhhhiiiiiiiiiiiiiii' in an super high pitched tone when it locks on target.An android with a personality. Star Trek needed many seasons to establish the character of Data, but \"Pluto Nash\" gives us at least one android with a genuine personality. Very nicely integrated into the story too. The music was great. I am personally not really fan of R&B or rap, but I loved the way the music was put into the story:*The dancing and the 'fast-forward' R&B music were hilarious*Songs about the moon*The 'scratching' sounds during fight scenes worked out perfectly*The up-beat R&B style music was contrasted by some other types of music, like Tony Francis' show and his intro song (when he's wearing a kilt). Refreshingly divers. Some have said it wasn't funny enough. I think these reviewers are not getting the subtle humor of this film. If you were hoping for Police Academy jokes, this might not be for you. The level of sarcasm is higher, e.g.,\" That's what I love about you. I ask you a simple question and four hours later I get a simple answer.\") The TWIST in the end. In retrospective it makes sense, but it really comes as a surprise on the first viewing.CGI was great. The Lunar Highway scene, the deserted desert area of the moon with Earth in the background, the establishing shot of 'Little America', the hovercar chase... All very impressive.This film is getting a lower rating then it should get. There are enough movie references in this film for a film student to write a small paper about. There are worse films out there like \"A Sound of Thunder\" that get a higher rating than this film, even though they had a comparable budget yet messed up on the story AND the CGI.",

The only surprise in the whole thing was when Pluto Nash found out who he was up against. The movie was just Eddie Murphy doing the same old thing again. He could have just as well done it on earth in the 21th Century. At least he would have saved us a trip to the moon.",

The visual side of the film is occasionally spectacular but nothing can overcome the increasingly frequent hollywoodian syndrome of having scripts and dialogs that look as if they were written by drunken apes, I mean zero intelligence, zero subtlety, zero coherence all amounting to one gigantic mess of half baked concepts that never gel into anything resembling a decent film.To top it off for an action comedy the action part is feeble at best and the least said about the jokes the better(oh the endless horny robot jokes).

I'll have to admit I thought it was Terry O'Quinn (\"Lost\": John Locke), which made even funnier at the time, but it's a good job done.Honestly, Eddie Murphy and Rosario Dawson feel a little big for their roles, but the story is good: a former smuggler turns legitimate business owner has to find the mob boss behind the people trying to kill him.While I do think this is an average movie, it is solid, and I don't think I would go changing a lot to it.

PLUTO is pretty bad, and what's worse is it's not even a memorable kind of bad, a camp classic. PLUTO is just a dreary blah kind of bad, really tiredly put together like everyone was going through the motions. It's the kind of thing that saps your soul and spirit, truly. This feels like a complicated tax shelter in the guise of a movie.What it actually reminded me of, in fact, was VAN HELSING, assuming VH was trying to be a light action sf-comedy, instead of a semi tongue-in cheek horror/action spectacular. But it's the exact same kind of vibe. Although VH looked a hell of a lot better: the production design here is absolutely awful, with sets that look like a cross between BLADE RUNNER, \"Bablyon Five\", and late Eighties music videos. I'm not usually one to notice lighting or cinematography, but somehow everyone looks awful or washed out -- especially Rosario Dawson, arguably one of the most beautiful women in film today.The script is awful. We discover Pluto Nash is a great guy by everyone saying what a great guy he is -- although he just seems like Eddie Murphy to me. At certain predetermined points people break character to do the predetermined things the script requires of them to continue the story. (That's called \"hackwork\".) The general plot seems borrowed straight from HARLEM NIGHTS, which I remember liking one hell of a lot better. Except this one's on the moon. The big reveal -- Eddie is fighting Eddie! -- makes no sense whatsoever.A lot of good actors, but they all seem a beat behind, or stiff, or whatever. Eddie himself is just doing his new \"cleaned up him\" thing. Frankly, I've always liked Eddie Murphy, but he's a guy who needs a strong cast to bounce off of. (Actually, I think he's essentially a great supporting actor miscast as a leading man too often.) He can't carry anything on his own.So no, it's as bad as they say, and in a cheesy, depressing kind of way, too. It's like getting drunk on wine coolers: you wake up the next morning both hungover and sort of ashamed of the whole thing.",

It lacks adventure and is not funny or interesting. I can only assume by the the talent in the cast (Murphy, Rosario Dawson, Burt Young, Randy Quaid, Joe Pantolino, Luis Guzman, Peter Boyle, John Cleese, Pam Grier and James Rebhorn) that at some point this movie was decent on paper, and read funny. Then it was botched on it is way to the big screen. The potential was there.Ron Underwood directed one of my favourite movies in City Slickers and a movie I really, really enjoy in Tremors. Was he hampered by meddling producers or studio execs?? Who knows!! But this is some uninspired directing. A prime example is I watched an episode of the tv show Seaquest DSV with Roy Schieder before this movie, and that TV effort from 1993 was better directed, and had better effects. As for Murphy, he is on autopilot. Rosario Dawson, is bland (but not as bad as she was in Men In Black 2) and she had zero chemistry with Murphy. As shown in Seven Pounds, she is a talented actress, John Powell actually gives the movie a much better score than it deserves!! The movie had actually been sitting on a shelf for two years before finally being released in 2002. It was an extremely expensive movie starring a big Hollywood star. But it was so bad, the studio waited two years to release it. After viewing the movie, Alex Baldwin insisted on being uncredited, whilst Murphy refused to promote the film, and stated that the money is the only reason he took the role. In absolute terms, this movie made the largest financial loss of any movie to date, with a budget of $100 million and a total US gross of $4.41 million (loss of $95.59 million) and a lifetime worldwide gross of $7,103,973 for a total loss of $92,896,027",

Personally, I had no expectations other than my knowledge that Murphy is a guy who likes to experiment, and who makes good movies more often than not.As other reviewers have pointed out, Pluto Nash is best viewed not as a comedy, but as light-hearted sci-fi. It's a simple little cops-and-robbers yarn, presented against a rather brilliantly realized futuristic backdrop. This film gets things right about future Moon colonies that other more 'serious' sci-fi films never even get close to.The scene where Murphy lies back and looks at the stars while cruising the lunar highway in his stolen car is worth the price of admission all by itself... a true 'sense-of-wonder' moment that reminds me (as most sci-fi films don't) of why I fell in love with science fiction in the first place. To Pluto Nash, the Moon is just a place, where the age-old human drama is going to be played out all over again; it's a seedy, corrupt little truck stop... but it's on the road to the stars.How can you not like a movie that makes a statement like that?No, Pluto Nash isn't 2001. Nor Beverly Hills Cop. But it is a unique and very likable synthesis of the two. And, come on: if it's just laughs you want, Randy Quaid as the last-year's-model robot bodyguard IS side-splitting.",

A review for this movie may seem to be anti-climactic since this will be the lowest point in the film career of Eddie Murphy. During the past couple of years, Eddie Murphy had some hits(perferrably the films like \"48 Hours\",\"Trading Places\",\"Beverly Hills Cop\",\"Harlem Nights\",\"Life\",\"The Nutty Professor\",and its sequel \"Nutty Professor II:The Klumps\",\"Boomerang\",and to even mention his stand-up comedy film \"Raw\"),and the misses with the audience in general(\"The Golden Child\",\"Showtime\",\"Doctor Doolittle\", and the sequel Doctor Doolittle II\",\"Metro\",\"Vampire In Brooklyn\" add to this list his recent resume)and so much more. For hearsay,Eddie Murphy was the #1 Soul-boxoffice brother during the 80's and early 90's,but here you can see how the downfall to this gifted entertainer can come to a grinding halt and for some this maybe the career downfall of a once funny star.But in general in the mere chance that there's somebody out there still intrigued at the prospect of seeing the diverse likes of John Cleese, Pam Grier,and Burt Young all gracing the same film,I'm here to say that this worth not the time nor the money,nor the cost of deterioration of brain cells which is more to say about the abysmal effort,which is set on the moon in the year 2087 in which Murphy plays an entrepreneur whose successful business in tangled with a ruthless gangster who is on the run dragging a aspired singer(Rosario Dawson)and one horny robot(of all people played with such spirit by Randy Quaid).

I find it difficult to say where this went wrong. The best I can figure is that it is stuck between a sci-fi movie and a comedy, and in doing so it fails at both. The comedy is not strong enough to support the movie. And the sci-fi is likewise not strong enough to keep the viewer's attention. Many people praise the sci-fi aspect of the movie, but part of the problem is that the attempts at comedy tend to detract from creating a true sci-fi tenor. For example, Quaid's performance is decent as a comedic part, but he is just goofy and so it's difficult to take the plot or the movie seriously. By comparison, Total Recall has some comedic parts, but they are effective and brief enough to not affect the sci-fi tenor. On the other hand, something like Spaceballs (or Dark Star) doesn't take itself too seriously and works as a comedy. Perhaps another matter is that we have high expectations for Eddie Murphy, and thus we are more critical of his work. Also, perhaps we have seen and heard his mannerisms so many times that the humor has worn off (e.g. Eddie's classic laugh).",

There were several interesting casting choices, of which I heartily approved.  Randy Quaid was very odd but very funny as Bruno, the bodyguard robot; Joe Pantoliano looked odd with hair and a mustache; and Alec Baldwin had an uncredited cameo which was classic Baldwin.

Th storyline is really rather silly and pointless and the performances range from dreadful (Murphy, Joe Pantoliano as a mob henchman) to embarassing (Randy Quaid as a  robot!) to almost decent (Rosario Dawson as the love interest, Jay Mohr as a lounge singer). For a comedy, the jokes are few and far between, with only Quaid's impossibly bad performance and hamming providing any kinda of humor. The action pieces are also kinda weak.. On the plus side however, the film looks great. The production team did a fabulous job of creating the future world of the moon and they throw in a lot of nice little jokes into the sets that those bored with the main story might enjoy. The visual effects are also impressive, for the most part. So you could enjoy the film on a technical standpoint. It isnt an awful movie and is certainly watchable but it is not very good either.

I mean silly without being too tasteless as the film does succeed only to a small extent in nonsensical entertainment.

The humour works in the first half because of fleeting funny characters such as Illeana Douglas's Dr. Mona Zimmer, John Cleese's James the CyberDriver and Pam Grier as the hot mom provide plenty to laugh about. Eddie Murphy has already proved to be one of the most successful comedy actors and while this certainly isn't even close to his being his best movie or his best role, he does make you chuckle a couple of times in the first half and one can easily notice his lack of interest in the second half. Rosario Dawson is pretty much just required to be the damsel in distress type but the actress isn't given much to do other than play the typical quiet heroine that tags along, waiting for the hero to save her. Needless to say, the writing is dreadful. There are but a few amusing lines which is probably why the main cast doesn't look the least bit interested.

There are moments where its entertaining and I enjoyed some of the banter as well as some of the effects, but the sum was far less than the parts. The one scene that I laughed at was when Jay Mohr was explaining his escape plan to Eddie, one of the dumbest escape plans in the history of bad escape plans, and Eddie just looks at him like he's a moron, not looking away for what seemed a solid 60 seconds. This joke took time to set up and someone talented to pull it off. Eddie is still talented in that he knows comedy and what can make people laugh. But for some time now all he has done are movies that are less interested in taking the time to make the joke work and more interested with throwing as much slightly amusing trash-talk at the audience as they can in 120 minutes and hope enough sticks to call itself a good comedy.

While Pluto Nash has an impressive cast, including Eddie Murphy, Randy Quaid, Jay Mohr, Pam Grier, and Alec Baldwin in a cameo appearance, it lacks good writing.  In fact, a rerun of The Jetsons would be more entertaining.The year is 2087, on the moon, in a full gravity town called Little Americ a. Pluto Nash (Eddie Murphy) plays an ex-con turned nightclub owner.  The local mob offers to buy Pluto's successful club (`Club Nash'), but after he refuses to sell, the mob blows up the joint, and the chase begins. Pluto and his beautiful waitress/singer Dina Lake (Rosario Dawson), and his Robot (Randy Quaid) are chased by the gangsters, while they try to find and confront Rex Crater, the head of the mob.Pluto's attitude-filled but hilarious mother (Pam Grier) could have added some more humorous moments to the movie, but she only appeared in a few minor scenes.Randy Quaid, (Bruno the bald-headed Robot), is not nearly as funny as his other witty characters of past movies (my all time favorite - Cousin Eddy- National Lampoon's Vacation movies).  His performance was adequate, but repetitive lines and tired jokes got old very quickly.The only scenes that made me snicker were the ones that featured the goofy, 1950-ish B-movie spacesuits. They reminded me of sci-fi parodies from Mystery Science Theater 3000, and Spaceballs.The genre for this film says comedy/action/sci-fi.  If this is so, then it's a comedy that has no funny jokes, action that has cheesy scenes, and a sci-fi with untasteful and unrealistic effects.The uncreative and lame scenes seem to jump around with confusing transitions, giving the feeling that there was some serious cutting going on in the editing room.Ron Underwood, (Tremors and City Slickers) didn't have much of a story to work with, however, there were some clever sight gags.  For instance, Hilary Clinton's mug showing up on a $10,000 bill, Trump buildings, and a frozen dog that can be thawed in a microwave.  Writer Neil Cuthbert, (Mystery Men and Hocus Pocus), could have taken his futuristic story line, and created the funniest movie of the summer; however, on film the story was `lost in space'.  Having said that, it makes sense that Warner Brothers shelved this project for two years after filming.where it should have stayed.There is no doubt that this would have been a hit in the 70's and 80's, but in 2002, its simply dated!Expect to find Pluto Nash on the $1.99 clearance table at your local video store very soon.Rated PG-13 for violence, sexual humor and language.

Even if there were, they were less than a handful, compared to the entire film which both entertained and had realistic Moon/sci-fi action.  The director and special effects people did their homework.  There were some weak points in the plot, such as some of Pluto's motives, but I understood the entire story.

It's a mediocre comedy that falls a little short, but with some alternate casting, could have been great.Eddie Murphy is an ex-smuggler in the year 2078, when the Moon has been colonized. Overall, the opening sequence, which gives much of Murphy's past, could have been, and should have been longer, as it comes into play later. Why? Murphy vaguely mentions he had surgery done in prison. This was used to clone Murphy's twin Rex Crater (Also played by Murphy). But unless you have a word-for-word memory of the first scenes, you'll forget that was ever mentioned and get lost later. The movie could have been set in modern times, so why they had it done in the future is not known to me.One gets the feeling this movie would have been better with Will Smith as the part of Pluto Nash. Murphy is doubt a great comedian, but he's no action star, which Nash was. Had Smith done the role, this movie would have been better. Mainly because the comedic Murphy isn't comedic here: most of the laughs come from his android bodyguard. Among other things, a brisk walk is his top speed, he is attracted to other robots (Although how robots do...that, I'm not sure exactly), and is laughed at for being a out-of-date model. Had the comedy genre been dropped, and Smith cast instead of Murphy, the movie would have been okay. As it is, it's not terrible, but you aren't missing anything.",

            "content": "Ah, Eddie Murphy. Sometimes I wonder if he sits up at night and makes wishes on shooting stars, asking that he be transported to the 1980's where everything was rosy and right with the world (and his career). Because, as we all know, these past couple of years have not been good for the iconic comedian. Showtime tanked, I Spy tanked (mostly because it was a film adaptation of a show that no one remembered and was a poor rip-off of Owen Wilson's own Shanghai franchise), The Holy Man tanked, Daddy Day Care made money but was ripped to shreds by critics, and his only major success came with the release of Dreamworks' animated smash Shrek. But every actor has that one movie that they would like to forget, the one humiliating bomb that is the equivalent of a mutant cousin hiding in the basement, ready to rear its ugly, pillow shaped head at any moment. For Eddie, the deformed relative is The Adventures of Pluto Nash, which is now infamous for losing the most money of any feature film in history. I think the final cost of the film was in the ballpark of $90 million, but it was held from release for over two years before being quietly presented and withdrawn from theaters. The film's total gross? A paltry $2 million or so. Yeesh, talk about a giant misstep. Of course, being the bad movie patron that I am, I heard all about this movie's history, but didn't bother to investigate the actual film until yesterday, when I spotted a VHS copy at a Blockbuster Video sale for like three bucks. Surprisingly, and I say this without having seen Showtime or I Spy, this is not the worst movie Eddie has starred in, at least in my opinion. Sure the comedy is pretty stale, and Eddie is just going through the motions as Pluto Nash, but in the end my one question is why this had to take place on the moon. Aside from a handful of elements, there was no need for this movie to be set in space. The story has less to do with something about the moon and more about Godfather-type gangsters. It could have just as easily taken place on Earth in the future, in my opinion, and the filmmakers could have saved a nice chunk of cash in the process. And while the story is kind of yawn-inducing, the \"surprise\" twist had me groaning. Let me paint the picture here: There's an episode of the hilarious show Family Guy where the main character Peter reminisces about the time his wife Louis killed his evil twin. Louis is then shown aiming a pistol at two Peters, both of which are saying stuff like, \"Shoot him, Louis! I'm the real Peter!\" and, \"Louis, don't you know your own husband? Shoot him!\" The joke was great because it captured an archaic movie cliche so perfectly, so it really made me wince to see such an old device being used in Pluto Nash. There is actually a point in the film where Eddie and his evil clone are trying to convince someone to shoot their opponent. \"I'm the real Pluto Nash! Shoot him!\" \"No, he's lieing! Don't shoot me, he's the clone!\" Oh brother! And is it just me, or do all of the \"futuristic\" landscapes and gizmos look like somethin out of Back To The Future Part II? Considering that movie came out over 10 years ago, this is not a good thing. But like I said before, this isn't at all painful to watch and goes by pretty fast for a mob movie set IN SPACE. Sheesh. 2/4 stars",

A location where gambling, girls, criminals and all things seedy are rampant, a bit like Las Vegas in the old days. Eddie Murphy is a retired smuggler who runs a nightclub on the moon and wants a quiet life, but this is all messed up when some goons come along and force Murphy out by destroying his club under the orders of a mysterious kingpin. Its now up to 'Pluto Nash' to find out why, who is the man behind it all and try to get his club back, or what's left of it.I think the first issue with the film are the visuals. The film is oldish but not that old and unfortunately the CGI effects are pretty poor. Shots of the moon, moving vehicles, the lunar surface and of course Little America just look average and obviously CGI. When we close in on the urban areas the sets aren't too bad in design but again its terribly obvious its all sets. It all looks like a very mediocre attempt at a 'Blade Runner-esque' grimy neon lit urban district. The colour palette doesn't really help with everything being grey and boring, yes I know its the moon and the moon is typically grey but come on. There were some nice 50's-esque designs on some buildings and vehicles though, there was that element throughout the film but it still felt drab and lifeless, virtually black and white.Then you have all the interior sets, design and costumes...its all grey!! everything is grey! flippin' eck!. Not only that but the interior designs look so dated, like its all been reused from a 60's TV sci-fi show. I understand that doesn't necessarily make it bad, there are plenty of examples where films have deliberately gone down the homage route or retro design/vibe which can work wonders giving a great charm factor. The problem here is the film had a massive budget and you wonder what they actually used it on.Take the robot character played by Quaid (and the maid robot character). What they have done is simply apply a lot of makeup to Quaid to give him a doll-like appearance, then he merely acts out the robot role. Now again this can be done and it can work but probably best in low budget films that have little choice. In a big production it just tends to feel lackluster, the maid robot was the same but dressed up in a sexy French number as if that makes it more acceptable. I did quite like the 50's sci-fi sense I got from Quaid's robot though, like a butch Robbie the Robot in human form...kinda hehe.Whilst watching I also found the plot to be a tad confusing really, or at least it didn't make much sense because it was all a muddle of grey. There are a lot of character names flying about here, a lot of seemingly pointless stuff, aimless boring dialog and not much action believe it or not. We just move from one cheap looking grey set to the next with little to laugh, disappointing seeing as its supposedly a Murphy sci-fi action romp.But is it? you think it is but its not really, its more like a 1950's nightclub murder noir homage, 'Harlem Nights' in space perhaps. I must admit to thinking of 'Total Recall' at times whilst watching, it has that kind of vibe going on, minus all the excellent action and blood of course. Do I get the feeling this was made and acted the way it was on purpose?...was it?! I'm not sure, I'd like to think that but deep down I really doubt it. I just think it was a poorly executed movie which had potential to become a bit of a classic. I can see why people might enjoy bits of it like Quaid's cheesy robotic performance and the minor visual gags dotted throughout, but end of the day this really feels like its trying to achieve what 'The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai' achieved.I'm still not really sure whether or not this film was intentionally made like a low budget sci-fi B-movie for artistic reasons, or it just came out that way. The more I think about it, this might have worked much better as a short TV series, it certainly has the look and feel.4.5/10",

Instead I was more impressed by the performance of Jacynthe Rene' who played Babette the french robot maid. Her performance reminded me of the creative performers of Cirque' du Solei, who use actions rather than words to entertain. Although,her performance consits mostly of dropping her feather duster, bending over, and saying \"Oops\", it is the most entertaing part of the movie i.m.h.o.   The worst part of the movie,  Jay Mohr trying to perform as a Frank Sinatra lounge singer. So 3 stars for Jacynthe Rene' and and 1 star for the special effects of the movie. Watch this movie only if you receive a free movie coupon, enjoy campy sci-fi jokes, or are passionate for french maids.",

Boasting another cheesy-but-fun synthesized fanfare, as well as layers upon layers of pop-rhythms and crazy sound effects, the score immediately goes into frantic overdrive whenever something interesting happens, employing fast, driving synthesized drums during slow motion scenes set in a low gravity environment.Allow me to give an example of Powell's scoring approach:After the villainous thugs have disappeared, Pluto slowly but deliberately leaves his cover behind the futuristic space bar \u0096 scored with a loud, droning synth rhythm.Pluto races across the room \u0096 racing strings getting faster and faster and faster until\u0085 Pluto gets to the other side of the room: Cue heroic theme!

Even Randy Quaid is positively rancidly annoying in this film. I really wanted to like this movie, but I find that I just can't. Make a compilation of all the effects and artistry and I'll give it a huge thumbs up, but it's not worth wading through everything else to get to it. Will WB even bother releasing this on home video?

            "content": "A setting on the moon? Alright. Anti-gambling propaganda? Why not? Because the film's central character is hardly more moral than Four Fingers from Snatch. If anything, Pluto Nash is hornier than the cast of Snatch combined.Snatch was definitely a movie with much more story than feminine innuendo (probably because few women appeared in the movie). Pluto Nash however is some guy who is perverted in ways that I draw the line...For instance, this robot maid is designed by him so she can constantly drop things. And his favorite part is watching the maid bend over to pick it up... especially when he gets to stand behind her. In another instance, he talks about how the female lead needs her body improved. The term \"improved\" is best used loosely given that the female lead - being played by Rosario Dawson - is already curvaceous.Dawson's character, Dina, is one of the only two characters with whom I can sympathize - the other being the holographic chauffeur of a car that Pluto steals, crashes, and leaves deserted in the middle of nowhere! Half the lines that John Cleese was given to work with there make said chauffeur somewhat amusing, so sympathy is easier.Pluto gets away with all these sins because he was trying to put an end to gambling... which can be compared to how a stockbroker works!!The villain may not be worth rooting for either, but being a clone - which is about as legal in this movie as it is in The 6th Day - has all the reason possible to make himself mysterious. And killing people to keep it that way is the only crime this villain actually commits.Those elements combined with characters that are quite underdeveloped (if they were even developed at all) leave this move lacking in both style and substance. If you want to find either one of those, John Powell's musical score is the only thing that can suffice. Eddie Murphy's career didn't die immediately from this flop, but as far as that downward trajectory goes, this was definitely the beginning.",

Feels like \"politics\",  but perhaps it could have been \"Timing\".Eddie playing \"a suave and sophisticated bar owner on the moon\",  seems like a pretty cool foundation a movie,  especially when you add a razy side kick like \"Randy Quaid\" as a robot.Then the movie takes it back to more \"old school\" with the infamous \"Blacksploitation Actress\", PAM GRIER.  ( Looking as good as ever ),  and especially tough while helping to run down the bad guys. (Pam is still all that)!My first introduction to Mr. Boyle was in the De Nero movie, (Taxi Driver).  Through the years he has done an awesome job in both areas of comedy, (Gege Wilder / Mel Brooks), to dramas.The casting was like something sent down from \"The Movie Gods\".  Not to mention that \"Whacky Assed Jay Mohr\", who played behind a Celebrity name I have not heard of since the 60s,  (Tony Francis)..... Heh, Heh...Over all,  the movie did well!  My perspective is from looking at black actors from the \"Stepin' Fetchit\" era, up to present.  I view this movie as \"A DEFINITE STEP FORWARD\",  and perhaps with a different chemistry, (Viewing the down falls of this movie),  one should take all elements into consideration, and just \"DO IT AGAIN!!!!\"Hats off to all involved in this venture.  Lets, again, contribute an even larger positive lead by evolving the acting spectrum, as a whole!Also, would love to see Jacynthe Rene` (Babette), again but in an expanded role.  She has a lot of potential acting in American movies;<)From the words of Eddie Murphy himself:  \"Its All Good\"!  My favorite saying, only because its true.\nTony M. FiveDolphins",

I did think that the fact that the villain is a clone of Pluto Nash himself was kind of lame but it did make for a few decent jokes. In the end, Pluto Nash saves the day, it has a happy ending which is probably good since I think it may have been marketed as a kid's movie. Nash gets to keep his club and everything is alright in the end. Not a terrible movie but not a laugh-out-loud great comedy, or even a good comedy at that.",

Randy Quaid was miscast as the robot. He's too tall and imposing to be a subservient geeky robot.  Although there were some good moments, he has no comic delivery or timing-especially for the kind of quick-witted comic style of Murphy. Substitute a Robin Williams, Steve Martin or Jim Carrey type for the robot, make the robot gay with a unrequited love interest in Murphy, and then, finally, dump the trite and time worn clone idea and make Quaid the Howard Hughes villain.  Much much better.   Next, the Frank Sinatra character. Very good idea but the guy couldn't sing and looked like a grocery clerk. Get someone who can sing, wear a fedora, drape a sport jacket over his shoulder, and do the Las Vegas thing.In short, the film had mega opportunities to comically exploit hilarious stereotypes in a creative setting but then completely and mysteriously missed the boat. And it looked like Eddie Murphy knew, as he was almost reluctantly reciting this lines, that the movie was going to be a flop. Five out of 10.",

That Leslie Nielsen vehicle is not only by far the worst sci-fi comedy ever conceived, but in the running for the most godawful movie ever created. If that movie were put into a time capsule for future generations to find, it would suggest a race of total jackasses. Pluto Nash, however, only suggests childish filmmakers, which is quite welcome after all of the heavy, serious fare we've seen lately. So to all of you knocking this movie because it's not funny, it's not interesting, or whatever, why not rent a copy of 2001: A Space Travesty? I guarantee you that Pluto Nash will feel like Gladiator after the unrelenting 90 minutes of hell that lie in wait for you. In this respect, I feel Pluto Nash has been unfairly criticized.",

            "content": "Which came first Independence Day or The Adventures of Pluto Nash? Independence Day was released six years before Pluto Nash. The connection between the two? James Rebhorn appeared in both. Seeing him looking younger in Pluto Nash than he did in ID added to my sense that Pluto Nash was a late 80s or early 90s film. It just has that look and feel to it. Pluto Nash resembles 1986's Howard the Duck more than its 2002 brethren Star Wars Episode II, Lord of the Rings II, Spider Man, or MIB II (which also included Rosario Dawson). The reason that Pluto Nash seems out of place is that its genesis came in the mid-80s. For some reason, no one stuck a fork in it. Going into production 15 years (in 2000) after its conception is odd to say the least. The mid-80s were not the early 2000s. What might have been entertaining in 1985 wasn't so in 2002. The 80s were just a very different time. Pluto Nash has such an 80s feel to it that I distinctly remember watching it repeatedly on HBO while in my apartment. The thing is, I had moved from that apartment in 1988. Freaky false memory, huh? Other 80s features of Pluto Nash are its dialog, sets, coloration, and special effects. Cheesy is the word that describes the general feel of Pluto Nash. What perplexes me is that this movie cost about $125 million dollars. I could not see anything or any combination of things in Pluto Nash that should have added up to $125 million. A fifth of that? A fourth of that? Maybe. Maybe Eddie Murphy made a killing with his salary. Maybe Warner Brothers worked with the federales to funnel cash to the NSA, and Pluto Nash really cost only $1 million to make. The extra $124 million would buy a lot of flash drives.As cheesy and unbelievably expensive as this movie is, it is still moderately entertaining. Eddie Murphy (who hit his stride in the 80s and probably peaked just before this movie) is an entertainer through and through. I can't think of many roles where I haven't felt good from watching him work. (Delirious is one funny standup performance with him in that red leather jumpsuit and all.) Rosario Dawson spent a lot of the movie doing nothing but looking cute, and she excelled in that. (She's another performer who seldom disappoints.) Randy Quaid made a good performance as an outdated android. The part didn't have much depth or opportunities, but he scored some of the movie's best lines. All of the humor in Pluto Nash was subtle. Very subtle, but there nonetheless.Pluto Nash is a good movie to have on as background stimulus. Maybe at a family holiday gathering when the movie is secondary.",

The problem (at least for the studio) is that this never was going to be a movie that could make $100 million, yet they green lit the spending for it.  Even with BOFFO worldwide and video sales, this will probably not even get within making half of their money back now.  One wonders what the producers were thinking, considering everything going against this movie:  1) Too goofy a title to be a summer blockbuster, 2) Eddie Murphy (other than Dr Doolittle & Nutty Professor movies) hasn't been a box office draw in 10 years), 3) I never saw a TV ad for this that I can recall, so, obviously the studio thought it wasn't even worth promoting once it got made.   This is really this summer \"Anti-Fat Greek Wedding\" (which was made for $5 million and will make $100 million, vs. the other way around).",

I would easily closely compare this one to the likes of \"THE FIFTH ELEMENT, DEMOLITION MAN or TERMINATOR SERIES\".All of these movies have rediculous, or unbelievable subject matter, but entertaining just the same.Timing also played a big part in this movie.  I truly believe that had this movie been released at the right time, it could have made all the difference.The entire cast and crew were GREAT!  I especially enjoyed the little things, (details that mattered),  which laced the entire movie together.The only thing I see here is that prevous movies Eddie Murphy starred seemed to shoot for a younger audience, where as this movie was set in the future,  it used a number of actors from an older age group.  (That is probably what attracted me).I guess if its all about the bottom line, ($$$ Cha-Ching $$$),  one must be more aware of the market they are targeting by using newer names (perhaps),  while also being aware who has the power or control in the movie.Its all good!

Back to the film. There was not much to the film. Characterisations were very simplistic, and the 'robots' were very curious in their presentation. It was quite a violent film, and what there was did not appear as comedic violence. One of the villains was especially ugly in a fashion which I suspect was comedic - cross eyes, curious gate etc. Murphy didn't add anything at all to a fairly limp script, and the Nash character was hard to pin down. There were a number of car chases 'on the moon', one featuring John Cleese, but any comedic angle to this went over my head. The end was very light - seeming to lack any sense of threat/urgency/difficult job well done etc. All in all, this was a poor film with what seemed high production costs but had neither any sense of originality, urgency or character empathy.

The jokes never got one laugh out of me. The cinematography is the definition of uninspired. Everything just blends in with a greyish metal and looks like every other Sci-Fi film since 1982. The special effects have a decent amount of practical effects and the CGI is dated but average. The music just like everything else is perfectly generic and forgettable. The editing is the most bizarre part of this. It feels like this is a Sci-Fi Film, A Noir Film & A Comedy all merged together. And the end result is a film that has no clear identity, tone or bite to it. half the time I can't tell whether the film is trying to be funny or serious. The pacing is oddly enough just ok. Never did I feel a scene went on too long (this is only a 1 Hour 30 minute film) but it never built tension or ramped up anything it just stayed at a perfectly consistent pace. This film can be summed up as if a computer was given millions of dollars to make a big budget film this is what it would present as the finished product. I've seen much much worse films than this. This isn't broken it just doesn't have any redeeming qualities to it. It's Not Good, I wouldn't even call it average its perfectly Below Average-Average. Skip this because the film clearly doesn't care so why should you.",

How can you not like a movie that has Randy Quaid, Hottie Rosario Dawson, Joe Pantoliano, Peter Boyle, Burt Young, John Cleese, Illeana Douglas, Jay Mohr, Jacynthe Rene (can you get me..) and the beautiful Pam Grier. It is chock full of stars of various fame set on the moon. The criticism of the language and sexual content is absurd. It is one Eddie Murphy's least offensive films of all. Everything is well timed. Love that french maid. Lastly the comparison to the fifth element. I have to question whether the critic ever saw the 5th Element to say that.\n\nAt least the comparison to the Matrix with the chase scene in the tunnels is acceptable. Still, it is explainable and fits the movie rather than a copycat. Did I mention the french maid?\nThen the criticism of Murphy himself. He may be vulgar and a bit brash at times but he always gave a great performance. Then the cast around him... they are great. This is one of Dennis Quaid's best films as corny as his character may be, it is memorable. \nForget the critics reviews. Enjoy this movie for what it is, a fun romp on the moon. Sit back and enjoy Eddie Murphy in a completely alien environment from any other movie he has made. It is well worth your time.",

Having on the its moon instead of on Terra didn't really add a lot to the movie except to facilitate a flimsy backstory and some scenes where people required environmental suits, and that had little payoff.\n\nThe benefits of being a sci-fi action comedy is to have laser effects for the blasters, and androids, which are used to various levels of humor.  \n\nEddie Murphy is great, and he plays well with Rosario Dawson, and if nothing else, you have to admit Randy Quaid is funny: the character would have been much different in someone else's hands.  I'll have to admit I thought it was Terry O'Quinn (\"Lost\": John Locke), which made even funnier at the time, but it's a good job done.\n\nHonestly, Eddie Murphy and Rosario Dawson feel a little big for their roles, but the story is good: a former smuggler turns legitimate business owner has to find the mob boss behind the people trying to kill him.\n\nWhile I do think this is an average movie, it is solid, and I don't think I would go changing a lot to it.

            "content": "Being one of the worse box office bombs ever isn't a good start really is it. Yet to look at the trailer, the sci-fi fantasy aspect and the films title you could be fooled into thinking this might not be too bad. The title is pretty sweet if you ask me, definitely an 80's movie title right there.\n\nThe plot is set in 2080 and mainly on the moon which is now called Little America. A location where gambling, girls, criminals and all things seedy are rampant, a bit like Las Vegas in the old days. Eddie Murphy is a retired smuggler who runs a nightclub on the moon and wants a quiet life, but this is all messed up when some goons come along and force Murphy out by destroying his club under the orders of a mysterious kingpin. Its now up to 'Pluto Nash' to find out why, who is the man behind it all and try to get his club back, or what's left of it.\n\nI think the first issue with the film are the visuals. The film is oldish but not that old and unfortunately the CGI effects are pretty poor. Shots of the moon, moving vehicles, the lunar surface and of course Little America just look average and obviously CGI. When we close in on the urban areas the sets aren't too bad in design but again its terribly obvious its all sets. It all looks like a very mediocre attempt at a 'Blade Runner-esque' grimy neon lit urban district. The colour palette doesn't really help with everything being grey and boring, yes I know its the moon and the moon is typically grey but come on. There were some nice 50's-esque designs on some buildings and vehicles though, there was that element throughout the film but it still felt drab and lifeless, virtually black and white.\n\nThen you have all the interior sets, design and costumes...its all grey!! everything is grey! flippin' eck!. Not only that but the interior designs look so dated, like its all been reused from a 60's TV sci-fi show. I understand that doesn't necessarily make it bad, there are plenty of examples where films have deliberately gone down the homage route or retro design/vibe which can work wonders giving a great charm factor. The problem here is the film had a massive budget and you wonder what they actually used it on.\n\nTake the robot character played by Quaid (and the maid robot character). What they have done is simply apply a lot of makeup to Quaid to give him a doll-like appearance, then he merely acts out the robot role. Now again this can be done and it can work but probably best in low budget films that have little choice. In a big production it just tends to feel lackluster, the maid robot was the same but dressed up in a sexy French number as if that makes it more acceptable. I did quite like the 50's sci-fi sense I got from Quaid's robot though, like a butch Robbie the Robot in human form...kinda hehe.\n\nWhilst watching I also found the plot to be a tad confusing really, or at least it didn't make much sense because it was all a muddle of grey. There are a lot of character names flying about here, a lot of seemingly pointless stuff, aimless boring dialog and not much action believe it or not. We just move from one cheap looking grey set to the next with little to laugh, disappointing seeing as its supposedly a Murphy sci-fi action romp.\n\nBut is it? you think it is but its not really, its more like a 1950's nightclub murder noir homage, 'Harlem Nights' in space perhaps. I must admit to thinking of 'Total Recall' at times whilst watching, it has that kind of vibe going on, minus all the excellent action and blood of course. Do I get the feeling this was made and acted the way it was on purpose?...was it?! I'm not sure, I'd like to think that but deep down I really doubt it. I just think it was a poorly executed movie which had potential to become a bit of a classic. I can see why people might enjoy bits of it like Quaid's cheesy robotic performance and the minor visual gags dotted throughout, but end of the day this really feels like its trying to achieve what 'The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai' achieved.\n\nI'm still not really sure whether or not this film was intentionally made like a low budget sci-fi B-movie for artistic reasons, or it just came out that way. The more I think about it, this might have worked much better as a short TV series, it certainly has the look and feel.",

There were many boring parts throughout that just had one-dimensional people and one note acting and bland dialogue that nobody will ever remember for longer than a week. I didn't even think they were trying to be funny most of the time because you are provided with lots of forgettable talk scenes and when the movie tries to bring you laughs, it fails and you are just sitting in your seat with a blank look on your face waiting for at least one decent joke to be presented. The consensus is exactly right when it says that Eddie Murphy was on autopilot because it seemed like he wasn't even trying to give a good performance here and he was going through the motions hoping that this film would be successful so he could receive a big paycheck and look what the results were in the end for this movie, this is difinitely one of his worst films ever. I however give the movie one star because I thought the effects in the movie were decent and the sets looked good, it's just everything else that brings the movie down on a lot of levels. 2002 had to be a rough year for him for also being in other disappointing films like Showtime and I Spy.

The script creates situations where characters are shooting at each other and there should be some tension or at least excitement but you won't care about the characters and there aren't any big action setpieces that will get your blood pumping. It's so bad it's not even fun to make fun of the film while you're watching it so there's nothing to recomend here unless you want bragging rights so you can tell your friends how bad it was.

It just might be the worst value for money though, with a reported budget topping 100M and a box-office of less than 5 it makes Jonah Hex look like a wise investment.\r\nBut despite this it is more sad than bad.\r\n\r\nI can't possibly see where they thought the laughs were going to come from... I can't fathom which parts were supposed to be entertaining... Worst of all I can't really see where the money was spent...\r\n\r\nI just sincerely hope it wasn't Randy Quaid's salary.\r\n\r\nPluto Nash was made by the same guy that made Tremors which is the inverse if Pluto Nash, a low budget / high entertainment affair that is remembered fondly by all that have seen it. Pluto Nash wants to be quirky, cool, edgy, funky and hip but is really none of these things.\r\n\r\nIt is 2080 and the Moon has been made hospitable for humans. Pluto Nash (Eddie Murphy) is the guy who everyone on Earth's satellite adores - except the bad guys who want to force him to sell his bumpin' club to them.\r\n\r\nAfter a run in leaves his club a smouldering pile of rubble (like this film) Nash sets off with waitress Dana (Rosario Dawson - who obviously spent her paycheck on implants after filming ended) and his faithful robot Bruno (Randy Quaid).\r\n\r\nThe trio traverse the moon trying to lay low out of the gunsights of the bad guys while working towards finding who is ultimately responsible for their situation. Along the way they encounter many recognisable faces that add nothing to the film, Jay Mohr, Peter Boyle, Pam Grier, John Cleese and Alec Baldwin among others.\r\n\r\nI think the aim was for Nash to be cool and likable, Dana the cute love interest and Bruno the comic relief.\r\nAll fail. As does everything else in the film.\r\n\r\nBut again Pluto Nash is as harmless as it is pointless, unlike the braincell shattering Tank Girl it made me want to sleep more than vomit - admittedly neither is an endorsement for the film - but the issue remains how could something cost so much look so ordinary?\r\n\r\nNow I know how the Miami Heat must feel.\r\n\r\nA big budget light comedy set on the moon and featuring its own fading star in Murphy was never going to be a big hit. This can't be the fault of director Ron Underwood but the big-wigs who greenlit it and opened the coffers. The absolute ceiling for this film was Demolition Man, itself decidedly average. The floor was Tank Girl, which Pluto managed to avoid but just barely.\r\n\r\nNow you tell me; is a ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR investment worth making for a film that at best could end up mediocre?\r\n\r\nFinal Rating - 3.5 / 10. Pluto Nash sucks, but it is isn't the end of the world... unless you happened to be the one who covered the budget.\r\n\r\nIf you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com for over 800 reviews and plenty more good stuff...",

It's nowhere near the disaster that critics and box office receipts would have you believe, in fact, it's a much better film than either Norbit or any of Murphy's live-action kiddie flicks.  What was it that worked for me?  Murphy wisely brings his leading man charm to the role, Rosario Dawson is an appealing leading lady and she shares a nice screen chemistry with her co-star.  I also loved Randy Quaid's bizarre yet tone perfect performance as Murphy's robotic bodyguard.  I had a lot of fun with this one.  Definitely look for this to develop a cult following.

Pluto is just not big or dynamic enough of a character to carry on an entire film. an owner of a night club seriously? The second is the fact that the story arch has so little happening, build up,tension or little moments where we can just rest and get to know the characters. Strangely enough there's no time for rest and there's nothing happen at the same time so how is this even possible?, well its possible with this film. \r\n\r\nthe musical score was actually quite nice this however leads to yet another problem the score is too good for its film, theirs all this grand music but whats happening on screen is so mediocre that you feel the film is forcing you to feel these emotion and that there calling you stupid if your not feeling them.\r\n\r\nOne could go on and on about this film so ill end with these facts, its flat, uninspired, forced, soulless, unadventurous, dumb, and most importantly unfun or  unfunny they should have studied the movie Galaxy Quest a little closer that was a film that did science fiction comedy right.",

With production values so garish you thought they were used in video games of that era, \"Pluto Nash\" decides to cover it up by- just adding more layers of bad effects! The plot was like if they took Total Recall and put it on the moon and subtracted the violence and Arnold out and called it a comedy. If that's not enough the final plot twist comes across quite bafflingly. Other problems are resolved with the 'Batman shark repellant' method. Basically if we haven't told you about it, we have a solution anyway to get out of it, that we'll just make up with a new term or special effect and hope you'll agree. Don't get me wrong \"Pluto Nash\" is entertaining if you like albinos, a robot with down syndrome, and... Eddie Murphy. Sad thing is.. He's made worse films for less money!",

Apparently, the screenplay was stuck in Hollywood limbo for nearly 20 years waiting to be greenlit, perhaps it should have stayed there.\nI don't know who it's supposed to appeal too, it's seemingly meant to be a futuristic update/spoof of 30's gangster movies but it's too childish for adults and will probably go over the heads of kids. \nEddie Murphy plays Pluto Nash, a nightclub owner on the moon who becomes Mafia enemy #1 when he refuses to sell his club so they can build a casino in it's place. He goes on the run with waitress/singer Rosario Dawson & robot bodyguard Randy Quaid.  Many fine talents are also on the cast list but each and every performance is just embarrassing. The effects look cheap and some of the sets look as though they were filmed in someone's garage.\nIt would be interesting to know how this movie cost $100 million (to think at least 50 better films could have been made with the same amount).

[i]The Adventures of Pluto Nash[/i] (2002)\nDirector: Ron Underwood\n \nBudget: $100,000,000\nGross: $4,411,102 - or 4.4% of the budget.\n \nNow, finally, we have a movie on this Flops countdown of sorts that is just...boring....\n \nEddie Murphy, Rosario Dawson, Jay Mohr, and Randy Quaid all star in one of the most boring movies to possess a mildly interesting premise in the history of the world. Joe Pantoliano and an African-American albino fellow round out the cast. Nobody told any of them that they should try to be funny, apparently. Because they all just prove to be really, really boring.\n \nThe movie starts off interestingly enough. I forget how, though. After sitting through the entire thing, I don't remember too much of anything about the plot, or the characters, or the dialogue. Other than that it was bland, inoffensive, and not funny at all.\n \nPam Grier cameos as Pluto's mom. I think she's supposed to be funny. John Cleese and Luis Guzman come close to dimpling my cheeks, but every time the camera cuts to what I like to refer to as the 'enwhitened' Eddie Murphy - this passive, unconcerned feeling overtakes me. My eyes glaze over until Rosario shows back up. Although even she isn't that hot in this.\n \nAnd who's the super-mega-evil crime lord boss keepin' Pluto down this whole time? It's not James Rebhorn - nope. It's Eddie Murphy as a Pluto Nash clone.\n \nYes. The villain is a clone of the protagonist. They fight, they're wearing the same thing, everyone's confused, someone asks Pluto a question only he would know - or something similar...\n \nEveryone lives happily ever after in Pluto's new nightclub. The end. I'm literally about to fall asleep at work as I type this. This film redefines 'stultifying.' And this [b]still[/b] isn't worse than [i]The Stupids[/i]. Wow. \n \nI hate this movie. $100 million dollars could feed a lot of people, but instead, we get this. \n \n[b]1/10. An Absolute Crime Against Humanity[/b]. \n \n[u]Interesting Trivia?[/u] Not a whole lot. Let's see...\n \n1. Eddie Murphy was paid 20 million dollars for this movie, which didn't even make back but a quarter of HIS SALARY.\n2. [i]Starship Dave[/i] - coming soon to a theater near you. Eddie Murphy plays a human spacecraft. And nobody learned anything from this. \n \nAnyway, here's a list of the films to make less than 10% of their budget back that I haven't seen:\n \n[i]Alex Rider: Operation Stormbreaker[/i]\n[i]Basic Instinct 2[/i]\n[i]Bee Season[/i]\n[i]Bloodrayne[/i]\n[i]The Bridge of San Luis Rey[/i]\n[i]The Caveman's Valentine[/i]\n[i]Cradle Will Rock[/i]\n[i]Dirty[/i]\n[i]D-Tox[/i]\n[i]The Game of Their Lives[/i]\n[i]Heaven's Gate[/i]\n[i]It's All Gone Pete Tong[/i]\n[i]Lolita [/i](1997)\n[i]Love's Labour's Lost[/i]\n[i]Manderlay[/i]\n[i]Mimi's First Time[/i]\n[i]Monument Ave.[/i]\n[i]My Big Fat Independent Movie[/i]\n[i]No Good Deed[/i]\n[i]Nomad[/i] - which made .002% of it's budget back, which I think is pretty terrible.\n[i]The OH in Ohio[/i]\n[i]Pirates[/i] (Polanski)\n[i]Ride with the Devil[/i]\n[i]Scorched[/i]\n[i]Shade[/i]\n[i]Slow Burn[/i]\n[i]A Sound of Thunder[/i]\n[i]The Statement[/i]\n[i]Swept Away [/i](2002)\n[i]Town & Country[/i]\n[i]Waterloo[/i]\n[i]Zyzzyx Road[/i] - which made .0015% of its budget back. Which is officially the LOW point. It made exactly [b][u]$30.00[/u][/b]",

It landed with a resounding thud. The production budget was more than $100 million. The movie grossed less than $5 million domestically. Ouch. The film has a terrific supporting cast, including Rosario Dawson, Peter Boyle, Pam Grier, John Cleese and Jay Mohr. The premise concerned Murphy's character searching the universe for the culprit who destroyed his intergalactic nightclub. A repeated joke in the trailer about Hillary Clinton's face being on American currency sealed the deal. Nothing about the film was funny and it was a terrible idea to begin with.",

It wasn't because of the cheesy acting (which is standard for many of these Bruckheimer-inspired \"blockbusters\"), it wasn't because of the sci-fi theme, it wasn't anything actually about the movie. It was the premise. For some reason, I just don't really care about another night-club/theme-park/restaurant/gym/random-building owner who is getting bought out by the faceless conglomerate.\n \n The plot has been done a thousand times, and a thousand times better, but Pluto Nash came off to me as a sincere movie. I mean sincere, like they really put some thought and stayed up late nights to work out all those small details that make the movie worth watching. Pacing is also decent, with fresh action and situations keeping the movie moving. Static, cliched characters just add to that kind of cheesy vibe going through out the movie, which I wasn't sure whether it was purposeful camp or embarrasing seriousness.\n \n Either way, Pluto Nash is a cliched but acceptable little romp through space.",

It goes before they orginal into how the met and then starts to fill in some of the holes in the orginal.\r\n\r\nThe orginal cast is back, Matthew Brodrick plays Simba again. Nathan Lane does the voice of Timon and Ernie Sabella is Pumbaa. Natahan Lane if I had to guess who the voice was I would without a doubt say Billy Crystal, the first time you watch this or the first 2 Lion Kings without knowing who the actor is you would think the same. They sound ALOT alike. Theres not much you can say about these types of movies. This movie has more comedy then the others because well the only ones that made the other movies have some what of humor to it is Timon and Pumbaa. Bradley Raymond which I have nothing good to say about him so I'll leave it at that. Tom Rogers wrote the screenplay and same goes with him just like Bradley. \r\n\r\nThe way I see it is if your going to review movies, dont just review certain genres, pick a variety of movies, my mom wanted to see it so that was another reason I got it. But, its not a bad movie, its not one you would catch me watching over and over and over. For a kids movie its decent, as all kids movies they slip some adult humor in there that will go right over the kids heads. Either that or they think it means something entirely different then it does. Anyways, I wouldn't go rent this movie, if it comes on HBO then sure why not go and check it out. \r\n\r\n[SIZE=4][U][B]The Adventues of Pluto Nash [/B] [/U] [/SIZE] \r\n\r\nThis movie is a futuristic movie about a man who is struggling to keep some guys from buying the club that he owns, which is the best on the planet...or umm..technically moon. \r\n\r\nRon Underwood directed this HORRIBLE movie, which he has some good movies like Tremors and City Slickers and I won't go no further. Seeing no others were any good or I havent seen because they look stupid as this one did, but it was on HBO today and I was bored, so i watched it. Neil Cuthbert wrote the script, also he wrote Mystery Men, a movie that I think will suck but I do want to see. \r\n\r\nEddie Murphy adds quite a bit of comedy but that doesnt help with the storyline, or any of the TERRIBLE ACTING. Eddie Murphys acting wasnt that great as he can be, he had good jokes but not the acting. Randy Quaid had a few good moments. Theres some pretty good actors in it like Jay Mohr, Joe Pantaliano, Alec Baldwin has a cameo. You got John Cleese, Luis Guzman. Altogether theres 4 hilarious comedians,but that didnt help out ANYTHING. \r\n\r\nYou want a few laughs sure why not watch the movie, but the laughs arent worth it, they are limited. This is barely HBO materieal for when you're really bored. If you havent noticed I got 4 classifications I put my movies in: 1) Theatrical, 2) Rental, 3)HBO, 4)NEVER EVER WATCH THIS MOVIE (AKA-House of the Dead). Die-hard Eddie Murphy fans check it out, but his career is dropping, hes getting more of a kids person, like Dr. Dolittle, Daddy Day Care, The Haunted Mansion, which all were good except Haunted Mansion which I won't watch because it looks terrible. Anyways go with what you think.\r\n\r\n[U][B][SIZE=6]Movie News [/SIZE] [/B] [/U] \r\n\r\n[U][B][SIZE=4]Robert Rodreguez got people in mind for 'Sin City'[/SIZE][/B][/U]\r\n\r\nThe amazing director Robert Rodriquez has targeted a few big stars to star in his next movie called 'Sin City' an adapatation of the graphic novel series by Frank Miller.\r\nThe cast he has in mind is: Leonard DiCaprio, Bruce Willis, Elijah Wood, Mickey Rourke, Brittany Murphy, Kate Bosworth and Jamie King. Some are signed on some are in talks and some just recieved the offer. Benicio Del Tory and Maria Belo's names are floating around as well. The film will film shortly, and will be about 3 intertwining vignettes revoling around a dark set of characters that call the fictional corrupt town home.",

A movie that defines a generation and wins tons and tons of awards for its wit, its profoundness, and its heart.\n \nThe Adventures of Pluto Nash is not one of those movies. \n \nGod, GOD! This movie sticks on ice. \n \nEddie Murphy plays the title character, a man who owns a nightclub on the moon in the far future who is being pressured to sell his club to lunar gangsters so they can turn it into a casino. I guess it\u0092s fitting that this movie takes place on the moon since both are so vacuous. \n \nThis movie is about as fun as three months of math camp, about as funny as as watching a kid in a wheelchair get hit by a car, and if you\u0092re stupid enough to spend eight bucks to see this horrible thing, you should immediately loose your right to vote. \n \nIt\u0092s just incomprehensible how a movie this bad could be made in the first place. I mean, didn\u0092t anyone see any red flags with this thing sometime during its development? \n \nBoy, this movie is rank. Comparing it to any other bad movie would be doing the other bad movie a severe injustice and I would probably get sued for libel if I did. \n \nLet\u0092s just say that The Adventures of Pluto Nash deserved to loose every penny of the 90 million it lost on its disastrous opening weekend. \n \nI\u0092ve got to stop going to these kind of movies just to see if they\u0092re as bad as everyone says they are.",
