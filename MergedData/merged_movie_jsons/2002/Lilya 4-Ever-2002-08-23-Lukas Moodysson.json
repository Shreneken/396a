            "content": "Director Lukas Moodysson has achieved a film that is so moving that it is hard to forget it after leaving the theater. Images come back into one's mind about this story about this girl. The tragedy of her life is something to be shocked and alarmed.To think there are out there, in the so-called civilized world, people that take advantage of girls like Lilja is mind boggling. Lilja's mother has to be one of the worst monsters ever presented in a film. This woman abandons her 16 year old daughter because she has found a meal ticket with a man that will probably end up leaving her as well.Lilja is beautifully portrayed by Oksana Akinshina. The actress and her character disappear in front of your eyes. The story is very true as thousands of naive girls are exported from what it was the old Soviet Union to other countries in order to force them into prostitution. This story is constantly in the news, yet more and more young girls are duped into going abroad with the promise of highly paid jobs that exist only for the people who exploit them.Her only friend is Volodya, also a very sad boy who is thrown out of his own house by an abusive father. Volodya and Lilja form a bond as they cling to one another. The little boy is street wise; he knows the fate that awaits Lilja in Sweden. Their friendship is the only thing they both have.The sad part of the film is the realization that so called \"normal\" and perfectly \"respectful\" people are the same ones that brutalize these children. They use Lilja to satisfy their sexual appetites, then discard her like yesterday's trash. To know that there are people like that in our society is a very sad commentary about our world.Contrary to what many people have commented about the film, I thought that in spite of the tragedy of Lilja's and Volodya's lives, it had a very positive ending because both are free to run around in a better place together, which is not a luxury most of us have on our time in this planet.Mr. Moodysson gives us a film that will shock; he dares to go where others wouldn't. A job well done..",

            "content": "I wasn't surprised by how perfect this film is from the first second to the last, since it's directed by Lukas Moodysson. Different than Tillsammans and Fuckin \u00c5m\u00e5l in style, but still absolutely fascinating. I could find only one minor flaw, which is Lilya's make-up after the fall. But everything else was wonderful. I hadn't heard of Oksana Akinshina before, but I have a strong feeling I will in the near future. She's really good. I was also amazed by the acting of the little boy.The frames come so strong that you start to empathize with Lilya after some point. By the end of the film, I was feeling like she was my sister and I wanted to knock those procurers' heads off. I've heard the plot is based on a true story of a Lithuanian girl. I think it's not based on one single true story, it's rather a blend of several true stories. There are many Lilyas, Natalias, Annas out there who are suffering a similar fate. It's so very sad to see how those innocent girls grow into prostitutes just because they're born in some particular country.Anyone with a heart will be touched and anyone with a taste on movies will be stunned by this movie. I'll buy the DVD as soon as it's available. It's a must have for any collection. One of the rare films I would watch more than once. Total 10.",

            "content": "I've said it before and I'll say it again: the best movies never get the attention that they deserve. Take for instance this \"Lilja 4-ever\". It has never been in any large movie theater and is only shown on festivals or on specialized TV stations that broadcast more non-commercial movies. That's also how I got to see it. I knew about this movie, but had never been able to give it a try, until two days ago when it was finally shown on national television.Lilja is a 16 year old Estonian girl who will move with her mother and her mother's new boyfriend to the USA. But when it's about time to leave, her mother tells her that she can't come with them right now. She will have to stay for a while, following them to the USA afterward and until then her mother will send her money. But once they are gone, it quickly gets clear that they have abandoned Lilja and don't want to see her ever again. She doesn't really have anyone to take care of her and has only one real friend, the young boy Volodja. Completely out of money, she decides to sell the only thing that she has left, her body. She picks up older men in a disco until one day she meets Andrej, a nice boy of her own age. She falls deeply in love with him and when he tells her that she can come with him to Sweden to find a well-payed job and a beautiful apartment so she can start an entire new life far away of all the misery, she is convinced that for once and for all her luck has changed...Just after I saw the movie, I went to bed to get some sleep, but the entire movie just kept spooking through my head all the time, keeping me awake for hours. Even now, I'm still thinking about the horrible faith of that poor girl. That has a lot to do with the excellent acting of course. Oksana Akinshina is a complete stranger to me, but her performance was so incredibly good and so believable, that you might easily forget that you are watching a movie instead of a real life documentary. Artyom Bogucharsky as Volodya, Pavel Ponomaryov as Andrej, Liliya Shinkaryova as Lilja's aunt,... None of them is famous or has played in many other movies, but one by one, they play their roles as if they have never done anything else in their entire lives.\"Lilja 4-ever\" isn't exactly a movie that will make you happy. I would even say that its story will leave you behind completely devastated, but will also keep you thinking about Lilja for days after you've seen it. That's what happened to me and that's something that I haven't experienced too often yet. If you are strong enough to cope with the hard reality, then you should definitely give this movie a try. In my opinion there is only one appropriate rating for a movie like this one and that is 10/10!!!",

            "content": "The movie is extremely sad & hard to watch, cause of its unbelievably realistic picture of poverty, humiliation & depression in which the vast majority of people in the former USSR republics live, including here in Russia. The minority of those who have still managed to keep being human beings in this mess is surrounded & slowly devastated by demoralised animals, created by the decades of communist reign. The realism of the picture is overwhelming & scary. It is so unexpected that a Swedish director have managed to see all the sadness, corruption, violence & immorality of post-USSR space much more clearly than any Russian director ever will. Probably, it is because most people here in Russia see the hell which is going on around them as a normal thing. That's why we need movies such as this - to face the truth, we are so trying to escape in everyday life. Plus, the film exposes the problem of human traffic in such true-to-life manner, it is painful. Worth watching for former USSR citizens, in order to wake-up & realize how degenerate they're becoming. Worth watching for foreigners in order to understand how the 99% of people in Russia & other post-soviet countries live, outside the glamorous & fake facades of Moscow city.",

            "content": "During this movie I felt more and more sorry for Lilja (Oksana Akinshina), a girl from the former Soviet Union. As the viewer you know what will happen with the poor girl because it seems so logical, but from her point of view it is just a great opportunity that turns out to be something completely different. First her mother leaves her to go to America with a new husband. Lilja thinks she will travel after her mother some time later, but that is not going to happen. Her only friend is Volodya (Artyom Bogucharsky), a young boy she hangs out with.Then she meets a boy who says he likes her. He invites her to come to Sweden with him, start a life together. She has to go first, he will travel after her, again, some time later. Volodya does not agree with it, but she goes anyway. Arriving in Sweden she is picked up by an older man, put in an apartment locked from the outside, and we understand that the boy will not travel after her. The next day the man brings Lilja another man; she must have sex with him. Finally it is clear for her, sort of, as it was for us all along.I guess there are thousands and thousands of stories like this and realizing that Lilja's story is even more sad. The way certain people use unhappiness of others is terrible and 'Lilja 4-ever' shows us in a realistic way how easy it basically is. If you are as unhappy as Lilja every opportunity seems fantastic.There are two scenes that you will remember. The first shows us Lilja's face when the men are on top of her. She just lies there, helpless, without any reason to live. The second shows us the faces of the men that are on top of her. This montage lets us see the ugliness of those people, what kind of animals the world knows. 'Lilja 4-ever' is a sad movie, but a good movie. Although we probably know that things like this happen, it is not bad to realize that from time to time. 'Fucking \u00c5m\u00e5l' director Lukas Moodysson makes sure we do that with his movie.",

It seems like he's on its way to achieve it as film after film Moodyson seems to find a subject that is shocking but stays a part of the society we cann't deny. \"Lilja 4-ever\" puts us back in some godforgotten village that used to be the powerful USSR. A place at where nothing really happens and where the youth just has to face violence and drugs (cheap medicine like syrup against coughing). Lilja is left alone by her mother who immigrates to the US and how much she defends, Lilja ends up as a childwhore.

            "review_title": "Human Betrayed and Sold",
            "content": "This is about the buying and selling of human beings. Lilja is in a hopeless situation, she is betrayed and then sold. The men who sell and buy her are not concerned with who she is, or why she is there. They don't want to know. They do their business and don't ask questions.There is not much doubt this could be a true story. Moodysson wrote the script after reading about a young girl, an eastern European refugee, under strange circumstances throwing herself off a bridge in Malm\u00f6. \"Sex slavery\", trafficking, is out of sight, out of mind for most of us, but is still very much in effect. And most of the people on the planet live very hard lives. The buying and selling of people is something that we all live with. We all sell ourselves to anonymous corporations, we have to do it, it is in the fabric of our societies. Liljas sale is on another scale of exploitation, of course, but it is also an extreme of what capitalism effectively means. Everything is a commodity.The movie tells the story of of a young girls destruction by brutal socioeconomic and individual forces, both objectively and subjectively. While there is no big drama, the story is told from the perspective of Lilja. There are a few weaknesses, the portrayal of Lilja starts with things going bad, and then they turn even worse. We don't get to know Lilja outside of hardships, which probably enables us to differentiate ourselves from her. Also its a bit over-explicit in the depiction of the adult betrayal of Lilja. What if, for example, Liljas mother hadn't disappeared, the way she does in the movie, would that make the story much less tragic?Otherwise, its a film that people \"should see\", there should be a 100 of these kind of movies made for every new, strained, meaningless, \"J.Lo is pretty and wants romance\" or \"Arnie is strong, rightfully angry and wants to kill somebody\", film. Instead of the other way around, the way it is today.",

            "content": "It is not often that everyone is quiet after a movie at the cinema. Some were crying, others did not know how to act, ending up staring out in to the emptiness. For me, nothing was the same after I did leave the cinema. I know that it sounds like a clich\u00e9, but I tell you, it is not. Some of these people were laughing before they sat down, but the haunting beginning of the movie did wake everyone up. Every day you do wake up, when you are working you do hurry away; maybe you take your children with you to leave them at the nearby kindergarten. If it is a holiday, maybe you are of to meet some friends. In the evening you come home, you are cooking and eating. Maybe you do sit down with your wife and kids watching a good TV-show. When the night comes, you are wishing your child's a good night's sleep before you go to bed. It is not easy for you to know what is going on inside the apartment of your neighbour. The time that pass from the beginning to the end is the time the director Lukas Moodysson have to convince you that the reality is not as good as you may think, or maybe you already know, all to well.\nThe reality of leading character Lilja becomes slowly a part of your reality. You can choose to see Lilja in two different points of view. You can see her as a part of a fairly tale, and nothing more, than her life story will disappear after the movie in your shower. Or you may see her as she is; a picture of what life can do with people who are not as lucky as you, a picture of other girls in the same situation as she. The great acting of the 15 year old Russian actress Oksana Akinsjina makes it possible. I did almost forget that she is not Lilja when I did see the movie, it is heartbreaking when she is crying, and when she is happy her smile is the most wonderful you have seen that day. But a few minutes later you may see pain in her eyes.  If you are thinking about what is happing in the movie, you will understand her reactions. When it is painful then she cries without hope, when it is too painful she doesn't seems to react at all (exactly like you!) and you don't need to imagine to feel the pain she have inside.\nThe one that will become more close to her than anyone else is the street kid and male leading character Volodja act by the 12 year old Artiom Bogutjarskij (his first movie). I have worked with street children and his acting is very authentic. When everything falls apart for Lilja, Volodja becomes her last hope, he is never leaving her in her mind he is always close. He is the one who is always there, the one that catches her when she falls. Lukas said in an interview that Volodja are a shape of Jesus in the end you will understand. These parts are telling about the dreams of Lilja, whom makes it easier to understand her vision of hope. Lukas is the best Swedish director now and maybe of all time. The integrity of his actors is intact, that he manages to do it in a movie like this shows how good as a director he is. He has a moving respect for Oksana and the way he cares about her integrity is the thing that makes this movie worth looking. His manuscript is trustworthy and don't have any illogical lacks. Nothing is darker than it could be in the reality. All characters are three dimensional and even the evil characters are human, even the victims are not just victims.You may wonder if the reality is this dark. In a article in a Swedish newspaper Lukas Moodyson told that he had spoken with a social worker and he was told that some mothers do sell their own kids for 1 \u00a3 to the sex industry. Though the movie is fictional and not about her, many of the memorable things that are happening to Lilja in the movie did happen to Dangoule Rasalaite from Latvia between the 17th September 1999 and the 10th January 2000. Lukas read about her in an article. The reality is always worse than the fiction.The young actors do carry the weight of the movie with grace. Their acting against each other is moving, it is a special chemistry between them. Lukas has the gift of finding the right persons for the characters in all is movies, and Lilja 4-ever is not an exception. Last Monday Lilja forever won 5 out of 6 gold beagles (the most important Swedish film award) it was nominated to (Artiom was also nominated for best performance by an actor). The awards it won were for best movie, best picture, best manuscript, best direction, and the most important of them all, best performance by an actress. Trafficking is the third biggest illegal industry in the world; it makes this movie so important. Lukas Moodysson and Oksana did manage to wake up this nation, to show that our reality is not as good as we thought. We can see it in the reactions of the cinema public, how people are talking about it afterwards, and in the newspapers. The Swedish government are working for the possibility to show this movie in schools all over the former Sovjet Union. Lukas has said that if this movie can convince one girl to make other decisions than Lilja and to many other young girls; this movie was worth making.This movie is worth more than all the awards it has won and all the awards it will win. This movie can change your point of view, it is that message of hope it brings.\n/Josef Lundstr\u00f6m",

However, Lilja is left alone, without money or family in a very poor apartment. She spends her time with her only friend, the rejected boy Volodya (Artyom Bogucharsky). Lilja begins to prostitute in a nightclub to survive, where she meets a young man, Andrei (Pavel Ponomaryov), who seduces her and invites Lilja to move with him to Sweden with a promise of a honest job and lodging. When she arrives in Sweden, reality is not exactly as dreamed.\"Lilja\" is a heartbreaking family drama, very realistic and one of the saddest film I have seen. The story of Lilja, a needy girl that begins to sell her body to survive, reflects the situation of many children in Third World countries. Brazil, for example, is combating the sexual tourism through campaigns, but unfortunately still there are many children prostituting themselves. The way Lilja is treated, like cattle and sent from one man to another, is disgusting. The impressive performance of Oksana Akinshina deserved a nomination to the Oscar. The metaphor with angels is the beautiful part of this awesome and pessimist movie. \"Lilja\" is one of the best movies I have ever seen. In the end of the credits, there is an important dedicatory.

            "content": "I like films that make one think. They don't answer one's questions, but rather help one find the answers for oneself. Such films are so valuable because they explore the human mind and personality. Everyone has been involved in situations when one needs to know what the person in front of him or her is thinking. Lilja 4-ever is a film that leads us in the dark world of a beautiful girl who has not yet grown enough to face the hardships of life, let alone the hardships of life in a place like that she lives in. Although the film is much acclaimed because it raises the problem of human traffic, it achieves much more than that. It raises the problems of human selfishness, betrayal, dignity, hopelessness, lie. It explores love and friendship. It conveys a simple but incredibly important message - we are those who are responsible.What fascinates me about European cinema is that it explores in great depth the human personality. Lilja 4-ever employs an ordinary script and is directed in a way that ,at the time of watching, one does not, at all, think about the director's work. Thus, one can concentrate entirely on the plot, on the development of the characters and their stories. For that, I congratulate Lukas Moodysson.Critics acclaim the film because it concerns the problem of human traffic. However, much of the film focuses on Lilja's life before she is forced into prostitution. During that time, Moodysson carefully explains why many people end up leading such terrible lives. She is an innocent girl who knows almost nothing about life. In an unbelievably short period of time she is abandoned by her mother, thrown out by her aunt, betrayed by her friends, cynically humiliated by her teacher. The only hope she has is her dream that one day she would be able to go to a beautiful country where she would meet hospitable people and have many opportunities. She is striving for happiness and tries to find it anywhere she can. Unfortunately, the only people who offer their help are little Volodja and a deceitful man. Volodja is the little boy who finds the angel inside Lilja. Ironically, the only person who truly likes and wants to help her is incapable of doing so. His life is as miserable as hers.Lilja is abandoned, left to starve, raped, forced into prostitution, and yet not one of these moments disturbed me as much as the smile on her face when she is lied by a person in whom she sees hope and salvation. In my opinion, that is the single strongest and most substantial moment in the whole film.Lilja 4-ever is a masterpiece in its own way. It changes perspectives ... It manages to explain how innocent and pure a prostitute's mind can be. How many of us relate words such as pure and innocent to prostitution? It urges us to be concerned, to feel responsible, and to believe in the importance of GOOD ...",

            "content": "In the former Soviet Union, 16-year old Lilya (Oksana Akinshina) lives with her mother and new boyfriend, and is excitedly awaiting a relocation to the United States. It turns out her mother doesn't want her there, and takes off with the promise of Lilya following later, leaving Lilya alone in her apartment. Her aunt then throws her out, giving her the run-down flat of a recently deceased old man, and Lilya finds herself without any money, and only the young Volodya (Artyom Bogucharskiy) as a friend. Desperate, she discovers how easy it is to make money from whoring herself out, and then meets the handsome Andrei (Pavel Ponomaryov), who invites her to live with him in Sweden. Despite Volodya's warnings, she decides to take his offer, but it soon becomes apparent that there is more to his Andrei's promises.Based on a true story of a young girl who was trafficked to Sweden only to find herself imprisoned and forced to have sex for money, director Lukas Moodysson's film is set mostly in a very grim reality. Similar both to the social realism of Ken Loach, and the relentless and uncomfortable degrading of it's lead female character that is so prominent in Lars von Trier's films, Moodysson film is certainly brutal. As Lilya (played with a tragic naivety by Akinshina) is being abused in Sweden, we are treated to a POV montage of the various perverts and abusers, sweating and breathing into the camera. We live through the whole thing through the eyes of Lilya, a character of almost operatic tragedy, who suffers for the sins of others in a country ravaged by poverty, glue-sniffing and boredom.But Moodysson wisely doesn't keep everything grim. In the final third, as Lilya suffers the most, the film often turns dream-like and fairy- tale. He introduces angels and dream sequences, as Lilya finds herself drifting through existence in an almost coma-like state, with her dreams and fantasies her only relief. These scenes (and there are only a few) are not flashy or whimsical, but are subtle and simplistic, in a similar way that Wim Wenders portrayed his angels in Wings of Desire (1987). It's a powerful tool that makes Lilya's plight all the more profound. The film plays out almost like a cruel fairy-tale, only set very much in the real world. Lilya 4-Ever is a hard film to sit through, but is rich in humanity, even though most of its characters are certainly devoid of it.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",

            "content": "The film is rather conventional, maybe clich\u00e9d to some people, in terms of storyline, but by no means any less effective about reaching out to audiences what the director wants to tell. There is a marked distinction between prostitution and child/adult sex slavery. The former is a transaction between 2 consenting parties who understand the implication of the deal (what is known as the world's oldest trade), while the latter is a crime of utmost human grothesqueness. It is almost in total contradiction to the thought that modern world has achieved civilised behaviour.The film portrays this to a very effective end. Kudos to the lead actress who brings out the desperation and tragedy of the Lilja's life with such depth. There were indeed many memorable scenes, 2 which affected me deeply were: when Viktor methodically asked Lilja for her fake passport; and when Lilja was raped in the bathroom by Viktor the very next morning. Contrast this to the optimism and happiness she felt in the Duty-Free area in the airport (no means by a shopaholic) and just when she woke up in the apartment in Sweden (although it was as about as dreary as her home in Estonia). The methodical way Viktor asked for Lilja's passport is astounding. Lilja's obviously not his first prostitute and definitely not his last; Viktor is also one of the many pimps who participates actively in this form of slavery. It is unimaginable the magnitude of this crime.The music, as well as the way the camera was handled added very much more to the film. In the opening, the music came on so loud and the camera so shaky, you almost know the film would be unbearably painful (in more ways than one).Powerful as the film is, there are some parts which are admittedly over the top. Having Lilja and Volodya play ball with wings on the roof top is quite whimsical actually. But all said, this was definitely a film worth watching.",

I discover that Lilja's story was based on the real life of a girl called Dangoule Rasalaite, and with the exception of Volodja, it is all very well accurate.Oksana Akinshina had only 15 years when she played this role,and only made one movie before, so I need to give her some applause for her work.Lilya is a teenager who loses everyone she is close to: her mom, who goes to USA to live with her boyfriend, her aunt and even her friends. The only person who cares about her is the boy Volodja. Needing to be a prostitute to live, she enters in a sub world that she will only find problems and disasters.The end is pessimistic and has a message of no hope, but is realistic and also is the reality of most girls in the same situation. Suicide is usually their only option to not be a prostitute forever.Ps: I love the song ''mein hertz brennt'' from Rammstein!",

            "content": "Lilja 4-ever is an excellently-crafted film created by and for Swedes to help stimulate public debate and redress the issue of the vulnerability of immigrant children. It's a cruel, enlightening, compelling watch for anyone in the West, but it's most definitely not a movie for escapism, it's not an After School Special, and it's a world away from the endless contemporary assault/insult of bald neocon propaganda on Anglo-American screens.Unless you're very, very dead inside, Lilja 4-ever will horrify you, move you to tears, and leave you speechless...at least in its immediate aftermath. And if you are dead inside, the implicit subject is inexorable capitalist alienation and trauma, so why not catch a representation of your own inner life on film? Maybe you can work it into a drinking game.Based on actual, turn-of-the-21st-century suicides of escaped post-Soviet child prostitutes in the suburbs of Sweden, Lilja 4-ever is a well-done drama, featuring terrific acting--especially by Oksana Akinshina and Artyom Bogucharsky. It presents moody and stark cinematography, fine script-writing, and solid direction. Lilja 4-ever is not a documentary, but its subject is relentlessly grim and real: the tragic personal results of the continued, desperate corrosion of Eastern European society and its tacit, rapaciously opportunistic exploitation in the isolated, commuter highway-bound suburbs of the West. For its success in making these links visible and cinematic, Lilja 4-ever is outstanding.I saw Lilja 4-ever when it was released in Stockholm in 2002. You can't watch this particular movie waiting for some good one-liners to repeat to the guys around the water cooler. You may not be able to identify with Lilja. You don't need to feel like she could be your girlfriend. For this movie to work, and to grasp who Lilja is, you need to be able to feel human compassion, sympathy and empathy, and to recognize and appreciate the drama in our socio-economic connections.",

But in the real world these situations do happen and far too easily. Lukas Moodysson has made a magnificent and at the same time utterly heartbreaking movie. Oksana Akinshina and Artyom Bogucharsky both deserve awards for their roles in this film. Both give performances that put to shame about 99% of any mainstream actor you care to mention. I have to admit that I was reduced to tears by both of them. And then I felt angry followed by a sense of despair at their fate. Oksana Akinshina should have a great career ahead of her if she gets offered the right roles. So far, all she has had is a part in The Bourne Supremacy. Maybe Hollywood is a little reluctant to upset their star system by using a Russian who can actually act as well as being attractive. Lilya 4 ever is not easy to watch but once you are watching, it's impossible to look away. Trafficking in children and child prostitution is a serious problem that needs to be addressed by all governments, but sadly, very few are interested in doing anything about it. Maybe if this movie got the publicity it deserves, something might happen. But don't hold your breath. Just watch this movie and cry for these victims of their circumstances and an evil trade.With the votes cast for Lilya 4 Ever it should be in the top 250, why is it being kept out?",

I had liked Moodyson's previous film, together, but the sleeve did not inspire me at all, the tale of a young Russian girl and how she befriends an 11 year old boy, nothing to get too excited about, there.Then i unleashed the juggernaut of a film into my DVD player. I wasn't really concentrating for the first few minutes, but then got drawn in by the scene where Lilya, who initially pretended that she wasn't affected by her mother leaving for America, pleads with her not to go. She cries hysterically and does not stop. It is X rated emotion and one of the most incredibly powerful scenes i have seen anywhere.We then see Lilya's position go from bad to worse. Nearly every scene is touching and has a purpose. The acting is faultless, the character development is amazing. Lilya is humiliated by everyone, her teacher, her peers, the shopkeepers, but always tries to maintain her dignity until it gets eaten away bit by bit. Brilliantly exemplified by her looking for the money that she had thrown into the bin as dirty money.This film is about betrayal and power. The betrayal of Lilya by her mother, her aunt, her supposed boyfriend and her betrayal of Volodya. It is also about Lilya's fight for power and how badly she fails. When she sells her body for the first time and gains some power we are almost relieved, at least she can buy some necessities. When she becomes a slave we are devastated. It makes the film far more effective not knowing the ending. I didn't see it coming, but like Lilya, I should have. She wants her dreams so badly she remains in denial about the reality of her situation. It shows her faith in humankind is so strong that she is not cynical about the boys motives in taking her to Sweden.I was completely shell-shocked after seeing this film and i cannot believe people aren't shouting from the rooftops imploring others to see it. Even though i cried for days after seeing this film (i'm not actually an emotional person) i wouldn't classify this as a depressing film. It makes you realize how lucky your life is, and that you must enjoy to the full every moment of freedom that you have.Bad things happen to good people. The world is unfair. Volodya gets one present in his life, a basketball from Lilya and that gets smashed by his father. Kids in the west get everything and appreciate nothing. There are psychopaths in Broadmoor, who are truly evil, who get hours of psychotherapy but Lilya's spirit lives on forever.",

            "content": "This film is both terrible and terrifying because it shows an accurate depiction of events in the real world that likely happen everyday without our knowledge of it. Moodysson does an incredible job at directing this film to create a sense of universality. This could be happening to everyone and anyone; perhaps your neighbour. your relative, or your classmate, who knows.The excellent cinematography helps in creating this universal sense, as during the montage of 'customers' we only see their faces, and not Lilja's. This is a very unique stance, and the fact that we do not see Lilja generalizes the scene to the people of the public, showing that these customers could be on top of anybody, even you. I find this montage to be very powerful because we as the audience are forced to be in this position, and so in a sense it is us that this is being done to, making us identify with the ones being trafficked.Oksana as Lilja does a wonderful job at showcasing her character's stubborn personality as well as initial innocence and naivety of the world she lives in. Her expressions, and especially her eyes are very powerful at conveying emotions. Lilja is forced to grow up in a short amount of time, and whenever one of her fantasies seem to becoming true, it gets crushed, and Oksana shows these transformations superbly. Artyom as Volodya also does a great job, and the young innocence yet wisdom his character shows is heartbreaking. As well, the strong bond between both their characters can be felt throughout the film.Additionally, the music accompaniment in the film is quite interesting. There are a lot of instances in which there is loud heavy metal music enveloping the scene. I take these scenes as ones which show Lilja's internal emotional turmoil, and though she may not necessarily seem conflicted, her behaviour may suggest otherwise. The best example would be in the ending scene when our auditory systems are hijacked by heavy metal, and the music can be seen as representing both her anger and frustration at her life situation or we as the spectator's inability to do anything.Overall, a terrifyingly realistic depiction of one case in the sex trafficking industry with universal implications created through impeccable cinematography, acting and directing.Read more movie reviews at: champioangels.wordpress.com",

The movie impressed me so much that I saw it again trying to tune myself in order to observe each little detail that might escaped me during first view. Everything in this movie is so great and well done that after second view I gave it 10 out of 10... a grade that I gave only to another movie (The Godfather I). Oksana did a demonstration of art in playing Lilja proving that she easily can beat great names as Nicole Kidman or Julia Roberts that are earning million times more and acting million times worst. Her note 10/10... sorry, 20/10.If I would compare Kill Bill vol. 1 with Lilja (as I seen Kill Bill got so high grades) I would give to Kill Bill 1,5 and to Lilja 10.Again, Europe beats the hell out of US, showing that the real art of cinema has nothing to do with having hundred of millions of $ budget and millions of special effects.",

Lilja (and Volodja also!) really penetrates in your subconsciousness as she's extremely good portrait-ed as an innocent child with it's full morality. The problem is that this child-morality is broken and sold by morally-depraved adults. And there's no one in this movie who really tries to save her from being broken and abused, as if we all were a part of this perverse system. As she cannot defend herself, as she cannot call for help, as she cannot run to anyone... the only exit is to become an angel... A Swedish-Russian movie... which deserved 10 Oscars.

            "content": "There's been so much written about this film that I approached it with trepidation. The biggest temptation is to say that Moodysson's first two films were optimistic and this is pessimistic in the extreme. However, I am not quite so sure. Whilst the action and the tone of this film are very hard hitting, there still seems to be more than a suggestion of possible happiness in death for the main characters (very optimistic, right?) I feel like starting again. On the one hand the film is very moving but I didn't feel manipulated like I do with many Hollywood movies. I felt very angry at the way everyone who exploited Lilya acted, so much so that I was ready to go out and kill the Swedish pimp (if he'd been real). But still I did feel uplifted in a bleak way by the ending. Third attempt: This bleak and depressing film will and should politicise you about the situation regarding the exploitation of children in the former Soviet Union and many other parts of the world. Go and watch the movie then do something about it. However, Moodysson is still a skillful enough director to make this more than just a depressing polemic.The acting is as near faultless as you will find anywhere. The music, as in all this director's films, perfectly matches the action. It is an important film and it has an important message but it still works as art and as a movie. It's very hard to write a meaningful review. See it.",

This movie is all about making us feel for the characters. And in that respect it's brilliant. The director, Lukas Moodysson, has an uncanny knack for bringing true emotions to the screen. This is without doubt one of the most harrowing and devastating movies I've ever seen. I saw it two days ago, and I still can't get it off of my mind.  I cried in the theater, something I haven't done since... well... probably ever. I consider myself a rather cynical moviegoer. Mostly the characters in movies don't move me very much. I just enjoy the ride and try my best to suspend disbelief. But in this movie it's simply impossible to not feel for the main characters (Lilja and Volodja). Oksana Akinshina simply I S Lilja. Her journey in a downward spiral from bad to worse into hell simply breaks your heart. Because it doesn't help telling yourself it's just a movie. Because we all know it isn't. This kind of thing is happening all around us all the time. And we, the decent ordinary citizens, simply don't care to see it or do anything about it. The movie is a must-see. Even though you'll probably be depressed for days, and well might lose some of your faith in the goodness of man. It's a 10.

This film is a revolting mix of kiddie porn and holier-than-thou sentimentalism, for people who want to feel aware, concerned and superior, but also want to get the secret thrills of the rape scenes. The scenes with Lilja and Volodna with angel wings on their backs, on the other hand, were simply beyond ridiculous. Another thing about this film that drives me up the wall is the borderline-racist way it depicts all Russians: greedy, uncaring and alcoholic. And I don't speak Russian, but I know several people who do (some of them native speakers) and those of them who've seen this film say that the Russian dialogue is totally unrealistic. I've been told that especially teenagers would never in reality talk the way they do in this movie.\nThe problem of child trafficking is real, of course, and something should be done about it. Watching this film and feeling like you've become a better person for,however, it is not the answer. One final related note: the director of this film, Lucas Moodysson, was among the figureheads of a movement for outlawing patronizing protitutes. In other words, in Sweden prostitutes are allowed by law to offer their services, but the men who hire them are committing a crime. I suppose it's possible that the people who supported the law partially believed their own claims about how it was supposed to help sex workers, especially immigrants. However, as anyone with half a brain can guess, the results were exactly the opposite: prostitution went even further underground and ruthless pimps, such as the one in Lilja 4-Ever, now have more power than ever. Prostitutes, on the other hand, are in a desperate situation: they are paid less, cannot decide for themselves the conditions in which they work and are unable to choose their own customers. The idea that someone would have the gall to make a film supposedly calling your attention to a problem, and at the same time advocating a law that makes that very problem much worse makes me sick.",

The viewer is sure that the world is cruel and inhabited by disgusting men and women. It is portrayed as in the conversation between Rocky and his son in the movie Rocky Balboa (2006): \"The world ain't all sunshine and rainbows. It's a very mean and nasty place and I don't care how tough you are it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it. You, me, or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life\".The writer and director is the Swedish Lukas Moodysson, from F*cking \u00c5m\u00e5l (Show me Love - 1998) and Tillsammans (Together - 2000). The story chronicles the life of a 16 years old Lilja (Oksana Akinshina), who lives with her mother (Lyubov Agapova) in a poor and dreary suburb somewhere in the former Soviet Union. Lilja is beautiful, rebellious, unexpectedly devout, kneeling always before her favorite photo of an angel with a child, and above all, she is naive. She and her mother would emigrate to the United States with her mother's new husband, but her dreams of a better life crumbles when she finds out that she will be left behind, under the guardianship of her aunt (Lilija Sjinkarjova), to eventually join them later. As the time passes by and she doesn't receive letters or money, there is a feeling that she was abandoned. With no help from her aunt, she is forced to move into a tiny apartment without electricity or heating. Desperate, she receives aid from Volodya (Artyom Bogucharsky), a boy of only 11 years old, her only friend. Disillusioned and broke, the girl meets and falls in love with Andrei (Pavel Ponomarjov), who offers her employment and a chance of a better life in Sweden.The work of the cameras was made in such a way that even not seeing some scenes we feel and suffer all the hardships aside with the protagonist. Using only the suggestion (the implicit feature that was given) the director reached and impacted the viewer more than if he had used explicit images. We identify ourselves in such a way with the central character that we want to warn her of the dangers in every step she takes towards her ruin. Oksana Akinshina, in the leading role, and Artyom Bogucharsky, in the supporting role, give us an interpretation worthy of take the hat off.The soundtrack was chosen to intensify the emotions conveyed in the film. It is responsible for giving voice to the characters at different times, expressing the feelings of joy, disappointment, grief, sadness, emptiness, anger, hatred and despair. The song of the German band Rammstein \"Mein Herz Brennt\" (My heart burns), which opens and practically closes the film, causes a strong initial impact, but it's heard with other ears and emotions at the end.Apart the denunciation of the tragedy that accompanied the lives of millions of people who have been abandoned to a bitter and inhuman life with the end of socialism and the break up of the USSR, in what children are the most vulnerable victims, there is also a criticism about individualism and loss of social values. The state of men without civil society is nothing else but mere war of all against all...Originally posted in: http://vikingbyheart.blogspot.com.br",

Never have I felt so moved by a film, a film that one can consider Art of the highest order. Now, even days later this film will not leave my head, its deep unsettling message always at the surface of my consciousness. The film has done its job, rather too admirably.Never have I left a cinema, totally stunned, the cinema audience during the closing credits were in total shock, there was near absolute silence which emphasized the sound of some people crying. This film was not a comfortable experience. Moodysson has punched us full in the face and we reel back in utter horror. This film makes the similar themed \"Sex Traffic\" (by Director David Yates) look like a fairytale in comparison.Moodysson, Bergmans heir apparent (with a nod from the master himself I hear) is a genius, and I do not use this word lightly. Perhaps this film is so good though he can never better it, and this will always be known as his magnus opus. It is ironic (as has been said by earlier reviewers) that this film, a true reflection of a facet of society today, was produced not by a Russian or Eastern European director (who just wouldn't \"get it\"), but by a Swedish one, and one, who is utterly perceptive to the point of genius. Whilst Bergman dealt with abstractions this guy deals totally concretely.Films like this reinforce my awareness of how much crap is spewed out of Hollywood. It makes me feel good that us Europeans produce perhaps the best intellectualized and socially relevant cinema in the world, and of course Sweden has this reputation because of the master, so it is fitting that the mantle is perhaps being passed to a worthy successor.The Acting? First rate, no criticisms here, it does not get in the way of the message, I guess in many ways that is what is important here. It looks, feels real. Too real.It is interesting that Ebert rates this only with three stars, and yet, in his review there is absolutely no criticism of this film, I believe his acceptance of this film as art of the highest order (and his disguised admiration, you know sometimes the old codger gets it right) has something to do with this. He might not like it, but he cannot help but admire it.The closing sequence with the transition from life to death (with the throwing of the ball) is utterly moving, the eloquence, beauty and incredible cinematography, words cannot describe this. We at this moment are almost one with the film, a truly frightening experience conjured by a master of his craft.Reminds me in some ways to the little known \"Liten Ida\" by Norwegian Director Laila Mikkelsen. If you can get it this film is well worth seeing, another underrated masterpiece.",

            "content": "Those who know me well will know that depressing cinema is my kind of thing. Any film that can take you on a powerful and draining experience is a film well worth seeing in my book, so when I heard about how gruelling Lukas Moodysson's third feature, Lilya 4-Ever, was I just had to seek it out. Whilst I can understand why most people would find it completely bemusing as to why someone would want to watch a film where the protagonist is put through hell, this is the kind of film I really admire when done right. Lilya 4-Ever is done right, and whilst it's by no means an easy watch, it's an important one which everyone should make time to see.The film opens to Rammstein, a heavy metal German rock band used more recently in Lars von Trier's latest near-masterpiece, Nymphomaniac. They play over a horrendous and ominous image of our hero, Lilya, running from something and covered in bruises. The entire film is a flashback which leads up to this emotive image, and it's an image which assured me that this was going to be a film to remember.Lilya 4-Ever opens with a sense of hope and optimism with Lilya looking forward to going to start a new life in America and leaving her Russian slum. However, this is quickly crushed within the first 10 minutes. Her mother abandons her and leaves her at the mercy of her hard-hearted Aunt who offers as little support as possible. Things go from bad to worse and eventually end up at the worst. Lukas does a wonderful job at immersing the audience in the world of Lilya. The raw hand-held directing is reminiscent of our own cuddly pessimist, Lars Von Trier.In fact, Lilya 4-Ever would've made a welcome replacement for The Idiots in Lars' golden hearts trilogy. The film is very much like Dancer in the Dark and Breaking the Waves in that it takes a likable and generally kind-hearted female and then the world mercilessly rips her apart. It's about as far away from Hollywood as you can get, but unfortunately this is the world we're living in. Someone, somewhere in the world is having a life like Lilya and Moodysson does a damn convincing job at portraying this.The authenticity of the film isn't least helped by 15 year-old Oksana Akinshina's stellar performance. I believed her in every frame and sometimes she just broke my heart. It was so nice to see her in those rare moments where she's smiling and laughing, and trying to make the most out of her dreadful situation. The moments when she's at her lowest are the most should-crushing, and Oksana often conveys more emotion in just one heart-breaking expression than most actors manage to do in a career.Lilya 4-Ever is an experience that is hard to forget. It didn't quite make me cry, but I'm not ashamed to admit that I welled up in more than one place. What makes the film even more crushing to watch is that you know that it's completely true and that this stuff has happened and is happening to people across the world. It's not a film you instantly forget the next day, and to me that's the mark of a truly great film. The ending is beautifully done and is powerful enough to move mountains. As I said before, Lilya isn't an easy film to watch, but very much like the equally distressing 12 Years a Slave, it has such an important message that it needs to be seen by everyone.",

            "review_title": "Multilayered and drab narrative of social misery",
            "content": "The film Lilja-4-ever is truly multilayered. It addresses prostitution, religion, parenthood, male sexism, sex with minors, sadomasochism, and decay of morals and values. The problem with so many layers is that it stems from an infirmity of purpose with the maker, which invariably leads to drab narratives. The story drags on without a clear direction. You could argue that this style allows the viewer to use his own fantasy. The consequence of this argument would be that Lilja-4-ever may secretly search clientele among mentally disturbed and deviant people. I fear that such perverse spurs may actually be damaging to society, In addition I did not enjoy the film, since my preference lies with (social) realism. Still the film is layered to such an extent, that it offers enough room to harbor my own perspective. I like to elaborate on two, namely the decay of post-Bolshevist Russia and social inheritance. The westerly countries bear a grave responsibility in having stimulated the liberal shock doctrine after the coup against Gorbachev. Michel Chossudovsky has documented how it caused the sudden collapse of the productive capacity of the former Soviet Union, estimated by some economists to be of the order of 50 percent, and ruined her economy, Under the Bolshevist system at least the basic human needs and essential social services were free and available, although second-rate by western standards. After 1991 the social conditions in Russia became similar to those in the Third World. Hospitals, theaters and museums were driven into bankruptcy. The purchasing power of the people more than halved. In many corporations wages no longer were paid on a regular basis. Organized crime soared. Perhaps the most disgusting is that lives were actually lost. According to Stiglitz between 1990 and 2000 the life expectancy diminished with four years! The film shows the social havoc that the unemployment wreaked in the families. The mother of Lilja becomes a prostitute, and the father of Volodja develops a violent attitude. You could argue that the Bolshevist system has made them defenseless, and this may be true, but the reforms ought clearly to have anticipated this fact. It seems that the Chinese road to freedom makes more sense. In Russia the shock doctrine did hardly establish any civil rights. However if you are interested in the new Russia, I would recommend to watch the documentary film \"Piter\", not Lilja-4-ever. My second perspective on the film is the social inheritance. From the start, both Lilja and Volodja have no chance, and slowly drift towards the abyss. Other persons would have seized the opportunities that of course always cross your path, but Lilja and Volodja simply lack the skills to do so. If your parents were used to safe jobs and subsequently to criminal acts, and your educational environment reflects the same lifestyle, than the idea to engage for instance in applications for hard jobs can not germinate. The fate of these kids is brought about by society, and is not due to genetic inferiority, or other right-wing neoliberal fallacies. In Europe this notion is still propagated by the socialdemocrats, and I wonder about the public attitude in the USA. It strikes me, that in the American crime series (CSI, Bones, SVU etc. etc.; in Europe they are shown in abundance on the commercial TV channels) the wrong-doers are completely dehumanized. They are devoid of values, often incorrigible recidivists, who crave for more crimes. The criminal career is depicted as a personal choice, in the liberal tradition that extols the rational citizen with his own personal responsibility. The American crime series miss the sense, that the criminal is the social reflection of our own behavior. You could praise \"Lilja-4-ever\" for emphasizing this fact. However, I would recommend the film \"Keetje Tippel\", which addresses the same issue in the Dutch society of 1900.",

It is unrelenting and you will probably only see this movie once not because it's bad but because it's so disturbing.  It wasn't made to please or entertain an audience, it was made to hit you in the guts and puts things in perspective.

That's the very start of the movie, and trust us, it doesn't get any more uplifting from there. Even the brief moments of lightness are dampened somewhat by knowing that this is just the eye of the storm and that things are about to get real bad again, and they do.Would we recommend Lilya 4-Ever?

No sentimentality as far as the eye can see. For me as a Swede, one of the film's strengths is also the absence of familiar acting faces. Lilja's fate is the main core and it simply is an unforgettable drama. So is Akinshina's performance. 7 out of 10 from Ozjeppe.",

The people are mean, poor drunkards, the scenery consists of gray concrete blocks and there is nothing to do but smell glue. Well, I'm from Finland, and I've visited Estonia, Ukraine and Russia and I have to say that the movie does its portrayal jokingly and lovingly. Obviously there are all kinds of depressing situations all over the world and I don't see that the movie is singling out this area. What it is saying is that these hellish circumstances are reality for some, that there exists darkness and filth in the world, and it is easy to forget, or ignore, living in a first-world apartment complex. It also shows how thin the line between 'first-world' and 'ghetto' can be.It's a tragic story of a girl, an individual, but into her story there is loaded a lot of social commentary. It is difficult to discuss the movie without delving into its agenda, its subject, its political themes. It's a movie about human trafficking, a touchy subject and a touching one, but where Liam Neeson's 'Taken' uses that backdrop to show us a fast-paced action thriller, Lukas Moodysson's 'Lilja 4-Ever' knows how difficult saving people truly is and how deep-rooted the issues here are.",

I hope so, as that is how I feel. It was just not that good a film, in my opinion. When I was younger, arguably I needed bracing films like this, to help come to grasp with the potential for squalor in this world. Being (much) older now, I'm not certain what a film like this offers in terms of insight or potential solutions? And now, taking flight off an overpass does not seem the best that we can do for the Lilya's in the world. Also, I'm sorry but acting in here despite the harsh story, did not strike me as extraordinary. If in fact, the actress was underage when filming this, then the film feels oddly more exploitive than explosive to me. And adding wings, really? Also in terms of acting, the view of the parade of johns, was just an odd choice. And one can imagine an even more odd casting call... \"We want you to look pathetic, powerless and abusive...\" I'd almost rather see a film on hopelessness of the actor who's features say \"I am the perfect patron of a prostitute...\" This film just stacks the hopelessness up, and all the Rammstein in the world does not help, just makes the film seem more infantile in its tastes. And that is part of the problem.Again, I'm not fan of subjugation or slavery anywhere, but I'm also no fan of misery porn, which is how this felt. And \"Fucking Amal\" I thought avoided so much of that...

            "review_title": "Moodysson's Exploration Becomes Itself Exploitation",
            "content": "The trouble with films that deal with trafficking, and especially films that intimately examine the lives of sex workers, is walking the fine line between sensitively portraying an individual's life, and inadvertently perpetuating her sexual exploitation. The act of dwelling on the sexual violence that permeates many sex workers' lives can fuel a kind of sensationalism similar to a Barbara Walters special. Dwelling on graphical images of sex work doesn't aid sex workers; neither does it improve an audience's understanding of the complexity of sex work or how girls and women are roped into sexual slavery. At worst, dwelling on the lurid details of a sex worker's tragedy can end up catering to the public's fascination for violence and, for some, sadistic sexual pleasure in watching a 16-year-old girl being brutalized.Moodysson's film, I feel, falls into the latter category. The repeated scenes with desensitized, animalistic johns copulating, and at at times, raping, the protagonist reached the height of its efficacy sometime after the 5th one. The rest looked to be no more than gratuitous violence and indulgence in sadistic pornography (minus X-rate details) that conveyed little information to the audience. All I could conclude was that they were filmed for the enjoyment of lecherous old men or sadists who enjoy watching a young woman being tortured. Even the couple sitting in front of me found them pointlessly offensive and left.The fact is that the public loves sensationalism, and it loves hearing of stories of 6-year-old girls being abducted and god-knows-what unspeakable thing done to them (remember Jean Benet in the tabloids?). The ABC \"documentary\" on sex trafficking several years ago easily confirmed this when it bypassed exploring the layered complexity of sex trafficking and, instead, dwelled on lurid details given by former prostitutes with equally lurid reinactments for viewers to gawk at. I had expected more from Mr. Moodysson's film. It would have been refreshing to see a film with an unapologetically determined Lilja quickly wising up to the realities of the world, and taking a far more proactive stance in dealing with the abuse. Sex workers are too often shown as passive, impotent participants in the sex trade with little decision-making power. The reality is that many sex workers choose to remain in the sex industry in spite of opportunities to leave. Stories of enslavement, like Lilja's, are just one small portion of a much larger picture. It is important to recognize that many sex workers are far more in control of their own destiny than Lilja.",

Lukas Moodysson is very honest to expose the sheer tragedy of how poverty pushes a young life to the River Styx. Fortunately, the appearance of the guardian angel Volodya somehow mercifully simmers the glaciated senses.I guess I have lived in comfort for too long, and so unconsciously silly, I picked this movie on the second day of the Chinese New Year and also the second day of my birthday. Tears were oozing out from my heart why I saw Lilja being devastated in Sweden. A holiday of pain I had.Watching the film, I suddenly remember a tragedy. In 1994, a New Zealander lawyer, Gary Alderdice, who was a well-known socialite and Queen's Counsel in the former British Hong Kong, was found brutally killed in Vladivostok, Russia with a 20-year-old Russian prostitute, Natalya Samofalova whom he got to know in the former Portuguese enclave Macau.

I read somewhere that this film is 'torture porn', nonsense, despite the sleazy, damning impression it leaves on you, it's a very tastefully made film. It's unremittingly depressing, but always tasteful.It's somewhat one-track in its storytelling; almost everyone is callous, abusive and indifferent about Lilya's well-being, none more so than her mother, who deserts her, initiating Lilya's dive into veritable squalor. I can understand how these people are going to be embittered by their tough, filthy neighbourhood, but some of the characters' cruelty and selfishness border on evil. Her only friend is Volodya (Artyom Bogucharsky), a young admirer of hers who is always thinking in her best interest. The young pair give terrifically natural performances, which help achieve the film's aura of hyperrealism.Much like films such as 'Import/Export', the camera captures the striking, achromatic landscapes of Eastern European housing projects. The scale of its anaemic bleakness that is visually arresting.The total deprivation in this film makes one appreciative of not only family and friends but basic commodities too. Lilya is thrown into a world of abject poverty, where the living conditions are so desperate that we see her attempting to sell her few, worthless possessions on a street corner. Lilya and Volodya frequently talk about a better life, but they're both so tragically far away from their fantasies. Inevitably, she discovers that prostitution is the most lucrative way of assuring she has the resources to be able to live and maybe even achieve her dreams.Throughout the film, I wanted to reach into the screen and cradle the sweet little Oksana Akinshina, attacking anyone who wanted to exploit her for whatever disgusting purpose. The film puts an innocent, sympathetic face on prostitution, an industry that's unfairly maligned and condemned by society. In fact, the film puts an innocent, sympathetic face on the underclass; its candid hyperrealism gives you a vivid portrait of total and utter destitution, helping you understand and empathise with their lamentable lives.",

I got very invested in the title character and I'd definitely call it one of the most disturbing movies I'd ever seen (which from me is ordinarily a big compliment). The movie creates a desolate little world where people believably have only the resources to take care of themselves. It's stylish, well paced and not without a sense of humour to pepper its sordidness in a way that is very well judged.But although its style isn't aggressive, its content is. It just gets draining, rather than moving to see so much misfortune come to one person. I'm not saying I don't believe it, it's just not exactly subtle. The attempt to raise its own spirits though some sudden third act fantasy (not fantasy as in make believe but legit magic stuff) is daring but but the price of audacity is the chance of falling flat.It's definitely an experience. I don't want to hate on it. But even people like me who see movies as a masochistic experience found this the wrong measures of brutality and sentimentality.",

            "content": "If you're in the mood for a happy Hollywood ending, don't watch Lilja 4-Ever. Unlike Taken, Trade, or The Whistleblower, to name a few, this film is bleak, unadulterated, raw, and incredible. This film sews your eyes open so that you cannot close them to the reality of poverty, suicide, and the sex trade. Lilja 4-Ever, forces you to come face-to-face with real issues, and there is not a single minute of this movie that sugarcoats these issues.Lilja 4-Ever is not only one of the best films on prostitution that I've seen, but it is one of the best foreign films I've seen. It is loosely based on the true story of Dangoule Rasalaite, a sixteen- year-old girl who committed suicide in Malm\u00f6, Sweden, after being sold into sex slavery. Lukas Moodysson, director and writer, read Rasalaite's story in the paper one morning, giving him the idea to create a film.Actress Oksana Akinshina, as Lilja, is absolutely spectacular. Her performance is flawless: her portrayal of sixteen-year-old Lilja is both heart-wrenching and awe- inspiring. I found that as I watched this film, I became more and more attached to Akinshina's character solely because she was relatable. Moodysson's writing was beyond effective to break hearts with the realization that every human life is valuable and deserving of love and empathy. Lilja 4-Ever could have been filtered through artistic angles and shots, and it could have undergone hours and hours of editing, but it didn't. This is the brilliance of Lukas Moodysson. Yet again, he presents us with something real.The authenticity of this film was what set it apart, what made it special. Another aspect in which it was more realistic than others was in the story line. It presented to us a typical girl and a typical life. Lilja and her mother live alone in a small inner-city, low- income apartment in Estonia. . Lilja's mother meets a guy online and abandons Lilja to move to his home in the U.S. Soon, Lilja meets the love of her life. Andrej gives her a ride home from the club (she goes out to sell herself) and tells her he doesn't want to sleep with her. He takes her on a date and buys her everything she wants. A couple weeks later, Andrej tells Lilja that he is moving to Sweden and that he can find her a job picking vegetables. He gives her a fake passport but soon tells her that he cannot join her. Lilja travels alone to Sweden and is met by Andrej's boss, who puts her in a car and locks her into an apartment, which Lilja finds strange. The next evening, she services her first trick. This is the reality of the sex trade and how most victims are lured into it. The word \"pimp\" is never used, and \"prostitute\" isn't mentioned. Lilja, like millions of others, slowly falls into this life. It is not by choice; it is by necessity, na\u00efvet\u00e9, and empty promises. This long, slow and painful journey into the sex trade is reality, and Lilja 4-Ever doesn't shy away from telling us. It happens to our children, siblings, and friends, right under our noses. It devours us and leaves us empty, and in some cases, it kills us. The bleakness of the sex trade is real, and it would be foolish to turn a blind eye to it.Do I recommend this film? Most definitely.",

            "content": "Our world is sick. After returning from 10 years in Brazil where I experienced the consequences of child poverty first hand, I realised that many of my friends in Europe & America are unaware of the barren hell hole that 80% of our planet really is. Much like City of God and Maria Full of Grace, this brutally honest film exposes the truth behind the veneer of tourist brochures, while leaving moral judgements to the viewer. Moodysson does not point fingers, neither does he attempt to suggest a cure for the rotten state of the human race at the start of the 21st century. The geopolitical discussion of whether global capitalism will eventually save or further exploit all the forgotten Liljas and Volodjas out there belongs somewhere else. Instead, Moodysson takes us through the dry facts of Lilja's short existence from her own perspective, without spearing us any of the gruesome details. In real life sometimes there is no happy ending, and not even as much a sad melodramatic ending. In real life sometimes there are no heroes or martyrs. Sometimes real life is simply arbitrary and brutal. We become aware that not all is well around us.Even Swedish society, supposedly a textbook example of freedom and social inclusiveness, benefits from the exploitation of the dehumanised millions outside of Fortress Europe. Just like the \"normal\", respectable men who paid for Lilja's \"services\", we are so content in our carefree sauna&sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord world that we have become blind to this fact.Lilja is flawed character - a rather average, selfish and insecure teenager. She is not particularly bright, pretty, talented or strong. She probably had the opportunity to save herself despite her harsh plight, but she made stupid decisions. She is the kind of child you can imagine living in one of those run down apartment blocks, being bullied by her peers and engraving phrases into chairs in bad English. That makes her all the more likable, as she reminds us of our own children who are, by and large, average and insecure teenagers who listen to music with friends, take drugs and do stupid things. The only difference being, since they were born in the West, their naiveness does not land them in hell - quite literally! When Lilja winds up as a living dead in Sweden she is provided with all the riches she has always dreamt of: a warm, luxurious flat and all the McDonald's and Coca Cola she could possibly want, enough to make her (and me) puke even. \"There you go, b***h, what are you complaining about?\", the facial expression of her pimp seemed to say. In some sick way, I almost felt vindicated as viewer. The Rammstein song in the finale seemed to scream at me the ironic line \"You should have respected the virgin Mary while you still had the chance, you stupid, stupid girl! You should have accepted your situation instead of lusting after a better life in America. Now you'll burn for your sins!\"Volodja's character is beautiful - an abused and neglected boy who is nonetheless brave and joins forces with the only other loser on the apartment block, believing that this marriage of convenience will make the two of them invincible. But despite being stronger and wiser than the much older Lilja, even he is no hero. He reminds us that for every Billy Elliot out there who \"makes it\" there are one thousand Volodjas who go to the dogs.Apart from a few technicalities and the cheesy angel scene this film is nearly flawless as a work of art alone. Even if there was no message or story behind Lilja-4-ever, I would still give it 8/10 because it captures a mood in a way rarely seen in cinema, a mood I would summarise as \"barren\". The sound track is genius. There couldn't have been a more appropriate song than Tatu's \"You're not Gonna Get Us\" to accompany Liljas last days of happiness.",

If you want to study the world you should study the most vulnerable parts of the world.\"- Lukas MoodyssonAccording to director Lukas Moodysson (Show Me Love, Together), heaven is where you jump around with wings on your back and play basketball all day. On earth, however, it's another story. Ask Lilya (Oksana Akanshina), the main protagonist in Moodysson's powerful but despairing new Russian-language feature, Lilya 4-Ever. The Lars Von Trier and Dogme 95 influence is quite apparent in the exaggerated use of the hand-held camera and the film's portrayal of women as victims of abusive men.16-year old Lilya (Oksana Akinshina) lives in a small, unnamed city in the Soviet Union. When her mother abandons her and moves to the United States, an aunt puts her up in a run-down flat then refuses to have anything more to do with her. Her only friend is young Volodya (Artyom Bogucharsky) who lives on the streets and attaches himself to Lilya. They hang around together and fantasize about a better life. Her only hope for survival lies in selling her body. Surprisingly, Lilya falls in love with a young good-looking guy named Andrei who appears to be honest and caring. When she follows him to Sweden to start a new life, however, the ugly realities become all too apparent.The performances by the young actors are outstanding and Mr. Moodysson again displays his talent for depicting teenagers in a very real and natural way. The film is shown from Lilya's point of view and Oksana's ability to portray a wide range of emotions allows the audience to identify with her plight and ride the waves along with her.Lilya 4-Ever effectively illuminates the worldwide problem of child prostitution and is not afraid to tackle hard issues without any attempt at sugarcoating. I feel, however, that it would have been more effective if Moodysson didn't insist on being so relentlessly hopeless and sensational. The film does not explore the humanity of the characters but uses them only as props to drive home a particular point of view. The characters either are disgusting old men, ruthless exploiters, unfeeling and selfish parents or relatives, or innocent victims. Mr. Moodysson has brought a very real problem to light but does not show us any way out. Indeed, he seems to be saying that since adults are abusive and God won't listen to our prayers, the only hope left is to sign up to play basketball with our wings on. In spite of a sincere effort, I found Lilya 4-Ever to be predictable and the ending pretentious and sophomoric.",

I didn't know anything about the movie until my corridor mate Daniel,a movie maniac, started telling me about a Swedish movie he watched in Sweden when he first came here. I was curious about the movie after he told me that how tragic story the movie had. What a coincidence ! The Swedish Second TV Station broadcast the movie the same night.I collapsed before the TV while I was watching the movie and was captured by the strength but ironically the familiarity of the movie subject: little children dragged into prostitution because of mafia which can do the most evil things for the sake of money. I hated myself being a human being and witnessing such a tragedy story. Such stories make wide media coverage in every country. Particularly the dismantling of Socialism created economic and social degeneration in the countries which were once ruled by iron fist.The little girl is an Russian origin Estonian.Not an ethnic Estonian but a Russian origin Estonian. Presumably, the director aimed to draw attention to discrimination and economic poverty tarnishing the lives of Russian minority in the country.The movie seems to have been made with a pretty modest budget if one realizes that the locations are quite limited in number and there is no one whose face could be familiar to a movie fan. However, the little girl in her acting ability has been unforgettable in my point of view. While I was watching the movie, I sometimes asked myself if the actress herself was really the little girl abandoned by her mother and hit by economic degradation in her country.Showing those older men who had done all the evil acts to take advantage of the girl are shown with very influential scenes.I am sometimes wondering how a mature man can get pleasure by having sexual intercourse with a girl at a very young age. My blood is frozen.I stopped myself hard to turn off the TV while watching the movie.I don't know why but wish the little girl had not died..Instead, she would go to police and the Swedish Government would provide her with protection and housing.About the musics of the movie,I am not really impressed. More tragic sounds could be integrated to the movie. When compared to high level of performance the main character has exhibited in the movie, the musical background is not proper in my point of view.This movie..I believe that every parent should watch this movie again and again to understand very pure and beautiful dreams that each young has. Life in a stable environment provided by devoting parents.Girls like Lilja are everywhere. Probably most of us see such girls in the every corner of the cities and on highways.

However, the plot is slightly more interesting than that, although, as I stated earlier, there really is no hope and things will inevitably get from bad to worst. I must admit that I will never learn to appreciate Moodysson's cinematography.  It annoys me as no other Scandinavian Dogma-95-influenced cinematography does.  I actually believe that he tries oh-so-hard to prove to someone (God?Scandinavian audience?Lars von Trier) that this is the group he associates himself with. The acting by the first-time child actors is good, as it is in most Moodysson's films.  And yet, the benefit of being able to understand Russian clearly demonstrated that a)those Russian kids are directed by a foreigner (duh), and b)their parts were not written by someone who is very fluent in Russian.  Their performances were not wooden-but their delivery kind of was. However, most of the actors in this film were a pleasure to watch. Overall, 7/10, just for the skillful and honest (albeit, annoying at times) presentation of the tragedy.",

            "content": "Just got back home after seeing a preview of Lukas Moodysson's highly anticipated movie, \"Lilja 4-ever\". Having seen the brilliant trailer and reading interviews with Moodysson, I expected to see a movie that was disturbing and gripped the viewers emotions. The first part of my expectations was correct, the second wasn't. Perhaps watching movies makes you numb, since many people in the audience were crying, but the experience wasn't as intense as I hoped it would be. Don't get me wrong here, the things that Lilja (brilliantly played by Oksana Akinshina) had to live through were horrible. But I never got the feeling that I was in the movie. My position was always only an observer - sort of like watching a documentary. Moodysson's style of writing and directing is suitable for stories such as the ones in his previous work (heavily dialogue-packed), but when it comes to put a character's emotions on screen, Moodysson's limitations are painfully obvious. In \"Requiem for a Dream\" (2000), director Darren Aronofsky succeeded to throw you right inte the hell that the characters experience by not only relying in great actors, but enhancing them with cinematography, editing, sound and music (believe me, I was shaking when I got out from that movie and wasn't sure that I wanted to experience that again, although I loved it). Moodysson only uses the actors and the great soundtrack and never visualizes the script he's written. The second problem of the movie, is that it never kicks off. It appears to be standing still on the same place where it begins. Every time that you feel that the story might evolve, it gets back to its original state. Sure, life works this way, but it only made \"Lilja 4-ever\" seem repetetive and long. I know that my comment may seem negative, but this is only a display of my unsatisfaction. Akinshina is, as told, fantastic and the story is very unsettling and makes you think of what really goes on in this crazy world we live in. Things right in front of us, that you don't see (or don't want to see). Wort seeing and thinking of, but do yourselves a favour and lower your expectations; that way will be more rewarding for you.

But then again one must understand why this movie was made in the first place. Mr. Mood-97 comes from a cultural elite in Sweden where he's basically been served anything on a silver platter, from budget, from support in magazines and TV, from politicians and nepotistic relations. No one dares to give him bad criticism without fear of being labeled as a pimp and a lover of prostitution.He doesn't care about no prostitutes or human trafficking; he only cares to shock because he wants people to feel bad and awful without no other given background or motivation, except this one; I feel sorry for all those lured into his web of intrigue; the more you like his movies the wider his smile gets taking a stroll down to the local bank.The only prostitute in this project is probably him for making money and fame on such a controversial topic.SPOILERS: A Russian deserted girl gets lured into being a hostage in a one room apartment in Sweden where her polish pimp sells her as a prostitute to different Johns. This rather minimalistic story could've been made in so many different and interesting ways; but instead of showing social mechanisms, political turmoil, economic strife we get to see endless sex being displayed one tasteless session after another. WE ALL KNOW: what an under aged prostitute is forced to do against her will. But why? This movie says very little about this.Why do I seem so critical: Every work mr. Mood-97 has done is about exploitation and sensationalism. He takes the temp on the society and decides to make a movie that'll fit the mood of the critics and which project will render him the most fame and money - there may be nothing wrong with that as long as you're honest.To me director (\"Alexander\"-Lukas) of this awfully made movie is nothing more than an egoistic, megolomanical, narcissistic hack.Shame to all those who put up money for this project.This is a movie that seems worse and more transparent each time one thinks about it.",

            "content": "When her mother's boyfriend plans to go to America, things are looking up for Lilja, who dreams of a new life in the west. However when her mother decides that Lilja should stay in Estonia for a while before joining them, things look bleak. Her aunt immediately moves her out of her comfortable flat, into a run down flat in a bad block in order to save money. When her friend gets her the reputation of being a whore she finds herself alone with only young Volodya for company. With money getting tight and her mother nowhere to be seen, Lilja picks up a few guys at a bar where prostitutes work. Despite this she meets a nice guy who doesn't just want her for sex and again things begin to look up for her as she gets another chance to escape her surroundings.When this film came onto television, the announcer said something along the lines of 'and now, in a break from his more feel good work, director Lukas Moodysson\u0085.'. Now maybe I have it wrong but Moodysson has never put the words 'feel good' into my head and I assumed that this film would be pretty bleak as a result. I was correct in my assumptions and this film could almost been seen as a study of one bleak life. Opening with a thumpingly aggressive few minutes, we step back a few months to find Lilja's life starting to fall apart. For the first half of the film this is believable and convincing but then it starts to take it to extremes and, while still interesting and engaging, is not as convincing and loses much of its dramatic power. The second half just becomes one piece of abuse after another and it becomes more than the story, we get the idea very quickly and after that it appears not to have a great deal to say passed this.It is a shame because hers is a tragic story that (I understand) is not too dissimilar to the fate of too many (all be it a minority of course) girls from the former Russian states. However here the telling doesn't have a good enough script to really carry it and the falling back on shocking scenes of rape and suffering is not a replacement for a genuinely tragic human story. Part of the problem is that we never get to know Lilja that well, from the very start on we see her suffering in one way or another and this appears to be the focus; aside from the odd scene here and there she is never really allowed to be a real person. Akinshina tries hard and she convinced me with her grim, dead stare and desperation but other than that I didn't get much from her. The support cast is OK but again only Bogucharsky's character comes off as being semi-real, the rest are merely the tools of Lilja's destruction. The direction is pretty good \u0096 mobile but not jerky, close but not obtrusive.Overall this is a pretty bleak little film that makes for an engaging story but not one that manages to keep up its dramatic motion during the second half. The story becomes less about our character and more about her suffering, the acts of sexual violence become the focus rather than their results. Still interesting though and memorable for being so bleak and tragic but could have been better told.",

            "content": "In \"Lilja 4-Ever,\" Lukas Moodysson presents a grim new reality: human trafficking in young women in Eastern Europe. Depending on their luck, these hapless females can be turned into slaves, or prostitutes, or wives. In Ira Sach's recent \"Forty Shades of Blue\" a Memphis music producer (Rip Torn) has a beautiful young Russian wife (Dina Korzun) -- we never learn how he got her. Moodysson focuses on pretty blonde Russian sixteen-year-old Lilja (Oksana Akinshina), whose parents horribly and inexplicably choose to go to America leaving her behind. She is quickly swept up and shipped to Sweden to be a prostitute, cheerful and completely innocent of what is going to happen to her.We begin in a bleak contemporary Russia where people talk in telegraphic sentences and the only hint of value and belief is a religious reproduction Lilja keeps on the wall and says the Lord's Prayer to. Her only friend is a childish fourteen-year-old boy, Volodya (Artyom Bogucharsky), himself an outcast, who's plain and sweet and cares only for her. In leaving the country she abandons him as her mother had abandoned her. In both cases the child left behind pretends indifference and then is devastated. Volodya commits suicide with two bottles of pills he had found in the destitute apartment Lilya was forced into by her aunt when her mother left.The point is clearly made: nobody cares about these kids.Hoberman wrote that this pushed out Gaspar No\u00eb's \"Irr\u00e9versible\" for the most downbeat movie of the year. But these are two very different kinds of work. Moodysson isn't playing events for their shock value as No\u00eb plays his -- not quite, anyway. There are two elements that balance out the relentless sadness of Lilja's little tale. In addition to being very pretty, she has a lightness about her. And when Volodya reappears as an angel with wings in sequences that comfort the girl, the director introduces an air of grace and purity -- a dream of the real childhood these kids never had -- that offsets some of the nastiness. Otherwise there would be a danger that the film-making might seem as brutal as the actions of the human traffickers. In fact, that danger lingers anyway.Someone has said that Lilja shouldn't be so pretty, that it's hard to believe her mother would leave behind such a good-looking girl. This is odd logic, and in fact the girl's beauty is what makes her ultimate fate believable, if not inevitable. Those who have a lovely exterior are doomed to a certain amount of objectification under the best of circumstances. Here, Lilja never gets a chance to show what's inside.Moodysson's style is linked with the minimalist, defiant Dogme school of film-making. It's a long long way from the humanistic visions of post-WWII Italian \"neorealismo,\" which also dealt with the downtrodden and the hopeless, but in films that sang and made one weep. As one saw in his cheerful Seventies commune comedy \"Together,\" Moodysson is great with children, and Akinshina and Bogucharsky are wonderful in this film. He might have found more beauty and richer human detail in Lilja's story. For me it went by too quickly, and it almost left one wondering if it really matters. That can't be what the director has in mind. But others say that \"Lilja 4-ever\" can sing and make them weep, too. If that's possible, it must be the angel-Volodya who makes it so. Though I'm not sure how I feel about it, I'm clear that \"Lilja 4-ever\" is an important film.",

            "content": "Lilja 4-Ever 5/20/2010Swedish director Lukas Moodysson's \"Lilja 4 Ever\" is a bleak, heartbreakingly honest story about the lives of young people in the former Soviet Union. His debut film \"Show me Love\" was reviewed earlier on this blog. In his writing and directing he has shown a great ability to bring out honest emotions and humanity to his characters.Lilja is a 16 year old girl who lives with her mother in a cold concrete housing complex in Estonia. She starts out as a beautiful, morally strong girl who just happens to be in a terrible situation. Through an agency her mother has found a Russian man who lives in America to marry her. Lilja is thrilled and thinks she is going too, but hold on she is to be sent for later. After her mother's departure, Lilja is moved into an even smaller, even dirtier complex by her cold and angry Aunt. Lilja's only friend at school betrays her and is left completely alone. She meets Volodya, a 12 year old boy living in the same complex who complains that his father is \"crazy\". After being kicked out Lilja allows him to stay in her apartment as long as there is no \"funny stuff\". These characters have had to grow up fast and have little hope of making anything for themselves but still find the courage to move on. With no money to buy food and her Aunt refusing and unable to help; Lilya is forced to sell herself at a disco to pay the bills. On her way home one night she meets Andrei, a good looking, well to do man, who is quite out of place in this environment. He tells her that he doesn't want sex but to be her friend. After a few dates he talks her into to moving to Sweden where he could get her a good paying job. This is all too good to be true and everyone but Lilja can see it. She is so blinded by her hopes and dreams that she is willing to do anything. Deep down does she really believe him? What will happen to Volodya? This is what makes the last part of the film that much more heartbreaking. Lilja arrives in Sweden without Andrei, who says \"he'll be there in a few days\". She is picked up at the airport by another man who takes her passport and brings her to a decent looking apartment, but the door locks from the outside. Just as we suspected Lilja has been sold into prostitution, and let's just say Volodya doesn't fair to well by himself. The film does end on a peaceful note, but at what cost?",

            "content": "I was reluctant to see this film because I thought it would just leave me depressed and angry. I thought that since I was already aware of the sexual exploitation of children, I wouldn't gain anything from it. I was persuaded to see it by remarks I read by people who work with trafficked women and declared it very realistic. I also found it interesting that after its opening in Stockholm, the women reviewers raved about it and the men reviewers disparaged it.Having seen the film, I think it was incredibly well done. What I liked most was its portrayal of the ways Lilja fights back while being enslaved and its depiction of how the experience of being forced to grow up fast slowly smothers her childlike spirit. People who are offended by the film's negative portrayal of men aren't taking into account that Moodysson shows Lilya being treated badly by women characters as well.I like that Moodysson chose to set the film in Europe. It's easy for Westerners to criticize the abuse of women in countries we treat as inferior; what we often fail to see is what we allow to happen in our own countries. Moodysson answers the question, \"How could this happen?\"Unlike many films about prostitutes, Lilja 4-ever doesn't sexually objectify Lilya. Rather, it conveys that Lilja sells her body in order to avoid starving, and that she is tricked into going to Stockholm. It shows how the world turns her from determined and proactive to passive and impotent. Moodysson attempts to portray the story from Lilja's point of view and, in my opinion, succeeds. ECPAT International (www.ecpat.net) is one organization fighting the sexual exploitation of children.The Spanish-subtitle version is called \"Alas de la Vida.\" Read Jane Liu's comment -- it gives you a different take and is worth your time.",

            "content": "\"Lilja 4-Ever\" has been eagerly anticipated in Moodysson's native Sweden after the critical acclaim that his previous two films have received. I cannot imagine that I am the only person who came out of it disappointed. On one hand we can be thankful that he has shunned the usual \"feel-good\" style of Swedish cinema (family is happy, something bad happens, everyone is down but ultimately turn things around) and presented something a lot darker, but on the other hand in doing this he has lost the essential elements of a good film.The film lacks narrative and fails to evoke any emotions from the viewer beyond disgust. In an unexpected display of lazy film-making he resorts to extended scenes designed purely to nauseate the audience. There is no attempt to explore why things happen, he merely presents Lilja's situation again and again and again. The storyline, what little there is, feels unnecessarily contrived as Lilja falls from bad situation to bad situation to bad situation.Ultimately the film feels as if it has been designed purely to start debate (or maybe just moral outrage) in the tabloid newspapers that always feel a need to be outraged about something. For me the film was just lazy. It takes no effort at all to make a film about prostitution that disgusts the viewer - a decent director can do that in his sleep - yet that is all Moodysson has managed to do.",

            "content": "When I rented this film I was expecting some kind of road movie at the end of which Lilya would have learnt some lessons to apply in her life. As some people would say: Boy, was I mistaken! \"Lilya 4ever\" deals with the life in a former soviet republic (Estonia I think). After the fall of socialism the living standards in the former soviet republics declined to a very low level. Many people (at least in 2002) live precariously under a roof without good heating to protect them from the winter cold, and have barely enough to eat. Alcoholism and sadness are dominant. In this bleak picture Lilya dreams about a better life somewhere else. Dreams about going to USA (that blows off like a balloon), and then Sweden, where she and a friend will go to trying to fulfill their dreams. But Sweden will be a bitter surprise. I don't want to give away much of the plot but I will say this: Lilya is a pretty, sensitive and hard-headed sixteen-year old girl. For girls like her if they want to achieve something, there are not many choices. The easiest choice is prostitution. It is the road that gives means to overcome hunger and cold. As Lilya's life becomes worse and worse in Estonia, this road seems to call louder and louder with its bright lights. In spite of her inner repulsion Lilya becomes a prostitute and goes to discotheques in order to get clients. One night in a disco she meets a young guy that becomes her friend. They go out together and one day he (he works in Sweden, he says) offers her a job in Sweden. And Sweden, as I've already said, will be a very bitter surprise. What she finds there will be far worse than anything she's ever imagined. I guess you know what I'm meaning. I can say that \"Lilya 4ever\" impressed me deeply. Days after I had seen the film, many of its images still lingered in my memory. And I've heard about Brazilian girls (my country) that have been offered similar invitations and suffered similar fates. This film is dark and tender at the same time. And for those that are completely bereft of hope there's still the dream to emigrate to another life after death. This hope is called Heaven where angels play basketball all the time like Mike Jordan, and everyone can do whatever he/she likes. Oksana Akinshina gives a stellar interpretation as Lilya. She really moved me. This film will give you an emotional knowledge of the issue treated by the film",

In Moodysson's previous films there has always been some kind of happiness and joy, at least in the end, but in this one we follow Lilja (the brilliant Oksana Akinshina) closer and closer to Hell.\nLilja's mother has left her and she is left on her own after her aunt kicks her out of the house. Everyone betrays Lilja even her best friend, who teaches her how to sell her body, which Lilja refuses. Everyone except the boy Volodja (lovely Artiom Bogucharskij) with whom she can share her dreams and goals.The neighbourhood boys throw things on Lilja and calls her a whore, but Lilja still sits on the bench and carves \"Lilja 4-ever\" to prove that she is alive. But Lilja has to fight to stay alive. She needs money. And the only way of getting some is the sell the only thing she has left.Lilja's and Volodja's only hope is a life after this it seems. But is suicide the right answer? Should you continue to fight life? Lilja prays to God every night, wishing for a better life, but gets no answer.\n\"Lilja 4-ever\" may seem a bit over the top at times but still it feels very realistic.  You keep telling yourself it's only a film. This isn't real, but it IS real. Moodysson clearly wants us to react, to do something and he has certainly succeeded in that. I promise, if there was an aid bus going to Russia to help young children outside the cinema at least half of the visitors would jump on it.",

It's a strong movie, by far Lucas Moodysson's best, but you walk out as the same person you were before. It hasn't the power of \"Requiem for a Dream\" or \"Breaking the Waves\" for example. This is about a Russian society which might be compared to Dickens' London or maybe worse. Everyone is in a way evil, except for the little boy Volodja. Lilja's customers are pigs from hell, nearly all of them. In some way prostitutes customers of course ARE from hell, but in some way they might be humans too. There is one lonely customer who asks Lilja to hold his hand before the act. He's not from heaven, but he is a person.The \"bad\" thing about this film is that you really can't believe these people exist. This is an apocalypse, not the world, not even Sweden or Russia. That means one doesn't get that involved that Moodysson would like us to be. It's a very strong movie although, but not perfect and not realistic in a deeper sense.",

The film exposes the surreal truths of life and is very sad and disturbing. Right the moment the film begins, the story delves into the ruthless situations our 16 year old protagonist is exposed to. The film shows the anguishes of a sixteen year old girl full of zeal, who is cheated through fate and is a victim of the cruelty of the real world. The character and the situations created in the film look so real that you are filled with a feeling of disgust and agony; which is the real power of this film. The film has many unlovable and disturbing moments and will linger in your mind for days to come. So if you're anticipating a film to uplift your moods, this is not the one you ought to go for. But concerning a good film exposing the real picture of a society, this one you should definitely watch.Rating: 2 stars out of 4",

I forgot it was just a movie while I watched it, it was like being dropped into her crumbling world and watching events unfold helplessly.

Especially towards the end of the movie, when the wings appear. It was similar to Dancer in the Dark and Dogville, two other movies I didn't care for, in terms of creating simplistic heroines who we are invited to watch suffer for two hours (more or less). It's a very simple strategy and I find Moodysson a bit exploitative of the very women he says he's trying to help.

Her aunt is supposed to look for her, but she refuses her to stay in the old apartment (which the aunt usurps for herself), she also refuses to give her food or money. Lelya is brought to a dirty old flat whose former tenant has just died recently. Lelya's only friend is 13 years old Volodya who has to live on the street because his drunk father misuses him. When Lelya asks her aunt from what she should live, she gets the answer she should spread out her legs like her mother did. Together with an also 16 years old colleague, the girl starts to visit pick-up bars, where she is very successful. Full of proud she enters the food store and can afford for the first time more than potato chips and cigarettes. The pain of being a whore she tries to escape by inhaling glue which Volodya finds in a deserted military plant.After a few weeks, when Lelya does not get the promised letters and the money from her mother who emigrated to America, she goes to the social help office where she is told that her mother has refused parenthood because Lelya has always been an unwanted child. On her way home from a customer, she meets Andrey who plays the good-guy, and Lelya falls into his trap. Andrey tells her that he loves her and promises her a life together, a job and a big apartment in Sweden. However, on the day when they are supposed to fly together, he sends her alone to the flight with a false passport according to which she is already 20 years old. Lelya does not smell the catastrophe that is coming upon her. In Malm\u00f6 she is picked up by Andrey's alleged boss, a pimp who sells Lelya to his customers and keeps her imprisoned in an anonymous building where her cries for help are not heard. After she is raped several times, Lelya uses the first possibility to escape and jumps from an interstate bridge.This wonderful movie shows Death who is approaching Lelya already early. Volodya, Lelya's only friend, killed himself with an overdose of pills after Lelya left and he did not succeed to warn her by telling her that her job-offer as a vegetable-picker could hardly be true in wintertime. Often she is praying before a picture of the Guardian Angel, and in the night she sees Volodya visiting her with white wings. Actually, she never knew that he ended his life. However, to Lelya, too, Death comes as a friend. This is one of the only movies I have ever seen where there is a thoroughly positive relation to suicide. In Lelya's situation there is no other way out than escape by Death. Death shows as the big hope if you have no chance anymore, if you cannot carry your burden anymore. And if you are desperate enough, there is no need for tablets, a weapon or a cord. Death is just around you.",

This is based on Danguole Rasalaite, a 16-year-old girl from Lithuania who had come to Sweden in 2000 and was kept by a pimp who forced her to repay him for travel expenses by prostituting herself. She escaped only to later by assaulted by her boyfriend and two others, leading to her jumping off a bridge and dying. Three letters that she had told the story, which became a major story in the country. In fact, this film has been used in Eastern European countries. To warn young women about human trafficking.Lilya Michailova (Oksana Akinshina) believes that she is leaving with her mother for America, but instead she's abandoned to be with her aunt, who takes her nice apartment and leaves her behind. Her school life is not much better, as a rumor begins that she's a prostitute and she ends up raped before she decides to just follow the stories and start making money with her body. This journey takes her away from her only friend Volodya (Artyom Bogucharsky), an abused boy who soon ends his life, taking the form of an angel who tries to atone for his death and fix Lilya's life. Yet by the time she gets to Sweden, another man has lied to her and she's trapped by a violent pimp. By the end, the bridge is waiting to take her away from this world and to two potential happy endings, one in which she changes her path and another where she and Volodya make it to some form of the afterlife.Volodja has a lesson in this, as he says, \"I killed myself and went to Heaven and yeah, it's really good in Heaven. But I regret it, 'cause I wanted to live on Earth a little longer. You remain dead for all eternity, but you're alive only for a brief moment.\"Moodysson has really made a turn in this film, showing a dark side of life and not just alienation and anxiety.

            "content": "I first reviewed this title 10 years ago when it became my favourite film of the new millennium overnight. Very sadly, not much has changed since then. Lilja 4-ever still is a gut wrenchingly faithful portrayal of what life in the ex Soviet Union and in some other countries of the ex Communist Block is like. Living from one day to the other with no hope, no illusion, no desire for a more humane, more livable life because this is the only one that people know. Bleak, grey towns, sordid streets, dilapidated buildings, rugs for clothes, homeless kids sheltering themselves in bus stops or against heat-conducting pipelines criss-crossing the gigantic labyrinths of housing projects.Inequality in some of the countries of Eastern Europe and South-Eastern Europe is mindblowing. While streetwise, self-made 'businessmen' and their footsoldiers are cruising the streets behind the tinted windows of gas-guzzler SUVs, pursuing dubious trades, others eat from out of garbage cans or queue up for social welfare. All my respect goes to Lukas Moodysson who took the courage (and also managed) to show all this with no artistic exaggeration or soothing 'feel-good inserts' and 'elevator music'. Ten years ago, the perfect set for this type of movie was 'somewhere in the former Soviet Union'. Today, the list of possible alternate locations just goes on and on. And yes, I have met girls, boys, young adults like Lilja, and I have met living conditions like hers, and I have met ghost-towns like the one she comes from. That is why I am saying it would be a mistake to state that what Moodysson addresses here is only human trafficking and sex slavery. There are a whole lot more layers to this movie. This was/is the true portrayal of a whole set of aspects of urban life in a low-GDP country east of Austria.Lilja-4-ever is unpretentious in cinematography, editing, sound editing; almost entirely respecting the Dogma pact. I don't think the angel wing sequences are too much here. There needs to be a way to show that the only deliverance these people can count on - after innumerable betrayal of this life - is what comes in the afterlife.I have not seen a better movie in the past ten years, which crowns Lilja's heartbreaking story as the best picture - in my virtual collection of the grands - of the 21st century.",

I watch a lot of movies and I really like movies that deal with the tougher issues and does not candy coat reality. That said, this is a movie about prostitution traffic in Russia, centering on the beautiful Lilya. I must warn that this movie hits hard, not with graphic scenes but with stunning performances and film-making. Oksana Akinshina amazed me in this movie, I had seen her in a very small role before in The Bourne Supremacy at the end of the movie, but she deserves to be noticed, as an amazing young actor. The story is heartbreaking and the kind of movie that will make you want to actually do something to help a truly pathetic situation in the world today. Very powerful in every aspect, and highly recommended.",

The film dramatizes one such story.American network television ran an expose of this issue in 2000.  This film -- well-done as it is -- could easily have been a dramatization of that documentary, as every manipulations used by the slavers (including their assigned tasks in the slave chain) were fully discussed on the t.v. show, 20/20.  Victims are usually uneducated, poor, have little family and are told they will be given legitimate jobs in other countries (including the U.S.) to help support their families back home.  They are often raped on arrival to put fear in them, told the local police are co-conspirators so running away is futile.  Russia is notorious for it.  However, it occurs in most European countries.  Run by criminal syndicates (yes, for real).The fantasy dream sequences are a bit kitschy and I can only figure that it is related to the glue-sniffing that goes on in the film.\nHundreds of these women, looking for a better life, have found their way to the U.S. and some arrests and rescues have occurred in Texas and other states...From all accounts, the issue of European slavery in the U.S. barely rates a blip every few years or so in American newspapers.  One estimate is at least 20,000 European and Asian slaves work in the sex market in America.I liked the film.  However, I found the fantasy sequences detract from the main point.",

            "content": "Lilya 4-Ever sort of feels like a feature film adaptation of the hypothetical greatest student short film ever made. That probably sounds like I'm negging a movie, but hear me out - this is a far from perfect film, in that there are some really clunky elements that are hard to completely overlook... however, there are aspects to it that are exceptionally well-done. There's also a good deal more good than bad, at the end of the day.When it comes to the look of Lilya 4-Ever, it's great. It's shot in a naturalistic, almost fly-on-the-wall kind of way that would be distracting if it were pushed any further, but is applied just the right amount. As such, there's an air of credibility to much of what happens. There were times when I forgot I was watching a movie... the acting and dialogue also play a huge part in that sense of realism and immersion. The young actors here are pretty great.There's just a really goofy creative decision in the final act that's a little too much. It sort of screamed student film, and not in a good way. The bleakness of it all, while effective, also requires some suspension of disbelief. The title character is cosmically unlucky for the sake of a gruelling story, and I feel like it came close to crossing a line that would impact believability. I don't doubt the world can be cruel, but this much cruelty from so many people in such a short amount of time approaches implausible (but not to the point where I thought about it all the time - just a few scenes).I don't know, I think this movie has problems. If I talked to someone about the movie, I think I would ramble on about the flaws more than the positives. But a lot of it's really good. Despite the imperfections, the film flew by, and I was mostly emotionally invested. I just wish there'd be some changes to the way some narrative beats (especially in the second half) played out, because then this could have gone from very good to great.",

And that alone is horrible. Lilja-4ever is one of those films that haunt you for a long time after you first saw it.  It's such a desperate and hopeless film that it makes you think that there's nothing you can do to make this world a better place. And what is worse is that you trully can't do much to change the bad things that happen in our world. When I first heard the films' title I thought it was a little stupid, but after watching the film I realised what the significance of the title was.SPOILER\nWhen Lilja goes to Sweden she has to change her name to Katia, but even though she changes her name and she's being raped by numerous respectable citizens of the Swedish society night in and night out, deep inside she still is Lilja, the little girl that played basketball and sniffed glue to get high.END OF SPOILER\nI watched this film with a friend and I was already in a bad mood and when I came out of the theatre I was crying and feeling horrible not just for Lilja but for the millions of women from all over the world who have to sell their body and can't do anything about it. I felt bad as a man and I felt bad as a person. I was shocked mostly because when we hear about these stories on the news we don't pay much attention to them, but what we don't realise sometimes is that every woman, every person that suffers has it's own story to tell, a story that would make us better people if we had the chance to hear it.  And Lilja 4-ever is just that.  A story that makes us feel so bad, that in the end we become better people. 10/10",

The rest of the film is shot through with the devastating emotional pain of this moment.  You could say that, for Lilja, her life is all downhill from there but that would actually imply her life had some momentum.  Once her hardened aunt comes round and tosses her out into the street, Lilja tries valiantly to make her way but she seems to know almost as much as the audience does that her complete obliteration is inevitable.This is without a doubt one of the saddest and most painful films you will ever see.  Moodyson has always been a fierce advocate for children and young teens in his films and has always shown a remarkable sensitivity with child actors--these gifts do not fail him here.  He proves himself to be a man of many concerns, which he puts across with great subtlety.  For Lilja, sex becomes her only currency, the only option she has left, until it swallows her whole and makes her a commodity--bought and paid for, for the price of a Big Mac and fries (literally).  As Lilja is put through the meat grinder, Moodyson's allusion to \"fast food\" (it is all Lilja's captors ever feed her) becomes a powerful political metaphor against Western capitalism.  Is there nothing we can do for the Lilja's of the world?  The answer, in two words, is:  probably not.  Unlike Moodyson's other films (the excellent \"Fucking Amal (Show Me Love)\" and \"Together\"), Lilja 4-Ever is much more of a consciousness raiser than an entertainment.  It's the kind of film that will make you want to pull your loved ones close and hold on for dear life. Required viewing.",

With virtually an entire cast of debuting actors, the film is particular effective at bringing us up close and personal in Lilja's degradation from her perspective as she experiences it, especially as the very natural Oksana Akinshina keeps switching from rebellious teenager to faux woman to playful and then scared child.  Attracting men like a moth to a fantasy flame, they are all shown panting and pumping, repugnant, and selfish in their treatment of a girl.  Women are lambasted for letting their maternal feelings get overwhelmed by their bleak situations.But it is depressing when utter hopelessness becomes the only alternative, both for Lilja and her friend.The soundtrack is mostly pounding heavy metal rock in English, but evidently by European bands.",

They are supposed to leave together to America, and pitches her headlong down an interminable and hellish narrative staircase, hitting a world of pain with every bump. her mother leaves without her. Bump. she is evicted from her flat, flakes out of school, runs out of money, becomes a prostitute, gets beaten, gang raped, bump bump, and is finally sold by her scheming \"boyfriend\" into the Swedish sex trade! The descent is harrowing as it is relentless. There is a hidden nobility behind her puffed Slavic eyes and soft girlish dimples and a morality in most of her actions such as throwing away dirty money that we latch onto for dear life. She displays full hearted foolhardy optimism by trusting her slippery boyfriend against her better instincts because its the only thing that can save her from a life of ruination. That it doesn't in the end is what makes the film so disturbing.

            "content": "I finally was able to see 'Lilja 4-Ever', and I have to agree that this is a powerful, and extremely sad film about the loss of innocence. Actually, this is a familiar story, but gifted director Lukas Moodyssonknows how to tell it in a way that makes it hard to walk away unaffected. Lilja, the young Russian girl is played with great compassion by Oksana Akinshina. I imagine someone would have to be pretty cold to not feel something for this teenager, who is treated with such maliciousness, by everyone around her, with the exception of her young friend Volodya, a lonely 11 year old boy who idolizes her. And with good reason, as Lilja is pretty, incredibly sweet, and treats little Volodya with the warmth and respect that he should be getting from his own family. Of course, the only thing he gets from his cold father is hostility, and finally an order to leave the house. The two kids, each betrayed and abandoned by their families, build together, a kind of makeshift family of their own. Together they live in squalor, but they do have each other. However when Lilja is offered a chance to break free from her miserable existence, she goes for it, only to be betrayed in the worst possible way. Betrayed by anolder boy, who sends her to Sweden, and right into the hands of a white slaver/pimp. The first half of this film is grim, and pretty hard to take. But what happens to Lilja in the second half is so vile, that she, as well as the viewer has to re-think the first half, and if it really was so bad after all. And then the moment comes where Lilja realizes that her life back in Russia was actually bearable, because at least she had her freedom, and her companion, whom she realizes too late, meant a lot more to her than she knew. It seems hard to believe that anyone could watch this film and not be affected, somehow. Yes it is a movie, and it is dramatic, and the story is familiar. But there is just something about this film, about this girl who has to deal with the countless disgusting men drooling over her, and somehow remains tough throughout. She turns a couple of tricks while still in Russia, out of complete desperation. But she doesn't really cry or give way to self-pity. In fact she only really shows weakness when she is alone and no one can see her. I thought that was amazing. I know nothing of this young actress, but her performance brings something genuine, and noble to the character she plays. Playing 'Lilja' tough only made me care more about her; i was impressed by what she dealt with, without losing her mind. Because i know i couldn't deal with the things that she had to face every day. Of course in the end,it all turned out to be too much for her, and the ending is a bleak one. I was a bit doubtful before watching this film, as I read something about the Russian spoken not being realistic in style for people their age. But unless the viewer is fluent in Russian, this is not noticeable. Every line, every word is delivered with conviction and feeling. I also read a couple negative comments about the sequences with the angel wings being silly. But these scenes are merely dreams that Lilja begins to have, towards the end, when she begins to realize the hopelessness of her situation. Lilja is a girl who believes in God, and frequently looks to a painting of guardian angels, with big white wings. Her belief that in death, people become angels, might not be what many people believe. But it is her world, and this is her story. And I thought the ending was powerful, and somehow sweet. Especially after all the ugliness and sordidness that we see, it is somewhat of a revelation to end with images of such beauty, and such innocence. And when we see what Lilja's idea of 'heaven turns out to be, it is quite a surprise. And that is what affected me most about the story. I also have to mention that, even though this film deals with under-age prostitution, Moodysson has filmed this in such a way that it is not exploitative for a second. Not once does the viewer get a glimpse of Lilja's body. We only see what she sees; up-close images of sweaty, leering faces of disgusting men, as they grunt and moan in orgasm. Anyone who gets some sort of sexual kick out of looking at these images is a sick bastard. \"Lilja 4 Ever\" is not a fun film, but it is an important one. It is a film that will leave many a bit sad, and more than a bit angered at what goes on around them. This is a special film, and it is well worth the effort it will take to find it.",

Life in Russia was not easy for Lilya. Her mother and father abandoned her, her girl friend sullied her name, her aunt Anna spurned her, her school teacher ridiculed her and a handsome guy she met at a dance hall lured her away into an abominable existence of sexual slavery.Towards all these misfortunes Lilya showed a remarkable fortitude for a girl of 16. Volodja was her only support. Understandably so because his father too had disowned him.As for Aunt Anna, she has to be seen to be believed. Her first entrance comes as a bit of a shock. Her unkempt appearance made her look like a veritable battle axe, a real witch in fact. Somewhat over done, I thought.Despite the miserable lives depicted by these characters Lilya soon wins your heart as her story unfolds. Great acting and expert direction ensure that the viewer becomes deeply absorbed in the sequence of events. So terrifying for her and with little chance of escape there are poignant scenes which offer some relief when Lilya breaks into a sunny smile or when Volodja discusses their respective ages and what kind of life there might be after death.I am not sure how to interpret the closing scene of the film. I suppose it is OK if I consider it as a childish interpretation of a Heavenly existence where according to Volodja \"you can play basket ball all day\". It also echoes the opening scene where we learn that Lilya cherishes a framed picture of a guardian angel. Although she would deny it the message of that picture gave Lilya the much-needed strength to face the bleakness of her daily life.A truly absorbing film.",

From this fact alone it follows that this movie will doubtlessly has its fixed place in film history. The story is as simple as only a good story can be: Lilya grows up in the suburbs of Tallinn where the communists have left their traces amongst other in unemployment, miserable poverty and the ruins of the tenements teeming with garbage, once invented as symbol of the glorious farmers'and laborers'states. Is the early youth of Lilya characterized by hopelessness, so everything turns to the worst when her mother, a former whore, finds via newspaper announcement a boyfriend, an Estonian who had already emigrated to the U.S. The mother tells her daughter that they all will emigrate to the States, but five minutes before mother and boyfriend leave, Lilya is left behind in the \"custody\" of her primitive and brutal aunt. First, the aunt throws the 13 years old child out of the paternal apartment because she wants to leave there alone, then Lilya gets a letter from the government that her mother has refused parenthood, \"because Lilya has always been an unwanted child\". Alone and hungry she stands in her ruined and dirty apartment in which the old tenant just has died. Lilya is seriously given by her aunt the tip to \"spread your legs\" in order to get some money. Since she is beautiful, she is successful. One the way back to her barrack, she meets handsome, young a faithfully-looking Stepan. He promises her a job in Sweden. Only Lilya's friend, the 12 years old boy Volodya, doubts the integrity of Stepan. The little boy lives on the street, since his alcoholic father does not want to see him, inhales glue that he finds in a decommissioned airplane-plant, and is fully aware that he lives in a world in which he has no change and that he cannot change that and that there will be nobody to help him. This is the rough background before the ultimate catastrophe starts. The watcher of this movie may think after each disaster that happens, that now things must turn towards the good. But they don't. There will probably be not many people who can stand this movie. Even more will be unable to watch it twice (a clear proof of its quality). The movie is built in a circle, like a transit-corridor. You can so-to-say glue together beginning and end into a Moebius-strip. The film starts with \"Mein Herz Brennt\" (My heart is burning) by Rammstein, coming back like a thunderstorm in the end. The burning of the heart of the little girl finally finds a door, shown her by Volodya who has turned in her guardian angel after he swallowed a few bottles of pills. Followed by her angel Volodya, Lilya storms out of her prison, her heart burns, she is on her trip to the burning light and has just time enough to extinguish this burning flame of her life.",

But not without selling their youth and not without getting screwed relentlessly by a lot of bad guys for a long time.It's not a pretty picture, and it's not a subject most people care about, and it happens all the time everywhere right under our noses.  But that's not the fault of this movie.  I thought the movie was great and right on. A lot of reviewers didn't like the movie because it was too obvious, but really, with the exception of the Lizzie Borden movie Working Girls (no, not the Melanie Griffith movie), how many movies which are not documentaries really take a plain head-on view of prostitution with the rosy colored glasses taken off (and no, I'm not talking Pretty Woman and I'm not talking Showgirls either).  This is a good movie, and it really does the subject justice.  It is a little bit polemic, but it is not pandering or prurient.(Sorry, I couldn't avoid the alliteration: it sought me out!)The depiction of Sweden is not to be missed, by the way, for those of you who think of the country as a smoked-fish and meatballs paradise filled with beautiful, attractive and available blondes.  You definitely get a different side of town when you see this movie.So go see it, it's a good one!  (But only if you really care about this subject.)",

I went alone to the theatre and when I left I felt numb. I was starring out into nothingness while my feet slowly guided me to the nearest bar where I sat down and had several shots and several beers before I called the girl I was dating - she showed up, and after a short discussion we kept drinking in silence while the rain poured down outside.That is the feeling this movie leaves you with. Sort of despair, but more a hunting feeling that no all is right with the world. To this day I cannot hear Mein Herz brennt without tears falling.The acting is phenomenal, Oksana especially. Story grim, heartbreaking, and hunting. But the movie also carries a very important message about human trafficking, and will make you sad but also wake you up to certain realities.With that said this movie is not perfect. The camera is sometimes a bit too shaky, a couple of script issues, and I also thinks the \"last\" scene sort of ruin the feeling of despair and almost ridicule an otherwise brilliant ending, and those angel-wings annoy me...\nI also have the feeling the movie should have been 30min or so longer to give us more of all the characters that, except for Lilja, comes off slightly one dimensional - which is weird since the movie comes off so strong despite of the simplified evil being evil, rapists are just rapists.\nThings sort of just happen and follow a pretty linear path until the heartbreaking ending. I wish there was more about all the characters, more exposition or background. At the end it does not matter too much, all focus is on Lilja and it works brilliantly, but I feel like there is more to the story.I hesitate to call this a masterpiece because there are other movies I regard as better that do deserve that epithet much more and I rarely hand out 10s since I believe such a grade demands close to flawless brilliance, and this movie is not quite there.\nHowever this is a great, great movie and a must see. 9/10 and I highly recommend. If this is not in your library, or you have not seen it, shame on you.",

            "content": "This movie is very sad and depressing, but a very well made movie.The story is about a Former Soviet Russia 16 year town girl Lilja (Oksana Akinshina) who is abandoned by her mother who goes away with her boy-friend to America. Lilja survives for some time with her 13 year old friend Volodya (Artyom Bogucharsky) who also lives on street because he is thrown out by his crazy father. With no money left Lilya takes up to prostitution, and there she meets a boy Andrej (Pavel Ponomaryov) who promises her job in Sweden. In Sweden Lilja is traded as a child slave and forced to engage in prostitution.The movie is based on the real life event of a Russian girl Dangoule Rasalaite who ended up in Sweden as a child slave prostitute after her mother took off to America. The Swedish Director Lukas Moodysson has written this fictionalized story to fit the feature film format. Director Lukas has done a marvelous job in taking out powerful performance from Oksana Akinshina and Artyom Bogucharsky. The intimate scenes between them are the best shot innocent children conversation I have ever seen on the screen. Lukas takes us into the dark realities of life in Former Soviet Russia \u0096 the dis-engaged family structures, the apathy of societal structures and government systems.Oksana has given her once in a life time performance for this role. This story and role was very challenging and it would have taken lots of guts from Oksana and her family to agree to do this character. Kudos to all of them! The real scene stealer is Artyom, and his presence of screen is magical and refreshing. He is a brilliant actor \u0096 and sadly he has not acted in any other movie after that (I hope he does not become a one time wonder boy like Danny Lloyd of Shining movie?) The story is told in such realistic way that my heart went out for Lilja, I felt so helpless and wanted to go and rescue her, take care of her and give her happiness. That is the magic of cinema \u0096 it connects the characters with our heart, and they become so difficult to forget.A special mention of the good musical score by Nathan Larson \u0096 especially the hard rock music in the background; matching and suitable to the years we live in.The only thing I could not understand and amazed me was the dis-jointed family relationships between mother and daughter. I was not able to come in terms with the fact that a mother can leave behind a 16 year old daughter just by herself without anything. I found that very disturbing. I hope it is just a one-off case and not the dark reality of Russia.Hats of to Lukas, Oksana and Artyom! (Stars 7.5 out of 10)",

I have seen three of Lukas Moodysoon's films: \"Together\" and \"Show Me Love\" (I prefer the original Swedish title with F.....g in the title) and this is his absolute masterpiece. All three films have shown that Moodysoon has an incredible talent for knowing exactly where to place the camera. There are other contemporary European directors of my generation with this caliber of talent, including Faith Akin (and, I am not merely saying that because we are both of Turkish descent), Michael Winterbottom and Michael Hanke to name just a few. There is great symbolism and amazing acting here. It is definitely a film which transcends borders and the theme is very timely.

Like most other viewers I had to find a way to alleviate the pain I felt for the young protagonist: watching it at 2x, pausing often, imagining the possibilities she had to fix her problems by violently getting revenge over those that were directly responsible for her situation.Aren't these signs of a powerful movie? A call to action VS injustice, denouncing parents giving birth to children without a solid plan for their future; denouncing nations unable to take care of those in need; denouncing people exploting other people.And while I didn't like what I felt, after the view I found myself like cleansed - not like other movies where the suffering is gratuitous (ie \"Never let me go\" and various torture films now come to mind: any catharsis there or just a roller-coaster of emotional manipulation?). Here true people live through this hell even nowadays. This movie doesn't try to gently convince you about it, it traumatizes you until it hurts, and you - hopefully - become a better person, feeling responsible for doing your small part to prevent these things from happening.Still a movie isn't a pamphlet or a workable social reform: it's at best a cry for attention. But raising awareness isn't what such a raw/niche production is good for. Therefore I judge it as a \"pure\" film and as a film I had a couple of problems with it: most importantly, Lilja isn't a well rounded-character.Overall however it's a great movie to watch: alone, when you feel good and want to dedicate some of your time to people in need for help.",

            "content": "I've seen three recent films dealing with human trafficking: Trade, which was an unbelievable suck-fest; Jammed, from Australia, which was good, way better than Trade; and Lilya 4-Ever.Trade was propaganda nonsense Hollywood style and tried to consciousness-raise that way but it failed miserably because its story was too far fetched. Jammed seemed to want to make you angry. It showed us a lot of how the world of human trafficking works and suffocates the people inside it. Lilya 4-Ever is a much simpler story, sad and dreary.The weather in the film's unnamed Russian locale was awful, foggy and cold, reflecting the life of this poor girl. Lilya's mother leaves her, moves to the States with her new boyfriend, then sends a letter to Social Services renouncing her guardianship of the \"unwanted child\"; her aunt assumes control of Lilya and essentially takes everything away from her for herself and tells Lilya to go downtown and spread her legs; and her best friend, Anna, tells everyone that Lilya is prostituting herself for money in order to cover up the fact that it's really her that is doing it. So she has nothing except the friendship of another child who has been abandoned by life. Ergo ... easy prey.Screen time is devoted almost entirely to Lilya and her 14 year glue sniffing friend Volyada. Both performances are well-executed and believable by these two young people. This is the second film I've seen by Swedish writer/director Lukas Moodysson. The other was Show Me Love. He tells simple stories and I think this helps to get sympathetic performances from his young actors.Of the three trafficking films mentioned here, this one is probably the best, but it is also the least about trafficking. It's a sad story about a simple girl whose life is pulled out from under her.",

Not exactly a nice place to spend your childhood and an even worse place to spend your youth. It's a bleak landscape, with dilapidated communist buildings and disillusioned people. Everyone who has the chance leaves. So does Lilja's mother. Without Lilja. That's just the start of the downward spiral for Lilja. Moodysson doesn't observe her way down from a save platform, but is always right next to her. You identify with her, always hope for her when she is hoping, always laugh with her when she is laughing and always cry with her when she is crying. \"Lilja 4-ever\" is physical cinema, it shakes your whole body. In this case it doesn't matter that the story seems a bit fabricated at times, important is that this film will make it even harder to understand for everyone who sees it how something like this is even possible in the real world.",

Because if you do you hear the dialogue so poorly written as if it was translated from Swedish or English by an amateur, then force-fed to the Russian actors or given to the amateur kid actors to improvise on. Natural my foot! With that kind of dialogue, the characters might as well walk on stilts. It's so awful one can see the not-so-bad actors trying to make it more natural and failing as the camera rolls. Russians just don't speak Russian like that!In fact, instead of a tragedy, this movie looks and sounds like it was made by Ed Wood. It's all in the little details, but they make make the whole movie fake. Lilya, supposedly an Orthodox Christian, prays in front of a definitely non-Orthodox picture (I can't call it an icon). During the first minutes of the movie, Lilya runs toward the huge mud puddle, and it's so obvious she has to fall there. And she doesn't trip, she falls in it like she hits her mark. And one of the most heart-rending moments in the movie looks fake.Lilya, who supposedly knows she has the tickets and the American visa in her passport (otherwise why would she be so sure she was going to America?) suddenly finds out she's not leaving. She's 16, so she's of age in Russia, so she can leave on her own. Lilya, who apparently knows a thing or two how things work in Russia, surrenders her apartment just like that even though Russians have the so-called \"propiska\", a permanent domicile shown in their internal passports (which Lilya has since she's 16). These things just don't work like that and they don't happen like that. Hence, the premise of the movie and what happens in it is simply fake, not real, not natural. One more thing. Most Russian kids like Volodya like soccer, not basketball. Basketball is much less popular. It's like the movie was written with American viewers in mind. In Russia, there is no baseball or American football to speak of, and hockey is out of consideration for various reasons obvious from the movie, so the only sport left is basketball.Well, enough about the bad and the ugly. Here are a few things I liked.\"Mein Herz brennt\" (\"My heart burns\") is such a powerful song. Wow.Pavel Ponomaryov, who plays Andrei, a nice Russian guy Lilya meets who works in Sweden, actually manages to speak and behave naturally, like a Russian would in real life.

What's important is whether or not you care! Fortunately, I cared a lot, probably because I had a heavy crush on Lilya, but there's a bit more to it than that.Lilya just seems to take events on the chin and deal with it in her own way, which is surprising and somewhat inspiring. No hysterics, just an ultimate, immature belief that things are going to improve by taking each little step at a time and making another, probably misinformed, decision.If I was in her situation, would I have reacted in the same way? Would I have had any choice in the matter? These are questions that cannot be answered easily. One minute she's a perfectly normal person, growing up in what seems like a normal family and then, suddenly, she's washed along by the tide of life and its very difficult decision-making process.One of the easiest reviews I've ever written because I feel so clear in my feelings about the film.

            "review_title": "An important film that has humanity, cruelty, and hope",
            "content": "I loved this film. The acting & directing was excellent. Most of the characters were three-dimensional, and portrayed with some humanity (even if they were the cruelest characters). Aunt Anna has a moment of empathy when she rests her hand gently on Lilja's shoulder after yelling at her. Lilja's boyfriend has a moment of sadness when he stares at her after giving her the passport. Lilja herself was generally kindhearted, yet also acted cruelly at times (eg. swearing at the shop keeper, and laughing at her elderly neighbour when she drops some potatoes). All the characters lived in a harsh, impoverished, cold place. Their attitudes towards each other reflected the callousness of their surroundings. It's hard to be kind when you're freezing, poor, lonely, abused/mistreated & miserable. Lilja's boyfriend encourages her to go to Sweden with him, saying, \"They're kind in Sweden. It's not like here.\" After Lilya dies, she comes back as an angel and rewrites some of her last steps. She refuses to go to Sweden to 'pick vegetables' and tells her boyfriend, \"I'm no fool, vegetables don't grow in winter!\", and she kindly helps her horrible elderly neighbour pick up her dropped potatoes.Aunt Anna was an interesting character. At the beginning of the film, she was living in a drafty shack while her sex worker sister was living in a flash apartment (with daughter Lilya). When her sister leaves for America (and abandons Lilya), Aunt Anna takes advantage by kicking Lilya into a horrible apartment, renting the fancy apartment out to someone else, and moving herself into a comfortable home. When Lilya runs out of food & has her power cut off, she begs her Aunt to help her, but her Aunt tells her, \"I'm poor too. I'm an old woman, I'm sick, I'm tired, I just need to be comfortable.\" Aunt Anna seems to be jealous and bitter towards her sister (perhaps she believes that her sister has always had the 'easy' way out financially, by prostituting herself). When Lilya comes knocking on her door, Anna wants Lilya to find out the world is a tough place, and she wants to take her bitterness out on Lilya. She tells Lilya, \"Do what your mother did. Go into town and spread your legs. Now leave me in peace.\" Lilya's mother is interesting, also. It's implied in the film that she became pregnant with Lilya to a man who abandoned her, then needed to prostitute herself in order to provide her herself & Lilya. Lilya's mother has a love-hate relationship with Lilya (perhaps blaming Lilya for everything bad in her life). There is a heart-breaking scene where the mother abandons Lilya to go to America with her boyfriend (both Lilya & her mother are sobbing their hearts out). After being abandoned, Lilya tears up the photo of her mother, then glues it back together. After receiving a letter from her mother (which says that Lilya was 'always an unwanted child'), Lilya burns the photo of her mother, then heads out to the bar and sells her body for the first time.The high point of the film was the friendship & kindness between 16-year old Lilja & 12-year old Volodya. After Lilya is forced to prostitute herself to make ends meet, there is a sweet moment where she gives Volodya a basketball for his birthday, the best present he's ever received. After she is gang raped by some of the neighbourhood boys (who think she deserves it because she's a prostitute), Volodya gathers her clothes for her, sits next to her and rests his head on her shoulder (after offering her some glue). Volodya doesn't trust her boyfriend and repeatedly tells her, \"He just wants to sleep with you.\" After Volodya commits suicide, he turns into an angel and visits Lilya several times (she is now a sex slave in Sweden), trying to comfort her.INTERVIEW WITH THE DIRECTOR: On the DVD there is a fantastic 90-minute interview with the director. He says that: 1. He wanted to protect both the character of Lilja & the actress who plays her. He didn't want to exploit them or expose them in any way (author note: that is fantastic, but unusual. I can't tell you how many times I've seen women sexualised but not humanised on a program like CSI, before being murdered. I end up thinking, \"Wait, that was supposed to be a real woman! Her life was important\", yet I couldn't care less about her because I don't know anything about her (other than that the cameraman thinks that she is a waste of a hot body). If I have to watch a rape scene, I want to see it through the victim's eyes, not through the rapist's eyes (voyeurism, and objectifying/sexualizing the victim). 2. The director wanted the film to be portrayed through Lilja's eyes, so in the rape/prostitution scenes, often Lilja is not even there \u2013 the camera is positioned as if looking through Lilja's eyes. It was so difficult for the cameraman to film some of the scenes, that at one point he couldn't go on, and handed the camera over to the director Lukas \u2013 so Lukas was fully clothed, holding the camera, and filming this (semi) naked man on top of him. He said that that was an extremely uncomfortable, difficult moment (he could feel the man's breath on himself). He said, \"I was going through, maybe 0.1% of what the Lilja's of this world are going through.\" 3. Initially the director planned to have Jesus literally beside Lilya throughout the movie (in retrospect he wonders if Volodya was a metaphor for Jesus). 4. The gender split is usually quite marked in terms of who likes the film & who hates it (the people who really love the film are almost always women, the people who hate the film are almost always men).",

Even now, I'm still thinking about the horrible faith of that poor girl. That has a lot to do with the excellent acting of course. Oksana Akinshina is a complete stranger to me, but her performance was so incredibly good and so believable, that you might easily forget that you are watching a movie instead of a real life documentary. Artyom Bogucharsky as Volodya, Pavel Ponomaryov as Andrej, Liliya Shinkaryova as Lilja's aunt,... None of them is famous or has played in many other movies, but one by one, they play their roles as if they have never done anything else in their entire lives. There are two scenes that you will remember. The first shows us Lilja's face when the men are on top of her. She just lies there, helpless, without any reason to live. The second shows us the faces of the men that are on top of her. This montage lets us see the ugliness of those people, what kind of animals the world knows. 'Lilja 4-ever' is a sad movie, but a good movie. Although we probably know that things like this happen, it is not bad to realize that from time to time. 'Fucking \u00c5m\u00e5l' director Lukas Moodysson makes sure we do that with his movie. The music, as well as the way the camera was handled added very much more to the film. In the opening, the music came on so loud and the camera so shaky, you almost know the film would be unbearably painful (in more ways than one).Powerful as the film is, there are some parts which are admittedly over the top. Having Lilja and Volodya play ball with wings on the roof top is quite whimsical actually. But all said, this was definitely a film worth watching",

In other words: all you're about to see in the next 100 minutes is the downfall of a girl being abandoned, abused and exploited.Lukas Moodysson made himself famous with the way he depicted children dealing with their troubles. But while F*cking Amal was a cheerful movie, Lilya 4-ever is a succession of shocking and even horrifying moments, eventually adding up to the final scene as described above. Lilya 4-ever never makes you feel good as F*cking Amal did: images of Lilya diving in the mud, crying because her mother just left with her boyfriend to the USA, Lilya being insulted and even raped by her own classmates and Lilya gradually becoming a full-time prostitute alternate with each other. Moodysson uses these images to their full extent.This film won't put a smile on your face. Ever. The spare moments where Volodya visits Lilya with the wings on his back are a bit on the cheap side (that explains the 8/10), but the acting is more than convincing. A must-see, this movie.",

Like how the child protective services just let her go without as much as giving her a general outline of what she could do. I doubt that in the Soviet Union of all places there wouldnt be some sort of program to aid orphans. I also dont think that people are as bad as they are portrayed here. Like literally everyone in this film couldnt care less about Liljia or her friend. He literally dies on the stairs to this one apartment building and the old lady that lives there just jumps him. Like who does something like that? The point i'm making is, i see where the film is going with that and i just dont agree and also i think that if you by any chance do not have such an misanthropist point of view on people a lot of this film just does not make sense.

            "content": "There are many vile acts occurring everyday and it is sad to say that a lot of us forget that some people do not have the same luxuries in lifestyle that a lot of us. Films like Lilja 4-ever sum up how sometimes we do need to be shown what is really happening to some of the more unfortunate people in the world. Russian society is a society that is in trouble and has been for many years. There is no denying that Russia is a country which is not quite as in touch with the world as other places. As with everywhere there is crime, though in Russia there is far more crime and criminal activities that are not being dealt with due to the lack of law enforcement.Lilja 4-ever follows the story of a sixteen year-old Russian girl who is abandoned by her mother when her mother decides to leave to America in search of a \"better life\". At first Lilja does not realise this, although quickly comes to the realisation and apparent disownment that her mother has forced upon her. She only has one true friend, a young boy named Volodja. Both are left to fend for themselves and due to the poverty they are living in Lilja has to start selling her body for cash.Lilja 4-ever is one of those film experiences where you will find yourself burning up inside with rage. This is due to the necessary depressing nature that the film brings upon its viewers and the unpleasant realism of seeing the innocent being abused. The film's force is indisputable, though some might accuse the film of being manipulative I feel that manipulation is a required element with a film of such miserable nature. Not only does the film make you feel for its characters, it lets the viewer watch them spiral into destruction forcing you to watch situations quickly turn from bad to worse. Fortunately, there is an element of hope incorporated into the film, although to me it is a surreal fantasy of hope. The flaw is that Lilja 4-ever does not have a genuine resolution and for a film of its nature I believe there should be a clearer resolution. I certainly believe the ending should be a depressing one because then it will have a stronger impact at capturing the brutal realism. Ultimately, Lilja 4-ever is a film that achieves to strike a nerve.Lilja 4-ever is not light-viewing, nor is a film that offers re-watchability. It is a film that clearly states the facts and forces unforgettable imagery into the back of your mind. Though the film might sound explicit, very little is shown on-screen and at least not in a graphic manner. The film's explicitness lies inside the film's themes, characters, atmosphere and occurrences. I consider this a wonderfully intelligent method of making the viewer realise the bare truths of life. Using documentary style shooting techniques and what seems like hand-held camera Lilja 4-ever achieves at creating an unprecedented image of aching pragmatism. The editing is fairly abrupt and stark, helping create a moody atmosphere. The empty and dirty Russian town is captured through bleak camera shots and ultimately succeeded in making me see Russia as an unattractive and poverty-stricken land. One of the technical problems is the music used to accompany some of the scenes; it feels unfitting, bizarre and exaggerated.The acting from both teenagers is magnificent, easily the film's driving force at creating the bleak atmosphere the film holds. Oksana Akinshina gives her performance as Lilja a raw empathy and manages to make you pity what she has become. She is the soul element for the film's powerful nature, she dives inside her character becoming the member of society you would ignore if you saw her in the street.I recommend Lilja-4 ever to people who enjoy watching cinema that makes them think, although a film that for some may be beyond the nature of depression that they feel inclined on viewing. If you are open-minded and like films that are not afraid to delve inside an intense subject matter, then Lilja 4-ever is the film for you. The fact is, Lilja 4-ever represents a sad, honest truth.",

Ostensibly presented as a commentary on prostitution, this is more about the disintegration of human society.Also of note are the performances of teenage actors Oksana Akinshina and Artyom Bogucharsky.",

            "content": "Wow. What was that?  A main character who is so tragic that the director never even feels that it is necessary to MAKE her a character.  There's no development!  She's hardly even a person!  She's just a victim.  Maybe that was the director's intention, to show us, the uneducated viewers, that the world can be a sad and dangerous place, where women and children are often brutalized, but this film is so pretentious, I almost have to RESPECT how little the director cares about being heavy handed!  The political commentary is sophomoric at best, the little kid with angel wings is a joke (which is a shame, because the character of the little boy was the only one the director ever effectively made me feel an affinity for) the dialogue is such a mess, that I can only hope that bad subtitles are to blame, and the scenes of rape and sexual degradation are handled in such a sloppy and predictable way, that they appear to us as a miserable crescendo of indifference and deviance, rather than a descent into the personal hell of an innocent girl who is the casualty of an uncaring world full of male aggressors and predators (which I believe was the director's acual intention).  This is not an original film.  This is hardly even a worthwhile film, other than the fact that its serious subject matter is so poorly mismanaged, that it might prompt bursts of inappropriate laughter.  Its just another martyr film, much like those Lars Von trier has been making, but von Trier's films have interesting characters, characters who have some sense of humanity and imperfecion that the audience is made to identify with. Lilja 4-Ever is a first-year film student's wet dream.  For the sole purpose of enjoyable melodrama, however, this film does function on a base level.  In spite of these issues, I would definately see this film again, because the young man who played Lilja's friend (I believe his character's name was Volodvyk) gave a poignant, heartbreaking performance.  If only it werent warped by Moodyson's retarded and profoundly false vision of a hopeless existence.",

The sign of a quality film is that it gets better on repeated viewings rather than boring....there are more character nuances and artistic and plot points that come to light.  This is such a movie.  Not one for the faint of heart, but for those who want to face reality toe-to-toe, nose-to-nose.  The camera pans of the setting and even the pan-European music really accentuate the angst throughout.  Thematically, the story uncovered the way, especially among the poor, there is no such thing as anything like unconditional love such as these children were looking for and dreaming of.  The teen Lilja only found a glimpse of it in her little friend Volodja and in the end, in her hope of heaven.  May this not only be a commentary and portrait of the prostitution trade and slavery of the underprivileged but shed some light about how the poor might be helped, instead.  So much for socialist idealism in Sweden, eh? [I'm Swedish descent]  Marx is totally dead for lack of human hearts (and lack of God).  God is the only one with unconditional love and the only real source of it.",

(Why is it that children seem so often to be more skilled actors than adults?)The film itself is surely one of the most depressing you're apt to see anytime soon.It wasn't pleasant sitting in the theater wishing, from the very first frames, that I could help the poor children have a better life, but it's a testimony to the power of the film and the skill of its makers that I felt that way throughout.  I was intrigued by similarities to Robert Bresson's 1966 \"Mouchette,\" which by bizarre coincidence I'd watched on VHS just the night before seeing \"Lilja 4-Ever.\"  The general story outline, the sullying of clothing in mud, the bumper-car ride, the deception by a betraying adult, and of course the ending of the film all mirrored (though not exactly) the Bresson film, as though this movie were a kind of tribute to the earlier one.  Which is fine with me, but roused my curiosity.Certainly a film worth seeing, one that will probably trouble the viewer for a long time afterward, and one that, a facilitator at the film festival where I saw it told us, helped to get laws about human trafficking toughened in the European Union.",

Many sing the praises of TOGETHER, no less than Ingmar Bergman has called SHOW ME LOVE a masterpiece, I believe this is Moodysson's best work, largely due to the way in which he brings to the forefront such socially relevant issues.

I appreciate the immediacy this director brings to a subject that is filled with too much heartbreak when it happens to you.\nThis film bears a resemblance with the nearly unwatchable 9 minute rape sequence in IRREVERSIBLE, but here, the child sexual victimization continues for an uncountable number of days, leading ultimately to the same end. The violence is portrayed with a montage of assault after assault of male bodies.  In IRREVERSIBLE, we hear the unforgettable sound of the woman's anguish; here, the girl is silent while the sounds and noises of the assembly line of men is a violent, continuous punishment to the senses, one of the most despairing sequences anyone could endure.Put yourself in her position, the filmmaker may ask.  Multiply that by the thousands or millions of teens around the world in similar situations, then one begins to imagine the magnitude of what's being examined here in this film.

Actually there were little brief offerings of hope throughout this film.  I loved the innocent interplay between the two abandoned children, also the imagery of an equally innocent heaven.  But for a 16 year old, who's not even old enough to be allowed entrance into the theater, again - she continually has \"hopes,\" of America, of Sweden, of getting out of school, of finding a friend, of getting away, of getting a job, of finding love, of being free. I thought Oksana Akinshina as Lilya was simply stunning, even more so because she was able to make me believe she was not selfish; she was kind, still innocent, all the more significant for the unbelievable sequence of living behind a locked door. I could barely contain myself, witnessing what no one should ever endure, but there it was - impossible to turn away from, the revolt and disgust happening before our eyes.  In the duty-free shop at the airport, where she was left on her own, and she was thinking of dressing herself up for the trip, I was reminded of the Jews who similarly dressed in their finest, having no idea what was in store for them during their hellish WWII transport.

Well it's more than that.  The severity of the subject matter, which includes an extremely naturalistic portrait of two teen suicides, is in fact relentless, and is justifiably serious throughout.  This is one of the best films I've ever seen on the subject of teen suicide, actually laying down an argument in favor of taking one's life, which, I think, separates it from other films on the subject, including ROSETTA, not to suggest one should, but respecting the indisputable fact that so many children do decide to take their own lives, asking how can that be, and in that vein, it bears a very strong resemblance, at least in the seriousness of tone and subject matter, with Fassbinder's IN A YEAR OF 13 MOONS.

I'm with the latter camp.This movie, to me, is like a really, really unhappy, ugly version of Wings of Desire, where the angel doesn't come to earth for the girl, the girl is sucked into death. The plot of the movie, by the way, is Lilya is this Russian teenager living in a nasty barren apartment wasteland \"somewhere in the former Soviet Union,\" her mom ditches her to go to America, her aunt kicks her out of the apartment to live in squalor, she ends up dropping out of school and selling herself and... well, she ends up in Sweden and let's just say, things get worse. Despite the theme, this really is a beautifully done film and unlike say, Dancer in the Dark, a film that left me nauseous and angry for three days, I wasn't mad at the director, I was proud of him for putting together a portrait of the kind of despair that is all too common in the world. It's half documentary, a quarter nightmare, a quarter dream. And you care about this girl so much b/c nobody does except for one person and nobody cares for him either... Groan.

Unreal that the world had to go through the communist nightmare, that still had consequences even after its fall.

Labeling is so easy when you do not know the story behind, and Lilja shows us such a sad story behind her fate. A grim fate decided for her, from which it seems there would have never been a good route.

Incredibly unlike the warmth of that movie, Lilja 4ever rocked my world!! This movie is about a young unwanted girl, that gets ditched by her mother and stepfather(whom goes to America for the good life), and is left in Mother Russia under the negligent attention of a selfish aunt that kicks her out of her apartment and moves in herself, whilst Lilja gets confined to a tiny dirty apartment, who's former occupant died in. Lilja's a good christian girl, and is led astray to prostition. From then on Hell begins.The movie does portray men as pigs, true.. but only the boy Volodja, and briefly a poorly educated and somewhat helpless social worker shows any real sign of humanity. So this isn't a movie about evil men in particular. Just humanity in general, at its very worst. The swedish familiyman pretending Lilja was his daughter, before sodomizing her will probably haunt me for a while.The World is sick, and this movie insistently reminds us.",

Of course this film wasn't supposed to be any fun. A Film to enlighten ourselves on whats really going on in our border countries.-- BELOW PLOT -- The main character Lilja is excellently played by Oksana Akinshina, an actress who I'm sure we'll see more of in the future. In the movie we meet a young girl with the naive dream about moving to America together with her mom and her mom's new found man. She feels really relieved about leaving her poor life behind and start a new.But her mother leaves her behind with no family, no money. She finds her her only friend a younger boy which she shares her problems with. She goes with a schoolmate to a club, because her friends knows how to earn money. When Lilja discovers what she is getting paid for she flees the place. She gets visited by her schoolmate and her father who accuses Lilja getting his daughter into prostitution. Lilja is hated by everyone at the school, being a cheap prostitute. But in all darkness she finds a nice guy she fall in love with, with promises moving to Sweden. But in Sweden is another much older man waiting for her and locks her up in a apartment. And make her earn money for him. This movie tells a real sad and depressing story. And I hope that this movie makes people be more aware of the trafficking situation. It's a quite strong movie.",

            "content": "[ story outline below, might be considered by some to contain spoilers ]Gripping film in semi-documentary style (handheld cameras most of the time, giving the observer a somewhat impartial and detached, but explicit and merciless view of the situation - the story line is entirely linear in structure) about a young Russian girl, Lilya, whose mother decides to look for a better future in America, much to Lilya's enthusiasm. Her mother fails to tell her, until the last possible moment, that Lilya's not coming along. She will send for her later. All she really does send is a letter to the local Social Services, telling them that Lilya is an unwanted child, and that she no longer wishes to be considered her mother.\nLilya, who had tried to live her life as normally as possible until then, even going to school, sees the bottom fall out from under her existence. Together with her equally forlorn younger male friend, Volodya, she tries to make ends meet, but her life starts spiraling downwards, faster and faster.\nThe next station is prostitution in a local club. There she meets what she perceives to be her guardian angel, a boy named Andrei. He is a 'loverboy' of course, wooing and courting her, and promising to provide for her and to get her a well-paid job in Sweden. To Lilya, that is as close to America as she can get, so she accepts immediately, eager to escape from her bleak surroundings. Using a simple lie, Andrei sends her on to Sweden by herself, where she will be awaited by her 'future boss'. At the same time, Volodya, consumed by loneliness and overcome by a feeling of total abandonment, overdoses on pills, and dies.Lilya arrives in Sweden, all smiles, ready for a brighter tomorrow. Until her passport is taken away from her and she gets locked inside her apartment, that is. The next day, all becomes clear. She is held against her will, mentally and physically abused, isolated by language, and driven around as a prostitute by her 'future boss', who is a pimp catering to local tastes. All she gets in return is a diet of burgers and Coke.\nShe tries to maintain a modicum of sanity (and to relieve her guilty feelings about leaving him behind) by inventing the presence of Volodya (complete with angel wings), trying to hang on to happier and less worrying days.When she finally manages to escape, she has no idea what to do and where to go. In a blind panic, caused by a sudden encounter with the police, she jumps from an overpass on to the highway. She barely survives, and gets rushed to hospital. In her dying seconds, she has a dream, in which she undoes the decisions that led her there, undoing everything bad that has happened to her until that moment.Finally, she is reunited with Volodya, and they 'die happily ever after', playing like the children they really are.This is a no-frills story, told in a straightforward and sometimes brutal manner, and one feels for Lilya and Volodya, even though the film does nothing to evoke that emotion. Their fates are understandable, and probably unavoidable.Stories like these can be told hundreds, maybe thousands of times every year. The story of 'sexploitation' needs to be told, and when it is being told this well, it needs to be seen.",

You feel powerless, because you know that always and in every country woman will be the victim of man who earn their money in sex business. You want to cry it out, like Rammstein does in the beginning of the film: \"Mein Herz brennt!\". But in a few scarce moments it is also a film of a real friendship between Lilja and the boy Volodya.

Any how I got it through a friend and I started to watch this movie without any expectations. And gosh!, hardly 5 minutes into the movie, tears were already rolling down my cheeks.The film is gentle yet it has many harsh realities encoded with it. Top notch performances of actress Oksana Akinshina (who portrayed Lilja) and actor Artyom Bogucharsky (Volodya) steer the movie to the verge of perfection. Tender romantic sequences between both of them are a must watch. Reall after seeing this movie I fell in love with the actress Oksana. The film has extremely dark moments handled in a very subtle manner.Here go some of the touching scenes in the movie,1)When Lilya tells her friends that she is going to America. 2) When she tells a final good bye to her mother and in the next scene she falls down and cries. 3) When Volodya asks her whether he can kiss Lilya and when she rejects fells sorry that he wasn't born two years earlier. 4) Later, when Volodya acts as if he fainted due to drugs and when Lilya kisses him. 5) The scene in which Lilya's friend tells her father that Lilya is a prostitute. 6) When Lilya keeps on writing on the bench when the local hoodlums call her obscenities. 7) When she meets the new boy friend who promises her that he will take her to Sweden. 8) When Lilya actually starts to leave to Sweden and Volodya runs away without even telling bye to her and later commits suicide. (the best one in the movie) 9) The scene in the duty free shop when she for the first time sees the inside of a true super market. 10)When she is raped by her employer the very next day she reaches Sweden. 11) The scenes in which the bodies of men who have sex with Lilya are shown,indicating the ugliness she was experiencing. 12) The scenes in which she has dreams that Volodya is talking to her. 13) The scene in which Volodya tells Lilya, \"You will be dead for a whole eternity, but be on the earth for a brief moment. 14) When Lilya breaks the picture which she worships one day out of despair. 15) The last scene in which she is shown as an angel along with Volodya where both of them play basketball.Well, to be frank telling that these are the only worth watching in the movie would be very unfair, in fact the whole movie is a master piece and every scene is so well worked that it will become your favourite. I could have written a hundred points and still be incomplete.Finally, Lilja 4 Ever is a movie for sensible people who like tragic movies and also to people who love to watch movies of other countries.Lilya 4 Ever is a piece of tragic poetry.Cheers!",

Lilya is a classic victim: young, abandoned by her family, barely scraping by in a VERY run-down Soviet-era apartment block in a nameless city in post-USSR Russia. A \"nice guy\" dates her, treats her with seeming respect, and the next thing she knows, she's on her way to Sweden (where her \"boyfriend\" will join her \"shortly\", of course...) for the \"good job\" he's found for her. I'm sure you know what happens next. The acting by both the young Russian actress who plays Lilya and the even-younger boy who plays Volodnya (her only real friend) is absolutely outstanding. (NOTE: If you're expecting nudity by this actress, you'll be sorely disappointed. There are NO nude scenes at all by her, although earlier, in a Russian night club, you see a couple topless go-go dancers with pasties over their nipples.

Moodysson is not Russian, he just does not get it: the Russian of these actors sounds as it is from the 18th century, they overact, they do not curse and use euphemisms where Russians usually curse.No, I am serious -she is a tough girl according to the script, but she never curses, and sounds as Pushkin's heroine!So another fake from the foreigner.

Moodyson first wanted to make \"Fucking \u00c5m\u00e5l\" (aka All about Love) in the same way, but changed it into the successful standard-drama, and that this film is  moving away from drama to a more descriptive, epic, realism is clearly deliberate and not due to an inability to write a narrative.

Made me sad, angry, made me feel helpless and weak. During this story that seems to be a passion I felt like screaming \"no, don't do it. Be careful\"\u0085 in vain. You won't find respite. You start to understand. This story will cover you in a cape of darkness. The days of light are over. But before we see if Lilja jumps or not Lukas Moodyssons takes us to the time and place where the breakup starts. The story is plain, clear and without a shadow of a doubt a forcefully narrated melodrama but still drawn through with a different kind of seriousness. Almost oneiric told, it reminds you sometimes of the movies of Robert Bressons with which it shares the same religious subtexts. Moodyssons name was put on the map with his blitheful sensitive movies \"Fucking \u00c5m\u00e5l\" and \"Tilsammen\". Already in these movies the director proved himself as someone with a grasp for leading young actors and showing their juvenile interior view, the only ones he takes serious in his movies. The adult world seems like a nightmare. From the very beginning you can see a foreshadowing in Liljas 15 year old face. Lilja. This Russian girl in the Ukraine. Where once the Sovjet Union was powerful now ruins assign the landscape. The promised land is called US of A. Lilja's mother also wants a re-start. And when she gets the chance to, she even leaves her only child behind. Lilja is left in a world where homo homini lupus est. Moodyssons always manages to make a connection to the western world. Shows us, we are somehow responsible for the situation Lilja is stuck in without losing the focus on the girl and us feeling sorry for her. Most haunting here is Lilja's hunger for happiness, her childish hoping and an angelesque innocence. And nevertheless she is lost: She loses her home, tries drugs, grows lonely, sinks into poverty, gets betrayed multiple times and ends up as an illegal prostitute in Sweden. She tried to be away from all that so hard though. In one scene we see her throwing away a certain amount of \"dirty\" money she got from a \"friend\" although she needs it so much. A typical Moodyssons scene. He is in love with his characters and in this case also in their agony\u0085 The only friend Lilja has is an unloved little boy. And he is the only one who tries to save her in his own way. But the tragedy recaps. Like her mother left her, Lilja leaves her friend, who commits suicide. The actress who plays Lilja- Oksana Akinshina- does an awesome job. Lilja appears smart and real. Stylistically Lilja 4 ever is narrated fast and straight-lined. What starts like a Popmovie gets more and more penurious and concentrated. The main focus is on Lilja. Every now and then the camera deepens in her face. The is music like the roller-coaster of emotions the viewer is in; from Vivaldi to t.a.T.u. to Alphaville to Rammstein\u0085 Lilja is escaping more and more into a dreamworld. At the end we see all the right decisions that have not been made in this life. And then Lilja is done, standing on a bridge. \"Mein Herz brennt\"",

Lukas Moodyson has cast this movie perfectly, with spot on performances from even the bit parts, and produces a chokingly grim atmosphere that really gives a sense of what it must be like to live where these characters do. The use of music, alternating between heartbreaking strings and pounding electronica which is at somehow at once alienating and filled with joy, really carries the viewer emotionally.But I was very disappointed with the use of angel symbolism in a story that is otherwise so thoroughly realist...it made me question many of the other moments in the movie where one might accuse Moodyson of taking things too far. I love magical realism, but if that is what Moodyson is going for here I think it falls flat.I am being picky, but only because this movie was so so good in so many ways, and it could have been near perfect simply by not taking that step too far.",

            "content": "One of the aims of Cinema and Art in general is to make us think. Director Lukas Moodysson accomplishes this honourably. \"Lilja 4-ever\" blows us away and opens our eyes so we don't forget the problem of child (and teenage) sexual and physical abuse and neglect.Lilja, an adolescent girl living \"somewhere in the former USSR\", as we are told earlier in the film, is always let down by those she trusts the most. First, her mother, followed by her aunt, then her best friend. The only person she can count on is Volodya (played by Artyom Bogucharsky, a very talented young actor), a smaller boy who is constantly mistreated by his father, running to her side when things get rough. She becomes smitten with a charming young man who later reveals that he wasn't the gentleman she thought he was. He presents to her the ultimate deceit, which seals her Destiny and ruins what is left of her miserable existence.The characters in \"Lilja 4-ever\" are very realistically depicted, you see it like it is, even though there is no explicitness. It's a tense drama which holds our attention all the time. Perhaps some people might say it's a tad slow, which is probably an intentional trick of the director, making us see the stagnation in the main characters' lives.Actress Oksana Akinshina (Lilja) shall have a brilliant career ahead of her, if there is any justice in this world, for she shines throughout the film. Hers is a convincing, soulful and moving performance.Thumbs up to Mr. Moodysson, he surely knows what he is doing and he undeniably is one of the best directors/writers of our time. I also recommend \"Fucking Amal\", which is a lighter film by the same director, but utterly relevant nonetheless.My rating - 10 out of 10.",

What I must say is that i cannot find very much that is unique in this movie.I have read quite a lot about trafficking and what has been filmed here is nothing but a typical case of girl/woman being tricked to come to Sweden, gets locked in and has to sell her body. Everything in this movie, including her mom leaving, her aunt being mean to her, she selling her body in Russia, she getting tricked to Sweden, locked in and used as a whore and even the suicide was predictable - as that was the first thing we saw. All of this could be seen in any documentary about trafficking, and I have seen several of those.This takes away much of the charm in this movie. The acting however is quite good, and everything around the main story might be interesting enough to keep you watching.But overall, this is not a great film. The reason it has gotten so good reviews here on IMDB is that the ones thinking its a great movie doesnt know much about the real world - and because of that they are getting chocked. Anyone who knows how trafficking works and how usual it is wont get chocked, and thus will not think this movie is that great.My rating: 6/10.",

This is the kind of film in which a child kneeling at a door to eavesdrop reminds one of the complexity neo-realism has, all but foresaken by most contemporary cinema (YI YI had that kind of casual impact, and the best Iranian films).   A 15 second image of kids squatting in an abandoned factory, reading transcripts of Soviet party congresses in utter mystification, achieves an off-handed elegy for a near-century of Russian history.",

When i was explaining to people about why i like it, they thought 'why would i like a film that's about the downfall of a girl into prostitution?'. The answer is this: 16-year-old Lilya's emotions are powerfully represented by the actress who plays her, Oksana Akinshina and it makes the film enthralling to watch. The girl starts off living in a poor village in Russia with her friend Volodja (who almost seems like a brother) when things start looking up for her. Her boyfriend tells her they can escape to Sweden where they can live happily. Volodja doesn't want her to go as he'll be all alone so takes an overdose of drugs when she decides to leave. Meanwhile, Lilya is set to go to Sweden with her boyfriend but he gets called away so Lilya goes on her own and plans to meet him later on. However, her boyfriend has signed her over to a pimp in Sweden and when she gets there, she finds out the truth on the next morning when her so-called landlord (the pimp) rapes her. Over the next few days, she meets many men, and no matter how many showers she takes, she can't get rid of them and her feeling of being dirty. We see Lilya quickly shatter, become ruined and hate her life. The actress superbly knows when to cry to emphasise the distraught emotions and when to look on the rare bright side of things. In the end, i honestly felt happy that she'd killed herself to escape the pimp. In 'heaven' Lilya meets up with Volodja and everything is good and happy. The director, Lukas Moodysson strangely uses over-sized angel wings to show they're in heaven. But it's a good effect to show that the character's are finally happy and free. Overrall a great film, even if the theme seems depressing. I recommend it to everyone.",

Lilja 4-ever reminded me a great deal of the equally powerful Sex Traffic where Anamaria Marinca plays a Romanian girl, \"who is kidnapped and trafficked with her sister, through Romania, Serbia,Albania, Bosnia and Italy to the dark side of London.\" For Marinca's character Elena, there was at least some comfort in sharing her ordeal with her sister Vara.

Lilja 4-Ever is a an amazingly authentic and chilly masterpiece quite unlike Moodysson's previous work (Fucking \u00c5mal aka Show Me Love, and Together). The movie is about child prostitution, about friendship and loneliness, hope and disillusionment, trust and distrust.The excellent choice of topic aside, what makes this movie stand out from any other movie I've seen (including many Dogma movies) is that it seems to have no color, no bias, it is so naked, so transparent and minimalist, exposing an aspect of reality in its full awfulness, but doing so in a stronger way than a documentary would. The movie itself is never in the foreground, it's even like the movie didn't exist. This is an amazing achievement by Moodysson.Lilja 4-Ever made me realize how pathetic my own little problems are.

Abandoned by her mother and bullied by former friends, she teams up with Volodja, a homeless boy. Together they spend the days sniffing glue, until Lilya falls in love with a young attractive man. In a scene not totally unlike that when her own mother left her to go to America, Lilya leaves Volodja behind to start a new life in Sweden - a paradise according to her boyfriend. Unfortunately, Sweden is not the answer to her dreams. Lilya is slowly pushed towards a precipice of dread and hopelessness..It's interesting to note that \"the west\" (Sweden, in this case) is depicted as being just as gloomy as \"the east\" (Lilya's home somewhere in the former Soviet Union). The only difference is, as was said in a review in some magazine I read, \"a few strokes of paint on the walls\".\nThe movie becomes even more powerful considering it is loosely based on a true story; Dangoule Rasalaite came to Sweden in the autumn of 1999, hoping for a better life. She commited suicide in january 2000, 16 years old. And for those who complained about Lilya 4-ever being too dark; I think reality can me even worse..Some people have also complained about Lilya 4-ever being predictable and pretentious.

This is drastically shown in the scene where the rich nice-looking family father with the BMW forces Lilja to play a nice school kid before having brutal sex with her.I think 'Lilja 4-ever' is really worth being seen but for me it is sometimes too depressing and shows too little hope.

Regrettably he cannot confront the threat that will separate him from the only thing in the world he loves; Lilya. Nor can he prevent the progression of Lilya's demise.Other reviews will give the plot and awesome soundtrack.I think the writer director erred. He had already made his impact. The McDonalds packet at the kitchen sink is a symbol of a path previously trodden by another captive. I think the director should have offered a glimmer of hope to our Lilya.

Right from the beginning of the film, accompanied by Rammstein's \"Mein Herz brennt,\" foreshadows the end of her horrific ordeal. The main character finds herself trapped in a bleak, post-communist prefabricated housing estate without any prospects and abandoned by her mother. There is not much left of socialist solidarity and everyone tries to save his own skin. Ultimately, the main character, brilliantly played by Oxana Akinschina, drifts deeper and deeper into a maze of intrigues and prostitution. Her only way out seems an escape to the West, but this too turns out to be a delusion and she completely degenerates into an object that sexually frustrated Westerners use purely for their perverted purposes. The sole freedom she has left is ultimately found through her suicide.It sounds like a bad nightmare, but sadly the film realistically paints a dark picture of our society far from Hollywood embellishment. All of this becomes even more sinister when you consider that the film is based on a true incident, the life of 16-year-old Lithuanian Danguole Rasalaite who committed suicide by throwing herself off a bridge in 2000 after serving as a sex slave for months in Sweden.",

I'm pretty easy going as a person, although I know what people can go through because I'm a mental health provider and I see it everyday (or most days at least).To cut to the chase, we get this poor teen girl 15-16 yo, who lives on the fringes of her society, trying to find her way, trying find who she is, trying to fit in, trying to have fun while doing it. She gets into a streak of very bad luck. Her mother abandons her, she has to live in a squalid apartment, her next guardian (her aunt) is abusive, she is doing poor in school (although it doesn't seem like she was trying very much), and people blame her for prostituting herself when it was her (best?) friend who really did it. Along the way she meets this younger boy, Volodja,( who is also trying to find his way, being abused too by his parents, and they make a connection. Well, the next bit of bad luck befalls her, she decides to take a chance on this new friend she meets and travels to Sweden to start a new life with him. Well, turns out it was a scam, and she becomes a sex slave for this monster named witek (I'm not going to dignify this character by capitalizing his name). He has her locked in an apartment which locks from the outside only (she can't get out). He tells her that he would kill her if she tried to escape or send his people to \"wait on\" her and kill her back in Russia if she did escape. During this time, the ghost of Volodja appears to her and helps her get through this period. All this is leading up to the ultimate climax, or should I properly label it, anti-climax of the film.Now the ghost of Volodja somehow helps her to realize that witek forgot to lock the door one day, and she leaves, and freedom was hers. Her luck has just changed for the better. Happy moment right? WRONG! NO, for some God Awful reason, instead of being happy that she is free, Lilja becomes more upset, runs away from people who could have helped her (the police), and commits suicide. I guess she liked bad luck and wanted it to keep going. This didn't make sense to me. Why would someone who has just been freed from a horrible situation do this? Along with killing the main character of this film, this killed almost all my appreciation of the movie. To offer several analogies, Imagine: 1)In the movie Rocky, Just before the big fight, Rocky freaks out and kills himself, end of movie.2)In The Count of Monte Cristo, After escaping from the prison that he's spent 13 years in, Dantes just gives up and kills himself, end of movie.3)In Pulp Fiction, after Bruce Willis refuses to take a dive in the fight and becomes the target of the mob, he doesn't run, he freaks out instead and jumps off a bridge, end of movie.4)Even in the famous Russian movie \"Moscow does not believe in tears\", which I enjoyed and which is rated LOWER than this movie, the main character becomes pregnant, but the father refuses to acknowledge her nor the baby. She doesn't have the baby, persevere, and work her way to the top. No, she freaks out and jumps off a bridge.There are countless other analogies I could draw. My point is... up until the end, this movie was perfectly fine. The end just ruined it. I think this movie is only half way done, and the second half just wasn't made. It is a good half film. And for that I will only rate it 5/10. I encourage anyone else who agrees with me to do similar because if we continue to rate this kind of movie high, more of it's kind will be made. Do we really want more half-movies made? Also, what does it tell people who are stuck in tough situations like this? Well, just commit suicide and everything will be fine? NO NO NO NO NO.Now Moodysson, you just go back and make that second half. We'll all be waiting patiently.",

Though very well acted, it didn't feel new in any way. We stay too close to Lilja herself and \"her\" world; the film would have benefited from opening up more and showing us some of the \"normal\" world outside, thus bringing out the horror of her situation more. It lacked that perspective of comparison and felt instead very claustrophobic. Also the adult characters - who were they and how could they do the things they did? We got zero insight into them which was a pity. How does her pimp / slave-driver sleep at night? That would have been an interesting film.Well, I guess it was HER story.. To sum up, pretty good but ,personally, not all that it's cracked up to be and something of a missed opportunity for Lukas Moodyson. His best is surely yet to come..",

Situations like that depicted in this excellent movie are disarming, still overwhelming modern societies, where people are more used to material things up to the worst and degrading ones - such as, sex at whatever price and the \"use\" of a person's body as though ti was a mere object!... - and less and less to the inner values and sorrows of human beings, their essence, which goes beyond the physical features and touches the soul and everything which is affecting it. Economic crisis aside and all the negative problems stemming from it (herein, exploitation of young folks, whether girls or boys), the Russian people has still a little of something the individualistic money-driven \"Western societies\" have not anymore: natural values and whatever is linked to them, such as persons as incarnated souls, well before than physical human beings.

Lilja is a beautiful, thoughtful young girl who doesn't know what is ahead of her. She lives in a poverty stricken area in Russia, and is abandoned by her mother, the only person she has in the world apart from her friend Natasha, who also betrays her to save her own reputation. Her only friend ends up being a young homeless boy named Volodya, who idolises Lilja and would do anything for her. They only have each other is the poverty stricken area they live in. Things seem to look up when Lilja meets a charming young gentleman who vows to love her and get her a better life in Sweden with his \"boss\". With nothing to lose, Lilja accompanies him and ends up in a situation worse than the one she was already in. In some way, I feel I relate to the character who plays Lijia and I don't think I'm alone. I've seem the movie twice now and each time I've ended up in tears. The performance by both Lilja, and her friend Volodya is beautiful, and really says something about the way people live, not only in regards to trafficking, but also to anyone who has lived in despair and has felt helpless at some point in their life.

After watching the trailer on swedish television and reading previews in swedish magazines, I couldn't let go, so I saw it the day after the swedish premier. I did indeed have expectations, and luckily I wasn't disappointed. This one's a gem! Not just a swedish gem, but an european gem that should be released widely over the world as any other film. This is NOT your usual independent dogma film, or whatever you like to call it. This is a work of art that everybody should see at least once. The plot centers about a russian girl and her traficking destiny. You probably know the plot already, after reading all the other reviews on IMDb. But you should know that this movie centers around a very explicit, hard and sad concept. If you don't cry during the movie your probably a heartless demon. As a swede, I haven't been as proud about the swedish movie industry until now. Lukas Moodysson is a truly great director, that really could make it internationaly just like Lasse Hallstr\u00f6m.

That doesn't mean I didn't liked it and of course doesn't mean that it's a bad movie. It's not a bad movie, but it's an... \"easy\" movie. I'm not sure if it's the right word (sorry, English is not my native tongue). There are many problems with young society these days and each time a director makes a movie focused on these problems, people say it's great. I give you the example of \"Precious\" and \"Juno\". I guess that what makes these movies so acclaimed is the brutal realism of the pictures (not particularly the case of \"Juno\") and the fact that only a few directors aboard this subject. I call it an \"easy\" movie because of that. All you have to do is get yourself a chocking subject, some decent actors and there you go. People get chocked and you get recognition. I wasn't chocked, but I was touched. Let's face it, this recipe never fails, and it didn't failed with me. The acting was good, and the director did a good job (altough he did some strange zoom-in (but it's always interesting to see something different)). The realism from the pictures was the best part. Honestly, I think this should have been nominated for Best Foreign Language Movie.Watch this movie. If you already watched this type of movies, you won't be blown away, it's a bit similar but with a different story.

The \"Pentagon\" in Paldiski was construction yard of submarines which were able to carry and launch nuclear heads.During the last decade hundreds of Estonian (and other _current_ EU member countries) young woman from poor families have been persuaded with hope and better life into districts of US and EU, but the schematics have been always the same. Thy are promised descent life, but in reality it is turned out to be narcotics courier or prostitutes, the passport is taken and they are given the opportunity to \"earn themselves out\" after about 5 years of \"good work\". This film reflects this reality pretty good! Don't take this as entertainment, but as documentary! This will be always the issue neighbouring poor countries and rich ones, only the schematics will change after a while.",

You follow the life of Lilja as she gets abandonded by her mother and her daily struggle to survive. Finally she meets Andrei who promise her a new and better life in Sweden.

            "content": "This is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time.Lilya lives a normal life (mum + mum's boyfriend) in a crappy neighborhood. Suddenly her mum decides to leave to the US with the boyfriend to the US, leaving Lilya alone. The mum says she'll call Lilya sometime to ask her to come to the US but tells her own boyfriend otherwise (\"it's just us\"). So the mum abandons Lilya in the apartment. The mum leaves her daughter some money, enough for one trip to the convenient store, but not enough to pay the rent. Lilya refuses to hug her mom, but then changes her mind and runs dramatically to the car for a hug. She screams \"mama! mama!\" and tears flow from both. She then slides into the mud on her knees in slow motion (no really, in slow motion), covered in mud, crying, as the mum drives off. Then a dog comes (still in slow motion) to the filthy Lilya covered in mud crying on her knees.That was the first sign that this is a terrible film. It was so poor that I almost recommend to people to watch it. But don't.Lilya is forced to move to her aunt's house because no one can pay the rent. The aunt takes her to an absolute dump where the previous tenant died. The aunt says it's warm, there's a fridge, running water, etc. The next day the power goes out because the aunt didn't pay the bill. So no hot water, no fridge, no heat, no light. Lilya has to use candles from now on.If you feel that that isn't contrived, just wait, it gets better. I'm still in the first part of the film. The real story didn't get started yet.So Lilya goes out with her friend who tells her of easy money being a prostitute. When her friend got caught with the money, she told her dad that it was Lilya's money, that Lilya is a prostitute. Her dad makes her return the money. Now everyone calls Lilya a whore. People throw things at her. She can't walk on the street anymore, so she runs home. That's when she discovers the power is out. It just gets worse and worse.This is pure exploitation. It's tragedy porn. There is zero subtlety in this film. There's a scene in the first 15 minutes where an 11 year old boy attempts suicide, just to add to the crap. He is thrown out of the house by his mad father. He smokes glue and dreams of a wife baking him fresh bread. Moodysson found a way to sell people a crappy film with a Russian veneer and everyone is falling for it. His other films are right here to see on IMDb. Container 5.2/10. A Hole in My Heart 4.6/10. He makes some shorts, a TV movie, a documentary. This is his third feature film.He made a film about refugees, he made one about pornography, he made another one about prostitution (and AIDS? - Mammoth 2009), so this one is just another in the same vein or should I say formula?If you really want to watch something from this director, watch \"We Are the Best!\" - possibly an accidental success in his career.",

This movie captures that - it does not simply deem the theme of \"despair\" to be driving a dramatic reenaction of daily Russian life - IT IS a reenaction of it, unlike Hollywood's depiction of suburbia as a \"regular\" backdrop. The movie is character driven, and the characters do not present themselves as anything more then humans responding to the world they inhabit - not dreamers of glory, of better ideals - which is prevalent in Western cinema. The pretense is, that there is nothing above and beyond reality. You know who the main character is - it is you now, two, five, ten years ago - searching for meaning. But searching in a world which wants to rip open its skin and ship itself elsewhere - anywhere but where it is now. Sadly the main character takes her world past innocence to monotonous immoral co-existence to a completely new locale to choke out what little life was left in the detrimental shrine to life she has erected in her homeland.

You will surely sit pinned to the chair during the whole screening, but when you walk out the theater the tears will most certainly come.One of the few movies I can compare to this one, in meaning of the subject (prostitution, and ill-treatment of young children) is the equally dark movie \"Care\". Unfortunately that movie was made for TV only.The best thing about this movie are the actors/actresses. Oksana Akinshina and Artiom Bogucharskij are so natural and real when they act, so you feel like your among them, in their harsh surrounding. That realism make the movie so very lifelike, that I can't recall any movie that can match it in real-life-likeness.*** SPOILER STARTS NOW! ***The movie starts with Lilja running from something, we don\u00b4t know what. Her face is beaten up and she runs a little unsteady. Then we\u00b4re brought back three months in time, to somewhere in the former Soviet Union. Lilja's mother has found some new lover, and they are planning to go to the States. But somehow Lilja is left behind, only 15 years old and, of course, without an income. From there, her life gets harder and harder. The last half of the movie, is a very emotionally cruel part, it's filled with prostitution, human-trafficking and such tragic events.*** SPOILER ENDS NOW! ***Rating 10/10",

            "content": "I saw Fucking \u00c5m\u00e5l years ago,  and only caught up with Tillsammans the other day on video. What amazed me about both those films was Moodysson's ability to flesh out depth out of the most  trite, predictable situations. Tillsammans in particular managed to juggle an  enormous number of characters, while giving each one of them a vague but distinct personality, rather than resorting to plugging each one into stereotypes. Lilja 4-Ever is similar in that aspect. A not-so distant cousin to Kusturica's \"Time  of the Gypsies\", it replaces that movie's magical-realist depiction of postcommunist squalor with a decidedly starker one. It also depicts the gamut of scenes you might expect for a movie that's (ostensibly) about the underage eastern European sex trade, yet, somehow, these scenes never feel flat or overdone. I don't know if it's the performances (and both of the film'sleads are  fantastic, completely naturalistic and believable), Moodysson's ability to keep  things going at a brisk pace while leaving enough time for remarkably tender,  moving moments, or his boldness (most evident in his ballsy decision to include a fantastically corny element towards the end of the film and play it completely  straight, which gamble pays off handsomely by way of one of the most memorable scenes of the year.) Perhaps there is a better way to illustrate how moving this movie is: this was  perhaps the first film I've ever seen in which the audience, but the entire audience, sat in complete silence through the end credits. Watching Moodysson's films gives me the unmistakable feeling of reading chapters in a book by a talented and versatile author. Lilja 4-Ever is directed  with such an easy confidence that it just makes me look forward to any future  movies by this guy.",

When it comes to the story, the first half of Lilja-4-ever is quite Kaurism\u00e4ki-ish. But then something happens, and Moodysson is no longer a Kaurism\u00e4ki, but rather more a von Trier. There is more than a little Breaking the Waves about Lilja-4-ever, but it is a simpler and therefore even more touching story. Touching and powerful. Whereas other films depicting utter despair and misery may make you sad, this film makes you angry. Very, very angry.",

And there is no danger of anyone missing the message. You could argue that it is done in a quite inelegant fashion, but it is very effective and I can't stop thinking about this movie. The two main characters, Volodja and Lilja, are brilliantly played.",

            "content": "Having seen this stirring movie last night, I have now felt shell shocked for about 20 hours and still can't get that face out of my mind. I have read some of the comments, saying this movie is predictable, and I tend to agree, but I don't see this as flaw. In my experience, real life tragedy is very often painfully predictable, and thanks to Lukas Moodysson for sticking to the story rather than trying to satisfy the audience.What most people fail to realize is, that the origins of the story are painfully real. Two years ago a 16 year old Lithuanian girl committed suicide by jumping from a bridge across the motorway between Malm\u00f6 and Lund. Nobody missed her, and it took many days of intensive police work just to find out her cover identity, not to mention her real identity. Lilja is from Estonia rather than Lithuania, but the inspiration is obvious, and considering this, I think the end was given before the beginning.A story without hope? It seems to be the nature of our race, that when there is no more left to hope for in this world, we tend to look for a world beyond this. Rather than interpreting the basketball playing angels as Moodysson's vision of Heaven, it would be more appropriate and more in line with the movie's subjective point of view, which tends to be focused either on Lilja's face or what she sees, to view the ending as Lilja's hope for a life beyond this one. Just like the little girl with the matches in Andersen's fairy tale imagined Heaven as a place, where she would be greeted by her grand mother.In the end, this is not a drama. It is a reconstruction of events leading to a tragic ending in a foreign country. As such, it is and should be predictable. Lilja's fate is no accident or mishap - it's a force march towards disaster in a part of the world, where desperation at times can make people close their eyes to the dangers of manipulation. How many of us wouldn't have been willing to try everything to get away from the hopelessness of life as a teenage prostitute in Tallinn? And how many of us, wouldn't have been more than willing to trust a seemingly dependable guy like her \"boyfriend\"?In my opinion, a movie like this should be judged on its emotional impact rather than any of its other qualities. If you are gripped by it, it will stay with you for days, I think. If not, then it will almost necessarily disappoint you. Feeling an explosion of shock and outrage tearing me apart, I can only repeat the words of Rammstein: Mein Herz Brennt",

It`s the first time I`ve ever thought about the child-prostitution. I want to do something, but I don`t know what. Lilja was sent from Russia to Sweden. That doesn`t mean that Russian girls is sent to Sweden only! I`m sure they are sent to Norway as well... But I don`t know what to do. I know it`s not for real, but this movie touched the root of my heart. I wasn`t crying, just shocked. Some of you might say I`m over-reacting, but that`s not my case ;) I disagree with one of the comments here. I mean the film does make you react and think. I also think that it`s OK that the film is sad from the beginning till the end. You`re sitting there, hoping Lilja won`t die, hoping she will get away from the hell she`s living... If you didn`t care about such problems before, you`ll surely care now. Go see it!",

            "content": "Luukas Moodysson has made a movie that is not easy to watch.If You want to forget reality and troubles and escape to a fantasyland where everything can be fixed by a hero, don't go to see this movie. Or go and see it on a day You can handle bad feelings that come from seeing things the way they are in many poor kids' and girls' lives. Life with nobody who cares, no hope for the future. There are  many  abandoned kids in the areas of former Soviet Union (now Russia, Estonia etc). Kids who live on the streets after their parents have thrown them out just like Volodja in this movie. There are many girls who have been cheated to leave their country with false promises of jobs and better lives somewhere else.There are many men who seem to be good citizens, good fathers, good husbands and still they have another hidden side, when this decent man buys sex. Buys sex from someone who can be underaged and who doesn't get anything, not even any money for herself. A girl who is locked in. A girl who is afraid. a girl who has no one, no hope, no way to see any future. Why they do this? Most of us who've seen this movie have safe home, money enough for nesesseries and for some fun too, we have warm, nice place to live, we have food on the table everyday, we don't really know how it feels to have nothing. No safe , no money, no electricity, no food, no job, no possibility to wash your clothes.... Nothing to win and nothing left to loose... I think that Luukas Moodysson has succeeded in making a movie that makes You stop and think. These sad, terrible  things in the movie are really happening. What we could do? In Sweden they have made a law that makes it illegal to buy sex. I wish and hope that same kind of law will be soon here in Finland. The government is thinking about it right now. People should care for eachother, take care for eachother. And parents should care for their kids, both parents. People should stop seeking only for their own pleasure and think more the others. These things Luukas Moodysson's Lilja 4-ever made me think. This is not an easy movie. But it is very good and true. Go and see it. Stop and think.",

Still, I was unbelievably shocked and deeply affected by this film.Coincidentally, my wife comes from Estonia, where the film was shot. I had to be simply thankful that she did not experience what Lilja did. I'm glad that this film shows explicitly one of the world's ills. Awareness doesn't solve problems, but at least it's a start.

            "content": "This was not a good movie for the following reasons: 1. The dialog lacks completely of style and contents.2. Several scenes seem contrived. I get to wonder, is this how girls debut as prostitutes? Do really a boy on the street become the only friend of a teenage girl like this? Do young boys look and act like Andrei when they fool girls in this way? Does a teenage girl left by her mother really jump into the mud? Do polish pimps act exactly this way? Are not usually the stories and the moral in trafficking much more complex than this? Is really a lady of 16 in Estonia so helpless?3. I do not feel that I learned anything about reality in the movie. The political context is not treated, the psychological portraits are narrow. There would be lots of different things that could have been made interesting, like the Estonian family background, the structure in the youth culture, the techniques of illegal trafficking, and the Western consumers of these young women. As it is made in this film, it is all stereotypes that even I could have written with my scanty knowledge.4. The supernatural parts, with the wings, heaven and afterlife feel embarrassing.5. The camera work is mediocre at best.The good about watching this movie is that it makes you see what amazing works other movies like Requiem for a Dream and Christiane F are.",

            "content": "I got this film on DVD as a present from a swedish friend of mine. She asked me, if I knew what \"trafficking\" was. The first thing that came to my head was related with drugs, but then she explained me about this \"girls trafficking\", and I remembered that I've seen in a couple of films before(Danny's Pierce Girlfriend in Waking life, for example).Lilja 4-ever may be the rawest and the most tragical film that comes to my mind. Even the dogmas(that in the most are tragic), get short to this tragedy. Yes, because this films is a real tragedy; Lilja has no way out nor coming back. And if she had it, it would be anyways misery everywhere.What makes this films so shocking, is that Liljia's life goes from bad to worst. At the beginning she's a normal girl, with a family and hopes, then her mother leaves, her aunt makes her move to a horrible apartment, she's got no money and their friends threat her like a prostitute. And that's only part of the sad things that happens to her. She has no more chances, whether or die or sell the only valuable things she has left: her body and her dignity(It is very good that part, when Lilja tryes to sell some useless things that she found in the apartment. That will take her to nowhere).The climax of the film is based in new hopes created on her by a young fellow that gives her a chance to a better life. Sadly, at that part of the movie, we all know about the low level of possibilities for a happy end. These broken hopes create a second part with the enough dosage of tragedy to make any film a hard one.On the technical, a couple of shots reminded me the dogmas, with free cameras and discoordinated zoom, which supposes more reality.I also think that the music gives an important dosage of reality.It is hard for me to believe these things. I was quite shocked with the particular story, but I also was very shocked with the situation of the young fellows in that russian speaker land, where it seemed to be usual that school girls do prostitution and glue-for Christ's sake! Glue!. I mean, glue is not alcohol nor pod. They are literally burning their brain out!If you liked this film, I recommend you Last Resort(by Paul Pavlikovsky). It isn't a tragedy as this, non the less it has not a happy end, but at least a hopeful one.",
