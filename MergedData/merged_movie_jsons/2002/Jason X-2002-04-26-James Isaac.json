            "content": "SPOILER: Uber Jason in outer space I don't mind the film and it is a guilty pleasure of mine. I saw this movie in the video store 11 years ago when I was in high school I saw the VHS cover of the film and I saw it on DVD. So finally I got this film on Blu-ray disc just finish it watching it today and I must say it is not a bad film I like it a lot. Like I said it is a guilty pleasure of mine. I know a lot of people hate this film I don't. I think is MILES way better then Jason Goes to Hell and Miles way better movie then Hellraiser: Bloodline that was in outer space this movie is just better.7.years ago when I become a fan of Supernatural I heard that Jared Padalecki will be in the reboot Friday the 13th movie I rushed to see this movie. I watch Friday the 13th the original, Friday the 13th Part 2, the (2009) reboot and this film Jason X and yes I like it.I thought this movie will copy Alien and Aliens but it didn't copy any of those films it was solid and it was original it had his own story. I didn't thought this movie was bad I thought it was an interesting story that had a good action and a good slasher kills.Lexa Doig was an alright as the final girl tough it was a science fiction film it was still good and I will still watching it. Lexa Doig was in The Tracker with Casper Van Dien and I liked that action film I haven't seen in a while.Jason Voorhees returns with a new look, a new machete, and his same murderous attitude as he is awakened on a spaceship in the 25th century.Lexa Doig worked in facility Crystal Lake in which they capture Jason Voorhees but he kills everyone and escapes but Rowan Lafontaine (Lexa Doig) freeze him and her self in 2008. The year is now 2455 and a new crew members on a ship unfroze those two only too realize they unfroze Jason Voorhees unstoppable killing machine. Now a new group of soldiers tries to defeat Jason who later becomes Uber Jason.Lisa Ryder was great, sexy and really hot as Kay-Em 14 I liked her, she really kicked Jason's ass and she shot him to death ha ha.So it is scary? No. Is it a good movie? No. Is it fun? VERY.I also forgot this movie is reference to Demolition Man (1993) my all time favorite futuristic action Stallone film. In which they were mention to Lexa Doig's character that she was in Cryo it references to Cryo-prison it is similar to Demolition Man.Jason X is a 2001 American science fiction slasher film produced and directed by James Isaac. It is the tenth installment in the Friday the 13th film series and stars Kane Hodder in his fourth and final film appearance as the undead mass murderer Jason Voorhees and his futuristic counterpart, Uber Jason.This movie get's a C+ 6/10 wasn't that bad of a film but wasn't a great Jason slasher film either, but still it is my all time favorite guilty pleasure of mine.I have enjoyed this movie and I had fun watching it. Honestly I have enjoyed this movie much more then I did Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan but that is just my opinion It is my favorite guilty pleasure of mine.",

            "content": "Let's face it, if you're going to rent one of the later movies in a slasher movie series, you'd be an idiot to expect high art. The fact that this is the tenth movie in the Friday the 13th franchise, the most knuckle-draggingly, ball-scratchingly cretinous 'horror' series of all time AND it's set in space doesn't exactly suggest that this'll be an all-time classic, but it's a good fun way to kill an hour and thirty minutes nonetheless.Okay, the plot is so thin even a slight breeze would make it disintegrate and the horror element is practically non-existent but then Jason movies abandoned that long ago in favour of just providing dumb escapism with inventive and bloody death scenes, which this film certainly provides. People are sliced in half, impaled on large spikes, blown up, one poor woman even getting her head dunked in liquid nitrogen and shattered on a desk, but the characters are so one-dimensional and it's so cheesy you're more likely to laugh than scream. And I defy you to watch the scene when Jason gets transformed into 'Uber Jason' for the first time and not have a colossal grin traverse your face. There's even a later scene which pokes fun at the earlier movie's clich\u00e9s with a hilarious \"beating one camper to death with the other\" sequence.This is not The Exorcist, it's not The Omen, it's even a very long way away from the original Friday The 13th, but as director James Isaac has said, \"it's just fun.\" Get your mates round, pop open a beer, disengage brain and you've got a very entertaining ninety minutes.",

It's the 9th sequel to \"Friday the 13th\".  What were they expecting?  \"Gone With the Wind\"?  For what it is, this is very good.The plot is old, no characterizations, and the killings aren't really all that interesting (except for one at the beginning which was GREAT).  Also it has an annoying tendancy to have characters say some really stupid jokes WHILE they're dying!!!  The acting is totally horrendous--the worst I've ever seen in a \"Friday...\" film.  I realize that's saying alot but it's true!  All the cliches are squarely in place including the dialogue (\"Get your people out of there!\"  \"We're all safe here.\"  \"He's finally dead.\"). Basically this is so bad it's funny!  Also, surprisingly, it wasn't too bad. It had it's dull moments but the characters, acting and lines were so funny...So is is scary?  No.  Is it a good movie?  No.  Is it fun?  VERY.  So far the best bad/good movie of 2002.Extra bonus--Some of the WORST jokes I've ever heard in a movie.",

It actually seems like it is meant as a spoof and a farce on its own franchise. You take Jason Voorhees and put him in a cryo-freeze, then thaw him up in the distant future and put him into space...It is, of course, a matter of taste and personal preference whether or not you like the tenth movie and its deviant turn away from its usual formula. I enjoyed it, seeing it as a fun approach to the franchise.There were some interesting things throughout the movie, especially with what happens to Jason, which spurred the 'evil gets an upgrade' catchphrase of the movie.The effects were fun and good, as you have been witnessing all throughout the series of the movies. There were a good amount of killings in \"Jason X\" of course, as in all these movies. And there were some good laughs here as well.And \"Jason X\" has Kane Hodder as Jason Voorhees, which is more than enough of a reason to watch the movie. And a special appearance by none other than David Cronenberg.If you like the \"Friday the 13th\" movies and want a break away from the usual setting of the Voorhees movies then sit down and Watch \"Jason X\". It is fun for what it is.",

Some loved the innovation but some hated it to such an extent that they viewed it as the worst in the series. Yes, they even hated it more than Part 5: A New Beginning.But I loved this movie. I even went to see it a bunch of times during it's original release.Theres so much to love. The claustrophobia of the spacecraft, the tongue in cheek humour, the nerdy aspects of the film's vision (check out the eye operation on Jason and the way that injuries like severed limbs are remedied).Theres also an amazing cameo by David Cronenberg thats worth the price of admission alone.With this installment being based in space theres many nods to satify the most ardant sci-fi fanboys. Least not Lisa Ryder who was a star of Andromeda. Her android character is a great addition to the cast.Uber Jason is a sight to behold! And check out the liquid nitrogen kill. It's one of the best in the whole series.Highly recommended.",

I mean don't get me wrong it's a no cinema masterpiece, but it is entertaining and some parts especially in the fighting/action sequence but it is entertaining in some parts, specially in the fighting/action sequences. I really enjoyed the visual effects and I thought that the fighting scenes were well done. I didn't know whether the CGI digital effects would work or whether they would fall flat, but I can happily report that the CGI actually worked well, especially for 2002. Lexa Doig is good here, and I was surprisingly impressed by her performance. Now the professor in this movie was really annoying and I actually just hated him, like seriously his character was just crap. Kay Em was an awesome character and I enjoyed her presence. Well Jason Voorhees definitely put up a pretty damn good fight, and that is part of what made the movie entertaining. Yes, there were some lines of dialogue that were just pretty stupid and I wish I had not been there, lifelike don't rip my pants, I don't know if they were trying to add comedic relief, but if they were then it just didn't work. Ya know I actually thought I was going to absolutely hate this movie but I just couldn't. Parts of it were just too entertaining to hate. I also liked the intro, I loved the flaming credits rolling in, and truth be told I liked how Lexa Doig opened the movie with that beginning chase scene years in the past. 7/10 for Jason X.",

The best way to view this film is to simply not expect it to deliver anything and just sit back and enjoy it for what it is: a slasher flick!  And for being that, it is quite amusing.  The comedy in the film does succeed considerably more than other slasher flicks which try to incorporate comedy into the mix.  At least I thought so.  Really, I just enjoyed this film cuz I had nothing better to do when I watched it and was in the mood for something... well, stupid.  That's what it is, and for being stupid, it's fun.

The 10th or 11th \"Friday\" movie, and it was time for the crap to move into space. Plus, it was time for the franchise to sink to new lows, much lower even than was promised at the outset, back in the 80s.This film is TYPICAL of the 90s and 00s: the brand new level of idiocy that has engulfed Hollywood movies. So much here is cretinous that it would be pointless to list all these things. But since I happily indulge in pointless things I'll mention a few: 1) Jason V. (not X) actually stabs a women with a machete THROUGH A HALF-A-METER-THICK MILITARY METAL DOOR, 2) why does Jason V. get an automatic run-over by the medicinal worms (bugs) (whereas they seems to ignore the other piles of bodies)? 3) we are never given Jason's full bio, including his 20th-century studies of 25th-century space ships and how to move about them without getting noticed and without getting all-too confused, etc. Jason V. is one smart cookie, both omniscient and omnipotent.Then, of course, there are the obligatory really, really bad, dumb gags, people cracking wise even when being pierced, decapitated - or close to getting there. And talk about political correctness: there are almost more women aboard than men - of whom the greedy captain is white (well, of course, we can't have a greedy black captain because - as we all know - only white men can exhibit greed; Michael Moore's best-selling garbage \"Stupid White Men\" tells us all about it). Towards the end we practically only have women and black guys as survivors (even the android is a a woman). Alright, alright, we GET IT. Equality of the sexes and between races and all that\u0085 And what better place to hammer that boring old point than in a SILLY HORROR film?A movie that represents 100% the sadly retarded times we live in.

He begins hacking and slashing his way through a group of less obnoxious nitwits on board the space station in deep space.Uneven structure, the film is basically two acts: the first last about 20 minutes, and sets up Jason being frozen and thawed. Then the second act has him slaughtering a commando unit, and various other people on board this space station, for the remainder of the film's run time. Film never really climaxes, it just stops in a way which the filmmakers incorrectly think is clever and humorous.A definite improvement over the previous film, Jason goes to Hell, but there are absolutely no scares. Technically well made, this is mostly a science fiction/ comedy, as the film is set on board a space station and the majority of the dialogue is one-liners. Jason makeup has been toned down considerably: no longer is he a rotting, walking corpse; here, he appears to be just a guy in a hockey mask. But that works for this movie, for some reason. I kind of liked it that way for a change. The characters are fairly dim, as always, but not as repulsive as in a couple other installments of this series. Lexa Doig, Kane Hodder, and Peter Mensah do surprisingly well with their characters and the material, which is the biggest asset for this movie.Filmed in March and April 2000, released in Germany in July 2001, Spain in November 2001, South America in January and February 2002, Stateside and the rest of the world did get it until at least the spring of 2002, giving this film probably the oddest, longest delayed release in the series' history.",

That's one thing I have to say: Just because we have computer effects, doesn't mean we have to use them. But, so far, hoping there will be no more sequels, this was a good ending. I think.

            "content": "The sequels often fail to maintain the level of the original. Franchisees tend to go downhill, and the third or fourth part is rarely worth watching, and hardly anyone dares to go even further than that. When I decided to watch \"Friday the 13th\" I was in for a surprise. The franchise that was mediocre to begin with somehow pushed through eleven movies and it even gets better towards the end. To be understood, this is far from a good movie, but in relation to the first eight, the ninth is obvious progress, and the tenth is a masterpiece. The end of \"Jason Goes to Hell\" clearly announced the appearance of Freddy Krueger in the next sequel, but between it and \"Freddy vs. Jason\" they unexpectedly inserted space episode \"Jason X\". This film completely ignores the fact that Jason should be in Hell and begin its story totally unrelated to its predecessors. The story is placed on a spaceship and obviously inspired by the \"Alien\", and there are also elements of \"Matrix\" and Lara Croft (or maybe it is an allusion to \"Resident Evil\"). Characters are stupid as usual, and instead of sticking together to wait for Jason, they once again separate and let him kill them one by one. But, to be honest, if they were smart there would be very little material for a horror movie. The girls are again beautiful, but this time they are dressed all the time. The film maintains a very fast pace and tense atmosphere from beginning to end, and even if doesn't keep you on the edge of the chair, you certainly will not be bored. For me, this is the most suspenseful part of the franchise and I would probably slip out of the chair if there was no occasional humorous scenes and totally crazy killings, which, especially combined, for a moment create comic reliefs.Look at that. - A shooting star. :D7/10",

            "content": "Retrieving a relic of Jason Voorhees frozen in time, a group of students studying in the future find themselves stalked through their space-station home by the reawakened killer and must use the technology of the time to stop him.This was an absolutely fantastic entry which was one of the more enjoyable and exciting entries in the series. The best part of this is the extremely high-impact action scenes, which generate the best times here, starting with the opening attack on the guards in the facility in rather fun fashion before the big chase that gets him frozen with her, while the retrieval and stowing him on-board gives this one some really good times along with the initial rampage through the ship resulting in a lot of cheesy goodness to come from having these scenes set in the futuristic landscape. The initial resurrection on the heating bed alongside the oblivious worker while the screwing couple signaling the true rebirth which spawns a brilliant, original death scene with the infamous face first into ice, then shattered on a counter-top along with the two soldiers playing a virtual reality game and don't know Jason isn't part of the game, then they allow Jason to kill them quite easily. The action is non-stop, and there are many impressive scenes with this one, as the inclusion of the soldiers allows for some incredibly fun times with a spectacular stalking scene in a cargo-bay that generates some fine deaths and great suspense as Jason uses a ton of creativity to his kills which allows the great shoot-outs with the soldiers as well to generate even more good times with this one. There are more, from the battle in the engineer's room to the numerous stalking in the lab where it gets some fun action and classic stalking scenes involved in here as well as getting the action requirements out very nicely. The gunfight in the corridor getting the cyborg into the proceedings on Jason is a standout, and Jason's continual sit-ups after being hit by the shotgun really makes the scene impressive. Also, the humor is here with a bit of subtle comedy here and there and a total tongue-in-cheek attitude, not just from the jokes but the goofy tone here with the look of Jason and Uber-Jason and his dealings throughout here. As well, the shift to outer space was a refreshing change of pace and a source of much needed originality here with all these changes giving this a rather unique change in appearance that suits the film's more Sci-Fi leanings perfectly. Coupled with a Jason that is absolutely menacing and scary and looks like he's having too much fun in the role and a few nice odes to the others in the series, there's not a lot wrong here. The biggest issue here comes from the apparent lack of logic here, most of which comes from the behavior of the characters. It's really hard to believe that Jason is fooled by a holographic representation of Crystal Lake that's not even a full-on trick with the edges exposed, yet he still takes time to destroy holographs of two women who look like they belonged in the first movie and allow the good guys to escape, which is the biggest example here. The plot line involving the idiotic professor who only wants to profit from Jason and his continuous assurance that Jason will get taken care of is quite lame, as well as the finale of Jason gets ridden like a surfboard as he's falling back to Earth. However, here the action tends to hide a lot of these issues and it's really not all that noticeable when they occur. All in all, it really only comes down to personal tolerance of the cheese to find any flaws here, since it's a lot of fun regardless.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Brief Nudity, and a short sex scene.",

            "content": "First of all, I don't quite understand the 'hate' for this tenth installment of the Friday/Jason series. It's \"Friday the 13th\", for crying out loud! ANY change in the direction of the series is welcome at this point. It seems as if the fans have forgotten how 'winded' the Jason series had become - after the absolute dregs of the series in \"Jason Goes To Hell\", \"Jason Takes Manhattan\" and \"The New Breed\", the series' creators were not just beating a dead horse, they were dragging it around the track behind a tractor. \"Jason X\" at least tries to give the horse a jolt with the defibrillator. In spite of the 2nd rate effects, and general silliness, the 10th film in the series has visual energy and freshness that has been missing for at least a decade. The characters are all stereotypes, but they are GOOD stereotypes in new, snazzy 'futuristic' costumes, and they get to use snazzy new assault rifles and hologram projectors and stuff to fight back. It doesn't work of course, and Jason still kicks everybody's butt, but the change in atmosphere and sets does rescue the film from the tedious dread of previous installments. There is some actual levity and some winking tribute to some of the classic conventions of earlier films (such as when Jason beats one camper to death with another one, but it's OK because they are holograms). And Jason gets a 'new look' in the middle of the film. It doesn't really add that much to the character, but again, at least it is different enough to help you 'see' the character again after decades of over-familiarity. I rented this DVD fully expecting it to suck, but to my surprise, the opening scenes and the way the premise was set up caught my bemused interest, and the SFX of the future were JUST good enough to entertain my eyes. And eventually I ended up enjoying the proceedings quite a bit. Not nearly as much as a 'real' movie, of course, but much more than I ever expected from \"Friday the 13th\" ever again. I'd say it is the only really watchable entry in the series in several years, and if there are no more after this (and I hope not), \"Jason X\" is not a bad way for FXIII to end.",

Although they initially intended on using this information to facilitate their research on cryogenics they are soon interrupted by a man named \"Dr. Wimmer\" (David Cronenberg) who arrives with an Army escort to take physical possession of Jason's body in order to conduct his own scientific experiments for military purposes. What nobody counts on, however, is Jason returning back to life during this process and subsequently killing almost everyone within the facility. It's at this time that the last remaining survivor by the name of \"Rowan\" (Lexa Doig) manages to trick him into entering a cryogenic chamber and freezes him in the process. Unfortunately, she is injured while doing so and inadvertently becomes frozen herself. The scene then shifts to 450 years later with some explorers finding these two bodies and taking them aboard their spacecraft for further study-and that's when the nightmare begins again. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a different type of \"Friday the 13th\" which had all kinds of possibilities. Unfortunately, although it started off reasonably well, I didn't care for the manner in which the horror was lessened in order to accommodate the science-fiction aspects of the film along with the action sequences taking priority over the suspense. I especially didn't care for the scenes involving the android named \"Kay-Em 14\" (Lisa Ryder) which seemed much too juvenile and ridiculous. Again, this film had potential but the director (James Issac) was obviously not up to the task and I have rated this picture accordingly.",

Jason could wind up in the court of the Sun King ,in the middle of a Rasputin orgy,or aboard Colombus's ship heading for the new world.",

            "content": "The first film came out in 1980 and here I am in 2003 watching the newest Jason film! And to top it off, the next one has been made and it has Freddy in it! About the only positive thing that I can say about this series is that it stopped taking itself seriously a long time ago. This film starts out with Jason hanging in chains and of course he busts out. A female scientist named Rowan (Lexia Doig) locks Jason in a cryogenic chamber and freezes him. But they're is a leak and she gets frozen as well. Now zoom up 400 years and some crew on a space ship find them and take them on board. Let the thawing begin! Most of the actors in this film look no older than 25. And most of them look like models. At one point in the film a very hot female is suppose to be a scientist examining Jasons tissue and she wears a belly shirt. In fact, most of the hot chicks on board wear belly shirts. All the characters in this film act just as dumb and irrational as the characters in the original 1980 film. So much for progress! One of the more appealing characters is a female robot (Hot looking of course) named Kay-EM14 (Lisa Ryder) and she gets horny like everyone else but Ryder seems to be having fun playing it. As far as sequels go you know one of the last resorts is to put the story in outer space. Remember \"Highlander II\" and the last \"Hellraiser\" film? Well, they're going to have to resurrect him somehow for his battle with Freddy. For you trivia nuts, David Cronenberg makes a cameo and Cronenberg regular Robert Silverman has one scene as well.",

The basic plot is really dumb, but works in a way to give a new touch to this 10th installment of \"Friday the 13th\" series. Because at least it is well-known that no director would take a risk of making a Jason movie again at Camp Crystal Lake, after \"Jason Goes to Hell\" literally murdered the famous slasher franchise. So we needed something new. Okay, \"JasonX\" IS something new. But it should have been way better.I think it's useless to point out keyholes in this disgusting story. But one thing must be said about the 'uber-Jason' -- it is totally crap. the old Jason with the hockey mask was way much cooler. Please, if any one of you plan another \"Friday the 13th\" movie, don't bring this uber-Jason. And cast Kane Hodder. He's the best Jason ever.",

            "content": "Spoilers herein.There has never been so much attention to genres as now. Young moviegoers are ever so much more self-aware than their predecessors and a good part of that self-awareness goes toward genre-busting. Theorists call this subversion, but I think is a result of greater attention to the manner of art than the matter. So we have slasher films about slasher films.Now we have a scifi monster film about a slasher film. The scifi effects are ultracheesy. The slasher character prances and poses, knowing he is on camera. And that is all as it is intended to be, because we are supposed to be watching a film that knows it is a film, or rather two films.What interests me here is one decision that was made: the creation of the female android Kay.  At one point many decades ago, there was a battle for our imagination between mechanistic-type robots (Robby) and humanoids (deriving from `Metropolis'). The mechanoids are completely absent from the scene now, the only remnant being weapons (usually animal-like) operated my humans or human-like aliens.It's a matter of sex. `Bladerunner' was a turning point, with the whole story turning on how deep passion can be with a created woman (and in the twist, the man as well). Well, here we have the latest, the real star of this cobbled mess of self-reference. Kay Em has sex, we are sure to be told. And as the bad guy gets more super, so does she in a carefully designed meld of spandex and leather. Her `powers' are a combination of acrobatics and big guns. Makes no sense at all except to exploit the archetype.There are other demographic and archetypical touchstones -- the gruff but endearing marine, here black; the tenacious, wirey `scientist' girl; the equivalent of sexy dental technicians, and of course the oblivious but powerful scientists. And that brings us to the one truly clever thing in this project.David Cronenberg is little watched by the public but is influential among film visionaries. He pioneered this notion of mining for archetypical pressure points and them blowing them up with visual cues. Those visual cues are often machined organic parts, often merged with bodies. His influence here is clear, especially in the uberJason. And he plays a role! As the guy who starts it all by letting him loose. The filmmakers know what they were about, and trusted at goodly part of their audience to play along.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 4: Has some interesting elements.",

When he inevitably breaks free, government researcher Rowan (Alexa Doig) lures the lumbering maniac into a cryogenic chamber where they are both frozen for 400 years, until the crew of a spacecraft visiting the now desolate planet Earth discovers their perfectly preserved bodies and thaws them out...Up to this point, mass murderer Jason Vorhees has been drowned, macheted, axed, buried, reanimated, melted, blown to pieces, and dragged to Hell. Knowing full well that any attempt at making the next chapter in the Friday the 13th franchise in any way scary or believable would be a futile exercise, the film's makers took the only route left to them: they made Jason X a gloriously silly and tongue-in-cheek popcorn flick, full of creative deaths, gung-ho action, and flashy special effects. The result is a film totally unlike any other in the series, and one that will appeal to fans who enjoy a large helping of cheese with their horror.Featuring several smokin' hot women, a sexy android, virtual reality monsters, a team of marines with big guns, nanobots that can mend almost any injury, and, ultimately, the introduction of a new improved cyborg Jason, this film is an intentionally funny piece of mindless entertainment, and I loved it.But don't go thinking that, because this one ain't taking things seriously any more, it wimps out on the gore, 'cos it doesn't: the violence is as frequent and as bloody as always, and also very imaginative, with one kill in particular ranking amongst the best of the entire series: a sexy scientist gets her face plunged into liquid nitrogen and then smashed into small pieces on a work surface, leaving a red crystalline crater in her head.After much death and mayhem, an exciting finale sees Jason go head-to-head with the android (kitted up in PVC and wielding two high-powered hand cannons), revisit a virtual Camp Crystal Lake to slaughter a couple of topless bimbos, and, after escaping an explosion in space, burn up as he enters the atmosphere of Earth 2.",

Neither will you get awesome special effects and CGI, which this doesn't.However, if you love an insane story-line and lots of gore and murder and menace then this one delivers, and it delivers well. Kane Hodder as Jason definitely delivers the hulking figure and menace that Voorhees has and he does it so well. It's an action-packed hour and a half and not to be taken too seriously.

            "content": "'Friday the 13th' may have been panned by critics when first released but since then it is one of the most famous and influential horror films, the franchise containing one of horror's most iconic villains. The film is popular enough to become a franchise and spawn several sequels of varying quality and generally inferior to the one that started it all off. Due to the location and incorporating space and sci-fi, on top of all the expected 'Friday the 13th' elements then some, 'Jason X' is certainly different and a little credit is due for that. For a 'Friday the 13th' film it and 'Jason Takes Manhattan' are pretty unique as far as the series goes. 'Jason X' is an example of different not really being a good thing. Interesting idea and understand totally what the film was trying to do, but it was messily executed. The strengths and faults are pretty much the same as with the previous entry 'Jason Goes to Hell', excepting 'Jason X' is marginally better because it tried to be different.A couple of creative and disturbing deaths and some inventive and stylish camera work lift 'Jason X' to a better level.One good performance too, which comes from Kane Hodder. Again creeping and chilling the socks off the viewer as Jason. However, those are the only praises really that can be given. The music is a little appealing on the ears, but it still doesn't have the eeriness and mystery that the pre-'Jason Goes to Hell' films had so brilliantly and doesn't fit as adeptly. That is the least bad though of the drawbacks, which are pretty much the same as those of the worst 'Friday the 13th' films but even worse than before. Again, like 'Jason Goes to Hell', while a good deal of 'Friday the 13th' films are silly, the silliness here is overkill that it becomes insultingly ridiculous. 'Jason X' is one of the most unique conceptually of the series, but it sure is one of the strangest to the point of overdone weirdness.'Jason X' tonally feels muddled and like it was trying to do too much with too many elements screaming of kitchen-sink. If it tried to do less it would perhaps have been a better film. Hodder aside, the acting is really horrendously amateur hour, even for the 'Friday the 13th' films where acting rarely was a strength. Likewise with the dialogue, which is even worse than 'Jason Goes to Hell', with 'Friday the 13th' at its most taking-simplicity-to-extremes, stilted, cheesiest and lacking in taste. Scariness and suspense is nil, instead going for witless comedy and gratuitous gore and nudity. The deaths go for quantity rather than quality, and generally are not particularly imaginative or creepy. The story is paper thin and confused, with too hectically paced storytelling and there is the sense that the series has gotten really stale even with a change in location.Overall, lame. 3/10 Bethany Cox",

The first three installments were good, but after that, the series just got old. However, since this is the first Friday THE 13TH movie in nine years, I decided to see it anyway. I didn't have any high expectations for a movie like this. The acting was pretty good for a horror film, the special effects were quite decent, there were plenty of laughably bad but fun scenes, and although the movie doesn't do its job of providing any truly horrifying moments, it does provide some tension. It's a well done horror-comedy picture. It was a good way to kill 90 minutes. A highly entertaining slasher flick. 8/10",

You can heal a 400 year old fossil but not someone who died just now? May be the movie explains it, and I might have snoozed at the very moment. But who cares? This movie is already nonsensical. There are some stupid references of the movie being in 2455 or whatever, and has some high tech weapons made of plastic to take out Jason. And, all the other negatives are exactly those of Part 8, in fact this is part 8, but in space - no good characters, no storyline, no logic, takes itself too seriously and absolutely sucks. This feels like a crossover between Power Rangers and the Doom Game, with Jason. It feels incredibly dragged and is also a pseudo pornography.

No explanation is offered for his abrupt return from the depths of the nether, where he was unceremoniously dumped at the end of Jason Goes to Hell, though I'm not sure that really would've made a difference. This is a willfully stupid playground for half-baked science fiction ideas, terrible wardrobe choices and budget special effects; a cut-rate production that would feel right at home on the Sci-Fi Channel at 3am. Predictable to the end, it touches all the bases with gratuitous nudity, shallow characters, mysterious returns from certain doom and a truckload of dismemberments / decapitations / deaths. The only thing we're missing is the trademarked screeching cat fake-out, presumably because no self-respecting animal would be seen in such a production.

Thankfully you don't really need to have seen previous instalments to understand what is going on. We are told several times that the hockey mask wearing Jason Vorhees is an unstoppable killer then we see him killing lots of people who's efforts to kill him barely slow him down.I don't know if it was deliberate but this film seemed to have elements of lots of other science fiction films including: Alien (unstoppable killer in space), Demolition Man (Killer and person who knows what he is cryogenically frozen) and Aliens (gung-ho space soldiers killed easily and somebody trying to keep the danger alive for money). While this might make the film derivative it didn't spoil the entertainment for me.The film opens with Jason chained up in preparation for cryogenic imprisonment at a facility run by Rowan, a scientist played by Lexa Doig. Soon the military turn up to take Jason away for research but before one can say \"psycho killer\" Jason is out of his chains and they are dead. Rowan lures him to the cryogenic chamber and captures him, unfortunately for her he breaches the container and she is also frozen. Four hundred years later the Earth is uninhabitable and the facility is being examined by archaeologists who find Rowan and Jason and take them back to their spaceship. Once there they thaw Rowan and assure her that Jason is dead. Of course he is soon on his feet killing scantily clad students and soldiers in a variety of imaginative ways.While nobody was about to win any acting Oscars for this I thought Lexa Doig did a good enough job as Rowan, Lisa Ryder was OK as android Kay-Em 14 and Peter Mensah put in a decent performance as Sgt. Brodski, the rest of the cast were fairly forgettable, they were just there to look pretty and die. The special effects were pretty good for the most part, certainly better than I'd expected from part ten of a slasher franchise.Several people have said this will only appeal to fans of the series, I have to disagree with this as I thought it was fun... perhaps it only appeals to fans of the series or fans of second rate science fiction.",

            "content": "Up until now my absolute favorite Jason Voorhees killing sequence featured in \"Part 6: Jason Lives\" (or was it part 7?), namely when everyone's beloved hockey-mask wearing mass murderer ties up a sleeping bag with a teenager inside of it and just powerfully smashes it against a tree. That death sequence was awesome because it was just so cruel and relentless, but this tenth and long-awaited (at least by some) installment features one that easily surpasses the tree-smashing and it actually might be \u0096 hands down \u0096 the number one coolest killing scene of ALL the \"Friday the 13th\" movies. Still fairly early in the film, Jason baptizes a blond girl's face in a cryogenic bath and subsequently smashes her frozen head to pulp against the dresser. Vintage Vorhees move, if you ask me! And even if it wouldn't be for Jason's best kill ever, \"Jason X\" is a tremendously entertaining slasher flick and surely one of the better efforts in the franchise. It looks as if director James Isaac and writer Todd Farmer abandoned all hope to come up with a halfway decent script for this horror series and just simply focused on grotesque gore situations (with marvelous special effects) and a throwback to all the good old clich\u00e9s and stereotypes of the genre. I must say I like this approach. Why change a winning team, right? The narrative structure is incoherent and illogical as hell, but the film cheerfully moves from one nasty & imaginative butchering sequence to another. The film opens in the not too distant future, where the authorities finally captured Jason but they're unable to execute him due to his unnatural ability to repair his own damaged tissue. An obnoxious scientist (played by no one less than David Cronenberg in a sublime cameo) wants to do further research but inevitably Jason escapes. One doctor manages to lock him up in the cryogenic freezer before dying herself as a result of a machete stab wound. Then, just like that, the year is a 2455 and a class of space teenagers and their teacher stumble upon the frozen bodies. They reanimate the doctor with futuristic techniques (it has to do with ants!), but obviously ol' Jason doesn't need any help coming back to life. He awakes and promptly does what he does best without wondering for one second what year it is or why he's on board of a spaceship. \"Jason X\" is a truly amusing and worthy addition to the legendary horror series. The horny & brainless teenagers at Camp Crystal Lake have been replaced with horny & brainless teenagers in space, the variety of murders is splendid and it has to be said the film contains some downright ingenious little ideas! For example, Jason comically interrupting two geeky students' interactive video game, a recreation of Crystal Lake and \u0096 of course \u0096 Jason's already notorious transformation into Uber-Space-Jason, with enclosed mask! The special & make-up effects are unquestionably the film biggest trump, and it shouldn't come as a big surprise that director James Isaac's previous work always involved the engineering of special effects. He actually did a lot of work for David Cronenberg (\"The Fly\", \"Naked Lunch\", \"eXistenZ\"\u0085), which immediately explains how he could convince the acclaimed director to appear in a mainly insignificant ninth sequel of a teen-slasher.",

            "content": "Jason X, the 10th installment of the Friday the 13th series, leaves the serene and eerie woodland backdrop behind and seeks out a new frontier... You guessed it: Space! (the final frontier). While at times you might not be able to shake the feeling that you are watching an even worse rip-off of 'Hellraiser: Bloodline\", don't let that deter you from watching this little gem of a film. If you love gore and campy humor, Jason X delivers in spades. In fact, and perhaps not surprisingly (if you've seen the cover art and/or read the synopsis), this is quite possibly the silliest, campiest, most ridiculously implausible Friday the 13th in the series--and that's what makes it so great! Think 'Friday the 13th part IV' meets 'Lost in Space' meets the gag reel from 'Alien: Resurrection'--What could possibly go wrong?!Here are some highlights (mild spoiler alert): Jason is captured and brought to a crystal lake research facility where, thwarted in their many attempts to kill him, the scientists resolve to study his regenerative properties for the good of mankind (and some fat $$$, presumably). Following a struggle at the lab leading to a rupture in a cryogenic pod, Jason and a scientist both wind up frozen, and despite his otherwise steel imperviousness, Jason is somehow rendered inert. Fast forward 445 years and (all while the bogey man was sawing logs, mind you) humans have polluted the earth to the point of complete uninhabitability and have moved to a new planet: Earth 2. Ah hahahaha--ahem--excuse me... Some students on a trip to earth (and yes, crystal lake is a hot spot for post apocalypse Earth 1 vacationers) find the frozen bodies and bring them back to their spaceship where calamity (and hilarity) ensues. You might think that by the 10th Friday the 13th film they would be running out of inventive ways to kill people, but in this you would be mistaken (thanks, especially, to the new 'outer space' setting). As expected, Jason comes out of his 445 year nap swinging, slamming VR space campers against a tree while they're zipped up in a sleeping bag, and shattering another young lady's face against a table after shoving it into liquid nitrogen, just to mention a couple. All in all, it's a fast-paced, raucous good time, and the twists and turns are innumerable, as Jason is presumed dead no less than 3 times throughout the film, eventually falling victim to an explosion only to be resurrected as 'UBER-JASON'... Delightfully ridiculous!... Such a 'film' obviously deserves better than a 4.4. I'll give it a solid 5.5",

            "content": "Location: Crystal Lake Research Facility. Subject: Jason Voorhees. Status:Awaiting Cryogenic Suspension. Indestructible mass murderer Jason Voorhees (Kane Hodder), who is thought to be responsible for over 200 murders, has been captured and is being held prisoner. Dr. Rowan (Lexa Doig) is planning to freeze Jason as all attempts to execute him have failed. Dr. Wimmer (director David Cronenberg) however has other ideas and insists that because Jason can regenerate any damaged tissue he is far to valuable to freeze. Before long Wimmer and his soldiers are all dead and Jason is again on the loose. Rowan manages to trap Jason into the freezing pod and start the process. Jason sticks his machete through the pods door, stabbing Rowan and causing a breach, they are both cryogenically frozen. The film then fast forwards over 400 years into the future to 2455. The Earth can no longer sustain life and is just a barren lifeless wasteland, a bit like some of the UK is now really. Humans now live on Earth 2. Professor Lowe (Jonathan Potts) and four of his students, Janessa (Melyssa Ade), Stoney (Yani Gellman), Kinsa (Melody Johnson) plus Azrel (Dov Tiefenbach) and a babe of a android called Kay-Em 14 (Lisa Ryder) find both Rowan and Jason while on Earth 1 for some reason I can't think of right now, and take them back to their spaceship called the 'Grendel'. They revive Rowan and introduce her to everyone including the other characters we haven't seen yet who are Waylaner (Derwin Jordan) and Kay-Em's programmer Tsunaron (Chuck Campbell). They take Jason to a laboratory so a blonde babe of a student (why were none of my fellow class-mates as beautiful looking as her?) named Adrienne (Kristi Angus, if you ever need a date Kristi drop me an E-mail!) can conduct some experiments on him, and his eyeball. Soon enough Jason is up and walking around and kills Adrienne, shame that I thought she was a real babe and very easy on the eyes! Jason then kills Stoney and sets his sights on everyone else on board! Luckily it just so happens that besides a bunch of students there are also a platoon of heavily armed soldiers on board! But can even Sargeant Brodski (Peter Mensah) and his team of 'grunts', Kicker (Barna Moricz), Briggs (Dylan Bierk), Dallas (a cameo by screenwriter Todd Farmer), Condor (Steve Lucescu), Sven (Thomas Seniuk) and Geko (Amanda Brugel) stop the seemingly invincible Jason? Directed Jim Isaac I had a blast watching this. There are lots of sequences that I had fun with. The script by Todd Farmer never seems to take itself too seriously and moves along like a rocket. The space setting is different for the Friday the 13th films and overall I really liked it. The interior of the spaceship looked suitably futuristic with plenty of computers and bright neon lighting, the props were cool as well with some great over-the-top looking guns and I especially liked Jason's new shiny chrome ultra sleek medical machete. There are some cool kills as well, someone is impaled on a large drill and spins round as they reach the bottom, the total babe Adrienne who I wanted to survive or at least make it further into the film has her face frozen and then smashed to pieces and in a yucky scene she also cuts Jason's hockey mask off his face with a scalpel which reveals Jason's rotting face beneath, there are slit throats, people cut in half, decapitations, mangled bodies and someone has their arm cut off with a machete. This Friday the 13th delivers more gore than most of the previous instalments. I loved the scene where Lisa Ryder dresses up in skin tight PVC, arms herself with some serious firepower and battles it out with Jason, a scene that looks like it could have come straight out of the Matrix (1999), but it's more fun here. The special effects are good, the CGI isn't always brilliant but it more than satisfactory for a relatively low budget film. The acting is OK, at least everyone manages to keep a straight face, and did I mention that Adrienne is a seriously hot looking young lady? David Cronenberg's cameo at the beginning is also rather cool. On the down side it becomes a little too silly for the last 20 or so minutes. I mean Jason flying through space and talking decapitated robotic heads? Overall I think this is a highly entertaining film that I had an absolute blast watching. As long as you don't take it too seriously this is a lot of fun. I'm a huge fan of Friday the 13th (1980) and it's numerous sequels and this is a good one. Highly entertaining, and definitely recommended if your in the right mood.",

Yeah, like it must have taken the film-makers years to come up with that offshoot of the classic Friday 13th mythology.Do you really need to know how a psychotic undead serial killer gets up into space? You probably don't. He just does. It's not important. What is important is what he gets up to \u2013 which is killing people (like he hasn't done that before, huh?). Only this time it just seems like a lot more fun.It's as if the film-makers knew they were really stretching believability with this offering and decided to just have fun. The end result is a big, loud, kind of silly space-age romp. Think 'Alien,' but with dafter teenagers instead of Ripley, Kane and co (and an alien wearing a hockey mask).If you like serious films, or straight unflinching horror then you'll probably HATE this.

The FX are okay and the characters are mostly unlikable and annoying aside from the retro leading lady and Kane Hodder of course. It's not a terrible movie I especially enjoyed the 80s sleeping bag scene but I do feel like it's the weakest of the series. The uber Jason design is cool but unnecessary and the fact that they're aware their making a bad movie is i believe its biggest problem.

That's probably true, but there are fun moments to be had here in there over the course of the series's run. Parts 1-3 make a good little trilogy. With Parts 6, 8, and 9 all having their moments.Frankly, I was looking forward to seeing Jason X since it was the first of the series since the Scream movies made all things with slashers ironic. This could have been a good chance to make a straightforward, bloody, trashy film; A kind of celebration for a franchise that has lasted ten chapters.Instead, the movie just kind of limps along with not much to do. I will be probably the only person the world who won't fault the movie for it's admittidly stupid space concept (Anyone remember Hellraiser: Bloodline? Well, I liked that one). And I even thought the way they managed to get Jason into the future was ok. But once he got up and started walking around, the movie just didn't go for me. I think it had something to do with the AWFUL set designs which reminded me of the MST3K classic \"Space Mutiny,\" where the railing and walkway filled sets made it impossible to tell where any character was in relationship to any of the others. Here, endless time is spend while victims stumbled around in search of things to point their guns or breasts at. And that throwaway joke at the end about the holographic campers made me chuckle at the time, but now seems kind of like a cheap shot.What did I like? Kane Hodder is menacing as Jason; The part where the girl gets her face shattered is a corker; The \"screwed\" moment is OK; The \"enhanced\" Jason was a nice try; And I liked the gun-toting android woman (She's the only actress here who seems to get the point).But the rest of Jason X is just thrown together slop that doesn't do enough to suck up to people like me, who have stood up for this series in it's lamest moments.",

These teens, along with an older teacher, explain that Earth has been destroyed and tell Rowan that they are currently dissecting Jason etc. Rowan knows of Jason's murderous ways and tells them that they don't know what they're doing etc. but in the usual clich\u00e9d way they think they know what they're doing, until it's too late, and Jason is dismembering limbs here, there and everywhere.

There is no mention of any of the usual roots of the Friday the 13th movie; there is no Camp Crystal Lake and no camp counsellors, so why does Jason feel the need to kill everyone off aboard the ship, if they have done nothing in the first place. Well, the reason seems to be that Jason gets agitated by sexual activities, and skimpy-clothed big breasted woman, so he stalks around the ship killing off everyone in rage. Boring. The gore is completely unsatisfactory, save for an interesting scene where Adrienne has her face cryogenicly frozen in a sink, and smashed to pieces on the table, leaving her with no face. The script is completely wrong, and the acting is just plain unconvincing. The one one redeeming feature is the rather stylish sets, which look super cool and sexy. If they want to do Friday the 13th, I suggest they keep them on ground and in the woods, because Jason X is one terrible mistake.",

That's not to say that it was particularly good when it first released, because it wasn't, but it's not nearly as entertaining as it was nearly twentybyears ago. That being said, I've probably seen this Friday film more than any other in the series, and I still feel an attachment to it. The producers, writers, etc actually had the unmitigated gall to put Jason in space, and whilst it doesn't add to the terror that the series is known for, it does provide some interesting and entertaining scenarios. There are some brutal kills that take advantage of the futuristic scenario, and some interesting callbacks to Jason films of all. This film isn't fooling anyone. Nobody would walk away from it feeling that it is a \"classic\" or good, but as I've said already, it's very entertaining.",

Good old Jason Voorhees gets cryogenically frozen and is thawed up several hundred years into the future, and guess what... NOTHING has changed at all. There are still tons of beautiful model-like teenagers showing their belly-buttons and having casual sex, and they all still get slaughtered by the monster in the hockeymask. This time around, however, he gets and upgrade in the last 15-20 minutes of the film, and is turned into some kind of hybrid man/monster/machine killing apparatus.The dialogue is below even the worst standards, the plot far from new, the acting is just above kindergarten ability... frankly, I don't know why any studio would jump onto a script like this.For God's sake, I know it's just another teen slasher movie based on an ancient franchise, but for crying out loud: Who ever said that innovative writing is forbidden in films like this one?

I regard 'Jason X' much the same way I do 'Godzilla: Final Wars' or 'Escape from L.A.'-the writers clearly wink or nod at the audience as though to say, \"Yep. This is what we're doing.\" If that's not the sort of film for you, I understand, but you're missing out on a fun, wild ride as everything possible is thrown in just for kicks.Everything is very deliberately over the top: effects, sets, costumes, make-up, to say nothing of the plot. Dialogue is at turns boneheaded and drily witty, complementing deaths that are alternately brutal and cartoonish (or why not both?). The actors here are all having a great time, putting in the most convincing performances they can in a film that does not require it. It's hard not to imagine that every day on set was more fun than work.While the whole affair is played very seriously, there's no fright to be had here, only thrills and laughs. I can appreciate that such a sudden turn for a reputed slasher franchise may be off-putting. Yet it's not terribly often that a horror film (albeit a horror-comedy) can upend expectations like this, and moreover, 'Jason X' crafts a uniquely different film that manages to arguably be more true to itself than its predecessors could muster.It's hard to miss the generally poor reception for this movie. Usually I'd remark that would-be viewers clearly weren't in the target audience, but that's not true: it's more that the target audience didn't know they were targets of a joke.Drop your expectations for what you think 'Friday the 13th' should be. Sit back, relax, and enjoy what is one of the most fun movies I think I've ever seen.",

I believe that the premise of the Friday the 13th films, set at Crystal Lake, is what makes the Friday the 13th films so cool.The cast are, like many other Friday films, all Jason-fodder, and while there are a varying degree of personalities, most get so little screen time they are utterly forgettable, with the notable exception of Lexa Doig, who gives a terrific performance.Overall, this movie is worth a watch, but unlike other Friday the 13th films, it's one that you may only want to watch once.",

It seems like the most logical step after not being able to create a good film since the first one.\nIn the year 2010, Jason Voorhees (Kane Hodder) is captured by the United States government and held at the Crystal Lake Research Facility. Government scientist Rowan LaFontaine (Lexa Doig) decides to place Jason in frozen stasis after several failed attempts to kill him. A breach is made, and Rowan is frozen alongside Jason for 455 years. Now aboard a ship in the far future they are both regenerated, and Jason continues his killing.\nThis is the tenth film in this series, and it's the 21 Century. Why can we still not get good actors? That's not to say the acting was bad, it was like it is in all of these movies, cheesy but suitable for what the actors are trying to accomplish. It's sad to see Kane Hodder leave after his fourth and final appearance in this film, he is my favorite Jason by far, really bringing this character to new levels.\nI know that this isn't the best movie, and it does have a lot wrong with it realism wise and with continuity. God is it entertaining though! There's so much to love. The claustrophobia of the spacecraft, the tongue in cheek humour, the nerdy aspects of the film's vision. If nothing else, you need to appreciate the boldness in Jim Isaac to do a movie like this.\nOverall, this may just be a guilty pleasure of mine, I know critics hated this one even more than 'Friday the 13th: A New Beginning' which I do not understand at all. If nothing else, this movie is so entertaining and true to the character of Jason you can forgive all the cheesy humor and unnecessary scenes that should have been cut. Watch this movie and have fun, that's what it's for.\n3.5/5",

            "content": "Every successful franchise, especially the 80s horror ones, has its movie that symbolizes the rock bottom. Nightmare Hour 6: Freddy's Death (1991) was from the Freddy Krueger series Halloween 6: The Last Revenge (1995) was from Michael Myers and well... Jason X (2001) was from the Friday franchise -Fair 13. Once the most prolific of the genre, the series started in 1980 reached its tenth film already tired and lazy. The penultimate film had been a bombshell and New Line's official plans were to produce the long-awaited Freddy vs Jason (2003) clash. However, the crossover was a long and time-consuming process.That's when Sean S. Cunningam, the franchise's producer and director of the first movie, said they needed a new movie to keep the character in people's mouths, but no one had an idea for the tenth of Friday the 13th. Not until Todd Farmer arrives, giving the idea of taking the Hockey Mask Killer into space. He forgets Jason is in hell alongside Freddy Krueger. In this space incursion by the antagonist who murdered more than a hundred people in Crystal Lake (and in New York as well), there is no direct connection with Jason Goes To Hell - Last Friday, the previous episode of the franchise. We don't know how and why, but Jason seems to have escaped hell and bitter his last days at a Research Facility in Crystal Lake.At the site, the young man is under the supervision of Rowan (Lexa Doig), but his superiors want to move Jason away because of some financial investments. This sovereignty appears in the skin of the exceptional David Cronenberg, filmmaker responsible for classics such as A Mosca and Scanners, who here makes a point to give credibility to his film colleagues. What we expected happens: Jason manages to escape and Rowan will have to face him, until after an unsafe procedure, both end up in a cryogenic suspension compartment, becoming two frozen specimens found only in 2455, thanks to the incursion of the archaeologist Lowe (Jonathan Potts) and his troupe of students. They inhabit Earth 2, given that our planet is destroyed.Jason is taken into space along with Rowan. Both go through the resuscitation attempt. With the girl, the process is successful. Jason, as the killing machine we've known and loved since the 1980s, also resurrects, throwing the party right at the arrival ceremony, attacking researcher Adrienne (Kristi Angus), a character created in honor of the final girl of the franchise's first film. Death became one of the most talked about in the series: he first freezes the girl's face, then smashes it into several pieces, like a crystal. Insane, but no less fun.Jason Voorhees' tenth film has a certain quality to its making, almost like an old episode of Stargate or Andromeda; not by chance, the actress Lexa Doig is the protagonist. It's more of a sci-fi parody B than a horror movie itself, so much so that Jason X doesn't make much sense within the official chronology, after all, Jason should be in hell and not being used as a guinea pig for scientists in the future, so when one of the character's comments that \"a creature that can't be killed would be too valuable to dump,\" we know that Todd Farmer's text is a metalanguage about the franchise itself and its endless sequels.Jason X has everything fans of the series would want to see: violent deaths, beautiful women, tributes to the franchise's movies (including a sex scene), really strong enemies and even an updated look for the famous killer. Kane Hodder, highly inspired, brings a strong Jason, with his deep breathing and quite menacing. Here, he has hair, but not the ridiculous strands from the previous movie. He also no longer lets out the grunts that destroyed the ninth part, nor does he throw his victims everywhere. He kills without mercy, rips his head off, cuts it into pieces and even faces a virtual monster, in one of the funniest scenes in the movie.Taking advantage of the futuristic environment, Jason faces the agility of a cyborg extremely prepared for a fight with the assassin and also participates in a virtual reality, set in 1980, in Crystal Lake. With the repetition of the famous little song (reedited in the second film), Jason beats the sleeping bags with the girls against a tree, mercilessly. The scene was inspired by Friday the 13th - Part VII, where Kane Hodder ended up getting very tired of carrying the heavy bags over and over again. According to the original screenplay, the idea was to make Jason reunite with his mother in 1980 and kill her, showing his total irrationality and malice. The scene ended up not being filmed.It's fun and bizarre to see how Farmer mixes typical space exploration movie characters with the banal clich\u00e9s of the Friday 13 slasher movie. Where else would you imagine seeing horny teenage scientists on the deck of a spaceship? Or maybe that the ship's officers all wear tops? Again, it's more of a parody than a serious movie, and Farmer really pushes the envelope by exploring an android character (played by Melyssa Ade), but it's fun when the story requires a heavy fight between artificial intelligence (with machine guns and costumes from leather) and Jason. It's a guilty pleasure of the big ones.But the quotes don't stop there: one of the characters in the film is called Adrienne, in direct reference to the actress Adrienne King, who played the heroine of the first film. At a certain point, Jason finds his old machete and decides to use it again on Prof. Lowe, the movie's comic relief, as well as the cyborg herself. Jason repeats several classic deaths from the series in this film, such as the traditional slit throat and the knife thrown from a distance; Jason's mask is removed at one point, featuring a deformed Jason who closely resembles the character in the original film.It's obvious that not everything is perfect in the film (\"perfect\" in the sense of \"fun\"). The final sequence, with Jason flying and everything, is ridiculous. The quick transformation of the assassin into \"Robocop\" is blamed on the bad editing (where the machine managed to develop the new mask, no one knows); and even the script fails to say that they tried to kill him anyway and failed, without mentioning the character's supernatural characteristics. Why, sometimes, he came back by macabre luck indeed; when Jason blows the ship apart from the outside and depressurization takes place, the effect ends after a victim is sucked out. Jason keeps breaking down the doors, but no one else gets pulled...among other nonsense.As Sean S. Cunigham points out in Donald R. Beck's documentary Secrets Behind the Massacre, the magic show involving the first night of horror at Crystal Lake was replaced by the special effects and CGI of this episode, which made it easier to be conceived in aesthetic aspects. The filmmaker also claims that the production was a step forward, after all, unlike the camp, it is more difficult to imagine what will happen in a plot located in a space totally different from the traditional one. It's a movie that reminds a lot of Syfy's productions. James Isaac creates a believable and sufficiently futuristic world without ever drawing much attention to himself. Of course the CGI used in some sequences (like the bizarre ant treatment) has aged terribly, but the sets and settings work. Seeing Jason in such a different context is heartening, especially when the killer uses some improvised weapons (see head freeze) to execute his victims, and some sequences involving dark places are almost capable of reminding us of Alien - or, at worst, from Alien: Resurrection.A festival of the ridiculous that turns out to be unintentional entertainment (or not?), Jason X is a bizarre turn for the Friday the 13th series, and it explores well the mix of the slasher genre and science fiction. Open-minded and unpretentious, the viewer can find plenty to enjoy.",

            "content": "So Jason is back, and in a big way, with possibly the most expensive movie of the series so far and certainly the most special effect-filled one. Following on from JASON GOES TO HELL, which changed the core concept by having Jason becoming an evil slug that jumped from person to person, here we have the traditional hockey-masked killer back, but the setting is a futuristic spaceship in the style of many recent B-movie sequels. Thankfully, the film is still violent at heart, and for a 15 certificate film it offers some of the most imaginatively gory moments I've seen in a long time. People are decapitated, cut in half, thrown onto enormous drill-bits, get impaled, electrocuted, have their throats slit, and plenty more. Certainly the film's most notorious sequence is also the most inventive, having a young blonde lady getting her face frozen in liquid nitrogen, then smashed apart on a work surface \u2013 this is without a doubt the most disgusting thing I've seen on screen in a long, long time.The formula is predictable, involving young good-looking heroes and heroines narrowly evading Jason at every turn, but the special effects are better. Certainly the kills are authentic-looking and the CGI shots are fun if not particularly convincing. Set design is spot on, and elements of the traditional Friday the 13th music are more than welcome. Like it or not, things do become very cheesy as the film progresses, introducing the 'Uber-Jason', a nanobot-modified killer who looks more like the Terminator than Mr. Voorhees, and the climax, set in space, is totally off the wall and utterly unbelievable.The main thing, though, is that this film is fun, and a whole load of fun at that. There's plenty of self-knowing humour, black comedy and the young cast do a lively job. The film introduces a new hard-assed action hero in Tony Todd-lookalike Peter Mensah who I'd certainly like to see more of (and thankfully I did, when he took a lead role in the smash TV series SPARTACUS). And it wouldn't be the same without stuntman Kane Hodder, as huge and hulking as ever, who positively delights in a return to his famous role. So, fans of the series will delight in this entry which is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time; it never lets up from the start and offers enough blood and guts to satisfy any horror fan's appetite. An absolute delight.",

            "content": "As Alice COOPER sang it during the end credits of JASON LIVES: \"He's back, the man behind the mask\" for his best carnage since FRIDAY THE 13TH: THE NEW BLOOD that introduced the stunt man Kane HODDER as the definitive incarnation of Jason VOORHEES.For the second time, Jason returns after what was supposed to be the final chapter of the never-ending saga, and for the second time, he gets an upgrade.In JASON LIVES (the real follow up to THE FINAL CHAPTER), he became a living dead with an increased strength and an invulnerability to fire and bullets.Now, we get the Uber-Jason, a cross between the TERMINATOR and the killer of Crystal Lake.After the disappointment brought by JASON GOES TO HELL: THE FINAL FRIDAY in which the killer was represented as a parasite with the ability to possess bodies and, as a result, allowed us to see Jason in his real shape for only two minutes at the beginning and five at the end, it's good to see that the hockey mask's back during the entire movie. When you watch a FRIDAY THE 13TH film, you want to see Jason, his mask and his big knife, not a guy trying to imitate Kane HODDER. It's good to bring fresh blood to a story that reaches its ninth entry but turning Jason into the cousin of \"THE HIDDEN\" wasn't the appropriate way to do it.So here's JASON X, a film where the star is the man behind the mask. More than in any other FRIDAY movie, Jason is treated as a myth, a horror legend. Jim ISAAC has made very cool shots of him where he looks very threatening. The opening sequence, with the close-ups on Jason's eyes when he's watching the lab-assistant are superb as you feel all the inner rage of the monster. This is one of best sequences that ever appeared in a FRIDAY THE 13TH movie, really impressive.However, the film isn't very scary but I don't think it aimed at making you jump out of your seat with terror. No, JASON X is to FRIDAY THE 13TH what BRIDE OF CHUCKY was to CHILD'S PLAY: a fun,fast and wildly furious adventure built around the main character, really seen as an icon, that both respects and wants to break free of the other episodes. In a nutshell, FRIDAY THE 13TH fans might be a bit disappointed, but if their main interest wasn't gratuitous nudity and \"serious\" gore but Jason VOORHEES, then it should be a dream come true.The screenplay's very simple but shows a real sense of rythm. There's plenty of very exciting situations with lots of gore and action. Here, there's no endless chases: Jason's more brutal than ever and doesn't waste his time with his victims.But the real gift of this film is its sense of humour, very respectful toward Jason and the slasher movies in general (unlike SCREAM) that is aimed essentially at the fans of the series. Some dialogues are bound to become cult and a scene involving Uber-Jason and a virtual Crystal Lake is a pure jewel. It made me laugh so hard...There's even a little reference to John CARPENTER's DARK STAR at the end.As a conclusion, let's say that although it's not a typical FRIDAY THE 13TH movie, JASON X stands along with JASON LIVES as the best entry in the series. It's a wild ride every Jason fan should enjoy. Don't listen to bad critics, this film really rocks: JASON'S BACK!!!",

            "content": "So it's been a long time since the romp that Jason Goes To Hell was and now we have this arguable piece of clever self-spoofing hysteria nearly a decade later and I have to admit that it is not one of my personal favorites...but I am proud to say that at least the hockey-masked splatter-zombie himself gets hefty screen time this go-round.Jason X opens at the Crystal Lake Research Facility(I'm not sure what year it opens in but I'm sure it's supposed to be the future)where Jason has been contained until he can be cryogenically \"frozen in time\" by modern technology(wow, now we can freeze people and bring them back even 400 years later)!!! This project is led by Rowan, our beautiful heroine from this entry, who runs into Dr. Wimmer(Cronenburg)who has \"gone over her head\" and comes to take Jason and doesn't want him \"frozen\". What follows is predictable:Jason escapes restraint, kills all of Wimmer's men and then Wimmer himself, and proceeds to pursue the beautiful Rowan who ultimately gets him into the cryogenic unit and gets the freezing process underway. However, as if she was born yesterday, she lingers in front of the unit just so Jason can thrust his machete through the steel and into her gut causing a \"cryogenic breach\". The unit then leaks and freezes Rowan as well....wow, this is tough!!! We cut now to the year 2455 and a team of students has come to what is now Earth One to....explore, I guess, and they discover these two beings in perfect condition. They take them aboard their ship with intentions of bringing at least the female out of 'stasis. But the Professor on the ship gets greedy, realizes Jason is worth a fortune, unfreezes him, and voil\u00e0!!! We have our new Jason movie. I had to end the plot cause it would have gone forever...Now, there are several corny yet clever lines which include one about what is on Jason's face and someone replies, \"A hockey mask!\" and another girl(Janessa, who is completely ANNOYING)replies,\"What's a hockey mask?\" and the robot-chic Kay-Em 14 answers, \"Facial armor used in sport outlawed in 2024.\" It just kind of makes you wonder whether or not hockey would still be around in that time...no reason that it shouldn't, it just makes you question the future a little bit.The deaths were a disappointment this time, yet some were great like the Virtual Reality with the two guys and the one involving a large drill!! Nevertheless there are a couple of suicides and a couple of off-screen deaths which didn't do anything for me. At this point in the series that just does not meet my standards. The acting is sometimes so bad that you grimace or grind your jaw, especially from the actress playing Janessa(who also has a memorable death). The kinky thing with her and Professor Lowe was sexy, to say the least, but other than that I really couldn't wait for her to relieve us of her presence. Her line \"What? ARE YOU HIGH?!!\" was downright repulsive and awful in so many ways. Oh, the mistakes....Still I am happy with this entry over Jason Goes To Hell and HAVE watched it several times and even watched it on the big screen. It had a promising \"open door for a sequel\" ending that centered around a lake....yay, maybe we can get back to basics now. The Crystal Lake simulation used to distract Jason is something to look forward to if you haven't seen it yet...oh yeah, and I DO recommend it...you just have to suffer through some of its unnerving acting. I was sad to learn that Jason X was the only entry in this franchise to not make back its budget in ticket sales :( Oh well, I'm sure Freddy vs. Jason made up for it...5/10",

I saw this movie at least twice and what can I say? I loved it, I really enjoyed every second of it. Mr. Kane Hodder is the Ultimate Jason, and Jason X, has it portraying two versions of Jason. JX is the classic FT13 tale with the futuristic twist that introduces a lot of sci-fi extravaganza. Jason Voorhees is one of the most interesting monster of cinema, due to his origin, his killings are somehow justified (not like M. Myers or Freddy) because he died as a child when some horny teens didn't take care of him when he was in Crystal Lake Camp. Throughout the years he has become a modern myth. Some of the movies of Ft13th were great others not so great, but I think Jason X is among the best. JX shows how much cinematic language changed in this years, has an agile modern montage, the actors are well... unknown actors but they do it great, and the script has some clever and ironic lines, and finally the cinematography is stunning, JX doesn't appears to be a $20 million dollar flick it looks like a more expensive movie. If that is not enough, two celebrities of Horror met in the first scene.",

Of course, a bunch of soldiers screws the whole thing up and Jason kills everyone in his path before he stabs Rowan and freezing both of them.445 years later, Earth is ruined so everyone moves to Earth 2. So why not send some students back to the old Earth on a field trip? Why not send their professor and an android, too? While exploring the Crystal Lake facility where Jason was experimented on? And why not put the still frozen bodies of Jason and Rowan on the Grendel, their ship? Nothing bad can happen, right?Well, it turns out that Jason is dead and his body could be worth plenty. The Professor calls his money man, Dieter Perez (Robert A. Silverman, who has been in five Cronenberg* movies and the two episodes of Friday the 13th: The Series that he directed, too) and they discuss how Jason's body could be worth something to collectors. Luckily - or maybe not - they bring Rowan back to life.Of course, kids keep having sex around Jason, which brings the maniac back to life. He wipes out nearly everyone on the ship, including all of the soldiers that are on board. He even takes out an entire space station!The teens upgrade their android, KM-14, who wipes out Jason. Or so everyone thinks - a medical station brings him back as Uber Jason, filled with cybernetics so powerful that he can punch the android's head off. Not even a holographic simulation or a shuttle crash can slow him down! It takes flying him through re-entry and burning him up to take him out.That said - two teens see his mask land on Earth 2, so he could always come back. He can come back, right?This was written by Todd Farmer (Drive Angry, the remake of My Bloody Valentine) and directed by James Isaac (House 3). I have a real weakness for this film as it really goes places none of the others did. It's the Abbott and Costello school of running out of ideas and just doing something completely off the wall.*Cronenberg shows up in a cameo as Dr. Wimmer, too!",

            "content": "After the abysmal \"Jason Goes to Hell,\" anything seemed better. And why not make a movie so the amount of instalments is an even 10? Luckily, this goes back to same non-serious fun Jason films of previous instalments. And after watching the previous Jason movie, it really elevated Jason X.After being sent to hell in \"Jason Goes To Hell,\" Freddy obviously resurrects him and his body-count in growing. It is the mid 2000s and Jason has been captured and cryogenically frozen. They freeze him because they can't figure out a way to destroy him forever. Only the supernatural can do it! But Jason's brutish strength messes things up and he gets frozen with one of the researchers. Fast forward 450 years. A group of college students are travelling on a spaceship and stumble upon Jason and the girl. Both are thawed and then the movie turns into Alien with Jason as the monster. When we get to see the students and their professor, its pretty silly. Good for laughs. When Jason awakens and tries to destroy all, we actually become invested. When Jason gets upgraded into the most powerful he could ever be, it's pretty kick-ass.In the year 2455, some of the futuristic things we see is pretty cool. And a spaceship is cool to see in general. And add one of cinema's coolest monsters to wreck havoc. The way all this is added up makes the movie totally bad-ass. Sure the acting is dull and its not very smart, but the fights and Uber Jason are all so fun!I gave some earlier instalments thumbs up just because they were fun and they didn't demand to be taken seriously. Jason X is one of those.3/4",

            "content": "I loved this movie.  In my opinion, this is the best of the JASON movies. Jason in space?  What a great concept!  This movie combined two of my favorite genres, horror and science fiction.  The movie delivers on all counts.  It has a great story line, and terrific special effects.  The movie is non-stop action and the killings are very creative.  This movie is very gorey, and in fact, I would say it is the most gorey installment of the FRIDAY THE 13th movies so far.  And without a doubt, this is the funniest movie of the series.  It has some really great laughs.  The director definitely seems to have a well developed sense of humor and a true love of action, horror, and sci fi.  This movie is awesome.  I loved the part when the space ship crashes in to the space station and then the space station explodes.  Also the part when the grunt gets cut in half and the next shot you see is the poor guy dragging half his body across the floor.\nThe characters are all likable and memorable.  Not to mention, this installment of the series definitely has the HOTTEST girls.  There are not too many other movies in general to come to my mind that have women of this calibre.In particular, I have to mention Melody Johnson.  She played the character \"Kinsa.\"  I think she is absolutely gorgeous.  A modern day screamer-movie beauty.  She is incredibly sexy throughout the movie.  She kind of looks like Anna Paqin, but I think Melody is better looking.  She is just exactly my type.  I own JASON X on DVD and I put it in every once in a while just to check out Melody Johnson.  It seems unfortunate to me that Melody has not really done too many other movies.  She is so beautiful I would like to see more of her...A LOT more of her!If you are a fan of FRIDAY THE 13th, or just a sci fi or horror fan, you absolutely have to see JASON X.  The hologram sequence at the end where the \"upgraded\" Jason returns to Crystal Lake and encounters HOT co-eds is priceless.  The two girls offer Jason beer and pot, and then exclaim \"We love premarital sex.\"  Then Jason beats them to death by wrapping them up in their sleeping bags and smashing them into a tree.  Its creepy, violent, and super funny all at the same time.You really have to see this movie.  It is top notch from start to finish. Check it out and you will not be disappointed, you will be thoroughly entertained.",

And I don't want to hear \"What were you expecting, this is JASON we're talking about,\" or any crap like that. There is no excuse for something this dumb when millions of dollars are being spent.  With this movie's budget, New Line could have probably made a decent, and original, sci-fi movie.  But NO!  Some exec was like \"We can just make another Jason movie and market the hell out of it and make it look cool!  The teeny boppers will love it!\"There are so many things about this movie that don't make sense.  Fist of all, in the beginning, Jason is somehow captured.  This must have been a pretty difficult task, seeing as he's the deadliest killer the world has ever known.  So you think they'd have about a hundred guards watching him right?  No! Of course not!  That would make sense.  Instead, they have ONE guy watching him.  So of course Jason escapes and mayhem ensues. Etc, etc. Fast forward to four hundred and fifty years in the future (!) to a highly advanced society that doesn't know what a hockey mask is, but they still know what DVDs are, and everything goes downhill from there.Look, I don't expect every movie to be a magnificent work of art.  But I do expect a little effort and a story that is consistent and logical to some extent.  Jason X has absolutely nothing going in its favor.  I would sooner poke my eyes for 90 minutes than to sit through this crap again.",

Being killed by Jason makes as much sense, and carries as much emotional weight, as being run down by an avalanche.Accordingly, I can't get behind these movies at all - they simply become a cynical exercise in imaginative slaughter and guessing the order of victims, with no rhyme or reason about it.Oh well, the sci-fi setting in this one makes a change, Lexa Doig is pleasingly decorative, and the fact that the whole thing is considerably sillier than usual (which is saying something) might be considered a bonus.",

You can tell this takes place somewhere after the battle between FREDDY and JASON,because you can see claw marks on JASON's mask.Jason is frozen because they can't find a way to kill he,but before a murder spree happens JASON is frozen,then unthawed in the year 2455.That means trouble,trooouble.    I like that they did something really new to the series and made it had a space like 80's feel to the original Friday the 13th.The death scenes were great and invented to give JASON more space than that campground.And that short new look at what JASON is going to look like is brilliant.Kane Hodder is JASON and forever will be.So a great installment to the series.Really it is.",

            "content": "After multiple attempts to kill him, the decision is taken to cryogenically freeze the mass murderer Jason Voorhees to contain him for all time. However the advice of Dr Rowan is ignored and the military decide that he is too valuable for science to lose. Of course it all goes wrong and it is only the sacrifice of Rowan that gets Jason frozen again. Jump forward a few hundred years and a student expedition uncovers the frozen bodies of the Jason and Rowan. They revive Rowan but start to cut up Jason as all scans show him to be dead; of course Rowan is brought back to life too late to warn the others and before you can say \"sexy teenagers in peril\", Jason Voorhees is back to his old tricks on board the spaceship as it heads towards Earth II.Although I have yet to find any real value in the Friday 13th series, I decided that I'd give this a try since it had had many positive reviews. I quickly realised that this film was just going to push all the usual buttons but do it slightly differently by essentially crossing the series with the alien series (not really of course, but I couldn't shake the feeling that this was the closest it could have got). Looking back I can only assume the kind reviewers were a reflection that at least this film wasn't as bad as some of its predecessors rather than being reviewed by critics on its own merits. Despite being set in deep space, the film still manages to pull together a cast of nubile young actresses alongside some other genre clich\u00e9s before setting out to pick them off one at a time in a series of rather nasty but yet unimaginative set pieces. In fairness it is distracting and fans of the series will probably enjoy it but personally I just felt like I was plodding wearily through overly familiar ground and the fact that it crossed over into a different genre didn't change that.The gore is reasonably good I suppose (I'm not really a horror fan) and those who like this sort of thing will probably not be bothered by the fact that the scares are obvious and don't really have a consistent or significant tension to them. The cast are all very pretty and buy into the material pretty well. Doig makes an unconvincing scientist but is sexy and gorgeous enough to fill the main requirements of the script. Hodder does his usual slow plodding stuff without having the opportunity or ability to add to it. The rest of the cast are a collection of soldier clich\u00e9s, sexy young things, geeky guys and other genre staples. None of them do anything special or interesting but in fairness none of these films have ever been about the cast as performers \u0096 just about them as eye candy and fodder.Overall this is better than the general standard of the Friday 13th films if only by crossing over into another genre to provide the same old same old with at least a fresh appearance. It is of course nothing of the sort and just repackages the same old stuff as usual. Better than the usual slasher fare but just don't expect it to be good.",

However, from Friday the 13th Part 6: Jason Lives onwards everything starts to improve, and in my opinion it must be the only long-running movie series that actually gets better as it goes along.Jason X is my favourite film in the series: it works on all levels, as a slasher film, as a science-fiction movie, and as an action thriller. Just as the preceding entry Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday (which I also enjoyed) was a celebration of the '80s horror genre, with nods and winks to Halloween, the Nightmare on Elm Street series, The Evil Dead, The Thing, etc, so Jason X cheerfully includes elements from numerous sci-fi action movies, such as Aliens, The Terminator, Virtuosity, The Lawnmower Man, Robocop, and Predator. But it doesn't do so to rip those films off. Instead, the producers simply know that if you put Jason in a future setting, movie-savvy audiences are going to be annoyed if he doesn't encounter such sci-fi standards as androids, virtual reality, nano-technology, cyborgs, and space-marines.The producers even have the courage to play Jason for laughs towards the end of the film, as Kay-Em 14 takes him to pieces (a terrific sequence!!!), plus the hologram scene where he's confronted by two hilariously stereotypical topless cuties. But the film never tips over into farce, and successfully ensures that Jason remains as menacing and lethal as ever.Full marks also to the writers and cast, for making the various potential Jason fodder candidates amongst the most well-rounded individuals in the series. One complaint often made against Jason X is that it lacks a strong Final Girl, but I think that's merely because so many of the characters register so strongly.",

The actors are all good looking which adds to the quality of the story.Out of all the Friday the 13th movie (so far), this one is my favorite for the action and the visuals this movie has to offer.

The characters in this movie were great. I got to like some and really hate others. They were very convincing. Jason is played yet again by Kane Hodder (thankfully!). There were some very good kills, and this was a whole new setting for Jason. But it worked very well. I personally liked Uber-Jason, although many hated him. Come on people, it had to be done! Its not like a permanent new thing for him, seriously. The effects were very good for a movie such as this. There were some very interesting scenes as well. And Jason always managed to come back on top here. 8/10 for a great Jason movie.",

When a hard working female scientist (Lexa Doig) tries different ways to destroy him but he keeps coming back alive.

He comes back to life but his new environment and when technology has changed, he goes on a killing rampage but this time on a moving space ship! Directed by James Issac (The Horror Show, a.k.a.-House 3) brings an lively, sometimes funny sequel to the seemingly never-ending series to the Friday the 13th films. Director:Issac and first-time screenwriter:Todd Farmer (He also has a small role in this). The writer added some clever and exciting moments with an delightful fun in the last half hour. Although knowing that the plot is silly and wondering how did Jason come back to life after Jason Goes to Hell. Although fans would like to think of it, it happened after Freddy Vs Jason. Still, the film is surprisingly entertaining with clever visual effects (Some of the CGI effects are quite lame, which some of it is unintentionally hilarious) and Harry Manfredini's music score isn't bad, either. Jason X is actually better than some of the Friday the 13th sequels and it's also less violent or bloody than most.DVD has an great anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer with an strong-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound (Also in DTS). DVD has an fine commentary track by the director, writer and producer:Noel Cunningham. DVD has an entertaining 30 minutes documentary on the history of the Friday the 13th films. DVD also has an 17 minutes behind the scenes featurette, trailer and more. Executive Produced by Sean S. Cunningham (Who directed the original-Friday the 13th) and director:Issac. Watch for Canadian filmmaker:David Cronenberg and actor:Robert S. Silverman in cameos. True Fans of the Series will love this one. Filmed in 2000. (*** \u00bd/*****).",

            "content": "Released in 2001-2002, \"Jason X\" starts in the year 2010 where the government decides to finally stop Jason by putting him into frozen stasis. He and another person are revived in the year 2455 by a professor and his students who are on a field trip from Earth Two to Earth One. Jason is unleashed on their spaceship and havoc ensues.This entry is like 1979's \"Alien\" except with Jason as the monster and a sense of humor. You'll also notice that it's a great departure for the series putting Jason in space in the future. Most Friday fans look down on 1993's \"Jason Goes to Hell\" and \"Jason X\" because the producers tried something new. It's obvious that they felt the series had become stale and formulaic with an incredible eight-installment run from 1980-1989. I felt \"Jason Goes to Hell\" had a refreshing concept (ripped off from 1987's \"The Hidden\") and a great intro & opening act, but the tone was distasteful and the flick eventually spiraled out of control with its cartoony quasi-horror gobbledygook; still, it featured a couple of the best women in the series (Agent Marcus and Deborah), which should be commended.I heard negative comments about \"Jason X\" over the years, but the first half is sci-fi at its best with some amusing elements thrown in for good measure. It's stunning how well the filmmakers handle the sci-fi aspects of the plot and F/X. The second half, unfortunately, becomes too cartoonish as Jason systematically annihilates most of the crew, particularly when he gets his new futuristic look, basically morphing into SuperJason (rolling my eyes).As usual, this installment features an impressive assortment of women, but it's only Kinsa (Melody Johnson) that I find appealing, except for the cameo of the campfire teen #1 at the end, played by the stunning Mika Ward. They should have included her in the main cast.To be expected in light of the spaceship plot, the film was shot mostly on sets (in Toronto) with a couple of outside sequences in Ontario.The film runs 91 minutes.GRADE: B-",

            "content": "~Spoiler~ Jason X is the most unexpectedly hilarious movie ever made...and, without a doubt in my mind, the best Friday the 13th film.  That's saying a lot for a part 10.  I laughed almost nonstop and was amazed by the kills, the humor, and the humorous kills.  This time around, Mr. Voorhees is brought to outer space and is given brilliant ways to kill teens and scores of others.  I believe this has the highest body count of any 13th film.  Kane Hodder (his fourth time wearing the mask) is at his best and the death scenes are truly jaw-dropping.  People are stabbed, beheaded, broke in half, skewered, and they brought back the sleeping bag kill.  I personally can't praise Jason X enough.  It corrected the mistake of Jason Goes to Hell; it actually had Jason in the movie.  It proved many things to horror audiences.  You can take a horror franchise to outer space and make a kick-ass movie at the same time (unlike Leprechaun 4 and Hellraiser: Bloodline).  It also proved that Todd Farmer is a writer to watch for and that James Isaacs was deserving of a second chance (his first film wasn't exactly the best).  My words will fall on some deaf ears, however, because this movie seems to split fans down the middle.  Some think the movie is utterly ridiculous (which it is) and others love the tone and direction that it took.  Some people are tired of Jason and think they need to retire him.  I say as long as they keep making these films, I'll keep watching them.  Brodski rules.Note for genre buffs: David Cronenberg cameos in the beginning of the film.",

They decide to take them both onto their ship and thaw them out which, of course, leads to Jason hacking his way through most of the passengers.A lot of the CGI is spotty, the script is a mess, and most of the acting feels porn-level at best, but Jason X doesn't want to do anything but entertain and it does that well. I don't think it's possible not to enjoy a film where someone's head is frozen and then smashed onto a table into a million pieces. It's creative where it needs to be - the kill scenes.Jason X has to be about as dumb as slasher movies get (and some slasher movies can get really dumb), but damnit if it didn't win me over by the end.

The plot is as thin as rolling paper and delivers what you'd expect from a part 10 in a 22 year saga.

Hey that was my first, well complete experience of the franchise before I went on to see 'Jason X' at cinema the week after. I liked it, and borrowed the rest of the films off a friend. The series isn't a masterpiece of cinema, but they remain entertaining.I hadn't watched 'X' since I last saw it at the cinemas, and seeing it again it was just as fun as I remembered it, although the smarting puns (with those self-referential one-liners before being dispatched in a thoughtlessly tacky script) they seem to spit out got a little too much. The manner of the humour seemed to share a common style with 'Jason Lives: Friday the 13th Part VI (1986)', with quite an amusingly clever gag involving a hologram trip back to Camp Crystal lake for early 80's goodness. Anyhow Jason leaves his traditional Camp Crystal setting (even though he's 'kinda' still in the area when the film opens) to receive the space treatment (being better than other entries including 'Critters 4', 'Leprechaun 4: In Space' and 'Hellrasier: Bloodline') and a revamp look to go with it. Was that a good choice\u0085? I don't know but it still delivered on creatively vicious violence and shocks, a beautifully disposable cast and healthy body count (plenty of meat for the slaughter) despite the change of environment and mechanisms. It's the same-old, same-old, but done with enough aplomb. Director Jason Isaac gives the film a metallic gleam and provides a rapid pace never letting the clock slow up. The special effects by Stephan DuPuis are above-par and the production design is polished. Mark Manfredini gives his score an updated touch that works with the new backdrop.The acting isn't anything to write home about; however they do fill nicely to their roles. The stunning Lexa Doig makes for a reliable central performance and David Cronenberg chips in with nifty cameo in opening scenes. Kane Hodder brings the right intensity to Jason, and has truly made it his own. Peter Mensah and Melyssa Ade were fun in their parts too.",

            "content": "As weird as Jason in space may seem, his fans finally got what they asked for - something new - when, after four false starts, this movie was finally made. Four hundred and fifty five years in the future, earth is dead and the recently defrosted J-Man finds himself aboard the Grendel, a field-trip vessel carrying students from Earth 2. So, basically, Jason + teenagers = mass death. Something old and something new. Something borrowed, or nicked, are the best bits from the Alien movies. You know what's in store, long scenes of creeping around dark corridors before being carved up.What I don't get is the fact that the filmmakers knew that we didn't want Camp Crystal Lake AGAIN and so decided to take us as far away as possible from the previous nine movies. Why must they give us the ancient and decrepit stalk'n'slash scenario yet again? Fresh zazz, or zing, or fizz, or even pop could have been added. But no! It threatens to get very dull and the only thing that saves it are the gorgeous SFX, stronger production values and more determined than usual characters (slabs of meat).James Isaac has had plenty experience in the horror genre and, along with his cinematographer, has given this movie a far more sophisticated look than most other horror flicks. Lighting is provocative and the colour palette is well thought out and bright. It's a shame that nothing of real genius, or imagination, occurs within this unique environment.Plus, I'm getting real sick of Kane Hodder, as Jason. At first, I liked him - F13, Part VII, was his premier outing - but now he's changed the character too much. Instead of an evil, worm-infested zombie, with incredible strength, he's a massive brick shithouse, who moves slower than your average glacier. How can these kids not escape him? The acting, by a bunch of Canadian TV folk, is tolerable. None has enough skill to bring any real humour, or depth, to roles. Who cares when they die? The only interesting character is a female robot, or Fembot, as the Austin Powers movies put it, with no feelings - how ironic! There's no good excuse for Jason X being so average. Even the presence of Uber-Jason - Robocop, only not friendly - is too little too late, although he, along with Janessa's cleavage, doesn't get enough screen time.If you're having a beer blast, or a stein-hoist, then Jason X is worth the rental.

            "content": "\"Jason X\" is the tenth installment in the \"Friday the 13th\" series. This time, it's 25th century and earth is no longer an inhabitable place for the human race. So, a group of people on a spaceship receive two cryogenically frozen bodies. After unthawing the frozen beings, one of them turns out to be the legendary killer Jason Voorhees. And of course, unfreezing him has brought old Jason back to life. After killing off a whole investigation crew, Jason begins a rampage among the giant spacecraft, killing off anyone and everyone who even comes close to crossing his deadly path.While this movie is fairly enjoyable, the entire idea of \"Jason in space\" doesn't sit well with me. Why bring one of cinema's most legendary murderers into outer space, the idea is a bit ridiculous if you ask me. Despite this major flaw, \"Jason X\" is a pretty fun little horror movie. The story - while it is just a little unbelievable - works on most levels. The whole space-age atmosphere to the film was interesting, so any sci-fi fans can relate a little (unfortuantely I'm not one of them). The cast was mostly a bunch of no-name actors, but they all give fairly good performances, keeping in mind this is a Friday the 13th sequel (and the tenth one, might I add). There was one really well-thought up killing in the film that I thought was extremely unique and clever. I won't say anything to give it away, but I'm sure that you'll know what it is when you see it, I thought it was pretty cool.Overall, \"Jason X\" is a campy horror movie. While the special effects and acting are decent, the whole premise of the movie is pretty silly. If you don't take the film too seriously, you may find it to be enjoyable. This is perfect for any \"Friday the 13th\" fan who may also be fond of the sci-fi genre, but for all others it may be kind of dumb. Nonethless, it's brainless fun. 5/10.",

I can't write this review without mentioning the most unintentionally funny death scene in the entire series (even if it was all happening in Jason's head) i.e. his beating to death a girl in a sleeping bag with her own companion enclosed in a similar bag!! Incredibly enough, New Line took the Cronenbergian admiration shown in their previous entry to the next level here by managing to convince the maverick Canadian film-maker himself to make a very early appearance in the film as an authority figure of some sort intent on studying the remains of Jason which have been conveniently preserved in a freezing compartment of a hi-tech lab (or something); mercifully, we are spared the vision of his unsurprising comeuppance at the hands of the revived Jason which happens soon after...",

The special effects are surprisingly fine, the actors are okay and there are indeed some (intentionally) funny moments (like: \"This oughta do\"). Of course, \"Jason X\" is far away from being a good movie but for horror-fans like me there's nothing to complain about. There's little logic and lots of gore and at least one really inventive way of killing a girl (the frozen face sequence). So, everybody who loves these never-ending horror-series \u00e0 la Nightmare on Elm Street/Halloween: watch this. It's a good sequel for a change!",

Because this is set in the future, technology has become more advanced making for some creative and gruesome death scenes which is more than satisfying. There is also a lot of (intentional) humour here with the characters saying the most idiotic things, for example the characters are in a room with Jason outside Rowan: \"i think he's still out there!\" Ganessa: \"Why don't you stick your head out and have a peek?\" This is easily the best film in the Jason franchise (with the exception of Freddy Vs Jason) and everyone should see it...already seen it? see it again!!",

Jason is put into deep freeze sometime in the 21st Century, but gets thawed out as a scientific curiosity during a student field trip aboard a spacecraft in the far off future. Kane Hodder returns for his fourth and final go-round as Jason and is his usual dependable self. The idea of featuring \"Jase In Space\" sounds absurd at first, but it works within the movie because despite his surroundings, Jason himself still remains rooted in his mindless and indiscriminating killing persona; this time he just happens to be a victim trapped in a world beyond his understanding or control. However, what really weakens this one substantially for me is that there are too many dumb jokes, and these teenagers who are supposed to be from the year 2455 still look, act, and spout dopey colloquialisms exactly like today's dopey teenagers. The writing and dialogue in particular could have been much better. A few highlights include the \"liquid nitrogen face death\" (one of the top kills in Jason history) and the humorous \"virtual reality sequences\". At least the ending devised an interesting way to eliminate Jason once and for all. ** out of ****",

If you liked the previous nine you will like this one, if the hockey masked machete wielding Jason Voorhees isnt your cup of tea then you should probably avoid the latest installment in the franchise. In this film, Jason (once more played by stuntman Kane Hodder) is placed in suspended animation and winds up getting thawed out on a spaceship some 400 or so years later to wreck havoc on a hapless group of hollywood newbies who decided to audition for this film. Actualy the cast is pretty good as this sort of thing goes and the producers decided to have some fun with the concept, throwing in everything from an obvious \"Alien\" inspired storyline to a \"Terminatrix\" babe (played by Lisa Ryder, who like co-star Lexa Doig hails from the \"Andromida\" TV Series). Some funny bits with Jason and a pointed parody of the original film due to a virtual reality simulation (!) make this one a step above most of the efforts in this series. So, until Jason rises again, this one is a keeper for fans of slasher movies worldwide. GRADE: B+",

Once the creators start having a little fun with the s.f. elements, and the KM unit gets upgraded into your typical \"leather clad dominatrix/fighter\" persona from most video games,  things start to kick in a bit. Not surprisingly, Lisa Ryder as KM is about the only person who seems to be having any fun with her part.  The virtual Crystal Lake is also a good idea, although tossed away way too quickly. The ending is also kinda cute in a circular/self-parody kinda way.

I should've savored that guy getting his head punched off into a dumpster, because Jason X may actually be the worst big budget movie of all time.Sure 14 million isn't close to the big budgets of today, but it has the biggest budget of the entire series! (Not counting Freddy vs Jason which has a 25 million dollar budget.) Part 6 is still a legitimately fun movie that was made for less then 6 million. This had nearly 3 times the budget of that and it looks like a student film. Did they hire people that were fresh out of high school to save money??It's set nearly 500 years after...who knows when because Jason went to hell in the last one, so how did he get out? When did he get out? Or are they ignoring that one and making this as a sequel to Jason Takes Manhattan? If that is the case that would be quite fitting. Having two of the worst horror movies ever made directly linked would be a happy coincidence. Anyway, this takes place in 2455 or something because why not?You'd think doing this would be very creatively freeing. You could have Jason wandering around fantastical sets, using futuristic weapons, and maybe you could have the humans of the future be pacifists so Jason could go on an absolute killing spree. But no, instead it's just Friday the 13th in a metal death trap they prentend is a space ship. Which you never buy, even for a second. The film has a blatant lack of imagination to the point of lunacy.Even Jason is completely uninspired in this. He wanders around slashing people with a regular machete. But it's futuristic because it's slightly curved and has holes for some reason. That's really the biggest issue here, a lack of creativity. It's the future because everything is metal and people wear slightly more tattered clothes, but there's still midterms. The sets look absurdly cheap, the cinematography is ugly and constantly underexposed, and the performances are series worst across the board.It's baffling how bad this is actually, and quite difficult to verbalize. This series has been quite the disappointment on the whole but this brings it to unwatchable levels. Even the worst entries have a certain camp or goofiness that keeps them afloat. There is no such thing here. It takes itself deadly serious, which is odd considering it features a robot trying to put fake nipples on to please her programmer. The dialogue is terrible, the premise sucks, the characters are annoying, the kills are bland, the sets are hideous, and it's inexcusably cheap looking for being the most expensive in the franchise (minus the next two).",

Unlike other movie franchises that tried to make the jump into space, the F-13 series really didn't change much; which is a good thing. Many people were glad that Jason eventually left the woods, but like part 8 showed, that wasn't such a good thing. The movie starts off in present time where Jason is going to be frozen, since he cannot be killed. But an accident freezes both Jason & a scientist at the Camp Crystal Lake Research Facility. The movie cuts to the year 2455 next. A scientist & his students are visiting Earth for a scientific expedition (Earth has become a wasteland planet). They stumble onto the facility, & bring back Jason & the scientist's bodies back to their ship. When the scientist is brought back to life, she warns them about Jason, but it is too late. He wakes up & starts on his killing rampage...again. Like in so many movies, Jason is yet 'killed' again, but due to the ship's medical lab, he is 'upgraded' & becomes stronger than ever. Even though the movie takes place in space, it is still a F-13 film at heart. The space environment doesn't change that. The movie is fresh, with some great death scenes & nice one-liners. And the ending leads up to a new sequel. Since this movie has been getting some decent reviews & has made some money, hopefully we will get a new F-13 film or the long delayed 'Freddy Vs. Jason' film very soon. This movie is a lot of fun...go check it out!",

Just as he's about to be frozen, David Cronenberg shows up to take him away, and he and his people are killed by you-know-who(he uses a magically appearing machete). Rowan, a scientist, traps him in a cryogenic chamber that evidently allows both of them(she's put to sleep too) to move after they shouldn't be able to. Years pass, somehow with no one stopping to check on this area, and Earth dies... yet the power remains on. We're about ten minutes in, people. I've already lost count of the plot holes. Anyway, he's brought onto a ship centuries later, and goes on the largest murder spree(there is no stalking in this, though a portion or two has him viciously attack without us knowing exactly where he is at first) of any of these, with an excessive amount of characters(most of whom are easily forgotten, and a few of whom are obnoxious) so that you will not be able to remember everyone(even not-Tony Todd and female Data), to ensure that many can be wasted. This has great FX and is filmed and edited quite nicely. It's too bad that nothing has an impact. We don't care about anyone and the futuristic sci-fi action setting takes a lot of the power of the untimely demise of anyone(can't everyone just use that nano-thing to heal?). With that said, they do get cool, unique death scenes out of where and when we are... in fact, the majority of them are creative and memorable. This is a bit like a low-rent remake of Alien(with a bit of Cameron's sequel thrown in for good measure) with Mr. X in place of H.R. Giger's infamous creature. The designs are nice. Dialog is poor, as is acting. This is never funny, in spite of countless attempts. There are points in this where you have no idea where people are in relation to one another. This is 84 minutes long sans credits. The DVD comes with an interesting and occasionally amusing commentary track by the director, writer and producer, two featurettes that I will review on their individual pages here on the site, Jump to a Death and a theatrical trailer. There is a lot of violence, blood and gore, and a little sex and nudity in this. I recommend this to fast-food type fans(if you want a fix, nothing that lasts) of slasher flicks and this franchise. 5/10",

I'm a die hard fan of the Friday the 13th movies, and other fans have to agree that this movie rocks because it's all about Jason. And now way he's a sell out unlike other villians... Jason Voorhees returns and now the devil has something to fear.\nFor example, pretend it's your birthday and you are 8 years old. It's your day, and everything it's only for you : the clown, presents, the cake, everything. Your parents pay for a birthday party with the purpose that you will have more fun that the others. JASON X is the same case. The fans pay to see JASON doing his favorite thing : slashing dumb teens and anyone that gets on his way. Fans complained in JASON GOES TO HELL because there wasn't enough Jason, and in JASON X we get Jason all the time! Besides we get PLENTY of gore, creative death scenes, a very very PI**ED off Jason, hot chicks, a cool setting, even a good score.THE OLD DAYS... In some moments, the feeling inside the previous Friday the 13th movies was present. The creepy atmosphere, the \"ki ki ki\" and Jason looking mean brought some old memories. *MINOR SPOILERS* All of the death scenes show that Jason hates any living thing, and this time around he has no compassion for anyone unlike in previous films. Oh no, Jason shows no mercy. His machete had a lot of work in this one. The VR Camp Crystal lake setting is pure gold! It shows Jason in all of his glory. Those were the days where Jason would slash anyone around his territory. The death scenes, the score, the direction (which I must say is pretty good) and of course Jason brought the Friday the 13th style back. -END OF SPOILERS-THE NEW FRIDAY THE 13th Ok, maybe the plot is kind of (!) cheesy but the series needed a new story. The film has lots of black humor and this is why some people think that it's a cheesy film in general. Sometimes the humor is necessary to break tension.Overall, this is a good slasher and it's because there's Jason Voorhees. This is a movie to add proudly to the Friday series, and that's it. It won't change future plots, and it won't change Jason's fate. This is a reward for all the die hard fans that waited to see Jason lifting his machette again.Yes, we waited 9 years for this movie to happen, and I'm proud to say that the wait was worth. JASON X will be followed by  FREDDY V.S. JASON next summer. Movie in which Jason Voorhees will kick some seriously Freddy's ass! Come on, we all know that our loved hockey masked killer is the best out there. Just wait to see. Long live to the Friday the 13th movies!",

The storyline is very \"alien\" like where a ship in space comes across an old spacecraft with Jason cryogenically frozen inside. Of course Jason receives an electric current that sparks him back to life and the killing spree begins. This movie is directed by James Issac (Pig Hunt) and stars David Cronenberg (yes, the director), Peter Mensah (300 and Spartacus), Lexa Doig (Andromeda) and Markus Parilo (Fargo). The storyline for this isn't that great and reminded me of a made for television film in terms of the special effects, especially the outer space scenes. I did like the virtual reality game components, and the old hockey mask in space scenes and references, but there isn't much memorable here outside space being the primary setting. Well, Jason did have the scene where he dry iced her face and smashed her head on the sink...that was cool. Overall, I'd say this is better than Jason Goes to Hell, but still nothing special overall. I'd score this a 4.5/10.",

            "content": "Warning: may be some spoilersYou know, back in the day, Jason was actually scary.  He was a true killing machine that could strike fear in those that watched his films and worshipped him in some way.  But as the films and years went on, something strange and unfortunate happened; Jason got incredibly bland and worse than that he became a cheap caricature of himself.  Jason was once the epitome of fear, now he is just an after-thought.  This is a tangential film that only bears the villains name to remind us what once was.  And my advice to Sean Cunningham is to either stop making the Friday films all together or get back to the old formula or what was once remembered as a proud franchise that pioneered the horror craze in the 80's is going to sink under it's own ineptitude.  And this is coming from one of it's biggest fans.  Please, make it better.Can you remember back to the early Friday's?  Can you remember what made watching the films so much fun?  It was the fact that first of all, Jason was scary but moreso he was also very phlegmatic, like Michael Myers was. He didn't take things personally, he just killed without passion.  He was the ultimate killer.  In the first four films, Jason was nothing more than a boy who had grown up to kill with an insatiable need for blood and corpses. Now the franchise has gone off on it's own little tangent and subjected Jason to a ridiculous folklore that just doesn't fit with who he was.  Part 9 dropped the ball by inundating us with that stupid \"special knife\" story and a sister angle when all of us know damn well that he was an only child. Face it, unless you are George Lucas, you cannot introduce family members late into a story and get away with it.  So Jason goes to Hell with Freddy bringing him there but now he in space and he decides that he has to kill again and again and again but with no real passion.  There is no stalking in this one, there is no desperation.  All we have is Jason rounding a few corners and killing the next person that no one cares about.  At least in the earlier ones we knew a little bit about who he was killing.  Think Tommy Jarvis, think Shelly, think of Chris, think of Ginny and Paul and Rick and so on.  There was at least a bit of character development to the people that Jason was slaughtering.  There was also a legend and most of all there was atmosphere.  And correct me if I am way off base here, but didn't James Cameron already take this premise and do it much better in 1986 with guys like Bill Paxton, Lance Henrikson and Michael Biehn?There was one very well done scene in Jason X and that was when he is in VR Crystal Lake.  Someone else commented that all of a sudden the film became interesting again when he was there.  You could hear the music, you could see the cabins and the lake and suddenly that comforting feeling of Jason at Crystal Lake was omnipresent again.  Jason X doesn't have the slightest idea of what it was that made the franchise so successful in the first place. \nThis is one of the lousiest films I have seen and I was sure that nothing could top part nine and eight as the worst Friday's but this one does.0 out of 10",

Betsy Palmer was in the neighborhood when they were shooting Jason X but she just say NO to appear in this, for me, the worst in the series. I had difficulties watching it, and I even almost fall asleep. Jason goes to space and immediately I remembered the other failure were pinhead goes to space. For me it's just not done. Even as the amount of killings is the most here in part 10. It's the killings that made me yawn. We've entered the era of CGI and that's what we are getting. Some are good and couldn't be done without CGI, just look at the scene with the girls frozen face. Although Halloween did it before without CGI with the burned face of a nurse in boiling water.

            "content": "In the year 2455, a group of students on an trip to visit \"old earth\" and find two cryogenic ally frozen bodies. One is a young woman ( Lexia Doig) and the other is none other than Jason Voorhees(Hodder). They bring both bodies on board their spacecraft, where both subjects eventually thaw out and the one wearing the goalie mask goes on a murder spree.When I first heard that the 10th entry in the franchise is gonna be Jason in outer space, I thought that it sounded stupid and was gonna be rubbish but when I saw the film I was pleasantly surprised, sure it was corny and the story line is ridiculous but I loved it Jason is back and he's on form unlike the disappointing previous entry \"Jason Goes To Hell\".This 10th chapter in the \"Friday the 13th\" franchise retains the same energy as the previous entries but delivers it in a spaceship setting. You want to see Jason put \"Rambo\" to shame as he hunts down some ex-grunts? Right here, a-holes! Or how about Jason going mano-a-mano against a leather-clad, gun-toting female Android? You got it! Jason X has its fair share of slash and crash, but at the same time, it emanates an \"Aliens\" (an obvious inspiration) type of vibe. Some purists might say that's a negative thing, but I believe that after nine films, Jason needed a change of scenery like I needed a new \"bootie call\". They slapped old hockey-puss in space and managed to pull it off. Props to all! Okay the film is low budget but I found the special effects were pretty good, the spacecraft simple yet effective costumes are colourful. I particularly enjoyed the S&M-like outfit that Kay-Em (Ryder) sported after getting her robotic cherry popped. Nice! Our boy Jason hasn't changed much. He felt more human this time around though (he has hair!) and doesn't look like the zombie he was in part 6-7-8-9. I found Jason less menacing than he was in \"Friday The 13th Part 7\", but he still got the grisly job done. I also loved it when Jason gets the big terminator style makeover where he's all metal and robotic and such and such like. The fight sequence between Jason and the robot woman is definitely the highlight of the film and the kills are wicked and fresh.The good thing is that \"Jason X\" is just a good cheesy slasher and it doesn't pretend to be anything else but that. Yes, the good guys are weak and the film doesn't always capitalise on its groovy situations but we still get lots of explosions, kills, fights sequences, some occasional funny dialogue, some humorous situations (loved the Virtual Reality sequence) and Jason even gets to re-visit \"Crystal Lake\" to entertain two female campers in his own charming way.Kane Hodder (Jason) gives Jason more of a human personality this time around, but I didn't find him as threatening as he was in the previous entries. Lexa Doig (Rowan) handles her part well, but I would've liked to see her kick more ass. Lisa Ryder (Kay-Em) steals the show as the sexually curious, Kung Fu android. She has fun with the role. Jonathan Potts (Professor Rowe) does the pathetic creep thing well, but yes, he irritated me. Melyssa Ade (Janessa) is cute and her delivery is on, but her character didn't do it for me. She's kind of despicable. Peter Mensah (Sergeant Brodski) was charming as the resilient Marine. I loved every second that he was on screen. Chuck Campbell (Tsunaron) bored me as the geek and he had his moments of \"weak\" acting.All in all being a hardcore Jason fan I absolutely loved this entry in the Friday The 13th series, I loved the female robot, the action sequences, the kills and the over the top special effects.",

So why not go to outer space and kill people in the future? Why not freeze Jason Voorhees and resurrect him hundreds of years later? Because at this point, do you really care?That said, the kills are actually quite well planned out and creative. The nudity is there. The characters are as silly as the previous camp counselors. It really doesn't take itself that seriously, which really works in the movies favor. It's complete camp, and that's the best thing they could have done.",

Jason X had the good fortune of following 1993's Jason Goes to Hell, where the formula had already been flushed down the toilet. Jason Goes to Hell was so bad and by comparison Jason X fares extremely well. So, why not send Jason to space; I mean, it's something he hadn't done before. If you put yourself in the right frame of mind and realize that you have to have zero expectations; Jason X goes down rather well, surprisingly enough.In an amusing prologue, featuring David Cronenberg no less, Jason gets frozen along with a female scientist slated to be his next victim. A crew aboard a spaceship in the year 2455 picks them up and head back to Earth 2 (since our beloved planet earth is no longer habitable). Soon, Jason comes to life again and starts killing off the crew members in his usually grisly fashion. So, what does the year 2455 hold in store for us that's similar today? Well, the most striking thing is that teenagers and adults alike don't seem to get any smarter as time goes by.While this is a silly film, and I mean SILLY (writing, idiotic characters, sci-fi ripoffs from countless films etc. ) Jason X is an enjoyable time waster for fans of the series. His kills are quite inventive and well done, in fact the whole production values of the film were impressive, compared to it's low budget. The whole notion of Jason being in space is of course ludicrous but I must admit it turned out to be a lot more enjoyable than I thought.",

            "content": "I have come to the conclusion that a good portion of the people who submit reviews for films like Jason X do so simply for the \"thrill\" of seeing their names or e-mail addresses on screen.  Seems a lot of you would be better off attending an autopsy in your area than watching a movie that is supposed to simply be entertaining.  Given that the previous Friday films had run out of steam, it made all the sense in the world to try to steer the franchise in a whole new direction.  Where the original Fridays were nothing more than T&A/slashfests, it is a formula that loses it's appeal after so many sequels.  If Jason X accomplishes anything here, it is injecting some life into an otherwise stagnating series.We know Jason cannot die...he has proven that, time and again.  Thus, we no longer watch to see if he will finally be killed.  Instead, we wait for him to die, just to see how he'll manage to come back anyway!  The method of this in Jason X is obvious from early on, but it still works.  The \"new and improved\" Jason is worth the wait for, even though he is not on screen all that long.As has been the staple of all the previous installments, the characters in Jason X were, for the most part, just killings waiting to happen.  I think it's a safe bet that, if there is a Jason XI, it won't involve anyone from MENSA!  Face it, the characters in any Jason film are there for the sole purpose of running, screaming and dying.  Any personality or acting ability that shines through, above and beyond those three things, is always a plus. In this case, I found most of the acting very credible, considering the circumstances.  I was especially taken by Melyssa Ade (Janessa) who, in my humble opinion, stood out in every scene she was in.  All I can say, to those of you who are reading these reviews before renting Jason X, is to go ahead and rent it, and watch it with an open mind.  If you're looking to be entertained, it does deliver the goods.  If you're looking for a 90 minute bloodbath, maybe Faces of Death would be a better selection for you....",

Along with Jason was Rowan(Lexa Doig)who tried to stop Jason back home on earth where they were both found..it was indeed her who trapped Jason in the cryogenic chamber, was stabbed by Jason using his trademark machete from the inside through her on the outside which opens the coolant to freeze her as well. She understands what kind of zombie monster he is as explained with how they tried many other aspects and methods of death which wouldn't end him. One by one members on board try and fail to stop Jason. Those still alive for the time being contemplate how to escape the ship before he catches up with them.This New Line release, much like the ninth film(JASON GOES TO HELL), takes the Jason model and tries to spin a new, different type of story set in the future allowing the monster fresh new ways to kill humans. Supporters of Jason enacting bloodshed in his normal environs might balk, but a chance to see him out of his normal routine is refreshing. And, the flick plays it's wacky premise to the hilt. The computer effects are decent, if less stellar than normal bigger-budgeted films, but the gore is on display aplenty. One poor soul is cut in half, another is thrown on a drill(the scene shows the man's body sliding down the screw piece), and in the film's best sequence a female medic's head is submerged in cryogenic fluid and smashed over a counter as it shatters into pieces. There's an amusing holograph sequence where they buy time to survive by creating an illusion of Crystal Lake with two nudie cuties distracting Jason. There's even a female android who does battle with Jason(it isn't much of a contest as she has superior firepower that subsequently blows him to bits)..when it appears that he is finally conquered, he is reconstructed by a mechanical device that can repair torn tissue and muscles, into a half-cybernetic being! This is clearly a flick designed for the Friday audience allowing us to see Jason doing what he does best, killing innocents who try their damnedest to escape the terror that awaits them.",

Do yourself a favor and take it with a grain of salt; that's obviously what the filmmakers did. It's a slasher film set in space; what did you expect, \"Citizen Kane\"? Granted, the whole slasher-in-space thing has been done before with \"Hellraiser: Bloodlines\" and \"Leprechaun 4: In Space,\" but neither of them were this much fun.First off, we're shown Jason (Kane Hodder) inside a government research lab, never explaining how he escaped from Hell after the ninth film. This is actually explained in \"Freddy vs. Jason,\" which was still stuck in development hell at the time, but if you need any explanation, here's one as good as any other: yes, Jason was pulled into Hell, but they were afraid he'd take over, so they threw him back.Anyway, in an attempt to move the world's most infamous undead mass murderer to another facility, oops... he escapes, killing David Cronenberg and about seven other people in the process. Project head Rowan (Lexa Doig from TV's \"Andromeda\") manages to freeze him cryogenically, but at the cost of her own non-cryogenic status as well. Fast-forward about four hundred years, and the Earth has become uninhabitable. Human colonists from another planet light-years away descend upon the ruined Earth on a \"field trip,\" and guess who they find? Though Rowan is fortunate enough to finally be resuscitated by them, unfortunately, so is Jason, and he goes back to doing what he does best on board the ship after awakening to the sound of - you guessed it - horny young people doing the dirty. Their only hope is Rowan, android Kay-Em 14 (Lisa Ryder, also of \"Andromeda\"), and a very bad-ass Sergeant Brodski (Peter Mensah of \"Avatar,\" \"300,\" and \"Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles\").Is \"Jason X\" a great movie? Of course not. But that doesn't mean that it's never entertaining. Horror film fans don't go to movies like this to see Oscar-winning performances; they go to see a huge masked guy with a machete who knows how to wield it. Furthermore, in spite of the movie's flaws (of which there are admittedly many), at least this entry in the \"Friday the 13th\" series takes us out of the whole Camp Crystal Lake setting for once. If this isn't your kind of movie, don't watch it. If it is, grab a few friends and drinks and riff away.",

            "content": "\"Jason X\" is eight years removed from \"The Final Friday\" in which Jason supposedly went to hell. I guess he was just visiting. The \"Friday the 13th\" series jumped the shark ages ago, so nothing in this movie surprised me. They'd long since dispensed with the notion of Jason being human, so why shouldn't he be alive in the year 2455?The movie actually starts in the year 2010 in a facility of some sort where Jason is slated to be cryogenically frozen until a time in which mankind can figure out a way to kill him. He was frozen, but not before adding a few more bodies to his kill count.Over 400 years later he gets discovered and unfrozen whereby he picks up killing again.The premise is quite ridiculous, but at this point I'm used to ridiculousness with Jason. It can't be any more ridiculous than him being brought back to life with a lightning bolt after being dug up from his grave as was done in part 6.\"Jason X\" had some throwback moments in it such as the \"Crystal Lake Research Facility,\" a couple of notes of the ominous music, and some horny young adults. The bulk of the movie takes place on a spaceship, so there were no lakes to go skinny dipping in. Killing Jason was just as impossible as it had always been. It seems that even in the future there are no hand-held weapons that can stop him. He was shot countless times and impaled with a giant hook before an android used a high enough caliber weapon to take his limbs and his head off. That was just a temporary setback because he landed on a regeneration machine that turned itself on and began repairing him with nanobots. He killed a few more people and was killed by being hurled towards Earth 2 (Earth was uninhabitable) where he presumably burned up entering its atmosphere.\"Jason X\" was wholly unnecessary except to make an even number of ten movies or just to say that Jason was active in the 80's, 90's, and 2000's. Final kill count was 21, not including the girl who killed herself trying to get away, or the unknown amount of people at Solaris docking station that the ship plowed through because Jason killed the pilot.",

            "content": "I've always felt a very deep sympathy for Kane Hodder. Kane Hodder, if you didn't know, has played Jason Vorhees in every Friday the 13th movie since Friday the 13th Part VII. I mean, this guy's whole career consists of stalking people with a giant machete and hacking them to bits. And after watching Jason X, I felt an even deeper sympathy for him.Jason X begins in 2010. The government has Jason Vorhees imprisoned and are keeping him alive to study. They figure that anyone who stays alive, despite being killed several times, is worth studying. Rowan (Lexa Doig) feels otherwise. She thinks that he should be put away where no one can find him. Something goes awry and Jason is loose. He disposes of everyone, with just Rowan left. She attacks him and throws him into a Cryogenic unit where he begins to freeze. But, before he freezes completely he stabs his way through the door, and Rowan gets frozen as well. It's now the year 2455. Earth is no longer inhabitable. Professor Lowe (Jonathon Potts) leads a group of students to the remains of Camp Crystal Lake. They find the two frozen bodies and are able to bring Rowan back to life. They assume that Jason is dead and send him to be examined. While being examined, he suddenly wakes up and goes on a wild rampage once again.\t The whole story feels like a bad episode of Andromeda. Nothing really ever makes sense and random things occur that have no relevance to anything. In the first few Friday the 13th movies, Jason actually had a motive, albeit a bad motive, but at least he had one. In Jason X he just knocks people off one by one for no apparent reason. He doesn't know these people, and they aren't remotely related to anything that happened at Camp Crystal Lake, so why murder them?The script, by Todd Farmer, is full of ridiculous dialogue, thickheaded characters, and absurd situations. You'd think by the year 2455 that these people would have seen enough horror movies to know not to split up when there's a maniacal killer on the loose. And they should definitely not assume that the killer is dead when, in fact, he never is. The characters speak the most blasphemous dialogue. These characters seem to think it's necessary to crack a joke right before they die, as if Jason might find the joke funny and spare them. All ten of the Friday the 13th movies all pretty much stick with the same story and setting. Why they needed to upgrade Jason and set it in a spaceship, I don't know. Jason X couldn't stray father from the original even if it tried. The only thing that this and the nine other movies have in common is Jason. Even Jason is starting to look a little worn out. And then just when you thought that the movie couldn't get any more pathetic, Jason gets an upgrade. Jason falls into an upgrade machine that makes him bigger, faster, and meaner. He even gets a new mask!When a movie has a body count higher than the number of people that are going to see it, it's not a good sign.---------0/10",

I'm a fan of both Lexa Doig and Lisa Ryder, who've swapped roles here with Lexa being the strong female lead and Lisa playing the android. The pace is great, the actors are professionals, a number of whom have hopped around quite a bit in both film and television, and regularly find work. Plot? Seriously? It's a Friday the 13th film staring Jason Voorhees. If you have the nerve to call yourself a film aficionado, why are you watching a slasher film series that began in the 1970s? And yes, I was there at the beginning. These films are made for entertainment and to make money. It's called show business for a reason. Frankly, I think this is the best film of the series since the first one, which broke new ground for horror at the time. This is a 90 minute B movie that's meant to be an entertaining story. It's not Star Wars, nor is it the film that will change lives and how we view the world. It's just some escapism. A mental vacation to get away for a little bit.

It's got mediocre acting all around and the writing is as schlocky as you can get, filled with puns, meta, and references. But it's not as obnoxious as it sounds.I actually really enjoyed this movie, more so than a few of the previous ones in the franchise. It's really silly, but in a good way in that it just doesn't care about trying to be serious anymore. This is the kind of refresh I needed after so many failed attempts to try and make the film serious again.So here the plot is basically moved to the future and instead of a camp its a spaceship jason is confined to. The teens/students on there are still the same characters and still as stupid as any other F13 film. The lead is not very memorable not smart either, as she's supposed to be an expert on Jason but never comes with any ideas.The way jason looked in this film was alright, he's definitely looked scaries, but his final form is great, not scary but definitely designed well. Now about Jason, the kills in this movie are pretty good with one of them added to ''most memorable kills'' in my opinion, which is the frozen face kill. It's also the best kill of this movie but overall the kills are good. Noticeably a lot of the actual 'killing'' gets censored but there's always some kind of aftermath that is used or shown in a interesting/fun way.Overall I felt this movie was paced pretty well, I didn't hang around too much and felt much easier to watch. The music is a bit iffy, the main theme comes back here and there but it's definitely not used as well here. The directing was alright, just about interesting enough but they really didn't care about building much suspense or making it seem like jason sneaked around, he kinda just appears everywhere full frame.There are some ridiculous scenes though like jason flying from the explosion in space and the Android doing some insane action moves. Like I said before this film definitely leans heavily into the comedy/crazy than the serious.For me its a 5/10, not terrible like Jason going to Manhattan, but also not even close to F13 part II because Jason just never became scary anymore, nor an attempt was ever made.",

            "content": "Watching \"Jason X\" gave me the feeling that it was the most expensive Friday the 13th-production ever. It sure was the most glossy, at least.Plot, short: In the beginning of the 21st century, the authorities decides to do away with Jason for good. As many have tried to kill Jason permanently in any way that are possible (as well as a few that aren't) without success, he's now to be contained instead of killed. A young woman manages to freeze Jason in a cryo-chamber. In the process, she also manages to freeze herself as well. A few centuries later, Jason and the young woman is discovered and picked up by a spaceship, and she is revived by the medical staff onboard. Jason, of course, awakens again, and goes for another killing spree.My opinion is that \"Jason X\" is well worth watching, at least if you're a Jason junkie, like yours truly. It has all the necessary stuff for a true Friday the 13th-flick, like hot young chicks, big guy with a hockey mask and a bad attitude, and lots of blood and gore. But I also miss the camp-setting, the dark woods, the cabins, and all that you'll get in the older movies in the series. I really loathe any attempt to scientifically explain what Jason is and why he never stays dead - It shouldn't be explained. Jason's a blood-thirsty freak in a hockey mask, who mysteriously comes back to life every now and then. Period. And I don't like the attempts of portraying him as even slightly human - Blood-thirsty freaks in hockey masks aren't supposed to be human or even likable (in preferred order), just scary. But anyway, the sci-fi-setting was quite nice and different, and I suppose that true low-budget-horror-art like this can stand a few experiments with the setting. But anyway, the way I like it, a good Jason-flick should be about a psycho wearing a hockey mask and killing youngsters in the most gruesome and gory ways imaginable, and \"Jason X\" is. But it doesn't need any expensive CGI or SFX. Ketchup, melee-weapons and gardening tools are more than enough, I'd say.Bottom line: Watchable, but not nearly revolting enough for my taste, and I give it 5 blood-smeared buzz-saws out of 10. Could be worse, could be better.",

Anybody who walks into this film or any Jason (or Freddy or Michael movie) and starts to criticize it may just want to choose NOT to even bother with any of these types of fun movies that are not supposed to be taken seriously.  I think that JASON X was pretty much the same as all the other Jason films... Horny immoral teenagers get punished by a guy that was neglected when he was a child.  His neglection has feuld his rage towards the camp (teeny bopper) counselors SO MUCH, that it has kept him alive to punish all teeny boppers more concerned with their hormones than the safety of kids (notice that he took sympathy on the kids in Jason 6).  Except in Jason X, he just got an awesome look at the end.  And anybody who just can't stand these movies, would really like the end part of this movie, because the producers/director also make fun of their own movie in a way that critics may find amusing.  If they stop at Jason X, it's been an entertaining ride, and if they continue to make these movies, I'll continue paying for popcorn at these shows. Let me to go off on a tangent... think of this .. a movie that parents WILL NOT take their kids to, or would not see themselves.. ONLY gets the numbers of the people who would see the movie or are allowed to see the movie.... BUT.. movies that parents WOULD NOT want to see (like some kids movie or Disney flick) are going to get the numbers of the kids tickets (which are many) plus the parents or the Adults who have to buy a ticket also who normally wouldn't buy a ticket.

Except for the SCREAM-like one-liners (which seem to be a staple of horror movies these days), this is a pretty intense, fast-paced and clever outing.  Well made, stylishly shot, with some clever use of computer effects (hey, now there's a surprise!).Jason is now the subject of a lab. Turns out the reason he never dies is because he's a mutant that regenerates his flesh, limbs, bones, organs, etc; sort of a homicidal X-man.  He is scheduled to be cryogenically frozen until an evil corporate scientist shows up (played with smug relish by David Cronenberg) and demands that Jason be studied further before being frozen indefinitely.Of course, Jason escapes his bounds, but is tricked into the cryo chamber by a clever young female scientist who inadvertantly gets frozen with him. Four hundred years later, the two are unfrozen by a salvage operation run by a professor and a bunch of horny interns (you see where this is going  now, right?), who realize who Jason is (his legacy has survived centuries) and how much he might be worth.Needless to say, Jason wakes up, grabs his machete, and all hell breaks loose.  There's more than just your standard F13 plot here; we've got elements of THE THING, ALIEN, THE MATRIX and even THE DEMON SEED sprinkled throughout. But it plays far more as a tribute to these classics than a rip off. Jason's methods of murder are exceptionally clever as well, such as a woman's face plunged into liquid nitrogen, a man becoming impaled on a giant drill, then twisting all the way down, a girl being sucked out into space through a softball sized hole, and one of the screen's ickiest neck-crackings.  Maybe not the best of the series, but a definite improvement over the disappointing JASON GOES TO HELL, and Kane Hodder is great in his fourth turn as Jason.  Believe it or not, however, the door is still left open for a sequel (FREDDY VS. JASON?!)...",

The actual end result is also far from satisfying and the movie is a pretty bad one, in many different ways.The concept was already quite bad but so is the actual story. They make no secret out of it that the story got very much based on the Alien-legacy movies. Not just with the story but also with the characters really. Of course they also tried to spice up things and update the Friday the 13th series by adding new hip teen stuff. This however works more out lame then good for the movie really because everything in the movie seems so far fetched and the events and characters in it all feel very distant.There of course had been some bad Friday the 13th movies before in the series but what they all had in common was that they got better as they progressed. This movie however only gets worse as it progresses. The story becomes more and more ridicules, which really causes you to laugh more often than to be scared or grabbed by any of it.The movie is all about blood and gore and with this it also relies obviously on some special effects. As an horror movie the movie really falls flat, also due to the fact that it's more busy trying to be a science-fiction flick. Attempts that are in vein though, fore \"Jason X\" as a science-fiction movie also really falls short, not just due to the fact that it is hardly being original but also due to its looks. The futuristic clothes, the technologies, it's just all being too lame. Also the actual special effects are being slightly below par for normal 2001 standards.The movie also really makes the mistake that it allows the Jason character to be the true star of the movie. This means that he gets featured a lot, which makes everything less scary and takes away a lot of the tension of the movie. They even throw in lots of close-ups of him and especially his eyes. Jason is not as much a threatening character when you see his eyes really. The fact that Kane Hodder is again playing Jason can't even seem to safe the character this time and I'm not even talking yet about the Uber-Jason character that pops up in the movie.The movie really feels like a pointless sequel, also because it has so little to do with the rest of the Friday the 13th-series. They should had just skipped this movie and have started working on \"Freddy vs. Jason\" right away, since that was the movie everybody was anticipating for after \"Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday\". This movie seems to completely ignore the fact that \"Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday\" ever happened and it also really isn't staying very loyal to earlier movies within the series, as it's trying to really be a movie on its own that is made to appeal a new, younger audience. A failed attempt though.Really the worst that the Friday the 13th-series has to offer.4/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

            "content": "The Friday series has had a lot of ups and downs.  What started as a fairly suspenseful murder mystery with an Italian horror twist was quickly turned into a Halloween clone by its first sequel.  From then on, scaring was just a thin pretense for films that were only made to wow you with creative deaths.  After making a whole armload of these killfests of varying quality, how do you top it all?  By removing the pretense, revealing all your conventions and then doing a little dance in them.Jason X is a streamlined gore machine, designed to keep raising the bar by having the masked menace kill tougher targets in new ways.  The body count rises to a height you probably can't even imagine and the deaths will have you falling out of your seat.  The human characters aren't just fodder though, they have entertaining personalities and fun dialog which'll keep your interest even when jason isn't there to turn them into red smears.Jason X is particularly a movie for those at least marginally familiar with the Friday line.  If you've never seen a jason flick, you won't be able to appreciate the parody and self-reference that are the major source of Jason X's fun.  You don't need to know anything about the F13 universe or any trivia at all, just being aware of the formula is enough.  (I recommend friday part 4).  So swing by the rental store, have a seat and let the blood fly!",

One is a female scientist and the other is Jason Voorhees who is responsible for murdering eight billion airheads. He will dismember many futuristic idiots aboard a spacecraft including a nasty bout with a female android that is beyond laughable. This is all very predictable right down to the total moron who attempts to reason with Jason only to have his insides double as wallpaper. Jason entraps two women in sleeping bags and beats one with the other. Director James Isaac hasn't improved since making another piece of sh*t called The Horror Show. Like that garbage, his films seem to celebrate the lowest common denominator of humanity. The production values are so pitiful that a third grade art student could not have done any worse. Dreadful acting from Lexa Doig, Lisa Ryder, Chuck Campbell, and Jonathan Potts. They join many others for nothing more than to become part of the celebrated body count. Gee, what a reason to make a movie. To show how many methods of death are available. This is a pointless piece of crap that should be placed in a sleeping bag and beat off a tree. Score: 0 / 10",

            "content": "\"This sucks on so many levels!\" In the horror genre, you have bad movies and then you have bad movies that know they are bad movies. \"Jason X\" is the latter. With nine films in the franchise, there is simply nowhere to go but upwards, and that's exactly where the tenth \"Friday The 13th\" (get it, Jason \"X\"?) takes us. Like Pinhead and Leprechaun before him, Jason is thrusted into the outer reaches of space and resumes his slaughter of bad characters aboard a cheap looking spacecraft. However, unlike previous slashers gone skyward, Jason's adventure in space is actually an enjoyable trip.First things first, this is not a scary, suspenseful or even remotely serious horror film. If you are hoping to squeeze any genuine thrills out of this movie, don't bother. However, if you are a lifelong \"Friday The 13th\" fan who has seen enough of Crystal Lake and doesn't take one's self too seriously, then saddle up and enjoy the best Jason movie in a long while. That's right, I said it. Most people are wound too tight and take their precious genre favorites too seriously, but not me. When I want to unwind on a Friday night, have a few beers and turn my brain off, I find there is nothing more suiting than \"Jason X\". With it's winning combination of nudity, bloodshed, nostalgia (sleeping bags, anyone?) and sense of humor, it doesn't matter that some parts of the film are a bit dodgy. Despite the ridiculous premise -- a group of students find a frozen, hockey-masked, machete clutching meat-bag and thaw him out on the way home -- and the lack of substantial special effects (those exteriors were a JOKE) there is still quite a bit of juice in this installment. Kane Hodder is back as Jason for what would unfortunately be his final round. Hodder goes all out, playing the uber-angry Jason that he created for \"The New Blood\" and even manages to make a ridiculous cyborg version of Jason seem menacing. Director James Isaac, a David Cronenberg (who cameos in this flick) prot\u00e9g\u00e9, delivers an unusually (for this franchise) stylish show, and despite the meager production values, gets the job done effectively. The movie looks good, even when it looks bad, if that makes any sense. It also helps that the movie was built off a script by a Joe-blow nobody fan in Todd Farmer. Farmer apparently loves Jason as much as he watches the SciFi channel, and it shows. You'll have a blast catching all the call-backs to previous movies and the little inside jokes that only a well-versed fan could possibly catch. Now, as you're reading this review, you're probably asking yourself \"What's the downside of this film?\" Well, I'm not sorry to say this; There is nothing wrong with this film. You go into a movie like \"Jason X\" -- the ninth sequel in an overly saturated franchise, which finds the title character in space -- and what do you honestly expect? If you can, God forbid, suspend disbelief, stop taking yourself and the films seriously for 90 minutes, you too will have a blast with \"Jason X\".",

A new group of teenage scientist, on a spaceship, find him and decide to thaw him out. Guess what happens. I believe it was John Carpenter in an interview who was asked if he'd return for another Halloween movie and he asked what else could be done. Carpenter joked they could send Michael to space and I'm going to guess Sean Cunningham and gang heard this and went ahead with this movie. This is a rather strange film because on one hand it has a lot in it to like but on the other hand it's just too stupid to take seriously. What I did like about the movie is the effort of trying something new even if it didn't work out as great as they were hoping. I think more of a flat out spoof would have helped things but as they have it now, the half spoof stuff just doesn't work. The characters are just so downright stupid and annoying that you can't believe any of the set up. Just look at the scene where Jason is thawing out and two of the \"scientists\" are wanting to have sex. This scene, as well as many others, just stick out like a sore thumb. There are some very good moments including one rather long sequence where a SWAT team goes after Jason who must in return pick them off one by one. We also get one of the most memorable kills in the series when one scientist has her face frozen before Jason crushes it on a table. The science-fiction look also comes off rather poor but this here is due to the low budget. There wasn't a single time where I actually felt like we were in outer space. The film does have a fairly nice ending and a great joke involving two cyber girls. As far as the New Line canon is cancered, this is a major step up from Jason Goes to Hell but this isn't enough to enter the top films from the series.",

Big mistake. Jason awakens, reclaiming his machete and, after being vamped up into some sort of half mutant, half cyborg, once more sets about his slicing and dicing antics for our enjoyment. Now, here's the thing: anyone who complains about this movie is genuinely moronic. This is the 10th movie in the series. if you don't like them, don't watch them. Watching it and then complaining is like ordering a pizza then griping that you don't like cheese. Oh, and there's plenty of that here, too. The sci-fi twist is neat, and serves well as an excuse to reanimate Our Hero, and Jason's Borged up new look is pretty damn cool. The last twenty minutes descends into your usual running, screaming, chopping scenario, but it's to be expected. David Cronenberg puts in a cameo near the start, too, to lend the movie an air of respectability. An average slasher, then, but with at least a dash of originality.",

Anyone who goes to see slasher trash expecting logic deserves to get burned.The movie starts out well, with jason held in a secret containment facility after numerous attempts to execute him have failed.  Atmospheric design and some good visuals.  The problems arise when he gets thawed out 450 years in the future on board a spaceship.  Cue 80 minutes of derivative horror sci-fi.  It all slavishly follows every clich\u00e9 first established so brilliantly by Alien(s) and resurrected in a 1000 straight-to-video titles. We have the cryogenics, the dark, industrial corridors, the gung-ho marines getting wiped out, the corporate guy betraying everyone to make his fortune. All very predictable, but oddly entertaining.  The special effects are surprisingly competent, Isaac's direction better than a special-effects-technician-got-lucky should be.  Lisa Ryder 'going a bit Lara' in black leather is excellent.  But the script is terrible and betrays all the faults of a woefully inept first timer.  Manfredini's music is VERY bad, and incorporates nothing of the classic moody effects he provided for the original.  Even the killings are tame, and have nothing of the splatter shock of the early eighties - blame 90's irony and the need to bring in the lucrative teen market for that one.A bad movie, make no mistake.  It's trash, but it pretends to be nothing more, and is oddly entertaining as a result.  Certainly not worth the price of a cinema ticket, but definitely a good video to rent after a few pints.",

Unfortunately it can't capitalise on the claustrophobic possibilities of a serial killer stalking a spaceship's crew members one by one.Bland characters and a cheap, television movie look are prominent setbacks. This tenth entry, despite breaking free from its 1980s violence limitations, is also strangely tame in its kills, with the majority of them taking place offscreen, leaving the audience to view the grisly aftermath instead. No doubt a consequence of its low budget.But despite all the negative points in this science fiction horror, there's a late burst of creativity. Jason Voorhees is dispatched and everyone thinks the threat is over, but due to some futuristic nanotech reconstruction, he is reborn as \u00dcber Jason - an undead/cyborg hybrid that looks like something the Nazi's would have made via necromancy in some crazy alternate reality (think the video game Wolfenstein). Seeing this Terminator-styled monster become even more unstoppable adds some much needed energy in the final stretch, making this final film in the franchise a watchable, if lacklustre, instalment.5/10",

In order to at least contain Jason, the plan is to freeze him in cryogenic suspension; but, as usual, things go horribly wrong and he breaks free to resume his murderous ways. The sole survivor of this latest rampage, Rowan, manages to lure Jason into the cryogenic chamber, but before she can complete the process and escape, she is mortally wounded and frozen in time along with Jason.Flash forward over four hundred years to 2455.The place is Old Earth, now a contaminated planet abandoned for centuries, a world of violent storms, toxic land masses and poisoned seas. Yet humans have returned to the deadly place they once fled; not to live, but to research the artifacts of the lost civilizations that caused this enormous environmental disaster. Little does the most recent landing party of interplanetary explorers realize the fate that awaits them when they stumble upon an unusual find from a primitive technological age.The student explorers, led by Archaeology Professor Lowe and their tech-droid KAY-EM 14, enter the ancient underground remains of the Crystal Lake Research Facility. There, they make a major archaeological discovery: two frozen ancestors; a beautiful young woman and a large man wearing a strange mask. There's only one problem: the auto-regeneration procedure has somehow been triggered. The frozen cry-jell is melting like a block of ice and soon the two bodies will thaw and deteriorate! With time running out, the young explorers return to their starship and blast-off for Earth II, where they are surprisingly able to revive Rowan, the young woman. But very soon, these students will come face-to-face with a shocking, totally new form of evil as Jason comes back to life as well and begins to silently stalk them through the corridors of the spacecraft.Forget what has gone before.

Jason X has a couple of cool looking kills (the ice face and the Supergirl with a shotgun) and has Kristi Angus who is amazingly hot, but other than those few positives, the rest of this movie was bad.  It was a bad movie when compared to other \"non-slasher\" movies and even by handicapping this film against it's predecessors, it still is not well made. The cheesy effects that pepper the screen throughout, which are suppose to make the film futuristic, just come across corny and cheap.  I will give the filmmakers a break on the make-up, because I realize that the film had to be cut for US release but splashes of blood instead of full-blown gore is not an adequate substitute.  Why could Part 9 be released un-cut on video, yet the DVD of X is cut?I liked the first ten minutes of the film, the reemergence of Jason while being examined, Ms. Angus and the kills outlined above.  I hated the CGI, bad make-up, stupid plot, bad acting, poor direction, \"uber-Jason\", and the ending.Note to New Line Cinema: veto any ideas for Jason going to Disneyland, Mars, Japan, Atlantis, or anywhere else besides Crystal Lake.  In my opinion if this was the best idea that came out of the Cunningham braintrust, it may be time to pull the plug and have Freddy kill Jason and have Freddy continue onwards and upwards.I think that this movie is better than Parts 5 and 8 and I think that Parts 7, 6, 9, and 4 are the best of the bunch because they bettered the ideas introduced by the first three.  They are action-packed and half-way smart, while 10, 5, and 8 are far worse than the original three and nearly unwatchable.This movie deserves 2 out of 10.  SPOILER: The best part of the DVD is that you can choose a death to jump to, so you should watch the first ten minutes (stop when they are frozen) and jump to the deaths of Andrienne and Jason 1 and then consider yourself lucky that I just saved you over an hour of bore.

Paramount sold the franchise to New Line Cinema after JASON TAKES MANHATTAN and the film's concept is just really cool.Not only I'll review this, but like the remake of Jason, Halloween and Freddy Krueger, I will defend this movie. The story for this film is that Jason gets frozen and no one discovers him until 2455. By this time, Earth no longer exists and everyone lives on a planet called Earth II. Jason gets brought to life by a group of students / teachers that went to Earth to explore the land or something and he starts killing people on board the ship.A lot of critics and fans actually hated this one and says it is worse than \"Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday\", but actually, I don't mind this film at all because there are two Jason's, but they are played by the same guy.The acting is dreadful in a few areas, but I can easily overlook that. Kane Hodder plays Jason and he does good with his screen time, although this would be his final appearance as Jason and he is alright. This is all sci-fi with a mix of horror. Jason Goes to Hell was bad, but I find myself watching it once in a while. But, this one is not as stupid or pointless as the other films, like critics and fans did take those films the wrong way. I loved what New Line did to this franchise and to see Paramount getting the franchise back for the 2016 remake, yes, they are remaking it again and that is really cool. Or it might be a sequel to the 2009 reboot, I don't know.Parts 1-4 were really scary and intense, while 5-9 were also scary and much better than some of the pointless sequels in certain franchises and I can see why some of those get a lot of hatred.Overall, JASON X is kind of bad, but in a good kind of way and this film is a guilty pleasure for me. I love the direction, acting, music, visuals, action and horror scenes in this film and Kane Hodder could have not done a better job. I wish I could give this a a 10 out of 10, but considering the flaws that I have with this film, I can't. So I'm giving this a 6.3 / 10.",

Cunningham wanted to ensure that audiences didn't forget about the monster in the hockey mask and gave us a tenth entry, coming 8 years after the previous film. With the last two instalments attempting to change the formula (getting him out of Camp Crystal Lake and then turning him into a body- jumping ghoul from Hell) and becoming two of the most hated entries into the franchise in the process, Jason X faced a battle to bring the well-worn slasher genre to a modern audience. Well, all gore- seeking teenagers love space, right?When the title is a film's cleverest attribute, you know it's in trouble. In the near-future, Jason Voorhees (Kane Hodder) is imprisoned in Camp Crystal Lake's research facility, where a bunch of silly scientists (including David Cronenberg) look to transport him to another location in order to carry out further research. Naturally, Jason breaks free and kills everyone, just before being frozen along with the sexy doctor Rowan (Lexa Doig). They are discovered almost 500 years later by a group of explorers from Earth II, who take the two corpses aboard their ship, bringing Rowan back to life using advanced science. With Jason now established as a supernatural being who cannot be killed, he is soon alive and kicking and butchering the annoying crew one by one.With the post-modern horror boom still in full swing thanks to Scream (1997), Jason X plays mainly for laughs. Clearly made with the series' fans in mind, it features various winks at the audience and just may have worked had the script, actors and production values been anything other than abominable. Bad special effects can have its charms, but Jason X looks like a mid-shelf TV show most of the time, with the only inspired effect coming from a poor female doctor who has her face frozen with liquid nitrogen and then smashed to pieces on a work surface (one of the best Jason killings in the entire franchise). Rather than being funny, it feels symbolic of what a parody of itself the series has become. The fans will surely disagree, but the Friday the 13th films have never been good, and Jason X is the poorest of them all. It may not tell us how to kill Jason once and for all, but it demonstrates how to kill a franchise.",

            "content": "JASON X is the tenth Jason Voorhees picture in his long-running Friday THE 13th franchise and it was released in April of 2001 and the film gets a lot of hatred. Paramount sold the franchise to New Line Cinema after JASON TAKES MANHATTAN and the film's concept is just really cool. Not only I'll review this, but like the remake of Jason, Halloween and Freddy Krueger, I will defend this movie. The story for this film is that Jason gets frozen and no one discovers him until 2455. By this time, Earth no longer exists and everyone lives on a planet called Earth II. Jason gets brought to life by a group of students / teachers that went to Earth to explore the land or something and he starts killing people on board the ship.A lot of critics and fans actually hated this one and says it is worse than \"Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday\", but actually, I don't mind this film at all because there are two Jason's, but they are played by the same guy.The acting is dreadful in a few areas, but I can easily overlook that. Kane Hodder plays Jason and he does good with his screen time, although this would be his final appearance as Jason and he is alright. This is all sci-fi with a mix of horror. Jason Goes to Hell was bad, but I find myself watching it once in a while. But, this one is not as stupid or pointless as the other films, like critics and fans did take those films the wrong way. I loved what New Line did to this franchise and to see Paramount getting the franchise back for the 2016 remake, yes, they are remaking it again and that is really cool. Or it might be a sequel to the 2009 reboot, I don't know.Parts 1-4 were really scary and intense, while 5-9 were also scary and much better than some of the pointless sequels in certain franchises and I can see why some of those get a lot of hatred. Overall, JASON X is kind of bad, but in a good kind of way and this film is a guilty pleasure for me. I love the direction, acting, music, visuals, action and horror scenes in this film and Kane Hodder could have not done a better job. I wish I could give this a a 10 out of 10, but considering the flaws that I have with this film, I can't. So I'm giving this a 6.3 / 10.",

I hated it. For reasons I cannot explain, I decided to give it another go to see if my opinion had changed any at all. The short answer is: No - I still hate it. I'm a huge fan of the Friday the 13th series, but I cannot stomach Jason X. You might think that by taking Jason into space, you'd come up with some new, original ideas. Well, you'd be wrong. There's very little new in Jason X that we haven't seen before. The lack of imagination is staggering. And the few things that are new (like Uber Jason) are so ridiculous, it's insulting. Stupid characters played by bad actors, bottom-of-the-barrel special effects, a complete lack of tension or suspense - it's all so bad that my 2/10 rating feels generous. A few very random thoughts:Are there any lights on this spaceship? Why would you go looking for a hulking killer in the dark? Who could have imagined that female scientists in the future would dress like today's highschool girls? And who knew that scientists in 2455 would act just like over-sexed 1980s-era teenagers? The \"space marines\" are beyond useless. Here's an idea - why not split up while searching for Jason? It makes it easier for him to kill you one at a time.Like a lot of other people, I did enjoy the Holodeck scene. It's the only clever thing in the whole movie.Finally, and I'm just guessing, but I can only assume the Jason X screenwriters watched Aliens and Terminator one too many times.",

Jason X is the best of the later sequels. It has an interesting idea, Jason waking up in the future, and a cast that can actually act and that the audience can actually root for. Jason is as menacing as ever (honestly, I could have used more gore, a lynchpin of the originals), and it's quick and fun. Just grab some popcorn and, as usual, turn off your brain.",

Now that he's in the future, he's no longer a threat to Camp Crystal Lake, otherwise it was foolish to revive him in the future. Or is it? The silliest thing I saw in this movie was the CyberJason, OH PLEASE! That really takes the cake. Man I thought Part 8 was bad enough, I was wrong, this movie was twice as silly as part 8. However, the upgrade version of Jason seems rather cool in a maniacal way. At least it showed in his eyes. If they glowed, this movie would have been much better. This movie I'll have to pass on the collection list. The upgrade didn't do me any justice, Jason should just stayed dead. 1 out of 5 stars.",

But it backfired as the film ended up becoming a joke to most and a celebration to few. This could in part be because we were tantalized for years about the proposed Freddy vs Jason and by this point it was what we wanted. Another reason this failed at the box office is because it had been a decade since Jason last stalked his game, and the world had moved on, that's a sad thought. I myself love this movie and could watch it non-stop but then again I am biased as I love the character and the story, I could see if you were not a fan or if you were a fan and expecting more, that this would not be your cup of tea. But to those who only think of this film as joke, you are wrong. This film had lots of heart and took a heck of a long walk to get to screen, the battle that this film had to through to get shown should be made into a movie it was so wicked. Studio Execs leaving, people feeling Jason was not worthy to return, stupid people, and the internet were all causes for this film to be halted, but it prevailed and was shown and I think thirty million is not a bad number for a film that was not properly released or advertised. In the end this film came out swinging and was beautiful, it was the first Jason film I saw in the theater and I was elated. This is far better than Ronny Yu's soiled down Freddy vs Jason that would come a year later. or three years later if you count the fact that Jason X sit on a self at New Line for three years. I wonder how long it will take them to release the new Michael Bay produced remake once completed. My gut says it will go out quickly and be targeted at ignorant people and sell quick thus ruining the integrity that is and forever shall be Jason. See Jason X it well worth it and if you look at it, it is a fine conclusion to the chronicles of The Crystal Lake Slasher.",

There is no high drama or good acting expected in any Friday the 13th Movie. Anyone going in expecting anything in this list is going to be disappointed. Hard core.What we do expect: fine young females showing some titties, having sex and drinking beer. We expect to see some hard core murder performed in unique and interesting ways. We want buckets of blood as Jason fulfills his roll as an unstoppable killing machine. Little details like plot and character development get in the way of what we paid our money to see: Death and lots of it.Given that - how does Jason X stack up? It's an absolutely bad movie in just about every respect imaginable - and it's perfect.It's got all kind of interesting death in it - the first one on the spaceship with the liquid nitrogen springs to mind. The problem is that it hits you with probably the best death right off the bat - so there is some pacing issues with the way the murders play out, but it's hardly something to get worked up over.The movie has the highest body count of any previous Friday the 13th movie - at least 20, with the potential of several thousand if you count the space station that Jason blew up. Those looking for a visceral good time will have everything they want - in spades.The writing is even clever at times. Case in point, the bait used to distract Jason while the heroes get away (to say more would give away far too much).  Suffice it to say that this is a damn funny scene, probably the best moment in the movie. Me and my crew were on the floor laughing so hard I had trouble paying attention to the rest of the movie.\nI was afraid that sly and pretentious films like Scream and Scary Movie had destroyed the horror genre forever with their \"Nudge, nudge - look how clever WE are\" approach to the old school 80's slasher flick. Fear not - this movie trumps those films live never before. I was worried that a series of movies that was over TWENTY years old - teenagers who saw these films on Showtime and HBO in the dark well after they were suppose to have gone to bed who now have teenagers of their own - had nowhere else to go, had no gas left in the franchise. I couldn't have been more wrong.In short, if you liked Friday the 13th 1-9, then part 10 will rock your world.",

            "content": "Just when you think the 'Friday the 13th' franchise has nowhere left to go along comes 'Jason X'. This is the tenth installment in the slasher horror franchise featuring iconic undead machete wielder Jason Voorhees. It had been 9 years since the last iteration of the series and a proposed 'Freddy vs. Jason' crossover film was stalling so this film was concocted to attempt to keep up interest in the character. The Crystal Lake setting had been done time and again and they even took Jason to NYC, so where did they have left to go? Space obviously.This film approaches Jason with a similar mentality as the previous one in that society is aware of his existence and they are trying at various points to capture, understand, study and/or destroy him. Instead of chalking up his undead nature to a supernatural phenomenon they give it a science fiction spin calling it an enhanced regenerative ability. They at first want to study him as a specimen but as Jason is apt to do he escapes and commences a bloodbath before getting frozen in a cryogenic chamber. One woman is inadvertently frozen along with him. They are both found and thawed 445 years later. Earth is uninhabitable and there is an Earth Two. Both Jason and Rowan (the science girl frozen with him) are brought to a spaceship which is a school ship with a professor, students, an android and a few military/security types. Of course Jason is awoken before they really know what they have on their hands and starts his rampage once more. Everyone but a select few, including original girl Rowan, are decimated before Jason is dispatched in space finally ending as a fiery meteor hurtling toward the surface of Earth Two. Of course his meteoric form crashes very near to a wooded lakeside camp.There is now way around the fact that this movie is a piece of junk. It is a hokey idea that looks like it was put together by college kids. This is the same timeframe when Peter Jackson was redefining what was capable with special effects with his 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy. This movie is at the other end of that spectrum, and it is hilarious as director Isaac was primarily employed as a visual effects supervisor for other films. The acting is horrible, visual effects are bargain basement level and the costume design is amateurish and bizarre with most of the girls in weirdly skimpy attire. While the budget of $14 million isn't that high it is more than the previous four 'Friday the 13th' films combined which I guess just goes to show if you want to aid science fiction effects, even bad ones, they are going to cost you. This film did have a few wonderful death scenes which is about all you can hope for as you are pretty much expecting the rest of the movie to be bad. Most notable was Jason forcing a girl's head into a cryogenic fluid sink instantly killing her and freezing her head which he then smashed on a counter to a gloriously gory effect. Then there is the Terminatrix android vs. Uber Jason after they both get upgraded by a computer system. I thought the Uber Jason was going to be more of a thing but he really only comes in at the tail end which is a bit of a disappointment. Like most Friday the 13th films there is some mild entertainment value. It is always fun to see Jason stalking around doing his thing, however, always disappointing to see a piss poor movie surrounding him while he does his stabby stab thing.Eric's Grade: F.",

The premise was kinda overdone considering we'd already seen certain celebrated monsters make their voyage into space i.e. Pinhead in \"Hellraiser:Bloodline\" and Leprechaun in \"Leprechaun in Space.\" This film and particular Jason movie looks like it was produced by the Sci-Fi channel. This is how mediocre it looks. I can't believe this movie was released in theaters. It looks more of a direct-to-video effort. I guess since the Friday the 13th series is one of the most successful horror franchises then they were obligated to release this theatrically.

It's a contradictory film from scene to scene. On one hand, it fancies itself a subversive satire along the lines of \"Jason Lives\", yet it only delivers the occasional jest at its own expense. On the other hand, if often plays the material straight for attempts at honest thrills, yet these are contradictory to its lighter moments. It occasionally gets the idea that it's an effects spectacle on the rare occasion for more complex sequences, but it's hindered by a low budget. Yet it also frequently seems aware of its cheap cost in other scenes.It's like watching someone trying desperately to put together two different jigsaw puzzles after the pieces have become inadvertently mixed together. Nothing fits.We all know the plot... It's \"Friday the 13th\" in space. Jason gets cryogenically frozen (along with sexy scientist Rowan, portrayed by Lexa Doig) in modern times, only to be awakened on a spaceship 400 years later, so he can hack up stupid, nubile teens... in the future!Blah, blah, blah. He kills a few, gets blown apart by a sexy android chick (Lisa Ryder), gets brought back with magical future medical-technology as a half-robotic \"Uber Jason\", and chaos ensues. (That was all in the trailer, so there's no spoilers there.) It's a rinse and repeat of almost every previous film, except now Jason gets a hokey new metallic costume and there's a lot of bad CGI and green-screen effects because, you know... the future! And space!To be fair and give credit where it is due, there's a few positive aspects here. Lisa Ryder steals the show as robotic \"KM-14\" in a delightful little role. There's also some fun to be had with a few high-concept gags like a laugh-out-loud holographic simulation of Crystal Lake in the 80's. And I'd be lying if I said there weren't a few creative kills. (Cryo-freezing someone's face and then smashing it? Yes, please!) There's also a cameo from filmmaking god David Cronenberg, who chews the scenery in a fun-albeit-brief role! (How did they even get him for this movie?! Is he a big Jason fan?)But the film never comes together as I said. I can't help but feel screenwriter Todd Farmer was aiming at something a lot bigger and more bombastic, but kept having to be dialed back by studio-suits and producers over budgetary concerns. A lot of the scenes and plot lines come across as last-minute back-ups that were thrown in in case the studio couldn't afford the intended sequences.The tragedy is that it had a golden opportunity to do so much more. The \"Killer in Space\" trope is such a widely-known clich\u00e9, that putting more effort into subverting and parodying the concept would have given the film a fresher, more unique flavor. It needed to drop its more serious moments and take full advantage of delivering self-aware laughs based around its setting and location. The few times it tries, it works. But it doesn't take enough advantage of this... it's not commenting on the silly \"killer in space\" trope. It's just another example of it being done poorly, while giving us an occasional fleeting wink and nod.Even beyond the failed potential, there's just a whole lot of nothing going on. The effects budget eats up too much money, so everything else- sets, costume design, etc. look cheap and fake. Director James Isaac seems in over his head, and only delivers a minimum effort in his visuals. Series composer Harry Manfredini- usually a reliable musician in his own right- barely seems to try with a really bad and often artificial-sounding synth soundtrack. And supporting roles are among the series worst, with grating characters being portrayed by dime-a-dozen \"pretty face\" actors who would be more at home on Hollister billboards than on-screen. (Shelly from Part III and Megan from Part VI still remain the high point of supporting roles even to this day.)So sadly, \"Jason X\" emerges as one of the weakest films in the series in my opinion. It may think it's something grander than it is, but we as an audience can see that this just isn't the case.It's a 2 out of 10 just for it's few fun moments. But they aren't worth having to slog through 90 minutes to get to.",

Then, of course, there are other links to \"Aliens\" with its female warrior, \"The Thing From Another World\" with the scientist trying to understand the monster,\"It!The Terror from Beyond Space\" with the room-by-room pursuit, a shack that seems to have escaped from \"The Bride of Frankenstein\" and, of course, the virtual young women at camp from numerous proto-movies. What's NOT to enjoy? This film is good, clean fun all the way through.The beginning is terrific, the editing is razor-sharp, the colors and sets are imaginative, the music is riveting (too many minor chords on the organ near the end, though) and the characters, thankfully, are not fleshed out to much.

In fact, the series became a joke when Paramount sold the franchise to New Line Cinema. Anyways, the plot for this is that Jason gets frozen, and no one discovers him until 2455. By this time, Earth no longer exists and everyone lives on a planet called Earth II. Jason gets brought to life by a group of students/teachers that went to Earth to explore the land or something. He starts killing people on board the ship. That's basically it.There is so much bad about this film. The acting is horrendous, worse than any other Friday flick if you can believe it! I hate the turn this franchise took when New Line started making these films. It's all sci-fi. Jason Goes to Hell was a cheap version of Invasion of the Body Snatchers. And this movie is basically Aliens except substitute the ugly creature with Jason Voorhees. Friday the 13th films were originally scary and creepy horror/slasher films set in the woods. Parts 1-4 were amazing because they were simple. Even parts 5-8 were better then this Andromeda/Star Trek rip off.Jason X is kind of insulting to the series. It gets marks for Kane Hodder and one murder in particular. Jason freezes a woman's head and then smashes it in a thousand pieces. One of the more unique 'Friday' kills in the series. But overall, I just hate the direction of the series. Putting horror icons in space NEVER works. Pinhead in Hellraiser Bloodline, Leprechaun in Lep 4, hell even the Critters went to space in part 4. Those sequels were awful and this sequel is awful. EASILY the worst of the series.2/10",

            "content": "After the rather disappointing Jason Goes To Hell, I was almost fearing the worst as soon as I heard New Line were going to take Jason Voorhees quite literally into outer space.  A laughable idea surely, and a desperate one at that.  After much delay though, I finally got to see the movie on July 20th 2002 at a UK cinema no less, the first time a Friday The 13th movie has been released on the big screen here since the pretty awful Part V: A New Beginning back in 1985.  So, first of all, hats off to New Line and Entertainment Film for having the guts to give a tenth film in a slasher series a cinema run in the UK!To say director Jim Issac overcomes the shortcomings of the initial idea, is a bit of an understatement.  Thanks largely to Todd Farmer's competent and sometimes witty script, Issac is able to keep things moving at a good tempo, utilising the larger scope of \"Jason in space\" to come up with some superb set pieces, and a visual style that is far more impressive than anybody has really given it credit for.  A knowing, but mostly controlled sense of humour helps too, preventing the film from being swallowed up by its own outlandish storyline, meaning the final barrage of over the top action during the last 20 minutes work a treat.  Sure, it all becomes rather laughable, but then the film makers are in on the joke too.I can't really understand why so many have attacked the acting either.  I mean, what were we all expecting?  Laurence Olivier or Anthony Hopkins to pop up?  Or maybe, Al Pacino as Jason?  Come on people.  This is a low budget movie, with a young mostly unknown cast, and to be honest it's one of the best collected casts of the entire series (probably the best since Joseph Zito's \"The Final Chapter\").  Indeed, the cost of the film doesn't seem to hinder Issac's ambitions. Apart from the expected top class prothestics, the use of CGI for the space scenes is very impressive indeed ,particularly for a $15 million movie.Finally, a word for Kane Hodder.  Playing Jason for the fourth consectitive time, he's as imposing and serious as ever.  Whilst Farmer's script has fun with the trappings of the series (the jokes about premarital sex etc), never does he make fun of Jason, and Hodder's performance emphasisis this with some magnitude.  This must be the most screen time Jason has been allowed, and to Hodder's credit that despite his frequent on-screen time, he never looses his sense of menace - not once.  The film may not be that scary, but Hodder's Jason always had me glued to the screen.To be honest, Jason X is everything I hoped it would be, and more.  The only real damaging aspect of the film is Harry Manfredini's cheap sounding music score, which threatens to kill any menace Jason has.  If there is a Jason XI, I just hope another composer is hired, because as good as Manfredini's early Friday scores were, his last two, for Jason Goes To Hell, and now Jason X, have in all honesty been pretty dreadful.Placing it in with the rest of the series, it would probably be 3rd on the list, after the awesome \"The Final Chapter\", and the under-rated if flawed \"Jason Takes Manhattan\".  Great fun, just don't, as some people seem to be doing, expect Shakespeare.  Besides, Shakespeare was never this much fun.",

            "content": "Yes, the previous movie released years before this titled \"Friday the 13th: Jason Goes to Hell\" has a bit in common with this movie. In that both movies have really nothing to do with the previous films. Granted part five and six have problems with the story as Jason is said to have been cremated in five, but that is nothing compared to the fact these movies do not even try to acknowledge previous installments of this film, though I am kind of glad they ditched the whole body snatching thing from \"Jason Goes to Hell\". This film has an introduction that is sort of old school, but then it is super futuristic and all and you are introduced to people you want dead. Well I wanted them dead, I never before pulled for Jason so much. The entire movie is like this, when the cyborg fights Jason the first time I was a bit bummed, but I laughed the second time when Jason became Super Jason. So basically, nearly all the characters are annoying and you are stuck pulling for the dude who says nothing, to me not the best ingredient for a horror movie. The film though was trying to be a bit more corny than usual and a bit funny, but for the most part I did not like it. I did like the part where they used the holographic girls to try and slow Jason down and what he did, but most of the comedy was a miss. In the end I almost think they made this movie less to make a serious movie, and more just to get Jason back in the public eye for his match with Freddy. Freddy needed it less because he has more personality than does Jason. There are worse ways to spend ones time, but this is most certainly not the best way, thankfully they never put Jason on a submarine or back in time with the dinosaurs.",

            "content": "Despite being released prior to 'Freddy Vs. Jason (2003)', 'Jason X (2001)' is actually the final entry in the original 'Friday The 13th' series. Set several years after the hockey-masked murderer fought the knife-fingered slasher, the film opens with our villain in chains in an underground research facility. It isn't long before he escapes, kills David Cronenberg and is tricked into being cryogenically frozen by a woman whom he manages to wound in the process. Over four hundred years later, a research team discovers both Jason and the woman who bested him frozen deep beneath the surface of a now-barren Earth. They take the pair on board their spaceship, thaw out our hero, fix her up with nanobots and perform tests on a frozen Jason who's unable to do them any harm... or so they think. As you can imagine, being frozen isn't a big deal for someone who has already been dead several times. When it comes down to it, the crux of the issue with this entry is that Jason going to space, much like Jason going to hell, should be far more interesting than this. Despite an entirely new setting, this is mostly more of the same and it's genuinely dull for the majority of its duration. It's just going through the motions, regardless of its efforts to do something different. The villain himself looks terrible here, with a dingy design that only vaguely alludes to his previously iconic aesthetic, and Uber Jason looks even worse, a supposedly 'cool' amalgamation of bulbous brushed steel and bland black leather. Plus, despite Hodder's as admirable as ever performance, there's something off about the big bad; he just acts like some dude. Though he's as proficient at killing and, well, not dying as ever before, he just isn't imposing and is only about as menacing as a wet tea towel. It feels as though he, too, is just going through the motions at this point, which is weird considering he's doing the exact same thing he's been doing for the previous eight films. The same can be said for the other characters, actually. They may be making their debut here, but we've seen them all before. None of them are anything more than cardboard cutouts, walking corpses given the illusion of life in the hope you'll care when they inevitably return to the vacant shells they so obviously already are. They scream, they scramble to come up with a plan, they scream some more; they're just canon fodder and it doesn't matter which one of them bites the dust next because they all serve the exact same purpose and have only the vaguest semblance of a distinguishing personality. There's this really weird moment where the professor randomly engages in some sort of sex game with his student (whose age is uncomfortably never made clear), having his nipple pinched with a pair of tongs while he wears a sheer negligee and demands he be punished harder, and this never comes back into the plot whatsoever. In fact, I'm not sure the two characters involved even speak outside of this single entirely unnecessary scene. There are a few baffling moments like that, but not so many that the piece can elicit the sort of bemused disbelief that results in an experience that can be laughed at. Instead, it toes the line between bad and fine, emerging as entirely uninteresting because of it. The flick has moments which seem to suggest it isn't taking itself as seriously as some of the other entries in its series, but most of the time it just doesn't seem in on the joke. It's too serious for its own good; a schlocky, tongue-on-cheek approach would have suited the material much better. It does attempt humour on occasion and, though this is appreciated, it's almost entirely unsuccessful. Its cheesy one-liners aren't funny and, because of the silent nature of its antagonist, they're often spoken by characters who are in the process of having their lives ripped away, which is strange to say the least. The cringe is at its strongest when the affair indulges in the sort of turn-of-the-millennium 'coolness' that plagued everything from feature films to television commercials around that time. Irony never comes into play, so the cringe isn't enjoyable, it's just cringe. Though the silliest moments are typically the most successful, the picture isn't funny enough to be classed as horror-comedy. At the same time, it almost isn't scary enough to be classed as straight-up horror. There's very little semblance of atmosphere and the direction is generally flat. Its aesthetic is also a bit inconsistent, and it looks like an incredibly cheap sci-fi TV show way more often than it should. It makes frequent use of the kind of early 2000s CGI that makes you wonder how anyone took digital effects seriously enough to develop them to the point they're at today. In the behind-the-scenes material on the DVD, there's this really funny moment where the filmmakers are talking about how they never used visual effects for the sake of it and only used them to tell their story, and then it hard cuts to the scene where the android's nipples fall off. Whoever edited that behind-the-scenes documentary understands the assignment far more than anyone who worked on the actual movie. The feature has a couple of moments of good gore, including a delightfully gooey scene in which Jason gets a bit of his own medicine, but it's generally quite tame. In all fairness, though, it does continue the franchise's tradition of having one of the best kills in one of the worst movies. If you've seen the flick, you probably know which death I'm talking about; it's genuinely brilliant, a gloriously gory demise worthy of a much better picture. Though this isn't entirely unsuccessful and its attempts at distinguishing itself from its predecessors are admirable, it's mostly dull overall. I appreciate the effort taken to tell a slightly different story this time around, but the differences really are slight and the outcome isn't as effective as most of the other entries in the series. The flick is often fine, but it's generally subpar and is honestly one of the weakest 'Friday The 13th' movies. In some ways, it's even worse than the ninth entry in the franchise. It's way more competent, sure, but it's far less interesting and you can't even laugh at it. For how genuinely terrible 'Jason Goes To Hell: The Final Friday (1993)' is, at least it isn't boring.",

This is a willfully stupid playground for half-baked science fiction ideas, terrible wardrobe choices and budget special effects; a cut-rate production that would feel right at home on the Sci-Fi Channel at 3am. Predictable to the end, it touches all the bases with gratuitous nudity, shallow characters, mysterious returns from certain doom and a truckload of dismemberments / decapitations / deaths. The only thing we're missing is the trademarked screeching cat fake-out, presumably because no self-respecting animal would be seen in such a production. Apart from one fleeting moment of self-deprecating parody near the end - which is totally out of place, but admittedly had me howling - there's no reason for this to exist.

Where do you go from there? Oh, yeah, you reboot the franchise in 2009. And other than that inevitable reboot, 'X' absolutely was the original series finish (despite two of the sequels labeled as \"final\" and not counting the spin off 'Freddy Vs. Jason.') 'X' does start off with a good idea: after finally being captured, studied and executed \u0096 well, unsuccessfully hung, shot, etc, that is \u0096 Jason is set to be frozen. Though a good idea opening, four main questions arise: why leave the mask on? Where did he find a machete? How could he possibly get that machete through a thick metal door (even if Jason had great strength, the machete would still buckle)? And why wait two years after capture to finally attempt an escape \u0096 remember he can simply teleport himself at will anywhere, so why the wait? If you can look past those questions, then you're in store for many more lunacies in the film: horrible special effects, lame humor, plot that utterly rips off of both 'Aliens' and 'Alien: Resurrection,' laughable finale and 445 years later (one character mistakenly says 455, which would've been accurate due to the movie probably was made in 2000, but it's set originally in 2010) and even though the technology has improved, humans seem maybe 4 steps behind today's time. Overall, not the worst 'Friday,' it does have some good action, including an android battle and one of the best series scenes involving their version of a holodeck, which sums up the entire franchise. Favorite line: \"You gotta be kidding me\" in which I repeated the same thing. Watch the closing and you'll understand why.",

It's still one of the better \"horror icons in space\" sequels, easily beating similar films with Leprechaun, Hellraiser, etc., but that's not saying much.

            "review_title": "A horrendous campy sci-fi flick that happens to feature Jason...again",
            "content": "It seems like a lot of horror flicks take their character to space in one instalment or another. Hellraiser, Leprechaun, Jason Voorhees, Aliens...well that one might be a stretch. I don't know why anyone thinks that's a good idea but because this happens to feature one of the greatest slashers in film history, and because of one unique scene this is actually watchable. I think it does represent a definite downward spiral in the series. I think when New Line took over from Paramount for Jason Goes To Hell they lost sight of what this series is all about. I think fans and die hard Jason freaks would have came back twenty times to watch Jason slash his way through Crystal Lake but New Line insisted on changing that up. So here we are 450 + years in the future on the a ship named Grendal and Jason is loose and rampaging like he hasn't missed a beat. The concept isn't terrible, the cast is okay, Jason is still awesome, and I can even accept Uber-Jason and think it was kind of a cool spin however cheesy that is. But even with these things this is a really cheesy, campy, poorly made sci-fi flick. The special effects are simply awful, the beast thing that they shoot in the cargo hold before finding Jason is the worst piece of special effects I've ever seen (and I've watched some cheesy monster flicks.) Why not save the budget and take him back to Crystal Lake? Lexa Doig should be the lead scream queen of the film. There is great potential here for her character as the head of the research project in 2008 who inadvertently gets frozen with Jason for 450 years. Unfortunately Doig is completely underused and almost pointless to the story. Lisa Ryder is deliciously horrible (this is a good thing) as the cyborg/android Kay-Em. Her best scenes are taking on and taking down Jason but her role is hilariously B-Movie magic. She's awful as is the character. Peter Mensah is about the best performance in the film as the tough as nails Brodski. He is way underused because he could have easily been the best character. Unfortunately he gets all camped out in the end looking ridiculous in some CGI scenes of him floating in space. Melyssa Ade is the sarcastic and shrewd crew member. She's fun and has some great lines including one of the best lines in this film and any Friday the 13th film when someone asks what's going on and she says dead serious \"Jason F%$&*ing Voorhees is what's going on.\" Classic. Jonathan Potts is sort of the typical scuzzy lawyer type character that everyone despises. He does well and has some good scenes and is actually pretty good overall. Chuck Campbell is the geeky scientist with a thing for the android. His character is a little underdeveloped given he is sort of a main character but for a campy B-character he is solid. And finally Kane Hodder, the legendary Jason actor returns for this instalment. He's still good in the role, he still IS Jason Voorhees but the unfortunate horrible campiness of this film makes his performance slightly less impressive and uber Jason is a crazy addition that I'm still not sure is good or just stupid.Fairly new director James Issac takes the reigns for Jason X. Since this film he's done a couple of horror films so he obviously likes the genre. I'm not sure what kind of budget or script he was given but I imagine he struggled to make this a half decent flick and you know when its all done and said it isn't the worst thing I've ever laid eyes on. It's watchable. Friday the 13th the entire series let alone the tenth instalment isn't exactly masterpiece film making and is all about the cult following it gains. Someone, somewhere probably loves Jason X. The one brilliant redeeming scene in this film is in the last fifteen minutes when they use a holographic scene of Crystal Lake to distract Jason complete with two young taut teenage campers stripping, smoking dope and tantalizing him. He proceeds to beat one girl with the other in a sleeping bag...again classic. Jason X is for the true fans but for most it'll be hard to sit through. You have to sit back, laugh, enjoy and just remember the whole series in its entirety is legendary. I know because I just watched them all in three days...just for you. 6/10",

Okay, it wasn't exactly the same, as this movie takes place in the future. I remember looking up Leonard Maltin's movie guide and being amazed at the sheer number of slasher films that his book seemed to be cluttered up with! I think \"Friday The 13th\" has the most numbered sequels of anything in his book. It was weird looking up plots and finding out the villains died in the last movie. Every single one of them is back! It was bad enough that they lied to us with \"Friday The 13th Part IV: The Final Chapter\". Then they lied AGAIN with \"Jason Goes To Hell: The Final Friday\". It looks like this is still the last canonical appearance of Jason in this timeline, although they simply made a remake years later. It's weird how they attempted to make the formula different in the last couple of movies. It's a pity they were just as dumb as the originals, if not worse. Anyway, this film features Jason being frozen for hundreds of years and then terrorizing the people on a spaceship. It's weird to see how these supposedly genius scientists are every bit as stupid as the kids on Crystal Lake.They just get killed off over and over like the dumb teenagers hundreds of years ago. I guess you could argue Jason simply became more powerful, but still they should know better. I was amazed at how awful the CGI was in the training simulation. I guess that might have been intentional, seeing as how it was a simulation, but it still looked hideous. We even got to see these guys die twice. I'm glad I watched this on Friday the 13th even if it wasn't in the title. I saw it on the Syfy Channel and honestly, it fit right there with their cheesy movies. *1/2",

Unable to kill him, they figure they can freeze him cryogenically and do research on his invincibility. Naturally that plan goes by the wayside as chaos strikes and many are killed. A woman (Lexa Doig) is able to freeze the titled character anyway (and herself). Fast forward some 445 years (that is not a misprint) to 2455. A moronic space crew of college professors, students and military specialists discover the two frozen and take it upon themselves to unfreeze them. Naturally Jason is still wanting to kill everyone in sight and it becomes painfully ironic that the human race has not evolved one bit as teens continue to get naked, act stupid and pretend like nothing could ever happen to them. Welcome to life in the 25th Century. \"Jason X\" (the X being the Roman numeral for the 10th installment in the \"Friday the 13th\" series) is probably the dumbest and most full-blown dud of the entire group of films. It really has very little to do with the 10 other films of the series (\"Freddy vs. Jason\" is the 11th official movie) and it appears to be a silly ploy to get a new generation of movie-goers to watch this horrid cinematic idea. After an eight-year absence (those were eight good years) the American cinema had to put up with a revolution in this disaster of a series. No end in sight apparently as the series continues to sicken and torment us. Turkey (0 stars out of 5).",

They're horrible.So the basic (spoiler-reduced) synopsis is:Jason gets cryogenically frozen to be thawed 400 years later so he can basically do the same thing he's done during every other movie, but in the future.The characters are unlikable, the story reeks of series fatigue and corporate greed. The movie simply has no purpose. It's missing everything that made most of the earlier entries entertaining. It's just... a hollow slasher where things keep happening, but nothing occurs that's of particular interest to the viewer.I personally disown Jason Goes to Hell and Jason X as Friday the 13th films, because they're horrendous. The eighth entry, Jason Takes Manhattan, should've been the last. Because that movie was actually fun and enjoyable.And, of course, even Freddy vs. Jason ignores this film's existence... good riddance! Never again on this one.",

This Jason movie however is actually well written and has a bigger budget with some good effects. The battle between Jason and the android was neat. When Jason became Uber-Jason that was really good but near the end when the guy is trying to fool jason in the Crystal Lake area was believe it or not to ME was funny. I thought is was funny because the girls were stupid going in those sleeping bags and what happen? Jason picked them bags ups and banged them against the trees repeatedly untill they were dead.

My main problem with the movie is the bland and uninteresting characters which are just their to die. The only interesting characters are Bronsky and the android.

The movie definitely succeeds in the death and gore department right from the opening. I also think the space setting is alright. I also think the tone and atmosphere is okay but not as good as previous installments. The movie fails at a lot of things though. First almost every character is unlikeable and the actors phone in their performances more than I would like. The CGI is also awful they should've gone as practical as possible and removed a lot of the bad effects in the film. The plot is also worse than a lot of the rest of the films in the series.

Along his machete and trademark hockey mask, Jason also brings back the slasher genre in good shape.\nWith all the hype that FREDDY V.S. JASON caused at the time, JASON X delivered expectations and worked very well as an apperitive.I'm a die hard FRIDAY THE 13th fan, probably the #1 in my country (M\u00e9xico) and I enjoyed this movie only because Jason was the main star.\nThe plot is cheesy 100% but who cares? Die hard fans waited 9 years to watch Jason on the screen again. I can still remember perfectly when in 1997 the internet spread a rumor about an upcoming Friday the 13th film. Many fan made scripts were available but no official word until year 2000 when it was finally announced that JASON X began production. Also, in 1997 the media made official a confrontation between Freddy and Jason. I taped the news report in several news programs from M\u00e9xico, and USA. It wasn't until 2001 that the movie was officially announced.Anyways, JASON X is what WE the die hard Jason fans wanted: Jason doing the killings we love through all the movie, with the occasional sex scenes, gore!, and a brutal Jason. Kane Hodder is excellent as always. This may be his best performance as Jason. The effects are cheap but weren't needed at all, the gore played the important part this time. SPOILERS Some deaths are high class, like  when Jason smashes the frozen woman's head. Bloody brilliant!.But the best scene in the movie is the Camp Crystal Lake retro V.R. This scene is pure gold in the series! It's a historical moment in the series, Camp Crystal Lake featured in the year 2001. And even better, Jason doing one of his classic kills! As in part VII Jason smashes repeteadly to a tree a teen girl inside a sleepingbag. Brutal as ever. This may be not important to everyone, but the fans find it amazing.\nJason's demise in this movie  has to be the least liked in the series, although he's beaten by a strong man. At least this scene is better than the painfully to watch end in Part VIII. JASON X is dedicated only to FRIDAY THE 13th fans. If you don't like it, don't watch it. It's not meant for horror fans in general. In the Friday the 13th scale: 7/10.",

The first was \"Critters IV: They're invading our space.\" That one almost made sense, since the critters came from space to start with. And you get to see Angela Basset naked. Or her body double, anyway. Then you had Hellraiser IV: Bloodline, which ended with trapping Pinhead in a dimension where he could only phone it in for direct to DVD sequels. That was followed by \"Leprechaun in Space\", a movie where I think halfway through, they decided, \"Let's make this a farce, no one is taking this seriously, why should we?\" The idea is you put the monster in space, and watch him reenact the alien movies.Well, sadly, this was the end they intended to put poor Jason to. They had him get cryogenically frozen and then resurrected on a spaceship, along with Lexa Doig of Andromeda fame. (In a role reversal,Andromeda co-star Lisa Ryder plays an android, and a better one than Doig played on the series. Probably didn't do the casting right.) Of course, Jason comes back from the dead, and starts picking off horny undergrads and space marines. He is apparently killed (right, like that hasn't happened before) but resurrected with the help of nanobots into \"Super-Jason\".And why would a science ship have giant drill bits sticking straight up to impale star marines on? It boggles the mind.",

            "content": "The plot Finally captured in the year 2008, Jason Voorhees (Kane Hodder) is held inside a government research facility whose scientists try to answer the question that keeps eluding them - why one of the most infamous mass murderers in history cannot die. Once Rowan (Lexa Doig), leader of the research project, prepares the specimen for cryogenic suspension, a greedy scientist goes over her head and comes to remove Jason, only to have the mad slasher break free and slaughter him and his entire entourage. Tricking Jason into following her, Rowan eludes him into entering the cryogenic freezer and begins the process, but a breach in the system causes her to freeze with him. The government tries to deny any evidence of the project, and nearly four centuries pass, during which the Earth gradually becomes less and less habitable and humans have relocated to a planet in another star system that they've named Earth II. A team of young students descends onto the ruined Earth, where they find the frozen bodies of Jason and Rowan in the forgotten research facility and take back on board their ship with them. Rowan is thawed and revived, but the team mistakes Jason to be dead, having no idea of his abilities or motives. Before long, Jason awakens to the sound of young people having premarital sex once again, and the carnage erupts once again as the ship proceeds to Earth II. The remaining survivors fight for their lives as the centuries-old mad slasher proves that he is just as evil and just as indestructible during their time as he was centuries before.I have seem this movie a few times now, I really liked It the first time saw but every time I see it always find something new i don't like about this movie.The last time we saw Jason he was going to hell and then the next thing we see him being chained up somewhere, I need to ask this How the hell did he get out of Hell ?.I saw this again last night, for some reason I find it really boring and it was hard for me to try stay awake.Jason going to space was not a good idea at all and Jason getting upgrade was such a really bad idea. i hated that turned him into some robot. he was not the Jason we all knew or have been scared of before.The acting wasn't half that bad and there were only one or two good deaths scenes this movie.i going give this movie 4 out 10",

            "content": "Silly, juvenile, but admittedly fun- Jason X never really decides whether it wants to be a parody or actually take it seriously, but there is some entertaining moments along the way. First thing first, I don't like this movie, and there are certainly quite a few reasons why. First off, the majority of the acting is pretty horrible, with Lisa Ryder being the only halfway decent actress throughout the whole film. The set looks cheaply made, like a bunch of rejected sets of an early 2000's sci-fi film that was never made. The CGI can be quite obvious at times, although it isn't horrible, despite it sticking out so much. Some of the dialogue is super ridiculous, and in general the film is poorly written with some things clearly showing this film was made in 2001 and not 4 centuries in the future. Despite all that though, this film is surprisingly fun to watch, and is quite possibly one of the most entertaining entries in the franchise as a whole. Its kills can be fun from time to time, its setting and technology somewhat interesting, and its goofy antics are obviously stupid, but quite enjoyable to see play out on screen. In the end, Jason X was not nearly as bad as I thought it may be, although it certainly isn't in any way a good film. Maybe its unneeded, maybe its dumb and childish, but it certainly isn't the worst film ever made, nor the worst in the franchise.My Rating: 4.8/10.",

            "content": "So this was probably more fun than part 9 but it feels even more weaker in tone and further removed from what Jason's supposed to be about to me, as godawful and bizarre as Jason Goes to Hell was, it still barely and just about felt like a Friday movie. This never really does, apart from that one funny scene with the old school Crystal Lake hologram. The overall experience and quality of this flick right from the get go is that of an especially poor episode of some crappy science fiction show. It has a very noticeably cheap direct to video feel and aesthetic to it, the bad kind of direct to video, and it's not much more fun to watch than your average sci-fi channel original, Jason or not. I suppose it must be a lot more fun if you take on board that it isn't meant to be taken seriously, but that can only go so far, and the movie being aware of how lousy it was really didn't add anything help, because it really isn't smart enough of a movie to really do anything with it! It may have been stupid on purpose, but of me it was still pretty dang stupid and lame anyway, it couldn't even get that right!! While the awesome classic that is part 6 did show that a little well-placed wry humour could go a long way, this goes overboard with it, and it's hackneyed attempts at self-deprecation come off as obnoxious. The 'music' was really bad as well, abysmally bad, cheap tacky-ass excuse for a music score, there's no finesse to it, it just loudly blurts out whenever something happens and there are no slower menacing themes to go along with the nonexistent atmosphere, I couldn't believe it was by the same composer as the original. One of the few things that makes it worth watching is of course Kane Hodder, although all but one of the kills are weak or worse lazy cutaways, he still brought his very distinctive air of intimidation and lethalness to his movements and he was always fun to watch as the character. I didn't really care for Jason's design however, it's not nearly one of his best, he's supposed to be a rotten zombie from hell at this point, so why does he have silly tufts of hair? And the head is too big, and the mecha-Jason is cool and all but he does virtually besides break down a few doors, he looks like an action figure! I love Lisa Ryder's character of the perky android, her super upbeat attitude and over the top delivery fit right into the world of the movie and I thought the best part was when she kicks Jason's ass and blows him to bits when she brought out the big guns! The movie just overall never really did it for me that much, because it's so far removed from the simple but solid magic that these films had in their eighties heydays. Thank goodness Freddy Vs Jason gave the undead slasher a little more dignity than this effort did. Space is truly where the long running horror movie franchises go to die! It is somewhat entertaining and enjoyable and it's absolutely nothing like the other movies in the series and to be fair isn't totally without a certain tacky charm, but as a Friday the 13th movie it's definitely one of the worst ever, there's too much silly annoying humour and the terrible production values bring it way down, and perhaps worst of all it's downright forgettable, can't say that about most of the other movies.. I believe I'll take creepy dark woods Jason over this any day! X.",

So taking a cryogenically frozen Jason and putting him 400 years in the future in outer space is not the worst idea out there. I actually thought that could be a good premise to a tired franchise. Jason X has a lot of problems and is a mixed bag that ultimately is guilty pleasure viewing. I do enjoy this for a laugh, but it could have been legitimately good if it was taken more seriously. The writing, dialogue and acting is really bad, with a mostly clueless young cast that could have been on Dawson's Creek or something. It does what most science fiction does and rips off Star Trek. The tone is really silly and tongue in cheek. However, Kane Hodder is as great here as our hero Jason and he is as menacing as ever. The money from the film obviously went into special f/x and cinematography. Jason X really looks great, but with a flimsy plot and goofy acting the film falls flat on it's face. But if that was tightened up, Jason X could have gone the distance. That having been said, I enjoy Jason X and Freddy Vs Jason much better than the other films in the series.",

The two are found by a space crew made up of a greedy captain and inexperienced hot science professors.  When they melt the bodies(including Jason those morons!) Jason is out on a killing spree on this ship.Like in all movies of the series, this movie has awful acting, tons of gore, and hot young teenagers.  This movie may seem like the best one of the series but it should not take any pride in it. The only noteworthy thing about watching this awful movie is that it is noted as the horror movie with the most amount of murders. It's true but they went over the limit; at least 1 person was attacked or killed every minute in the stupidest way. Also, may I note that this movie is supposed to be a horror, but when I am watching this I sometimes think they tried to make this film a comedy. Not a good combination. Anyway, for the die hard Jason fans, go see it. For the average movie-goer, you can skip it no big deal. 3 stars out of 10.",

I will say this,it will be a hell of a lot better than Halloween Resurrection.If you've seen the trailer for it, this film takes itselfway too seriously. For crying out loud, how many times can Michael Myers come back in a serious and scary fashion? The producing team for Halloween should take notes from Jason X: you've made far too many sequels up to this point, so you might as well have a little fun with it.I will also say this: David Cronenberg's cameo performance was pretty cool, and Lexa Doig was ravishing.",

Ooh, I know... Jason onboard a ship!\" \"Hello? JASON TAKES MANHATTAN?!\" \"No, no... a SPACE ship!\" \"WE LOVE IT... here's $10 Million!!!\" So, in a half-cocked, hair-brained plot device, Jason winds up on a space ship several centuries in the future. And he pretty much does what he's always done. Stalking around and killing people. There are absolutely no interesting characters. The dialogue is eye-rolling atrocious. And it all feels so shoddy. Like an early episode of STAR TREK, but without the camp quality. There is one cool thing about this one however, Jason gets a solid metal mask!

As usual there was a fair amount of gore and teenage lust but the script has some, without trying to sound clich\u00e9d, killer jokes. The acting left a lot to be desired but this has come to be expected with this particular slasher series. The story is based around the context that Jason has been frozen in cryogenic stasis while the world around him has fallen to pieces and mankind has deserted the earth. That of course doesn't stop some meddling students on an interstellar field trip finding and defrosting him. Great idea kids! The result is a fiendishly funny and not entirely unscary film. It has its moments of corny dialogue (man falls on top of giant screw and twists down it - \"he's screwed\" is the line) but this is offset by some laugh out loud jokes. One especially good one is near the end so hang around even if your not enjoying it.

The Jason Vorhees movies continue not because they're good, but because they are a tried and tested formula - blood, mayhem and gore. There's no deep meaning here. It's just more of the same.If you go into this movie expecting anything other than silliness and blood-splattering, you'll hate it. On the other hand if, like me, you expected it to be diabolically bad, then you'll be pleasantly surprised.Of course it's throw-away rubbish, but it knows it's crap, and pokes fun at itself. And for that reason it's a good film to sit down in front of and switch off your brain for a bit and have a laugh.Apart from the original movie I can only recall seeing part of one of the intervening series of films - some nonsense with Jason on a boat. So I can't comment on whether it's better or worse than the others. Even my memory of the original is hazy now. But this episode is not too bad.The best bit is the android girl who gets \"reprogrammed\" by her creator/would-be-lover into a killing machine. Up to that point she was mildly uninteresting, as all the characters are. After that, I was rooting for her the rest of the film. The others are fairly bland and die in an assortment of ways, some more amusing than others.There's some hokum about how Jason keeps going and why he regenerates etc. but it's just added fluff to the carnage. There's also the obligatory sexual scene, but it's tame and light.Not very good, but for a tenth movie of a franchise, it holds up quite well.",

As one reviewer so aptly commented, Jason X is to the FRIDAY 13TH franchise what BRIDE OF CHUCKY was to the CHUCKY series! OK...granted - this was no masterpiece but hey, for any serious devotee of the Jason culture - this offers so much! terrific one-liners, a marvellous virtual Camp Crystal Lake sequence and with Kane Hodder behind the mask - the definitive Jason! (His fourth outing I believe!) Jason in space is no dumber than his last re-invention....as an alien parasite in JASON GOES TO HELL: THE FINAL FRIDAY - and ludicrous and misplaced as THAT was...I was entertained!JASON X was originally conceived as a JASON vs FREDDIE slasher epic, but somewhere in the legal logistics they couldn't get their act together and thus Jason found himself alone in a cryogenic chamber and ultimately helming his own little blood-letting space odyssey! If you have any awareness at all, you will get a lot out of this film - don't look at it on the surface...that was never the makers' intent!I was bitterly disappointed to have to watch this tenth outing..more than one year late in its Australian release, in the company of less than 5 people recently! The film had NO advance publicity, no critical coverage and basically no media advertising of any description! Its \"failure\" was carefully orchestrated. Got news for you people, they've been trying to \"kill off Jason\" for almost a generation...its gonna take more than your contribution, believe me.  Jason will ALWAYS live!",

(Think \"Freddy\" & Chucky\"... ) So comes 'Jason X'; and it's clear from the start that there's nothing at all here that was meant to be taken seriously. This is an episode definitely NOT above chucking in liberal doses of humour to go along with the required entrails and thus hopefully swell the studio coffers. You know what? I prefer it this way, too! Staunch devotees may find themselves disagreeing with me, but this is a welcome new direction for Mr. Voorhees; and the knowing chuckles combined with lots and lots of blood turn what could have been yet another painful slog into a fun send-up of horror clich\u00e9s past - and indeed, tired plot-elements in general...I'd rather they go for the funny-bone where the Fridays are concerned; since I can't honestly say I had all that much affection for them in the first place; unlike in the cases of Child's Play and A Nightmare on Elm Street. It's been proved that the former AND the latter are perfectly suited to 'seriousness'; whereas I've ALWAYS struggled to take Jason seriously as anything more than a cheap Michael Myers knockoff, right from the start - so this could be his 'niche'... !!! The movie finds time to use its future setting cleverly; exploiting the possibilities both for elaborate deaths, and indeed, the 'post-modern wit' earlier described... A clever use of virtual-reality in particular to ensnare Jason provides a fun projection of how people might look back on the saga as a whole, in our OWN distant future! The props may have gone a little more 'space-age' (if perhaps, no less 'cheap-looking'... !) but it's nice to see that underneath the new exterior there is still retained a certain element of people lurking behind props in the haunted house, waiting to go \"Boo\"... ! 'Terror' is quite a simple reflex-mechanism to engender, if you think about it; and most of the old values are happily not lost, even though the surroundings were deemed in need of an 'upgrade'...Judging on \"Resurrection\", the 'Halloween' series ought to think seriously about the option of gravitating toward INTENTIONAL laughs, too... Yes, this film features pretty amateur surgeons in sheer cutoff tops; but what the heck is wrong with that, when the dominant tone is one of tongue-in-cheek spoofery???! Traversing the comedic route has effectively resuscitated this series more effectively than a bolt of lightning EVER did... If people can't hear you 'scream' in space, they might be able to hear you chortle, at least... ! (Yes, there are SEVERAL references to the 'Alien' franchise in the actual movie, as well!)",

What made me mad was that these ants enhanced Jason but they didn't repair any of Jason's victims.  What's up with THAT?  That infuriated me!  So many plot holes.  Why are their nothing but American Pie hot chicks on this \"space ship\"?  That was lame.  Even the band girl from American Pie was in this movie.  Her death was the grossest.  She was sucked through a vent due to a hole in the spaceship that made all the air go out into space.  There were other gross killings.  One guy was impaled on a screw (giant).  When one of crew asks what this guys condition is, the reply is \"he's screwed\". How NOT funny.  There was even an ANDROID that somehow manages to do the MOST damage to Jason.  This ANDROID was kind of like DATA!!  She yearned to \"become human.\"  Can you say, RIP OFF OF STAR TREK!?  Of course, there is the tough black sergeant who resembles the Candyman.  He's all tough and says some really stupid lines.  I hated this movie.  What made it worse was that everybody in the theater was hysterically laughing.  That's BAD MOVIE EDIKIT!

I just thought I might take it as a comedy and that way it could be entertaining. I was so wrong. Jason X is a horrible movie and it\u00b4s not even scary. You know those Teletubbies? Now those guys are really scary! In one of my nightmares I run into them on a dark street and then I wake up screaming. But this Jason Voorhees does nothing to me. A 5-year old kid would be scared of him, but come on, the whole Jason myth is just plain stupid. How many times has he been killed? Some weirdos seem to get their kicks watching Jason slaughtering young people, but any normal human being should find it sick. The whole Friday the 13th series just shows that all that the film makers want is just money from the freak fans who obviously exist. I believe this was the 10th movie in the series and I\u00b4ve read that all the parts are all the same: Jason somehow comes back to life and starts killing. This just goes out to prove the stupidity of people and film makers.Jason X should be buried as deep as possible and left there. On the other hand the movie is such waste that it  might not even decay. Still, it\u00b4s our job to take care of the garbage so that the next generations don\u00b4t have to suffer the way we did.As a final note I\u00b4d like to say that someone please kill that goddamn Jason or put all the film makers responsible behind the bars.",

They are discovered 455 years in the future by a science-teaching-kind-of-spaceship, and jetted off into space. (The Earth is a desolate wasteland, so clearly we didn't recycle enough.) They revive the woman, but assume Jason is dead and just poke him with sharp things and cut off his mask. Big mistake.Jason revives and starts killing scantily-clad space students. The marines are sent in to get him, and this briefly becomes an Alien-with-Jason flick. He dispatches them all and the remaining students, their teacher, the woman from the past, a surviving marine and a Ninja-S&M robot have to take him on.I thought this was going to be awful, and the first act kind of confirmed that. Although David Cronenberg pops up and gets killed by Jason (truly a horror hall of fame moment), most of what happens is a bit stilted and the effects are awful. But once Jason dispatches the marines and the real plot kicks in, this really one of the best films in this series. It manages to fulfill the formulaic expectations you have for the series while injecting some fresh elements and being genuinely funny at times. It also has some of the more inventively gory kills in the series (a special call out to the guy impaled on a giant screw that lazily keeps spinning and drifts all the way down).This film has a souped-up nanobot powered cyber Jason in the last act.Jason is distracted by a hologram projection of two topless camper chicks in sleeping bags.Yes.",

A lot of people I spoke to criticized the film being set in space but did we really want to see another film set in Crystal Lake?I liked the performances throughout and it was great to see Lisa Ryder and Lexa Doig (from Andromeda)together again. Ryder played Kay-Em 14 who was an android and she came out with some good lines. The film itself was quite comedic at times but that's not a bad thing.Mustn't forget the star of the show-Jason. Kane Hodder plays Jason again and once again does a brilliant job of making Jason Voorhees menacing.The killings are quite bizarre at times. I won't go into detail but they are quite strange especially Jason's first victim when he wakes up on the spaceship.All in all, Jason X was a great film in which the unstoppable killer hacked his way through victim after victim.

I really didn't see much point in setting the movie 500 years in the future. Really, even with the decent sci-fi special effects, Jason X is a re-hash of every other Friday the 13th film. It doesn't capitalize upon its backdrop. In the end, the time period is little more than a gimmick.\nThe audience is promised something new and special. However, the flick doesn't deliver the goods. Instead of a fresh spin upon the series (think Wes Craven's New Nightmare or Bride of Chucky) Jason X is Friday the 13th parts 3,4,5,6 and Jason Goes to New York rolled into one movie.\nThe picture name drops and hints at other genre pictures (the likes of Alien and Solaris are referenced). Still, is that really all that clever?\nFurthermore, the cast is loaded with aspiring young mannequins who fail to breath the smallest amount of life into the underwritten roles. Truthfully, halfway through Jason X, I could not even remember the names of the victims-in-waiting. Okay, I know that people go to these movies for the high body count. To be sure, Jason X delivers in this area. Well over 20 people meet their timely deaths in this film. Still, so many characters are sliced and diced, the proceedings become tedious after about 12 minutes. One scene places Jason inside a virtual reality simulation of Camp Crytal Lake, circa 1980. Finally (three quarters of the way through!!!) Jason X shows a genuine sense of humor. If the rest of the movie displayed the same spirit, it would be a winner.

            "content": "When a film series hits ten sequels, you know that the writing staff are just trying to hold onto any kind of meal ticket they possibly can, sure that nothing else they put together will bring home the bacon. After all, who can honestly look me in the eye and say that the tenth James Bond film (or any episode featuring Roger Moore) was anything other than an expensive stream of fire-lighters?It seems there are two schools of thought about Jason X as a result. There are the hardcore fans who seem to think that using the same basic plot over and over and over is a good thing despite the fact that this episode outgrossed its three most immediate predecessors put together. Then there are the people who have watched more than two dozen films in their lifetime, and are ready to recognise that sometimes a little variety is a good thing.Jason X distinguishes itself from the previous eight rehashes by adding a very basic, superficial sci-fi setting. This is the first good move, as one critic I normally violently disagree with has described the other eight films as \"the ultimate in recycling - so much so that you forget which episode you are watching after a while\". At least there is little chance of mistaking Jason X for episodes one through nine. There is also the element of digital photography. I would have loved to have seen this film theatrically, especially after the grainy, out of focus crap that George Lucas proclaimed as the future with his digital Star Wars. It would have been nice to see if digital photography truly is capable of delivering what its proponents claim. If the DVD-Video of Jason X is anything to go by, then George Lucas should be informed that he is doing more to hurt the digital revolution than help it.Anyway, I am not going to comment on the plot, since it has been done to death, and it appears that the American Butcher's Association has once again failed to recognise that adults watch films, too. The DVD-Video sold in Australia runs almost as long as the IMDB-quoted theatrical running time, which means that at least three and a half minutes of footage that was deleted from the USA theatrical exhibition is present on Australian home videos. About the only complaint that I have here is the Kay-Em droid, who really does more to annoy the audience and ruin the experience than add to anyone's enjoyment. Kane Hodder is in great form as the hockey-masked killer, however. Unlike the majority of people who have played Jason in the past, Hodder really looks the part of a demented woodsman who has grown up totally cut off from civilisation. Anyone who has any doubts about that should take a good look at some of the frontal shots of Uber-Jason. That guy really must have eaten his Wheaties as a boy. Such a pity that the MPAA butchered his first two appearances as Jason beyond recognition (a fact that is hilariously referenced in the illusion-campsite scene).In all, if you are into films, and not circular rehashes of the same old tired plot ad nauseum, then Jason X is for you. It's not the most creative thing you'll ever see, and it's not the best horror film on Earth, but the mere fact that they were brave enough to do something different and have a little bit of fun with it elevates the tenth Friday The 13th far above eight of its nine predecessors. I can see why they dumped the FT13 moniker, quite frankly.",

            "content": "*SOME SPOILERS AHEAD*I'm glad James Isaac, the director, decided to return to the B-movie formula after the disappointing \"Jason Goes to Hell,\" which was simply a failed A-movie effort.  Now, the acting, storyline and dialogue are definitely in perfect B-movie tradition, but the directing and production design were quite impressive.  I loved the color schemes and use of the digital camera, which was then transferred onto film.  I loved the digital look of the film, it's almost flawless.  And though the special f/x were obviously generated by computers, they also looked pretty cool.  OK, so we got ourselves another screwy idea of how to bring Jason back to life, but heck...we love Jason so much that we can't stand to see him go. What makes \"Jason X\" so much fun to watch is that there's no pretentions. This is pure camp and doesn't try to be any more than pure camp, and it simply takes the genre of camp slasher flick and runs with it as far as it can.  This tenth (I'm not quite sure if I can call it the final) chapter contains a lot more humor than the previous sequels.  Most of the sequels did contain a certain degree of humor, but this one takes the cake.  There are many funny scenes and lines of dialogue, including one where one of the female victims is about to die and her last words are \"This sucks on so many levels.\"  Another funny line occurs when the big black guy got stabbed in the ribs by Jason.  He says, \"It'll take more than a poke in the ribs to kill me.\"  After Jason stabs him again, he says, \"That'll do.\"  You can call this movie weird, you can call it insane, but you gotta give it points for originality.  Of course, in great B-movie tradition, all the female characters look like they leaped straight out of the pages of \"Playboy\" or \"Penthouse.\"  Even the scientist, who gets frozen along with Jason, is hot as hell.  Though most of these chicks don't get naked, at least they run around in tight, skimpy clothing.  As I've said in past reviews, most of the people watching these flicks are guys, so you may as well appeal to the general demographic.  I just wish that gloriously hot blonde chick in the beginning didn't get killed off so early and died of such ugly death--her face frozen and smashed into pieces.  As far as the nudity factor goes, at least I got my wish at the near end of the film, when those two hot babes stripped off their tops. It kinda sucks that there was only brief nudity, but it's definitely a scene worth fast-forwarding to and rewinding over and over again. \nThe most entertaining scene in the movie is when the victims are all cornered by Jason and don't know what the hell to do, until the robotic woman pops up like a warrior, in a scant leather outfit, holding a machine gun.  You can't help but cheer on the top of your lungs when that scene comes up.  If you're a movie critic, you can pick apart this movie in many ways, but its flaws are what charmed me about the film.  The acting is bad, but it was bad to the extent where it made me smile (rather than cringe).  The dialogue is also bad, but it made me laugh, and it sort of parodies the cheesy lines we hear in many trashy horror flicks.  Cool death scenes, hot chicks, great moments of humor, one great nude scene. What more can I ask for?  I'm not quite sure, but I felt the movie was missing something, which prevented it from making it any more than a slightly above-average film--at least in my opinion.  There was a certain aura of dullness to it, though I still had a good deal of fun. Nevertheless, it's definitely worth watching and worth renting on DVD (there's a great commentary and a great documentary about the Jason flicks). You pretty much have nothing to lose.  But I really wish they could've played \"Let the Bodies Hit the Floor\" somewhere in the film, because it sounded awesome in the trailer.  Once again, I must say:  Stop playing music in trailers if it's not gonna be in the film!  My score:  6 (out of 10)",

So, Jason continues to sit in creative limbo here in the 21st century, until that all gets figured out. So, getting back to this film, New Line Cinema brought Jason back, completely ignoring their plotline from the previous film, Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday (1993) and try to pull off a reboot, of sorts.It has been eight years since we last saw Jason Vorhees in the theaters. A lot may have happened to him, off camera, since the last film. The events in this film happen after the year 2008, then we jump 450 years into the future. We start up in the beginning of this film, where Jason is shackled away in a Crystal Lake Research Facility (boy Crystal Lake has grown a lot since 1979). Scientist realize he can't be killed. His recuperative abilities are a mystery. He is slated for cryogenic suspension, in order to get rid of him forever. He doesn't seem to be the worse for wear. He's not even his old disfigured self anymore either. He has his hockey mask back too.A horrible group of characters inhabit the futuristic research vessel, that Jason ends up on. What is really hilarious about the whole set-up, are half of the crew look like teenage camp counselors. That is the producers of the film, sticking to a Jason Vorhees staple. All the characters deliver bad dialogue and silly one-liners. There is nothing but tired plot scenarios and scenes that are not needed. There is one funny scene, in which Jason meets two women in a camp site hologram. The science fiction part of the plot, totally gives off a Star Trek vibe. This is definitely Jason's biggest death toll in one of his films.On the good side, Jason X (2001), does however, have that feeling of being like an old Roger Corman, science fiction movie from the 1970s. That doesn't save it from being a joke however. The plot gets a little tiring and the end seems to never come. Jason just keeps coming back for more, as a grade D, Star Trek episode, unfolds in front of us. Jason's essence even takes over the ship's computer in a ridiculous plot-twist. Eventually, the story goes from Star Trek to Space Balls. It just feels a little bit too comic-bookish. I wanted to put this film on my Unwatchable List, but you have to see this film to believe it. The film is still a failure, but I still think it was a brave attempt to take a tired IP and try to do something different with it. You also are treated to a David Cronenberg sighting. The legendary science fiction/horror director, plays the role of Dr. Wimmer. That's worth it I think.3.3 (F- MyGrade) = 4 IMDB.",

            "content": "SPOILERSOnce upon a time there was a group of classic horror films which brought the genre back to the masses. With films like \"A Nightmare On Elm Street\", \"Halloween\" and \"Friday The 13th\" we were given some dark, slightly scary films which were based on the art of disturbing the audience and giving them nightmares. Eventually however, these series degraded into films where the established main characters would not be scary, but they'd kill larger numbers of people in much more extreme ways. This new take on the idea might not have been as intelligent an idea, but with films like \"Jason X\", they were incredibly entertaining and definitely worth a look.Set in the 25th century, Jason Voorhees has been cryogenically frozen and resurrected in the future. Faced with a fresh group of teenagers and money grabbing adults, Voorhees will once again grab his machete and create carnage.Basically this film is a simple opportunity to grab Mr Voorhees and place him in space. Any sort of surrounding plot is irrelevant and rather pointless. Despite being 500 years in the future, the teenagers continue to be sex obsessed, playful and one remains stoned. The only real difference between future teenagers and ones from previous modern films is that they are now living in space and don't understand certain phrases. In effect, there is nothing new to this film, but there's no reason why we shouldn't enjoy it.\"Jason X\" is your typical violent, gore filled story and is ridiculously daft as well. With absolutely no plot, the idea of this film is that it's so that Voorhees can travel around and cut people up in extreme ways. It's not a decent story and it's not clever, but \"Jason X\" is still ridiculously entertaining. With some extreme deaths and some cracking lines, this film is just good fun. Watching Jason killing people should never be entertaining, but it just really works. It's not brilliant, but ultimately who cares, it's just a good laugh.",

Now, after learning this, I was beginning to wonder if I should really watch the film. Because, films with that high of a body count, are usually pretty bad. Like the horrid, HALLOWEEN: THE CURSE OF MICHAEL MYERS where the killer just goes around killing people for no apparant reason. Now, I understand that that is what Jason is made to do. It's like his job. So, I understood this and took it into consideration while I was watching.\nJASON X is a continuous murder fest. Which is good if you like people getting butchered every two seconds. I don't think there is a scene in this film where someone is not either getting killed or getting attacked. Most members of the cast are unknown, and a campy horror film of this sort usually has a heavy metal soundtrack, but I was disappointed to find out otherwise.

Jason is found frozen as is Rowan (Lexa Doig), they bring both back to life and before you know it Jason is killing dafties by the score. Rowan warns the staff on the ship about Jason, but she'd have been better speaking in Serbo-Croat because Professor Lowe is only interested in the money he'll receive for bringing Jason back to his employees, alas he'll not be seeing any money as he's soon bumped off along with most of the tough marine types. This leaves only Rowan, some students, Tsunaron and his modifies android Kay-Em 14 ( Lisa Ryder).Kay-Em is probably the best character in the movie, followed by the feisty Janessa (Melyssa Ade) and Tsunaron (Chuch Campbell). Some great thrills in the film especially with Uber Kay-Em and Uber Jason, and plenty of gory deaths. But this is more of a SciFI movie than a stand alone horror film, and is all the better for it.

The special effects while dated by today's standards were actually pretty decent for a low budget slasher movie made in the early 2000s.The idea of putting Jason Voorhees in space is as crazy and silly as it sounds. This is probably the least serious entry in the Friday the 13th series to date and that's in a movie series that has had some very odd entry's which have included a copycat Jason Voorhees killer, followed by the resurrection of Jason that essentially made him an unkillable zombie, then a movie where Jason fights a girl with telekinetic powers, then Jason went to Manhattan where toxic waste turned him back into a child which was ignored in the next movie where Jason dies but comes back once again as a body snatcher creature which ends with him being sent to hell with Freddy Kreuger, after all that it's no surprise Jason went to space it's the next logical step in a series as crazy as this one.Jason X was released in 2001 but was actually filmed in 1999 and was first released in Germany in the year 2000 before it was finally released in the US in 2001. The movie was made during the Matrix craze era of the early 2000s when every movie was trying to get in on the science fiction craze brought about by the success of The Matrix.I recommend Jason X if your a fan of old school slasher movies that focus more on the death scenes and special effects it's fun, bloody and entertaining like a Jason movie should be.",

But I've got to say it wasn't nearly as bad as most of the previous Friday the 13th films.  This one at least has some originality to it.  I agree is was a bit of a stretch to have Jason Vorhees in space, but at least it opened some doors for some interesting and futuristic deaths, weapons, characters and what not.  I can't believe people would say this one was worse than the previous 7 films, they're all just different ways of telling the same story and virtually nothing new to look at!  At least this one was an interesting change of scenery.The acting was nothing to get excited about, but c'mon, it's the 10th movie in a horror series, what can you expect?  Besides, the movie doesn't require good acting, I'm not watching this film for acting talent.On the upside, the women in the film were very good looking.  Virtually every female in the cast was very attractive and quite nice on the eyes.Also, a lot of people said that the special effects weren't very good.  Well no, they aren't very good compared to \"The Matrix\" or \"Jurassic Park\", but for a Jason film, they were pretty darn good.  I was personally very impressed with the special effects, I'm sure the budget was pretty small for this film and somehow they pulled off some pretty good special effects. Also, before I forget, I really liked the opening title sequence in the film.  Very well done (MUCH better than ANY of the previous Friday the 13th films).The dialogue in the film was really bad, with a number of moments that just make you want to cringe because you can't believe how stupid the lines are.The whole Uber-Jason thing was stupid as all hell!  Why did they do that? Ok, I can understand the machine that fixes humans actually putting Jason back together, but why would it make him better than before?  And why, oh why, would it create a new hockey mask for him and make his whole right side out of metal?  I cannot even begin to express how stupid that is!  That aside...the make up effects were actually pretty impressive and well done.No, I wouldn't recommend this film to just anyone, but if you are a Jason fan, go ahead and watch it.  ...And if you are just a mediocre Jason fan and a sci-fi fan, then go ahead and check this one out.  In all honesty, you don't need to watch any of the previous films to understand what's going on here (it might even be better if you don't).  Although, it might be nice to watch the first two films, and they may shed some light on subject.  If, you do choose to see this film, I hope you enjoy it.  Thanks for reading,-Chris",

So, 25th century has the people living on Earth 2, but a single greedy doctor's and his uncannily 20th-century-alike flock of students exploration ship has just picked up a valuable relic on Earth 1. Guess one time. The plot is essentialy \"Alien\", just replace the xenomorph with Jason. Most of \"Jason X\" is what you would expect, a loud, glorious, stoopid mess, full of shiny and uninspired sets, completed with digital violence taking over practical effects, and a costume design that raises eyebrows. Protagonist characters are very clich\u00e9, not the smartest bunch and are very expendable, which Jason continuously makes sure of. My biggest complaint, really, is not enough diversity in the kills and gore section, or the stuff that could compensate for the overall silliness. Other than that, \"Jason X\" is a reasonably self-aware flick that spends almost all of its time racking up body count, sometimes so monotonously that boredom is born. Here and there a joke is inserted. A spoof on the franchise itself, the entire slasher genre? Maybe, but what does it change. If nothing else, it's at least entertaining. 4/10.",

I have heard lots of critics that HAVEN'T EVEN WATCHED THE MOVIE bash the film, I will have to admit, I don't see why New Line would have Jason go to hell one installment and never explain how Jason comes back the next.Jason X is funny, exciting, and action-packed; however, it is NOT intended to be scary, but any fan of Jason knows this.  Friday the 13th and Jason films were never intended to be scary, but they were intended to be what it has been doing for 22 years, a good summer slasher film.I do have to question the Jason franchise, you have said that he died twice, but it seems that he just comes back.  I know in the sixth installment we find out how he does come back, but in Jason X, we never know how he comes back, he just comes back.  Funny how the devil doesn't want Jason around.If you're a fan of slasher films, you'll love it; if you're a Jason fan, you'll REALLY love it, if you're looking for a good film to spend some money on, you MAY like it, but one thing is for sure, you will walk out of the theater saying one word.

            "content": "Roger Ebert in reviewing Master of Disguise described the film as `a party guest who thinks he's funny, but isn't and you just want him to go away.' That pretty much sums up my feelings on Jason X quite nicely.  It tries to be suspenseful in places, and isn't.  It tries to be funny, and fails. If they tried to make it scary, God did they ever fail.  They tried to make it cheesy, and God did they ever succeed.Like Friday the 13th VI: Jason lives, Jason X doesn't quite capture the blend of horror with comedy that other successful franchises have so classically attained.  Friday 13's humor always comes across as pointless extras that are severely out of place, or in other words, they don't know how to capture humor effectively while trying to maintain a horror atmosphere.  (Here's a Hint, guys: Talk to Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell.)At least Jim Isaac and Tod Farmer (director & writer) tried to do something new with the dead formula (much like the makers of Jason Goes to Hell tried to do something new).  Like its predecessor, this entry attempts to combine multiple sci-fi genres, comic books heroes/villains, and change up the setting, and they take it a step further by giving Jason a new look. Guess what?  They fail on everything except the new look for Jason (too bad it's a new stupid look.)  I guess I'm not surprised since I didn't feel the original succeeded on anything other than making money, and if the so called 'original and best' in the series doesn't fair so well, then how can something derivative from it succeed?On a positive note, I'm happy to say after nine entries, veteran Friday the 13th composer Harry Manfridini created a score I actually enjoyed listening to while watching.  Granted, I'm not going to rush out and buy the thing any time soon, but it did not make me cringe and reach for the mute button like another entry . . .  Jason Lives.",

But since part 8, they have strayed from the format thinking it will work.  They are now 0 for 3.They stuck Jason on a boat.  Lousy.  They had his spirit body-hop.  Lousy. Now they stick him in the future up in space.  Lousy.  He and a crusader against him are frozen in time cryogenically and thawed out 400 some-odd years later.  The beginning time listed in the film is 2010.  Seeing how many times the release of the film was pushed back, maybe the filmmakers new how bad it was and anticipated a shelflife of several years.  Anyway, in 2455, a research-space crew discover the two human popsicles.  They thaw out the hot chick and think Jason is a lost cause.  But up he pops to start a standard mayhem.  Hey, ten films in and it gets hard to think up new ways to disect people.  They even brought back the writer of the original, Victor Miller, and not even he could come up with anything worthwhile 22 years later.  20 actually, according to the credits, this was completed in 2000 (remember how rushed these things were back in the 80s to make it to each summers slew of flicks?).  Here we get machete ad naseum, heads slammed about (something that really annoyed me in part 8) and, once again, the element that's bothered me about the last two films: tortuous deaths.  Big J used to pop out of the darkness and WAMMO you were dead.  A musical stinger, the audience jumps, and a quick flash of blood.  It was fun as hell.  Now, Jason drags his victims around or makes their deaths a lingering experience. The frozen face-smash was interesting, but mean-spirited.  Plus this thing goes on forever; lots of talk, and far too much money spent on the outer space effects.  Is this \"Star Wars\" or \"F13\"?  For a wonderfully fleeting moment things go back 20 years when Jason is \"taken\" back to Crystal Lake for a moment.  But it doesn't last, and they go for a stupid laugh as well. The ending is an endless barage of gunshot blasts, a lot coming from a cocky and very annoying android.  Then your usual set up for the next movie. Another disappointment is that they managed to get Manfredini back to do the music...and it's awful!  Only a few ch, ch, ch's and a lot of tv-movie type stuff (whistling flutes and dramatic build-ups).  Maybe by part 11 the music, the plot style, the murders, will finally revert back to the greatness of the earlier films.  And like a loyalist, I will be back as usual.",

            "content": "Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer showed there was new life in this sub-genre of horror, with their heroes and heroines a little smarter and wiser than the oversexed victims we saw in the first Friday the 13th and Halloween flicks. In fact, even the Halloween franchise got in on the post-modern act by having Jamie Lee Curtis return to face Michael Myers one last time in Halloween: H20 (well, until the forthcoming sequel, anyway.) So here we are in 2002 and now it's Jason's turn to get a reboot in Jason X, his tenth film and New Line Cinema's second with the character. I'll admit that I gave up watching Friday the 13th films after the third installment. I don't count myself as a big fan of this genre because I know Jason is gonna survive each film, no matter what happens. From speaking to friends and acquaintances who have seen all the Friday the 13th  movies out there, part of the appeal the Friday films offer to slasher fans is the fun in watching Jason off his prey in new and creative ways. For that reason alone fans of Jason will probably enjoy Jason X as it offers plenty of grisly kills that haven't been seen before. But does it offer anything else besides an impressive body count? After a cool opening credit sequence where the camera is inside Jason, we see the homicidal hockey mask wearing maniac has finally been captured and is being held in solitude. Rowan (Lexa Doig) doesn't want Dr. Wimmer to take Jason away from the secure facilities at the Crystal Lake Research Facility. Of course, Jason breaks free and offs everyone there except for our heroine who manages to freeze Jason (and herself) just before she has a date with the Grim Reaper. Time passes and 500 years later Earth is a forgotten wasteland. A group of visiting history students uncover the entombed Jason and Rowan, take them back into their spaceship and thaw them out. Now that the first act of the picture is out of the way, the carnage truly begins. As far as Friday the 13th films go, Jason X has some superior assets. The set design of the spaceship Grendel sure looks cool, and the visual FX by Toronto-based Toybox are pretty kick-ass all around (especially for one scene where soldiers play in a holodeck). The actors all do a good enough job given the material they're working with -- you know, have sex, scream, collect paycheck -- and the characters are likeable enough. Kane Hodder's Jason is, well, Jason and he does what one expects him to do when a big homicidal maniac wields a machete. Extra kudos are given to Lisa Ryder, who plays the android Kay-Em 14. Ryder's mechanical character comes across very different than her Andromeda starship captain role she's best known for, more subdued and likeable. I've read elsewhere that Jason X has by far the largest body count of any previous films, and that certainly gives an incentive for horror fans to go check it out. But... somewhere along the way I think Jason X veered left when it should have veered right. This should be a film that focused on capturing a wider audience, say people like me who fell away from the Friday the 13th series because, after awhile, every Friday movie seemed the same. While credit needs to be given to screenwriter Todd Farmer for going that extra step into the unknown and taking Jason off-planet and placing him into a sci-fi setting, I think Farmer needed to take the material that one extra and dangerous step further: into satire. Sam Raimi did this with Evil Dead II and the resulting fusion of horror and comedy paid off in a huge way. Evil Dead II is considered a classic by just about every horror fan, and I was hoping Jason X could utilize this approach to make Jason Voorhees' approach more appealing and less familiar. Farmer and director James Isaac try hamming it up in later scenes but by this time the tone of the movie has already been established, and the result are moments that should have been funny but instead you roll-your-eyes and groan out loud. Also following into the realm of missed opportunity was the chance to play with some sci-fi clich\u00e9s we've all seen since the first Friday the 13th film came out more than 20 years ago. There are some in the picture, like Rowan asking about \"beaming off\" the ship or the Aliens-like vibe coming from the Marines who are sent to hunt down Jason, but you're left wishing there were more of these, or better executed for more laughs. One stand-out example is the recreation of a Camp Crystal Lake hologram circa 1980 and Jason's interaction with it. Again, it works because it's played for the right amount of laughs and drama. The audience is already in on the joke; after nine films, we know what Jason's reaction would be but it's still fun to see it happen.When we're finally introduced to the new, upgraded Jason 2.0, there's surprisingly little of him in action before the film needs to be wrapped up. Of course, room for a sequel is left at the end of the film and it would be interesting to see where New Line decided to go in a future chapter.> Ultimately your mileage on Jason X will vary depending upon what you want to get out of it. If you're looking for a scary movie that winks at the audience a la Scream, you'll probably be disappointed. At the same time, die-hard fans will likely get more enjoyment from seeing the return of Jason and the new kills he notches along the way. And if you're someone like me who was hoping for more re-thinking of the entire franchise and the horror icon Jason Voorhees has become in the genre, you're split down the middle.As much as I dig that poster design and the concept of re-inventing this franchise and finding a way to appease the traditional Friday the 13th fan, Jason X remained a mixed bag for me.",

As I was looking for something to watch on Netflix, and this showed up. I hadn't seen this in forever. Since that previous viewing, I've seen many, many horror films... and many, many of them were terrible. \"Jason X\" stands alongside some of the worst I've seen. Not even 7 minutes in and I wondered why I was watching this again.Briefly... does this movie think it's being funny with the premise? Because it's not. The plot is nonsense, with many plot and logic holes. Outer space... okaaaaaaaay. The acting is weak. This \"super Jason\" is ridiculous.You'll see a lot of 7/10 and 8/10 reviews for this movie. Horror fans are an interesting lot. Why have to make do with more garbage films than probably any other genre. And we're more forgiving for franchises we enjoyed in the past.

Basically greedy government officials want to keep the ultimate weapon alive at the cost of anyone in a hundred mile radius. Of course Jason breaks loose and begins to kill and cut his way around the spaceship which is all fine and dandy... and then BAM, three consecutive nude scenes *yay* so far, it's basically the Friday the 13th Formula, despite the entire teacher sex scene (Which I will not even MENTION.) So finally they know Jason is around and BAM we hit the same formula again (i.e. Nerdy dude is electrocuted, stupid bimbo kills herself by accident.) And I must at this time comment that the chicks are even stupider in this edition (Who shoots Jason and then leaves him ON A TABLE BUILT FOR FIXING PEOPLE?) OK so then they fly around, blah blah, Jason then kills an entire crack squad of marines (Another ALIEN REFERENCE?) The teens panic and run around like chickens with their heads chopped off. Then Jason regenerates into something that will shame fans for many a year, he transforms into Uber-Jason. Luckily for us, he usually is only seen in walking sequences, that, and the occasional bang against a tree. The kids end up blowing up their entire Home space station (Is it made of glass? You'd think a space station would at least have a shield.) Then it comes down to the five, Tough black guy who sacrifices himself... (again) Cyborg and her (ugh) Human boyfriend... Slut who sleeps with the now deceased teacher. and the main chick. To make a long story short, The slut ends up having one of the stupidest deaths in the movie, that death could have been so amazing yet they are content to put some slices of bologna on the railing and BAM! A death scene. I won't ruin the very end for you, sufficient to say it also is reminiscent of ALIEN. The entire movie feels like it's being fed down you're throat, it has awful one-liners (32% :o), Terrible deaths that just reek of the other movies, and stupid teenagers AS USUAL. Yep, this sure was a great movie... The only time I would ever recommend this movie, is if a mad scientist gave you the choice of watching it, or eating Rusty nails, and even then, it's a close race.",

Not only am I surprised this did not go straight to video, it should never have even been given that honor. 'Jason X' reeks of bad-TV-movie from beginning to end. I don't even know that I would go so far as to say TV-movie. It reminds me something that would be categorized as the worst episode of the worst sci-fi series ever. From the terrible camera work, to the horrible special effects, to the embarrassing over-acting, to the ridiculously cheesy soundtrack, to the childish script, this movie has 'amateur' written all over it.When it goes for laughs, it fails miserably. The only laughing you will do during this movie will be unintentional on the part of the director, I guarantee that. On the other hand, there are absolutely no worthy scares. Of quite possibly the cheapest way to get scares - jump scenes - I counted one. And as I said, they are cheap. As for gore, there is nothing here that is worth anybody's time. I would guess that on half the kills, the camera cuts away just before the money shot. This is the business of a PG-rated movie, not an R-rated Jason film. Inexcusable. What gore they do show is laughable at best.In horror movies, you are supposed to like the characters and be rooting for them to survive. When characters then do die, it is that much harder to watch. In 'Jason X', you are rooting for everyone to die as painful a death as possible.and you don't even get that satisfaction.And on top of everything is the complete implausibility of the whole situation. But I won't even bother. By now, you will either take my advice and stay as far away from this movie as possible, or you are a glutton for pain.'Jason X' zero stars",

The scenario is at Crystal Lake, and it involves two women who want to \"drink beer, smoke pot, and have premarital sex\" with Jason.

Just watch it thinking that it is a spoof of Alien Resurrection and you can truly appreciate the movie. Don't try to take it seriously, because if you do, you will hate the movie, as well as miss the point. I mean, come on. It's a Jason movie in space. How can you possibly take that seriously? Honestly, no one should do that with Jason movies anyway, excluding the first one, which wasn't even truly a Jason movie. Do i need to remind you about the wheelchair death in Friday the 13th part 2? Or how about the death by weed-eater in part 7? Let's also not forget Jason takes Manhattan, which was hilarious. So, in essence, if you watch Jason X expecting to be scared or expecting a riveting plot line , you are watching the wrong movie. Go watch Halloween or the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre. On the other hand, if you want to laugh and still get to see gratuitous violence, then by all means, watch Jason X. It has all of the staples of the series and some fairly creative kills along with parts that are so ridiculous you can't help but laugh, such as the hologram sequences and uber-Jason. Overall, i think Jason X is highly underrated mostly because so many people don't have a sense of humor. The writers are obviously able to laugh at themselves, so you should be able to as well.",

Well you'd think so but this scenario actually works in Jason X, the tenth instalment of the Friday the 13th franchise and the second to be released by New Line Cinema after the debacle that was Jason Goes to Hell (1993) which promised to be the Final Friday, but of course it wasn't.Thanks to a witty script by Todd Farmer and smart direction by James Isaac this is an enjoyable sci-fi horror action movie and a welcome change to see Jason in a different setting. It delivers some inventive kills, is funny where it's supposed to be and is not as bad as some reviewers would have you believe. In fact I avoided watching this for almost 20 years as I thought the filmmakers had gone too far in a desperate attempt to keep the franchise going, I was pleasantly surprised to see just how good it was, even 20 years on.Produced by original Friday the 13th creator Sean S Cunningham with his son Noel Cunningham the gamble to put Jason Voorhees into space paid off, probably because this is for all intents and purposes Alien (1979), but instead of HR Giger's creature jumping out and killing the crew it's the unstoppable Jason who terrorises the spaceship. Played once again to good effect by Kane Hodder the serial killer gets a cool makeover when he's regenerated by nano technology after being cryogenically frozen since 2008 in an attempt to contain the killer.Jason X has the highest budget of all the Friday the 13th movies costing $11 million due largely to it's digital effects, where the average Friday movie would cost around $3 million. Not faring well at the box office upon it's release it's certainly worth a revisit and a reappraisal.Look out for an appearance by legendary horror film director David Cronenberg who, as Dr. Wimmer, holds Jason captive in the Crystal Lake Research Facility before he inevitably escapes.",

Unfortunately, Jason has also thawed out and does what he does best.Entertaining, good acting, great effects, and a pretty cool premise, but poor dialogue, the overall plot is nothing special, and there are some missed oppurtunities(Like with Uber-Jason for example). **1/2 out of *****.

Then in 1988, they stopped with Jason Takes Manhattan...then 5 years later, Jason is back in what most feel was a disappointing sequel. Well, now it has been 9 years since fans had a chance to see Jason on the big screen (well, in April anyway).  In my personal opinion, the series really did not need any entry like Jason X.  I really liked the Camp Ground settings, and running through the woods of Crystal Lake.  But to put Jason in space, 455 year into the future and to just make it an Aliens rip-off. Very unsatisfying!  I don't know if anything will be different on the version they put on screen, as what I saw on my bootleg copy, but I was very disappointed in the low-gore level this film had.  I agree with most other reviews...this film has not place in 2002, only because really decent horror films have gone down hill since the presentation of films like Scream or anything that has followed behind it.  People don't want to see Jason, Freddy or Michael anymore...well, except die hard fans like myself.  People are so saturated with PC quality horror films, they have forgotten the greats of the 80's. Corny jokes, bad dialog, slow pacing, and almost no gore really hurt this film.  Now, part 9 had satisfactory gore and was very violent...that is what one wants from a Jason film.  Not what part X is giving us.  The sets were nice, and well done, but you just can't past all the silliness, and unbelievable set-ups..even for a Friday film.  If Freddy Vs.

The actor's do try hard and it shows, they exchange witty comments while expressing actual fear at the same time. Kane Hodder does a great job reprising Jason Voorhees, he never says anything but he still can maintain that \"Jason\" feeling just by his body movements, and think that is partially the reason why this film works. I thought the idea of putting Jason in space was comical, but I wasn't so quick to disregard it because of a new setting, which many narrow-minded people have done. Jason is still himself, he just has new victims, new settings, and more advanced weapons they can fight him with. But not-surprisingly this film is absolutely flawless. There is a new element added to the series: Humor. The cast makes many one-liners and the scene in which (SPOILER) Uber Jason beats one promiscuous teen with another promiscuous teen is just flat out hilarious, it's one of those \"You have to see it\" moments. This is probably the most original Friday sequel, and many will say that this film does rip off Alien, but I don't think they are ripping off Alien, I feel that they were paying homage to a classic film. Overall \"Jason X\" is an excellent return to the big-screen for Jason, and credit is due to the cast and crew for creating an original Friday the 13th instead of staying in the woods. Kudos to New Line for going out on a limb with this film, I and many appreciate it. Hopefully this film will get \"Freddy VS Jason\" greenlight and lead to another Friday the 13th.",

I'm a little disappointed that the Jaws franchise hasn't made it that far yet, I'd have liked to have seen that.This time, it's Jason Voorhees, who gets cryogenically frozen in a cold open set in the present day. At this point the franchise had already established that the authorities recognized Jason as a real unkillable threat, not an urban legend, so it makes sense in-universe that certain unscrupulous people would want to study him to find out how he's avoiding a permanent death. Lexa Doig is great as Rowan, the scientist who determines that the safest way to deal with Jason is to freeze him. Unfortunately due to interference from an opportunistic colleague, she winds up being frozen along with Jason. These sequences are actually pretty decent and don't look too cheap. Fast forward four centuries though, and welcome to some production values that look like an Asylum flick on the Syfy channel. A team of improbably dressed explorers finds the cryochamber, defies all common sense in opening it, and then proceeds to behave in such a reckless manner that someone gets his arm hacked off. This turns out to be a group of teens on a space field trip, being led by an instructor (Jonathan Potts in fine smarmy form) who turns out to be more interested in making a few bucks on the side than in their educational welfare. They take both Rowan and Jason aboard their laboratory vessel and just as soon as two of the teens frolic off to get busy, the whole ship is in trouble. The rest of the film is Rowan, the students, crew and their space marine escort trying to first contain Jason, and failing that, escape from the ship as it falls apart. Kind of like one of the more recent Alien movies, except it's Jason and the special effects are sometimes hilariously special. There's a lot of live ammo being fired in confined spaces, which seems like a really bad idea in a space ship. Then there's an Aeon Flux inspired sequence, which the actress (Lisa Ryder) carries off with winky aplomb. Peter Mensah is also great as the redoubtable Sergeant Brodski. Overall, this is one of the weaker entries in the series, but it's got a lot of cheese appeal. It's definitely worth at least one watch.",

The first thing that came to mind was that little movie where the Leprechan went to space....In short, I was a little dissapointed with the concept.  Normally when a franchise character is sent to space, it's a pretty good indication that the film-maker's are starting to run out of ideas.  I was so discouraged, I skipped the theatrical run and waited for the dvd release.  Well, I just saw Jason X and I can happily say that I was surprised and I enjoyed the hell out of it.

In 2009, Jason dispatches half a dozen guys (all within the first five minutes) then he and a female scientist are frozen together.  Jump ahead to 2455, and a bunch of college-age kids find a very frozen Jason Vorhees and a female scientist.  Of course, Jason is brought back to their ship, thawed out, and the carnage starts.  In Jason X, there is no oscar-worthy performance, no strong character development, just all out FUN.  This entry has literally EVERY element that made the other nine movies so enjoyable and MUCH more to boot.  There is even a great showdown between Jason and a female android (the highlight). It's that kind of movie and fun stuff at that.Yeah sure, many of the purists already hated this movie before it was even released (much like I did) but if you sit through it and watch it for what it is (a Jason in space movie) I think you'll definitely enjoy it.",

            "content": "Being the 10th film in the franchise (Friday the 13th Part X), this film followed the exact same formula of its prior films. The difference was the change of scenery, last scene in Crystal lake (Part IX), before touring Manhattan for a Part VIII haha you'll definitely have to tune in for my review on that...i don't even want to call it a movie but i don't know what else to call it haha...Anyways Jason X mixes in a little history of Jason just to refresh everyone's memory of how brutally ruthless and maniacal this demon deformed man is. Another welcomed technique in this installment is how it remedies and takes pokes at the stupidity and simplicity of the 80s genre itself. I found this film very entertaining and although its not overwhelmingly scary by any means, it delivers and exciting and fun-filled horror film starring one of the stable mass killers of the 80s. If you enjoyed this, then you can catch more of Jason as he battles Freddy in Freddy V.s. Jason, in which its story plays out in similar style to Jason X rather than Freddy's most recent Film New Nightmare (1994). See this movie you'll appreciate it for what it was meant to be, a reminder that we haven't forgotten about Jason Voorhees and the minions of sex, drugs, and rock n roll teens hes decimated.",

            "content": "*major spoiler!*It had to happen sooner or later. \"Jason X,\" the tenth installment in the undying \"Friday the 13th\" series puts the masked killer in the 25th century. After being frozen for hundreds of years, he is revived aboard a interstellar craft, where he calmly picks up a machete and goes about his usual work. It sounds like a fan geek's dream, but that doesn't negate the fact that it's a pretty stupid movie. To be honest, it's also kind of dull up till the last act, more on that in a minute. Director James Isaac opens the film with a stylish credit sequence and sets up the story in a fairly interesting way, at least for a slasher. There is even a cameo by cult favorite David Cronenburg. However, as it goes on, it's clear that he has no real sense of pacing, nor does he often demonstrate the ability to scare us. To be fair, that would be hard to do with such flimsy material. It doesn't help that there are a couple of groan-inducing bits regarding severed body parts.The production values are just so-so, betraying its low-budget origins. I would have been much more forgiving in this area if treated to a good story, but it was not to be. The special effects are sometimes adequate, sometimes blatantly fake-looking. I wasn't expecting anything as good as Ridley Scott's \"Alien,\" but at the very least, they should have tried to make it swift and entertaining. The sixth, seventh, and eighth entries were fun to watch in a cheesy sort of way. They were pretty silly, but certainly diverting. \"Jason X\" is just plain bad. However, at least the third act picks up a bit, as an android crewmember apparently finishes the killer off--until he is revived as a cyborg. Still stupid, but more watchable.Needless to say, the acting is mediocre at best, but what could these performers have done with such poor material? At least Kane Hodder, as Jason, seems to be enjoying himself. One cast member in particular is as awful as Carrot Top, but he is thankfully dispatched early on. Lexa Doig, as the heroine, has some appeal, but there wasn't much she could do here. Most of the other actors are ineffectual at best, annoying at worst. I guess most slasher movies will always suffer these faults to a degree. This one certainly doesn't miss an obligation: the door is left open for a sequel.*1/2 (out of ****)Released by New Line Cinema",

This could possibly have worked but unfortunately the end result is just too lame.The script (what little there is of it) is heavily \"inspired\" by Alien, and filled with corny one liners. The cast is amateurish at best, and the sets and FX look like they were borrowed from some TV sci-fi show. And as two of the cast also appear on TV sci-fi show Andromeda, I almost expected to see Kevin Sorbo showing up to save the day.I know you cannot expect much of a Jason-in-space-in-the-future film, but that's still no reason for the film to look as bad as it does, or a script that's unable too spoof such an easy target as the Friday franchise.

How could sending Jason into space ever seem like a good idea? Not to mention the mere fact it takes place after the events of \"Freddy versus Jason\" really takes the surprise out of whether or not Jason loses in that movie. Which is too bad too, because \"Freddy versus Jason\" looks like \"Lawrence of Arabia\" next to this piece of garbage.The most ridiculous part is when \"evil gets an upgrade\" as the tagline so ridiculously puts it. Come on, this isn't necessary. Just because a \"Friday\" film is set in the future doesn't mean Jason has to change with the times, in fact he should be the only constant. It shouldn't matter what generation Jason is in, he should be able to be just as dangerous and effective a killing machine regardless of what he's wearing.This movie is guilty of countless crimes against the cinema. How this project ever got the green light is a complete and total mystery to me. At least when I saw it, someone else rented it, so I didn't have to spend my own money on it. Overall, I'd say this is not worth the rental, and it's barely worth watching even on television for free! It is an insult to the intelligent horror film fan.",

Though some of the killings shown are imaginative, others are so casually, even carelessly, presented, that you're left saying \"Huh?\" rather than screaming in terror (or laughter). My favorite in this respect: when the soldier Sven is yanked backward and has his neck broken, the two highly trained (LOL) soldiers with him don't even notice for several minutes. When they do, one asks \"Where the hell's Sven?\" - and that's that. No attempt is made to find/contact him or avenge his death. If the characters don't care, why should the audience?Special effects, which might have redeemed this, are poor and the movie otherwise has all the flaws of the genre \u0096 idiotic plot, characters who are any or all of stupid/greedy/venal, and a villain who is improbable \u0096 nay, impossible \u0096 to say the least.

This latest entry is one of the worst (although 8 & 9 were also very bad). There are so many, many movies about space - why did director James Isaac choose to make a Friday the 13th film if his real inspiration was the \"Alien\" movies. I actually found myself yawning throughout this film and did not find one single scene to be scary. It wasn't scary, it wasn't gross (one gross killing out of 30 is not enough) - it wasn't good. I hope if New Line decides to put out a new Friday film, they will put Jason back in the woods where he belongs and where he is scary, and give him back his old look of hockey mask and dirty farm clothing - the Uber-Jason at the end of the film looked much more like a comic book villain than a serial killer.",

Jason Goes to Hell was the better of the two but this movie (Jason X) was just utterly horrible. The characters are still composed of the traditional sex-crazed teenagers, with some adult authority kicking around. The new 'space-craze' phenomenon sucked in the Jason/Friday the 13th series and for some reason the director (whose name escapes me right now) must have had a perverse look at what it would be like in the year 2455. This is Flash Gordon meets Jason Voorhees type material, really pathetic. There is no time for character development at all, they die off too quickly for starts. The guy with his own personal robot was a little too icky for me, the sex-crazed couple, the corrupted leader who has his own issues with bondage. There is simply way too much stuff going on that doesn't need to be going on, big time although 'cheesy' special f/x and horrible dialogue really make for the most of the movie. Jason's appearance is still grotesque as always, there is the nutcase (supposedly) that knows of the Jason legend (sounds like Crazy Ralph to me) and then the new invention of the regeneration of dead tissue?

Any shot at success is limited to the parameters set by its original idea.  Is this a good movie?  No, it sucks, like all the Friday the 13th siblings but then this was never intended to be a movie(s) like \"The Sixth Sense\".  These kinds of films (Nightmare on Elm Street, Halloween sequels, Hellraiser etc.) are cinematic junk food.  But, hey, junk food is good, it just ain't roasted pheasant or even a sirloin on the grill.  This is nachos and hot dogs and tater tots.  Scenes and ideas are delivered to viewers with meaty presence and the whole Jason mythology gets several centuries to reinvent itself and establish his \"incredible rejuvinatory abilities\", none of which has ever been explained.  Nary a supernatural footnote has touched this series though there have been overtones as different films tried to move the series in different directions.  I find it interesting to compare this latest Jason entry to the original Friday the 13th to see how far we've come.  From shock and gore, groundbreaking at the time, to a Playstation game as (MINOR SPOILER !!!!!!!!!though no one seeing a trailer or poster can be spoiled by this)evidenced by Jason's upgrade.  This is the crop's cream, coming at the hopeful end of a successful series as opposed to Halloween the Original (which IS in a class with \"The Sixth Sense\" and \"Psycho\") whose best came first. Still, I have a soft spot for Jason and have, often begrudgingly kept up with his exploits.  I think maybe he deserves one more shot.  The right story, the right director, a film called simply \"Jason\".  Pull all the stops, pretend there hasn't been a series and use the best of all the contradicting mythology to make one slam bang story, still junk food, that can sort of be Jason's opus; the film that should have started it all. Then Jason can move comfortably into the video game realm where his future is set. If you like to nosh on junk food, this is fine noshing.

Jason X is of course the big nineties (or should I say noughties?) remake of the series but its done with such loving care and such a good sense of humour that anyone who enjoys good silly horror fun will love it. It's not terrifying but it has great jump shocks, imaginative deaths (minor spoiler) especially the frozen head one, and great little jokes.  The film starts a few years from now in Camp Crystal Lake Research centre where Jason is being held.  Unable to execute him this is where Jason has ended up but then of course some government people who think they can contain Jason turn up, ignore the cute scientist warning and do what they want. Anyhoo without spoiling it too much Jason and the women scientist end up cryogenically frozen and are then found by a group of teenagers on an expidition led by their professor a few hundred years later.  The idea of putting Jason in space may sound silly but it is thoroughly enjoyable.  This film is cool. Trust me.",

            "content": "The one pleasant surprise of \u0091Jason X' is a cameo by Cult Director David Cronenberg. Director James Isaac has worked on many of Cronenberg's films and plants his probable idol in the beginning sequences of this debacle of a film. One can contest the script, and even the pathetic dialogue, either way \u0096 one cannot contest the utter embarrassment of a film such as this.      Kane Hodder returns as the man behind the mask; Jason Voorhees, this time his killing spree is on a spaceship in the year 2455. Upon first encountering the film, I thought the filmmakers would finally have some fun with the killer and just let the story tell itself through blood and guts. Surprisingly, as compared to other Friday the 13th films of the past, this film lacks in the gratuitous violence department as in the gratuitous sex that always happened at the convenient time of Jason's decision to decapitate some young lovers.  Instead, writer Todd Farmer (who also has a supporting part in the film) demonstrates a love for the Jason films but does not include any surprising elements within the tenth film of the Jason Franchise. \u0091One liners' are bountiful as well as completely ridiculous sequences that force you to laugh.  The premise of this film is interesting but fails immediately following the revival of the cryogenically frozen Jason Voorhees. The film's introductory credit sequence displays an aortic sense of campiness that is followed through in the film on a regular basis. The musical score by \u0091Jason' veteran Harry Manfredini is his worst yet and adds no horror to a supposed horror film. It seems as if he knows he is wasting time and is repeating the same key on his 1980's synthesizer.     Our opening sequence demonstrates the power of our villain (or is he to some a Hero?) as he unleashes his affinity for mayhem. 400 years pass and we are made to understand that Jason Voorhees is a wonder of nature and as such must be studied as a specimen in order to extract all the information the scientists can obtain from him. Apparently his immediate reconstruction of tissue and cell is a wonder and the scientists want to study him for this purpose. Let us not forget, he has been drowned, electrocuted, stabbed, shot repeatedly, yet he always finds a way of resurrecting himself. In this film, he thaws himself out without any support. But the interesting pretext of science goes out the window as Jason once again unleashes his mayhem in outer space in a concept all too familiar of the original \u0091Alien' film.     Scripter Todd Farmer inserts some comedic one-liners at the expense of our current timeline. From the sport of hockey being banned in the year 2024 to DVD's being regarded as antiques, he tries to soften the film up with some tacky inserts but only degrades the story into complete disaster. Yet, the biggest criticism I reserve is for Director James Isaac who does not even make an attempt to make this film exciting or interesting. Fine, the script is laughable, yet as a Director it is your responsibility to make this film visually interesting at best. The sequences are shot as if they were done in a hurry and the casting of the majority of the young Canadian actors is a crime. The acting is just horrible and as aforementioned, no sense of heightened excitement is created by the Director's illogical sense of Direction. A point of observation is the finale in which Jason Voorhees gets \u0091booted up'. The film's tagline is \u0091EVIL GETS AN UPGRADE', that seems to be the selling point for the film's targeted audience. Yet when this creature does get an upgrade and becomes fiercer, more efficient and the most powerful killing machine of all time, the Director just frames the character as if it were any other scene.     The only difference is he introduces the audience to this new creation through the backlight of a silhouette shot and then continues on directing this miserable piece of film. At least some effort should be made to convey to us that the rest of the cast will eventually die due to an unstoppable creature, but when they do die, they are merely another number on his long list of victims. As one can see, there really is nothing new or interesting to see in this debauchery of a film. In our present technological age, I was at least expecting a film that had some grain of effort put into it. Instead, we are subject to prophetic campiness, a central character that does not frighten us any more, some horrible acting, horrible special effects and they even have the audacity to end this film with the possibility of creating another film in this series of film that should have ceased to exist a long time ago.Giancarlo's rating: BOMB",

            "content": "Contains SpoilersI Am ENORMOUS Friday The 13th Fan. I've watched all of them a few times, and now it's newest addition to the pathetic \"JASON GOES TO HELL\" hits the big screens here in Australia. Well in one word, all i can say is that i'm really DISAPPOINTED.There are numerous reasons as to why this film was a disappointing run in the series. Firstly, it is set in space. How can they damage the series so much by setting it 450 years into the future? Weren't they thinking? They have permanently scarred the Friday series- I think to a point, that it's too late for a \"Come Back\".There were many CONS in this film, that i will list first. (**MINOR SPOILERS**)Second Con- This film isn't CAMPY, the series used to have this feeling to it, that not many films did. The creepy atmosphere of the lakes, cabins, woods. It was great. Now we are thrown into space - something that resembles Star Trek. There is no \"Astmosphere\", the film is REALLY Cheesy, but it's not Campy, and thats what i miss most about the series.Third Con- the acting was DISMAL, by the Entire cast. Not one member of the cast proved themselves to be talented actors/actresses. Though i will admit that NO Friday film had much \"Talent\"- Yet this had to have the worst.Fourth Con- why the HELL is this film funny? Why have they taken the \"edge\" off the Jason Films? They have plagued this script, with INSANE one liners, they have made the mistake of what happened to the NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET SERIES from part 4- It's comical. People want to be scared, this didn't serve up as a horror film to me. Im sure MILD humor is appreciated in a horror film, but they honestly stretched it here, it came to the point where EVERY CHARACTER in the film said some STUPID line before they were killed by Jason.Fifth Con- The plot, in a way it is Original. Yet was THIS the only thing they could come up with?? Jason in Space? Original? Sure... ACCEPTABLE? HELL NO! Jason should be in the woods, thats where he belongs, all this \"Body Freezing\" - \"Time Warping\" and Star-ships were making me sick.Sixth Con- The Ending.Most Jason films had a cool ending, which would leave you \"Grasping\" for the next sequel. the Ending to JASON X was really lame. It was a Conclusive ending, so there wasn't really an End. It was really dumb how Jason and the Space dude, flew down from space to earth and Landed EXACTLY at Crystal lake? Its funny how they didn't discintegrate on their way down. It's also funny how those two lovers at the end, point to Jason and that Space Dude flying down from the air and say \"Look- it's a flying star\"...Ohhh it's SUCH a fairy-tale ending.Seventh Con- The Music. I REALLY Disliked the musical score of Jason X, it's the worst musical score since FRIDAY THE 13th PART 3. It was very repetative, and didn't have any build-up.Eighth Con- Special Effects. Seeming this was shot in \"Space\"- Special Effects are a very vital form to this movie- and the Special Effects were cheap and corny. The \"Space-ship Section\" looked like a floating webcam- im serious. When the ship would get VERY damaged and crash into citys, landing bays, docks, and other Ships, it explodes from the outside, and inside all the people are just holding on as the camera shakes a little bit- like in the power rangers. If they HAD to make this film in space, they could have at least TRIED to make the Special Effects look good.HERE ARE THE FEW PROS IN THE MOVIE.First Pro- Jason \"New look\". For the fast hour, Jason is plain old Jason, with the hockey mask, and hey thats cool. After getting his head blown off, he re-transforms, and has a new \"Metal\" mask, and i think it looks cool. Jason looks pretty creepy, and his \"Body-guard\" looks VERY good.Second Pro- Kane Hodder. The Man BEHIND Jasons mask. He plays his parts very well, although not his best, he does look like he usualy does, really big-stocky and strong. He is the BEST Jason, thats for sure.Third Pro- The Death Scenes. Jason is quiet \"Original\" with his deaths, he kills with creativity, and thats what i like. A girl gets her face frozen, and he smashes her face on the wall. Also a man falling into a \"Giant\" screw, and a FUNNY death is when Jason is smashing one girl into another girl. Very well done in this part.Fourth Pro- Attractive Cast. Wow the women were reallt stunning this film. This ALWAYS help a friday film by a few percent. Unfortunantley watching them die off aint so pretty.Fitfth Pro- Good Flashbacks. For a Brief moment in JASON X you are sent \"back\" or JASON is Sent back to Crystal Lake. It looks so cool how they did it, one VERY funny thing is that Jason is asked by two attractive 80's girls, if he wants to smoke pot with them and have Pre-marital sex because \"They love it\". Jason teaches them a thing or two after that. It was nice to see that glimpse of Crystal Lake- Oh how it will be missed.Thats my conclusion. I am a BIG Jason Fan, and i must admit JASON X has lowered my faith in the series. Yet this isn't the WORST of the series. It is better than parts (5,8 & 9) .So it's basically one of the worst Jason flicks, but i think its unfair to skip it. Especially if you are a fan, there are SOME redeeming qualities in the film. So i advise you check it out, dont expect anything great at all, and try to come with a \"Comical\" sense, instead of a Serious one. There were only TEN people in the Cinema watching this film and 3 people walked out, i find NO reason to walk out of this film. But i think its only \"Normal\" to leave the cinema with a feeling of \"Disappointment\"** (2 stars) - out of 5.",

But hey, I get to see it for free. I got a mini poster of Jason X. And I got to see what Jason really looks like. Good ole Kane Hodder introduced the movie. He looks just like a regular guy you'd see at the gym. Who knows, you could be working out right next to him!As for the movie, it was better than I thought (although I had way low expectations).The good: Jason wears his hockey mask through most of the movie. There's a lot of good kills. There is nudity.The bad: Acting is pretty weak. Story is pretty weak. Jokes are groaners. The fact that they keep cracking jokes after witnessing all of Jason's killings. I'm nostalgic for the shocked state of that chick at the end of Friday the 13 part 3. Towards the end they're really making a joke of Jason. The actresses act like they're in a Saturday Night Live skit.Things to note: They start off the movie with Jason about to be frozen at the Crystal Lake Research Lab (pretty gay, huh?). There's no explanation as to how he got there.They do set up for a sequel. But it's not a set up for another space thing.\nWhat was great about Friday the 13th and it's early sequels was that they played it seriously. It's sad that a lot of filmmakers think that horror fans want a movie filled with bad jokes and winks to the audience. If the characters in the movie aren't afraid of Jason, then why should we be?",

            "content": "Jason X is, like the other Friday the 13th movies, a real cheesy thing. And I guess it was meant to be like that.  I've not seen all of them, but enough to say that they are all pretty much the same thing (Jason comes back to life and murders many people at Crystal Lake).    Well, in this film, Crystal Lake has become a military research center (???).  This element was brought up simply to keep some of the older Jason movies' roots, but in that point, I think they failed.  Actually, in one way, it's really pointless, because a summer camp that becomes a research center in such a short period of time (since the last Friday The 13th film, which was released in 1991, I think, and Crystal Lake, in 2010 is a research center...huh?).   But it seems that the director wanted to keep some more fundamental roots; the bad acting.  I don't know how he could pay actors that were that bad...really, especially the girls...They are stupid, stereotyped, and, the most pointless thing, they are wearing some really fashioned, tight and \"show everything\" clothes.  I know this can be attractive for the male viewers, but really, this was pointless.  The actresses are so superficial, so lame, this director must have had something against women, because this film really shows them bad.  Lexa Doig, probably the worst in this film, says her lines too fast, she answers to the other character's questions like a machine...she's really bad, and the other blonde (Spoilers) that gets her face frozen and smashed is pretty awful too.    The futuristic aspect is just an excuse to bring Jason back to life.  The whole movie happens in spaceships, which could have been interesting (but, knowing that it's a Jason movie, I didn't really had sincere hopes of having something interesting), but the atmosphere is not really there...I'll still have to admit that this film keeps the old dark, \"almost (and that's being generous)scary\" mood of the Jason movies.    But there comes the part I really enjoyed...the gore!  If you've seen the previous Friday The 13th movies, you'll know that they are sometimes pretty gory.  This one has a surprisingly high gore level.  (Spoilers) A cop is sliced in half, many people are dismembered, killed with Jason's machete, many people are impaled...but that's nothing compared to what Jason gets...he gets shot like 300 times during the whole movie, and there's one place, where a female humanoid shoots him with a pretty powerful gun...Jason gets a leg, an arm and finally his head blown into pieces...and guess what...he still survives, not in the usual way, but you'll see what I'm talking about when you watch it.  the gore is abundant, and FINALLY! a recent movie that has some REAL gore.  What I mean by REAL gore is bloody special effects that are not made by computer...I'm really, really tired of that...computer-made gore does not and cannot look as good as the old fashioned way to make a bloody scene...with some real red liquid, with some real fake brains, I mean, with movies with really bad-looking gore such as Resident Evil and Blade, all directors should have realized that it simply doesn't work.  Gore made by computer is for me what Jar Jar Binks was for the Star Wars fans: BULL...you know the rest.  And, at least, Jim Isaac, Jason X's director understood that.  There are some scenes where the gore is made by CGI, but they have the excuse that it was in a video game (you'll understand if you see it).  This has some really nice gore.  Now, the killer.  Jason, the one we've known, is still the same...really, except for these short 5 minutes where he's \"upgraded\", but don't worry about that, it's nothing very important.  The whole movie puts its emphasis on Jason, who's butchering many characters, that have two functions: looking good on the screen, and getting killed.  I mean, most characters in this film are there to be slashed, really.  They're just cattle, human meat...that's it...And that's how it's always been, and that's how it still is.    The film is very repetitive.  It's always a couple of people, sometimes with weapons, that are trying to either kill or escape from Jason Voorhees. It's an hour and a half of that.  But for the Friday The 13th fans, this should be a great deal, and probably one of the best Jason movies.  It's lame, stupid, gory, and has some good-looking girls, that's all it's ever been, and that's all it still is.  Personnally, there's only the gore factor that really satisfied me, and I'd say that for gore fans, this is a nice deal too.  It's even gorier than many of the older films!  And it's funny to see how Jason would react in a futuristic world...  My lust of gore was satisfied, but if I had had the lust for a nice scenario...OUCH!  I would have wanted a refund!  Good gore, bad movie... I give it 4 out of 10.",

That said, this is one of those rare sequels that's much better than the original. In fact, this movie is light-years better than all the others in the franchise. Why? Because this is the first \"Friday the 13th\" movie that finally figured out what everyone else already knew, \"You know what? We're not producing an Oscar-winner here, so let's just have fun with it and see what develops.\" For example, Jason has Rowan (Lexa Doig) and two of her shipmates trapped in a sealed-off corner of the spaceship and is about to go in for the kill. That is, until Tsunaron strolls in behind Jason with a turbo-powered Kay-Em and gets Jason's attention by shouting, \"HEY SLAPPY!!!\" I was rolling on the floor laughing! The last thing I would think of saying to a homicidal maniac who's about to slice and dice me is, \"Hey Slappy!\" Yet that's what makes this movie so entertaining. People are about to be chopped into bits, and they're cracking jokes to get through their misery. You have two Virtual Reality Girls -- part of a throwback scene as the crew tries to divert Jason -- watching 'Ol Hockey Mask make a beeline toward them with his machete, and instead of running and screaming they ask him if he'd like to smoke some pot, take off their shirts and just stand there topless for him. And unlike earlier \"Friday the 13th\" movies, where you feel like the director would throw a punch at you in anger if you laughed during the movie, here you get a vibe that the folks who put together \"Jason X\" want you to laugh just as much as they want you to be scared. It's almost as much a dark comedy as it is a horror movie. Of course, the girls are the other great thing about this movie. Lexa Doig is HOT, Kay-Em is the hottest android around, Gekko (one of the commando grunts who got her neck slashed about halfway through the movie) is hot and most of the other girls in this movie are good-looking. Even the two Virtual Reality girls were hotties. They somehow made '80s hairstyles look good again. I wouldn't give any other \"Friday the 13th\" movies -- except MAYBE \"Freddy vs. Jason\" -- higher than a 4, and most quite frankly deserve a 1 even if you're simply watching them for the gore value. But \"Jason X\" is worthy of a solid 7. Probably the best movie ever made in the homicidal-maniac family of horror movies.",

Some good creep moments, lots of fun an in-jokes, some Jason-style carnage, hot looking women... what more could you ask for in this type of movie?If you're looking for a fun film that will make you smile and jump, you could do a lot worse than Jason X.",

            "content": "Ten movies.  Twenty-two years.  The unstoppable, hockey-masked being known as Jason Voorhees seems to have come a long way.  His greatest previous venture had him in Manhattan, but now he has gone to that special place where all horror franchises go to die \u0096 space.  Disregarding the fact that Jason went to Hell in the last film and the well-known fact that there has NEVER been a good franchise film set in space (ever), New Line Cinema green-lighted \"Jason X\", which promises and delivers nothing new, proving that the more things change, the more things stay the same.\tSet in 2455 on the space-ship Grendel, the film shows that in the future, female scientists are all teenagers that have been genetically engineered to look super-attractive and wear clothes that would make the primitive woman of today yell, \"Scandalous!\" Apparently, said genetic engineering has also kept said teenage \"scientists\" as dumb and horny as ever.  The only sensible one (male or female) of the lot is Rowan, the obvious heroine (obvious because she is still alive after the first half hour) who's been cryogenically frozen along with Jason for over 450 years, and has the most practical knowledge on how to deal with Jason (even though that knowledge is limited to, \"He can't be killed!\" and \"Run!\") and the many mishaps that always occur with advanced technology when tragedy strikes.\tJason has pretty much remained the same.  As in \"Jason Goes to Hell\" (the other New Line Friday the 13th Film), there have been slight changes, but it's still the same old big guy with a hatchet and a hockey mask.  The much touted \"upgrade\" to uber-mecha-Jason that occurs near the end is really more of a laugh than anything else, as he doesn't look scary, or even that sleek, just a bit goofier with a metal mask and red contacts.  Although he gets a couple unique killings, the majority of his kills still remain the same, hacked with his trademark machete or over-powered and crushed with his inhuman strength.  The film's best kill is one of the earliest, and one of the film's funniest moments of Jason violence occurs about ten minutes into the movie, thus showing that the producers of \"Jason X\" have no problem blowing their load early to insure that nobody walks out.\tThose two killings would be the only reason to stay if other parts of the movie weren't so funny.  The comic relief character (who looks suspiciously like Carrot Top), as is usually the case with comic relief characters, isn't funny on his own, so the producers make him funny (a rare accomplishment), by subjecting him to the second-funniest moment of Jason violence (committed while still frozen solid!) early on in the film.  The film's funniest moment occurs near the end, and, without giving it away, Jason meets images from his past with hilarious results.  In addition to the intentional humor, there is the unintentional humor from all the bad CGI (mainly in several \"explosions\" that take place in space outside the Grendel) and ludicrous (even for the genre and series) plot developments.  There are even some simple math errors in the dialogue because of the film's constant changes in release dates over the past couple years.\tWere it not for the humor, \"Jason X\" would be disappointing and unwatchable.  As it is, it's still disappointing, with some very entertaining cheesy moments, but who would expect anything more out of a Friday the 13th film or a horror franchise \"in space\" film? Fans of the series will no doubt enjoy this, and the best moments are amusing enough that the film's not a total waste of time and talent, but this just proves (along with \"Jason Goes to Hell\") that Jason Voorhees is just another \u009180s pop icon that is good for nostalgia or parody every so often but completely falls apart when resurrected for a new generation.",

Well guess what..I LIKED IT...AND I DON'T CARE. I loved the new direction the dying franchise took. It not only has the highest body count out of all the other 9 films , it has a nice parody of 80's Crystal Lake era towards the end as Jason is put into a animated computer version of Camp Blood with naked pot smoking campers. Now everyone hated it for basically 2 reasons..1) he's in space..2) it's more sci-fi than horror Well I agree the idea of taking Jason into space is sorta lame..it was bad enough to take Critters and the Leprechaun into space..but to mess with an icon like Jason was uncalled for ..but also it works surprisingly well...he finally gets out of the damn woods and way from the damn barn. The violence is way more extreme than in previous films , surprisingly since today's PC standards preach that slasher films inspire nothing but murder and mayhem..it is still pretty graphic for it's past standards. This is not going to be for all taste either. It is essentially a movie for die hard Jason fan's only...and we mean DIE HARD..not anyone who saw a few Friday The 13th movies late at night on tv and liked them..this is for people who sit around late at night and watch them chronilogically 10 x's in a row..and this is the most well done without any regard for the past films. Now some flaws: I felt like some of the attempts at one liner dialouge failed really hard , and the andriod Kay Em's personality during the fight sequence was downright annoying. It's still a refreshing change , sorta in the same vein as Part 9: Jason Goes To Hell in which the storyline is changed and an attempt to take the franchise into a new direction succeeds...despite what many bad reviews say..but ya know what I think..I think about 95% of the bad reviews from the fan's actually enjoyed the movie alot..but didn't want other people to know that they did..hehe i'm on to your game. It's a fun movie for the slasher fan only. Forget the acting , forget the plot ...great action..great gore..AND 28 DEAD BODIES!!!",

There are movies in the world, they don't want to tell you always 'bout real life, but they just want to entertain, and I think this is one of the way of entertainment with much more fun than the usual Hollywood-like-stuff.Indeed this movie has an own sort of quality, it is made as a high budget movie (you see that e.g. on the quality of the special effects) and expresses like \"Bride of Chucky\" a revival of the famous figures of the eighties like Jason (what was his real name?), Chucky or Michael Myers transfered and modernized for the new century/present time.By the way, in Germany we have a big discussion on these days about movies like Jason X or games like \"Counter Strike\". I just can say, I never came out of \"Braindead\", \"Day of the Dead\", \"Halloween\" or any other movie and wanted to kill any people, so if you feel so, dear reader, then please consult your doctor, because movies dont kill anyone, they are only something chemical projected on the wall, the question is, what we make of them, and that means, we are not guided with any movie to kill people, we always live in the wrong world, if we wish to kill... the only way to escape of this is to change our world... no one deserves to die - in reality...

His captor is awoken hundreds of years in the future on a transport ship.  Her pleas to have Voorhees dumped from the ship are ignored and before you know it Jason has thawed and is making up for lost time killing people left and right.I have never really been a fan of this series.  I saw the first one and found it confusing and have periodically seen parts of the others and found them a waste so I viewed this one with some fear.  I knew a friend gave it to me but was I wasting my time?  Not really.  The movie is actually fairly well written.  Sure the plot is overall silly but within it's own context it works.  The jokes are funny and the killing scenes are new and unusual (the sleeping bag had me fall off my chair laughing).  Some of the dialogue is amusing and the introduction of the android is a treat.

I chose to, on my 2 days off, before going to see Jason X, \"catch up\" on the other 9 chapters first, just to get a fresh idea of how they have changed in 20 years, over all I thought Jason X was really good, although they could have done without Kane Hodders own hair (or at least it looked like his own, if you ever seen him unmasked), vs. the old bald style.  I have heard this got bad ratings and i didn't know what to expect, but like I said if you really haven't followed the other 9 over the years then you'll get some people that thought it wasn't good, this is definitely a different kind of movie, one I don't think you can really just criticize like any other movie, If you like the other 9 chapters, you obviously do understand and put up with the Jason drowning as a boy/ time to get revenge story line, you'll like this one, I give it a 10 and will definitely add it to the other 9, in the old vault of F13'S.",

It wasn't as gory as I was expecting though, and after spending a few weeks watching disturbing torture porn, Jason X almost felt like a relief in a strange way. The murders were much quicker, and most of the time, much sillier. There were several laugh out loud moments in the movie. For me they included: - The scene in which Jason X almost hilariously takes inspiration from Hannibal Lector in a 'switcharoo'. - The man whose body has been chopped in half, hilariously still crawling. -\"What's going on out there?\" IT'S JASON F***ING VOORHEERS\" hehe - And the pure cartoon like violence of Jason beating the two camper girls with each others bodies.I don't think this film is in any way terrible, there were moments that made me jump and moments that made me laugh but not nearly as many moments rolling my eyes as I thought there could be.The actors are not brilliant, but they're not terrible. They're aware that they're in the 10th installment of a horror movie, but they still seem to give it a really good shot. All in all, it's just one of those movies. Enjoy it.

There are couple of inventive kills (\"he's screwed.\"), but most of them are just boring stabings and so on. I just want to add that I do know that this is a camp quality movie, but I still was a little disappointed 'cause I didn't find it that funny. Maybe it's just that I don't consider Jason to be as interesting and cool bad guy as, say Krueger and Myers.

I rented the DVD, turned off the lights, had some popcorn and dug in.  And was pleasantly surprised!People gasp at the thought of Jason in space, but they put him there in a logical manner, it's not like he hopped the nearest shuttle to get at the local Crystal Lake kid who became an astronaut, which is pretty much how he came to be in Manhatten.  He was in space at no action of his own, but he didn't seem to care.  He killed all the same, regardless of his location. And his methods were just as classic and inventive as they had always been, and Kane Hodder did a great repeat performance of the hero of the slasher genre.Anyone who is a die-hard fan of the series should at least give the film a chance, as well as those who aren't fans.

Ok, maybe all films do not have to follow each other, look at \"The Creature From The Black Lagoon\" He was shot and came back, they put him in a zoo, and then tried to make him more human by socializing him. All movie monsters, and that is what Jason is, going from a person who wanted revenge for the death of his mother, who was revenging his death, Or so she thought he was dead, just sorta turned to a monster, who unlike Freddy, who kills teens for thier parents sins, or Frankenstiens Monster,who kills because he is made fun of, lives to kill, anybody, not just teenagers anymore, he kills everybody.

            "content": "After being cryogenically frozen for 455 years, Jason awakens to stalk the crew of space ship The Grendel.More accurately, it's Aliens (1986) with Jason in it.According to Jason X's IMDB trivia page, writer Todd Farmer used Alien (1979) as inspiration for this film, even naming one character \"Dallas\". However, Jame Cameron's sequel is definitely what's being ripped off here:Main character Rowan is a Ripley rip-off, who also wakes up several years in the futureThere is a Burke rip-off who wants to use Jason for financial gainThere is a group of soldiers - lead by low-rent Lance Reddick - who try to take Jason out and get picked off one-by-one, with Ripley rip-off yelling at Burke rip-off to \"get them out of there!\", just like in AliensThere's (1) android amongst the crew (and they're a protagonist, like in Aliens), and they end up in pieces at the end of the movieThe characters are on a time limit because - like LV-426 - the ship is going to explodeLike one of the soldiers in Aliens, one character sacrificially blows themselves up after being woundedBoth movies conclude with a fight of a \"big bad\"; instead of the Queen Alien, here we get Uber JasonThere's also a character named \"Weylander\", an obvious reference to Weyland-YutaniThere is also low-rent Dennis Franz in this movie. This has nothing to do with Aliens thoughIt's pretty much the same movie, except done much, much worse.For a movie with the highest budget in the Friday/Jason series at $11M, Jason X comes off as cheap looking. I know $11M isn't much money, but the outer space effects look like something you'd see on the Sci-Fi channel. Supposedly one of the other ideas for this movie was to make the subtle change of putting Jason in a snow setting, which probably would've been much better. When you have no budget, less is usually more.Adding to the cheapness, there's a hilariously bad continuity error in the film. The machine Jason gets cryogenically frozen at the beginning of the film is stated as being manufactured in 2010. The movie takes place in 2455, and it's stated that Jason was frozen for 455 years. In other words, he was frozen in something that wasn't manufactured until 10 years later. Nice attention to detail.Jason looks like crap in this movie, by the way. He suddenly has hair, and the mask looks completely wrong. Also - the first five minutes of the movie take place at Crystal Lake Research Facility, and features a small role for director David Cronenberg. We're supposed to believe the rural-as-hell Crystal Lake area has a high tech research facility?The acting in this movie is probably the best in the entire series (though that's not saying much), with Peter Mensah's Sgt. Brodski being one of the more memorable protagonists in any Friday film. Jason X also features possibly the best kill in the franchise involving liquid nitrogen, though otherwise is a very tame movie violence wise.There's a lot of comedy in this movie, and it's pretty bad. Friday the 13th Part VI had a lot of comedy in it, but it was mostly tongue in cheek. In Jason X, the characters mostly play it straight, except when they inexplicably belt out horrible one liners right before they die. \"This sucks on so many levels\" says one character, before getting sucked through a metal grate into outer space. It's so damn cheesy.That's really the best way to describe Jason X: cheesy. It has a definite \"so bad it's good\" vibe to it. Even though it's bad, it's entertaining. I probably could've given it a 5 and lived with myself, but it loses as star for lack of originality - it's Aliens!By this point, the Friday the 13th franchise was dead. Jason X came out 8 years after Jason Goes to Hell and was a bomb commercially ($17M). It's so far removed from the original movie that it's mind blowing to think they're part of the same franchise.",

At that point, who cares if it's one of the better ones?I will admit, I found the fact that they were doing another Jason movie (especially Jason in space...sheesh) to be overkill, but, hey, it IS Jason we're talking about...the KING of overkill.  So, I decided, what the heck..it could be fun...and saw this one.  You know, it WAS fun.  Sure sure, the premise is stupid (ummm, really, what slasher film isn't?  Not like they have supertight plots with the best of acting) and the fact that he's now in space is just laughable.  But laugh I did.  There were just some great scenes in this one and the comedy sprinkled in wasn't the hokey, ridiculous high-on-pot bs that was so rampant in the first 5 of the series, nor was it some pathetic excuse for \"finding meaning\" behind what Jason does like the last 4.  Nope, this was pretty much a standard, run-of-the-mill slasher flick with little to no plot and just some good action.  When it comes to Friday the 13th, I can definitely live with that.Please, don't misunderstand what I'm saying.  I'm NOT saying this was a great movie (by no means), nor am I saying it's one of the best (that's just NOT possible...it could never live up to it's 80's predecessors).  I'm simply saying that for standard slice-n-dice and for those with a love of such movies, check it out. Let loose, don't expect more than this movie can give (c'mon, it's JASON IN SPACE for cryin out loud!) and simply have fun and let it ride.

You still know that in this kind of movie what is important is the lousy actresses, brainless and absolutely teenagely gorgeous. Well having this in mind, you might as well have one hell of a KILLING time.\nNow, to be honest, when I heard that the movie i was about to see here in Spain was the director's cut and that the movie was being cut in the US for a theatrical release, I thought I was about to see something really good in extreme, but nooooo. All I saw was the average blood and killings as the rest of the saga. But, and this is important, this time the body count is higher, and some of the killing were some of the most innovative in the whole series (i wont say which ones not to spoil it for you).\nThe production was quite low budget, and still it manages to work well with what it had, some of the special effects were average, some lousily bad and some good. But when the time of kick butt came for the gorgeous she-android...believe me, it was worth the wait. Besides, there was something in the environment, the fact of seeing jason with a new machete-like cutting device, the uber-jason, the claustrophobic tunnels, the virtual crystal lake, and the bad acted screams, that are priceless for a horror fan like myself.Perhaps this one wont be at the horror hall of fame, and I don't really care.

Why on earth don't these pathetic stupid ass Fat-Cat producers call it a day? My only assumption as to why this maybe is because of the DVD craze that's seeming to sweep the everyday market. Let's be realistic although I know I'm interviewing, horror films are too making a major comeback on this market since alot of over-looked materials are being given a spruced up transfer. Example to this are the many films released by Anchor Bay entertainment that can't seem to stop with their elaborate collection of horror features. And impressive box-sets (i.e. Nightmare on Em Street collection and The Beyond). Anyway back to the review.Okay this movie opens up in the \"21st Century\", with David Cronnenberg making a short appearance only to be (oh sorry can't give away).Nice chicks I must admit as this film had more than just a hand full to deal with (ain't Lexa Doig a Hot-Dog in this?)It was also good seeing Kane Hodder reprising his role as the infamous Jason with some kick ass bio upgrade to his figure and mask. However what compelled me to watch this stupid piece of crap junk was it's technical achievements considering that this too was shot on digital beating out Attack of the Clones as the first film to be released digitally.All in all not bad but take several things to take into account incase you've been following the Friday series avidly: Slashings, stupid Jason walks, dumb acting, flat rate dialogue, sex and the classic \"chi chi cha cha\" sound.For me it was so s**t it's good how ironic don't you think? 6/10",

I kind of felt like I was watching Star Wars. Personally, I think they should have made a Friday the 13th that takes place in 2002, not 2455. The film was a mix of Star Wars, Aliens, and worst of all Zenon, Girl of the 21st century. One thing that shocked me is that Sean Cunningham was involved with this. In 1980 he was the one who gave us Friday the 13th, my favorite horror film of all time. But the following year, Steve Miner took over, and gave Friday the 13th part 2, and part 3 in 1982. In 84' part 4 was given to us. I've said this before, but Why didn't they just STOP right there? Parts 5-9 came, and the series was literally destroyed. They butchered it. Some people just always have to ruin a good thing. But on April 26, 2002, Friday the 13th lost its dignity. I know I'm being a little bit dramatic, but its true. I honestly have to say that the horror genre is dead.Jason X rating- 3/10",

Looking like it was filmed in a tacky '90's laser quest arena; the film contains a myriad of my pet peeves from later day horrors including terrible CGI and a huge cast of indistinct characters devoid of personality who wisecrack on their deathbed. It is lame on every level, with bad acting, and a dire script. I could overlook some of this if it was entertaining. However it is minute after minute of people walking down spaceship corridors, spouting sci-fi gobbledygook into headsets or talking into computer monitors about how to open doors or land the craft that no one on board appears to know how to operate. Inexcusably Jason's not really very noticeable. He does have a Terminator style makeover which was briefly mildly amusing. Overall he is involved in the dullest set of deaths, non-scares and chases the series has seen. There was a glimmer of a good idea near the end where Jason was placed in a virtual reality Crystal Lake but that was quickly squandered. Potentially the set-up could have worked in more talented hands, but it remains a rancid turd which feels as if it was written by someone with no love for horror (or even sci-fi) films. Gross.",

This movie was only made as a quick cash grab, which just ended up being a flop anyway. The movie really bad too as awesome as the idea of Jason Voorhees in space should be.At least Kane Hodder is back as Jason, so that's a little bit of credit because he happens to be the coolest one to play the serial killer. Still in Jason X, he brings almost nothing to the movie.Pretty much, Jason comes back to life, in space this time, and he attacks, then is frozen. He is thawed in the year 2455, by plenty of attractive twenty-something astronauts. Eventually, he'll be picking em' off one by one until there's no more left and that's expected of him.The issue here is that we never even care about the characters for a second. No one is that likable because there was almost no character building. It's shocking that the characters even have names rather than just Girl #1, Boy #1. When they die, maybe we can say that it was a pretty cool kill but we really never feel for the characters that it's at all important to us when that happens.Another obvious problem with the movie is special effects. You would think that a movie set in space would have great special effects, especially considered what was available to them in the early 2000's. Everything in here looks fake especially all the outer space scenes.I also wanted to mention that it's crazy that the hockey mask pretty much changes in every film and in this film it is very round shaped and looks really ridiculous. It's strange to nitpick tiny things like the shape of the mask but it looks odd compared to the other great ones and a lot less scary. When he turns into the cyborg Jason, it's definitely a much better look for him as he is powerful, but it still isn't that scary.

So it shouldn't be surprising that the movie itself isn't scary, or frankly even watchable.The concept of the omnipresent, omnipotent, omniscient bad guy is quite old, dating back to Laurel and Hardy meeting the Mummy. As a basis for true horror it simply lacks power.This is because horror stories must have rules. A movie can not be compelling or suspenseful if the villain has no defining boundaries, no weaknesses. Zombies can be decapitated. Vampires can be staked, broiled in the sun, sauteed with garlic. Werewolves catch a silver bullet. But what kills Jason?As ten movies have slavishly documented, apparently nothing. In this film he absorbs thousands of bullets and remains standing. He is a marksman with his machete, capable of piercing your heart at 1000 yards with a tomahawk throw. He has the strength of whatever number of men necessary to complete the superhuman feat being filmed. If decapitated, he becomes a computer virus, then morphs into some Borg creature. This guy's like a frickin' Go-Bot.The original story was, I believe, about a boy who drowned at summer camp and came back from the dead to exact revenge. It was an effective scary movie, setting very good tone and just being generally creepy. How has this concept morphed into a story about a cybernetic killer on a spaceship?\nAdding insult to injury is the slipshod manner in which the story is presented. The sets are fakey, the actors low-rent pretty faces who cannot even keep from smirking. There is little gore, and no innovative or particularly gruesome deaths. The one-liners are just not funny. In fact, the jokes scattered throughout the movie are all unfunny, and do nothing to help the already uninvolving atmosphere.I'm simply left wondering: what is the point? The movie fails to scare, so it's not a horror film. It fails to generate laughter, so it's not a comedy. It couldn't be drama if that was Glenn Close behind the hockey mask. There is simply no reason for this movie to exist. It has no audience, except people who can be suckered in by the name brand.Lest I sound too critical, I will state that there is one scene - one - in the film that worked. Do not read ahead if you don't want it spoiled. At the end, one of the characters has the brilliant idea to decoy Jason at a critical moment by projecting a holographic camper in a sleeping bag for him to kill. That made me laugh. He may be a sellout, but Jason sure hates them campers.",

You watch Jason Goes to Hell and your first thought is \"That is such a blatant rip-off of The Hidden, it should be called plagarism.\" and then you think \"Well, they couldn't possibly make a movie worse than part 9.\" then Jason X comes out. Not only is this one of the worst movies ever made, the crew touted it has the best script ever. I would like to see what script they were reading, because someone must have pulled the switcheroo on them when they started filming. This film is not only horrible on every single possible level, it is pointless and has no redeeming values. This isnt even a film thats so bad, you can laugh and enjoy it. This film is so bad, when you're done you want to physically harm those who wrote, directed, and produced. i haven't seen this much harm done to a franchise since Batman & Robin....and this is actually worse, if you can believe it.

I have hope for Freddy vs. Jason...and I really don't think you can make a worse film than Jason X, but I'm sure the producers will surprise me with the next Jason-only friday film.",

But, I was surprised...they did a great job with this movie. What saved the movie was that when the movie moved from present time to the future, no one tried to make the future time setting into a crazy Star Trek type setting. Everyone still acted the same & in many ways, it was still like a old Friday movie. Decent direction & writing make this movie enjoyable for fans & other movie goers. When Jason is frozen at a cryo-facility (since he can't really be killed), his body & a female's are discovered over 400 years later by a scientific expedition team. (Earth is no longer inhabitated, since it has become a 'dead' planet). But when the two are brought onboard the space vessel, it is too late. Before the female can warn the others about Jason, he thaws out & wrecks havoc on the ship. Some great effects & death scenes make the movie fun. Also, keep an eye out for the Camp scenes towards the end...these are hilarious.",

I read in IMDB that it is going to be released in April but I can\u00b4t understand it, I saw it in November here, precisely the same week that Jeepers Creepers arrived, and while I was a bit dissapointed with that second one for some strange reason, I wasn\u00b4t with this. I saw exactly what I was expecting for and although it was a weak movie, I didn\u00b4t get surprised. Jason appears now in space and a lot of years later but the formula hasn\u00b4t changed, this is like an Alien movie but changing the monster for Jason and of course it is totally a B movie.The best of it was no doubt, the homage it pays to the first movies of the series in the first eighties, I laughed a lot at this part but for the rest I think it\u00b4s time to close the series in a definitive way,the same for Halloween because I am at the top of the tether about useless Halloween sequels and I have read that they have made another one, very original, they say but I would be a fool if i believed it. Well, I don\u00b4t know if Jason x will be finally released there but the only good thing would be that it encouraged that old project of Freddy VS Jason, if they got to write a good script sure it would be funny but I suppose it will be finally removed.",

Enough to describe what a shambles and travesty this movie actually is but alas i found it was not possible.This movie takes place 400 years after the last Friday the 13th movie and has Jason hacking and slashing his way through the student crew of a space station. As desperate and ridiculous as this premise sounds, i was always waiting for this franchise to take an interesting turn (the others all sucked) and with this i was hoping that my rants and raves would be answered.And in a way they were. This is very different from the rest if you look at it in a scewed point of view. The fact that it is set in space is a blatant IN-YOUR-FACE way of saying \"hey look, we've done something new. Please give this franchise the respect we've been dying for\" but i dont buy it. Just because it is set at such a ridiculus time in the future it still doesn't detract from the fact that it is still just your generic horror yarn.The horny kids get maimed, none of the other characters believe the heroine as to how much danger their in, people run upstairs when the front door is right next to them...other than its setting this film offers very little to an already over played and tried and tested method that makes the Friday The 13th films such a labour to watch.As with every horror movie there is always a hint of humour to stop the film from becoming too serious but this one makes you laugh non stop. Just like Pearl Harbour this film is unintentionally funny and this is mainly due to the performances. The acting in this film is shocking to say the least. The \"actors\" (if that's what you want to call them) plod their way through the film as if they couldn't care less. These guys look as thought they've just graduated from their community acting group.I can say that my opinion of this film is slightly bias in a way as i have never liked any of the Friday The 13th films but i was hoping for something new. i guess i was mistaken and foolish for not walking out of this movie. I was sitting there hoping for it to get good but when the end credits came i was appologising to myself for sitting through such unadulterated garbage.Whenever i review a movie i try and find a critical way to let a bad film down but all i can say about this one is this: it sucks. Jason X is Shit! The only thing it has going for it is that it is not John Carpenter's Ghosts Of Mars. I'd much rather go and watch Freddy Vs Jason again. At least that movie was fun.1/5",

This was just pathetic (\"this sucks in more ways than one\"). At least some of the other Fridays gave you a couple of jolts when Jason would jump out of a dark corner. The camera is basically on Jason throughout the entire movie. In this one, Jason is primping for the camera. I know that this review is probably biased in the eyes of a F13 fan, buy I believe that most of those fans will agree that, Yeah, this movie was really bad.

The plain and simple answer is NO. The idea was of great interest to me of could you possibly after ten films still make a great Friday the 13th film. This entry is weak and makes some of the others in a worse condition than this look like they should win an Oscar.Jason is cryogenically frozen along with a young woman who is trying to make sure he never kills again. Jason makes it so they both freeze for four hundred years. Along come a team of students and stumble upon the pair frozen and decide to take them to their ship in space and thaw the woman out and keep Jason as a piece of history, but Jason has other plans. He awakens and all havoc and body parts break loose.The film is poor in the fact that it feels more like a sci-fi film than a horror sci-fi film. There is no horror what so ever no jump out of your seat moments at all and for a film in this franchise that wasn't what i was expecting.The acting is appalling and the one liners are totally stupid. For example this tough navy seal kick ass type gets impaled through a door by Jason to which he says \"It's gonna take more than a poke in the ribs to put down this old dog\" Jason sends a blade through him and he says \"Yeah, that oughta do it\" i mean that just isn't horror thats comedic.The writing is full of that stuff and the story is totally stupid and a totally uncalled for sequel really.The action was great but over within a few minutes of actually getting started. Jason is as menacing as ever and makes some good kills but again its nothing we haven't seen before but it will be enjoyable to the gore fest fan.The direction has to be called upon too because this guy really has no sense of what a horror film is because he has put none of it in this picture and to be honest i'd be ashamed to call this a Friday the 13th film.Overall the film is just a dumb piece of horror that shouldn't even be called that. If your after craptacular special effects, stupid screaming from stupid girls and some kick ass gore then this is the film for you otherwise avoid unless desperate for something to do!! ***** out of **********",

            "content": "(I am Reviewing this Film in the Context of the Series and as mildly as possible as an actual Film on its own)To quote a line from the Film itself which perfectly describes the Whole experience \"This sucks on so many levels!\". If one would want to describe the Whole Film in as sparse words as possible it could simply be described as \"Jason in Space\" or \"Imagine Alien without the Alien but with Jason instead and much cheaper looking\".First a bit about the Background of this Flick, it had the Biggest Budget of the main series (1-10) and it was meant as an re-igniter for the franchise, for the reason of \"Jason goes to Hell\" being the introduction for the long planned \"Freddy vs Jason\" (which finally came to fruition in 2003), one of the writers had the idea of Sending him to Space so the series could get a fresh entry.The problems of this sequel are to many to count, from unnecessary transition scenes that break the mood to a horrible and cheap sounding Film Score, Bad lighting, and and and. The Worst problem of this Sequel is that you can see and feel that the Sets got made cheap and fast and the CGI was worse than on most TV Shows that where made in the 90s and the Dialogues where laughable Bad (even for a Friday the 13th Film). There are so many scenes where you force yourself trough and think how in the F#@*ing Hell did this get green-lit. Some examples: One of the Characters gets grabbed trough a Wall by his throat and Jason Pushes his Machete through the Wall and his back, the character says something like \"aah oh god, how could you think you can kill me like this\" and Jason Punches another Sharp object through and the Character says \"ah that's it two is better than one\" and he faints. Or a scene near the End Where a protagonist gets sucked trough a whole and right before she falls trough she says \"this sucks on so many levels\". This Film made me angry as i was plowing through the Whole Series, which grew to my Heart even if most of them where Trash they at least where a Big Bumper Bag of Fun, this one is not. One highlight of this Flick was a Scene where trough VR technology Jason gets transported to the 80s Crystal Lake and kills two Chicks in old Classic fashion, and as a wink to one of his predecessors, he hammers a girl in a sleeping bag against a tree.This Film was an affront to everything that was Fun to the Series, the other Films where made way cheaper but managed to look way more expensive. The Director didn't seem to have enough of Fantasy and Vision, as laughable as the Idea may be imagine a more talented Director at the Helm. Ugly, Laughable, Boring and a Machete to the heart to one or mostly many fans of the Series. Don't watch this Film!!!",

In my opinion the last true Jason episode opened up May friday the 13th 1988. The last two Friday the 13th films were a calamity so I was thinking that this one would join the ranks of those two. In fact this was the first Friday the 13th I missed in the theater since Part 2(I was too young), so I wasn't expecting much from this one. Jason 10 boasts some of the worst acting of the series and the plot is as tenuous as it gets BUT that's not what we are viewing this for. There are a myriad of innovative deaths on display that offer us some of the goriest murders this series has to offer. Add a bevy of lascivious babes to this and a scene from Camp Crystal Lake and well What the Hell are people complaining about. After viewing the catastrophic events that unfolded in Jason Goes To Hell, just about anything they attempted next would work. If they would've released this film in 1994 right after Jason Goes To hell, this film would've been lauded just for the fact that we SEE Jason (not some bloody lizard that go's through bodies) slashing away on the screen. I'm not saying that this is a great film, it isn't. In fact I rank this better than only Part5,8 and 9 but at the end of the day our slasher hero from the 80's is back to slash today's generation. I hope they make another Friday the 13th and deposit Jason back into the woods where he belongs. If they do this and slot in copious nudity, sex and blood well we could finally have a Jason film rival some of the classics from the 80's.",

I do think that it was pointless to put Jason in space because the whole idea lead the series nowhere.In the last Friday The 13th movie Jason Goes To Hell: The Final Friday, Jason's full body goes straight into hell. Now all of a sudden this movie begins when Jason is captured in a place called the Crystal Cake Research Facility as if the last movie was ignored. When captured in the facility he looks nothing like he did in any of the other movies in the series, especially the mask and the whole research facility is keeping Jason's body because it was discovered that he can regenerate lost and damaged tissue. I dislike how they added this into the story because if Jason was really able to regenerate lost and damaged tissue why would does his skin look like such a wreck in the previous films? I think he would be able to look good as new if he could regenerate lost and damaged tissue if you ask me.What I did like about this movie is it did have some creative kills in it. Jason sticks a woman's face in below freezing water then smashes her face right on the counter and her whole face literally breaks apart.I did not like how Jason gets an upgrade in this movie simply because Jason with metal protection and fierce red eyes is not the Jason I know. I didn't find him creepy looking at all once this happened.This movie is not horrible nor is it great, it's mediocre. Not the best movie in the franchise but certainly not the worst.",

It seems Jason Vorhees is held in custody on some ship somewhere in space and when some real geniuses release him he goes on a short killing spree that is prematurely ended when he gets cryogenically frozen. Some 400 or so years later, he is thawed out and goes on another killing spree on the ship. It seems some people can never leave well enough alone.

I guess Disneyland was closed and the Blair Witch took over his turf.In this tenth entry in the ongoing horror series,  Jason Vorhees is put into cryo-stasis and brought back into the 25th century.  He's on a spaceship and gets back on track with his killing spree.  What more is there to say? Oh, sorry, he gets an upgrade, ROBO-JASON.  He can now play Windows 95 and DOS on his Hockey mask and his breathing is now in surround sound.\nI will never figure out why there is still a demand for these films to keep getting made, other then to see if they can actually make it to # 13.  Oh yeah, now that particular date no longer has any application to the film series.  But then again it didn't matter in the first place since the date was just put in to be a selling point for the movie.This film not only sports the played-out theme of the unstoppable, silent, slow walking slasher, but sports another played-out \"there's a scary ,killer monster on our spaceship ,so let's blow it up and split!\".  When will sci-fi writers realize that there are other horror/sci-fi plots then the one from \"Alien\"?So it seems that no one in the supposedly sophisticated science team is any smarter then the dim-witted co-eds from Camp Crystal Lake.  All the same tactical mistakes are made by them like pre-marital sex, foolish curiosity , and now a new one.  The thought of using Jasons' cell regeneration to turn a profit.  Every last murder is seen a mile away, so it's quite predictable. Each death is treated with a manner of gory originality, whoopie.The film uses the Sci-Fi motif to try to breath new life to the franchise, but there is nothing in this film that make the story more interesting, just more lethargic.  There is even on scene where the film tries to be a joke on itself when one of the characters tries to distract Jason with a VR version of Camp Crystal Lake and a couple of Campers asking Jason if he wants to smoke pot and have premarital sex.  What a Knee-slapper.  And as for Jasons' \"Upgrade\", it happens in the last ten minutes of the film and he doesn't do much with it.  He just looks like he belongs on \"The Power Rangers\".\nI didn't expect much from this film, I wanted to try to get some idea to what the appeal of this film series is to the public, but I still don't understand why there is still a demand to see further installments about this terrorist.The only thing that this film series seems to present is more and more creative and vulgar ways to kill one-dimensional characters.  There are rules to Horror films and they have to have a logic to them.  Jaws was the age old concept of Man vs Nature.  Nightmare on Elm Street dealt with the complex theme of dreams.  Scream explored teen copy-catters. Jason just seems to be a living contraction with legs and a hockey mask.  He's brown, crusty, nothing kills him and he just seems to come out when teens are having un-safe sex.This film is said to be the audition to see if the studio will go forth and make the supposed \"Jason vs Freddy\" movie.  Even after getting the snott knocked out of him by Spider-man two weeks later, the studio says it's going to happen.  I don't get it , I just don't get it.  Indiana Jones, Superman, Batman and the Ghostbusters get the highest demand for a sequel and they don't get made.  But Jason films seem to make the Energizer Bunny green with envy. A mystery never to be solvedTo sum up, I don't think I need to warn anyone not to waste their money on Jason X cause his slow walking seems to be fast enough to get him to video.",

So, everyone here is killed, and this girl is left there, frozen, for over 400 years? No one ever wonders what might have happened to these folks? Okay. And people have forgotten what bicycles and hockey were, but there's a guy who knows Jason's story all these centuries later, yet apparently he's the only one? Did I miss something here? It just seems weird that Jason's legend has survived this long but no one but this one guy knows about him. Also, no one seems to be able to grasp the basic concept that shooting him doesn't work. They waste all this time dragging around weapons and shooting at the guy, when they could be finding a way to shoot his tail out into space and be done with it. The Matrix-Trinity-Wannabe robot was completely ridiculous. The campers seem really unconvincing when they're giggling about \"premarital sex\". I mean, come on, what teenager calls it that? It was corny. And how's this for clever dialogue (I'm paraphrasing): \"You're lucky you weren't around during the Microsoft conflict. We were beating each other with our own severed limbs.\" WHAT? Stupid movie. There are a thousand other flaws in this movie, but to attempt to list them all would take many hours. Entire volumes could be written about the stupidity that is present in this film.I am begging you people, don't continue to give these people your money so that they can churn out these pointless, wasteful, idiotic movies. It's shameful that people go hungry while this kind of CRAP gets made, year in and year out. Plus, every time you watch a movie like this, part of your brain atrophies. It's bad for you. Go watch something good!",

This took a much needed break from the scantily-clad-teens-being-hacked-up-in-the-forest plot, and has pretty much the same, but in SPACE. This had it all. No delaying. Bloody kill by bloody kill, to the very last bloody kill, this was awesome. Also, I loved the Cyber-Jason. It's like the lamberghini of Jason outfits. I really thougt this whole movie was just awesome. The environments, and the creativity were truly dazzling. Also, there were extremely awesome CGI effects. Many of the kills were computer animated, and this film got creative. Jason doesn't just grab you and choke you, he grabs you, sticks your face in liquid nitrogen, and smashes your face into icy smithereens on the counter top. He also uses a multitude of new weapons, including a souped up machete, and a spiky chain. Every detail that was established in all the other F13 films were utilized here to, plus more. Jason CAN NOT DIE. This is really the first film that has that down pat. It wasn't til one of the later sequels (I believe it was the 5th) where Jason is actually brought back from being dead. In this, he has his head blown off, and his legs and arms too. He seems dead. But, those damn robo spiders fix him up. Many parts of this movie were like \"Star Trek\" meets \"Friday the 13th\" but after seeing it, that was actually a smart move. The time and effort of the makers paid off, and this was a much needed break from the nonstop F13 sequels, plus more. Any horror or action fan should see this. 9 out of 10. .",

            "content": "Jason X is the first Friday the 13th movie I've seen, so long time fans of the series will have to excuse my possible ignorance.  The critics, for the most part, are having a grand time taking apart Jason X.  I agree that the characters were underdeveloped and the story is predictable, etc, etc, but what did you expect?  Nobody in their right mind goes into a slasher expecting great social commentary or Oscar winning performances.  This is Friday the 13th, not Schindler's List, people.  The humor is overused, although I did roar laughing at Jason's solution to a certain problem involving sleeping bags- You'll know what I'm talking about once you see it.  The major complaint I have is the women's costumes, or lack there of.  They just aren't realistic for students and scientists.  In addition, it seemed that Jason had landed on the Love Boat in space-- the students seemed to be just a little sex-crazed. Kane Hodder is great as the silent Jason, and Lexa Doig does a good job in her role as well.  The remainder of the cast isn't remarkable, but I guess they were working from a script.  As another user commented, the script does go downhill a little, degrading into one-liners and hiding behind a lot of empty humor.  Will Jason X be enough to kick the series into some sort of resurrection? [Speaking of resurrections, be on the lookout for Halloween: Resurrection - I'm willing to bet critics will be equally unkind. Then again, critics are an inconsistent lot] Perhaps it will be.  I've heard that Jason X's budget was in the area of 14 million, a rather conservative figure.  As such, it won't be too difficult for the movie to turn a profit, unless it bombs miserably, which I doubt.  That is to say, I'm certain that the movie will make over 14 million once it's been released world wide.  How much it makes will determine the future of the franchise, and who knows...maybe fans will get the Jason V.S. Freddy movie they've been wishing for so long....but don't expect critics to be kind to that effort either.",

I was expecting a good laugh because \"Stalk and Slash\" films are just that way: Laughable.  They're not to be taken seriously; they're meant to be laughed at for the schlock acting, the bad jokes, and cheers when the Class-A Dummy or Class-A Jerk gets killed.I wanted to laugh at it in the same way I laugh at Ed Wood films.  There's nothing funnier than watching Bela Lugosi scream in the throes of being attacked by a mechanical-octopus-with-no-motor badly mixed with documentary footage of an actual octopus.  Even satires of horror movies with God-awful humor (\"Repossessed\" and the \"Scary Movie\" series, to name a few), get a few laughs out of me because I'm not expecting intellect or ingenuity in these films.  I expect to laugh like the Nelson Muntz character of \"The Simpsons\" for the cheapness.I laughed even harder when I watched \"Leprechaun in the Hood\", which I think is the best of the Leprechaun series, if you're looking for the same cheap laughability I've been mentioning in the past few paragraphs.This movie was just a high-priced, piece of nothing that couldn't scare a stray cigarette ash off your finger tip, ...And I had to make an effort to find things to laugh at.Okay, the smashing of the frozen face was cool.  I don't care what the documentaries on the DVD say, do, or show; they don't justify the lameness of trying to release this.

I really think that Jason would have actually preferred to be sent to hell instead of shooting this garbage. There is absolutely no connection between this movie and the rest of the series (well, the IX part has also nothing to do with it, so it looks like that is nothing new).Pitiful enough, I used to like the good old fashion Jason movies, specially the first 4 of them. They were stupid, yes, but they were also scary. Then, they decided that Jason alone wasn't enough to attract audiences, so they began to mix a lot of films in one, aimed to engross the box offices. BAD MISTAKE! What came to my mind while I was watching this (yes, I was THAT bored) is that the producer wanted to do a lot of films rip offs (Aliens, Friday the 13th, Event Horizon, Blade Runner, Prince of darkness and God knows how many mores), but he was given money enough to make just ONE movie, so he decided to fuzz it all in this one.The result is this trashy, idiotic, grotesque, ridiculous, STUPID movie! I wish there were negative rates so I could give this a MINUS TEN! Jason used to be spooky, now he\u00b4s just tedious. I wonder how the producers didn't saw that they were killing Jason (at least his spirit), transforming him in some kind of Ultraman or whatsoever. Watching Jason in \"Jason X\" was like watching Bela Lugosi in one of the Ed Wood pictures, and I'm really sorry for the actor who had to play his part.Now, If in \"Freddy vs Jason\", Krueger really wanted to eliminate Jason, he should have brought a copy of this movie and showed him instead of fighting. That would absolutely turn him down and lead him to suicide. After all, if the life-meaning of this monsters is it to scare, and all they can do is brought up some laughs...\u00bfis there really  a point in their existence?...\nPlease Jason, if there's at least a part of dignity in you, Kill yourself and stop making our lives miserables with your whinnings!",

That's the only reason I used to see them. So what's with this movie? Jason and his keeper end up frozen where a greedy scientist unleashes the horror of Jason on the 25th century.  The writing is imbecilic at best, but some of the deaths are pretty inventive. I keep wondering why the military didn't just expend a nuke on Camp Crystal Lake, but that's just me.  The acting is the 'best' of any of the Friday's for the most part. Lexa Doig (Andromeda from the TV show of the same name)is the star, the scientist frozen with old Jase. Kane Hodder, who really doesn't act, is back. He's played Jason more than any other stunt man.

So of course they all die, Rowan leads Jason down to the cryogenic freeze chamber where Jason stabs her and they get locked in the same room together for four hundred years. Amazingly enough that they won't be discovered by anyone who works there for four hundred years. So, the teenagers (who explore Earth 1) discover Rowan and Jason and take them on board their spaceship where both of them get defrosted and Jason starts up his old gig again. So the grunts get killed, the scientists, and all the other unimportant characters who are just added in the film for the body count, until there was three. Of course help comes to save them but can they open the door to the other ship? Heck no so they decide that the last grunt will go out into space and bypass the current flow of energy and the door opens. Rowan, KM, and KMs lover all get onto the ship ok, but the grunt, who really needs to think taking on Jason over, decides to take him on, one on one as the ship explodes. Great, Jason is dead right? Wrong. Of course Jason will be flying right towards the other ship right? As he is about to hit the other ship the Grunt comes out of nowhere and plows Jason over and heads towards Earth 2's atmosphere. Two campers see Jason and the grunt enter from the atmosphere and go and check it out, leaving the opening of a sequel on Earth 2.I can tell this much though, what a waste of a movie. First off, this movie was supposed to be made after the great Freddy vs Jason movie. It didn't make sense, now Jason is SuperJ, and then two years later he is normal Jason. Whatever though.

If you're a real fan of the genre, you've seen all the previous Jason , Freddy, and Michael Myers films (a promo for \"Halloween: Resurrection\" screened during \"Jason X\"), so how can you avoid this newest addition to the series? And fans won't be disappointed. \"Jason X\" delivers plenty of laughs, and plenty of teens you just hope will get killed good because they're so annoying. Killings include freezing a victims head to smash like glass, decapitations and plenty of impalings on Jason's famous machete.  There is even a scene where Crystal Lake is recreated with holograms and Jason gets to kill two bikini clad campers by banging their sleeping bags together (yes, with them in it). The audience with me had fun laughing out loud, so go with a group. If you like cleavage with your cleavers, don't miss \"Jason X,\" while we wait for Jason to meet Freddy, which is finally in production!",

            "content": "Again another good film ruined by James Isaac who took this from the original Friday The 13th franchise and ruined this for everybody.Since it came out, It was horrible. The film itself was not that great and also was not even scary at all.Evil Gets An Upgrade In the future a group of scientists decide to find Camp Crystal Lake hoping to study it closely. Upon knowing it they find Jason Voorhees and try to take him back to do some research about him and why he cannot be stopped. And because the Earth is contaminated and is inihatible. They take him aboard a spaceship to study him. Meanwhile a young scientist named Rowan decides to study Jason Voorhees and see if he's alive in one of the pods. But turns out that he awakes and gets out of the pod using his machete. But then both get frozen in the process.Now in the year 2455 Earth has become polluted to support life and humanity has moved to a new planet which is closest to all the other solar systems. Meanwhile a group of students find both Rowan and Jason frozen at the Camp Crystal Facility and try to get both frozen bodies onto their spaceship and after having moved to Earth 2. The students examine both bodies and put them in pods after finding out what happened. Later they examine and start unfreezing Rowan and tell her about what has happened to her. But then Jason is ressuracted and starts killing everybody on board of the ship while going on his killing spree.Now the first thing i would have to say is why would this take place in outer space. Because that's what the producers wanted it to take place there or maybe even take place on board the spaceship. Either way it's weird. Also why does Jason get an upgrade in this film, He is like normal in the Friday The 13th franchise. But in this movie he looks like a cyborg and a robot, And also his machete looks newer and better then his old one for some reason. I mean why was his machete upgraded and what happened. I don't get this either and for some reason what's with the mask. It just changes in every Friday The 13th film and that's it but for some reason this mask is new. Better, And is a lot more metal looking then his previous hockey mask. Could they have even managed to bring back the hockey mask from the previous films and put it on him. Wow talk about how bad the mask is, Also this movie does have a good amount of graphic killings like where Jason keeps killing and stabbing everybody on board with his machete while unleashing terror on Rowan and of course her friends. But also let's not forget how he kills also other people by also snapping their backs and of course stabbing them in the stomach which is just awful. It's not even scary and how pathetic can it really get when he just kills without warning and his victims make jokes. That is really not what it's about and besides the crew members on the ship never make any jokes when they are killed and the scares as you could say are just horrible because they don't scare their audience.The special effects in this film are just plain boring. From all the outer space scenes, It seems that the camera always manages to focus from one thing to another and it just keeps doing the same thing just to make everybody mad. And besides it's really cheesy because that's what they do that makes it awful.Also Kane Hodder was amazing as Jason Voorhees and he deserves the most credit. But in this film he does kill and yes of course that's what he does. And honestly he deserves the most respect because he was a great actor in this film and his talent and performance were spectacular here as well.But also the cast was just plain horrible. They never acted very well and certainly never did good too. Like the android who tries to kill Jason by shooting at him which never works out too well and she gets killed later on and the crew members don't react all too well in these situations. They just always play childish games and always make horrible jokes just to make you bored. Plus those jokes are cheesy and are not too funny at all as they just don't make them sound funny. Rowan on the other hand tries to stop Jason but he tries to kill her and also the other crew members get their backs broken. And their stomachs are stabbed by Jason's machete which kills them. They never react to well to situations and are the worst at acting and their performance as you could say is just plain horrible.Also the script looks as if was done by some the studio on purpose. It is just horrible to read and also is really horrible in my opinion. This film's script is very awful to read and in my case just plain ordinary. Also the script sounds if it was just horribly made and not the best way to read or even try to make it. They could have made the script a lot better then being garbage.This film is just plain junk, It's not scary, It's not creepy or disturbing, But it is very bloody and violent. And although Kane Hodder was amazing in this film. The film itself is just plain horrible and is ruined by yet James Isaac. So i advise you to please not watch this in the theaters and please don't spend your money to see this garbage. Trust me save your time and money but don't go out to see a horrible film that you will not enjoy.",

When i first heard about the 500 years in the future part I became disappointed and figured it wouldnt live up to the others, mostly because of the atmosphere change that Manhattan couldnt live up to. So time goes by and finally the movie is released, the opening scene made me laugh, not because it was bad, just because \"thats jason for ya,\" but it made me curious as to why the hell there was a research facility right on crystal lake, and how the hell did they manage to put jason in chains *SPOILER* i still wonder how the hell he got out of the chains *END SPOILER* It seemed the good ol government became interested in why Jason wont die, how hes able to regenerate body tissue, anf of course, jason breaks free only to be frozen moments later.At the point i decided that this movie sucked was when most of the deaths werent shown, about 30 people dies and only 10 of them were actually shown, and some were quite gruesome! the first death was the best, too bad the chick was so hot! I dont think ive ever seen a movie with character development as bad as this, even the main character, Rowan, you dont give a s*** about, as much as i wanted her to live i really couldve cared less, the only characters i felt for were Kay-Em and Brodski, Kay Em was hilarious and Brodski was such a tough guy.Just as the movie is nearing its end the funniest scene ive seen in a Jason movie yet comes up, with 2 topless chicks of course but i wont spoil anything else. Id say this scene saved the movie for any liking i gave it.One of the big reasons i didnt like this was because it was non stop killing, the movie never paused for any real dialouge, or any plot development for that matter.The atmosphere was another big problem, how can you do a Jason movie without a forest? I mean, even #8 pulled it off, but this movie lacked 'scariness', at no point was i ever scared or even intense about some chick about to lose her head. No suspense whatsoever, Jason didnt even toy with any of his victims.Also the death scenes were really crappy, there were only 4 or 5 that actually had any creativity, while every other jason movies death scenes are all quite creative, or most of them at least.As soon as Jason was upgraded it was really downhill from there, too bad the movie ended 15 minutes later. *SPOILER* he didnt even kill anyone! wtf *END SPOILER*Another weakness of the movie was the way Jason was killed, i can see why they did it, but i just hope it leads to a sequel.On a scale of 1-10, i give it a 6, because its a little better than it is stupid, i wouldve given it a 3 if it wasnt for that final scene of comic relief.All in all, this remains the worst Jason movie ive seen so far, but at least it was good for a few laughs.",

It wasn't scary (heck they haven't been scary since I was 12).  But it was enjoyable.  And the way the movie pokes fun at the whole series near the end (in the hyper-reality room) is very nice.  Quite humorous and shows that the makers had a good time.\nPerhaps my want for another installment has blinded me to good quality but I was first in line to see this movie when it came out.

SPOILERS Apart from Jason goes to hell all other fridays were produced in the 80's and it shows. 8 Episodes of Friday the 13th delivered a lot of script recycling and brought us one of the most memorable icons in horror of all time: Jason Voorhees. 2 of the previous 9 movies tried to be different (5 & 9) and they both failed at that, so the production team was warned before changing anything radical to the standard Jasonmovie storyline which is: Jason resurrects, wreaks havoc on nearby camping teenagers who have sex and do drugs and gets killed by one or two teenagers who still have there virginity. However, in this post-Scream-era the productionteam got a multimillion dollar budget and changed, despite of being warned, a lot to the concept. Does it work this time: Yes! Jason isn't resurrected this time, he's captured and awaiting to be cryogenically frozen (the previous sequels pointed out that he just simply can' be killed). Something goes wrong and he escapes, temporarily 'cause after a few kills he gets trapped in the Freezer with the lead heroine and they both become frozen. Time flies by as we go 400 years into the future and Jason and the heroine are defrosted on a spaceship with teenagers(!) and a dozen marines. From that point it's just another Friday the 13th but this time in space and with CGI-special effects. Teenagers who have sex get killed, all the marines get killed, people who try to make money of Jason get killed, so far no surpise. The only surprise we get is UberJason; half robot, half organic. This is a nice addition (must admit I didn't think it was cool on the moviestills, but in action he remains Jason, only with a new look) Now, the lack of suprises don't really matter cause you get what you expect. The formula works perfectly in space and seeing Jason take on an entire team of marines is something else than just defendless teens. However this movie excells in the same way part 6 excelled: humour. Jason's kills are laughable (he's screwed) and the remarks the crew make are hilarious (I don't think he's out there. Well, why don't you stick your head out and peak then). The retroscene is also brilliant and hilarious, and is one of the many proofs that we all know that this is the 10th installment in a slasher movieseries. I really liked this Jason movie and it is one of the best out of the series, if not the best. My Personal faves in the Friday installment: pt. 6 and Jason XNote: it might be useful for people who are new to Jason to rent a couple of the old movies, so they can catch all the selfspoofjokes (especially the retroscene). But beware if you do: all the old movies are pre-cgi and big budget moviemaking.",

Hell, when Jason first started slaughtering horny teens at Camp Crystal Lake, no one could have predicted that years later he would be off into space (or even Manhattan for that matter).Enter Jason X (no relation to Malcolm) the tenth film in the Friday the 13th series (with the \"X\" doing double duty here as not only the 10, but also the unknown, or more accurately Uber Jason who shows up for the last reel).Kane Hodder returns for his forth (and to date, last) time portraying the hockey masked killer. Once again, he embraces the role and gives Jason a little personality under the mask and makeup.Although this movie was shot on film, it was one of the first features to be totally transferred to HD video. This allowed for a quick turnaround for the numerous digital effects (most which look horribly dated) and also for some cool colour timings that give the picture a brighter comic book look. Of course, as with every Jason movie, there are a couple of memorable kills - the stand out in this one being the head freeze/table slam, which I simply call \"smash-face\".Unfortunately, the film's pacing is horrible. It starts well, introduces our main batch o' characters, but then abandons them to focus on a bunch of unnecessary grunts, who suffer mundane deaths. This drags the film down completely - not to mention the whole thing reeks of a bad Aliens ripoff. Fortunately, the film eventually gets back to the original crop of victims, I mean characters, and has a few cool tricks up his sleeve. As for the music, Harry Manfredini's opening credit theme is great, however, the rest of his score is uninspired, and doesn't even seem to match the action on screen.But what about this so called SUPER JASON? Well, Uber Jason is cool, but I believe his new look would probably wear out its welcome after another film or so, as the iconic (read: Old School) Jason would be missed.Fans are seemingly split on this instalment (lets face it, fans are split on every entry in this franchise, which is what makes it so darn fun to talk about). However, I believe that this one stands above parts 7, 8 and 9. Yes It's stupid, but its somewhat fun nevertheless. Admittedly, the filmmakers should've gone \"full comic book\" given the premise, and that (mixed with the bad score) is what keeps this one from being one of the best.For a more in-depth dissection of this film, check out our Friday the 13th (Jason X) podcast here: http://tgif13.podbean.com/e/jasonx/",

There are some pretty creative kills in this one, but a lot of strangely uninspired ones too.  With the obvious exception of Robert \"Fred Krueger\" Englund, Kane Hodder is the king of all slasher actors (actually he's the only man to portray the silent stalker for more than one sequel, and he's still damn good).  The film was shot in Canada, so David Cronenberg drops in for a cameo.  There's a funny scene at the end...I won't spoil it, although someone else probably already has on this site.  The new Jason is pretty cool, but we don't need a Jason X2 (and not just because it sounds like a Mega Man game).  If New Line feels inspired to eke out another Friday after Freddy vs. Jason, then it'd be best if they return the series to its roots.  Still, Jason X is a pretty good time-waster for fans of this eternal franchise.",

Putting Jason in space was the best idea since he went to Manhattan in Part 8. Future settings leave so much potential for backstory in later movie. We can find out how Jason was captured, how he became a test subject, etc. In terms of this being a horror movie, well its not really a horror movie as such, more of a Sci-Fi/Action/Thriller(with an unstoppable killer who just happens to be Jason Vorhees). The atmosphere is just right and Kane Hodder is in top form as Jason. Here we have someone who enjoys playing Jason Vorhees.Kane Hodder makes Jason more than he's classed as being. As well as killing anything in his way, his Jason in this film is cunning, ruthless and pretty p***sed off. The deaths in this film are also quite creative(especially the bit were Jason freezes then shatters a poor girls face, and the bit were the Marine is impaled on the giant screw)The best is the unprecedented number of kills just in the beginning(i think its like 7 at once)SPOILER ALERT: what the hell is with the ending??? I mean Jason has been known to survive anything but this is ridicilous. I mean even if he was Uber-Jason the vaccum of space should surely have killed him, but then adding the whole ending were he re-entering the planet is just pushing credibility, even in this type of film.In total, this a worthy addition to the Friday the 13th franchise and is great entertainment for all.",

            "content": "Jason X can be summarized by one simple word:  FUNWhile hardcore fans of the Friday series may find themselves a tad disappointed with this installment, it opens itself up to a much broader audience than simply horror groupies.  This is because Jason X is not a straight-up horror film.  It's a brew made up of one part horror, one part action, a cup of sci-fi, and a dash of Arnold Schwarzenegger.Highly creative and graphically violent deaths should keep the horror fan in everyone entertained while the hunter vs. the hunted premise keeps the action element in high gear.  One of the most notable features of Jason X is the finesse in which it pokes fun at itself.  The mastery of this is akin to Evil Dead 2 with enough humor to be subtle and entertaining, but not over-the-top ala Army of Darkness.  The humor also wonderfully combines inside jokes that Friday fans will get with fun moments that everyone can enjoy.I have watched this film with six different people, many of whom are different kinds of moviegoers.  Everyone found their own personal times to cheer, laugh, and scream.  I really believe there are elements of Jason X that almost everyone can enjoy, you just have to go in seeking some enjoyment.Personally, I have never been a major Jason fan.  I believe Halloween to be a much more frightening experience than Friday the 13th, and consider Jason movies to be for a less sophisticated audience.  Jason X, however, brings its sophistication up a notch and introduces wit to the series for the first time.  It is also by far the best film making the series has seen, from well executed cinematography to an excellent score that sounds like it was lifted straight out of the Hellraiser series.Jason X is one of the rare truly universal scary movies.  It delivers enough for horror fans, but it also has enough other elements so that it is also entertaining for more mainstream moviegoers.  Despite this more universal appeal, Jason X also contains some of the most brutal violence the masked one has ever committed.Timing is executed wisely in Jason X.  Right when things are getting too scary, some humor is tossed in.  When things get too light-hearted, a dark and bloody sequence will be upcoming.  I give Jason X high marks based on its brilliant death sequences, enjoyable humor, and it actually has some decent acting to boot.I may be alone in this, but I consider Jason X to be the best in the Friday the 13th series...a welcome addition, especially after the abysmal Jason Goes To Hell.The Jason X DVD is a great package containing 2 documentaries and an excellent feature that allows you to skip the plot of the movie and watch only the kill sequences.  A+ job on the DVD.",

The Truth.com better not find out about this statistic, it could put them out of business. * Fans of the series will appreciate some of the formula elements that you expect from a \"Friday\" picture:      - The Forwarning: Rowan, the woman who was frozen along with    Jason, tells of the numerous ways in which they tried to kill Jason and yet when Jason is on the lose she is assured by the ships optimistic professor that there is nothing to worry about. - Inventive slaughters: Jason dunks a girls head into   nitroglycerin, then smashes it into several pieces against a wall.                                                                     - Horny Teenagers: Since when are science students this hot,   dressed in clothes that would make Madonna blush and excused from lab in order to fornicate.                                           - False Death of Jason: I've seen Jason come back from being hung,   axed and macheted to the head, electricuted, drowned, drenched with toxic waste and sent to hell, but I never I thought I would        see him get up after he had his head blown off in this one.* Yes, this movie sets up for a sequel, but when are we going to see Freddy vs. Jason?* With regards to the special effects: They Suck!. Now that everybody is using computer graphics, it's time to limit there use just for the films that can afford to use them well. The space scenes in this movie are on par with the worst of the original Star Trek series. This gives more evidence that what Tom Savini was able to do back in the original \"Friday\" was a real breakthrough and it is too bad that this film is connected to that film.",

He's big, he's stupid, he uses a machete and whatever tools he can find. What's not to love about this big lug? Oh that's right, his last four movies sucked!!!!When I heard they were putting Jason in space I was upset but the director said in an article that the fans should enjoy it. He was aware of how stupid the idea sounded but felt like he could do something with it. So I said, \"Okay. I'll give it a chance.\" I would have been better off if the director had said, \"Eat lye. It's not so bad.\"This film takes place five hundred years after the last one. A group of scientists were cryogenically freezing Jason and in the imminent melee that follows whenever a group of scientist attempt to do something stupid, Jason and one of his detractors are frozen together. Five hundred years later they are thawed out and more destruction by Jason ensues.I must say, the special effects that follow are top notch and some of the performances are quite good (although not good enough to get a mention here). But, while everything seemed solid the film as a whole still seemed to be a sanitized version of the same old thing. Yes, they do find a way for Jason to just open up his own special form of savagery on a number of people but for what?After sitting through this I realized that my Jason was gone. Any interesting idea (3-D, raising him from the grave) are now gone to the way of modernized crap. It's better looking crap, wrapped in a prettier package, but no matter what you do with it, it's still crap. A poor idea should be left alone. The director must have felt he was better than he really is if he thought he could make something useful out of this mess.It's not a good time, it's not a hoot, and it's certainly not thought provoking.

But thats fine with me, in my opinion, to truly enjoy horror movies, you cant always take them seriously.Finally the series has caught on, and has also stopped taking itself seriously. Some of the jokes we're lame, and came at insanely idiotic moments but at least they were trying to be funny. The acting was...why even ask?

Now, I'm not sure if the bootleg is a rough cut of the film or what, since I never saw it in theaters. I have to say that it was good. It was a nice change from the usual theme of Jason running around campgroundish places and killing people. Some of the death scenes were very creative (Adrienne, Kicker, and Janessa, to name a couple). The acting wasn't too terrific. Lexa Doig and Lisa Ryder were allright. I read a rough draft of the script online that had Kay-Em 14 as very perverted and humerous. I have to say I was disappointed at the lack of this in the film. Melyssa Ade truly shined here. She has some great acting skills (and her cleavage wasn't too bad either). Melody Johnson (Kinsa) came off as very annoying, and I think it took her too long to die. At first, I was a little sketchy about the space stuff, but when it comes down to it, this is still Jason at his best.

The dialog is really, really bad. eg. \"Why don't you stick your head out the door and see if Jason's gone?\" 3. The weapons in this movie are very disappointing.

There's a lot of stuff in the movie that doesn't make sense, like: i) why didn't the guy who got impaled through the chest twice die? I know they had nanotechnology to revive him, but it took them so long to get to him, he would've been dead. ii) how did Jason's mask stay on this face throughout the movie after the doctor cut it off? iii) why did they save the really good weapons til the end? iv) why did they leave Jason just sitting in the nanotech machine, knowing it might come alive and revive him? v) why wasn't Jason blown into outer space with the rest of the ship that got blown off? 6. The ending is just so incredibly dumb when the guy flies in with the jet pack and scoops Jason away 7. Why are there 3 survivors at the end? Most movies in this series, there's only 1 survivor. 8.

Upon seeing JASON X, I expected to see a plethora of possibilities in its sci-fi setting in the vein of a parody since the scare element has long been unavailing in this type of horror. Then again, they couldn't put any entertainment value in the last nine tries why would the tenth be any different? The movie starts out in the near future with Jason Voorhies being kept in Camp Crystal Research Facility where he is being prepared to be cryogenicized until it can be figured out how to kill him. He escapes impoundment not even 10 minutes into the movie and kills everyone in sight except for the scientist who throws him and herself into the freeze chamber. They are discovered a few centuries later by a group of nubile students who inhabit a spacestation,which is where most of this movie will take place. They manage to thaw out the scientist and her arch enemy. Bad idea. Jason soon awakes to find his machete and more salacious teens to slaughter. The gory killings retain the same style as before and there are a couple of funny scenes that poke fun at slasher cliches. I saw this film at a midnight showing. The audience consisted mostly of kids who weren't even born when FRIDAY THE 13TH first came out. Maybe that's why the studio thought that this movie could work. But they can't even get that right. They can't even spoof the right movie! You'd think that after SCREAM, I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER and URBAN LEGEND etc., that JASON  X could at least take full advantage of trying to top all those flicks by having its own series to freshen up scares and laughs. But no,it mostly goes the way of ripping off the ALIEN movies. The last couple of scenes even directly rip-off from ALIEN RESURRECTION. Shame on me for giving a bad slasher series a tenth chance.",

And Jason X delivers: a high body count with some classic (the machete) and some creative killings (ever seen someone getting screwed?), nice looking chicks and, of course, an \"unbeatable\" Jason Voorhees. Some funny lines, a cool sergeant, and an interesting retro scene add up to this. The movie is set in the year 2455 aboard a space ship. It delivers what you expect from Jason, using elements from the Friday 13th series and movies like Alien, the Hellraiser movies or The Terminator. Although it's certainly one of the better Friday 13th movies, on an absolute scale of 1-10 I'd give it a 6.",

They might as well stand in line and say what their good for and let Jason kill them.

I only hope this Kirt dude can get Jason down as well as Mr Hodder!!If you were expecting a sci fi action, go watch NemesisAs a general movie, for people new to the franchise, I'd give this 8/10For Friday Fans 9.9/10So stop be so negative, and enjoy this mayhem for what it is, erm.. mayhem!!",

Jason is in some weird lab and gets loose somehow (yeah, like in Jason Goes to Hell, I guess we must forget parts 1-9) killing people in a non gory fashion (how late 90's) and gets frozen. Now it's 455 years later and a group of students on a space ship find Jason who they unfreeze like a bunch of schmucks and now he's loose, killing them all.There is NO gore at all, less than any of previous films and hardly any nudity that us men love to see in our Friday the 13th films. There is non stop comedic one-liners that must be put in all modern horror films, thus re-enforcing the fact that the horror genre is dead (thanks to Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer). Is the audience now that stupid that they must need comedic scenes after all scary scenes? I actually think that moviegoers are getting more moronic as time goes by.I am glad the film makers spat in the faces of all 80's Friday the 13th films and it's fans. Watching this bootleg version with all the \"gore\" intact (what a joke, go see an action film now if you want gore) made me realize that because of all the hip young actors making stupid jokes and not showing their privates, this film will gross a ton of money. Too bad, this just makes me want to go back and look at all the Paramount 80's Friday the 13th films. All of a sudden, Jason Takes Manhattan is a masterpiece",

All he wanted was his machete back!\" 5) When Jason's in the simulated world (and it's the camp, omg, how funny is that?) and sees these two topless girls in sleeping bags, and I'm thinkin, you know, it's JASON; maybe he's gonna get some. But no. Instead, he starts beating the one girl in the sleeping bag by means of the other girl in the sleeping bag. HE BEATS A GIRL WITH THE OTHER GIRL!!!

The black guy who never dies flies after Jason. Knocks him off his course. And they fly off to \"dissintigrate\" in the Earth's atmosphere. 7) Did you think that would kill Jason? You were wrong.

Once you realize that Jason survives absolutely ANY and ALL forms of destruction imaginable, it simply becomes an endless cycle of the same 5-minute segment of killed/revived, killed/revived, killed/revived... ad nauseum infinitum. Once you realize that all the characters could be reanimated at any moment (though, most stupidly of all, the protagonists introduce this tech in the beginning, and then promptly forget about it for most of the remaining ninety-something minutes) you stop caring about whether they get killed or not. Finally, the vast majority of the gore scenes come from the seen-that-many-times-before collection, so even originality is out through the window - or airlock, in this case.The saddest part is that the special F/X are generally very good (i.e. ranging from TV-level-serviceable to feature-film-quality - hence my rating of 3 stars), and the cast (composed mostly from the crew of the TV series 'Andromeda') features several talented - or at least visually appeasing - actors and actresses.

Then you've got a poor acting cast who just scream and think their so hard by  saying stuff like \"I've killed Jason\" oh what a happy ending!!! In all the Friday 13th movies I've supported Jason against all the dumb nitwitt's who think they can out smart him. I'll definatley check out Freddy VS. Jason because it'll be better than Jason X. I'll give this crappy movie a 0/10!",

The score was terrible by Harry Manfredini, and I know that he could do better.  The music from the original Friday The 13th's were great, creepy, and scary.  It sounds better when he uses real orchestrations instead of cheap synthesized music, like on \"Jason Goes To Hell.\"  The whole plot of this film was rediculous, and I thought it was a bad cast.  The acting wasn't too great either, and this film wasn't hardly scary or suspenseful. It was like a joke, and made the Jason series look bad, in my opinion.  The special effects weren't at all believeable.  Overall, this film was very disappointing and I can't stop thinking of all the bad things found in this film.  I think the filmmmakers should have been more serious in making this film, and not be so comedic, because that ruins it all.  Jason fans wanted to see something new and exciting, but this sure wasn't, I was very disappointed and if I knew the film would have been that bad, I wouldn't have even wasted my time going to the theatres...I give this film a D+, and on a scale from 1 to 10, a 3.",

It's been a long time since I saw Jason on the big screen and I welcomed his return. The body count was high in the film (in the teens), which was very important to me, although I still cannot understand the sex scenes. Personally I rather see a girl get mutilated then screwed in a horror flick, but that is the personality of the series. The SFX in the movie are great and yes, there are some funny parts to the film and even some nostalgia. I give it a 6.5 out of 10.",

Outside of him everyone else here is pretty woeful, delivering some awful dialogue from an already stupid concept of putting Jason in space. The one thing you need from your lead female in this film is the ability to be the victim to at least sell the fear. Lexa Doig is an actress of limited range and this was clearly beyond her and the writing for her did not help.On top of that we are treated to some pretty awful effects work, the cgi elements are bad I have seen better effects work in Syfy originals.The final insult to fans of the series is Uber Jason, the Jason upgrade that appears towards the end of the film. He is simply ridiculous, a silver masked, reddish eyed cyborg.I understand this film is not trying to be a hardcore entry in the series but in the attempt to make it extra campy they soared passed that goal right into stupid and bad.",

Murder and mayhem of this sort quickly becomes monotonous. After a brief setup, Jason starts his rampage. One-by-one, the characters are picked off, until, at the end, a plucky heroine or manly hero dispatches him (temporarily). Most of Jason X takes place on a spaceship which to me is wasted opportunity to take the series into better directions (straight camp).",

What we have is this sorry catagory of movies that includes \"Critters 4\" and is culminated in the awfulness that we call \"Jason X\".\nThe following sections of writing contains some SPOILERS! Yes, I said SPOILERS! So if you have yet to see this movie, and for some very sick reason you plan on watching the \"horror\", please stop reading here because there are SPOILERS ahead.To me, there were only three slightly entertaining parts to the entire movie: 1- the opening violence seen where he brakes loose and goes on the best all-round rampage of the whole move. 2- the part where he kills the doctor that was restoring him. When Jason put her head in the liquid nitrogen type substance and then preceeded to smash her frozen face on the table only to have it completely shatter, I thought that was the best use of gore in the film. 3- the sleeping bag scene. That was absolutely the funnist part of the movie, I fell over laughing. It was great, but it did not happen often enough to make \"Jason X\" worth seeing again because there were to many logical mistakes to not get upset with.Like:First of all, the whole \"field trip to Earth 1\" is as dumb an idea as anybody with 14 braincells could come up with. Then, what do you think the odds are that the \"field trip\" happened to discover, of all things possible, the cryogenically frozen remains of Jason. So what do you think they do? A - leave the frozen man alone. or B - take him aboard their spaceship. Guess what? They thought no harm in choice B. Once on the ship, they actually run a DNA test and discover they identity of the ice man as Jason... and they defrost and reanimate him ANYWAY!! How stupid could they be? What did they expect? It does not matter because those idiots died the aweful deaths they deserved. Then, why not end this terrible movie with such a ridiculous finale that it leaves normal people cursing at the director? Once half of the ship blows up and Jason is floating in space, with NO OXYGEN might I add, he is somehow making his way toward the remaining part of the ship with the survivors, when he is just about to come in contact with the ship, a soldier that Jason maimed comes floating from Jason's side, also WITHOUT OXYGEN, and tackles him into the atmosphere where everything burns up EXCEPT the Mask.To summerize, the 11 entertaining minutes of the movie are not even close to making up for the rest of this disasterous project. All things said and done, please, I beg of you, DO NOT SEE \"JASON X\" EVER!!!!!!",

The acting is absolutley awful... the cast is more irritating than entertaining. Whats more, the plot is nothing more than stupid. I rented this film for a laugh thinking it would be a semi-scary slash-fest, but no. The film has no atmosphere and would be more scary if it featured the rug-rats.Something this film seriously lacks (apart from a good cast and a good script), is atmosphere. Horror movie??? nah, its trying to be a comedy full of unfunny one liners and slapstick. Really you couldn't care less if someone died or not because of the bad acting!!Another stupid American horror franchise flick gone wrong... when will they learn?!0.5/10",

After nearly a nine year absence, the previous film was released in August of 1993, Jason Voorhees makes his return to the world of the living, at least for about 90 minutes.The film starts off with some cool opening credits as we're led through the inner workings of Jason's body as he's having some tests done on him. Somehow, and it's never revealed, the government has managed to capture him and seeing as he can't be killed they've decide to have him cryogenically frozen until they can figure out what to do with him. However just as Rowan(Lexa Doig) is about to prep the cryostasis chamber Dr. Wimmer(David Cronenberg in a cameo) informs her that he doesn't want him frozen because he wants to move him to a different facility so they can conduct more research on him. By now Jason has escaped and kills them all except for Rowan who fights him off and manages to get him in the cryostasis chamber. She gets too close and Jason stabs her through the inches thick steel door with his machete(yeah right!). Cut to over 400 years later with a group of students on a field trip where they discover Jason and Rowan's perfectly preserved bodies. Their teacher has the bodies brought back on board their ship so they can be brought back to life and what follows is your standard stalk and kill sequences.Jason may have met his match in Kay-Em 14(Lisa Ryder) however, an android, who gives him his best fight yet. She riddles him with bullets, gives him a few roundhouse kicks and riddles him with more bullets before blowing off an arm, a leg and leaving Jason with about ten percent of his head. Jason's body regenerates and he comes back with a steel leg, arm and mask and is now known as Uber Jason. Uber Jason doesn't last long however before being sucked out into space and burning up upon re-entry leaving only his mask.This is your standard slasher flick with stupid teenagers running around getting killed in various gory ways. The writing is bad, the acting is the same and the special effects in this film, and there's plenty, make this film look like it was shot with a very low budget. It makes you miss the previous films in the series. If you're not a fan of this series I'd recommend you rent or buy Alien which is a much better movie and essentially the same thing with the exception of Jason substituting for the aliens. If you are a fan of the series however you probably know what to expect already and will probably enjoy it as I did.",

I say that some 15 or 16 are appropriate in the modern era, as established by Jason takes Manhattan, for example. I didn't like the jokey manner of things. I expect a more dark and grim theme. It often ruined things for the very victims of murder to make the quips about the way in which they were killed.The so-called UberJason was just too goofy. He seemed cool in publicity shots, but comes off like the villain from Power Rangers during the film. Kay Em, Rowan, and the sergeant were all cool. I could have done without the rest, but that's always the case. It's lucky that even three characters come out likable. Chronenberg was kind of cool too.The highest budgeted feature of the series to day showed where the money was spent, and it seemed like it was mostly scifi effects, and not the killings as I would have wished.

Rather it turns out bland, boring and lifeless, much like Jason himself. Perhaps his age is starting to show, because even as the new \"improved\" Jason he has the same old MO. There are a few interesting moments.  The female android was amusing at times, Lexa Doig is cute, and Jason in a VR 80's Camp Crystal Lake scene *is* rather funny.  But 8 minutes of film just don't make up for the lack of entertainment the other 70 minutes+ do not deliver. I was bored beyond belief for long stretches of this movie.",

            "content": "Going into the theatre I knew that I was not about to view an Oscar caliber film\u0085and that the way a Friday the 13th film should be!  Horror films are supposed to be somewhat cheesy, and not have overblown dramatic performances.  They are supposed to give a good enough performance that makes you care about them, but not so much that you are crushed when they get killed.  The only character that you are supposed to like that much are the ones that either survive, or get killed saving their friends and kill the bad guy.  Everything is not supposed to make sense.  How many times have you ever personally encountered a superhuman killing machine, like Jason Voorhees?  Not many, and if you did, you would have probably been killed. That being said, Jason X was a really good horror movie, and it stayed very true to the F13 series in many ways.  There was constant action, a little T&A, some classic F13 gore, and a whole lot of fun.  Oh yeah, there were also some really cool death sequences, and the filmmakers really did a good job taking advantage of the projected technological advances when plotting out some of the deaths.  The best part of the movie was the distraction that Kay-Em 14 sets for Jason in the hologram room.  Not only does it take Jason back to his roots, but it is very comical.  Oh yeah, and at the end there was a very cool sequence that makes me believe that there will be another sequel, but it will be in a Camp Crystal Lake type setting.  Let me just say that I loved this movie.  It is definitely not the worst movie in the F13 series (that honor would got to either 5 or 8.)  However, it is not the best movie in the series either, I don't think that I could make that distinction, because too many of them are really good.  It really was very true to the F13 series; only it took place in space.  There were only two things that I disliked about this film: 1) the sequence following Kay-Em 14's upgrade, and 2) the cheesy one-liners that plagued certain parts of the movie.  However, if you are a fan of the series, neither of those aspects will prevent you from enjoying the film!  Like I said, it was not an Oscar caliber film, but if you go in expecting that quality of film, then you are not familiar with the series!  I am a huge fan of the series, I own all 9 films, so my opinion is very biased.  Being a big fan of the series I give it an 8.5/10.  With one point getting knocked off for Kay-Em 14's upgrade, and half a point getting knocked off for the one-liners.",

This is not a film to make you wow at the writing, it is a fun, high-end campy slasher film with cool ways people die.  That's it. End of story.  The movie never attempted to be anything more than it is and means everything it does. Someone once defined \"quality\" as the creation of something that does exactly what you want it to do.

They're the type of films that could work but fail because not enough care and thought had gone into them. JASON X is definetely one of them. This movie just plain sucks! If your looking for a horror film then look elsewhere, because this film has no virtually horror in it whatsoever. Just a lame excuse for a sci-fi movie. This has the weakest atmosphere that I have ever seen in my life! There is no fear of dread and no suspense that the other Jason films had. Did these people even watch the other 9 movies at all or did they make this up as they went along? A better director is sorely needed here because James Isaac does a terrible job behind the camera. The actors aren't any better: Lexa Doig doesn't cut it as the heroine, Lisa Ryder is just annoying as hell as the android, Kane Hodder looks rusty behind the mask because he just doesn't have the usual magic here he once had (although \u00dcber Jason in his metallic form looks really cool), and David Cronenberg is utterly wasted in a pathetic cameo at the beginning. Even worse is that the kills are weak and watered down. Only good death scene is when Jason freezes a girl's face in liquid Nitrogen and then smashes it on the desk. Other than that he mostly breaks necks here. Even the scene where Jason repeats an old kill from a previous film by sealing a girl in her sleeping bag and wacking her against a tree is too soft! This film also sorely fails in the sci-fi/horror genre as it doesn't mix either together to good effect. See ALIEN as to how sci-fi and horror can be mixed well without sacrificing either genre. Even the film that had Pinhead in space is 100 times better than this one! Like I said, this all could have worked. But it becomes a bad joke instead. Watch the other films instead. This one is an insult to the hardcore Jason fans. The writing is on the wall, it's time for Jason to retire.",

            "content": "First off, I've been a huge Friday the 13th fan for many many years.  And I was one of the few people in the theater who was old enough to remember all of them.  (I am 29 years old...a lot of 16 year olds who said they are excited to see Jason 'X'.  I didn't have the heart to tell them it is really Jason Ten and that the X is a Roman numeral for it being the 10th Friday the 13th movie.  Ah, the state of education these days...)Anyway, before I saw the movie, I didn't like the idea of going 450 years into the future for killing in space.  I am an old fashioned guy who likes Crystal Lake and the cabins.  But I was pleasantly surprised by the movie. There were some interesting killings, some good laughs, and some good nostalgia (mentioning earlier films to a degree.)However, I guess the Friday the 13th series is no longer a horror genre. This movie, I would not call a horror film...but a Sci-Fi slasher picture. There wasn't much scarry in the film.  Unlike the earlier films where there was \"suspense\" and even though I knew someone would die, I would jump from fear when Jason showed up.  There was none of that in Jason X.  And I think I discovered why...In earlier films, Part II, Part III, and Part IV (we don't include part I and part V since it wasn't Jason), Jason was \"killable\" and more of a \"man\". So Jason had to be sneaky, like a boogie man who lived in the shadows. People doubted if he really existed and was just a wives tale.  (Kinda like Mr. Snufalupagus (sp?) on Sesame Street...at least in the old days.  I haven't watched Sesame Street in a long time, but people tell me that everyone sees him now.)  This made him scarry.Nowadays, everyone sees him and knows he is \"unkillable\".  Hence, the horror suspense is not there.  He's just a constant machine who doesn't hide and doesn't seem human.  (The human characteristic was the best part in earlier movies.)Now, back to Jason X.  If this had been a pure sci-fi movie, without the slasher stuff, it would have made a great sci-fi movie.  I would've loved to investigate and discover what occured over the past 450 years of mankind. Being 450 years into the future bring up interesting technological inventions, and my personal opinion is that Jason X handled them somewhat realistically.  (Others may disagree.)  Unlike typical movies in the future where they have inventions like time travel, worm hole creation, etc.  This movie tried to be more realistic.  It would not surprise me that in 450 we have great virtual reality and the ability to re-generate body tissue or the ability to stop an cut quickly and reattach a limb at a later time.  I like the cryogenic side too.The beginning, with Jason chained up, and then switching places with the guard and killing everyone I thought was too predictable of an opening and started on a bad foot (luckily the predictable stuff ended there for a while.)  The only other badly predictable part was Jason coming back to life during the autopsy.  We saw this already at the beginning of Part IV and a somewhat similar thing in the beginning of Part VI and Part IX.  But I guess there was no other way to do it.  Except if Jason was left alone and he came back to life.  I would have loved to see a human side to Jason where he is confused by being in the future and not on earth.  But oh well.I thought the characters were interesting in this one.  They were the most interesting people since Tommy Jarvis in Part VI.  The virtual reality camp crystal lake at the end was perfect!!!  And the two topless young girls to occupy Jason were hilarious.  \"We gonna drink and smoke pot and maybe have some sex.  We'll just be in the sleeping bags right now.\"  That was classic and great comedy relief and a great tribute to earlier movies.  I was expected one of two things when the Virtual Reality camp crystal lake.  I was hoping that they would VR Pamela Vorhees (Jason's mother) to the campsite.  It would have made Jason more human again, and we know deep down Jason was a \"Mama's Boy\".  The other thing they could have done was VR either Tommy Jarvis from part VI or Adrienne King from Part I & II or others from earlier films to confuse or occupy Jason.  But they went for the more commic relief.  Plus, I never mind seeing a couple of young girl's breasts.The ending promised our typical setup for another movie on Planet Earth 2 (I assume) at a campsite.  It was expected, but done well.  If you're a fan of the genre or just the Friday the 13th movies, I would suggest going to see it for 2 reasons. 1) It's a pretty entertaining and interesting movie. 2) If it does well enough at the box office, we are certain the see the long awaited movie \"Freddy -vs- Jason\".  New Line Cinema has been working on the project for a while, but are waiting to see how well Jason X does in the theaters.In future Friday movies, I'd love to see a \"prequel\" of sorts.  Explain what happened to Jason's father.  What happened from the 1950s until the early 1980s when Jason started killing in Part II.  And so on.My Friday The 13th Ranking System.  (Best to Worst)1) Part VI: Jason Lives.  Great story, great characters.2) Part I: The original...but no Jason until the end.  But great suspense.3) Part IX: The director's cut is so gruesome, but great story.4) Jason X: Yes, this actually makes it up to #4 on the list.5) Part III: The 3-D was campy and dated.  But this in my mind was the scariest of all the Friday the 13th movies.  I saw this when I was 10 years old and I couldn't sleep for weeks after.  I just kept seeing that scene where Chris (who was one of the cutest Friday girls ever) after she hangs Jason walks up to his dangling corpse and Jason awakes, lifting his hockey mask, and flashing that dimented smile.6) Part IV: The beginning of Tommy Jarvis!!!7) Part VII: I didn't get into the whole Tina thing.8) Part II: Basically a re-hashing of Part I with Jason doing the killing instead.9) Part VIII: Jason takes Manhattan was terrible.  I assumed this was the end of the Friday series.  Luckily New Line bought the rights from Paramount and Sean S. Cunningham came back.  This movie was so bad that Sean S. Cunningham started Part IX to begin after Part VII and just ignored the 8th. (I read also that Sean S. Cunningham said Part IX really starts after Part II...because he didn't like any of the sequels after the 2nd.  Hence that's why we don't hear any reference to Tina or Tommy Jarvis in the last two movies.)  This movie was terrible.  Jason didn't end up in New York until the very end of the movie.  The New Yorkers, one of which I am, were so cliche.  And I never saw Nuclear Waste in the sewers. Hmmmmm.10) Part V: One reason.  No Jason.  Stupid plot of some guy killing like Jason for revenge.  Only good scene was the part where the guy is killed in the Port-A-Potty.",

Of course, true Jason fans want him to kill everyone, but I think even a non-horror fan would want Jason to kill everyone, as well, if only to put an end to the horrible acting by everyone on the spacecraft. 3 out of 10.",

Upon seeing it for the 2nd time I realized how horrible this movie was. First off Jason in space? We have all learned from the past that space slashers don't work. If you don't believe me watch Hellrasier: Bloodlust or Leprechaun in space. There were some cool death scenes and this movie had a huge over the top body count. The character Kinsa was annoying with her endless whining and crying. The acting was horrible, and that one guy who was hooking up with the robot looked like an elf version of Matthew Perry. On the other hand Lexa Doig was great! Her character was kind of blah, but she was the best looking heroine of all the friday the 13th films. Anyway Jason X is the worst friday the 13th film of the past 9. I think I liked part 5 better than this one and that one sucks too. Don't pay money to see this movie. Jason died after Manhattan, and new line should have just made Freddy vs. Jason. I heard that movie won't get made unless Jason X does well. That sucks since I went on saturday at the night showing with about 15 people in the theatre.",

            "content": "Spoiler Alert Okay this may be pretty crazy of me, but I'm going to review this as a stand-alone flick. It's been done before, how a movie will 'spin off' from another, and have so little to do with it's predecessors that changing the name will attract new audiences. So, I figured that the most fair way to review this movie is as \"Jason X\" from a non biased view, not just as \"The Friday 13th part 9/10 that never was\".The start of this movie warmly welcomes anybody, weather they have seen the original Friday 13th movies or not. Jason Vorhees is a crazed serial killer whose almost invulnerable body and immunity to death has been discovered and is being researched - this is all you have to know to understand this movie, and it's made clear in a pretty detailed way by the doctors and miliatary men at the start. No references to the other movies or Jason's mother are made. A wise move seeing that a lot of audience of the appropriate age for this film would be too young to remember the original franchise.So what can you do to someone who won't die and, by the looks of things, doesn't talk either? Jason has been held captive for quite a while so it seems, doctors and scientists performing all kinds of tests and research on his body. The intention is to cryogenically freeze Jason until there is something they can do with him, but, of course, things don't turn out quite as planned. After beginning a true Jason style massacre. Up to this point it could have been the so called \"Friday 13th part 9/10\".Next, however, comes the twist, and the change of style setting this apart from the Friday 13th series. Dr. Rowan, a pretty female(as if that wasn't expected) lures Jason into a cryogenic chambre, freezing him, but accidentally freezing herself too. 400 years later they are discovered by a bunch of students. Horny teenage students. Starting to make sense yet? Here's where the Sci-Fi comes in. They have been unfrozen in the year 2455, when Earth is a barren wasteland and all humans now live on \"Earth 2\". This paves way for some fantastic special effects, CG space-ships, and all sorts of science-fictional gadgets.Seeing poor Rowan trying to adjust to life in the future, whilst the whole crew are being tracked down by everyone's favourite retarded machette-weilding anti-hero is really quite entertaining. It has a feel reminiscient of he classic, 'Alien', being stalked through a futuristic environment by something that wants to get you. Except in place of H.R.Giger's monstrosity, we have Jason.The effects are all fantastic, I haven't seen CG spaceships look so real in quite some time, in fact I stopped to think afterwards, \"were they CG?\". The space suit used later in the movie is almost an exact copy of the one from Stanley Kubrick's \"2001: A Space Odyssey\".The most exciting part, I'd have to say, is the appearance of \"Uber-Jason\", Jason's 'upgraded' self. The half-mechanoid monster looks like a cross between Predator and \"Lord Zedd\" from the Power Rangers(lol).There's also an interesting, and particularly amusing 'illusion' towards the end of the movie where Jason finds himself in Camp Crystal Lake again, which serves as a nice hint of Jason's past for newcomers, and as a nice bit of nostalgia for fans of the classics.Last, but not least, there's the 'spectacular death' scenes. Something that's been in the horror films for years, and Jason X is definitely no exception. A girl's face is frozen in liquid nitrogen and shattered to pieces on a table, a man falls on a big drill machine and rotates as his body 'screws' down onto it, necks are broken, people are cut in half, et cetera.The bottom line? A great Sci-Fi Horror. More of a thinking man's movie than the original Friday 13th franchise, but you don't have to be Einstein. Reccomended to most slasher and sci-fi fans, probably better for newbies to Friday 13th than hardcore fans because of the change in style, setting and sub-genre.",

But let me tell you something, this one blows all the previous Friday's out of the water. Kane Hodder give his best perfomance to date as the methodical serial killer Jason Vorhess. Too bad this was released too late to be included in 2002's Academy Awards. I think Kane Hodder, who no doubt tops Sir Anthony Hopkins perfomance in The Silence of the Lambs, would have easily defeated Russel Crowe. Also, James Isaac proves he has what it takes to be the next John Carpenter. Isaac, who directed the horror masterpiece The Horror Show (1989), proves that the sophmore hyjinx does not apply to all directors. He shines even more with Jason X. Seeing this film was the best $8 I spent all year. Hopefully this wasn't released too early that the Academy overlooks it for next years Oscar race!!",

The crew of some science vessel take him on board from a derelict and the foreseen chaos ensues.  Somewhere down the line, Jason gets upgraded and harder to kill than the previous impossible-to-kill version (go figure).  There are some genuine laughs in this movie (especially a scene towards the end with some holographic campers), the gore-level doesn't render it unwatchable for the squeamish, and nobody seems to take it too seriously.As I said before, it's an enjoyable use of your time if you don't have anywhere to go or anything better to do than sit around and rot your brain for a bit.",

The ass kicking android, the fact Jason was upgraded and the very end itself where somehow Brodski whisks in to save the day! Seriously?! Also the music added little suspense; rather a comical twist as it seemed somewhat provided by one man and a very expensive keyboard.Although the only flavor that can be accepted in this film is the kill scenes itself (where some do feel lacking) it is still O.K to watch if you have nothing better to do. It will keep your attention though stimulation may hinder from time to time and you will be somewhat entertained.I give it a 5 because I do enjoy the Jason selection.

            "content": "JASON X is a terrific, fast-paced, big-budget sci-fi/action movie that---silly plot synopsis aside---shouldn't work, yet does.  And why shouldn't it work?  Unlike previous entries in the series, this isn't a horror film.  It's a rip-off of James Cameron's ALIENS (1986), although now starring Kane Hodder as Jason Voorhees instead of those nasty, overgrown roaches with piranha teeth.  I watched this film in stunned disbelief.  I suspect that New Line Cinema's decision to postpone the film's US Theatrical release has nothing to do with the film's quality. (It shouldn't, because the movie is very good.) Instead, I wonder if JASON X is being withheld because New Line is still processing the shock of reading its name atop the \"Eagerly Awaited\" column in Cameron's logbook of upcoming court dates.  Not since Universal Pictures wiped GREAT WHITE off the face of God's green earth has there been such an opportunity to burn the master negative of a reported $13.5 million dollar motion picture.JASON X doesn't settle for lifting and reworking certain scenes from Cameron's space classic.  Oh no, it does so much more.  What do you call a movie that not only recreates the mood, setting and characters from someone else's original screenplay, but then also insists on lifting actual dialogue from that same screenplay and passing it off as its own?  How is it possible that director Jim Isaacs unknowingly staged entire segments of JASON X with his actors framed in the same proximity to the camera as in Cameron's film? And what's the defense when these actors physically react to these situations in exactly the same manner as the cast of Cameron's original?  I do not dare whisper the words, homage or spoof, because I have indeed seen the films of John Sayles and, in my opinion, a spoof is something the Zuckers Brothers are hired to do.  What we have here is something deliciously more akin to swiping your dad's credit card and using it to buy yourself a home theatre system with THX SurroundSound.  It's fun while it lasts, but sooner than later you're gonna get nailed by the higher-ups. And yet, I'm so pleased with the results of JASON X that I'm damned if I don't want the silly thing to break $100 million at the box office, if only to read how James Cameron copes with it.Let me say that JASON X does not begin promisingly.  The film opens with one of those standard attack sequences in which our heroine races from one darkened set to another, while Jason dispatches a quarter of the Screen Actors Guild and violins screech in the background.  I doubt whether such a high-security government facility would have truly allowed an imprisoned psychopath to continue wearing his hockey mask, but what the hell.  Jason gets cryogenically frozen and the film skips four hundred years into the future.  Before long, a group of teens on a field trip from \"Earth 2\" are dumping Jason's frozen carcass onto their orbiting spaceship, and never thinking twice about the bloody machete still clutched in his oversized mitts.  (In all fairness, they do observe that hockey was a violent sport outlawed in 2010.) Did I forget to mention that our dark-haired heroine was also cryogenically frozen in the same room with Jason and has now been rescued, too?  Or that the spaceship is filled with a rowdy band of Marines armed with enough firepower to overthrow a small Republic?  Or that there's an android aboard?  Or that the expedition's leader turns out to be a greedy entrepreneur with selfish motives?  This is not a movie that wastes time with creating new storylines, not when laying a piece of onion skin over somebody else's work and carbon-copying it idea-for-idea will suffice. Once Jason wakes up with a truly hateful headache, however, the film finally closes its eyes and steps on the gas.  It was at this point, I do suspect, a silly grin spread across my face.Take the scene, for example, where the Marines find themselves stalking Jason in a cargo room that's roughly the same size as that warehouse at the end of RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK.  The teens, huddled elsewhere on the ship, are monitoring this same track-and-pursuit by listening to the conversations being broadcast over the loudspeakers.  (Don't ask why.)  We're not stupid. We know that Jason is going to skewer every person in that cargo room.  We know this because we've been around a while.  We've seen a few horror flicks, maybe some sequels.  And of course we've seen ALIENS.  Jason finally does attack, while the camera zooms around corners and our heroine demands \"Get your men out of there!\", and walkie-talkies squawk about copy this and copy that.  And I didn't care a smidgen about how James Cameron did it better or that I was watching a rip-off, because the scene worked.  In fact, it rocked.And much later, when a new-and-improved Jason Voorhees strides through a shattered doorway, out of the smoke, as if daring you to make one more ALIENS reference, I knew this film had blindsided me.  It's a moment as cinematically thrilling as when Sigourney Weaver finally confronts the Queen, delivering the line quoted 'round the world.   And why shouldn't it work?  After all, it's the exact same scene.Yes, JASON X ought to be ashamed.  Perhaps I should be embarrassed for being so easily amused.  And yet, credit must be given to the filmmakers for attempting something unique---now nine sequels into the series---when the same tired storyline would have probably earned as much money.  Yes, the film has flaws.  The first half-hour shows severe signs of tampering in the editing room, including an awful sex scene between a student and teacher that feels like a filmed memo from the Audience Research Department to the screenwriter.  (This particular moment almost collapses the movie.)  On the other hand, the final three minutes of JASON X are everything that a certain 2001 re-imagining claimed to be, without involving apes on motorcycles. This is the best film in the series.So, we've been to Camp Crystal Lake.  We've been to hell.  We've even been to space.  For the next installment, I suggest the filmmakers now further Jason's adventures.  I've heard there's this little-known art-house film about an island overrun by dinosaurs...",

Hence, it does have its usual large gathering of individuals with a couple who are intelligent, and the rest being airheads. The film is more on the sci-fi side (with its setting 100% in outer space), and not the usual forest of Crystal Lake, as we all have been made familiar for Jason Voorhees' domain. Kane Hodder again makes an excellent performance as 'Jason', as he has for the last 4 films. This film, however, has a lot of comedic twists and punch lines. Although the film is not in traditional format, it seems to keep up with the sign of the times, with today's world that follows with the sci-fi genre. Jason X is `SpaceBalls' meets `Terminator' that meets `Starship Troopers'. Lets just say that we should hold out for `Freddy Vs. Jason'.",

            "review_title": "What crap!",
            "content": "Sitting through a short part of this film, I knew that this had to be one of the worst films of all time. One thing that bugs me is the continuity gap. Okay, so the series has not been exactly great in this faction, but the last time we saw Jason, he was being physically pulled into Hell (by the way, wasn't the title of that film Jason Goes to Hell: The FINAL Friday? I suppose that it was only in reference to the series' title and not the franchise itself). Well, we have to assume that this film exists in an alternative timeline because the film makes no reference to how the film's un-killable butcher is back now. The film starts in a not-too distant future where Jason has been captured and awaits some sort of sentence. The film is also unclear on how they managed to contain someone who has breathed in more bullets then a shooting range. Are we to assume that they triumphed where the Squat team from Jason Goes To Hell failed in blowing him away? The film clearly exits outside of how the rest of the series sets itself up. Either that or I believe that whomever wrote this film has never actually seen one of the Friday films; they just know enough that he is Jason Voorhees and that he kills kids who practice the prescription of drugs, alcohol and sex. The film is really a bad blend of the following: the self-conscious remarks of the characters from Scream, but minus the humour, wit and irony; every sloppy sci-fi film, especially Aliens; a bit of the Terminator films; the film also manages to rip itself off, there is a scene that recalls the sexual relationship between student and professor from VII: Jason takes Manhattan, as well as an updated version of the paintball game in part VI. Now if you can ignore all that, there is the fact that the dialog is lamer then anything I have heard. There is no plot (obviously), but the main point is that the film really p****d on a good concept and did just the same thing here and there. That Leprechaun in Space movie worked better then this. There is something about the depths of space that can turn any horror franchise into some of the most laughable pieces in cinema history. But mainly in this film (more so then in the Leprechaun film... a series that never really worked anyway in my opinion), the characters are twice as big as idiots. For a film using ideas such as cryogenics and a futuristic/outer space setting, nothing is really being done differently. The killings are boring with the exception of only one, which contains a freeze-dryer but even that doesn't escape predictability. The film tries to be funnier then the previous films and that means a lot of jokes, but only two are worth mentioning (hint: one is the adverts). Everything else, well, imagine every dumb thing kids did in the previous installments, then add some futuristic touches and you get the point. My only other gripe then a continuity loop is a character that gets frozen along with Jason. From the rumours I had heard, it sounded like she was a key figure to the story, possibly even holding a secret to Jason, like how to destroy him. I was wrong.  Her purpose in the film is highly questionable seeing as how she adds nothing to anything... but then again, who in this film actually does? At least if she were, it would make the film a lot more interesting. Maybe I should not overanalyze what is obviously a dumb film, but even dumb films work better then this. I have seen every film in the series and this is by far the worse. At least those films were acting out in an organic response to some characters and situations at times. The ending to this little forgettable romp is a bit unique, even interesting I have to admit, but only given the film's setting. It was a bit redemptive seeing as how it was about the only thing I remember. Actually, there is an interesting scene where Jason is in a hologram of Crystal Lake, but neither the taste of the joke and the scene itself last long enough to tide. However, all the little bits of simplistic mystique and guilty-pleasure back story from the rest of the films have been erased and leaves you not wanting more, but instead, wondering as to why they didn't makes you want more. At least the other films, as well as many other slashers, make it seem as though they are trying. Throw us some sort of bone and feed us something interesting. The only thing that makes me want to go see this again is the music playing in the end credits. I'm contemplating as to whether it's worth sitting through all that rubbish again just to listen to what I found to be a refreshing slasher score. But if there is one thing this installment teaches you, it's that no matter how far we advance in civilization with technology in the centuries to come, people will continue to behave asinine and take stupid actions when masked serial killers are on the loose. Let's just hope they can write better stories by then. I can only hope that Jason vs. Freddy is now the next agenda and that it will be worth the wait that this one couldn't promise.",

Even though Hodder wasn't the original, he wears the character so well), and a supporting cast of new faces add to the excitement. Visuals are great and there is an excellent \"fight\" scene between sexy Android Kay-Em 14 (Lisa Ryder) and Mr. Jason, with edge-of-your-seat music to back it up. Harry Manfredini does a great music score for his 9th Jason film (he missed \"Jason Takes Manhattan\") and James Isaac does an excellent job as director.

I would rate six as best. That was the first one to take the approach that this is all kind of a joke...the same as myself. I don't buy into people who have been shot 100 times (or worse) getting up and walking around. At least not over the period of time that the Jasons and Mike Myers have survived. You would bleed to death. In 6 he becomes un-dead. Now he's believable unstoppable. The next three films where lacking in imagination. This didn't... the only thing it really REALLY lacked was a budget. With H20 money they could get a couple of LL Cool J's Or Jamie Lees and maybe polish those limited F/X.

I reckon they spent more on this movie than all the others put together.They certainly didn't spend it on a script, or acting. No change there then!

I was 17 whenever JASON GOES TO HELL came out and it was the first FT13 film I saw in the theatre.  Needless to say, that movie sucked -- but, I've seen it several times since.  I first heard about JASON X about 2 years ago and was actually pretty excited about it.  It was supposed to come out over a year ago -- but, there was a lot of personnel problems over at NEW LINE and the release date kept getting pushed out. Finally, the movie had an official release date and the countdown began. I told my wife that we were \"so there\" on opening night and she just cringed with total anticipation.  You see, she was never into the FT13 movies and really had no interest in seeing it.  Well, needless to say, WE went to the movie on opening night and along with about 12 other people, walked away feeling like NEW LINE and everyone involved owed us back our money.  WHAT HAPPENED?  Where was that kick-ass movie that the trailer hinted at?  Now, some of you would say, \"Well, by now, you should have known better\", -- and you know what, you are probably right. When the movie first started, I was excited and I actually jumped out of my seat in one of the opening scenes. Then, somewhere along the way, JASON X became a cross between ALIENS, STAR TREK, and ERNEST GOES TO SPACE. In other words, EVIL GOT A COMEDY UPGRADE. For a minute, I though \"NATIONAL LAMPOON\" was behind it. If I had wanted to go see a comedy, I would have seen \"VAN WILDER\" again.  This movie didn't just stink, IT STANK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

JASON X was a goofy, mostly entertaining flick that liberally stole bits from dozens of other sci-fi/horror films. At least it was nowhere as bad as CRITTERS 4 and LEPRECHAUN 4, both of which also took their series stars into space. Here we have Jason cryogenically frozen in the near future, only to be re-animated in the year 2455 by a group of space-faring archaeologists/medical students aboard their ship, which of course causes the usual carnage. Some interesting kills (I especially liked Jason's creative use of liquid nitrogen!) but overall JASON X wasn't scary, it was more of a bloody action picture. Take Jason out of the scenes with the space marines stalking around dark corridors and replace him with an Alien and you'd have any of the ALIEN series. If you've seen the other nine (!) FRIDAY movies and have the same weird sense of duty that I do, feel free to pick up JASON X at your local video vendor, but those of you expecting a real scary movie are advised to look elsewhere.

The acting is worse than usual, or maybe the bad acting is less forgivable due to the budget of the film. It's hard to say.

But seeing this movie was the worst thing i could possible do, Jason is now on space, if you believe that you could think this is a good movie, but after watch it you're gonna hate it. What was the writer of this movie thinking when he was writing it, is very awful, stupid, ridiculous, that ever the own Jason could possibly hate this movie.It's really the wost movie ever made, just for th fact of the story, and if this is a real horror movie, where lost. I really though it was the parody of the series, but i realize that it doesn't.1/10",

But, when I saw the preview for Jason X, I was surprised at how good it looked. And well, I wasn't really disappointed.While, I'm not fond of most of the Jason movies (the only other one I really like is the one most people hate \"Jason Takes Manhattan\"), I did like this one.There was a lot of silly stuff in this movie, but that's the trend nowdays, to make horror movies \"comedy-horror\" or vice versa.The fight scene between Jason and Lisa Ryder(otherwise known as Bekka on Andromeda)'s character was absolutely awesome! Note that the other main female character was Lexa Doig(sp)who plays \"Romi\" on Andromeda.While not the best movie in the world, it was still quite entertaining. There were some things in the film I could have done without, but all in all, a pretty decent flick.*** 1/2 out of 4 *'s.",

            "content": "This film was quite enjoyable for the most part.  The initial action scene involving Jason an some local marine grunts (w. Cronenberg) really pumps the viewer up.  Jason is quicker and more realistic in this film, and Kane Hodder breathes life into the mass murderer in many subtle, yet effective ways (eg. mannerisms, eye contact, etc.).  The acting in the film was surprisingly strong for this type of film, but no one takes the subject matter too seriously.  Likewise, the special effects are used sparingly, but the sets are very atmospheric.  This episode has a budget of $14 million dollars, and I can safely say that the money was well spent.  The tone of the film is now a chase film, as opposed to a slasher film - and I believe this was necessary at this stage in the series because a rehash of the previous films would insult any self-respecting horror film fanatic's intelligence (I think?).  The comedy that is interspersed throughout the film is in fact 'not' annoying this time out.  I only have two concerns - (a) Now that the bar has been raised to such a high level (in Jason standards)- how do you top Jason X? (b) Now that Jason is 'Uber-Jason' - how do you continue that aspect of the character into the next sequels? (You need Kane Hodder of course - but what if you want to have Jason back in the sticks?)  In all - bravo, but too short a film (could have been 2 hours in length).",

The whole movie is great though most of the time, until we get to the robot part. I'm being vague to not spoil anything, but basically, once the robot-Jason takes form, the movie is officially done. It was totally a let-down and over-blow of a great story. The producers didn't know when to quit.

I also think it's good they dropped the \"Friday\" in the title. It's all about Jason since part II anyway. If you want to know why slasher movies are barely made anymore, watch this movie: It's as mindless as it can get. Jason's there. He's invincible. He's murdering. No reason given for anything. He's just doing it. Don't wonder about anything, they won't explain it. Don't think the plot makes sense. Don't even expect a working story. It's all not important. The only thing you can hope for in slasher movies are cool, different locations, some brief nudity and different ways of killing people. And in this aspect, Jason X rocks. High budget. Cool sets. Cool special effects. Tons of gore and Jason slashes his evil heart out to the extreme with some very cool death scenes. I mean, freezing the head of a person, and then smashing this frozen head to pieces? Geez, who's getting such ideas. The thing Jason's doing with the sleeping bags gets a clever reprise. As far as I know, he did this in another part.\n*minor spoilers*Also, Jason's not killing helpless civilians (students, read teenagers) only, but also has to deal with highly trained soldiers and a harmless bot, which got upgraded to a mean fighting machine (\"'fraid I'm gonna have to hurt you now.\"). By the way, I absolutely love this bot. Witty remarks and an actress who obviously enjoyed her play. If you absolutely hate this movie, at least fast forward to the fight Jason vs. bot. It's the best scene of the movie. The end of the movie manages it in a believable way to get back on \"earth\". You even hear the typical \"Friday, 13th\" music... doors for the next part are open wide.Jason X is stealing from a lot of movies. Critters IV comes to mind, which is also based in a space-ship in the future. Also I think of Aliens (highly equipped soldiers dying, and a civilian yelling \"Get them out of there!\"), Aliens IV (existing monster gets reborn into an \"uber monster\") and Matrix (costume design of soldiers/bot, character gets martial arts training uploaded). The story is extremely stupid, and I think just watching this movie my IQ lowered some points, but it was fun to watch... and this is the most important thing, isn't it? For a normal movie I'd give it a 3/10, but rated as slasher movie it deserves a 8/10.",

But after being disappointed with Jason Goes To Hell, I was hoping for more.\nYou have a very mixed bag here. First off, I have to say I'm not a huge fan of the whole space-ship sci-fi motif so the movie loses points on my scale immediately. Secondly, the year 2455 ? Come on, that's a lil too far in the future don't you think ? Thirdly, the characters seem really dumb for such sophisticated people. Not knowing what a hockey mask or a bike was made me want them dead in a hurry myself.Surprisingly though, the first hour or so, was pretty interesting  to say the least. Jason was going about his regular non-essential character killing spree before things, in my opinion, go horrifically wrong. The whole sequence where the robot/android \"kills\" him is simply retarded. It seemed more like a Lara Croft:Tomb Raider rip off more than anything else. But I suppose they need this to happen in order to create this \"Cyber-Jason\". While I'll admit he does look kinda cool (although I think the original Jason looks better), he just comes back like this WAAY too late in the movie to give this transformation credibility.I may not speak for everyone with this review, and of course people have the right to their own opinion but I prefered the old school friday the 13th films over this one. But hopefully they come back to that old time forest rampage action with the next film, which seems enivitable with the final sequence involving the mask floating in the water.With that being said, New fans to the series may like this one, and perhaps old school fans will too depending on whether you've lost faith in the series altogether or not. It's not a terrible movie by any means, it just got lost along the way!",

And to tell you the truth, I was pleasantly surprised.There are some things in the movie that are really predictable (just as you'd think) but there're some good parts too.

Jason X was everything one expects from a slasher film- blood and guts, bad acting, cheesy music- but it was by far funnier than any slasher film I've seen. It never takes itself seriously, and that is the beauty of it. The characters don't seem to care that they are about to be killed as long as they can say some sarcastic remark before they get axed. Some of the deaths were inventive and a scene with two crystal lake camp counselors is the funniest thing I've seen at the movies all year. Don't see this movie if you are looking for award winning cinema, but I would recommend this for people looking for an entertaining movie.",

It has everything you would expect from a Friday the 13th movie... and more. Plenty of gore scenes, some funny and selfironic stuff, a lot of allusions to the other jason movies, many sexy dressed chicks and a really evil Jason on a killing spree. This is definitely one of the best Jason movies. When I first heard about this movie, I had my doubts about the futuristic theme, but it suits the movie very well (unlike Hellraiser IV) and adds some fresh ideas to the Friday the 13th series. Even the Terminator/Robocop like Jason at the end of the movie fits in well. If you're a fan of this genre, go watch it in a theater as soon as you can and definitely buy the DVD (but only if they release this uncut version)!",

What bugs me is that they keep making crap like this because people keep watching it. I read some review on Rotten Tomatoes in which the critic, probably some guy living in his parent's basement, argued that critics would pan this film just because it's a slasher film. I think it's quite the opposite. I think slasher fans will love any piece of crap no matter how terrible it is. There are well made Slasher films. The original Friday The Thirteenth, the original Halloween, the original Nightmare on Elmstree, Scream, and many more. These weren't masterpieces of American cinema but they at least managed to be creepy and entertaining. Not the case with this. It's terribly shot, terribly acted, and, worst of all, not the least bit scary. There's never any tension in the film. Most of the deaths are quick and silly with little to no suspense or build up. Any build up that is there simply amounts to us looking at Jason standing stationary as he waits to kill someone. Why is it that horror fans can't distiguish a good slasher film from a bad one? Why do they let studios get away with crap like this? And I grow tired of the \"it's tongue-in-cheek\" defense. Pulling off tongue-in-cheek requires writing that's witty and amusing. Not hoping that because you're dialogue, acting, and directing is so bad that people will laugh awkwardly. I can get that boy showing home videos of kids learning to potty-train and it sure as hell wouldn't cost me 13 million dollars.",

The effects are really cool, especially the splatter effects (at best on the Europian DVD (NC-17 rating!).

Then one of the head scientists decide they will keep him alive so they can study him.

That's when they come across two frozen bodies. One, a VERY hot girl. The other, some freaky guy wearing a hockey mask and wielding a machete.  That's when the plot holes start to kick in. the first one, it is not very smart to thaw out a tall freak who is wearing a hockey mask and has a machete in his hand.  Now what kind of idiots thaw out a person like that? Our doomed students are.  So they unthaw the two bodies out and the first one is the hot girl.  She tells them not to unthaw the other one because it is the infamous Jason Voorhees.  But they're a little too late for that. Jason is already on the loose and might I add is VERY p**sed off.  Then comes the screaming and running and dying.Most of the characters in this flick are pretty cool, like the sexually curious android and the tough Sergeant who just won't die.  The fights between Jason and Kay-Em 14(the android) is very entertaining, along with the fight between Jason and Sergeant Broadski.  Most of this movie isn't as bad as critics say.  Jason gets to revisit Camp Crystal Lake circa 1980. He gets to entertain two pre-marital loving campers, and even redoes a classic death in Friday the 13th part 7 (I won't give it away.)

Not that electricity would bring him back to life after his body was decayed for awhile(like \"Friday the 13th, Part VI: Jason Lives\" suggested). All of these horror movies can easily have had better plots. Why don't the writers see to it that they do? Because people like me will continue to see such movies simply because it deals with Jason, Freddy, Michael Myers, etc. Since these movies are meant to be ridiculous and silly and incoherent, then I must say that the producer and director have reached their goal. Bravo! Reaching one's goal is what it's all about, so any rating less than a 10 would be unjust.",

Granted, alien was an awesome movie, but it was a horror movie with a creature FROM space, not a serial killer that hides in the woods and used to chop off teenagers that smoked pot and had 'round the clock sex (good old times, sigh) that's suddenly shipped off to space.As for the contents of the movie, the acting is totally lame, (it kind of looks like some bad TV movie acting), the sets are incredibly badly built, and what the hell was that? Uber Jason? When I saw that I couldn't believe my eyes..Jason is freakin' terminator now? Fighting a robot chick (or whatever)? The doctor who got frozen with him was the worst female lead in a horror movie of all time, the rest of the remaining characters, god, i just wanted to dress myself as Jason and kill them all myself. they were so annoying, you just want to watch them die. And if the whole freaking world knows how dangerous Jason Vorhees is, WHY IN HELL WOULD SOMEOME WANT TO KEEP HIM ALIVE? Because he's a god damned zombie? Come on, get real..This movie just seems to be a stern of ludicrous ideas and an attempt to revitalize the Friday the 13th saga, which, imo, killed it instead. I am a huge Friday the 13th fan, but this movie is really horrible.I don't advise anyone to waste their time in this piece of crap, unless you want to rip out your eyeballs so you don't have to watch (which I almost did).Seriously, don't waste your time with this one, just not worth it, at all.",

Must he torture us with horrible movies while doing so? What is his purpose? What will he do after everyone is dead? Sit around? Why can't people kill him? When some one shoots him he just keeps coming, its gotten old and predictable. Why even fight? You know whoever fights him is gonna die. They can at least humor me and if thats the case, why even make a movie?

I even half expected Rowan (Lexa Doig) to come out in a power loader (\"Get away from her you bitch..uh...you b**tard!\") It could have been so much cooler...a better editor could have even made it kick ass. As such, there are two, maybe three pretty damn cool parts in the flick, and the rest just makes me feel like a tool for supporting this movie for 3 plus years.

It was my first chance to see a Jason film on the big screen as the series went direct to video in Germany a long time ago. So standing in line for a sold-out showing of a Jason sequel in Germany used to be quite impossible to imagine.I should add that I'm a big fan of 80s slashers and the FRIDAY THE 13TH-series. My favourite Jason films so far were PART 2 as it's the scariest and Part 6: JASON LIVES that started to celebrate Jason as the unrivalled hero of the series. I had high expectations for JASON X but it still had to live up to an entire series of films I really enjoy.I can tell you it did. First of all the special effects looked really good. This isn't THE MATRIX but considering the quite low budget the space sequences looked fine. Of course, space is not what the film's about. Unsurprisingly, I was pretty sceptical when I first heard about the space setting. But this film is still about Jason and the makers aren't afraid to admit it. It really shows that both director James Isaac and screenwriter Todd Farmer are fans of the series. While Michael Myers didn't play enough of a role in HALLOWEEN: H20 for my taste, Jason is at the centre of this one. And there's no tendency to make him less evil or violent, either. There is some humour in JASON X, but that has always been part of the series. This isn't a self-ironic sell-out to audiences that are used to bad and boring films like VALENTINE and URBAN LEGENDS being called horror. JASON X is basically an 80s slasher flick with a higher budget. So if someone has a problem with the concept of a superhuman, unstoppable killing machine being the hero of a franchise, JASON X probably won't win them over. But if you like slasher flicks and therefore don't expect this to win Academy Awards I can hardly imagine anyone being disappointed. You've got your masked psychopath, a supply of pointy objects, gory and surprisingly creative kills (in particular Jason's first one aboard the space ship) and of course lots of potential victims that have no idea what they're up against. On the other hand there could have been more suspense. In that respect JASON X is similar to JASON LIVES which is fun and spectacular but doesn't really try to scare the audience too much.While two thirds of the film are good without necessarily presenting anything new, the last half hour actually has a few unexpected surprises including one of the most nostalgic and funny sequences in horror film history. I don't want to give it away but once the score from Part 1 starts playing and Jason finds himself in a familiar place fans of the series are in for a real treat. I also liked the ending very much that once again pays tribute to the series. I definitely left with a smile on my face.In conclusion I can say JASON X is the best new slasher / horror film I have seen in a long time. It has some modern elements, but it stays true to the series. I definitely recommend it!",

Almost all the people on the \"transporter\" were late teens/early 20s and, of course, the girls are hot. You get the prerequisite breast shots and pre-marital sex to raise Jason's ire. Also, there is some good intentional humor, essential in cheap horror movies. There is a bit of cheesiness present but not much and the movie keeps good pace and is entertaining.",

There are similarities in characters from this movie to the others..The lines that they say...like, \"he is dead!\", \"we are safe now!\" those lines we have heard over and over on all of the Jason films.

Jason does the same thing he did in the previous Friday movies, just this time he does it in space.  Acting is fine for this type of movie, which again, isn't saying much, but they hold their own.  The story isn't exactly the most well developed, and it doesn't quite pick up where Part 9 left off. I guess Jason got lost in route to hell.

It basically looks like a Fullmoon direct-to-video flick, but with a higher budget than any fullmoon film. The basic plot is that Jason is frozen at Camp Crystal Lake facility in the year 2004 (I think) or 2007 and then 4.55 hundred years later he is thawed out and brought back to life by a scientist and his college students.  And get this, it takes place in space. Ok, you already knew that and so didn't I going into the movie. Hell I should have used common sense to steer clear of this, but I wanted to see a cheesy movie and Jason X oozed with it. I went and was expecting what I saw in the trailer, a roller coaster, horror cheese fest. Was I wrong though about it being somewhat decent. There is no suspense or thrills, like in the other Friday the 13ths, in this flick and the dialogue is dry and utter nonsense.  \"Its ok guys he just wanted his machete back.\" UGH!!!  Or how about the line when one the guy (don't remember his name or any of the characters because they weren't important except Jason) is thrown on a giant screw. One of the soldiers finds him dead and get this when the captain asks the man's status the stupid bitch replies, \"he is screwed.\" Oh dear.  Every hallway in the god damn ship has no lights. They have the technology to bring people back to life, but they don't have the intelligence to put lights in a space ship. I expected gore and rather twisted, but cool death scenes and I was disappointed once again except for one death. Just one and it was when Jason froze the hot blonde's head and then shattered it to pieces against the counter. Poor thing. Why do the hot ones always die in the beginning? Even the cutest guy was butchered 10 mins later. Dammit. At least both of them had small parts and won't be remembered being in this crap pile.  Anyways, the only good scenes were Jason's upgrade and the virtual reality camp Crystal Lake.  Oh god that was funny and possibly the best, demented sick humor I have seen in a while, those poor female campers. HEHE!!!

Being an Gen X'er who grew up with these movies, I have to say, when one thinks about it, this is quite an accomplishment for ANY movie franchise. I mean, how many movies make it to a -10th-, outside of the porn industry, that is? Sure, it may not be academy award winning stuff, but it's fun popcorn entertainment nonetheless. In this particular sequel, the series finally takes the well-advised turn into sci-fi-horror-humor. There are some sincerely funny, dry-wit one liners in this movie. And of course we have Jason, who, like that battery bunny just keeps going and going and going... The movie finally changes the general scenery from the other films and jumps 450 years into the future, which may not make much sense until you actually watch it, but it does make for an interesting twist in the series. Of course, as with all the previous Friday's, there are an abundance of wildly creative death sequences, a bevy of beautiful, unheard of, actors and actresses, all of whom are fodder for Jason (Kane Hodder). But then, let's be honest, if you're watching this movie, would you be expecting anything less? Rooting for Jason to kill the beautiful people is what drives the series, in my humble opinion, and there is plenty of rooting to be done in this one. Near the end of the film we get to see Uber-Jason. Futuristically reconstructed and even more unstoppable, if that was even possible. On top of all that, we even get a hilarious throwback to the very first Friday the 13th (think sleeping bags). In the end, this movie is just plain fun and well worth a trip to the theater. But if you miss it, don't worry..  the movie clearly sets up a possibility of Friday the 13th Part 11. >",

I went into this movie expecting a great addition to the series and thats exactly what I got.  I am a huge fan of the series, and after the disappointing Jason Goes To Hell, I was glad that Jason X wasn't so disappointing.First of all the plot is very original.  Putting Jason in space had always appealed to me.  I think the idea would be pretty cool.  And it was.Then there would be the killing and gore.  I think this one had great kills and lots of gore.  The killing was basically non-stop and if you weren't a main character, you'd probably get about 5 lines and then Jason would hack you up.  That's another thing I liked.I liked how Jason seemed more human in the beginning of the film.  It made the transformation into Uber-Jason more effective.  I thought Uber-Jason looked kick ass.The acting was cool.  The best actor was probably Peter Mensah who played the kick ass black guy Sgt. Brodski.  Lexa Doig who plays Rowan, the heroine did a good job as the lead chick.  Lisa Ryder was pretty funny as the android Kay-Em 14.  Chuck Campbell who played Tsunaron did a pretty decent job playing the smart dude.  Jonnothan Potts did a good job as the sleazy professor.  And Kane Hodder of course did great as the man behind the mask!The plot was great.  It was basically about how people managed to capture Jason Voorhees.  A scientist named Rowan (Lexa Doig) wanted Jason to be frozen until they found out what to do with them.  But then a militay group with another scientist come in and want to transport him out.  Rowan knows he's a killing machine but the other scientist wants to study him because of his amazing capability to not be harmed and his ability to reproduce tissue at a fast rate.  Then Jason awakes and kills the militay group and the scientists.  Rowan freezes herself with Jason by accident and then 400 years later a group of students discover her and Jason.In the future, Earth is a wasteland and people live on another planet called Earth II.  The students discover Rowan and Jason and think that Jason is dead but they believe they can bring back Rowan.  They bring her on the ship and bring her back.  They manage to bring her back and then Jason wakes up and begins to destroy students and marines (who are on the ship with students for protection purposes) until only a few students, a marine Sgt. Brodski (Peter Mensah) and the ships android Kay-Em 14 (Lisa Ryder).Kay-Em 14 gets an upgrade and basically anihilates Jason.  Then Jason gets upgraded on the regenerating table and becomes a metal hockey mask wearing Uber-Jason.  Kay-Em tries to stand up against him but Uber-Jason punches her head off!  Then Uber-Jason begins to slaughter the remaining students until only Brodski, Rowan, and a few others are left.  I won't spoil the ending but it's a must see!",

            "content": "I really enjoyed the old Friday the 13th movies, so when I first saw a commercial advertising Jason X, I knew I had to go see this one even though the movie looked horrible (haha).  This movie was unbelievably corny and silly.  At least some of the original movies in the series were somewhat believable, but Jason X was so different and intentionally humorous that I'm sure a lot of people think the movie has destroyed the franchise which became one of the cornerstones of horror.If you haven't seen this movie, but have seen some of the first ones, imagine this: Jason Vorhees set loose inside a space ship much like the Starship Enterprise on Star Trek: The Next Generation (complete with Holodecks, I'm serious).  Yeah, Jason basically walks around this spaceship with his machete and kills everybody one by one.  It's so stupid that it's funny.  The story is absolutely horrible especially with the way the movie cuts from one scene to another.I thought the funniest part of the movie was*** SPOILER AHEAD ***close to the end when the original space ship blew up, yet Jason was flying in outer space towards the ship.  That was so silly -- probably the silliest thing I have ever seen in a horror movie, or any movie for that matter.If you're a fan of the series or the horror genre, obviously you'll want to see it.  If you're looking for a quick fix / good laugh, this is also a good movie for it.  I mean, you basically have to go into this movie already expecting it to be a little random and outrageous, cause that's exactly what it is.  I'd recommend most people to wait for it to hit the $1.50 theaters or even the local video store.",

Well, i use to switch off my brain while watching Horror-Movies as it can't stand most of em for long and would gain a serious damage. Well, watching Jason X even the primary brain functions to perform life support are enough to see through this very thin story as it lacks of any surprises. To say the truth: The story is almost absent and can be told with just 11 words: Frozen Jason gets reactivated in future and kills people on starship. Ok, if it is well done, even that can be enough. In this case it is not. Seems like the director/writers of this movies just had played too much Unreal Tournament, at least Jasons Frag-Rate is the nearly the same and in the end he even gets a nice armour (well, as a player model it would look good in UT, indeed...). Sometimes they tried to make it a bit funny like scream but failed. So all what is left is  Jason killing people and even that gets boring after a while. For some decent Special FX and the nice Design of Jasons Armour it gets 2 points. For dumb characters in the movie that are -as usual in that genre- too dumb to stick together in a room and concentrate their firepower it gets one removed. Makes 1 point. If it helps to prevent part no. 11 i will give more, promised.PARA2K",

Any person who expects this to be a frightening movie will be severely disappointed.  The movie is actually very very funny!There are a lot of problems with this movie that leave one asking these questions:  How did he get out of Hell?  What happened to Camp Crystal Lake? When did Jason grow hair?  How did Jason get so muscular?  How is Jason able to regenerate damaged tissue?  Why would anyone 450 years in the future know anything about Jason Voorhees?  Why does this look like a made for TV movie?  Why upgrade Jason to an invincible character (cloning him may have been a move)when no one's been able to kill him for the past 9 movies?  Why do they wait until the last 10 minutes to upgrade Jason?This movie has an unoriginal plot that is a blend of Aliens, Alien Resurrection, and the other 9 Friday the 13th movies; poor and predictable action, bland dialogue that is filled with puns that play on how Jason kills people, poor special effects, scenes that stop and forget to go again, stupid characters with no development and no intelligence that just won't die fast enough, and an outdated horror concept that is no longer scary.Altogether, it makes one of the funniest movies ever.

Even though this is the 10th installment (I guess that explains the \"X\" in \"JASON X\") of what I thought was a series, taking into account that this movie has absolutely NOTHING to do with any of the other \"Friday the 13th\" movies, this film just doesn't cut it.  There's not enough gore like usual, the killings suck (c'mon, why the hell would the camera cut away when someone's about to get slaughtered by the hands of Jason Vorhees!), not enough nudity, and worst of all...we get the treat of seeing \"horror get an UPGRADE\" - a cyborg Jason Vorhees.  What the hell is that all about!?  The fact that this whole movie takes place in space on a damn wannabe Star Trek shuttle is no picnic either.  The only thing even remotely decent about this film was the Suburban Commando (hahaha) who wasn't afraid of Jason, as well as getting to stare at Lexa Doig for an hour and a half.  Other than that, if you're a true Jason fan, then you'll understand my disgust and pure disappointment for this piece of trash, and you'll do what's best and forget that \"JASON X\" was even made.

But you can tell that this film also had a lot of love put into it. To just rehash the same script out just for a bunch of sad Friday fans would be the biggest waste of New Lines money. The film was greatly entertaining with no pretence that the whole genre has now ground to a halt. Other films like the Halloween series, Scream, I know what you did in the last movie, Urban legend, Valentine and the countless other Halloween and Friday 13th copies have made the slasher genre so predicable, that the ludicrous plot and sci-fi makes this film so refreshing. I totally urge anyone who doesn't have hang ups about change to see this movie. As the summary says, it's a no brainer, with great eye candy(effects and girls and gore).

If your going to see a story that says something like the Matrix or Requiem for a Dream then a slasher movie is not for you. Jason X delivers in all the ways that it should and like it should doesn't take itself too seriously and ruin the story by trying to make a Jason movie more than an unstoppable killing machine taking care of business with horny teenagers.

These so-called fans talk in interviews and commentary for this movie about their displeasure with some aspects of the previous films, and it is precisely these aspects that make the original films (say, the first four) so great.Personally, I think any kind of self-reference or humor in a movie like this is a bad idea. SCREAM already did this, and perhaps it opened the door for all the horror franchises it referenced to return and reference themselves in order to be \"hip\" again. That was undoubtedly a major factor provoking this film. Although tinges of reference to (also known as direct ripoffs of) earlier entries in the series are present in the first three fourths of the movie, it eventually degenerates into completely stupid parody. I see this as an affront to all of the original films and all those who remain fans of them.The space idea has been done or at preliminary developed in horror franchise after horror franchise, and historically it has never worked. JASON X succeeds not only in ripping off the earlier films (in attempt, of course, to be \"chic\" and \"self-referential\") but also virtually every classic space movie (2001, ALIEN, and ALIENS come to mind offhand). I don't think the consensus is clear yet whether this film truly \"revitalized\" the Friday franchise. But in order to regain its dignity, this franchise must not continue in this direction.",

This was stolen straight from obscure art film Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze. The masked marauder of murder then survives several explosions and a virtual reality ruse before falling at the hands of a cosmic piggy back ride. The movie, like a derelict father, sends us to bed with no answers, just the heartwarming sensation that Jason is still alive and well. I just don't understand why anyone would fight him now.

Now I do realise that this is the tenth Jason Vorhees film and that the horror element has now been extinguished but in my personal opinion, what is the point of releasing yet another Jason horror film that simply isn't scary?  The most impressive element of this film is over and done with within the first two and a half minutes with Jason killing 7 people within that short space of time!  Even a critic of this film could at least be able to say that that was impressive! This adds to Jason's already massive body count of 191 people.  He is the killer with the highest body count out of all of the major horror killers to date.  I don't really think that the middle of the film needs explaining because if you have seen any other Jason films then you will know that the main bulk of the film involves gratuitous violence and some sex.I think that, at least in the UK, the demand for Jason films has dropped significantly and the first weekend box office takings show that they only made \u00a3233,090 whereas in the US they made $6.649 million.  Compare that to a budget of \u00a314 million then you have got a small difference!  I could commend some of the actors on their performance but generally it is difficult to know if they can act when they are mainly having sex or running around being chased by and murdered by Jason.  Kane Hodder plays Jason again in Jason X and this film is his favourite.  I must admit though, a highlight further on in the film was definitely the Crystal Lake Campers and their top quote 'We love pre-marital sex!' and then the classic moment where Jason uses one of the sleeping bags with one girl in to beat the other the other girl in her sleeping bag. FANTASTIC STUFF!  No matter how much I dislike the rest of the film, at least there was another bit near to the end of the film to make sitting through the rest of the painful re-make worth while.  Overall I think that the film should have been portrayed as a comedy and NOT a horror film.",

            "content": "I believe that Jason X should never have been passed as a horror film. It is a comedy pure and simple. We begin with a completely unbelieveable first scene. Jason is trapped with chains, ropes, you name it yet he escapes and goes off in search of fresh blood. Excuse me but how does anyone escape from thousands of chains and rope?! I mean don't get me wrong this is quite a good film but it is far too unrealistic. Jason just happens to escape, then just happens to be thawed out of his trapped frozen state. Be real! It just wouldn't happen. I have to admit that this film did make me laugh, in fact it totally cracked me up. Jason becomes a robot of sorts.He tries to kill two girls by picking them up in sleeping bags and hitting them against a tree. What do they do? They laugh and say oohh, aaahhh! It's totally ridiculous. I think that was truly AMAZING. I mean what a classic comedy that would make! But no, looking at it as a member of the audience where was the horror?! There were no gruesome or especially frightening parts, there was just laugh after laugh after laugh!!! If this was meant to be a comedy I would say \"Wow, what a great film.\" BUT it's not... It's a horror and a tacky, awful one at that. I wouldn't recommend this as a horror movie but if you're wanting a good night out and to laugh nonstop then go see this film. I give it 0/10 for horror aspects but a huge thumbs up and 10/10 for comedy! Go Jason!!!",

The outcome unfortunately, is a slightly funny, unrealistic, version of some of the classics, like Halloween and the first Friday 13th. Back then people wanted to see blood, guts and plenty of stalk 'n' slash, now all we get is people coming out with some of the worst lines ever, while they are face to face with the killer. People still want to be put into suspense and this film's only positive side is that it does add a few twists towards the end.Jason can never be killed, why Jason's victims don't start to do what they are supposed to do and get running, instead of standing in their in the face of death with not a chance in the world, is beyond knowledge, this will almost certainly add more scares and humour all on its own.Overall Rating: 3/10",

            "content": "Jason X is a letdown, no doubt about it.  The trailer for the film looked like it would contain some campy fun, but only about the quarter of the movie really lives up to my expectations.  Maybe that is the problem I went into a 'Friday the 13th' film with expectations.The problem suffers the same fate as many horror franchises, lack of creativity.  Just seeing Jason Vorhees on screen is not enough reason to make a sequel.  Give the guy something new to do.  In this film they move Jason to a whole new setting, outer space in the future full of so many options to play with including technology, gravity, cool weapons, etc. but never take advantage of them.  Three quarters of the film could basically be from any of the previous nine films, except this one takes place on a spaceship.  I was hoping that the series would take some serious chances and almost reinvent itself like the campy horror film \"Bride of Chucky\" did. 'Chucky' was joy to sit through.  Sure it's not 'Casablanca', but I was entertained by the fact that I wasn't pedaled the same film as the previous three.  It strayed from the previous three films seriousness and tried some funny scenarios that were more tongue in cheek than I could have expected. 'Chucky' was a success and may have saved the dying series.\nI can't say that about the 'Jason X'.  The film was given the chance and may have blown it.  People don't go to see the old horror franchises to be scared anymore.  Jason, Freddie, and Michael Meyers have become the heroes not the villains.  The directors have to start focusing more on giving the \"villains\" the right attitudes and unique scenarios than trying to make them creepy.  We all know Jason kills, now we want to see what happens when Jason tries to kill in zero gravity.  I thought the producers were going to try some new things with the Jason character in 'Jason Takes Manhattan'.  In the end that film turned out being just another 'F/t13th' film.  In both films 'Jason X' and 'J-Takes-Manhattan' they should have added fish out of water scenarios than looking for scares that never really add up to much.  'Jason X' could have been a hit if people were given something to leave the theatres and talk about.  All horror movie killings are the same.  Fifteen years ago they were a topic for discussion, now we want more than that.  As I said there are some redeeming scenes later in the film, that hit the exact note I was expecting to find throughout the film.  I won't reveal anything, because only if you pay to see this film do you deserve to know.I am sure when you leave the theatre (if anyone else goes to see this) thinking, why didn't they do more fun stuff like in the last 30 minutes? Maybe there were two different directors.  If I had a time machine I would go back ten years and find the guy who wrote 'JX' and put him on the right track.",

Jason X has not been rated (for Germany and for the US), so we saw the full uncut version in all its glory.As I said before, I had no expectations in this film. It took me completely by surprise, when I saw this great roller coaster ride full of fun and gore. Jason X doesn't take itself seriously and plays with the typical elements - just like \"Bride of Chucky\". There are plenty of gore scenes, which are very well done. The story... Well, do you really expect a story or characters? Jason X has only one priority: FUN.I have the feeling, that Jason X is made for the fans. Gore, twisted humor, nice ideas, typical elements (even Crystal Lake apears) and many little things only fans will notice. Everything they expected, they get here.I had a great time watching Jason X.

Before watching the movie I was excited but seriously had some major doubts, I mean Jason in space.. come on who would not have doubts about that? I also had some doubts about the Whole Upgrade Thing. Before I viewed the movie I had the feeling I was either going to give it a Mixed review or a Negative Review. I had no conception of giving this movie a Positive Review.Storyline: I thought the Story Line to Jason X was rather good, it's a change from some other sequels in the Friday the 13th series, but it was way better then \"Jason Goes To Hell\" and \"Jason Takes Manhatten.\" The Movie was slow in certain moments but towards the end of the movie I realized it was for development and foreshadowing of what was to come. The idea of Jason in space I admit scared me a little and I was weary about it, but the writers pulled it off fine and did not go over the top with it and it did not seem to far-fetched.Directing: The director did a good Job with the movie and added some really cool CGI shots in the movie that were not cheesy or to manufactured at all. The CGI shots were rather nice and exciting.Cast: The cast I thought was really good. Fresh faces but also talented. There have been some major bad review concerning the cast in this movie stating they were aweful, but I honestly did not think so. Trust me I have seen WORSE. I thought they played this movie off well and were believable. There was annoying character but Jason obviously did not enjoy him either so I was happy.Kane Hodder (Jason Vorhees): Kane Hodder did once again an Amazing Job in this movie and made Jason so believable. It was also so nice to see Jason killing again. And man being frozen must have made him very angry becuase the Killing Was awesome. To tell you the truth I wasn't all into the whole Jason Gets an upgrade gig, but he was normal Jason with a normal hockey mask through out most of the movie. (by the way Hockey was outlawed in 2020 )\nDeath Scenes: They Were great and creepy. I think the best I have seen in the Friday the 13th Films and the most I believe.The Fans: I think most of the fans will enjoy it. Some may be iffy and in between with it. I dont think many will be disapointed. Oh and the fans will love one really cool part (my fav by the way)... the Crystal Lake sort of Flash Back thing.I recommend Many to go see this in April. I honestly believe it is worth it. I enjoyed it and give it a Positive Review. I give the movie 4.2/5. in other words High B low A.Joe",

The first few minutes start off with the masked wonder and never leave him for very long.  That is the reason that I like this sequel more than any of the other ones.  There really is no break in the action.  I don't want to give anything away, so I will say that there are plenty of original and inventive death scenes, lots of gratuitous eye candy, and an ending that is a triumph of the human spirit. Let me be honest here, this movie has something for everyone.  For the guys it has hot ladies, cool weapons, lots of action, and space marines.  The ladies will also enjoy the film because of the romantic story line between that one guy and his cyborg. What the makers of this film have accomplished is nothing short of a miracle.  It is difficult to take a popular villain and simply place him in space.  For instance, while Leprechaun in Space was a quality film, it pales in comparison to the glory that is Jason X.  Another ingenious move these filmmakers made was putting it so far into the future.  This means they can make many more Jason movies to cover what happened in the years between.In conclusion, go see this movie.  Man's ability to create masterpieces like this gem does not happen every day.  Don't waste your chance to see it, you won't regret it.",

Everyone expected something different of course, something spectacular. If not, it is very hard to wake up interest for a horror figure of the eighties. Everything around Jason X seems to live up to those expectations, but then after seeing the movie you realise nothing has changed. Jason is still Jason, a mass murderer with an Ice-Hockey Mask who doesn't say a word, just kills everyone he meets. In the first place it is not clear why Jason came back from the dead after the \"final\" chapter, Jason Goes To Hell: The Final Friday. Isaacs doesn't worry about explaining this. Besides the beginning goes very fast; we don't see anything of Camp Crystal Lake and Jason is send to space very quickly so you don't have time to analyse the details of his capture. Yes, Jason has been captured and now we find him in space. There the spectator knows it is going to be different, or at least that we be logical.No way. Jason is the same cold killer as in the former movies, kills in the same way and doesn't give any surprises. And when you get finally used to that, he suddenly changes physically,  at a moment the spectator already accepted Jason stayed the same, when he reminds the former parts from the 80's and enjoys those memories. So no one wants this Robocop version of Jason, except the real fans of course (beware of part XI!!).

While I enjoyed Jason X, it was my least favorite of the series for a couple of reasons: 1) I don't like the future aspect. The main reason I liked the series so much was the woods/camp setting and was sad to see they made this one in the future and out in space. 2) The little one liner jokes so typical in today's horror movie. Jokes like that go before the killing  starts maybe, but definitely not during kill scenes. 3) So called ubber Jason, enough said. Ok, reasons why I did like it 1) Pretty good death scenes, some innovative. 2) The movie didn't drag out some, in fact the whole movie seemed pretty action filled, almost too much.Anyways, I just think the space thing has been beat to death. I was hoping this movie would come out and be the starting point to bring some horror like movies of the 80's and depart this late 90's early 00's scream like movies. I am happy it was made, any Jason is better than no Jason. I would love to see more and more movies in this series and the ending looked like they left something to work with if another one is decided upon.Take care and enjoy the movie.",

Sadly, most of the film goes on like this with many things not being explained and we are taken on a magic carpet ride to an ignorant future! Wow! Other than these dissapointing aspects of the film, I found some scenes absolutely hilarious and this is well as it balances the rest of the movie that is horribly confusing and painstakingly slow some times. The retro scene has to be the best as I have never seen something so funny in my entire life. Kudos to the director and editor for that sequence. Also, as with most slasher flicks I expected a lot of T&A however I was greatly dissapointed until that retro scene, as there were next to no nudity in the entire film!!! Sure, the girls were mainly great but still, the only one I wanted to see nude dies 10 minutes into the film. In conclusion, I would give it many pluses to see Jason fling 2 sorority sweethearts around in their sleeping bags in the retro scene, but other then that I have to say that the film was slow, clunky, and horribly boring.",

Hmm, so now 450+ years later some kids on a field trip and find him cryogenically frozen, wow so that's the eternal punishment given by Satan these day being cryogenically frozen at Camp Crystal Lake. I mean do these writers just assume that nobody watched the previous movie. I thought that Jason Goes to Hell was a fairly decent way to close the dynasty.

My friend told me that Jason vs. Freddy is supposed to be a prequel to this, though I haven't heard that.Along with the story, Jason and this girl are frozen in a capsule for over 400 years because of reasons that would be considered spoilers.  When the people from Earth 2 come to visit Earth 1 (which is desolate now) they find one survivor (the girl) and a dead corpse of Jason.  The story complexes as both are brought on the ship, and both come back to life. I will assure you that there are decent killings.

Set in space in the distant future, Jason unleashes his terror upon a space crew, traveling home.

However, those unfamiliar with the original movies should be pleasantly satisfied, watching in awe, engaged in the many scenes of gut-wrenching, senseless, violence and tongue-in-cheek humor.

The ending was horrible. Of all the ways they could have killed Jason, they decided to do it that way. Grant it it is leading up to another movie, but they could have thought of a better ending than that.  I mean with all the recent horror movies that came out the past couple of years weren't that bad. Halloween H2O wasn't all that bad and it had a good story. I never understood why they decided to take the Alien type storyline for this movie. The one good part of the movie was when Jason turned into Cyborg-Jason. The outfit was cool and so was the fact that at the end of the movie he ends up back in Crystal Lake where he first died.  If you want to see this movie because you are Jason Vorhees freak like I am, then I say see it. But if you want to save $8 then stay home and wait for it to come on video and rent it.

Naturally, he gets free, kills some people and stalks the booty-licious scientist that originally wanted him to be cryogenetically frozen.  She accidently freezes herself and Mr. Voorheees.  455 years later, a space crew finds both of them, takes them to their ship and was able to revive the scientist, not Jason.  As you might expect Jason lives anyway and (in violent fashion) all hell breaks loose.This is one of the better films in the seires, but will never be as good as Parts 1 and 6.  It also contains one of the most coolest, original deaths ever that involves nitrogen.  The effects were good, the story good, the acting..... When did that ever matter in an F13 movie anyway?  Kane Hodder once again dominates the Jason persona, especially the brand spaking new \"Uber\" Jason, a large Robot.  This is also the first film in the series that takes the Dark Comedy movie, like so many other franchises today (Nightmare on Elm Street, Child's Play, etc.)Overall this was a good film.  Even non-fans might like it. 7.5 out of 10.",

            "content": "Jason X wasn't terrible.  I hated part 9 (Jason Goes To Hell), so I wasn't annoyed really that there was no explanation given as to how Jason got out of hell since that movie never gave an explanation as to how Jason, who had been turned back into a boy because of the nuclear waste in the New York sewers, actually got back to Crystal Lake from Manhattan.  Maybe someday they can go back to that plot line.  'Till then, maybe they can go back to a somewhat more traditional Friday The 13th movie with the next one.  Earth II's atmosphere has burned off the Uber-Jason crap, so he can look like the big, dirty hick he is if they choose.  It's just too bad that the original hockey mask, which had been pretty faithfully recreated in every sequel since it came into being in part 3, had to get blown up on the space ship.This movie was not scary.  Maybe it wasn't supposed to be.  It lacked in suspense for some reason.  In this movie, pretty much from the get-go, the people know there is a killer on the loose, they know who the killer is, and they know what he looks like.  He's actually being hunted.  What made the first 8 movies good (for the most part) is the people being killed don't know what's going on (except for the final 3 or so people that are left towards the end of the movie).  They're not expecting it, so it's more suspenseful or scary for the audience.I think this movie LOOKED good at least.  It's not going to look AS dated 20 years from now as the original Fridays do.  As most people have said, the best kill is the smashed frozen head.  Along with the virtual killing of the girls in the sleeping bags (which was done in part 7, and was the best killing in that movie).  The music in the virtual Crystal Lake scene...getting back to the classic atmosphere...was a welcome change.  I hadn't really noticed the music at all throughout the movie, but when the classic sound returned, it really hit home how important this was to the early films, and how it should return in future films.I wouldn't rank this sequel too high.  Better than the last one, and perhaps better than 8 and 5, but even those two had some scares.  This one may get the edge because it looks good and for the virtual Crystal Lake scene. Part 6 is by far the best though, despite not having Corey Feldman come back as Tommy.  But I've got high hopes for the next installment.  As long as the campers on Earth II don't know what's happening till about 3/4 of the way through the movie, and if they put in a few \"easy scares\" like the cat jumping through the window, I'll be happy.  Actually just leave the \"magic knife\" crap from part 9 out of it and I'll be happy.",

The first couple are actually somewhat scary, but after Jason's first official \"death,\" the films became pure emphasis on kills.Jason X lacks the suspense of its predecessors, but it provides just as much, if not more fun than most of them.  It doesn't take itself seriously, which is good.  Around 10 movies it's hard to take something like this seriously.  Some sequences are outright hilarious, such as the homage to the sleeping bag death scene from part 7.This was my first experience of Jason in the theaters, and I must say it was magic.  I got stuck with a crowd that were all fans of ole Jay.  There were cheers at each kill scene; some cheers, I even initiated.  It was a lot of fun.  As a devout horror fan, I came close to shedding a tear by the time the night was over.  It was just magic to me.  Jason X was so much fun and is an homage and parody on itself and the genre.Great ending as well.  My only problem was the lack of suspense, but I think the film made up for it just fine.  I loved it.",

I don't think Jason X is one of the worst movies of this year but it certainly isint better then the other Friday The 13th films i think this one can relate to Friday The 13th Part V: A New Begining because i think that was one of the worst films of all time.So all i have to say is the movie could of haved more special effects and more Graphic Killings.

Of course, this film won't win any awards for originality (or anything else for that matter), but never-the-less it's a pretty fun ride to watch which includes some hilariously bad one-liners (\"it'll take more than a poke in the ribs....\"). At first glance, the prospect of the film being set in space seems a somewhat... well... rubbish one, mainly because horror films in outer space seems rather dated these days and doesn't often pay off *ahem leprechaun 4*, but I think this only adds to the film's limited charm. Because of this we get a breath of fresh air for the Friday franchise, finally getting away from the now tedious Camp Crystal Lake and giving the fans something new to look at. I liked this film but honestly, the \"uber-Jason\" resembles a power ranger on steroids.my rating: 6/10",

The fact however is that even though I accept it was making fun of itself it didn't make it funny. It was tiring to sit through some thing that is obvious from the outset. Just because it was meant to be obvious doesn't stop it being boring. I feel the space setting and also the future setting could have been funny but the one liners were constantly playing on the fact that people in the future are stupid.

I thought the cast was entertaining, and while the characters weren't super interesting, I feel that they still had a good screen presence. The final girl Rowan was pretty good, but I think there was more that could've been done with her, especially with her being frozen in time with Jason for 455 years at the start of the movie. I think they could've fleshed out her character better in that respect, but otherwise she was pretty badass. It was cool seeing big time horror director David Cronenberg cameo in the movie as a doctor trying to study Jason. I thought the futuristic space setting was a nice change of pace for a franchise that was running on fumes at the time. The Jason in this movie is awesome and a significant step up from Jason Goes to Hell, especially when he is cybernetically enhanced near the end and becomes \"Uber-Jason\". The kills were awesome in this movie as well, with the standout being the liquid nitrogen kill. The ending with Jason plummeting to another Earth, implying that he will start a rampage once again on a new planet is neat too. I think the critics and fans that lambast this movie into the ground are taking it way too seriously.

Also, aside from Jason, the only character I actually cared about was Sgt. Brodski. The rest I didn't really care. Uber Jason should have appeared more and I wanted at least 5 minutes of Jason vs Brodski.

Why not take the franchise into space? It seems like the most logical step after not being able to create a good film since the first one.\nIn the year 2010, Jason Voorhees (Kane Hodder) is captured by the United States government and held at the Crystal Lake Research Facility. Government scientist Rowan LaFontaine (Lexa Doig) decides to place Jason in frozen stasis after several failed attempts to kill him. A breach is made, and Rowan is frozen alongside Jason for 455 years. Now aboard a ship in the far future they are both regenerated, and Jason continues his killing.\nThis is the tenth film in this series, and it's the 21 Century. Why can we still not get good actors? That's not to say the acting was bad, it was like it is in all of these movies, cheesy but suitable for what the actors are trying to accomplish. It's sad to see Kane Hodder leave after his fourth and final appearance in this film, he is my favorite Jason by far, really bringing this character to new levels.\nI know that this isn't the best movie, and it does have a lot wrong with it realism wise and with continuity. God is it entertaining though! There's so much to love. The claustrophobia of the spacecraft, the tongue in cheek humour, the nerdy aspects of the film's vision. If nothing else, you need to appreciate the boldness in Jim Isaac to do a movie like this.\nOverall, this may just be a guilty pleasure of mine, I know critics hated this one even more than \u2018Friday the 13th: A New Beginning' which I do not understand at all. If nothing else, this movie is so entertaining and true to the character of Jason you can forgive all the cheesy humor and unnecessary scenes that should have been cut. Watch this movie and have fun, that's what it's for.\n3.5/5",

Murder and mayhem of this sort quickly becomes monotonous. After a brief setup, Jason starts his rampage. One-by-one, the characters are picked off, until, at the end, a plucky heroine or manly hero dispatches him (temporarily). Most of Jason X takes place on a spaceship which to me is wasted opportunity to take the series into better directions (straight camp).",

I even went to see it a bunch of times during it's original release.\n\nTheres so much to love. The claustrophobia of the spacecraft, the tongue in cheek humour, the nerdy aspects of the film's vision (check out the eye operation on Jason and the way that injuries like severed limbs are remedied).\n\nTheres also an amazing cameo by David Cronenberg thats worth the price of admission alone.\n\nWith this installment being based in space theres many nods to satify the most ardant sci-fi fanboys. Least not Lisa Ryder who was a star of Andromeda. Her android character is a great addition to the cast.\n\nUber Jason is a sight to behold!\u00a0And check out the liquid nitrogen kill.

This movie has arguably the thinnest p[lot to date for any Jason movie. In the beginning, he has finally been captured and those who hold him decide he is to be frozen. Then in a moment of utter stupidity, the government decides to keep him warm and study him.  Once that predictably backfires immediately, he is consequently frozen in a cryostasis chamber with his latest victim also being frozen just outside his tomb. Apparently nobody thought to go in to this building for over 450 years. A scavenger team looking for anything salvageable on the old Earth stumble upon these two. Once on their ship, they repair and revive the woman and begin analysis of Jason. Once again, not thinking about the consequences leads to Jason reeking havoc upon the many people on the ship. The outfits are interesting, though the women wearing extremely revealing clothing throughout the film just seemed like a way for the director to have near nudity since there really was no direct nudity for the crew members. This movie jumbles around trying to make it cool that Jason is in space but it fails to truly capture the magic that could have been Jason in Space. The new Jason that the ship creates haphazardly looks pretty awesome with the metal mask, metal body and demonic eyes. The best death is the first one to occur on the spaceship and the death's get continuously less appealing as the film goes on, including the murder of a female soldier that happens completely off screen but we see the aftermath right after. They even set it up for there to be more Jason movies based on this iteration of the character as he crashes into a lake on Earth-2. This movie could have been amazing if the characters were the kind of people you would actually want to survive or at least not wish death upon.",

Completely ignoring the ending of Jason Goes to Hell -\nThe Final Friday (1993) this Jason looks more like the older Jason of the third and fourth films. I digress. Anyways, a scientist named Rowan (Lexa Doig) insists they put Jason into a cryogenic frozen slumber. As in most movie this doesn't work and everyone is killed except for Rowan and Jason. Rowan tricks Jason into the machine, but is stabbed in the process. Fast forward 445 years later to the year 2455 and a group of Students led by a man named Professor Lowe (Jonathan Potts) discover Jason and Rowan perfectly preserved. In the future the Earth is a barren wasteland and no one lives there anymore apparently. Well they Revive Rowan and of course Jason comes back wrecking havoc and murdering all the horny students one by one. And boy do I mean horny this movie literally feels at time like a softcore porno. That mixed with the incredibly shitty acting and low production makes for a very hard watch.

They try to copy off elements of the Alien series but that horribly fails. As it looks like it's made for a TV movie on FX or spike the CGI looks horrid. There is not much character development in the movie as you just see them in one scene and get killed the next. The kill scenes are actually well put together, the gore may look like it's strawberry jam but hey they put a lot of work into that when it comes to making bad slashers. \n\nOverall the movie is of course made for the money and we should just let this series die off and put it to rest.

Following in the hallowed footsteps of Leprechaun 4, Hellraiser: Bloodline and Critters 4, this installment finds Jason cryogenically frozen for four hundred years and defrosted aboard a lightly-staffed spacecraft. No explanation is offered for his abrupt return from the depths of the nether, where he was unceremoniously dumped at the end of Jason Goes to Hell, though I'm not sure that really would've made a difference. This is a willfully stupid playground for half-baked science fiction ideas, terrible wardrobe choices and budget special effects; a cut-rate production that would feel right at home on the Sci-Fi Channel at 3am. Predictable to the end, it touches all the bases with gratuitous nudity, shallow characters, mysterious returns from certain doom and a truckload of dismemberments / decapitations / deaths. The only thing we're missing is the trademarked screeching cat fake-out, presumably because no self-respecting animal would be seen in such a production. Apart from one fleeting moment of self-deprecating parody near the end - which is totally out of place, but admittedly had me howling - there's no reason for this to exist. It's the kind of thing that would've thrived on the bootleg circuit, akin to Roger Corman's unreleased Fantastic Four, but by actually sending it to theaters, New Line took the wind out of those sails.

The film is popular enough to become a franchise and spawn several sequels of varying quality and generally inferior to the one that started it all off.\n\nDue to the location and incorporating space and sci-fi, on top of all the expected 'Friday the 13th' elements then some, 'Jason X' is certainly different and a little credit is due for that. For a 'Friday the 13th' film it and 'Jason Takes Manhattan' are pretty unique as far as the series goes. 'Jason X' is an example of different not really being a good thing.\n\nInteresting idea and understand totally what the film was trying to do, but it was messily executed. The strengths and faults are pretty much the same as with the previous entry 'Jason Goes to Hell', excepting 'Jason X' is marginally better because it tried to be different.\n\nA couple of creative and disturbing deaths and some inventive and stylish camera work lift 'Jason X' to a better level.\n\nOne good performance too, which comes from Kane Hodder. Again creeping and chilling the socks off the viewer as Jason.\n\nHowever, those are the only praises really that can be given. The music is a little appealing on the ears, but it still doesn't have the eeriness and mystery that the pre-'Jason Goes to Hell' films had so brilliantly and doesn't fit as adeptly.\n\nThat is the least bad though of the drawbacks, which are pretty much the same as those of the worst 'Friday the 13th' films but even worse than before. Again, like 'Jason Goes to Hell', while a good deal of 'Friday the 13th' films are silly, the silliness here is overkill that it becomes insultingly ridiculous. 'Jason X' is one of the most unique conceptually of the series, but it sure is one of the strangest to the point of overdone weirdness.\n\n'Jason X' tonally feels muddled and like it was trying to do too much with too many elements screaming of kitchen-sink. If it tried to do less it would perhaps have been a better film. Hodder aside, the acting is really horrendously amateur hour, even for the 'Friday the 13th' films where acting rarely was a strength.\n\nLikewise with the dialogue, which is even worse than 'Jason Goes to Hell', with 'Friday the 13th' at its most taking-simplicity-to-extremes, stilted, cheesiest and lacking in taste. Scariness and suspense is nil, instead going for witless comedy and gratuitous gore and nudity. The deaths go for quantity rather than quality, and generally are not particularly imaginative or creepy. The story is paper thin and confused, with too hectically paced storytelling and there is the sense that the series has gotten really stale even with a change in location.\n\nOverall, lame. 3/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "We've hit the reset button yet again. Jason X is another one-off entry in the series which largely ignores what came before and changes things so much that no film picked up where it left off. Horror sequels tend to function ineffectively in a vacuum and Jason X is no exception, it's a tough watch.\n \nI never realized it before but in many ways this film is a futuristic remake of Jason Takes Manhattan. Think about it, most of the action takes place on a ship, Jason is surrounded by undergraduates, there's a professor/student seduction scene, Jason's makeup is lacking, and it's all god-awful rubbish. I don't understand the thinking here. The last two films took Jason away from camp and both were huge failures with the fan base, how can you make this mistake a third straight time? \n \nOnce again I'll state the obvious: Jason in space is a dumb idea. I've heard this film described as \"Jason for the Matrix generation\" and maybe that's true. Jason X was built around a futuristic aesthetic using all sorts of CGI shots of space flight and sci-fi weaponry and, you know what, who cares? Since when did people watch these films for the digital effects? The answer is never. The filmmakers even go so far as to create an android character who looks like Carrie-Anne Moss's Trinity and include a rapid-cut fight scene with her and Jason near the end of the film. The idea that an audience member would be thrilled or entertained by this makes me ill.\n \nMuch like Jason Goes to Hell this film comes off as more of an action-focused production and doesn't much bother with suspense or scares, not even cheap ones. A good example of this would be the second act which involves a team of trained commandos tracking Jason through a spaceship like in Alien. Of course their expertise is wasted on the stealthy Jason who, despite being bulky and rancid smelling, can sneak up on anyone at any time and slash his way out of the situation. It's a dull charade.\n \nI find it interesting that, although they were all major studio releases, Friday the 13th films are often thought of as B-movies. Jason X is probably the closest any of these sequels come to actually fulfilling that expectation. Poor costuming, set design, and visual effects make Jason X a film that generates groans and eye rolls as often as ironic laughter. It's another tedious, uninspired sequel in what has quickly become a marathon of unwatchable dreck.",

I know lots of the Friday the 13th movies follow a pretty basic slasher formula, but the good ones always have something inventive to keep it interesting. In this the characters are a bit bland, and the plot is uninspired feeling copy-pasted from any of a slew of scifi movies like this one, but overall it's still an enjoyable film. It's cheesy and gory and that's all it really tries to be. 44/100",

Granted, some jokes work quite well, from Jason pausing to decide which machete to use to the hologram made to distract him.  The acting is nothing to write home about and as usual, it's Kane Hodder's imposing presence as Jason that is the best performance.  Plus, you get another set of decent kills (the campground scene is a classic).  Not a classic or even the best in the franchise (that's still Part VI) but a fun viewing.",

All of the cast cloths look like they're going out on a Saturday night, not on a space ship in 2455. Oh yeah they keep saying one character was frozen for OVER 445 years, but its exactly 445 years. It may sound like a pet peeve but that really pisses me off. It makes some bad one liners and obvious jokes. It tries to be over-the-top but its still takes itself serious and that never works. The suspense isn't really there, its more action and it feels wrong. Jason get resurrected and looks absolutely ridiculous. The cast is nearly forgettable. Lisa Ryder and Kristi Angus were the only two characters that were any fun but the rest of the cast pulls them down to their level of badness. The special effects are so poor they're actually laughable. \"Jason X\" is defiantly the lowest point in the \"Friday the 13th\" series and one of the worst films i've experienced in quite a while.",

Other movies like Dracula 3000, Leprechaun in Space and things like that were unnecessary and dumb. This movie fits right with them.\n\nI remember that night, shortly after watching it, I looked up why this was made. It turned out that they wanted to spew out a Jason film in cinemas for a filler before Freddy vs Jason came out. So I'm just spitballing here but... I think they just had one guy say \"Oh, lets put him in space for no apparent reason! DURHUR!\"\n\nSeriously?! Why Space?! I understand trying to get something fresh and new out but at least be more original then just space! It totally confuses us for how it links to Freddy vs Jason (if it was even counted as being in the series unless they realized they were stoned coming up with this and then found out it was a bad idea so they just tried to cover it up.)\n\nI don't want to get into detail about this movie because its no oscar or memorable film. Lets just say everyone involved wanted your money. Acting was bad, Story is dumb, Characters are unlikable, SFX are cheese but.... There are just a few positives to this\n\nSome of the kills are pretty decent and Cyber Jason was pretty cool looking. That's about it and it actually redeemed a star for that... \n\nOverall, Jason X is a silly, stupid movie. I would only watch it if there is absolutely nothing on tv and you have nothing to do on a late night. Other than that, avoid it at all costs.",

            "content": "Okay, pop quiz: What could make Jason Voorhees go from a high-ranked horror icon to a jerk-off horror whore? Everything that they did in this movie.\n\nWhile I like how James wanted to change the setting from Crystal Lake and appeal more to the science fiction genre rising in the early 2000's (The 6th Day, Mission to Mars, X-Men, etc.) but the way he did so is nothing short of cliche. As a fan of the classic horror icons, I felt that this would be a game changer in the genre of futuristic horror but I was sadly mistaken. What Jason X basically did was take an already immortal killer, put him in a Star Trek ship decked out in chrome, and then made him more immortal and even harder to kill than in the last dozen films he was in before. All in all, Jason X was just an excuse to whore out both Jason and the science fiction genre in one nice little film, if you could call it that. Instead of adapting Jason to his new, futuristic world, they kept him as the blade-wielding undead killer he was before only they decked him in chrome and armor, made his 20-times stronger than he should be, and gave him interesting new knives to play with and the ability to regenerate. Other than that, this was basically same, old Jason in the same scenario as in any Friday the 13th film except set in a spaceship completely isolated from Earth instead of the typical camp by the lake.\n\nAll in all, Jason X is basically taking Friday the 13th, putting it on a spaceship, decorate it in chrome, and decking out Jason to make him even harder to kill. Saying now, if you're looking for a new take on sci-fi/horror and your considering this film to add to your list. Turn back now, you are making a grave mistake.",

Jason is still super pissed off even though he gets a complete upgrade due to a great tissue reconstruction machine that pimps him up better than if he had spent a month with X-Zibit and his crew on Pimp My ride! anyways the film is filled with references to the previous film of the franchise, the tone is slightly comedic and the film feel rather like a cheap action space flick than a real horror outtake. The franchise started great with Sean S. Cunnigham in the directing seat, Steve Miner kept things ok for the sequel but went pretty awol with the third episode. After that it's been constant non sense, grotesque and incredibly uninteresting plot stories mere excuses for an insane amount of body count and other rather interesting death by the boogeyman. Jason X shows some interesting ideas but overall it's pretty bad and lacking any real artistic value or interest. It's really too bad that Horror in the United States is perceived as something so cheap. Other cultures such as the Japanese one manage to create horror movies that have good stories and great thrills. The genre need a complete turn over and a much needed resurrection in the land of uncle Sam.... I am curious to see which film is going to bring back from it's ashes a great genre that has fallen into complete disgrace for the last 20 years.",

Folks go in to making a 'so bad it's good' movie intentionally but miss what makes those kinds of films enjoyable. This is the only one where I was nodding off. There was only one victim that I cared about( hell, cant even remember his name). The rest were either bland or kind of terrible people.  There is a very lack luster fight scene which could have been good but wasn't handled well. None of the kills were memorable. Well, one kind of was but it was while Jason was in a simulation and was copying a previous gem so that hardly counts. The only reason I am giving this nothing less than a 2 is that it at least had Jason, in space, killing folks. No matter how poorly it handled, it at least did it. You could have been so much more movie, so much more. Oh, and I was going to give it a 2.5, but then Uber-Jason. Ya, the less said about that the better. Just, ew.",

Maybe it was the unique setting that gave me some hope, but it seems that hope was grossly misplaced. The story takes place in a creatively devoid future, but the story is still stuck in the freakin' past. All the cliches are here: the stupid characters, the couple who's always screwing, the indestructible killer, and everything in between! There's nothing new here! The only good thing about this movie is that it makes fun of the formula of its predecessors. This would actually be pretty cool if the movie itself actually differed from the movies it was making fun of. It's just kind of shitting on itself at that point. If you want to get any enjoyment out of this movie, watch it as a comedy as opposed to a horror movie.

It is a perfect movie to watch if you have never seen any of the previous entries as it only briefly mentions past events and the story doesn't really follow on from any of the previous movies.  Jason has changed as well, and is no longer referred to as a zombie and now is classed as a man with super regenerative powers!  The story is just so outlandish that it borders on the ridiculous, but it is so well acted and directed that it becomes a huge piece of cheese in all the right ways with a prefect mix of action, horror and comedy.  The characters all stand out and finally veer away from the generic slackers that have featured in a lot of the previous entries, and it is always a pleasure to see Kane Hodder returning as Jason.

There is some good CGI effects, especially when Jason puts a girl head in the liquid nitrogen and then he bashs her head! and the highlight, of course. When Jason enters the virtual reality room towards the end. Even David Cronenberg makes an amusing cameo in the opening sequence. Intentionally funny, most of the time although Todd Farmer (My Bloody Valentine-2009, Drive Angry) is no comedy writer. Since his original script was more darker and more violent in tone. Some good moments, here and there. Despite some serious flaws, some fans hated the goofy tone of the movie but once you set Jason in space, what can you do? Just accept as a campy horror movie and have fun with it. Most of the canadian cast are quite likeable. This is good, guilty pleasure fun! Hodder is good as always as Jason.",

The sight of seeing Jason being reanimated is a strange delight, seeing him slick and updated makes him a true killer. The worst thing about this is again, the acting, except for Lexa Doig as Rowan, who is pretty good but only noticable because the rest are rubbish. Jason gets a futuristic makeover and annihilates someone using a giant screwing tool. After sitting through Jason's latest exploits, the audience may find itself identifying with that victim in particular.

            "content": "Jason X is a hell of a good time. Most people would contend that the idea of sending Jason into the future and space could very well be the worst idea in the history of the series. Well, that's not totally inaccurate. I had the same reaction when I first heard about it. It's actually very well-made, and much more engaging and interesting than the previous three sequels (especially Jason Goes to Hell). There isn't much in the way of standard Friday the 13th story fodder either. There's no one with deep psychological problems trying to defeat Jason, no gratuitous sex or nudity scenes and there's no sense of suspense or build-up to it anymore. Why is that a good thing? In this context, these films are so played out that a sequel that tries to be genuinely suspenseful would just fall flat on its face. This film is having fun with the series, and it shows. Hell, they even have a scene that pays homage to The New Blood when Jason walks into a holodeck-type area and is made to believe that there are a couple of teenagers looking to party and have sex. He immediately bashes them while they're in their sleeping bags, and the entire scene is funny and enjoyable. They also have a similar scene earlier in the film where Jason walks into the same area and thinks he's killed one of the main characters, just to find that it was all a computer simulation. He immediately afterwards kills the character for real. There's also a bit of set up and pay off, or even building up the reality of the film. Early on, when they first discover Jason's frozen corpse, he's accidentally knocked over and cuts off one of the character's arms. Causing little to no fuss, they use a futuristic method of cauterizing the wound, bring the severed arm with them, and re-attach it on the ship. It seems frivolous but it actually sets up that these people have the technology to combat things like severed limbs or damaged tissue. It also sets up the nanobots table, which are little mechanical spiders that are used to bring the frozen lead actress back to life, repairing damaged tissue in the process. It's also, of course, used to the enth degree with Jason later in the film. This is also another entry where everybody knows about Jason early on, which I like. In all actuality, there's no way to really do a sequel to this series (or a remake, for that matter) without it being laughed at and looked down on. It's when the filmmakers have a passion for it and try to do something creative and fun with it that it's most effective, which is the case with Jason X.",

The acting is not all that, and they even have a ten cent version of William Shatner to round out the cast, but it is cool seeing an Asian actress in the lead. The climax is beyond dumb when Jason gets regenerated into Uber Jason, but he does look intimidating as hell.

            "content": "In the 80's, the slasher movie was the undisputed king of the horror genre. With the Halloween franchise laying dormant until the late 80's, the ruler of this genre was Jason Voorhees. But while the Friday The 13th franchise cranked out movies nearly once a year throughout the 80's, they stopped being scary in 1984 with Friday The 13th: The Final Chapter, which was supposed to be the end of the series.\r\n\r\nAfter The Final Chapter, the series shifted gears and went from making Jason the monster you feared, into the hero you rooted for. You no longer hid in fear over how Jason would dispatch his victims. Instead you couldn't wait to see it. They became more party movies than horror movies. They didn't even try to scare you. I have to believe that this was intentional. It's what the audiences wanted. The filmmakers couldn't outgrow the cliches they themselves had created, so they embraced them, and amped up the overkill. Literally.\r\n\r\nWith this movie, the filmmakers had to know how utterly ridiulous the premise was. \"Jason In Space\" is something that would be laughed off the screen if they tried to take it seriously. Thankfully, they did not. It's a campy sci-fi movie with it's tongue so firmly planted in its cheek, that it threatens to punch right through.\r\n\r\nThe characters are as wafer thin as they ever have been. Except these teens of the future are horny young scientists on a futuristic field trip to \"old Earth\", instead of horny summer camp counselors. When they discover the cryogenically frozen body of Jason, and the uber-hot scientist accidentally frozen with him, they take the bodies back aboard their ship, thaw them out, and that party really gets started.\r\n\r\nKane Hodder returns for his fourth, and final appearance as Jason. Hodder's hulking form has served the character well, and he is the person that has given Jason the most personality over the years. Here he once again gladly dispatches of those pesky young people in both his classic, machete wielding ways, and in new ways that are provided by the sci-fi setting.\r\n\r\nThere are many funny lines and references to past Jason outings throughout the movie. A virtual reality Camp Crystal Lake segment is especially fun. Some classic kills are re-created with a sick humorous twist, and and unwitting victim delivers one of the great lines of the franchise \"It's ok guys, he just wanted his machete back.\"\r\n\r\nThis is a movie that totally divided the Friday The 13th fanbase. It's so far removed from the original creation that, to some, it bordered on blasphemy. But you have to judge it on it's own merits. Is it scary? Hell, no. But I don't believe it was ever intended to be. It was meant to be fun roller coaster ride with familiar happenings in an unfamiliar setting. It's a popcorn movie, and a fun one at that.",

The horribly written characters of this film basically translate into The Breakfast Club in space with Jason.  Yes, that's right: in space.  And did I mention that it is 450 years in the future?  Let me save you some time - Jason is on a spaceship with a bunch of people from the future and he kills all of them.  I really wish that I was making this up.  If the horrible concept wasn't enough, this film is filled with absurd one-liners that place the film in limbo somewhere between comedy and slasher film.  When you use the line \"He's screwed\" to describe a character who was killed by falling onto a giant drill, you know that the writers are just making fun of the film.  Did I mention that it takes place in space?  The only redeeming quality (and I use that term very loosely) is the casting of Lexa Doig, who is VERY nice to look at.  But what is the point when you keep on shooting something at close range and he just gets back up and kills you?  If there is no realistic (or even unrealistic) way to kill the villain, the plot disappears and you are left with 90 minutes of a guy in a hockey mask killing a bunch of people and then some closing credits.  It isn't even scary because the idea of Jason running around on a spaceship is so ludicrous.  Oh yeah, by the way, they are in space.  \"Jason X\" is laughable and truly a testament to the fact that the writers have given up on this film franchise and decided that the only way to make any more money off of it is by turning it into a joke.  It certainly has fallen a long way since the 80's.  And just to warn you, this movie takes place in outer space.",

I wouldn't be surprised if they just popped in royalty free music CD. All of the kills are hack and slash and there's only a single memorable one, which isn't even that good if you've seen Terminator 2. The computer generated effects of the kills and the spaceships are awful; I've seen Sega Genesis games that look better. It's scare and startle-free and you will forget the name of any character mere seconds after someone says it. Even as a comedy, this movie fails horribly. The one mildly amusing part with the sleeping bag \"death\" wont register a laugh because you're pissed off at the rest of the movie. I haven't seen every Friday the 13th movie, but I bet you the rest of them feel like they're part of a series. Jason X is like Highlander: The Source to the Highlander franchise; yes, it has the brand name and a minimum of one recognizable character, but it's incredibly lousy and pisses on its fans. And I'm not even a fan of the series, so I can't imagine how infuriated fans of this movie were when they saw it!

Beyond that, this film has lackluster acting, it is way too sexist for it to have any kind of decency and... It's just stupid. The first ten minutes of the film, before they jump in time, are its best minutes. The scenery is cool-looking, you actually get to see Jason Voorhees again and you'll get this oh-shit-feeling when he is cryogenicly suspended. And after he and the woman wake up... It's all downhill from there, and that's saying something when even the best minutes were worth perhaps two and a half stars. So yeah, this film blows monkeys.

All of the movies suck. There are 3 or 4 movies, I consider watchable; that's not to say they are likable. The whole series is shit. All of them are, for the most part, the exact same movie. There's nothing on the level of suspense because we've seen the movie before, the first 9 times it was done and guess what it sucked then too. I love how the makers of these movies think anyone gives a flying fuck about Jason. There's nothing scary about a retard who won't die.\n\nJason X is definitely the worst idea in the franchise, but the sum total is a little more watchable then Jason Goes to Hell and Jason Takes Manhattan. I'd probably rank this as the third worst in the series. But it did give the viewers some valuable information for the future. One is that hockey is going to be outlawed in about 30 years. So everyone in North Dakota better get their hockey on hard for the next few decades. Another is that the future intergalactic researchers are going to be stupid, hot chicks with nice perky breasts, which means, we're fucked.\n\nThere's nothing about this movie that can be considered entertaining. The special effects were some of the worst you'll ever see. The acting and dialogue was right down there with the rest of the series. No scares and no suspense kind of sums up this movie pretty well, and for that matter the entire franchise.",

That is an idea that when properly executed could've resulted in a brilliantly shlocky and hilariously entertaining film, but instead Jason X opts to just suck. Most of the characters all share one personality, by which I mean they have none beyond throwing out sarcastic one-liners, and ninety-five perfent of the jokes fall flat, leaving the only kinda funny parts to be the sometimes pretty entertaining kills. But even with a few kinda cool kills, the film never really utilizes the possibilities of putting Jason in the future on a spaceship, and instead just does a typical Friday the 13th slasher. The setting has no significant impact on the action, so basically the same movie could've been done as a classic Friday the 13th film by just replacing words like \"space\" in the script with \"Camp Crystal Lake\". Honestly the idea of Jason in space would've been much more suited for a splatter film than a slasher film. When the movie came out I was like ten years old and was too young to see it, so when I saw the trailer I just imagined the movie in my head, and I still find the one ten-year-old me came up with better than the actual one. They should've just gone all out and given Jason like a laser machete and had him have a lightsaber duel or something and give all the characters blasters and shit... You know, just go all out on the stupid sci-fi shit like something like Moonraker did (although granted that's not a good movie either). In the end the only thing Jason X truly got right is Uber Jason which is one of the coolest things ever in the history of anything ever.\n\n5-/10",

Yell-o, Sleaze Boy blasts into space to look for neon Jason in Jason X. \r\n\r\nJason X \r\nIt's been a while since Jason has been seen in Jason Goes to Hell, but now his time is done and returns to earth to participate in a space program. Jason X is a bad, bad movie. It's better than New Blood or Jason Takes Manhattan in acting and spirit wise, but it surpasses stupidity than both of those films. The flick is clumsy beyond redeeming bounds or value. It's incompetent, inept, insipid, gloriously moronic, and a lot more. Did I mention it's incredibly stupid by a new record? The film suffers from the obvious bad writing, characters, plot, development, cinematography, suspense, and logic, but suffers with bad special effects and that takes a toll. The special effects have always meant something in Friday the 13th flicks as we gather up to see a new way of slashing, stabbing, dicing, and other deaths. However, here the CGI is fairly obvious that a preschooler can tell the obvious cheapness and have, for whomever, memories back to the 50's when two paper plates with strings were used for flying saucers. \r\n\r\n2010 \r\nThe film opens up in 2010 as Jason is held captive by a small military unit with commanding officers and team of scientist bent on using him despite scientist Rowan's objection. They visit to transport him, but are killed off when Jason breaks free. Rowan, the final girl, reacts quickly by defeating Jason in placing him in a capsule to be cryogenically frozen. Victory, apparently not, is cut or stabbed when Jason pierces Rowan from leaving out the door. The two are frozen. \r\n\r\n2455 \r\nThe frozen bodies are discovered after a group of students with an accompanying professor. They find Jason first, and we learned that hockey has been outlawed for some odd reason, goodbye dentist. Anyways, the students find Rowan and take both of them to a spaceship, but not before its accidents. Anyways, we go to the spaceship and learn it is filled with sex crazed students running around having fun. I can't remember if any of them were doing drugs, but that's not the point. Among unfreezing the two, the chaos begins. I was amazed that stupidity flourishes throughout the future. We begin with Professor Lowe as he is told by a financial adviser that human from the past is worth a lot of money. However, the killer Jason Voorhees is worth a lot more. I am guessing the financial backer has seen some of the Friday the 13th films. Wanting to profit, Lowe has Jason unfrozen despite Rowan's objection and once again, chaos ensues. I cannot remember who, but Jason wakes up as female scientist Adrienne has her back turned and echoes of sadomasochism. This scene is amusing as it is tasteless.  Anyways, Jason wakes up delivers the first and best kill since 445 years as he holds Adrienne's face in liquid nitrogen and smashing her face in bits. \r\n\r\nNow that Jason has been brought back to life and ready to slash, I am going to make ephemeral talking about what goes on next. The crew is unaware of Jason, so it allows us to relax and enjoy the insightful view of stupidity and death. Students and staff are picked off one by one as they commit all the errors that lead to death in a slasher film. There is an attempt of resistance as a number of folks with brief personalities battle Jason only to die. I guess they did not receive the memo of Jason's ability to regenerate loss skin tissue or damage. Anyways, folks are picked off one by one as they wander around in the dark yelling out names. It is no surprise. Anyways, we get the whole \"Ten Little Indians\" concept as it boils down to the final girl, but I was surprised as the flick took a few positive turns. A handful of people make it out alive only to learn the spaceship is damaged and ready to blow up. There is an improvement around here when battle takes place between Jason Voorhees and a sexy android known as the KM-14. The battle scene is loaded with laughs and excitement that doesn't save the flick. The film looks like it's clear for ending, but another twist appears. This twist is ludicrous outstretching the flick until the ending secured, uneven. Jason has landed on Earth 2, kill-k-kill. \r\n\r\n2011/present \r\nI return to the first paragraphs the film's flaws as it is pervasive. I could go on with a large list enough to be a single roll of toilet paper, but that will be boring. The necessity to get intricate in criticism is not required because the intelligence and structure is frivolous. Its absurdity and sullen style can be spotted within the opening. However, a Jason flicks have always perverse itself with a dark sense of humor overtime, so I forgive it on that part. At this moment, I flurry into the film's positive. Its triumph relies in vulgarity and stupidity. They mesh together and polish the film near it's so bad it's good. There's a great cheap scene with the ship colliding with a station known as Solaris. Awfulness is pretty funny throughout including two gaudy scenes that's a new record in my book. I cannot describe it completely as I am tempted to tell you watch the film or spoil all. However, I can allow hints and winks when we see KM-14's envy during one scene and two sexy girls' valiant resistance and mutual endeavor with Jason. Indeed, this fun and humorous if you are tolerant to this behavior. I could only have hoped for a brief romanticism in the flick. Aesthetic meets schlock in bowl of blood with limps floating. An attempt to bring a sort of innocence to the young adults in the spaceship as crew and staff bite their nails. Added correctly with writing, direction, and mood, the film would have made an adult feel like a kid. I admit I found myself in this position. It is sad, however, that I must return from fantasy to finish this flick. \r\n\r\nWe are left with a too long journey as the flick tries to be serious at times with eclectic elements from better flicks. The list is not long, but I thought the following: Alien (A), Blade Runner, Hellraiser: Bloodline (D-), and 2001: A Space Odyssey (A) just to name a few. I can't recall if I saw any Star Wars or Star Trek influences. Anyways, we get themes from the flick, and it is unable to transform itself. Better yet, there is no clear visual to what the film wants to be. Are we supposed to get a scary film gone wrong or is this was an attempt to make a campy and silly flick with optional variation. The weigh questions burdens down the ship. There's trouble with the engine! The cinematography ruins the picture as hinted the use of a cheap digital recording camera. The engine is burning! I was offended by the sight of bad CGI as I began to ponder the comparison between this and legendary Ed Wood films. Okay forget the fire, the engine is gone! I could forgive a bad film if it is pretty funny Texas Chainsaw Massacre- the Next Generation, but Jason X misses, ah!, the mark, squeal, for a recommendable, gah!, opinion, agh!. Yet, I cannot dismiss it, phew.  I enjoyed the documentary The Many Lives of Jason Voorhees and some other cool special features, but it is not enough for mainstream audience to watch. Jason fans will and the opinion will be mixed. \r\n\r\nOther notes: you know a movie is in trouble when fame critic like Roger Ebert uses the word \"suck\" in a review. I understand why original director of Friday the 13th Sean Cunningham produced this flick, but he should have stayed patient or keenly aware of the film. The senescent Jason has shown no sign of retiring.\r\n\r\nFlick written by Todd Farmer and directed Jason Isaac.",

I know your laughing there at that first bit but its true, and i was dissapointed not because the film was flat out bad, but because i didn`t get scared...at all.\r\n\r\nFinally captured in the year 2008, Jason Voorhees (Kane Hodder) is held inside a government research facility whose scientists try to answer the question that keeps eluding them - why one of the most infamous mass murderers in history cannot die. Once Rowan (Lexa Doig), leader of the research project, prepares the specimen for cryogenic suspension, a greedy scientist goes over her head and comes to remove Jason, only to have the mad slasher break free and slaughter him and his entire entourage. Tricking Jason into following her, Rowan eludes him into entering the cryogenic freezer and begins the process, but a breach in the system causes her to freeze with him. The government tries to deny any evidence of the project, and nearly four centuries pass, during which the Earth gradually becomes less and less habitable and humans have relocated to a planet in another star system that they've named Earth II. A team of young students descends onto the ruined Earth, where they find the frozen bodies of Jason and Rowan in the forgotten research facility and take back on board their ship with them. Rowan is thawed and revived, but the team mistakes Jason to be dead, having no idea of his abilities or motives. Before long, Jason awakens to the sound of young people having premarital sex once again, and the carnage erupts once again as the ship proceeds to Earth II. The remaining survivors fight for their lives as the centuries-old mad slasher proves that he is just as evil and just as indestructible during their time as he was centuries before. \r\n\r\nNow where to start...DO NOT TAKE THIS FILM SERIOUSLY AT ALL. The plot is just out there in the realms of fantasy. There is no way that in the year 2455 we will be able to bring people back to life with robotic ants. Second of all, the characters are two dimensional apart from a certain few (and those are the ones who survived). There aint any worthy talent in this film and i ain`t surprised. I only liked 3 of the cast. The Hot girl that died by being sucked out into space, The guy that looks like a young Matthew Perry and The Tough Black Soldier Guy. And Jason X was pretty damn cool, but not amazingly wow Cool.\r\n\r\nI also must mention that The Special Effects are just terrible. They are Early PS2 Graphics and they look incredibly shit. I mean granted its 2001 and CGI wasn`t at the level it is today, but still they could have done a lot better.\r\n\r\nOverall its terrible but can be fun at the same time. While watching it, I had this fun feeling to it. I guess you could watch and enjoy it without taking it seriously in a way. I mean i could when I was 12 or 13 but now i`m 16 and I can just about get through it.\r\n\r\n[b]Rating - 49% - C+[/b]",

While the whole 'Jason in space' thing might seem stupid and silly (as if the series was ever really clever) my main problem with \"Jason X\" is that is just flat out boring. The characters, the kills, the thrills are all pretty dull, they don't even take a chance to make Jason more interesting during his 'upgrade'.

In order to even remotely pull a film like this off you need to have a decent sized budget. Jason X doesn't, in fact it looks like it was made for a fiver.\n\nThe plot is silly and again seems to disregard every film that came before. The year is 2010 and Jason has been captured and is being held at Camp Crystal Lake research facility! Supposedly he has the power to regenerate tissue so is impossible to kill. He is about to be frozen o be manages to escape and kill some soldiers before eventually being put into the chamber and frozen, taking his doctor with him. Flash forward 400 years, Jason is found by a bunch of space junk hunters and brought aboard their spaceship. Needless to say he thaws out and begins another killing spree.\n\nThis idea could have worked if they had a decent budget, setting the story in the future gives the film makers plenty of interesting ways for Jason to kill his victims. Sadly we get one decent kill and then the usual slice and dice. The zero budget means that the sets are terrible, the acting non-existent, the special effects cartoonish, the worst score I have ever heard and simply awful dialogue. Everything about the film is cheap and it's downright boring. It's no longer a horror, it's an action sci-fi with obvious references to aliens. You have to laugh that a film this bad tries to emulate such a classic film. Don't get me started on \"robot\" Jason, it looks terrible and the series died as soon as he came on screen.\n\nSilly silly film, awful production values and downright boring.",

Well, okay, the movie wasn't totally hopeless all the time, but the thing is... It was a total Aliens rip-off! You can't rip off Alien franchise, everyone and their mothers will notice that! Beyond that, this film has lackluster acting, it is way too sexist for it to have any kind of decency and... It's just stupid. The first ten minutes of the film, before they jump in time, are its best minutes. The scenery is cool-looking, you actually get to see Jason Voorhees again and you'll get this oh-shit-feeling when he is cryogenicly suspended. And after he and the woman wake up... It's all downhill from there, and that's saying something when even the best minutes were worth perhaps two and a half stars. So yeah, this film blows monkeys. If you're a die-hard Friday the 13th fan, you might want to see this one, but if you're not... Do not see this one! Especially if you liked the Alien films.",

During the film, Jason is reborn into Cyborg Jason, an armored plated Jason, which was the funniest part of the film, I mean the guy is really indestructible (not that he wasn't in the past) But the fact that he's become a bullet proof cyborg, adds a lot more comic relief to the film in my opinion. Jason X is a silly ride and is a film that asks the question, have the film makers finally run out of good ideas? My answer? Yes they have, they should've skipped and made Freddy Vs Jason instead of the film.",

Jason X does return to the formula of the films that we haven't seen since A New Blood, where it's basically Jason on a murder spree in ONE singular area (Part 8 was scattered and Jason Goes To Hell was you know what), except placing him a a resurrected mad man in a semi-apocalyptic 2455 after having been frozen for over 400 years. It's bad, but unless you're taking this film seriously, it can be guilty fun. The idea is so absurd that you can't help but watch it, and to be fair, the kills in this movie are kind of cool, with the passing of time making MPAA more favorable to censoring, hence Jason X has a good deal of violence. The plot like any others is full of stupidity, dim-witted characters and tactics, and unlikely circumstances, but it's a movie that you're better off giving up on cohesion with and just simply kicking back for a good laugh.",

The reasons were many.  I thought the series would have ended just fine after \"Jason Takes Manhattan.\"  I hated the fact that Sean Cunningham came along after many years of disassociating himself with the series that I grew up loving and, in essence, trashing it.  And I HATED the self-referential/jokey tone that the New Line entries had.  In essence, I really, really detested this period in \"Friday the 13th\" lore.\n\nEventually, I DID write a review of \"Jason Goes to Hell\" on an online forum, but unless you're one of the loyal posters at the official wrestlecrap forums, you'd never seen me review \"JGTH\" before...but this one escaped me.  Until now.  Yes, folks, this is the first time that your humble host has ever written a review of \"Jason X,\" so now that I've officially raised the expectations pretty high for this momentous occasion, prepare to be disappointed.\n\nDespite this flick's status as the FIRST \"Friday the 13th\" film we got in nearly a ten-year period, for some reason, it's always been just kind of there for me.  This has got to be some kind of major accomplishment - the movie is about friggin' JASON VOORHEES TROMPING AROUND IN A SPACE STATION, for Christ's sakes.  It's not supposed to be dull and monotonous, but nonetheless, that's what we get with this movie.  The characters, with one notable exception, are entirely forgettable, and the writing is fairly moronic.  Okay, maybe not fairly - it's fully, 100% moronic.  Still, for all intents and purposes, I didn't hate \"Jason X,\" and with my third viewing of the movie coming just yesterday in anticipation of this review (I hope you're happy, loyal cavalcade of three fans), it's got a few things going for it that I'll get to in a bit.\n\nThe lone Horror Nerd interesting fact about the production of this movie - believe it or not, Sean Cunningham decided to produce this film because \"Freddy vs. Jason\" had been in development hell for so long that he thought another \"Friday\" film would be fun to do.  Color me impressed, Mr. \"Get this guy the hell out of the hockey mask.\"\n\nOkay, the story.  I don't know, do you really need a story?  Isn't \"Jason in Space\" really all the story you need?  You want more?  Okay.  It's the year 2008, and Jason Voorhees (once again played by Kane Hodder, and once again we get to witness the hulking stuntman/character actor absolutely nail the silent role) has been captured by the U.S. government.  It seems that scientists want to study his strange regenerative powers.  Of course, horrific accidents occur wherein our hockey-masked hero (it feels really good to type those two words after the review of \"JGTH,\" it really does) causes all sorts of havoc, and eventually wounds up cryogenically frozen with one of researchers.\n\nFlash forward to 2455.  Humanity has taken to the stars, or something.  Actually, it is explained - the real Earth has become polluted to the point that human beings can't survive there anymore.  Happy, plot completists?  Anyway, a group of students find the research facility, unthaw Jason, and bring him aboard their ship.  Of this group of characters, the only one even worth mentioning is Kay-Em 14, a shapely robot chick the researchers have with them as an assistant.  She's the only one you'll remember by name at the conclusion of the film; the rest of the cast is murder fodder.\n\nAt that level, though, this film is infinitely better than \"Jason Goes to Hell.\"  Two main improvements that the creators of the series made from the previous installment:\n\n(1) Much more screen time for Kane Hodder.  Forgive me for beating the dead horse, but the man IS Jason, and his presence and malice - sorely missed for 13 years - is back in full-form this go 'round.\n\n(2) Awesome kills.  Two in particular really stand out in this flick - the \"frozen face smash\" and the \"back breaker\" deaths.  The former is easily the most memorable kill since the immortal \"sleeping bag of death\" kill from \"Friday the 13th Part VII.\"  So huzzah to writer Todd Farmer for that.\n\nOh, and then there's the \"Virtual Camp Crystal Lake\" sequence, damn near worth the price of admission alone.  While some critics point to the scene as too tongue-in-cheek, I chuckle every time I see it.  The material that we're parodying here isn't Shakespeare, after all; it's a silly slasher series.  A lot of fans (myself included) got a kick out of the familiarity of the scene, and it was quite the interesting little sidebar.\n\nUnfortunately, there really isn't a whole lot else to say about \"Jason X.\"  It's Jason in Space.  It's campy, somewhat fun, a little ridiculous, but overall a pretty forgettable little film with plenty of completely disposable characters whose names you can't even remember 24 hours after watching it.  It's definitely not the worst movie in the series, but nowhere near almost ALL of the Paramount films, and it's easy to see how this flew in and out of theaters as quickly as it did.  In short, it's just as mediocre as this review.",

I was hoping to do a blu-ray review, but i haven't been able to find this yet in hi-def or blu-ray. Anyways, Jason is frozen in cryo-freeze and thawed out in the year 2455 only to wreak the normal kind of terror on a group of science students aboard a research vessel called the Grendel. The movie moves pretty fast paced, but it lacks any real depth or story. Basically a new effort to boldly take Jason to the next frontier, which in this case is outer space. I guess i can't act so surprised, i mean he has taken New York, been to hell, fought Freddy, had a remake, what else is left? I got it: Jason Goes to Candyland! Or even better Jason Takes Narnia! 4-starz for true greatness.",

Yes, that part was vital to the story.\r\nAnd then there's stuff like holograohic teenage girls wanting to have a beer, smoke some pot, and then have sex with Jason. And as if that weren't stupid enough, then he picks them up in their sleeping bags and starts hitting them against each other and against trees. That was one of the funniest things I've seen in a while, but it looke like it would've made more sense in an Erin Freedberg and Jeff Seltzer movie. With the pace this one set, it seems like they should've made an twelth one called \"Jason on the set of Disaster Movie.\" I bet that it would've been better than this. \r\nHow do they even manage to market this as a horror movie? It wasn't suspensful, it was barely gory at all, and the effects were so corny it was ridiculous! Half of the views of the spaceship from outside looked like a LEGO set!\r\n\r\nThis isn't really a movie that you hate watching; it's more one that you watch with friends for a laugh.

He even made robotic noises when he moved! Cheesiest, most far-reaching plot EVER. But in the realm of horror movies, plot can sometimes become secondary if the movie has some kill scenes that make you laugh, squirm, or want to vomit. In Jason X's case, the body count and inventive deaths are worth the hour and a half of cheesy characters, sub-par acting, and super terrible plot. \r\n\r\nThis is a movie where you enjoy rooting for the bad guy because you WANT to see some of these annoying characters die. This movie is not to be taken seriously on any level.  He puts a chick's face into dry ice then slams it into a table, shattering it into a pile of ice and mush. He throws a guy onto a giant spiky screw, then watches as the guy's body twists down the screw, twirling up his insides. He pulls the side of a spaceship off (as Uber Jason) and causes a girl to get sucked through a grate. That sounds like entertainment to me!",

Disaster is what this film is from the beginging all the way to the end. \r\n\r\nThe film starts of with a sort of \"Alien\" sequence in a secluded area in which Jason is tied and placed in cryopreservation. Frozen but like all sci fi thrillers, something always happen. Always a disaster or a mistake which concludes to some hyper sleep which ends up 400 years later. Seem more confusing then ever but what ends up more confusing is that despite the immense technology, Jason is never really killed and common sense has never participated in this film. Jason was to cunning that he knew where people were and knew when to attack, almost hitting the right notes to further distress our victims. With no pro thinking whatsoever from any point of view. He just kills a dozen of horny students, a money hungry teacher, and prideful grunts. Where msot of them scream and some fight back. Interesting but badly executed. \r\n\r\nThere is no lake and no camp. Just a spaceship. Wether this is a direct sequel or a spinoff is not of question but wether if Jason can ever die or will someone just blow him up to pieces. That thought was never put to mind as people were to worried with details and compromising deaths. Like fire sqaud, electric chair, and poisoning. Actually, the whole cast was written to simply blast him apart with high power futuristic guns. But never once tried to blow him up. Common sense is not respected. Nothing is respected. Just cold blooded killing and a fierce Jason whos bent on killing just anyone because mommy died. \r\n\r\nThere is no retrospect of his life other then what I have already told you. This film holds no bold statement and relies to much on man slaughter. Sex and greed plays a huge part but the story is to dull and the characters to forgettable. Its not creative and it doesnt capture fire. All it does is relinquish old cliches by making them even more annoying. Or to modify it to a degree of great travesty. Even the steel armor and the slick machete is never respected because everything was so bad. We were simply at lost at this imagination of a horror. It greets and beats like every other Jason film. It doesnt hold and doesnt excite the faithful fans. It just makes them more impatient. \r\n\r\nJason X is the perfect example of how to turn a great horror phenom into something foolish and pathetic. Not even the nice crystal lake sequence in the end can do enough to get the monkey of the back, ironically.",

If you haven't seen the movie, my review contains mild spoilers.\r\n\r\nI thought Jason X was okay, as in it wasn't a masterpiece. I drifted into the suspense of the movie, but it didn't leave a long lasting impression on me. To add on that, there was only a few characters which were developed into, the plot was pretty bad, some of the dialogue was cheesy, and the concept is just atrocious. Jason Voohrees being in the future has to be one of the stupidest ideas I have ever heard. It just proves that they didn't have a good idea of what to do after nine sequels.\r\n\r\nSome of the positive additions were the badass deaths, which included having your frozen face smashed on-top of a counter, and slowly descending down a suspended drill bit. The music was good, but it isn't anything noteworthy or amazing.\r\n\r\nGoing into more in-depth with the characters: Lowe was the greedy guy, Kay-Em was an android created by Tsunaron (and conveniently they're lovers), and Brodski was the fearless fighter; Everyone else was average, or boring. The story takes place in the distant future when Earth has become too polluted to live on, so human kind lives on a new planet called Earth 2. After a field trip, a crew discovers Jason and they bring him on board their space ship, only to be running from him until the end of the movie. As for the dialogue, there's not much to say about it other then \"overused, and juiceless\".\r\n\r\nEven though Jason X is a slasher film, there's one particular moment that anyone will laugh at: the sleeping bag murder. During the final minutes of the movie, they trick Jason with a hologram of Crystal Lake, with two ladies asking Jason to either smoke drugs, drink some beer, or if he wants to have premarital sex with them. They even take their tops off, which is amusing to tell the truth, but this whole scene is unrealistic. But anyways, how does he kill them? Well he grabs one of girls in her sleeping bag and smashes the other, then once the first one's dead he flings the survivor into the tree. It may sound devastating in the review, but you have to see it for yourself. It's fucking hilarious.\r\n\r\nOverall, should you watch this movie? Unless if you're a fan of the Friday the 13th franchise, then probably not. If you've never watched the previous movies, yet you know about Jason, then you won't be lost at the start of the movie. You did miss a lot of backstory, though.\r\n\r\nBy the way, even if you did watch the previous installments, the beginning has Jason captive by the goverment. In the ninth Jason movie, it has him being sent to hell; is Freddy vs. Jason the only way as to how he was captured, because in that he escapes hell. What the hell...",

While Jason X is far from a perfect it is still a decent watch it is the same formula just like the previous installments and since it's Jason in space there are more worse places to put him in and space is a lot than the whole Jason in the snow thing that they were planning on doing and yes I know the special effects but dated but come on it was 2002 and I've seen worse special effects in recent movies. As just a film overall Jason X is a decent entry in the franchise it has decent kills, average acting, decent screenplay, and decent special effects.",

Coupled with terrible special effects, there was only one thing keeping this movie from becoming utter trash; the storyline. But lo and behold, that sucked balls too, creating a terrible festering mass of failure and laughable attempts at storytelling. To be honest, I really couldn't tell if this was a comedic parody or a horror film. I'm still not 100% sure. \r\nThe background to the plot, however, is rather interesting; an apocalyptically desecrated Earth with humanity spread among the stars, with a research group returning to the inhospitable planet to study the ancient civilization that used to flourish there. This does not even begin to scratch the surface of redemption for this terrible movie however, as Jason continues with his murderous escapades for no explainable reason. \r\n\r\nCompletely terrible, don't waste money buying or renting it. It's not even worth the fraction of a calorie it takes to twist your eyes in their sockets to stare at the cover. \r\n\r\n1/10",

Some of the kills are really awesome though. They revisit the sleeping bag kill from part seven in this one and it's pretty entertaining. The real kill that steals the show is Adrienne's kill. When Jason first wakes up from cryogenic stasis, he takes Adrienne's face, shoves it into a sink filled with liquid nitrogen, pulls it out, and then smashes it on a nearby table. It's truly the highlight of the film. Jason is in space. That's pretty much the gist of the storyline. Uber-Jason is a joke. Other than looking different, he doesn't do much of anything the normal Jason wouldn't do.

The gigantic man of steel with a hockey mask it something you will recognize in your worst of nightmares . It has been years since the masked serial murderer has finished off an innocent being . Now in the movie it is the future, hundreds of years after being finished off for good . He has now been frozen since then, and typical of a B horror movie he somehow was unfrozen, and now will kill every one in his path . It's an incredibly cliche, and lifeless story plot, that has nothing good to be said about it . It's kill, after kill,  after kill and finally sex to round up the package . There is nothing interesting or exciting about the plot . It does have one, but it's so horrible and forgettable that it isn't even worth mentioning . It's the general horror movie trapping, and this movie show's it off in every way . It's not entertaining . It's mindless killing that seems to go nowhere, and will even bore the most hardcore horror movie fan to death . Of course the acting as awful, tasteless, and lets not even start with the dialogue which is downright horrible . If there is at least one thing that saves the movie from being amongst the league of the most horrible of movies released of it's year is the convincing matter of making you feel like Jason is in a futuristic world, giving the movie sort of an alien-ish vibe . \r\n\r\n\r\nOverall - Jason X is what you would expect from a modern B horror flick . It's awful, and redundant right down to the last minutes . It's great amongst it's class of B list horror movies, but that's not a compliment, it's an insult . It's not even a popcorn flick it's film you shouldn't watch . Even if your a fan of Friday the 13th avoid this movie at all cost .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- Jose A. Ramirez Moya",

After watching it with an open mind, this movie is actually pretty good. they use the science fiction aspect pretty well and it's not just there for kicks. the characters are still kind of bland but at least they have personality. the kill scenes are pretty cool and much better than in Jason takes Manhattan (especially the sleeping bag scene). some of the comedy is useless and not funny, but at least they're trying. a lot of scenes remind me of James Cameron's Aliens. the suspense is great, just when you think Jason is dead, he comes back for more. the ending was great and it gives you that good old Friday the 13th feeling, even though there was no direct sequel to follow (it would be kinda hard to keep the series fresh after this).

It's clever, it's witty, it's self knowing, and it's better than pretty much all of the other nine films combined. The killings are more creative and inventive, the script is laced with a streak of self-deprecation and sly irony and the film looks better, with some cool set work, costume design and effects. The best sequel of the series. Actually scratch that, Jason X is the best film of the series, period.",

The FX are okay and the characters are mostly unlikable and annoying aside from the retro leading lady and Kane Hodder of course. It's not a terrible movie I especially enjoyed the 80s sleeping bag scene but I do feel like it's the weakest of the series. The uber Jason design is cool but unnecessary and the fact that they're aware their making a bad movie is i believe its biggest problem.

            "content": "Jason X \r\nIt hass been a while since Jason has been seen in Jason Goes to Hell, but now his time is done and returns to earth to participate in a space program. Jason X is a bad, bad movie. It is better than New Blood or Jason Takes Manhattan in acting and spirit wise, but it surpasses stupidity than both of those films. The flick is clumsy beyond redeeming bounds or value. It is incompetent, inept, insipid, gloriously moronic, and a lot more. Did I mention it is incredibly stupid by a new record? The film suffers from the obvious bad writing, characters, plot, development, cinematography, suspense, and logic, but suffers with bad special effects and that takes a toll. The special effects have always meant something in Friday the 13th flicks as we gather up to see a new way of slashing, stabbing, dicing, and other deaths. However, here the CGI is fairly obvious that a preschooler can tell the obvious cheapness and have, for whomever, memories back to the 50\u00c3\u00a2(TM)s when two paper plates with strings were used for flying saucers. \r\n\r\n2010 \r\nThe film opens up in 2010 as Jason is held captive by a small military unit with commanding officers and team of scientist bent on using him despite scientist Rowan\u00c3\u00a2(TM)s objection. They visit to transport him, but are killed off when Jason breaks free. Rowan, the final girl, reacts quickly by defeating Jason in placing him in a capsule to be cryogenically frozen. Victory, apparently not, is cut or stabbed when Jason pierces Rowan from leaving out the door. The two are frozen. \r\n\r\n2455 \r\nThe frozen bodies are discovered after a group of students with an accompanying professor. They find Jason first, and we learned that hockey has been outlawed for some odd reason, goodbye dentist. Anyways, the students find Rowan and take both of them to a spaceship, but not before its accidents. Anyways, we go to the spaceship and learn it is filled with sex crazed students running around having fun. I can\u00c3\u00a2(TM)t remember if any of them were doing drugs, but that\u00c3\u00a2(TM)s not the point. Among unfreezing the two, the chaos begins. I was amazed that stupidity flourishes throughout the future. We begin with Professor Lowe as he is told by a financial adviser that human from the past is worth a lot of money. However, the killer Jason Voorhees is worth a lot more. I am guessing the financial backer has seen some of the Friday the 13th films. Wanting to profit, Lowe has Jason unfrozen despite Rowan\u00c3\u00a2(TM)s objection and once again, chaos ensues. I cannot remember who, but Jason wakes up as female scientist Adrienne has her back turned and echoes of sadomasochism. This scene is amusing as it is tasteless.  Anyways, Jason wakes up delivers the first and best kill since 445 years as he holds Adrienne's face in liquid nitrogen and smashing her face in bits. \r\n\r\nNow that Jason has been brought back to life and ready to slash, I am going to make ephemeral talking about what goes on next. The crew is unaware of Jason, so it allows us to relax and enjoy the insightful view of stupidity and death. Students and staff are picked off one by one as they commit all the errors that lead to death in a slasher film. There is an attempt of resistance as a number of folks with brief personalities battle Jason only to die. I guess they did not receive the memo of Jason\u00c3\u00a2(TM)s ability to regenerate loss skin tissue or damage. Anyways, folks are picked off one by one as they wander around in the dark yelling out names. It is no surprise. Anyways, we get the whole \u00c3\u00a2Ten Little Indians\u00c3\u00a2? concept as it boils down to the final girl, but I was surprised as the flick took a few positive turns. A handful of people make it out alive only to learn the spaceship is damaged and ready to blow up. There is an improvement around here when battle takes place between Jason Voorhees and a sexy android known as the KM-14. The battle scene is loaded with laughs and excitement that doesn\u00c3\u00a2(TM)t save the flick. The film looks like it\u00c3\u00a2(TM)s clear for ending, but another twist appears. This twist is ludicrous outstretching the flick until the ending secured, uneven. Jason has landed on Earth 2, kill-k-kill. \r\n\r\n2011/present \r\nI return to the first paragraphs the film\u00c3\u00a2(TM)s flaws as it is pervasive. I could go on with a large list enough to be a single roll of toilet paper, but that will be boring. The necessity to get intricate in criticism is not required because the intelligence and structure is frivolous. Its absurdity and sullen style can be spotted within the opening. However, a Jason flicks have always perverse itself with a dark sense of humor overtime, so I forgive it on that part. At this moment, I flurry into the film\u00c3\u00a2(TM)s positive. Its triumph relies in vulgarity and stupidity. They mesh together and polish the film near it\u00c3\u00a2(TM)s so bad it\u00c3\u00a2(TM)s good. There\u00c3\u00a2(TM)s a great cheap scene with the ship colliding with a station known as Solaris. Awfulness is pretty funny throughout including two gaudy scenes that\u00c3\u00a2(TM)s a new record in my book. I cannot describe it completely as I am tempted to tell you watch the film or spoil all. However, I can allow hints and winks when we see KM-14\u00c3\u00a2(TM)s envy during one scene and two sexy girls\u00c3\u00a2(TM) valiant resistance and mutual endeavor with Jason. Indeed, this fun and humorous if you are tolerant to this behavior. I could only have hoped for a brief romanticism in the flick. Aesthetic meets schlock in bowl of blood with limps floating. An attempt to bring a sort of innocence to the young adults in the spaceship as crew and staff bite their nails. Added correctly with writing, direction, and mood, the film would have made an adult feel like a kid. I admit I found myself in this position. It is sad, however, that I must return from fantasy to finish this flick. \r\n\r\nWe are left with a too long journey as the flick tries to be serious at times with eclectic elements from better flicks. The list is not long, but I thought the following: Alien (A), Blade Runner, Hellraiser: Bloodline (D-), and 2001: A Space Odyssey (A) just to name a few. I can\u00c3\u00a2(TM)t recall if I saw any Star Wars or Star Trek influences. Anyways, we get themes from the flick, and it is unable to transform itself. Better yet, there is no clear visual to what the film wants to be. Are we supposed to get a scary film gone wrong or is this was an attempt to make a campy and silly flick with optional variation. The weigh questions burdens down the ship. There\u00c3\u00a2(TM)s trouble with the engine! The cinematography ruins the picture as hinted the use of a cheap digital recording camera. The engine is burning! I was offended by the sight of bad CGI as I began to ponder the comparison between this and legendary Ed Wood films. Okay forget the fire, the engine is gone! I could forgive a bad film if it is pretty funny Texas Chainsaw Massacre- the Next Generation, but Jason X misses, ah!, the mark, squeal, for a recommendable, gah!, opinion, agh!. Yet, I cannot dismiss it, phew.  I enjoyed the documentary The Many Lives of Jason Voorhees and some other cool special features, but it is not enough for mainstream audience to watch. Jason fans will and the opinion will be mixed. \r\n\r\nOther notes: you know a movie is in trouble when fame critic like Roger Ebert uses the word \u00c3\u00a2suck\u00c3\u00a2? in a review. I understand why original director of Friday the 13th Sean Cunningham produced this flick, but he should have stayed patient or keenly aware of the film. The senescent Jason has shown no sign of retiring.\r\n\r\nGrade: (D+) film (C-) DVD\r\n\r\nFlick written by Todd Farmer and directed Jason Isaac.",

I am not a fan of horror films and don't usually watch them but once I read what this one was about I became curious...and curiosity killed the cat as they say...Lord have mercy on my soul! I can honestly say in my personal opinion that THIS is the scariest, most terrifying, horrifying movie I have seen in my life. Granted I have not see many horror movies but from the ones I have seen, this one takes top prize! Jason Voorhees returns with a new look, a new machete, and his same murderous attitude as he is awakened on a spaceship in the 25th century! I saw this film years ago in Hawaii at the theater and needless to say I went with a good friend.  We had to take turns sleeping at each other's apartments because we were big time scared!! I had a big headache once we got home...The writing team of Victor Miller and Todd Farmer was amazing. The director-James Isaac truly knows his craft in evoking fear and suspense! Even down to the soundtrack, sound effects, this man did an unbelievable job! Perhaps this is one of the few times where our villain (main protagonist) does not utter one word in the whole movie yet his  mere presence is enough to send chills down our spine (with that unforgettable sound)...In 2008, Jason Voorhees is captured by the U.S. government. Rowan (Lexa Doig), a government researcher, leads several unsuccessful attempts to execute him. In 2010, she decides to place him in cryogenic suspension to neutralize him. Unfortunately, the government has other plans, hoping to profit from research into Jason's rapid cellular regeneration. Jason escapes while being moved and kills seven soldiers. Rowan manages to lure him into the cryonic chamber and activates it. However, Jason manages to stab her through the door, both wounding her and freezing them both inside the sealed room.\r\n\r\nIn the year 2455, Earth has become too polluted to support life and humanity has moved to a new planet, Earth Two. Five students on a field trip led by Professor Lowe (Jonathan Potts) enter the facility and find Jason and Rowan. They take them back to their spacecraft and reanimate Rowan. Jason is deemed deceased and left in the morgue. During a call to his financial backer, Professor Lowe explains that he had hoped to exploit Rowan's status as the oldest person revived from cryostasus for profit, as he is in serious debt. The man dismisses this, but notes that Voorhees' body could be worth a substantial amount to a collector. In the morgue, the ice on Jason begins to thaw and he becomes reanimated..all hell breaks loose and as you can guess, Jason goes on a killing spree but this time, he is a cyborg with regenerative tissue. For pete's sakes Jason cannot seem to be put down for good! As you are aware a few days ago Friday 13th was released nationwide (still playing I think)- common Jason Voorhees must be 50 something years old by now- do us a favor Hollywood, KILL this character once and for all...he deserves it. For the rest, watch at ur own risk because the movie is intense, and terrifying. It should satisfy the hard core horror fans.",

            "content": "They say that the one where the character goes into outer space is the death kiss for a horror series (note: the Halloween series thankfully hasn't gone this route...yet), but this is surprisingly not the worst in the F13 series (it also didn't damage Pinhead too much). Not only is it much more fresh and fun than the preceding 3 entries, but it's also more tongue-in-cheek (and not in an annoying way either). I'd say that this goes back to what they started with Friday the 13th Part 6, and that's a good thing! \n\nIt's been awhile since I've seen this one, so my memory's a little fuzzy, but still I'd like to mention a few things that stick out. Firstly, though this film doesn't exactly set the bar for great horror filmmaking, this has one of the greatest onscreen deaths in film history. I won't say what it is, but you'll realize what it is when your mind is blown. \n\nThe major mistake the film makes is in \"updating\" Jason. His general look has always been unmistakably and irrationally creepy, but the new \"futuristic\" look just succeeds in making him look kind of lame. The scenes with him fighting the robot lady were entertaining, but definitely cheapened what was an already dying series. \n\nAll in all, a more fun entry than the preceding few, and not as moronic as the previous one (at least this actually has Jason instead of Jason's spirit inhabiting random guys' bodies!) but definitely feels like DTV material. I like it overall, but it sure didn't do much for the series' credibility. Thankfully I think the recent remake took a step in the right direction.",

            "content": "Jason X\ndirected by James Isaac\nwritten by Todd Farmer\nbased on characters created by Victor Miller\nstarring Kane Hodder, Lexa Doig, Chuck Campbell, Lisa Ryder, Peter Mensah, Melyssa Ade, Derwin Jordan, Jonathan Potts, Dov Tiefenbach, David Cronenberg\n\nWhat would a 455 year old cryogenically frozen serial killer go for in the mid 25th century?   Could he be put on display like an ancient artifact and paraded in front of the slavering masses for fun and profit?\n\nA government researcher named Rowan (Doig) has decided to cryogenically freeze Jason Voorhees (Hodder) after it has been determined that he cannot be executed due to his ability to regenerate.  The government, however, wants to make money off of Jason and make plans to further research in the direction of understanding the nature of regenerative process.   Naturally chaos ensues when Jason escapes and butchers numerous soldiers.  He is finally contained and frozen but not before he stabs a government researcher named Rowan and  pierces the chamber causing a leak which freezes her as well.  They are discovered in 2455 and Rowan is reanimated.  Jason is considered too far gone and left alone.  This proves to be a major miscalculation because Jason comes to life and begins the fine processes of thinning out the herd.\n\nThe first half of this film is actually entertaining.  With Jason roaming about picking off more soldiers one by one it has a particular rhythm that sustains it for a considerable length of time.  But then Jason disappears and it turns into a rather pedestrian story about a scared crew trying to get off of their space ship.  Once Jason disappears the story recedes and there just isn\u0092t anything worth getting worked up over.\n\nThe film features a whole lot of techno speak which obviously means something to somebody but if you don\u0092t speak the language you end up nodding your head a lot wishing Jason would burst through a door and slaughter whatever annoying tit is polluting the screen with his or her inane warblings.\n\nAgain, early on it feels that the sci-fi/spree killer matrix is going to work out just fine.  It\u0092s a fantastic concept: putting Jason on board with a group of faceless, nameless gits who make good fodder for a creature as gifted as our hero.  And as long as the killings continue, it appears that the film is successful.  Unfortunately they take the star out of the film and spend the next half whining and puling about how they are going to escape the heavily damaged vessel and make it out alive.  It\u0092s like \u0093Aliens\u0094 without the pulsating glamour of the beasts and it just doesn\u0092t mean much in the end.\n\nThe film looks like every other sci-fi catastrophe film ever made only a bit cheaper.  It\u0092s got the fancy computer networks, nifty devices, plus the ability to regenerate flesh, reattach limbs, etc.  People have all moved to Earth 2 because the first Earth is too polluted.  It\u0092s a chic snap at human kind\u0092s continuing use of their home planet as a garbage dump.\n\nAdmittedly, all of the females in this filmed are highly sexed up.  They wear skimpy little outfits that clearly make the film more watchable.  Without them, one would just fade into oblivion because none of the men are worth looking at.  They are all expendable and as always it\u0092s a grave pleasure to watch most of them get snuffed out.\n\nKay-Em 14 is one hot love-bot.  She has been created for reasons that are readily apparent to anyone who has seen her making out with her creator.  With Jason on the loose he gives her an upgrade and she suddenly showcases two enormous guns which manage to blow Jason to smithereens.   Sexy women (even robot women) with guns are always welcome and this film manages to deliver quite effectively on that front.   It\u0092s about the only truly fascinating part of the second half of the film.  Otherwise its just watching the crew members waiting and hoping that Jason cannot break through and slaughter them all.  He has his chances but is repeatedly rebuffed so a handful of them eventually do escape and Jason is cast out into oblivion.  \n\nOverall, this film manages to entertain for roughly ninety minutes before being transformed into a by-the-numbers sci-fi thriller.   Jason remains the only truly viable character and his mad killing spree is the highlight of the film.  He\u0092s a force of pure animal magnetism because he always seems to attract those who are just crying out to be butchered where they stand.  There are some regrettable kills in this film.  I was quite enjoying watching Adrienne (Angus) pretending to do some scientific work.  Like always, Jason always kills the most sexually alluring female first.  He simply cannot stand female sexuality and must destroy it whenever he encounters it.",

Maybe because my expectations were so low going in, I couldn't help but have a blast watching this flick.  It was campy and highly entertaining.  Unlike 'Jason Takes Manhattan', the change of scenery works because the filmmakers embrace the fact that this is 'Part 10' of a horror franchise.  There aren't going to be any good scares here, just some great kills and cheesy humor.  Jason in the VR room was simply classic.  If you have been with the franchise since the beginning, you can't help but just sit back and grin at how far out this series has gone.",

In order to even remotely pull a film like this off you need to have a decent sized budget. Jason X doesn't, in fact it looks like it was made for a fiver.\n\nThe plot is silly and again seems to disregard every film that came before. The year is 2010 and Jason has been captured and is being held at Camp Crystal Lake research facility! Supposedly he has the power to regenerate tissue so is impossible to kill. He is about to be frozen o be manages to escape and kill some soldiers before eventually being put into the chamber and frozen, taking his doctor with him. Flash forward 400 years, Jason is found by a bunch of space junk hunters and brought aboard their spaceship. Needless to say he thaws out and begins another killing spree.\n\nThis idea could have worked if they had a decent budget, setting the story in the future gives the film makers plenty of interesting ways for Jason to kill his victims. Sadly we get one decent kill and then the usual slice and dice. The zero budget means that the sets are terrible, the acting non-existent, the special effects cartoonish, the worst score I have ever heard and simply awful dialogue. Everything about the film is cheap and it's downright boring. It's no longer a horror, it's an action sci-fi with obvious references to aliens. You have to laugh that a film this bad tries to emulate such a classic film. Don't get me started on \"robot\" Jason, it looks terrible and the series died as soon as he came on screen.\n\nSilly silly film, awful production values and downright boring.\n3/10",

A slasher film set in space sounds awesome. While we technically already got that with 1979's \"Alien\" this movie had the advantage of having a legendary horror villain to use that could have set it to greatness. However the results aren't as satisfying.\r In it's best moments it can seem like a low-budget version of Alien. In it's worst the intentionally self-aware sense of humor cranks up the absurdity dial and pulls you out of the experience. Not that it was that great of a movie anyway. As always with this series the scares are non-existent and the appeal is just on watching characters get killed in brutally amusing ways while maybe getting to see some boobs in the process. It's mindless, but entertaining.\r You think that the jokes would actually end up adding some value to the experience, but they actually just end up bringing it down. Self-aware doesn't always equal funny. Sometimes the jokes can just be cringe worthy. However the only times things get bad is during an intentionally goofy showdown between Jason and a one-liner spouting android. That whole scene is just awful.\r I think the film would actually have benefited if it had taken the serious tone of the earlier Friday the 13th films. The idea would still be out there, but at least we would have avoided the bad jokes. As it stand though there is some entertainment to be had here. It can be quite fun and it's pretty cool to see Jason cutting down space marines. Your enjoyment depends on whether or not you can get behind the premise, as well as how big a fan you are of this series.

People who hate this movie seemed to be from a viewpoint that it was intended to be a masterpiece in the F13th Franchise. However I view it as a self aware title that is amazing. The kills are out right ridiculous and allow Jason to do things that we haven't really seen before as an audience. Of course there are stupid things like \"I think he's mad give him back his machete\" but to me it is the studio being aware that counselors commit stupid troupes. How many times do we see the counselors about to get frisky and *bang!* Jason is there to stop that sh*t like he was a Catholic mother. If anyone has seen Jason goes to hell they will know how stupid and ridiculous this movie series can get. How we got from a sack-head killer taking revenge on his experiences at the camp following his dead mother, to a black cannibalistic cop will forever be a mystery to me. That being said I believe they all bring entertainment value.\r The overall costume design is not bad but more of a silly thing where they re-shine his mask and add a cyborg element to him for some unknown reason other to say \"Hey we're in the future guys isn't that cool?\"\r The movie has some smart ideas in it as well not that many but some need to be recognized. One of which is a hologram of camp Crystal Lake used to try and confuse Jason, (After all the man is well over the average life expectancy and has literally been dragged to hell, drowned at the bottom of a lake, had a boat telepathically dropped on him, stabbed numerous times,and hung) so for him to be tricked shouldn't be that unbelievable. The film also uses it's environment in a way that makes sense. Air locks can be a blessing and a curse and you feel like the poster should say \"In space no one can hear you scream\".\r So in summary its one of those movies that you can laugh and scream at (whether that was the intended reaction or not) alone or with friends. Be open minded and maybe, just maybe you will have a very pleasant movie experience. Thanks for making it to the end of this and this is Reactions signing off.",

The film is popular enough to'Friday the 13th' may have been panned by critics when first released but since then it is one of the most famous and influential horror films, the franchise containing one of horror's most iconic villains. The film is popular enough to become a franchise and spawn several sequels of varying quality and generally inferior to the one that started it all off.Due to the location and incorporating space and sci-fi, on top of all the expected 'Friday the 13th' elements then some, 'Jason X' is certainly different and a little credit is due for that. For a 'Friday the 13th' film it and 'Jason Takes Manhattan' are pretty unique as far as the series goes. 'Jason X' is an example of different not really being a good thing.Interesting idea and understand totally what the film was trying to do, but it was messily executed. The strengths and faults are pretty much the same as with the previous entry 'Jason Goes to Hell', excepting 'Jason X' is marginally better because it tried to be different.A couple of creative and disturbing deaths and some inventive and stylish camera work lift 'Jason X' to a better level.One good performance too, which comes from Kane Hodder. Again creeping and chilling the socks off the viewer as Jason.However, those are the only praises really that can be given. The music is a little appealing on the ears, but it still doesn't have the eeriness and mystery that the pre-'Jason Goes to Hell' films had so brilliantly and doesn't fit as adeptly.That is the least bad though of the drawbacks, which are pretty much the same as those of the worst 'Friday the 13th' films but even worse than before. Again, like 'Jason Goes to Hell', while a good deal of 'Friday the 13th' films are silly, the silliness here is overkill that it becomes insultingly ridiculous. 'Jason X' is one of the most unique conceptually of the series, but it sure is one of the strangest to the point of overdone weirdness.'Jason X' tonally feels muddled and like it was trying to do too much with too many elements screaming of kitchen-sink. If it tried to do less it would perhaps have been a better film. Hodder aside, the acting is really horrendously amateur hour, even for the 'Friday the 13th' films where acting rarely was a strength.Likewise with the dialogue, which is even worse than 'Jason Goes to Hell', with 'Friday the 13th' at its most taking-simplicity-to-extremes, stilted, cheesiest and lacking in taste. Scariness and suspense is nil, instead going for witless comedy and gratuitous gore and nudity. The deaths go for quantity rather than quality, and generally are not particularly imaginative or creepy. The story is paper thin and confused, with too hectically paced storytelling and there is the sense that the series has gotten really stale even with a change in location.Overall, lame. 3/10 Bethany Cox",

But besides some clever homages and one cool ass death scene with liquid nitrogen it all plays out like an overly mediocre episode of andromeda which makes sense because so many people from the show are responsible for this. The plot is unimportant but basically Jason is frozen and than thawed out in the future aboard a space ship where he wreaks havoc. The FX are okay and the characters are mostly unlikable and annoying aside from the retro leading lady and Kane Hodder of course. It's not a terrible movie I especially enjoyed the 80s sleeping bag scene but I do feel like it's the weakest of the series. The uber Jason design is cool but unnecessary and the fact that they're aware their making a bad movie is i believe its biggest problem. Because instead of avoiding those pitfalls it becomes what it's making fun of.2.5/5",

We get everything 2001-ish except for that stupid sci-fi mumbo jumbo **** with the lab technicians (or whatever) dressed up like strippers and looking like ultimate sluts, that makes no sense at all. You can heal a 400 year old fossil but not someone who died just now? May be the movie explains it, and I might have snoozed at the very moment. But who the f**k cares? This movie is already nonsensical. There are some stupid references of the movie being in 2455 or whatever, and has some high tech weapons made of plastic to take out Jason. And, all the other negatives are exactly those of Part 8, in fact this is part 8, but in space - no good characters, no storyline, no logic, takes itself too seriously and absolutely sucks. This feels like a crossover between Power Rangers and the Doom Game, with Jason. It feels dragged as **** and is also a pseudo pornography. If someone says he/she hates sci-fi, he/she might have watched this movie. None of the characters are interesting. It sucks out all the life you have and makes you die of dehydration. I am really tired of watching this garbage, and I don't want to whine about this anymore. ..Conclusion : It was perhaps the worst idea, assuming that there were ideas that were introduced for this movie, for this movie.

Normally I would say yes, but I think Jason jumped the shark when he went to hell. But that could just be me. Jason X is the final movie before the remake and when he faces off against Freddy.PLOTCurrent year, they finally capture Jason but don\u2019t know how to contain him. He\u2019s cryogenically frozen along with a young woman. Over 400 years later a scientist and his students find the bodies and take them aboard their ship. Both wake up and Jason goes on another rampage. This is when Jason becomes Uber Jason.MY THOUGHTSOh, this sucks on so many levels!\u2013JaneesaWhile Jason kills 28 people, they are not overly graphic or too interesting in my opinion. I did like Adrienne\u2019s (Kristi Angus) death by her head being dunk into liquid nitrogen and being smashed to pieces. Great death. And Janeesa\u2019s (Melyssa Ade) death, being sucked through the grate (even though you only see the after effect), was more chilling than graphic. Being pulled through the gate like that is horrible. I think one of the flaws with this movie is the deaths and gore are all CGI and I\u2019m more of a practical effects kind of girl.It\u2019s sad to see this is Kane Hodder\u2019s last time playing Jason in a Friday the 13th movie. They hired other actors for Freddy vs Jason and Friday the 13th 2009. Brodksy (Peter Mensah), is the only other male, besides Tommy, who kills Jason. I did like Rowan (Lexa Doig) as the final girl. She wasn\u2019t weak and she did try to talk sense to people, even though they didn\u2019t listen. I did actually like a few of the characters. So it was sad to see some of them die.I like UberJason. I like the combination human(?) and cybernetics. Imagine going up against this? But, unfortunately, most of the kills are before he gets upgraded. I also liked the VR/Simulation of 80\u2019s campground with the two dumb girls. The sleeping bag scene was a nice throwback. That was funny. Nice to know you can distract Jason for a short time with this. LOLI like the sleekness of this movie but it lacked substance. I think this movie would have been so much better with practical effects instead of digital effects. Overall it\u2019s better than Leprechaun in Space but it is definitely in the bottom few movies of the series. Unfortunately, it\u2019s basically the end of the franchise. All we have left is Freddy vs Jason and the remake.The film was a critical and financial failure in its initial release in theaters, it made more than triple the cost of production in DVD and post-theater sales. Statistically, It is one of the most successful \u2018Friday the 13th\u2019 films.The film only had to make a couple seconds of cuts/alterations to earn an \u201cR\u201d rating, making it the least censored entry in the series.The film is included on Roger Ebert\u2019s \u201cMost Hated\u201d list.Features considerably less nudity than the previous Friday the 13th/Jason movies.If you want to see my other Friday the 13th reviews, click here: Friday the 13th Franchise.Let\u2019s get into the rankings:Kills/Blood/Gore: 2.5/5Sex/Nudity: 1/5Scare factor: 2/5Enjoyment factor: 3/5My Rank: 2.12/5IMDB: 4.4/10Rotten Tomatoes: critics: 1.9/10 audience: 2.5/10Letterboxd: 2.2/5",
