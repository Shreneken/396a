            "content": "Since nobody had the wherewithal or wisdom to re-release `2001' in the actual year 2001, a remake of Andrei Tarkovsky's comparable `Solaris' in 2002 would seem the next best thing.  Like those two earlier films, Steven Soderbergh's latest work is something of an `art' science fiction film, far more concerned with philosophy and theme than with action and suspense. This may make the film a tough slog for modern day audiences who have been conditioned to be jolted out of their seats every five minutes while watching films of this genre.  But for the deeper thinkers among us, `Solaris' offers a fairly intriguing sci-fi vision of the afterlife, a sort of new religious paradigm for the twenty-first century. \nGeorge Clooney stars as Chris Kelvin, a successful psychiatrist whose mentally ill wife - ironically enough, given his profession  - killed herself a few years back.  Chris is commissioned to travel to a space station orbiting the planet Solaris after strange things begin happening to the crew aboard the ship.  It turns out that dead loved ones have started appearing to the people there, leading a number of the crewmembers to descend into madness and, in the worst cases, even commit suicide.   It's not long before Chris' own dead wife, Rheya, arrives on the scene, prompting him to question whether she is real, a replica created for an unknown reason by the forces of the mysterious planet, or merely a figment of his own troubled conscience and imagination.  The film taps into that desire we all have of somehow being miraculously reunited with a deceased love one.  We can't help but be moved by Chris' intense desire to believe that all that is happening is real and that life with this person could indeed start back up where it left off.  Clooney does a beautiful job conveying the inner struggle between the grieving husband who wants to reconnect emotionally with this strangely familiar woman whom he had thought forever lost to him and the rationalistic scientist who suspects that both she and their relationship are illusory and ephemeral.  The film itself may be glacially paced, but the tension created by the situation pulls us through.  Natascha McElhone brings an ethereal beauty to the role of the dead wife, and we are moved by her own confusion as to whether she is really this woman Rheya or merely some fabrication usurping the memories and feelings of someone long gone from the scene.  Clooney and McElhone generate a strong romantic chemistry between them, both in the scenes aboard the ship and in the manifold flashbacks the storytellers use to reveal their relationship back on Earth.  Viola Davis gives an intense performance as Helen Gordon, the rationalist of the group who tries to convince Chris that he must overcome his feelings and destroy this facsimile of Rheya or risk bringing potential destruction to the people back home.`Solaris' has been shot in the widest screen ratio I have seen in years.  It almost feels like one of those old Cinerama pictures from the 1950's and 1960's, which is surprising actually, given the fact that, for all its outer space trappings, the film is really an intimate, personal drama in quality and scale (if you rent this on video, do NOT opt for the `full screen' treatment; rather, make sure it is in the letterboxed format).  Also, the set design and special effects are actually rather understated for a modern science fiction film \u0096 as is everything about `Solaris' in fact.  Like `2001,' `Solaris' is filled with images and concepts whose significance and meaning aren't always readily apparent or easily spelled out for the audience.   Just be forewarned that the film is more along the lines of a tone poem than a rip-roaring action adventure tale.`Solaris' isn't a great film and I can certainly see why many people, expecting something different, might find themselves becoming restive and bored by it.  For me, the film managed to seep under my skin and kept me interested most of the time.  This is definitely not everyone's cup of tea, but for those with patience and an appreciation for something a little different, `Solaris' has its share of rewards.",

            "review_title": "Powerful, thought-provoking metaphysical journey - A great remake.",
            "content": "My two favorite examples of Hollywood utterly destroying GREAT foreign films are Vanilla Sky and City of Angels, which were abominations of two of my favorite films - Open Your Eyes and Wings of Desire. If you've seen Tarkovsky's brilliant \"Solyaris\" this film will seem more like an Americanized tribute than a Hollywoodization of a great piece of Soviet cinema. Some will likely ask why Soderbergh bothered to make this film if he couldn't improve on the original. Personally, I could not care less. This is a great film, and shows that it is possible for Americans to remake classic non-American films sensitively, intelligently and well.To cut to the chase - if you like sci-fi with a soul,which stretches the boundaries of imagination, explores the uncharted realms of the human condition as much as the unknown realities of the universe, and swims upstream against the currents of ethics, physics, and even metaphysics, you will probably enjoy this moody, slow, multi-leveled and heavily textured film. If you're looking for light entertainment, stay away from this. This is a slow, intense film - dominated by dialog - and there is no action to speak of. Also, you need to let this movie pour into you slowly, so if you're not in the right frame of mind to pay attention and be receptive, you should save it for another occasion.The cast is exceptionally good. This is unequivocally the best performance I have seen out of George Clooney, but the supporting cast and the female lead all blew me away. Soderbergh does have a talent for making actor's look good, even mediocre actors, but there is nothing mediocre about any of the performances in this film.Though I recognize his talent, Soderberg's dialogical technique has worn particularly thin with me. The once fresh fast-paced, rapid-fire cuts and close-ups with the low-toned exchange of sentence fragments, and the myriad Soderberg imitators, particularly in television crime drama, have really gotten on my nerves. Solaris, however, is a bit different. There are only a few \"Soderbergh moments\" in this rich remake of the classic bit of 1970s soviet SciFi \"Solyaris\". Both films are based on a novella by the brilliant Stanislaw Lem. This film, perhaps even more than Tarkovsky's 1972 edgy, dark, and intense original, will appeal to exactly the sort of movie-goer that Lem's writing appeals to. Neither film captures Lem's quirky sense of humor. I am quite glad that Soderbergh chose to make Solaris with very much the same atmospheric eeriness, plot, and intellectual and emotional depth as the original. It is a tribute to his artistic integrity that he recognizes the brilliance of the original work, and imitates it wherever he can do no better, adding subtle and appropriate nuances and embellishments to make it his own. Some examples are the wonderfully minimalistic soundtrack, and the very Soderbergh symbolic use of lighting and color saturation to shift from the retrospective to the live-action shot. Perhaps the best tribute I can give this film is the fact that I am going to watch the original again in a few days for comparative purposes.In other words, this isn't going to be for everybody, nor, even, for most. I am hardly surprised by the very low (in my opinion) ratings received by this film here on IMDb. Solaris is a love story, a story of exploring the fringes of sanity, and of questioning the very nature of reality, and much more. Enjoy it!",

            "content": "First off, if you are looking for shoot 'em up, space ship flying through the stars, hunting aliens type of science fiction, don't even bother with this film. If you are looking for a Science Fiction film that explores the human condition in the way that Blade Runner, 2001: A Space Odyssey or Contact does, then this is right up your alley.This film is not about events and actions, it's about ideas and concepts. People looking for plot points to move them along will be bored to death with this film because most of the action of this film are those that will happen in your head. It is about people, desires, regrets and what we would be willing to do if we could have that one thing we cannot have back.Some people complain about the fact that Clooney's character of Chris does very little psychiatric work in this film. But, the truth of the matter is that his occupation is used more to propel his anti-faith views. I haven't seen it mentioned, but there is a reason why there are a lot of discussion about God, religion and faith in this film.Throughout the film, Chris questions and belittles Rheya's religious views, seeing the idea of putting stock in something that he sees as fantasy as being useless and just a crutch for people deluding themselves into a happiness based on illusion. Chris comes to realize that he would give up anything to be with Rheya, whether being with her is an illusion or not. His happiness depends on her, and he realizes that accepting what he needs is not a weakness -- as accepting faith is not a weakness -- it is simply a choice to fulfill one's life, whether it be real or illusion. And, as philosophers would argue, who can really say which is which?For those who want a science fiction film to make you think (like Blade Runner does), this film is it. With a tremendous cast, beautiful production design, excellent direction, and one of the best film scores in recent years (hats off to Cliff Martinez), I have no trouble recommending this film to anybody who is in the need of an intelligent, thought-provoking film.",

My reaction was neither.I am predisposed to like this kind of science fiction - the low key and wonderful \"Gattaca\" comes to mind. I found the story very intriguing and atmospheric and it held my interest - at the same time I felt something was missing and it just wasn't as rich, complex and good as it should have been.I am not sure why, I think the key for me is that I was not able to really get emotionally involved with the love story - and this is first and foremost a love story. I have trouble with most love stories, due to my own particular biases, so there has to be a lot there to really identify with it. I think the problem here was the casting and acting - it could have been a lot better. The woman playing Gordon was rather flat as well.Also the script was a little too obvious.All in all, an interesting film that I am glad I saw, but I can't really get worked up about it.",

He arrives to find Gibarian and most of the crew dead. Survivors Snow (Jeremy Davies) and Dr. Gordon (Viola Davis) are mercurial. Chris Kelvin starts having visions of his dead wife Rheya (Natascha McElhone).This is a great film but a terrible movie. You love car chases, big explosions, laugh tracks, or big emotional cues. DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM!!! YOU WILL HATE IT. Soderbergh said it right. \"If you hate the first 10 min, walk out right away. It's not going' get any better.\" The acting is terrific. Soderbergh uses all of his cinematic tricks in a minimalist vision. It opened my eyes to both GC and Soderbergh. In GC, I thought you had a popular guy who uses his charm to act his way thru most of his projects. In this, his range and acting ability is complete. Without a doubt, it is his best performance. In Soderbergh, I thought you had a good mechanical director who's able to produce hits. His best film \"Sex, Lies and Videotape\" was well behind him. In this film, he shows his experimental side and love of cinematic. There is no shot that was sub-par. This looks beautiful. The movie is able to move in some sections even without dialog.

            "content": "Solaris (2002)Some might find Solaris slow, or slick, or opaque, and I think it is all those things and for a good reason. Unlike Moon (2009), which is like a Tom Waits (and simplified) version of the same core theme, or 2001 (1968), which has something utterly impersonal to distinguish it, Solaris is a love story. And you are meant to float--or better, you are meant to be weightless--in the experience.The music (evocative dreamy music, by Cliff Martinez) alone makes clear we are in suspension. It's a trip, in the druggy sense and in spiritual sense. We have to figure out what these other beings really are (they look human, and some of them are) and we have to decide what it means to be alive (is it simply self-awareness?). We have to even decide whether the characters should live in the lie of some invented reality that feels utterly real, or to go for the old fashioned real thing and leave love behind.If it's love at all. After awhile you realize it's a kind a narcissism. And then you wonder why not? Whatever works, right?The movie is gently confusing. The lead is George Clooney. The whole movie is George Clooney. His love interest (undefined for here) is played by the big-eyed Natascha McElhone. If her staring eyes and gentle loving neediness seem a little overdone, it's for good reason. As you'll see (blame George). And the planet itself, exerting some kind of power over the consciousness of the humans on this floating (large) spaceship, represents something approaching God in its power and mystery. It's an atheist's movie, I'm sure, but filled with spiritual and human optimism.Most viewers don't know that this is a remake, and hard core film buffs dismiss this American Steven Soderbergh version as Hollywood at its worst (big budget, sentimental, pretty beyond reason). The earlier Soviet version (from 1972) is really interesting, too, and parts of it are even slower. On purpose. Other parts seem dated, to me, and if I think of the effects and the idea as ahead of its time, I remind myself that this earlier one is after, not before, Kubrick's Space Odyssey and so the whole progression is skewed. The Soviet version also seems more sexist, more male dominant, and whatever demeaning qualities exist in this more recent one, they seem more in balance, man to woman, at least in a less male gaze way.But academic analysis creeps in on a movie that is really much more about experiencing its mood, its tragedy and hope, and its delicate floating beauty, which I seem to enjoy without thinking too hard. There are moments, including the Michelangelo creation scene with the boy (yes!), that push it far too far (and seem Kubrick inspired, without Kubrick's icy sensibility). You might also be able to edit it differently to make it more compact. But these are debates to have once you've seen the movie. A warning: it's depressing to some people. To me, though, it's soothing. And the open ended qualities might make you want to see it again.",

            "content": "Story Something is wrong on the space station orbiting the mysterious planet Solaris, so Chris Kelvin (Clooney) goes there, all alone, to find out what's going on and to persuade the crew to come home. Turns out, when one is near Solaris, one tends to see dead people--or duplicates thereof. In Kelvin's case, this would be a doppelganger of his deceased wife, Rheya (McElhone), which seems to have Rheya's personality traits and memories.I had heard that Solaris was excruciatingly slow and, consequently, unbearably boring, but I didn't quite agree. I understood that many shots were included or extended to set the mood, and to illustrate thought and memory, and it was all visually interesting. I could see, for example, where Soderbergh showed his love for Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey with lingering shots of Clooney in an astronaut's helmet, patterns of light reflected on its glass. However I would have traded the extra hour of atmospherics for a deeper exploration of the intriguing questions the premise raised. When we say we love someone, are we saying we love the sum of the person's characteristics? Were we to lose our loved one, would a twin with the same likes, dislikes, and quirks be a suitable replacement? Would you want to live on in the memories of your friends and family or, as Woody Allen prefers, to live on in your apartment? This film seems less interested in delving into these mysteries than it is in portraying grief and subjective memory. Valid objectives, but Solaris left me wanting to see an episode of the similarly themed Caprica (of which I've only seen the pilot movie).Why you should see it You never got over that crush you developed on Clooney during his tenure on ER. You're in the mood for a visual poem of love and loss. You enjoy any movie set in outer space. You're the founder of Jeremy Davies/Dr. Faraday Fan Club.Why you should avoid it Star Trek: The Next Generation was set in outer space too. Pick an episode and it will lead you through a debate of life's big questions, in half the time.--from my review at www.1man365movies.com",

            "content": "The state of human minds has always been so abstract and never easy an easy subject to comprehend. It's even more complex to decipher on screen. Nope, this film is not strictly a ghost story, nor is it a Star Trek adventure story to interest most science-fiction craving fans. Don't expect to see the usual Hollywood sweet romantic tale either! This film focuses on the psychological journey faced by the despaired and unstable minds.  It's a film that totally relies on the characters' emotions and reactions. Awesome!Has Steven Soderbergh succeeded in sprucing up Andrei Tarkovski's 1972 psychological cult sci-fi classic to make it worth the while to pay a regular price of a tix?  Can't really say, as I've never seen the Russian version.  But I was truly mesmerized by this film's approach to what, I think, is the study of human insanity slipping beyond saving.The film is slow in pace and lengthy, with stretches of tedious silence, letting the imagination of the viewers try understand what happened to each of the characters seen, or heard.  Silence comes with such intensity that it works very proficiently in this film. There are dazzlingly and ecstatically artistic visual moments to offer that dreamlike stance. At other times, Soderbergh provides a more solid spectrum allowing the viewers to grasp intellectually the conflicts faced by the human minds - Kelvin, Snow and Gordon - as a result of some traumatically emotional events.  Viewers are told that Dr. Gibarian has already committed suicide. These may all be psychologists, but they all seem to exhibit signs of stress and paranoia. Oh yes, the psychological intent of the film's contents is truly complex and we are slowly led to see who will finally be capable of making the right choice, and escape insanity. Earth, presumably, is a symbol of normality!It's about the existential exploration of the minds' sufferings, almost as if the memories of the human mind are being driven to a test. It's reliving a past and letting memories play tricks on the minds. It's living on regrets, hoping they could rewind the clock backward to bring about changes to events that are gradually driving the victims to complete madness. Indeed, a very haunting!  Almost like the work of Bergman, Ophuls, Kubrick, and Welles, Soderbergh brings a well-crafted mysticism to the screen.... as if to to say that only one out of many entering a mental asylum can ever hoped to be cured. This film is very hypnotically effective and unique! Solaris - seemingly like an alien memory-stimulating anthropomorphic life form - is so eerily powerful on the screen.  It's the `mirror that reflects' what the mind is not willing to forget. It's the driving force to the human insanity.George Clooney is simply awesome. Follow his Kelvin as he deals with the issues of love, fear and death.  It deals with his choice to throw away every memory of his past or to cling to them. That's to say he has the choice to allow his memories to manipulate him, or throw them out altogether.  I find it hardly possible not to get totally absorbed with Clooney's character.  Scary as it may sound, ghostly memories are never easy to shake off and thus lead men to more deadly conditions. Sometimes for these beings, their choice of death becomes their ultimate solution of finding peace.  The performances of the ensemble of cast are solid, but the dialogue is the strength of the film, providing hints to what actually is happening to the characters.An intriguingly engaging film - that's my opinion, of course! The narrative progression is nicely eloquent and the ending is impressive - providing the viewers with the feeling of having unraveled the mystery and capture the relief.  It's certainly not a film for everybody... especially for those who dislike deciphering abstract ploys in films.  Readers of Jung and Freud may find this film interesting as it supports the theory that conflict arises within the mind, mental health and illness, dominance, creativity and hearing voices. Fan of Clooney may miss his usual extraordinary charm and wit, but I'd say, thumbs up to him for his courageous choice to engage the viewers with his talent in exhibiting his emotional expressions.\nA brilliant film!",

A true psychological drama may appear slow because the person watching has such a short attention span and a limited world view. There, I've said it, Mister 1 out of 10. I prefer the Russian version of this book by Stanislaw Lem, but this is a worthy interpretation. The planet Solaris has an affect on anyone that approaches it. It is a sentient organism and so it isn't there to be exploited; it's there to protect itself. When George Clooney's character is called to investigate the goings on at a space station that has been set up to investigate access to a water planet, he walks into a surreal mass of images and tricks. Something is causing personages to appear on board the space station. A child who should not be there runs down a hallway. People are committing suicide or running away, frightened or overwhelmed by emotions. Clooney, despite being a rock, still succumbs to the planet's trickery because of his great love for his lost wife. I often like to look to movies for an intellectual challenge.

            "content": "SOLARIS, directed by Steven Soderbergh, and starring George Clooney, is one of those pointless remakes Hollywood has been making these past decades that adds almost nothing to the original classic. The movie itself is good. Not great or even close to being bad or a misfire, just good.  Soderbergh basically boiled down the complex and epic story, as seen in the Russian film, into a simple MINIMALISTIC love story. Which made me wonder why did they even bother remaking the movie if all the science-fiction and metaphysical elements were thrown out? The story could have easily taken place entirely on earth. And instead of Solaris, the story could have been set in a mystical setting, like a haunted castle or an ancient archeological find. If you're going to set in space, might as well give the outer space aspect some sort of meaning to it. The minimalistic approach is interesting but the result is pointless. Having Rheya come back from the dead, sort of speaking, and her problems adjusting to her new reality reminded me a lot of the replicants' plight in BLADE RUNNER, which is what I think Soderbergh tried to do here. Who's reality is it?My only criticism about the movie is the use of dreams and flashbacks. In the film, the Solaris planet takes a person's main dream while they're sleeping (there's even silly close-up shots of Clooney's cranium). These dreams are seen as \"flashback\" in the movie. Dreams are rarely that linear. One doesn't dream about one specific thing or person (in this case Kelvin dreaming about Rheya) all the time. And dreams are impressions of reality. So when Rheya comes back, looking exactly like Kelvin's wife, for me this points out to an obvious weakness in the whole concept of the Solaris planet going into a person's mind and grabbing their version of reality. If this was the case, the reincarnated Rheya should have looked slightly different that the Rheya on earth. Oddly enough, the way Soderbergh approached the idea of a planet reincarnating a long lost loved one into flesh reminded me of the SPACE 1999 episode, A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH, more than the Tarkovsky movie. But I find that the SPACE 1999 episode, even with all its faults, was more epic and poignant than Soderbergh's version of the Stanislaw Lem's story. There's just something anal retentive about Soderbergh's direction which prevents any kind of emotions to seep to the surface.Unlike most people though, I wasn't bored at all with SOLARIS. In fact, movies like ARMAGEDDON, THE LOST WORLD: JURASSIC PARK 2 or THE CORE were a thousand times more boring than this  flick. It's just that the film's outcome is so predictable and that the script and filmmaker did nothing to alleviate this predictability that the pointlessness of the whole project comes to the fore. Good beginning. Predictable and flat ending.And then there's another odd point about Soderbergh's SOLARIS: where did the money go? The film reportedly cost $80 to $100 million to make. The cast is tiny (four or five actors). There are very few special effects and the sets look like your standard spaceship sets you see on a TV show like STAR TREK VOYAGER. Why spend that huge amount of money on a simple, predictable love story? The film should have cost $30 to $40 million, not $100.I love the Russian film a lot. But I can't say that Soderbergh create a disaster here or disservice to the Russian version or the book. It is a typically Soderbergh flick, which, on this aspect alone, sets it apart from the Russian movie. And like I've said, the film by itself is good. But in the end, it looks more like an episode of SPACE 1999 or THE TWILIGHT ZONE than a real movie.",

            "content": "As a science fiction film, Solaris follows the same rule as the best of the genre, namely that it isn't the creatures or technology that makes the viewers want to watch, it is the human drama. Which is just as well, because the film itself is slower than the proverbial wet week, in spite of being less than a hundred minutes in length. Nonetheless, I will be very interested to see future projects from Steven Soderbergh.The plot revolves around a psychologist who is suffering deep emotional problems, which mainly seem to revolve around the suicide of his wife. So when he is floating aimlessly around a spaceship that orbits the titular planet, apparitions of his wife begin appearing. From what I am able to discern, an alien intelligence is trying to take over the ship's crew, in the hope that the ship will return to Earth and take them with it. Of course, the crew have other ideas.In essence, it sounds a lot like the basic plot for Alien, minus the violence. Alien has a degree of violence, most of which is implied, and so too does Solaris. The difference here is that the violence is not essential to the plot. In fact, aside from a couple of corpses, you never really get to see any. Instead, we are given a good deal of exposition regarding the doctor's feelings regarding his wife and what he would do to have her back in any shape or form. When the Solaris alien appears in his cabin, it tells him everything he wants to hear, and appears exactly as he desires.The big question posed by the film is whether we are the sum of how we, and more importantly other people, remember us, or whether there's more that defines our reality. Having struggled with other people's wrong impressions of me for most of my life, I have often pondered this question myself. When the apparition-clone of Rheya is suddenly deciding that it would be best for her and Chris if she no longer existed in this form, she asks simply if she has simply been slapped together from Chris' memories or desires. Nobody ever knows all there is to know about another person, and that's what makes the surrealism of the story so compelling.I gave Solaris a seven out of ten.

            "content": "Arthur C. Clarke and Stanley Kubrick decided to make the 'proverbial good sci-fi movie' when they jointly created the film and novel 2001: A Space Odyssey. There have been few comparably good sci-fi films since. Solaris is, however, one of them.Whilst the Russian original is an epic and demanding film, Soderbergh's work should not be considered a remake. The director himself considers it his own interpretation of the book, quite apart from the earlier film. Because of this, the two should not be compared.If you hated Alien 3 because it didn't have any guns or 2001 because the ending was confusing, do not waste your time with Solaris. It is not for you.Conceptually, the story is standard psychological sci-fi fare, with simple but effective theological and philosophical themes. In this respect it breaks little or no new ground over the Tarkovsky predecessor. It has elements of romance, thriller, and drama, all necessarily set in sci-fi land, as the setting is integral to the storytelling.Visually, the Solaris future is a conservative, believable vision, reminiscent in look to that of Gatacca. Solaris space is a minimal, beautiful place to be. Not dirty and used like the celebrated Alien 'space trucker' look, Solaris vessels are gleaming, intricate and stylish, but seem to have been designed by engineers rather than artists, such is the practical realism. Their design is complemented by some of the best CG spaceship effects I have seen (incredible that it has taken this long for computer graphics to look as good as the model-based technology of 2001, Star Wars and Aliens in the 1960s and 70s).Solaris, the planet itself, is a clever piece of art, seemingly evidencing a degree of emotion by its colouring and detail, as no doubt was the intention. In the commentary to the DVD it is mentioned that many of the lingering shots of the planet were cut, which may have been necessary for the pacing of the film, but I found every shot an absorbing spectacle and would have enjoyed more.The sets and costumes also retain the sense of engineering realism combined with beauty. Soderbergh's eye for detail is evident here, as everything has a purpose and look that fits perfectly with the overall feel. Somehow, this look is original and avoids many of the clich\u00e9s we come to expect of sci-fi mise-en-scene.Channel Four recently showed this on UK television and billed it along the lines of a 'George Clooney Sci-Fi Romance'. A tenuous interpretation, perhaps, but you can see why they did it. Whilst Clooney adds Hollywood star appeal, fans will be slightly disappointed, not because his work here is in anyway weak, but because he is understated, convincing and very un-Hollywood. With Solaris he adds another fine performance to an already commendably diverse filmography.Natascha McElhone too plays a difficult, emotive role without resorting to melodrama. The small supporting cast doesn't put a foot wrong, with a delightfully odd but subtly creepy performance from Jeremy Davies worthy of note.Solaris is slow, abstract, haunting stuff. The direction is subtle, dare I say almost Kubrick-esquire. The camera work is non-intrusive, solid stuff without gimmick (apart from a touch of shaky-cam in the restaurant scene where Kelvin meets Rheya) or overstatement.Add to this a beautiful, timeless score by Cliff Martinez and you have one of the better psychological sci-fi movies ever made.The majority of people will hate Solaris. Let them. Let them have instead the mindless Hollywood trash released every week and keep this treasure for yourself.",

Folks, if your \"thing\" for sci-fi outer space genre' films is the usual suspect clich\u00e9' ad nauseum of invading creatures, violent chase scenes and exploding space ships, this is definitely not your film.Warning . . . warning . . . warning . . .This film requires and will induce thought.Concepts like define existence, what exactly is death, or life for that matter, is only the beginning edge of where this story takes you, as one follows George Clooney's character out into deep space aboard a corporate financed space station in orbit around Solaris.While living on Earth, he's summoned to go out to the station, to solve a \"problem\" that no one can understand or even describe . . .The minute he steps on board the craft, you know something's up . . . but in ways that go far outside the box of \"the usual suspect\" plot line.As for the characters and the actors who portray them, of course. I could watch George Clooney in just about anything, but the real star here is Natascha McElhone, as Rheya. The chemistry between these two is obvious, but Natascha has her own depth of character complexity that I cannot find words for here, but is absolutely compelling to watch.No, I'm not going to meander down a laundry list of what happens at various key pivot points in this story, as such would be tedious, and hopelessly inadequate to convey the experience this film delivers.From a technical and aesthetic perspective, this is a very beautiful, well crafted example of the artform. There is no wasted space as it were. Every scene is composed and integrated together to literally create an evolving artpiece containing a story, populated with living beings enmeshed into emotional complexities who may, or may not . . . be human, sort of . . .But that description can't even begin to hint at what is going on here in this unique story. For that, you'll just have see it for yourself.I humbly suggest investing the time to see this - you won't be disappointed",

It raised provocative psychological issues but never carried me away or led me to anything like an epiphany. In the latter half, I was in fact a bit bored. It certainly isn't enthralling like Tarkovsky's version. Rheya's character is better developed, particularly her own psychological trauma in being a \"creation\" (Tarkovsky's Rheya was something of a naif in comparison). But what I missed from Tarkovsky's version is the sense of humor (this one is stiflingly earnest) and the evocative and poignant use of Bach chorales in the soundtrack. The soundtrack to this one is intriguing (a la Brian Eno, Ligeti, and Thomas Newman's scores for The Player and American Beauty), but I eventually found myself desperately longing for a cadence. Lacking the feeling of redemption communicated musically in Tarkovsky's version, this one had to rely on ham-handed statements of fact. And finally, I can't help remarking that neither Tarkovsky nor Soderbergh really convey the element of shame and sexual deviance that played such an important part in Lem's original. Both place the emphasis instead on guilt, which isn't quite the same thing, is it?",

One of his closest friends, Gibarian, who introduced Chris to his now-deceased wife, Rheya (Natascha McElhone), is presently on distant Solaris. A group of scientists are studying the planet to see if there are minerals or other elements that would be valuable on earth. Since his wife has not been dead very long, Chris has been living in a semi-funk. But, by teleview, Gibarian suddenly asks the doc to voyage to Solaris, for there are strange happenings afoot. Having no other choice but to try to help his friend, Chris makes the journey. But, when he lands, tragedy hits him in the face. Gibarian is in a bodybag and there are only two living members of the team on the space station in orbit. Snow, a technician, tells Chris that some members committed suicide, like Gibarian, others died and one vanished altogether. The planet itself has been giving off bizarre signals and may be responsible. The other survivor, Dr. Gordon (Viola Davis) locks herself in her room and is paranoid to the point of hostility. Chris settles down for the night, where he dreams of his wife. He recalls meeting her, marrying her, and finding her dead, a result of suicide, too. Suddenly awake, Chris is startled to see Rheya at his bedside. How is this possible? She doesn't know and Chris is so frightened, he sends her off to die in space, thinking she's some kind of alien being in disguise. Snow and Gordon are not surprised to hear his tale and relate other beings, including Gibarian's son, who have shown up. But, as Gordon tells it, these creatures are \"copies\" of the original humans, made by Solaris, from the memories of folks such as Chris. What a concept! Unbelievably, Rheya shows up again, in a new body, and this time Chris wants her to stay. But, Gordon insists nouveau-Rheya cannot return to earth and the remaining team members need to leave as soon as possible, for she, Gordon, has developed a \"ray gun\" that will get rid of the replicants forever. She will take them down, one by one, and then they will leave, for the space station is getting pulled closer and closer into the Solaris surface by gravity. What will result? This amazing, beautiful, tantalizing film is a triumph for Stephen Soderbergh and all of the actors. Based on a Polish novel and a classic Russian film, its story is a labyrinth that has to be seen more than once to truly appreciate. The photography is sensational and so is the very moving score. Clooney, McElhone, Davis, and Davies are all nearly perfect as the humans trapped in the space station. Add on great costumes, sets, and direction and you have a film worthy of robust praise. Yes, its somewhat slow in nature but its the best tempo for a film that needs reflection and discovery at every turn.

But all he did was take 15-20 minutes of useful story, and stretched it into a 90 minute movie by adding on 70 minutes of useless garbage. Also, it seems as though he ignored the enigma of the living planet Solaris.Where the whole story could have been made on an episode of the Outer Limits, only a part of the story was used into making a major snooze fest.",

            "content": "The first time I saw Solaris, I was turned off by it. Maybe it wasn't the right time or I wasn't in the right mood, but it just felt cold, distant, like it couldn't connect, and that Clooney's performance was stoic but that he didn't do much except pose with wide eyes at his dead wife re-incarnated on a space ship. But life changes, times change, and my appreciation of film has grown in eight years (and also emotionally maturing from late teens to twenties does some difference as well). The film works now like a poem for loss and love, as opposed to a stilted science fiction story. It also rings with resonance since it feels like Soderbergh, as director/writer/DP/editor, has gone through similar or just exact emotions as characters in this film, or at least his surrogate in Clooney. He's gone through love and loss, and time, much like his main character (and like for many of us with memory), becomes splintered. The backdrop is fantastic, but is just right for what is emphasized in the story.It's also a gorgeously shot film, I should add. While it probably might not trump its predecessor of the material, Tarkovsky's 1972 film, it comes close, closer than would be expected. Again, what seemed like a cold style seeing it years ago changes with coming to it with a better appreciation of the technique that's employed here. It's significant that primarily the scenes inside the spaceship are all locked-down, only pans and tilting with the camera, and the scenes back on Earth- the memories of Clooney and McElhone's characters on Earth when they were married- are hand-held in camera, frenetic, more emotionally harrowing in the realistic breakdown of a marriage over time. Soderbergh's emphasis is direct, and he wants us to feel it as well, especially when the characters' minds break off into those memories, and as a time-line becomes one.The acting is also a great measure of Soderbergh's trust in the material. It's deeply emotional work, usually in the way that character do or try to hold back what is really going on, but when it comes over a character it's harrowing. I loved the moment when, for example, the 2nd version of Rheya is resurrected after she tries to kill herself with liquid oxygen on the ship. This should be nothing new to aficionados of science fiction (and indeed it was also a key scene in the original Tarkovsky film, done equally with passion and terror), but its handled solemnly, like this itself is sort of a tragedy, knowing how real-but-fake this Rheya is, especially when she becomes aware when waking up (watch her eyes in that moment, it's really extraordinary). Other supporting work from Jeremy Davies as a slightly crazy but intellectual comic-relief comes in (maybe the side of Soderbergh that's intelligent but erratic?), and Viola Davis as the real captain of the ship, trying to stick to reason.It's further impressive to see how Soderbergh, via James Cameron's fx company, utilizes the shots of space. There is wonder and awe, and certainly the music (co-opting off of 2001: A Space Odyssey, particularly the Jupiter Landing) works with them like attachments. But it's not used to overcome the viewer, just as a means of 'this is where they are'. What matters here are the characters; even if it is gorgeous and spectacular to look outside at the sights of space, what will happen to these people first? Soderbergh's film, one of his better ones really, focuses on the scope of human experience set in light and dark, reality and nightmare, like a poem suffused in what is haunting and bizarre. I hope to revisit it every so often. 9.5/10",

It featured a modern art gallery, full of well-dressed high-class people, walking around and commenting on various wacky paintings, until the camera pans over to several elderly men surrounding another example of art on another wall. They point at it, comment how surrealistic it is, how the author managed to capture this and that, how perfect and how brilliant it is - until the \"painting\" begins moving, and drives off, it being just a piece of a soft drink advert pinned to the side of a truck that was parked outside a gallery window.\"Deliberately slow-paced\"? I don't mind slow-paced movies, not at all, but watching minute after minute of slow walking and talking about nothing in particular while the important issues remain completely unmentioned, is a bit too much. \"Brilliant in its meaning\"? _What_ meaning, excuse me? I cannot find any possible interesting explanation of its ending, really - the only two meanings I can see is one horribly shallow, cheap sappy excuse for a romantic sacrifice dressed in an old \"meaning of humanity\" robe, or a big twist beyond any possible reasoning. The former being surprisingly more likely.** SPOILERS **  - my quick overview of what, in my opinion, went wrong in the movie.First of all, who in their right mind sends a single civilian to a space station, when previously a military task force failed in there?Next, suppose your deceased beloved one materializes next to you. Would your first impulse be to chat a bit and then simply kill that person again (as they're not real anyway), then watch them reappear, and then become emotionally attached to them again? Sounds weird, doesn't it? But that's what Clooney does in there.This only gets worse in the ending. Clooney sees a vision of his own \"clone\" (cloone?:) on Earth, and decides to stay on the crash-coursed station. Why? For the sake of his dead wife that wasn't even there? Come on. But if it is so, what does this \"Clooney-clone on Earth\" stuff mean? It just doesn't make sense at all. The only thing that comes to my mind is \"we are all clones created by someone\", but I refuse to believe in such a banal idea, which actually doesn't fit in that moment anyway.** END OF SPOILERS **So what point the movie is trying to make, remains a mystery to me. \"We live only for the ones we love, even when they're dead\"? Please. \"We only exist when someone remembers us\"? Not explored enough. \"Everything is just an illusion\"?? Puh-leeease...!!In a nutshell, the biggest problem with this movie was its pride. It presents itself like a piece of deep, meaningful art, giving time to think, to absorb, to conclude... but there is nothing to think of. The message is shallow and undecided, jumping from Harlequin romance to weary existence questions, like a hamburger served on a silver plate. There is nothing new in this movie, except exceptional boredom. It failed as a \"cerebral movie\", it failed as a SF, it failed as a romance. I'm sorry, but it is simply a bad movie defended only by an old \"you don't like it because you don't understand it!\" line. Yeah, been there, done that. 2/10.",

We've had horror (\"Out of Sight\"), drama (\"Erin Brockovich\"), gritty realism (\"Traffic\"), comedy (\"Ocean's Eleven\"), and now romance in \"Solaris,\" a film that blew me out of the water - in terms of I was so surprised it sucked.I think this may be the very first film that Steven Soderbergh made that is bad - followed by that stinky \"Collinwood\" movie. It is a nod towards Stanley Kubrick, but most of the film - especially sequences like the docking ship - just seem like hopeless rip-offs. James Cameron was originally going to write and direct this film, but then Soderbergh jumped on board so Cameron produced it. I wish they had let him write and direct it. Not only would it have been much more...hmm...how should I put it...INTERESTING, it would also be about ten times more meaningful than this sorry mess.The film (based upon a novel and previous film titled \"Solaryis\") takes place sometime in the future, when a pshrink named Chris Klein (George Clooney) is sent to a space station on the planet Solaris to rescue a crew of space explorers. Once there, he realizes why no one wants to leave. Chris' dead wife comes back to him in the space station - she looks real, she feels real, she acts real - but she is undoubtedly an image from his memory, extracted by the mysterious planet. Soon he realizes that he cannot take her back to earth, and he must cope with the fact that she must be destroyed. But she seems so real he refuses to do so. Oh my, the suspense, the suspense.What an intriguing idea we have, completely wasted with an incompetent script and style of direction. The characters act weird throughout. For example, when Chris first arrives at the space station and finds people dead, he also finds a survivor named Snow. Chris doesn't seem to ask many questions. He asks what happened, and the Snow character (who is also very weird) doesn't answer correctly. Chris just kind of walks away, and finds another survivor. Once again, he gets no answers. So what does he do? He goes to sleep. Everyone in this movie just acts weird. I can't describe it in words - they just don't act right. Even the humans. This may very well be George Clooney's most washed-out performance to date.And the actor who played Snow, Jeremy Davies, is one of the worst actors I have ever seen. He plays the exact same characters (notice the similarities to his character in \"The Million Dollar Hotel\" to his character in \"Solaris\"). In fact, \"Solaris\" is a lot like \"The Million Dollar Hotel.\" I hated that movie with a personal vengeance.On the DVD commentary track for \"Solaris,\" James Cameron said, \"If I had made it there would be a lot more car chases, more gunfights.\" Quite honestly, I wish there were. Cameron would have made this film interesting, with or without violence and extravagant special effects, even. Soderbergh simply makes a melodramatic snoozer that is as boring as it is odd and ridiculous.1/5 stars -John Ulmer",

However, I was not prepared for how incredibly banal Soderbergh's version turned out to be. This film is, quite frankly, a BOMB.There is little to say other than the fact that despite Soderbergh's first-rate craftsmanship, as a director, he lacks power; he is not of the first-rank of cinema artists, not matter how much he strives to be. He is not even in Spielberg's class of being an uber-technician/craftsman as at least Speilberg, even at his most banal, can deliver the goods. The new \"Solaris\" IS BORING.The film is a terrible misfire. Focusing on the relationship of Kelvin and his \"wife\" to all else saps the film of the power of Tarkovsky's classic, which I always characterized as a more intellectual \"2001.\" This film lacks the philosophical power of the Tarkovsky film. In sum, Soderberg's version of \"Solaris\" is relentlessly SHALLOW.Clooney is not appropriately cast, and his lack of acting chops robs the audience of identification as there is no character development that a fine actor like Kevin Spacey could give this role. Clooney's performance never really develops, his character never really changes; Kelvin, as played by Clooney, is a depressed wimp at the beginning and throughout the film. It's strange to see an actor as macho as Clooney playing a character on the border of hysteria. It might have made sense if we watched the character deteriorate, but as it was played, the character is poorly realized.As for the other actors, Natasha McElhone is better than she was in FearDot.Com, and this is NOT like saying Pauley Shore was better in SON-IN-LAW than he was in BIO-DOME; she's not only beautiful, but gives a decent performance; however, what she lacks is star power, the charisma that a star like Julia Roberts can bring to a picture, thus making Kelvin's yearning and his ultimate decision more real. McElhone just isn't up to the demands of the role as realized in this film (as opposed to Tarkovsky's \"Solyaris,\" where the character is not quite as prominent). She lacks weight. While I don't think it's her fault as much as the director's, many times she struck me as having been teleported in from a shampoo commercial. She is just there to look pretty in some interminable sequences that scream \"STUDENT FILM.\" I guess this is Soderbergh's way of reclaiming his \"art house\" roots, but frankly, it's ridiculous, as is some of the dialogue, which is just plain bad, not even bad enough to border on camp (and thus give the audience some pleasure).Jeremy Davies, who was so excellent in PRIVATE RYAN, quickly is solidifying his reputation as the worst actor on celluloid. Here, he channels the spirit of Travis Bickle, but Mr. Davies, you are no Robert DeNiro. It's becoming excruciating watching Davies in any movie; each movie, he is actually getting worse.On an upbeat note, Viola Davis was good.I voted this film a \"2\" (as the production design is excellent, as is the soundtrack), but is really is a BOMB.Beware a Michaelangelo-inspired visual motif towards the end when Soderbergh really begins channeling the spirit of Stanley Kubrick.Stephen, I knew Kubrick and you're not Kubrick, nor will you ever be.The Web site for \"Solaris\" presents the film as being from two Academy Award winners, James Cameron and Soderbergh.

It may as well have taken place at a cabin on a lake in Maine.  In this respect, it betrays the legacies of both Lem and Tarkovsky.Second, the questions it raises are not particularly profound ones.  Do we feel guilt and how does it affect us?  Is memory reality?  What would we do when given a second chance, and would it trivialize all we have previously experienced?  Unfortunately, these are developed and explored no better than the hypothetical question, \"If you could be invisible, what would you do?\" And where Soderbergh apparently wishes to address issues in casual conversation, the thoughts of these supposedly highly-educated and experienced individuals are, in fact, quite banal. Third, the acting is above-average, but not in any way exceptional.  I truly am a rationalist and skeptic, just like Clooney's character, and I did not identify with his character or his situation at all. Finally, the movie is indeed very slowly paced.  No, I wasn't looking for giant bugs or technical dissertations on cryo-sleep...I just wanted some advancement of the plot...or at least some character development.In summary, this movie is slightly interesting, but it is ultimately frustrating and unfulfilling.  Like some other reviewers, I kept bringing up the time remaining display on the DVD player and thinking, \"I've still got 45 minutes of this to sit through?\"Rating:  * out of ****",

Basically, the movie took an awe-inspiring \"what if\" thought experiment - of finding a very advanced non-human intelligence (which, surprise surprise, doesn't have two arms, two legs, a body and a head) and the problems of trying to communicate with such a radically different being, especially when it doesn't seem interested in communication, and how we can relate to it with our own limited human experience, and squeezed out all the juicy intellectual bits. Solaris was supposed to be the real star of the story and the screenplay instead turned it into background wallpaper. All that was left then, was a sappy love story set in space. It is frustrating to think about the potential that was wasted. Mr. Soderbergh could have made a classic sci-fi film here, if only he'd made an honest attempt.The funny thing is, if I hadn't read the book I would have liked the film, because it is well directed and has a nice atmospheric mood. There's nothing inherently wrong with love stories either. Just.. call it something other than Solaris, give the characters different names, don't do anything to remind me of the original story and I'd say it is a good movie. But as it is, it's an extreme disappointment.",

A military unit is sent to investigate but they also go out of contact, while attempts to raise the space station's AI unit on board fail as the crew have disabled it. The only hope for the company is a message sent from crew member Gibarian to his old friend Chris Klein \u0096 inviting him to come to the space station and help the crew. Klein is himself a troubled psychologist but Gibarian seems to think that Klein's \"experience\" will make him useful.As if I didn't have enough reasons to admire George Clooney and Steven Soderbergh, here I find myself with another one in this marvellously engaging remake. Those looking for a sci-fi filled with mystery and answers will be disappointed as this is very much in the hearts of the characters and is not anything like Event Horizon (how I laughed as I read complaints about that from my fellow reviewers). To me this was not so much about where it was going, or getting answers at the end but about the individual scenes and the internal struggles of Chris and Rheya. The downside of this is that some scenes are weak and there isn't really a narratively satisfying conclusion. This didn't matter too much to me because the film did an amazing job of being emotionally engaging within the context of a sci-fi. I was easily drawn into the history between the two characters and the reasons for their intense feelings \u0096 which is where the story exists. I understand why the film failed to set the box office alight here in the UK but this is easily one of the most interesting films I've seen out of Hollywood in the last few years.Soderbergh's direction is excellent. All at once it is controlled and rather detached while also bringing out the emotion in the story. The editing together of sequences is inspired and the whole film has a feeling of not being totally real \u0096 like a dream of sorts, which I suppose is very much the point of it. He benefits from a couple of tremendous performances and several good ones. Clooney is excellent and he is matched by McElhone. Both are convincing and make the film as engaging as it was, how their performances never showed up on my awards radar I don't know. At its best the film is a two-hander but the support is good from Davies, Davis and Tukur.Overall this is an emotionally convincing and engaging film. The sci-fi element is interesting and leaves a nice air once the film is finished but the real hook is the emotional development of the characters both in real time and flashback. As time and place become less clearly defined, the emotions become stronger and the film gets better. I can understand why some people disliked this but I enjoyed it immensely.",

Soderbergh has managed to leave out just about everything that could justify the title (as Lem himself put it, if he had set out to write a book about space romance, he would have called it Love in Outer Space, not Solaris).

Other strange events soon start happening, such as the appearance of old acquaintances of the crew, including some who are dead. Klein struggles with the questions of Solaris' motivation, his beliefs and memories, and reconciling what was lost with an opportunity for a second chance.Gripping, absorbing, thought provoking and wonderfully filmed, I enjoyed this an insane amount. I use it as one of my relaxing movies on a night to help me fall asleep (I don't mean that as a bad thing) as there are long periods of no dialogue and just beautiful music which I drift off too. Another movie I do this to, is the Burt Reynolds movie \"Sharky's Machine\" and his character is on stakeout duty. Again little or no dialogue just the score and I nod off. Clooney and Natasha McElhone make a wonderful couple and have some good on screen chemistry. I'm surprised they have not worked together again, but when a movie tanks like this did, actors like to distance themselves as much as possible. I think whoever was behind the promotion for this movie dropped the ball as they didn't know how to \"sell\" this movie, as the trailers and posters do not represent the movie at all, and can see why people thought they were going to see something else.",

He then watched \"Terminator 3,\" which he enjoyed.After he went off to bed. I started \"Solaris.\" Unlike my husband, I was hooked from the start, and thoroughly enjoyed being reeled in. This is what I look for in a film - a compelling, nuanced story, involving complex characters. Perhaps it appealed to me more than to some, because I have lost several loved ones in recent years, including my father who died three years ago today, and am therefore wrestling with the same questions pondered in the film. Or perhaps I'm just a sucker for a good story, deftly told.I don't think we would have necessarily had a better or worse film had Cameron written the screenplay, merely a different film altogether. I give him more credit than many on this board, as \"The Abyss\" is and remains a favorite film of mine, and only defied the laws of physics a few times. ;-) Certainly \"The Abyss\" is a quieter and more introspective film than the Terminator series, but then again, the films do examine the same themes. It might have been interesting to see what Cameron would have done with \"Solaris,\" hopefully sans car chases.Personally, I am glad Soderbergh wrote this version, as there is very little I would change. I enjoyed every minute of it. The musical score captured and enhanced the atmosphere quite well. I remember hearing about the original \"Solaris,\" which came out the year I started high school, but I never saw it. Having now seen this version, I'll make it a point to do so, and I'll read the book as well. I will definitely be adding this film to my collection.As for my husband, I probably won't recommend that he see it right away. Instead, I'll let him see it over time, as he did \"The Shipping News,\" which also put him off initially. Once he got past the move to Newfoundland, he began to understand the humor I saw in the film, but he still despises its more depressing aspects. Still, he considers my taste in films weird, and to date understands neither my love for \"Jacob's Ladder\" nor my devotion to \"Six Feet Under.\"But then, he doesn't like jazz, either. ;-)",

Here's why: this version concentrates almost entirely on the love story at its centre and to carry its ideas through successfully, the relationship at its core has to be believable - which it clearly isn't. There is simply no chemistry at all between the two leads; I've seen more sexual sparks created between Shaggy and Scooby.

He started life with 'Sex Lies,' a minor gem. In between his slickly wrapped cowpatties, he's shoehorned in some work that gives us hope: his 'Limey' was all about the perceptive eye. 'Frontal' was intelligently the obverse.He likes to be his own cinematographer and editor. He likes to work with 'simple' actors, those who know nothing about the larger issues of film and don't care: they just do their thing.This man has been able to live a double life until now, shifting between stupid films that made money and art which justifies a life. Depending on what world we live in, we forgave his excursions into the other. Now he tries something dangerous: both at the same time.The story and the existing Tarkovsky film are lovely explorations into the matter of created realities, intrusive memory and the nature of film creation. The Tarkovsky treatment took advantage of the fact that he was first someone who lived in a folded world of symmetries and hidden causality. His camera is highly architectural, it lingers and discovers truths in odd places, it incidentally discovers. It is not a knowing eye, but a languorous, understanding one involved in a complex set of t'ai chi movements.It shows a lot of courage for Soderbergh to enter this world of illusion, especially with Cameron in charge, someone whose notion of meditative image is a world that explodes slowly, accompanied by elevator music. Once again, Soderbergh uses actors that are too ignorant of the issues involved to get in the way.Where Tarkovsky had an eye rooted in the created world, Soderbergh stays in the real world. Where T's eye lingered, S's eye could have stuttered -- something S knows how to do. Instead, he plays it straight. We have no intelligent eye here at all. T had sets like 'Rear Windows,' where the actual architecture is a response to the nature of the eye. S has a shockingly ordinary space, similar in notion to the O'Hare terminal in Chicago. His eye never has a relationship at all with the space.There are a few interesting ambiguities, but these are all plot devices, not cinematic ones: we do not know if Gordan is a replicant; we do not know if the last scene takes place on 'real' Earth, or in a fabricated Earth in the real Kelvin's mind. We do not know the extent to which Gibarian's son is involved in the conspiracy to get Kelvin \"home,\" and his relationship to an inferred affair between Gibarian and Rheya. All we have is the doorknob.Kelvin went on a watered down journey, but Soderbergh never answered the call.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 4: Has some interesting elements.",

The main question presented here is simple but profound: Do we, can we, really know another human being? Do we see others, even those closest to us, as they really are, or merely as extensions of ourselves? And does the answer to that question ultimately even matter? No doubt \"Solaris\" will be perceived as too cerebral by many-a disappointment without exchanges of blaster fire and not a single alien monster exploding out of someone's chest. To be clear, I loved both \"Aliens\" and \"Star Wars,\" but there is room under the SciFi umbrella for a more thoughtful approach to the genre. This is a beautiful, moody, contemplative piece, punctuated by moments of awe and anguish. There is a moment near the end (in fact it should have been the end IMO) where George Clooney's character has embraced an unknowable fate, chasing a dream of lost love, and reaches out-like Adam to God in Michelangelo's famous painting-toward another being, toward hope, that is filled with such inexpressible longing and regret, it has left me shaken every time I've seen it (if I seem coy about the details, I don't want to give anything away).

If you wanted to remake Solaris as an episode of the Twilight Zone this is what you would boil the story down to.  The original had a love story in it but it was not a love story.And the original was a piece of cinema.  It told its story in pictures.  In the remake, once Kelvin arrives at Solaris, no one shuts up.  There's a constant yammering explanation of what is going on.  Everything has to be explained.  It's the difference between 2001 and 2010.  Sometimes mystery is better.Forgetting the original, does it work as a stand alone movie?  Again, it's not visual enough, you could do the script as it stands on the radio and no one would be lost.  As for the acting?  Clooney is Clooney, nice looking and can move about without bumping into the furniture, but there's always something missing from the man on screen: he lacks emotional weight. Natasha McElhone?  Awful.  The flashback scenes where she and Clooney are falling in love are an embarrassment.  It's as though she's trying to break the world grinning record.

Funny what a difference a couple of years make with the inclusion of additional visitors to the title.Before watching this picture I had no knowledge of the novel by Stanislaw Lem or the original Russian movie based on it. So without contaminating my review with the perspectives of those two works, what I thought started out as a pretty good sci-fi mystery turned into an illogical love story aboard a space station. I thought there were all kinds of problems here, principally starting with the main character, Chris Kelvin (George Clooney). He was introduced as an intellectual and level headed psychiatrist who was invited to Solaris because of unexplained occurrences that were driving the scientists on board insane. Fair enough, but when he himself experiences the impossible, he abruptly turns off his brain in order to resume a failed relationship with the woman who was his wife (Natascha McElhone) on Earth. Why? How does that even make sense? There's also inconsistency with the character of Rheya. The 'first' Rheya who appears on Solaris has memories of her past with Kelvin, but the 'second' Rheya' doesn't. Until she does again when flashes of life on Earth intrude on her memory. I'm really bothered by internal consistencies in a story, and the two I just mentioned were big time ones.What I really like about well written sci-fi flicks though, is the scientific gobbledy-gook that writers come up with in service to a story. You could have blown me away with that description of the Higgs device - a high energy proton accelerator with a matter phase modulator, which by adjusting the tuning frequency, you could get an enhancement of Higgs anti-bosons at ninety gigahertz, and even better, an almost pure beam at a hundred sixty gigahertz.See, if I were writing the story, Kelvin could have saved himself a lot of trouble by cranking up the Higgs to a full one eighty, thereby reversing the mass exponentiality of the Solaris gravitational field. Then, by switching to decoupled internal power, he could have calibrated the external high-grain antenna and set a course back to Earth, one that wouldn't have jeopardized the possibility of bringing an alien life force back with him. If he wanted to see Rheya again, he could have depressurized the spin turbines on the Athena, settled back with a brandy, and made love to his heart's content. I guess the simplest explanation is just too obvious.",

While a remake of Tarkovsky's so called \"anti 2001\" (remake in the sense that they share the same source material), Soderbergh's squeaky clean medical lab future owes a lot to the visuals and pacing of the nowadays rarely viewed Silent Running. The camera creeps molasses-like through ice blue corridors exhibiting the emptiness and perhaps soulless potential of futuristic design and technology. In fact, emptiness and isolation play a large role right off the bat as the film begins with our eventual space traveler Chris Kelvin (George Clooney) wafting through the muted colors of Earth. Mostly shown from behind and in company with blurred individuals, Kelvin is isolated even around the drab public. With the way technology has been making human contact more and more impersonal over time, this seems a frighteningly accurate portrayal of how we will all feel in due time.The heart of the story though is based in the space station hovering around the gaseous tendrils of the planet Solaris. Kelvin travels to see if he can help out a friend in a crisis, but this of course leads him on a most mysterious journey. The barren station becomes even more prison-esquire than the grimy locales we saw on Earth, with only two human inhabitants on board, as well as some characters that may or may not be so human. Soderbergh respects his audience and asks them to leave passive viewing at home so they too can try to figure out what is being presented to Kelvin. What defines us as human? If there is such phenomena occurring like on the ship, how does that figure into religious views? Kelvin is forced to question all of his previous beliefs and the film, which is just vague enough in the ideas it presents, forces us to do the same. This is a finely crafted, deliberately paced, and truly exotic experience, the likes of which is rarely seen (or funded) today.",

A great actor like Clooney and with the creative genius of Steven Soderbergh? How do we get this level of horse apples? I also want to mention George Clooney's tush. Because this film has the tush roughly three times. And while I respect Clooney for adding to the realism, I'm very sorry for the Clooney admirers who have to sit through this just to see a firm, shaved tush.But seriously, I should have known this film was a dud as soon as Corey Feldman showed up. In his first scene, he's listening to Insane Clown Posse (Because obviously in the future everyone loves rapping clowns). And throughout the film, he acts like a lunatic with wild gestures. It looks exactly like David Duchovny's impression of Jeff Goldblum from Saturday Night Live's \"Celebrity Jeopardy\".

I took away a lot from this film and did a fair bit of pondering.Reactions in the room were mixed. One friend just laughed out loud with a look that suggested he just didn't get any of it, and had been thoroughly bored. I personally don't understand how you can't get this film, but it demonstrates that it's not for everyone. Then again, I know people who never once laughed at The Big Lebowski, so...Maybe it's me getting old and sentimental, but I found the interplay between Chris and Rheya, both in the past and on the space station to be quite beautifully written and acted. Through snapshots of their relationship and her growing recall of events leading to her death, you are treated to a subtly understated but powerful insight into their relationship. I found watching them through the flashbacks to be tender, touching, romantic and tragic. It's quite gently understated and softly underplayed by Clooney and McElhorne. For me, it's rare to be moved in such a way.Others have remarked on the great existential themes within Solaris, so I won't bang on about them. Suffice to say, this should be in anyone's collection. Show it to your kids and make their brains and hearts swell.",

A kind of dreamy, romantic 2001.You won't really get this film... I think that is its biggest appeal. It's truly mysterious and un-defined... But to be totally honest, isn't Space, real Space, like that???Who knows what kind of forces exists out there in the Void... Who knows their true nature...? This film captures that sense of the Great Unknown and twists it into a very moving love story, which revolves around George Clooney's character and his dead wife (the beautiful Natascha McElhone).And at the centre of this film... Solaris... A place, an entity, an alien artifact, a space-time anomaly... Who knows...?To be honest, I've yet to work out 2001 and 2010... I've yet to read the books which might, perhaps, give me further insights, but those films are still very mysterious to me... That's why I love them...The same goes for this film... If you're one of those people who doesn't mind being faced with more questions than answers... Then check this beautiful film out... You WON'T be disappointed...If on the other hand, you're one of those people who wants, no NEEDS an answer to absolutely EVERYTHING... Then stay well away...Remember, Space is BIG... And holds more questions than we can EVER hope to answer... So embrace the mystery, don't be afraid of it...",

            "review_title": "Hauntingly beautiful (CAUTION: SPOILERS)",
            "content": "About 20 minutes into \"Solaris,\" I noticed that there were some strong similarities between this film and the video game \"Silent Hill 2\" (this is a positive comparison, mind you, but I won't get into a discussion of SH2 here). My friend had asked me to rent it, and to be honest, I was wary of it, at first. I had heard bad things about it, and was prepared for it to be truly awful. What I got, instead, was one of the most beautiful and tragic things I've ever seen. Chris Kelvin (George Clooney) is a psychologist who has ample emotional baggage of his own. He is quiet and brooding, never letting on the torment that is going on in his mind. The pattern of his mundane life is disrupted when a couple of strangers show up with an ominous message: Chris's friend, Gibrarian (Ulrich Tukur), who is in charge of a space ship that is investigating the planet Solaris, cryptically begs Chris to come to the ship and help them, never quite divulging what is wrong. Chris obliges, and before too long, has arrived on the ship. However, he finds that Gibrarian, along with one of the other scientists, is already dead. The only survivors are Snow (Jeremy Davies), who seems eerily detached from all the madness that surrounds him, and Gordon (Viola Davis), who is paranoid and suspicious of everyone, especially Chris. Chris is unable to convince Snow and Gordon to leave right away, unsure of what is going on. In the night, Chris is visited by the apparition of his wife, Rheya (Natascha McElhone), who has been dead for three years. Thinking it a dream, Chris awakes, only to find out that Rheya is all too real.As it turns out, Solaris, for better or worse, creates 'visitors' for the crew members of the ship, which are fashioned from their feelings and memories. These visitors are manifestations of guilt, of regret, of longing, and of love. Chris, blaming himself for Rheya's suicide, is unable to fully comprehend the idea that the visitor is not real, because he so desperately needs the second chance that Rheya's 'ghost' represents. Therefore, he fights tooth and nail with Gordon, who wants to destroy Rheya and go back to earth. However, Rheya's increasing self-awareness drives her to despair, as she realizes she is not the Rheya that Chris remembers, and therefore allows herself to be destroyed. However, the ship itself is in grave danger. Snow's eerie calm was a mask for his deranged state of mind...and his treachery causes the ship to be put on a crash course with Solaris. Although Gordon is able to leave the ship, Chris, upon rumination, is not. He is left behind with Snow to face whatever is in the heart of Solaris, and what exactly he finds there is open to debate, without a doubt. Whatever it is, it provides peace, love, and forgiveness for his tortured soul. \"Solaris,\" from it's gray, dark opening, to its beautiful, mystifying conclusion, is stunning. The music is amazingly haunting and lingers in your mind long after the last chord has faded. The visuals are stunning, and each scene is a work of great beauty. The clean, cold nature of the ship contrasts sharply with the raw power of emotion flowing between the four main characters, as they struggle with reality and unreality, and what they are and what they are not. The acting is remarkable, as well. I was a big fan of Clooney's performance in \"O Brother Where Art Thou,\" but his work here was amazing. Fantastic. He really conveyed the brooding and suffering plaguing Kelvin's psyche, making the role his own. Natascha McElhone is also wonderfully cast as Rheya. Her confusion, her pain, and her mysterious, evasive nature are all portrayed beautifully. Both of these characters elicit so much love, sympathy, and frustration, that it's amazing how much you find yourself caring about and mourning for two souls that are as adrift as they are. Davis, Davies, and Tukur all do fine acting jobs, as well, to their credit. Davis is the force of reason on the ship, yet somewhat ominous, because one wonders who...or what...her visitor could be. Davies, the manic Snow, portrays the spooky character perfectly. He's excitable, and hyperactive, to be sure...yet, he doesn't seem to be bothered by anything around him. Tukur, as Gibrarian, really enhances the scenes he is in. The scene in which he converses with Chris from beyond the grave is very haunting and is a particular stand-out. Rarely have I seen a film that evokes as much emotion or portrays as much beauty as this one. Everything, from the sets, to the effects, to the acting, music, and visual style, form together to create a work of near perfection. My only complaint was that it was too short!What happens to Chris when he enters the heart of Solaris? There is no definitive answer to it, but trying to find one is a great exercise for the mind. See this movie with someone you love. (Next time I see my girlfriend, she's being forced to watch this...I think it would have an even more profound emotional impact on couples) 10/10",

Because of this the approach just doesn't really work out for the movie. The movie also doesn't ever really properly build up things. Things just happen as they come along, making it all the more harder to understand or find ever realistic. It's also the reason why the movie is fairly short. It's especially short when considering the movie its source material and when comparing it to the 1972 first version of the movie, that is over an hour longer. I'll bet that the movie is even worse and more confusing to follow when you haven't read the Stanislaw Lem novel, or have seen the 1972 Soviet version of the movie, by Andrei Tarkovsky. Since then you'll probably have simply no idea what this movie is all about.The movie doesn't feature any deeper meanings to it, as if Steven Sodenbergh didn't really understood any of the meanings of the original story. Or perhaps he simply tried to make a simplified and more mainstream version. It just totally misses its mark and fails on basically every level. For a mystery it's just way too confusing and doesn't have the right atmosphere for it, for a drama its not involving enough and for a romantic movie it just isn't credible, mainly because of Natascha McElhone.Of course the movie is still great looking and Steven Soderbergh is of course still a very skilled director, despite really missing the mark with this movie.It's also nice to see the actors at work, despite not being given great material to work with. George Clooney is always great in any movie and in any type of role. Most other roles in the movie though sort of leave a pointless impression, or at least not significant enough for the story, with the exception of the Natascha McElhone character of course but I don't know, she is just an actress who always sort of annoys me.Confusing, non-engaging mess, that misses its mark, despite it's wonderful and powerful source material.4/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

It's a good plot, but the screenplay is extremely slow in it's pace.  In an attempt to be intriguing and enigmatic, it ends up being boring.  I think it was meant to inspire thought on the nature of religion and higher powers, but the story just dabbles and fails to complete the thought.The acting and directing keep this from being a bad movie by a long shot, but wait for it to show on cable.

I might be young but then in my young and somewhat naive life I have experienced a bit with love and loss and I know how it feels, and I know what it can drive a person to do. George Clooney puts that on the table and shows us how most of us felt. Solaris is a weird film with a lot of emotions running through , it touches on themes of loss , grievances and not to mention acceptance which is the the most important part of the ordeal. George Clooney and Natasha McElorne do a wonderful job of taking us on a journey , I also believe in an artistic way that it is not made to make any sort of sense but in a way Steven Sodburgh wants us to just delve into our-selves , nothing gained and nothing lost...well for me anyway. The only thing I can truly say about Solaris is that if you have really felt love and lost it , and know the after shock that it leaves then it would be worth a look at. If your expecting a sci-fi Star Wars adventure then leave it. SOLARIS - 8.1 OUT OF 10There are some places that man is not ready to go...",

Thus said we see immediately that all the originality is left out of this Cloony- Solaris version.A meager love story...and never coming close to the esoterically bestranening appearances of the Wife in the Tarkovsky film.Somehow Soderbergh needed his film 'to make sense'. and that's the greatest failure in this very meager version of Lem's book & Tarkovsky's masterpiece.

I couldn't remember much of the plot, but I did remember the strange, dream-like visitors and also magnificent views from the windows of the Solaris space station.  Now, in the original, CG had not been invented.  So, the Russian director took photos from an airplane (or from a balloon??) of Earth's oceans, and used those to represent the surface of Solaris.  The space station had huge picture windows, letting in glorious sunlight, and you looked out on this beautiful, powerful ocean a lot.  It was just stunning.Now, the CG Solaris is also interesting, but somehow not as powerful or as beautiful.  Hollywood is going nuts over CG right now, and CG is definitely a lot of fun, but it's not a real substitute for some of what used to go before.Still, I did like this remake.  I must say that the high point was the nude scene.  This was just a GORGEOUS scene.  Really.  George Clooney has just the most fabulous shoulders and the lighting and filtering were very artistic.  It is definitely worth going to the movie just for this scene -- full size on the big screen (at least if you're a straight woman or a gay man).  You'll notice that somehow I still find the natural more beautiful than the CG.Now why isn't this movie R?  Because it was a back nude and not a front nude?  Does this make sense?  Surely you wouldn't want to take your kid to it even when it is rated PG.  It's heavy duty psychological and your kid won't understand it at all -- just flip out at the nude scene and possibly also over the suicides.   Anyway, as to the plot, there isn't too much of one.  It's more a bunch of questions.  What would we do when faced with an alien intelligence that attempts to communicate with us by mirroring to each individual the strongest images out of his or her subconscious?  Commit murder?  Kill ourselves?  Become weird hermits locked in our bedrooms?  Try to erase the images?  Try to cling to them?  How would the alien respond to any of those actions?  Could we ever get past the images and actually communicate with the alien in a way that would seem more meaningful to us rather than to the alien?  What did the alien actually learn from all  this?  Did people, armed with foreknowledge, ever try this experiment again -- possibly more successfully?  Don't expect answers to all of these questions, though.It's all very thoughtful and I really liked George Clooney in this.  I might shift loyalties to him from my current favorite movie star.",

            "content": "NOTE: Spoilers for Solyaris too.For me this version stripped away a lot of what made Tarkovsky's Solyaris so interesting. Solaris turned into a more simple movie about a guy dealing with a regret. Perhaps it went a little larger, and was about dealing with painful memories. (I couldn't escape the sense that it was 9/11 influenced - from the scene early on with people talking in a room about their reactions to painful memories that was sounding a lot like 9/11). But overall it missed exploring the bigger questions that Solyaris raises. There's still more substance here than your average Hollywood film but I much preferred the way Tarkovsky went deeper into every idea.Some interesting ideas from Solyaris that were only lightly explored in Solaris - Exploring the concept of creation - Solyaris created the living memories from the minds of the scientists so in a way Kelvin was the god of his dead wife. The way in which Hari was more aware than Rheya and fought more for her humanity made this connection more interesting. She did not just want to kill herself she and truly struggled with who she was and why she existed. (as humans could do as well if they are posed the right questions). She also eventually had to come to terms with the discovery that while they had were once been in love, their relationship had ended before her death (humanity abandoned by 'god'?). This changed in Soderbergh's Solaris and made it more focused on Kelvin's character and I felt weakened it overall because of it.Solaris also missed the scientist's plan to beam their waking thoughts down to the surface so it could understand them better. There was no strong suggestion of threat as found in Solaris (another post 9/11 influence?). There was just curiosity from the planet and the possibility that human-like intelligence was not as unique as we often like to think.I like the idea of having your memory brought to life, having to face it and interact with it, while also having it exposed in front of people you don't know, but Soderbergh's version made it all about Kelvin and missed some of the greater questions about humanity that Tarkovsky was able to explore.Ignore the long car sequence (apparently kept in the film so he could justify his crew's trip to Japan), I recommend watching Solyaris if you can. It may be slower paced, but it eventually goes much deeper.",

            "content": "I hate writing reviews for movies like this. Why? Because there are important revelations everywhere, there are truths revealed throughout, and every detail mentioned is a potential spoiler. But, the way to avoid this is to address the techniques, performances, and specific aspects of the film I liked. So, while this review may not be as thorough as some of my others or nearly as helpful, I'll address as much as is reasonable.First off, I haven't seen the original directed by Andrei Tarkovsky. But, I do know that Tarkovsky believed that a brilliant movie was never entertaining. I disagree with the proclaimed movie genius in every way, but then comes Solaris, yet another Hollywood remake of a classic and another of Soderbergh's projects. Through this movie, I understand what Tarkovsky meant (though I still disagree). This movie is deliberately slowly paced, so much so that there is no huge climax or booming plot points. Instead, Soderbergh has opted to create an extremely artistic reflection of love and the choices we make surrounding it.A great deal of this movie relies on the music to carry the scene. Luckily, Cliff Martinez composes what is unquestionably the best musical score of the year. There is very little dialogue so the actors are often forced to, well, act. This movie truly believes that actions are stronger than words. Kelvin is faced with an extremely perplexing situation. We learn that his wife committed suicide years ago on Earth, and her suicide was partially Kelvin's fault. The planet then comes into play; it is the apparent cause of these \"beings\" solidifying on the space station. The planet can only create a \"being\" based on the information in a person's mind, so Kelvin is faced with a being that is a reflection of what he remembers as his wife. Not his actual wife. He deals with this first by jettisoning the first image of his wife into space, but of course she appears again after he falls asleep. Even more interesting is that from the birth of a \"being,\" they are their own person. They can reflect on the past and even judge themselves. Rheya starts to figure out herself that she isn't actually Kelvin's wife.Sci-fi fans will be sorely disappointed because even though there are some beautiful special effects here, they are extremely rare. The sci-fi elements are present only to initiate the plot and give a few nudges to move it along from time to time. This movie is for any patient viewer who can stay awake during long periods of silence, at least in terms of dialogue. Clooney fans will mostly be alienated because the normally verbose actor is limited to looks, expression of feelings, and other such techniques (women will be pleased at the continual exposure of his posterior). He delivers what is arguably his best performance ever in a very respectable acting career. If he continues teaming up with Soderbergh, a golden statue may be in his near future. A welcome surprise was a very good performance Natascha McElhone as Rheya. I normally don't like McElhone much, but as the mysterious Rheya she changes emotions in a heartbeat and gives us all we need to know with her actions. Maybe it's the fact that her big beautiful eyes and wide grin can say so much without a sound that helps her in this kind of movie. Regardless, she really keeps the movie alive at certain points when she needs to. Otherwise, she gladly takes second billing to Clooney. The rest of the cast is not much to talk about. There are fewer characters here than in any other movie I can remember.The best part about Solaris is that it doesn't throw emotion at us, but instead proposes ideas to us. The more patient moviegoer will have time to ponder these ideas and discuss them with others. My mind stopped and grabbed the line \"I was haunted by the idea that I didn't remember her right.\" You can get a migraine from that one line and the many ways you can read into it. In one way, it's ironic because none of us can remember anyone \"right\" regardless of how much we love them or how well we know them. Along the same line, our emotions can be a projection of one thing onto another. Clooney hanging on to this image of his wife is no more ridiculous than crying during a movie. We know the people and most often the events are fictional, but sometimes the waterworks just can't be stopped.In the end, I found Solaris to be much less confusing than I expected, though there a few twists and surprises that were challenging to say the least. The words, while few in number, are meaningful and never unnecessary. Soderbergh's direction is as ample as always; Erin Brockovich, Traffic (overrated, but well directed), Ocean's Eleven, and now Solaris. Not a bad resume over the past few years. I have a feeling that producer James Cameron may have given him an assist on some of the sci-fi points. I can't emphasize enough that you will only like this movie if you are extremely patient and have a taste for artistic films. But, if you fit the profile, I wouldn't be surprised if you are completely sucked in by this introspective piece.",

            "content": "I decided to see this film at the worst time, probably: Sick, in bed, sleeping 20 hours of the day. The day I felt a bit better, I decided I would like to watch a film. This one had come in as an add-on with the TV magazine, and I remembered seeing the posters way back in 2002 (for some reason I didn't go and see it then. Pity.). So, popped the DVD into my laptop, got my good earphones, and crawled back into bed. If you now think I fell asleep after 10 minutes, you are wrong. Despite my state, I was mesmerized. This is something I hadn't come across for a long time.From the moment you see Chris Kelvin (Clooney) sitting on his bed, head in hands, and hear the voice of Rheya (McElhone) in voice-over you know that this is not going to be a normal sci-fi film. You witness Kelvin act out the things of everyday life, making appointments with clients, holding group sessions as a psychologist, but you feel quite early on that there are demons from his past haunting him. Soderbergh also enhances this by keeping the focus on Kelvin, and having other people vanish into the blurred background, only leaving their voices to be heard.These demons are becoming more real once he reaches Solaris on his investigation mission. One of the most memorable scenes for me was the first appearance of Rheya. Kelvin darting out of his bed, hitting his head, trying to wake up and finally understanding that this is real and not a dream. Sent shivers down my spine. And while Chris loses his grip on reality, Rheya becomes more real and more aware of herself and of the fact that her existence is something \"unreal\". At first Rheya is only talking in formulas, but as the film progresses, she develops a new personality and we see Rheya (Solaris) becoming more like Rheya (Earth) again. And there are the two other members of the crew, Dr. Gordon (v. Davis) and Snow (J. Davies). Snow is...- weird, and Davies' creepy characterisation was spot on, IMO. You'll understand *why* Snow acts this way later in the film. The only person choosing reality instead of dreams, and incidentally the only one to survive is Dr. Gordon. She also is the one that ultimately figures out a way to get rid of the apparitions and doesn't hesitate to do so.There is another member of the cast that merits mention and that is the score. In most films, the score is either utterly forgettable or tells you the story in broad strokes and with thumping drums. In this one, it felt like a fifth character, setting the mood for a scene, and freshening up the atmosphere with a little splash of notes here and there. It also kept you in a kind of... trance-like mood in parts, thereby adding another layer to the \"reality or dream?\" question that permeates the film.Soderbergh took Lem's classic science fiction story and made something entirely different from it, but still a classic sci-fi story, exploring love, reality, minds and sanity.",

            "content": "I just came back from \"Solaris\" and I really don't know what to think of it. I knew nothing about it beforehand, but I was expecting it to be a run-of-the-mill sci-fi film.  Well, \"Solaris\" is definitely not a typical sci-fi, which is good, but mostly bad.  It's a love it or hate it movie.  I love films that mess with your mind, but this was too much for me.  The total absence of action was fine with me, but people looking for thrills and chills will have to do with multiple butt shots of Clooney's posterior. \nOf all the movies I've seen in a theater, I've never been so emotionless before.  Not once did I close my eyes in fear, laugh, or express any other emotions.  All 20-some people in the theater were like zombies, or maybe they were just asleep.  When I left the theater, I felt like I'd just come out of a coma.  Watching this movie is more like watching a painting come to life, I don't know how else to say it.  The visuals are gorgeous and the acting was quite good, but the story is a mess.  Even the most intelligent moviegoers will probably walk out feeling stupid for not knowing what was going on.  Unlike other movies of this nature, seeing it multiple times probably won't help you understand it.The story begins right away and draws you in, but you probably won't have a clue what's going on until a half hour in.  By the end, I still didn't know much of the plot, but I didn't walk away completely empty.  It was a surreal experience that is somewhat rewarding, yet it was a total head trip.  George Clooney plays a psychologist or scientist (not clarified) that has been summoned to check out the strange phenomena happening in Solaris, a world in space.  He is soon greeted by his deceased wife and finds out the two remaining crew members also have \"visitors\" that are dead.  I'm going to stop there because if I go on, I'll blow the whole plot.  The plot is pretty thin, so the action moves at a snail's pace to make this short story into a 90-minute film.  If you can make it through this movie, you can make it through any movie.  On an artistic scale, I'd give it a 8/10, but entertainment-wise, I'll give it a 2.",

It's clear they spared no expense on the set, design, and effects, but all the beauty in the world can't replace a soul.A psychiatrist named Chirs Kelvin (George Clooney) gets an emergency summons to a space station orbiting a planet called Solaris. He doesn't get any information other than he's perfectly suited to handle the situation on the space station. When he arrives he sees a blood trail leading to a laboratory. He also sees two dead bodies in a freezer being used as a temporary morgue. The only two people alive on this vessel are Gordon (Viola Davis), Snow (Jeremy Davies), and a boy. Snow is a spaz and Gordon won't offer up much information.And that's as interesting as this movie would ever be.Kelvin slept and had a dream of meeting his wife and them being intimate, then he woke up beside her. His wife Rheya (Natascha McElhone) was a manifestation of his dreams, kind of like the 1998 movie \"Sphere,\" but less interesting and less suspenseful. What they did with this premise was just criminal. They dragged it into some philosophical mumbo jumbo about what's real or not, and what's dead or alive. \"Solaris\" just inched along relying on pretty people, a pretty set, and pretty music.

You're hoping it's a set-up to pull the rug out from under you when you least expect it.  Sadly, there is no rug; the rest of the movie remains at this underwater pace all the way to its unsatisfying and hokey ending.The premise is intriguing enough, but little is done with it.  Instead of focusing on the thriller (unraveling the mystery of Solaris), the back story of Clooney and his lost love takes over.  This is dull beyond belief--partly because we know it's history and partly because Clooney's lover is a character that is so moody, aloof and unsympathetic that we really don't care about her at all.  What should have been one flashback--or at most a montage--becomes almost half the film.  And the wrap-up of the main story ensues without answering any of the mysteries of Solaris.  We never know why it does what it does.  There's nothing to spoil, here, folks.  Because there are no surprises.Then, as if the content weren't dull enough, they add insult to injury by filming the thing like a student film on a shoestring budget with unending tight shots and close-ups...as though they couldn't afford any sets.  With the amount of money amassed by the talent involved, this is not just annoying--it's unacceptable.  If it was an attempt at an effective use of claustrophobia, it failed miserably.  As does the film.  We were sold a sci-fi thriller with big names at the helm.  What we got is a cheap, poorly conceived, dismally executed, plodding shaggy dog story that should be used to calm ulcer patients and nothing more.",

            "content": "Though many may prefer the 1972, three hour(or more) Russian version of Solaris, I must say that I thoroughly enjoyed this updated version of Stanislaw Lem's masterpiece sci-fi novel by the same title. Produced by James Cameron and written/directed by Steven Sodebergh, this version of Solaris is an intelligent, thoughtful and reflective movie, a triumph of the narrative and visual which co-exist in this case in a wonderful balance. Steven Sodebergh's script, though lean, does not ignore the the essence of the book, which is that this is a love story, a search for redemption, a second chance, one to undo passed wrongs and mistakes.I won't delve into the plot of the movie or the book, save to say, that many of us could identify with the plight of the principal character, doctor Chris Kelvin (George Clooney), a man beset by the demons of his past. The sorrow, regret and pain that he carries within himself is aptly disguised by a facade of melancholy and sadness. I was very impressed with George Clooney's performance. If I ever had any doubts about his range and talent as an actor, this movie truly put them to rest. While before I used to see him as just another pretty-boy-wannabe-TV-actor, after his turns in \"Three Kings\" \"Out of Sight\", \"Good Night and Good Luck\" and my favourite \"Syrianna\" and of course \"Solaris\", in my mind he has cemented his acting abilities and talent beyond a shadow of a doubt. George Clooney is bar none one of the best actors working today.The cinematography is beautiful, while the CGI/F/X are excellent, supporting the movie and its overall atmosphere and look, never being intrusive or taking over. \"Solaris\" is a fine example of what true sci-fi can be, and can thus join the pantheon of sci-fi classics as \"2001 A Space Odyssey\", \"Alien\", \"Blade Runner\", \"Gattaca\", \"Dark City\", \"Strange Days\" and others.Natasha McElhone (Rheya) is great (and beautiful) while the rest of the supporting cast is very good (Jeremy Davies is really weird...but in a good way).The soundtrack totally captures the atmosphere and mood of the movie, which is one of melancholy and sadness. Cliff Martinez is one of the most talented musicians in the business today. Steven Sodebergh's direction is great and as expected, of great quality.If you are a fan of grand, epic scale sci-fi opera like Star Wars (not to take anything away from Star Wars and its significance for sci-fi), or prefer action and a high body count a la Starship Troopers and Total Recall, then perhaps this movie is not for you. If you want a movie with a deeper meaning and more thoughtful structure, then \"Solaris\" is that movie. Its appeal lies in the fact that it goes beyond a movie specifically classified as science fiction. \"Solaris\" is one of the best movies out there!",

The drama and tension in Solaris are quiet and understated, and are mostly inherent in considering one man's decisions about what love, and loss, and the nature of life, mean to him. In this way, it's a very personal movie.In the end, we don't know much more about the characters than we did at the beginning, and this is a weakness of Solaris. It requires George Clooney's charisma and his visual attractiveness to rope the viewer in and keep the viewer involved, and to this extent whether the movie works for you or not depends to some extent on whether Clooney's magnetism can draw you in. And because we are given so little information about the characters in the movie, and learn so little about them, there are some moments where the viewer may not understand what's going on or why the characters are behaving the way they are. People who don't like those kinds of \"hey, wait a minute, what's going on here?\" moments will probably not enjoy the film.But if you're the kind of person who likes a movie that makes you think \"what if...\" and draws you to think about what you've seen in terms of your own life and experiences, this is a movie you could watch over and over and enjoy in a quiet, contemplative way. I liked it a lot because it got me thinking about things that are bigger than the world I inhabit, and I'm sure I could watch it again and again and enjoy it every time I watch it. At the same time, I know there are a lot of people who will find it boring, puzzling, and not something that works as pure entertainment. For this reason, I recommend it with some reservations.",

Soderbergh and Clooney have produced a literate, cerebral, adult film exploring the nature of consciousness, faith, reason, reality and love.In a career best performance, Clooney gives a deep and subtle portrayal of a man emotionally laid bare by the death and seeming resurrection of his wife played by Natascha McElhone.Soderbergh has deliberately gone for a gloomy, moody, restrained feel - think Seven with the rain but without the violence - and the lack of music to drive the plot along adds to the stark and brooding atmosphere. This is space as it probably really is - lonely, silent, exhilerating and foreboding.And talking of plot drivers, Soderbergh has obviously taken lessons from producer Jim Cameron on how to succinctly tell your story in what is little over an hour and a half, which makes a refreshing change from the usual two hour plus bloat-ware that usually takes up our screens.If there's one fly in this otherwise superbly made tonic, it's Jeremy Davies' tech/geek boy character. A cliched, hackneyed, attention- seeking performance of every over-mannered oddball that's ever been committed to celluloid.Make no mistake.

The most obvious difference is that this film is much shorter, cutting out most of the scenes prior to Kelvin's journey to the space station over the planet Solaris.Set in the future psychiatrist Chris Kelvin is asked to go to the Solaris space station where something odd is happening to the crew, when he gets there things are stranger than Kelvin could have imagined; the person who'd requested him to come there has killed himself but his son is there... a son who was never taken there from Earth. The two remaining crew members are behaving very strangely. That isn't the strangest thing though, as he sleeps he dreams of his wife and when he wakes up she is there in the room with him... despite the fact that she'd committed suicide many years before. At first he believes he must be hallucinating but when he realises that she is real begins to believe the others explanation that she is a creation of the planet below.The style of this film is very minimalist, if you like your science fiction full of giant robots or laser battles this might not be the thing for you although it you want something different; about ideas rather than action it is well worth watching. The actors did a good job and it was nice to see George Clooney in a film that was never going to be a blockbuster but who's presence will have brought in some viewers who wouldn't have thought of watching it otherwise.",

            "content": "\"For centuries, theologians have been explaining the unknowable in terms of the not-worth-knowing.\" - Henry MenckenStanislaw Lem wrote \"Solaris\" in 1961. A science-fiction classic, the novel watches as a psychologist, Doctor Kris Kelvin, travels to a research-station orbiting the ocean planet Solaris. Something on Solaris is revealed to be sentient. Whether the planet itself constitutes an alien being, or whether a planetary-scale being resides in Solaris' oceans, is unknown. Kelvin travels to his destination via a ship called the Prometheus, a name associated with civilisation and enlightenment in Greek mythology. Once the Prometheus arrives at Solaris, however, Kelvin finds its inhabitants lost in terror, madness and confusion. Some have killed themselves, others have sequestered themselves in their cabins. All have seen facsimiles of people they once knew on earth, each seemingly conjured to life by the alien creature below. Kelvin sees his long-dead wife. Lem is known for a number of \"pessimistic\" first contact novels. In \"Solaris\", his research station is populated by scientists who study the alien below using a scientific discipline known as Solaristics. They categorise, record and observe, but their mountains of data reveal no patterns and yield no insights. Rare for science fiction, Lem's alien thus remains resolutely \"alien\", impenetrable, inconversable and seemingly unknowable. Faced with epistemological limits, and a science which provides no answers, the researchers grow further insane. \"We don't want other worlds,\" they growl, recognising that no man desires anything truly alien, \"we want mirrors!\"As Lem's novel progresses, it becomes increasingly Kafkaesque. His humans become unhinged, disillusioned, at the mercy of forces that boggle the mind. Shockingly, they begin to doubt even their ability to understand human beings. \"How can we expect to communicate with the ocean,\" they moan, \"when we can't even understand one another?!\" It quickly becomes clear that Lem's alien is in fact experimenting upon his human characters. These experiments come from an omniscient being whose behaviour \"makes no sense\" and whose tests are inescapable. While it gathers data, mankind remains in the dark. While it pokes and prods, man's similar efforts yield nothing. And all the while, Solaris' oceans churn, man's anxieties and presuppositions reflected back up at him. Andrei Tarkovsky adapted \"Solaris\" in 1972. His film ejects most of Lem's science, skirts over Lem's interest in exobiology, and instead focuses on Kelvin's relationship with his \"reincarnated\" lover. It then climaxes with Kelvin accepting this facsimile as a fraud, but nevertheless making the decision to spend the rest of his life with it. The film's final sequence finds Kelvin travelling down to Solaris, and living on a simulated island with his simulated lover.Tarkovsky's film demonstrated a strong, anti-technology bias. It is filled with characters who bemoan machines and space-travel, all of which distract from some supposedly deeper \"spiritual\" and \"material\" reality. Tarkovsky then offers \"nostalgia\" (for love, life, flesh and earth) as a force which humanity cannot live without. Tarkovsky doesn't glorify \"nostalgia\" - his Earth is nevertheless one of decay, loneliness and inhospitable Russian winters \u2013 but he nevertheless presents it as something markedly better than the cold churches of science, which promise everything but deliver little. That this is a false binary doesn't occur to Tarkovsky.Tarkovsky, a complicated Christian, also manages to turn his adaptation into a darkly religious parable. His Kelvin takes a \"leap of faith\" and chooses to believe in a paradise on the surface of Solaris in which the deceased now roam free. All these changes, of course, infuriated Lem, who detested Tarkovsky's adaptation. \"He didn't make Solaris, he made 'Crime and Punishment',\" Lem fumed. \"The book was not dedicated to the erotic problems of people in outer space! I wanted to create a vision of a human encounter with something that cannot be reduced to human concepts, ideas or images! This is why the book was entitled 'Solaris' and not 'Love in Outer Space'!\"Elsewhere Lem would accuse Tarkovsky of misinterpreting his novel. For Lem, the facsimiles created by the aliens were, quote, \"exemplifications of certain concepts derived from Kant; the Unreachable, the Thing-in-Itself, the Other Side which cannot be penetrated! The whole sphere of cognitive and epistemological considerations was extremely important in my book and it was tightly coupled to the solaristic literature and to the essence of solaristics as such. But the film has been thoroughly robbed of those qualities!\" In short, Lem was upset that Tarkovsky's adaptation was not preoccupied with \"alienness\", but with what Lem called \"Kelvin's pangs of conscience\"; human characters who essentially use aliens to assuage past regrets.Steven Soderbergh adapted Lem's novel in 2002. Slick and brisk, the film replaces Lem's roiling oceans with a planet shrouded in what resemble flickering synapses and frayed nerve-endings. Like Tarkovsky, Soderbergh ignores Lem, and focuses primarily on Kelvin's nostalgic longings for his lost lover. Unike Tarkovsky, Soderbergh's aliens never rise above other cinematic creatures skilled at bringing human thoughts/memories to life (\"Forbidden Planet\", \"Sphere\" etc).Bizarrely, Soderbergh's adaptation has even more \"religious\" veins than Tarkovsky's. Soderbergh's Kelvin is an atheist who nevertheless adores Dylan Thomas' \"And Death Shall Have No Dominion\", a poem based on the New Testament. According to the poem, faithful men make it to the Kingdom of Heaven, faith in Christ assuring salvation. In Soderbergh's final act, Kelvin is himself called upon to make a choice: flee his exploding space station or remain behind and perish in the hope of being reunited with his lover. Kelvin remains faithful and is granted a meeting with an angelic kid. This kid touches Kelvin's hand, echoing Michaelangelo's \"The Creation of Adam\", at which point Kelvin is granted eternal \"afterlife\". Like Tarkovsky, Soderbergh thus delivers the opposite of Lem. For both directors, something alien and incomprehensible is confronted, which swiftly proceeds to quench Earthly longings, beliefs and Western spiritual traditions. Even in deep space, ET essentially gives the audience what it wants.7.9/10 \u2013 See \"World on a Wire\".",

Wait, I take it back, there was a great emotional story in the Russian film that is too distant by Tarkovsky's unique direction and the general Russian dramatic style for American audiences. Now it's clear why I asked the first question, Soderbergh's script is so sophomoric compared to the original that I couldn't see the point of the new production.\nDespite my general disappointment with this film, there are some very well done scenes between Clooney and McElhone and overall Clooney does a good job. However now that you've seen this version, make the effort and see the Russian original. It won't be easy because there are some very long stretches but it is a whole film.

The film is no different but even as a stand alone, Soderbergh's 'Solaris' fails to engage and appears pretentious at times. Moreover, promoting the movie with cheap publicity gimmicks, in this case, George Clooney's ass, only shows how little faith the makers had. Atmospheric science fiction has come a long way since (examples include Boyle's terrific 'Sunshine' and Douglas's superb 'Moon'). The atmosphere in 'Solaris' was intended to be cold and chilling but I did not derive any such feel. It just looked like the inside of an empty ship. In addition, the romance between Kelvin and his wife is hackneyed. George Clooney fails to convince in this one. The actor is generally good with subtle performances (example: 'Up In The Air'). However, he lacks spontaneity. Ditto for Natasha McElhone. Probably much of it has to do with the contrived romantic arch of the story. Viola Davis is excellent as the tormented astronaut. I can see why many people may have liked 'Solaris' but for me it's just another half-baked sci-fi flick that can easily be forgotten when compared to the likes of '2001: A Space Odyssey', 'Sunshine' and 'Moon'.",

Steven Soderbergh's remake shaves away half the running time and focuses more on the emotional aspects of the story, and as such is by far the better film. It's gorgeous to look at, bringing to life a beautiful view of space travel and existence, and full of the director's trademark stylish flourishes. Essentially, this is a two-hander between George Clooney and Natasha McElhone, two extremely handsome actors who are accomplished performers to boot. I couldn't think of a better cast.The film delivers an eerie atmosphere despite not a lot happening. It's definitely a mood piece. The romantic scenes between Clooney and McElhone feel authentic, and the many flashback scenes are pretty moving. This is a film that explores all the aspects of the human psyche: love, lust, withdrawal, madness, acceptance, suicidal tendencies, and more. Clooney is great, but McElhone is even better, playing a flawed and sometimes frightening woman. The sci-fi trappings are kept to a minimum, which is good, and the supporting cast members are also particularly fine \u2013 most notable is Jeremy Davies in a role just as kooky as the one he took in RESCUE DAWN. I liked this film, but I didn't find it particularly enjoyable. It goes on a journey of the human soul so to speak, but I wasn't left with much in the way of insight afterwards; I didn't feel that it had developed the characters very much. Still, it's worth a watch for fans of this stuff.",

It's like you're trained to fawn over a ten second shot of Clooney staring into space like a hurt puppy dog, because obviously there's something amazingly profound you're supposed to be pondering at that moment.  His wife's dead, he misses her, and his slipping memories of her are skewed and inaccurate, I get it, I don't need to watch slowly-edited shaky cam flashbacks ad nauseam to realize that. This guy is a psychologist, and a good one at that?  His occupation loses all meaning as soon as he sets foot in the space station.  He might as well have been a construction worker.

Thus, a cool idea for a science fiction film went down the gutter over a basic fundamental flaw. Does George Clooney have to have a love interest in every one of his films? While the idea of love certainly pushed the idea forward, it just felt like the middle of the film was too much timeless brooding between Clooney and Natascha McElhone. What was even worse, while the original was something in excess of five hours, this only felt like it, even though it was a rather elyptical 99 minutes. I never felt more bored and disgusted with a sci-fi film. This proved to be the worst film of this genre since Battlefield Earth, and that's a rather sad distinction. I think Soderbergh should stop trying to touch every spectrum of the film style rainbow and stick to a couple of stylistic approaches that best suit him.",

SOLARIS is, sadly, one of the latter, as James Cameron and Steven Soderbergh have turned a story of a higher redemption (ala 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY) into a long snoozefest. In an undefined future, psychiatrist George Clooney woodenly carries on his practice, despite grieving over his wife (Natascha McElhone), who recently committed suicide (not a good recommendation for any shrink!) The government calls him in, after the head of a deep-space exploration of a planetary anomaly called Solaris requests his assistance. The mission is going to pieces, but the crew refuses to return to Earth, so Clooney is sent in to find out why. Clooney arrives to find the leader (Ulrich Tukor) and another crewmember dead, and all but two other members missing. One of the survivors (Jeremy Davies) is truly 'spaced-out', doing a great pot-user imitation; the other (Viola Davis), is a paranoid basket case, locked in her cabin. Clooney also glimpses a small boy aboard, a child that should not be there. That night, Clooney has a restless night's sleep, dreaming of his dead wife...and the next morning, she is THERE, beside him, alive and cheerful. Being the analytical kind of guy he is, he decides he's NUTS, and launches the girl into space in a landing pod! Interviewing the survivors, he discovers that Solaris apparently is sentient, and creates loved ones under some kind of secret agenda. The child wandering the ship was the leader's son; the doper's brother had appeared, as had the paranoid crewmember's child. The doper asks Clooney, \"Would you like your wife back?\" \"Yes,\" Clooney admits, and, sure enough, after another night's sleep, she reappears, but no longer cheerful; she's now suicidal by nature...and despite Clooney's pleas, she ends up offing herself, again! Real happy-go-lucky stuff, here! Eventually, a variation of the mission's leader appears, and warns Clooney they would have to leave, or Solaris will absorb them. The paranoid woman is ready to go, but it turns out the doper is a Solaris creation; the real doper, as had everyone else, had died, their minds whacked out by the appearance of loved ones. Clooney, facing nothing but loneliness back on Earth, decides to remain, as well, and as the woman departs, the vessel is sucked into Solaris. As Clooney sits with the child in what remains of the spacecraft, his wife reappears, yet again, saying there is no life or death in Solaris, only redemption and peace...The End. It took me three viewings before I could stay awake through the entire film...and, honestly, the Nexus in STAR TREK:GENERATIONS was a FAR better 'benevolent space phenomena' than Solaris. This is the kind of film that can cure insomnia! George Clooney tries hard to provide some depth to the story, but a turkey is a turkey, is a turkey! Skip this one...",

Faultless cinematography is backed up by solid performances and an under stated script full of ambiguity that places the films riddles firmly in the viewers lap.Little things like life, death, love, redemption and indeed heaven and hell are all delved into with a depth seldom seen. Not so much a story as an experience (think 2001) this movie will take you far away from earth and into the depths of the human mind and space-time itself.Arguably a sci-fi film, deserving of Oscars and universal praise instead it has been swept under the carpet by the braindead masses who do not like to be challenged by their cinema.For people who like to come away from their movies with questions and don't enjoy things wrapped up in a bow.

He stares at her unbelievingly and asks, \"Am I alive or am I dead?\" \"We no longer have to think like that,\" she replies with a smile. \"We're together -- and we're happy.\" Well I would insist on knowing if I were alive or dead. Instead of ending with a big smooch, the movie would end with my whipping out a notebook and giving Natascha MacElhone a long interview aimed at finding out what the hell is going on.I never really could figure it out, but here's my best guess. Early in the movie we have a scene of Clooney, MacElhone, and some friends having an intellectual post-prandial discussion of evolution. \"Nothing special about us,\" argues Clooney, \"because it's all a matter of probability. We are a statistical inevitability.\" (MacElhone frowns. Maybe this is why she shortly commits suicide.) Okay. So Clooney believes in a mechanistic universe. And now -- remember that I'm guessing -- the movie sets out to prove him wrong. The universe is designed after all. And the planet Solaris, which Clooney and a few others are investigating -- is GOD. Yes, God.Actually this would be a kind of relief because it would end all the power struggles around whether God is a male or female figure. Since Solaris is a planet, it has no gender and can properly be called \"it,\" unless there is a lot about planets that we don't know yet.In the end, Solaris seems to absorb the space ship and everyone and everything on it. In other words, at the very end, when Clooney asks his formerly dead wife whether he is alive or dead, the answer is that he's dead. Specifically, he's gone to heaven to be reunited with his loved one.Now, I hope that's true. That our spirits (and maybe our bodies) go to a nice place called heaven, but this idea has been around for years and the movie raises all the old questions about heaven. Did Vlad the Impaler go to heaven too? Did Adolph Hitler? And what about my dog, Phoebus? And my cat, Oscar the Wild? My delicate delphinia?The movie seems like a long one. It goes on and on. Clooney reaches the space ship to find out what's happened to it. The two surviving crew members give him nothing but elliptical answers. \"You'll find out.\" Or, \"If I were you I'd just keep my door locked tonight.\" It turns out that the planet is reproducing figures of loved ones from the crew's memories of them as kind of an experiment. (I guess, but cf., \"The Martian Chronicles.\") The other crew already know this when Clooney gets there. Why didn't they just tell him? As it is he has to discover it for himself. The locked door doesn't help.Well, okay. So MacElhone is nothing more than a simulacrum of reality, although she doesn't know it. When this is made clear, she asks to be deconstructed because, after all, she doesn't exist anyway. But Clooney can't dispose of her even though she's not human. (Cf., \"Blade Runner.\") MacElhone is neat looking. She has high zygomatic arches, a bony nose and pointed chin, and enormous dark eyes. She's a knockout. And she's photographed splendidly. In fact the whole movie is photographically super-par. Clooney seems a likable guy, enough so that, even though I've heard him described as devastatingly handsome, I can forgive him for it. He has the everyman quality that Clark Gable or Spencer Tracey had. He'd be a good guy for a fourth at bridge and a couple of beers.The movie, though, whew, it's confusing and dreary. Not a single shot is taken outdoors in daylight. And the absorption of the space ship into Solaris seems patterned after a similar scene in \"2001\" but without the psychedelic whammies.It aims to provoke thought and I suppose it does that, but it is anything but emotionally gripping. We never get to know the other two crew members, one of whom seems nuts and the other downright hostile. And the relationship between Clooney and MacElhone is sketchy.It's worth seeing -- once.",

What is not completely predictable becomes completely irrelevant in the end. If this picture was made to try explore and/or question our existence and the possibility of a higher power, questions which this movie tries to raise on at least two occasions, in the end is moot. I found myself waiting for the movie to get to some point or at least go to a place to let the viewer in and start questioning one's self, but alas, no. It wades through thick self importance and then wraps up and you say, \u0091so what?' I never cared for any of these characters, that, like in 2001, are mostly distant and cold. But at least with 2001 there was HAL. That WAS the reason S.K. made the human characters so banal; to make HAL more alive by comparison. If that's what S.S. was trying to do here with the planet Solaris; he failed. At least with 2001 there were valid questions to be asked, possibly profound thoughts to be explored. Here the very lack of questioning and provoking thought is what's missing. What a let down. A huge budget, star(s), producer and director wasted on a motion picture that did even tantalize one little bit.\nDid anyone else notice that they even had the audacity to make the  planet look like HAL's optical lens when they did that pull away at the end?

            "content": "Solaris(2002) is a rare example of a remake being every bit as good as it's predecessor, and in some areas exceeding Tarkovsky's 1972 version. Solaris is adapted from Polish author Stanislaw Lems novel. The film centres around Chris Kelvin(George Clooney) a troubled psychologist sent to a distant research space station, orbiting a peculiar planet called Solaris. He's sent there to investigate strange occurrences going on with the crew, as they're experiencing possible delusions of people they loved who've passed away, coming back to life.Steven Soderbergh writes and directs this adaption, which helps give the film a singular vision. Where I feel this film improves upon Tarkovsky's version, is that it explores the emotional isolation and instability of the main character in more detail. Through the duration of the film, you see the toll it takes on Chris mentally and physically, in a way that i never got from the original film. Another aspect I really liked was the cold, strange detachedness that all the characters exhibited. The long pauses during mid conversation, the empty glances, all help to sell the eerie, uncanny atmosphere of the film, at some-points during the film it felt like it was directed by David Lynch.Something the screenplay also does that i found impressive, was that it gave the characters legitimate reasons for their actions. This is something rare in genre films, usually someone does something stupid or unrealistic to further the plot along. Here the characters motives are fully realised, and you can understand and even empathise the choices they make, even if they have negative consequences.Everybody in the film gives fantastic performances. George Clooney has never better. He gives genuine emotional intensity, especially in scenes with Natascha McElhone, who plays his on screen wife Rheya, that has somehow reincarnated aboard the space station. She gives a fantastic, unsettling performance of someone who's unsure of who they really are. Is she a living, breathing organism or a ghost living through someones memories. Jeremy Davies and Viola Davis round out the cast as two survivors aboard the station. They both give outstanding supporting performances, and their their opposing view points act as counter weights to Chris's emotional contradictions.At 1 hour 40 minutes the film is a whole hour shorter then the original film. Whilst this helps to streamline the pacing, it does end up losing some of the more deep philosophical depth Tarkovsky brought to the original. The original film also had better cinematography and set design, the space station felt generic and bland in this film. Where-as Tarkovsky's version was dirty, rundown and felt lived in. These are only a couple of minor gripes that I had with this film. Over-all Solaris(2002) met and exceed my expectations. Solaris is one of the best remakes around. It's a film that has it's own singular vision, that also adds upon the original, rather then just replicating it.",

Basically, if you don't already know the original, Dr. Chris Kelvin (George Clooney) goes into space boarding the station studying the ocean world of Solaris, after being asked to go by Gibarian (The Lives of Others' Ulrich Tukur). The main reason he is going is to investigate the unspecified phenomenon aboard because the original security team has gone missing, with Snow (Lost's Jeremy Davies) and Gordon (Doubt's Viola Davis) the only two survivors. They explain that Gibarian committed suicide, and they have been acting nervously since Chris arrived, and soon enough they were right to worry. Not long after arriving Chris is seeing two unexpected people aboard the space station, Gibarian's son Michael (Shane Skelton), and even more worrying his deceased wife Rheya (The Truman Show's Natascha McElhone). They had a good marriage before she committed suicide (I don't think it isn't really explained why), and of course it is exactly what Chris is experiencing that was brought to investigate. Snow and Gordon argue that Chris is having feelings for a memory only and that what he thinks is his wife with realistic feelings isn't human. Towards the end Chris questions whether he is going mad or whatever, and after something happens to Snow, Gordon almost convinces him to back to Earth with her, but instead Chris stays behind to stay with his \"wife\". Also starring American Pie's John Cho as DBA Emissary #1. The charm of Clooney is easy to see, McElhone is alright as the vision of his dead spouse, and the special effects are reasonable, but of course the must see original is much better, but not a bad romantic science-fiction drama. George Clooney was number 72 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 7 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols. Okay!",

On the other hand, I would never really buy anything out of a Sharper Image catalog. The visuals and sets are no less than stunning. The story - with its elements of love, loss, memories, and atonement - is a good one, though its execution suffers with some inconsistent points. Where Solaris falls flat is in its pacing and its acting. The movie presents itself as a thriller/experimental/sci-fi/romance/etc, but the pace never goes above a crawl. This sort of slow and atmospheric pacing works very well when done with style (Pi, for example, with its brooding intensity). In Solaris, it is mildly boring. The acting is cold and mechanical. Perhaps this is a statement on life in this future, perhaps not. In any case, it is very difficult to feel sympathy for any of the characters, as none of them are memorable enough to really get engaged in their lives or situations. Another very strange element to this film is its soundtrack. In the trailers, a sweeping and very cinematic score accompanies the actions onscreen. In the actual movie, the ambience is provided by an incessant steel drum and bell chorus. The same phrase plays throughout the entire movie. For the first hour or so, it emphasizes the isolation and repetition of a desperate situation; in the latter portion of the movie it becomes annoying. Cinematic scores are very stirring to provide emotional cues - they tell you exactly how to interpret the story. When done poorly, they seem intrusive. When done well, they subtly guide you along. If not done at all, it is a very rare movie that feels complete. Solaris is a bit difficult to review. After leaving the theater, I initially enjoyed it quite a bit. The more I thought about it, the less I liked it. See Solaris on the big screen only if you have the patience to invest time and thought in a cold and inaccessible film with some interesting ideas and great visuals.

In fact the movie, which has a darker vision and unlike the novel has an unhappy ending, is like a reply to 2001's vision. There is no rebirth but a lengthy kind of death because human beings carry the same pains and failings in space as they do on earth. Their weaknesses are no less relevant there. They will never be free of them and it's a simple fact of human nature.This American remake made 30 years later fails on nearly every level. It has the effects and acting but it's like a B movie with a big budget. I did try to like it but it doesnt capture the spirit of even Stanislaw Lem's novel or the Andrei Tarkovsky film.I suspect fans of Steven Soderbergh's movies are very easily entertained but fans of most remakes are too. Is it so hard to watch something made before you were born? I wasn't around in 1972 but I watched the Russian film. All three hours of it. If you want to watch The Godfather, watch that.

But while 2001 is the best sci-fi movie of all time, Solaris not even sci-fi. It distorts Stanislaw Lem's view of the universe and actually changes it around. Of course, many people think it's a work of genius by the way it throws philosophy around, but that's for those who like philosophy. I think philosophy is silly and overblown all around. Science (the daughter of Greek thinking - which I don't really consider philosophy in the modern, especially German, sense, but as a way to try to understand the universe) is the only form of thinking that's valid. So, I think that, although entertaining, both the 1972 Solaris and the book are rather silly in their opposite ways of considering the impossibility of humanity ever understanding the universe (which is obviously false by all accounts). That said, both are a zillion times better than this movie. Of course the decision of focusing on Kelvin's love life robs the film of all depth, but it goes beyond that. In trying to \"modernize\" the story by having Nasa selling the Solaris project to some corporation, you get the old and trite left-wing Hollywood trope of evil Capitalism trying to exploit nature as represented by Solaris. You don't get the actual core of the novel, which is the futile attempt of Solaristics to understand Solaris - and by extension the universe as a whole - but rather, as one of the Company (what a rip-off from Alien) agents say, \"the possibility of exploiting Solaris economically\". And the casting if abominable. Corey Feldman is, of course, the most ridiculous of them all, with his crazy gestures - and no, he doesn't use them here because his character is emotionally disturbed, he acts like that all the time, and I supposed he acts like that in real life too. But all the other actors are badly cast. Some have mentioned that Kelvin's wife - if forget her name now - is beautiful and renders a better performance that the others. But one of the key points of the book regarding her is her youth and innocence, in flagrant contrast to Kelvin, who is much older and cynical, which renders his shock at her return far more poignant. In that regard, Tarkowksy's casting is infinitely superior (also all the other points of this movie, silly as it is). In short, this is an awful movie. I tried to see it again today but found it almost unbearably embarrassing and boring. Stay away from it.",

Too much of the time it seems to be using the device of \"allegory\" as a shield for not understanding itself what it's saying.

I never saw her transformation from an unbelievably self-confident ice queen to a needy black hole to a suicide, there was no explanation given.  I never saw Clooney's transformation from a psychologist to an obsessed moron.  All of a sudden he's thrown his entire character away.  The film seems unconcerned with the idea that his real wife's bones are lying in planet earth and that he's dishonoring them by cavorting around with her doppelganger.  Also, I can't see any reason why Jeremy Davies character's visitor would be himself except for cheap plot twist value.  And if Clooney's friend's visitor, the little boy, stuck around after the guy died then were any of the security people around long enough to get visitors?  Oh, and why does Clooney's friend say that he doesn't know what's going on but they don't want it to stop if his son is still alive on Earth and he can just go back there to see him?  Why does no one simply ask Jeremy Davies where his visitor has gone off to?  Why do we receive no further information on the fate of the security team?  Or am I missing the point of how deep and profound this meditation on humanity was by asking for a little bit of logic and plot construction, demonstrable character transformation and maybe one warm color in the entire movie (but oh, that was thematic and profound because Solaris was the warm colors of red and purple, of course).  Oh, and if we wondered how we found Solaris or where it is in relation to Earth or anything like that we must be missing the point.  Good score, could have used a bit more of it to speed up the incredibly slow parts.  Funny thing is, as much as I never feel the need to see this film again, and definitely think it is the least significant of Soderbergh's films (and the most pretentious since the so-important and color-coded-so-dumb-people-can-understand-it Traffic), I would watch the +2 hour version I hear is floating around somewhere to see if they understand any more about it than they showed in this version. Just like I'm still waiting for a six hour cut of \"Thin Red Line\" and a six hour cut of \"Dune\" because the four and a half hour cut of it is still a triptik. Oh and NO MORE GEORGE CLOONEY BEHIND.  What was up with that?  His rump had its own key light!  In the end, you can't get past the fact that it isn't his wife, and there is no possible way he can actually believe it is his wife, and he's just a morbid obsessive who succumbed to an art-film version of Ren and Stimpy's \"Space Madness.\"  It felt as though the character and dialogue came from James Cameron while the sci-fi elements came from Soderbergh, which is hardly the preferable arrangement.  The way it turned out, the tagline should have been \"Solaris: Don't be fooled by your dead wife's ghost in space!\"  Seriously, rent \"Zardoz\" instead.",

They have physical structure and awareness, but only as far as the person remembers them.  Clooney's wife in real life committed suicide because she felt displaced and feared being left alone, so George tries to make amends with the alien life form taking her place.  If I could make sense of the muddled ending to the movie, I'd explain how things turn out, but the story falls apart and becomes incomprehensible. You get the sense that Solaris is supposed to be like Heaven or some form of afterlife, but it's not clear what the writers were thinking.Movies about aliens used to depict them as threats.  They were out to kill us, eat us, steal our women, take our planet away from us - basic caveman stuff.  But there seems to be a trend towards depicting alien life in a godlike manner - \"2001\", \"Contact\", \"Sphere\", etc. - like they're omnipotent benefactors out to help us earthlings.

Solaris takes 99 ponderous minutes to convey the same message. The movie is a sleep-inducing metaphysical meditation on the topic, loosely wrapped in a weak narrative, with weaker characters. I applaud George Clooney (the psychologist) for attempting to escape his romantic leading man stereotype, but he didn't have the chops for such an interior role. The script isn't kind to his undead/unreal wife, either, whose lines seem to come from a sophomore film school student. The spartan aesthetic \u0096 the sterile spaceship, the constant hum of electrical and ventilation systems, and wandering, new-age pulses of sound \u0096 sets a pensive mood, but there's not that much to think about after you realize, halfway through the movie, what the theme is.",

From the looks of it, it looked like Apollo 13, Armageddon, or The Core. Well, when I found out it was something different (by seeing the trailer), I was quite excited, even though I knew James Cameron and Steven Soderbergh were already in on the film. Then comes the huge disappointment.It was BORING. It was UNINTERESTING. It didn't catch any of my attention and the 92 minutes of the film's running time passed by surprisingly quickly. On a positive note, this is unlike any film you've ever seen. It was quite original for being a film that takes place in the future and it pays less attention to the future world than on the story, which I couldn't tell was good or bad.The look of the film is fantastic. Some CGI shots were subtle. The whole love story (which is used for the plot) was bad, in my opinion. I did not feel, whatsoever, that George Clooney and Natascha McElhone had any chemistry together, although their performances were great.Well, there are different perspectives on the film from different people. My perspective on it was boring and uninteresting but others might actually pay attention to the movie and love every bit of it. What also made this film boring is that the film's pace was SLOW. Still, I liked the ending.There are some good moments in the film but mainly many boring and dull moments which did not catch my attention. The performances and cinematography were good and subtle. If you like a small and quiet film, this might be the film for you. For the others, you might get bored.",

The sense of loneliness of the Solaris station, the bewilderment of it's crew and the strange things that happen there are presented by clean, steady pictures and narrated by one of the most original soundtracks I've ever heard. George Clooney gives a great performance so as Natascha McElhone, cast perfectly for the role of Rheya. Sometimes she has this extreme, edgy, almost hypnotic look and a penetrating glance that can send shivers down your spine. She's absolutely fascinating. Jeremy Davies also plays very well his role of Snow.'Solaris' is not perfect, but is well put together and does a good job of keeping you in a confused and shaken state.",

It is not really a Sci-Fi film, not really a drama, not really a physiological thriller but maybe a love story. I finally came up with a word to classify it, this is a bad film. A really bad film. Not the worst film in the world but it ranks right up there with the rank!I have read other reviews here comparing this film to Blade Runner or 2001: A Space Odyssey. If I were Ridley Scott I would be fuming and if I were Stanley Kubrick I would be spinning like a lathe in my grave. I will even cut Mr. Clooney a break and put the blame squarely on Steven Soderbergh. He fails on so many levels with this film. At least in the other films mentioned the characters are intelligent and think for themselves...they are to coin a term 3 dimensional. Clooney is sent to the space station that is observing Solaris as the only man who can save it. I take it they meant he was the best and brightest yet when his dead wive magically appears he does nothing to find out why, he just puts her in an escape pod and ejects her into space. The next night when she magically reappears with not a clue as to where an why she is there he totally accepts her without question. Clearly if he is earths best and brightest then nearly all people on earth go to school via the short yellow school bus. It makes you wonder how we developed the technology to make it into space at all, let alone another star system. The rest of the crew on the station are much worse but at least they have the excuse of having been there longer. It is hard to find a level this film does work on. The only redeeming quality are some of the scenes and the way they were shot. They made nice use of color to set the present and the memories apart, which is good because without that the viewer would have lost interest in the first 15 minutes of the film.If you want a film that makes you question reality then almost any Phillip K. Dick film will be a better bet or better yet read one of his books or short stories. If you are at the video store and this film and the Blade Runner directors cut are the only two videos in the store, just pick up Blade Runner. If you have seen Blade Runner 25 times already.....then pick it up again. I would be surprised it the film was hit by revisionist history and the credits listed the director as Alan Smithee and not Steven Soderbergh.",

(Albeit in a brightly lit spacecraft rather than a poorly lit apartment.) I don't need photon torpedoes blowing up aliens -- I would be willing to accept an enlightened conversation as \"something happening\", but we don't get that. By the time Gordon leaves for home, they know nothing about the phenomenon that she didn't know when Kelvin first set foot on the station. But thanks to his inept interviews (e.g. not asking follow-up questions to clarify obviously ambiguous answers), it takes him days to get up to speed. Toss out all of the time he wastes on that, and the flashbacks to very standard scenes from marriage to a depression-prone partner, and you are left with a typical Twilight Zone episode.",

Actually, the question should be why would anyone in his or her right mind throw away hard-earned, fiat currency to make a total train wreck of a flick?  Hmmm . . . can you say \"Solaris?\"  Do I sound redundant? If I do, please allow me to stop so I can start over and repeat myself. My husband fell asleep within the first 15 minutes of the movie, and I wondered if I shouldn't join him, seeing that even the lead actor, George Clooney (Chris Kelvin), kept falling asleep so his deceased wife (Rhyea) would return to him.  I should have fallen asleep so this movie would go away sooner.  But I resisted, and instead lapsed into a self-induced comma (aka: images floating before my eyes, while unable to generate any body movement, with occasional involuntary drooling and bodily excretions). So here you have Clooney, playing the role of a psychiatrist, who never really does any psychiatric work.  (I've seen more convincing performances in a Mandy Moore film.  She's more believable as a dying teen than Clooney is as a psychiatrist . . . and that's pushing the envelope - clean off the table.) Clooney shoots off into space to aid the commander of a floating space station, only the commander committed suicide before his arrival, but keep in mind a few years earlier Clooney's wife committed suicide, so it seems there might be a pattern emerging here, but noooo.  Instead, the remaining two people on the space station (upon Clooney's arrival) are able to dream up people - dead or undead who cares - because you never really know if they are dead or undead or if anyone is really what they seem.  Are they real or Memorex via the Solaris experience?  Only you never see their dreamed creation - well - except for the one fellow who dreamed up himself and then murdered his real self.  Or the space station commander's dream son, who is not really his son, who is actually back on Earth, but the dream boy doesn't do anything to make his character believable, which could have added an interesting story line to the movie to make up for all the dead, slow-paced script that fell flat from the first frame. The movie's core lies with Clooney's deceased, yet, unstable wife, who is even more unstable as a Solaris entity, and Clooney's dilemma is trying to keep her from committing suicide again, because she doesn't think she's the real Rhyea.  But no one bothers to indulge the viewer on the true reasons behind her original instability, which makes no sense since her husband is a psychiatrist, but it is hinted that her mother was \"Certifiable.\" Instead of returning to Earth, Clooney elects to remain onboard the space station as it is sucked into the Solaris field.  So does he die, commit suicide or return as a non-acting actor in the last frames, as Rhyea re-enters spouting some voodoo propaganda to mess with the mind of the masses about being \"forgiven\" or some such nonsense?  Who knows, and by this time, who really cares? The title should be changed to \"Soborus.\"  Just wake me up when the credits role, please. zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz . . .",

Good-looking picture with wonderful art direction, fluid pacing and precise editing in the dream sequences; however, the main character isn't very intriguing, and nearly all the performances are underwhelming. As a member of the paranoid surviving crew, twitchy Jeremy Davies is used as comic relief. Though the picture could certainly use some levity, Davies nearly sinks the movie with his low-key hipster ranting, annoying gum-chewing and distracting tics (also the fault of Soderbergh, who allows Davies too much screen-time to go into his pothead arias). I don't think Clooney is ever in character here; he seems overly conscious of the camera, working his handsomeness--his externals--tenderly as a way to connect with the audience. It doesn't substitute for a gripping characterization and, by the end, most viewers will feel indifferent to the romantic plot twist. ** from ****",

I really wanted to see an expansion of the ideas and concepts presented in the original Russian Solyaris. I also wanted more action, more special effects and I wanted to see the people from the space station fly down to the planet and explore the alien sea.\nBasically speaking, I was disappointed that Solaris was a very perfunctory remake yet it managed to exclude all the intellectualisms which made Solyaris fascinating and compelling. I think a lot of film makers today need to work harder at creating stories and telling them effectively. I also believe there's too much reliance on the use of existing material as a basis for new films and this results in the creation of re-warmed, soulless products.Much of the acting left me cold. I thought Clooney was terribly wooden and spoke his lines at an excruciatingly slow pace while Jeremy Davies' \u0091quirky' character was extremely annoying. Natascha McElhone however was very good. Her portrayal of a fragile personality was genuinely haunting.The biggest problem with Solaris in my opinion is that although it does make an attempt to emulate and explore many of the intellectualisms presented in Solyaris, these intellectualisms don't translate into the Hollywood version. I believe the film makers should have realised that a Westernised version of Solyaris needed to be entirely different from the original in order to be successful. Of course a director like Kubric (God rest his soul), should have been able to pull off a new version of Solyaris effortlessly.As a general interest note, I was one of only two people in the cinema when I viewed Solaris. I felt like a VIP at a private screening \u0085 Although after 30 minutes, I wished I wasn't at the private screening. 5/10.",

The cinematography looks really good, the acting is pretty good, the soundtrack is the best element (composed by Cliff Martinez), but the film just doesn't work.

The second element wrong with this film is that you're not surprised by anything. In a film like this you almost need a reward for spending 100 minutes watching it, but you aren't given one, there doesn't feel like any form of redemption in this film for the viewer. If you want to watch a really good film by this director then look up \"the limey\" which is a very good film which, like solaris, deals with elements of love and how we deal with it when it has gone. In the case of the Limey it is between a father and daughter rather than a husband and wife. There hasn't been a film that has wound me up like solaris has in a very long time and to put the boot in even more, I got more satisfaction watching American Pie presents Band Camp, and that film is one of the worst films i have ever seen!",

Thank your lucky stars that someone made an attempt to bring the novel of Stanislaw Lem to the big screen without all the esoteric Tarkovskian fluff like closeups of men's earlobes. This (2002) version takes us back to the literary basics of good storytelling, and it did an admirable job. It patched up the loopholes and \"wtf moments\" that Tarkovksy left in his impressionistic 1972 version, and it introduced some fantastic--and I mean FANTASTIC--character twists and plot twists that were not just some schlocky Hollywood gimmicks for a change.I think you'll really enjoy this. Don't expect action. Don't expect scifi. This is a powerful psychological drama, and the most memorable scenes for me don't involve spaceships or life/death situations but rather, they involve the complex and frightening workings of a man's tormented, guilt-ridden conscience.Great performances by George Clooney, Natascha McElhone (most haunting eyes ever) and especially by Jeremy Davies who plays a minor but unforgettable character.

It's a pretentious 'style over substance' attempt to be meaningful with a story that's hard to comprehend and a script that's largely incoherent and with few sentences of more than 5 or 6 words.Some have compared this with another pretentious piece of nonsense, '2001 : A Space Odyssey' and found it wanting, which says it all. For me, Kubrick's film was beautiful but horribly lacking in real content; Solaris has neither beauty nor content and the science fiction aspect is entirely unnecessary as the love story at the centre of the film could have been set anywhere. While Kubrick had the benefit of the menacing Hal, Soderbergh has nothing; there is nothing in this film to grab hold of. People who must be presumed to be highly intelligent and rational, lose their rationality when confronted by situations which simply cannot be true.This is obviously someone's idea of great and meaningful film making, but it certainly isn't mine. It jumps around in time and place which only serves to make it even more confusing to follow. The cast are wooden in the extreme, exhibiting no real emotion and, frankly, looking as bored as I was after the first 30 minutes or so. They, of course, were being paid big bucks so got a reward for their time; I was not being paid and simply got bored. Nonetheless, I persevered to the end - more fool me.2 out of 10 at best.",

This mood gave rise to a genre of thoughtfully speculative science fiction films, a world away from the explosive blockbusters of today. Stanely Kubrick's '2001: A Space Oddesey' is of course the prime example of this genre, but Andrei Tarkovsky's 'Solyaris' is widely regarded as its Russian equivalent, and has now been re-made by Stephen Soderbergh. Soderbegh has a liking for telling stories achronologically (a preference in evidence again here), and to my mind, his films often favour style over substance. And this is certainly a stylised film, all silence and shadows. The good news is that there is an interesting idea at the movie's heart, but the pace is slow, and I found all the characters annoying: George Clooney's is woodenly sympathetic, Natasha McEllhone's is radiantly feline but never wholly real (though this is intentional); Jeremy Davis plays an annoying American weirdo and Viola Davis's character is simply tough and hard. Apparently, the original (which I haven't seen) was even longer and less coherent; this version is distinctive, but it's a hard film to warm to. Behind the futuristic setting, it's essentially a love story; but I've never seen a Soderbergh film with a real emotional core, and this one doesn't break that mould.",

Why tell us, for example, the fate of the real wife so early on, only to then flashback at the end of act two to George Clooney finding her in bed--something we have already been told happened--when that could have been a fantastic reveal?The film keeps saying things, all kinds of things, like \"we can't trust our memories,\" blah blah blah...but these statements never find any real means of expression.  They are never dramatically illustrated in the events aboard the station, or in the juxtaposition of those events with the flashbacks.

He is sent to the space station Prometheus to investigate the loss of contact with the Solaris mission after receiving a plea from Commander Gibarian (Ulrich Tukur), a Prometheus astronaut. When he arrives he finds that Gibarian has committed suicide, Dr. Helen Gordon (Viola Davis) has barricaded herself in her room, and scientist Snow (Jeremy Davis) is barely comprehensible in his attempts to explain what is taking place. Kelvin quickly learns that Solaris is not just an inert planet but a sentient being (perhaps a metaphor for Heaven) that creates exact replicas of people from the crew's past including Gibarian's young son and Kelvin's wife Rheya (Natasha McElhone).\nIncreasingly drawn to the double of his wife, Kelvin is forced to complete the past and take responsibility for her suicide. Enhanced by a lovely score by Cliff Martinez, Soderbergh's is a moody and deeply spiritual version that pares the story down to its essence. As told in numerous flashbacks, much of the film is taken up with Kelvin's memories. In one crucial scene at a dinner party, while Rheya defends the idea of a higher intelligence, Kelvin plays the role of a coldly rational scientist and scoffs at her ideas. Ultimately, with the guidance of the intelligent ocean of Solaris, Kelvin is provided a second chance to confront his demons. Allowed to take responsibility for his past, he is able to embrace the spiritual harmony of the universe. While perhaps less poetic than the Tarkovsky version, it's theme of the pain of love and memory are deeply moving and the film resonates with a quiet beauty all its own.",

The one who watched it in a theater; with the loss of their money, and the failure to runaway?, or the one who watched it through TV or cable; with all the commercials which would make it longer and longer?!_For all the makers of this (Solaris): OH MY GOD, this is horrible to watch. This is not a philosophical film with deep meanings and thoughts. And for sure not a genre movie with entertaining sci-fi or even romance. Rather, it's the allegation, the naivety, or maybe the arrogance. And remember well; the worst kind of idiocy is the one that thinks itself genius!_For Steven Soderbergh as the scriptwriter: What were you thinking?! There isn't absolutely anything to talk about. All what I felt were barren fabrication, and a desire to make something different yet done by conceited logic. So whatever the fine meaning intended out of remaking the Russian film; this American remake ended up as so vain film, with no fine meaning, or meaning in the first place!_For me: I'm sorry for putting my trust in the wrong persons, forgetting the fact that every artist had their own flops, and the other fact about most of the production of Hollywood at the 2000s as insolvent!_For George Clooney and Natascha McElhone: Nothing to say except that there was no chemistry between you two, being a ridiculous couple in such a cold-to-death film._For the ones who love the conspiracy theory: Maybe Soderbergh and Clooney did it only to force the production company to terminate their contract. Yes, it's that awful to make me think so. And as funny as it may seem; it had been done before!_For all the lovers of THIS (Solaris): Not every film unlike the usual nonsense that you watch from the American cinema yearly MUST BE GREAT or even GOOD.

            "content": "It's amazing how many reviewers don't know what this movie is based on and why it was made. They think this movie is based on Stanislaw Lem's book, so they compare it to the book and think they did a good job. Let me give you a bit of history instead.It's the end of 1960s/beginning of 1970s. Stanislaw Lem and Andrei Tarkovsky discuss the future movie adaptation of Lem's book \"Solaris\" in Moscow. They spent 6 weeks over there and Lem was so angry that he called Tarkovsky \"a fool\" and left Moscow. Lem later said in an interview that Tarkovsky completely missed the idea of \"Solaris\" book, and instead wanted to make something similar to Dostoyevsky's \"Crime and Punishment\". So Tarkovsky made a movie \"Solaris\" in 1972 which focuses on the tragic love story but skips most of Sci-Fi ideas from Lem's book.Lem hated Tarkovsky's movie and openly admitted it, but nevertheless Tarkovky's movie became a cult classic, a separate masterpiece. It became popular all over the world. Many people didn't read the book but saw the movie and were impressed by it. The problem was though that Tarkovsky's 1972 movie was 3 hours long. By 2000s it also looked very outdated (the scenes of futuristic city were in fact simple street shots of 1970s Tokyo). That's why Hollywood decided on the movie remake. And Soderbergh made it with Clooney and McElhone in 2002.Therefore 2002 Solaris is a remake of the 1972 Russian Sci-Fi classic (which is clearly stated in the description). Don't compare it to the book, watch the 1972 movie and compare them instead. Many reviewers rightly pointed out that the movie captures only a small part of the book, but they didn't see Tarkovsky's movie at all.Now was this Soderbergh's remake better or worse than 1972 Tarkovky's movie? It's a matter of personal preference. 1972 movie was always my favorite, and I am obviously prejudiced. Still I think Soderbergh's remake captured the mood of Tarkovsky's movie and the love story was fine. Many people said that Clooney's character was emotionless but so was Donatas Banionis in 1972 movie. Chris (the character) was a man whose scientific background always contradicted with his emotions, his guilt and his love to his wife. I think that Natasha Bondarchuk (Khari) in 1972 movie gave a stronger performance than Natasha McElhone (Rheya) in 2002 movie (funny that both actresses are called Natasha). IMHO, supporting characters Snow (Snaut in the book) and Gordon (Sartorius in the book) were ok in both movies. Still, Russian movie is longer, has more characters and captures more details of Lem's book that Hollywood's movie.For some reason they changed character names in 2002 movie. 1972 movie had the names from the book, but in 2002 movie Kris became Chris. Khari became Rheya. Snout became Snow and Sartorius became Gordon. The only name they left unchanged was Gibarian (or Gibaryan).So my humble advice would be: enjoy both movies and the book separately, as different stories. That's how they were meant to be.",

Sounds like a disaster waiting to happen. Let me tell you now, it is not. If you have the ability to let yourself go into a movie, this picture is no less than fantastic. Absolutely fantastic. But if you're of those who cannot overlook the fact that a romantic story is involved, and is determined this will corrupt any great movie; you will not enjoy this movie to its fullest.Steven Soderbergh has done something beautiful here. He has created something we would like to be true, or at least dream of it as an option. Yes, in some manners it does remind me of Kubricks 2001, but where is the harm in that? 2001 was, and still is, one of the greatest movies ever made. I think Soderbergh knew that just like we know that. And I also don't think Soderberghs intention was to copy or duplicate 2001 in any way. I see it more as a tribute to one of the finest filmmakers to ever set foot on this planet.I will not tell the plot (which surely is spoiled among one of the other comments), neither will I criticize the acting, directing or any other aspect of this film. This is simply because I think these aspects (though not flawless) are unimportant if you are able to watch a film and simply let someone tell you a story without looking at it with the judgemental eye of a filmcritic. One has to be able to look at movies and distance oneself from that point of view sometimes. If you do that, this movie takes you to another dimension. It shows you a tale of dreams, human instinct, fear and passion.In my humble opinion I think this movie is worthy of perhaps an Oscar. In which category I don't know, but I feel it deserves to be recognized in some way. The movie took me away from something ordinary, into something extraordinary. If only for one and a half hour, I was in another place. This one is for those who have been asking for some quality to come out of hollywood. The question now is, will You recognize it..",

That's because there's nothing to understand. It's a real excuse for sci-fi, and is really a supernatural love story set on a spaceship. The only problem with it is that to make a love story work you need to empathise with the characters and care about what happens to them.

            "content": "Director Stephen Soderbergh seems pretty confident that no-one who sees this film has actually seen the original version, made by Andrej Tarkovsky in the early '70's. Not only is the plot line unaltered (both are reasonably faithful to Stanislaw Lem's short novel), but the style is the same - very slow, drawn out, very quiet (for the most part). Cliff Martinez's music score sounds like a clumsy pastiche of Ligeti's \"Atmospheres\" (the original used a sparse, electronic score by Eduard Artimyev and bit of Bach organ music). Whereas Tarkovsy's version, which renders the plot slightly more opaque than in the original novel,has a haunting quality, Sonderbergh's attempt is merely boring. George Clooney makes an adequate Chris Kelvin, but his performance lacks the brooding quality of Tarkovsky's Donatas Banionis. Natascha McElhone is decorative as Rhea, but not a patch on Natalya Bondarchuk in the earlier version. Jeremy Davis is a suitably gibbering Dr. Snow, but his neurotic performance must give place to the superb Yuri Yarvet, a distinguished Russian Shakespearean actor in Tarkovsky's version. For some reason, Lem's Dr. Sartorius has undergone a sex change and is here the female Dr. Gordon, dutifully played by Viola Davis. The change makes no difference at all either way. The overall effect of he earlier version is hypnotic and tantalising, the overall effect of this effort is pretentiousness with a big budget. In my DVD version, the various extra documentary features make no reference at all to the earlier Tarkovsky film. Just how dumb and ignorant does Hollywood think we cinemagoers are? Give me Tarkovsky any day!",

            "review_title": "Soderbergh's Solaris",
            "content": "Steven Soderbergh is the second great director to film an adaptation of the highly acclaimed novel by Stanislaw Lem. The late great Soviet director Andrei Tarkovsky made the first version of the film in 1972. This version is written, directed, photographed, and edited by the rising star Steven Soderbergh. Astute observers of cinema will recognize Soderbergh as the director who had two films nominated for best picture in the same year (Erin Brockovich and Traffic). From the previews one might expect a sci-fi space film in the tradition of 2001: A Space Odyssey. This film is actually better seen as a film about the landscape of the mind that happens to be set in outer space. George Clooney plays a psychiatrist and widower who attempts to deal with his grief by burying himself in his work. He is called away from his routine when he is asked to investigate a crisis in outer space. Two astronauts have died, and the survivors have sent back messages that are mysterious and a little scary. The psychiatrist is dispatched to solve the mystery and fix the crisis.Here he encounters an astronaut known as Snow, a delightful character full of quirks and tics. It took me a while to place the actor, but I finally recognized him as Jeremy Davies, the actor who played Corporal Upham in Saving Private Ryan. Davies gives one of the great supporting performances in the film, but the real sizzle in the acting department comes from Clooney and Natascha McElhone, the actress who plays Clooney's dead wife.Playing a dead wife might not seem especially challenging but therein lies the rub. When Clooney awakens after his first night on the spaceship, he discovers a live version of his wife in bed right next to him. Clooney soon discovers that the two surviving astronauts in the spaceship have had similar experiences. People go to bed and wake to find people that they have lost and long to see, next to them in bed.What we have told to this point could almost be gleaned from the previews. To tell more of the plot is to spoil the suspense that is an important part of the experience. If the viewer choosing this film is looking for an extraterrestrial shoot-em'-up he or she will be sorely disappointed. As a love story and psychological thriller, Solaris works quite well and Soderbergh solidifies his status as one of the great directors working in film.",

The atmosphere of the movie can be described as strange and dreamlike, much because of the story being partially told through flashbacks. I can't stress enough how much I adore the chemistry between our main character Dr. Chris Kelvin (played by George Clooney) and Rheya (played by Natascha McElhone). Their relationship is front and center which makes the dive into Kelvin's mind and struggle to understand what's happening so much more engaging. The planet of Solaris takes a backseat and is not the main conflict of interest, instead it shimmers in the background as an unexplained mystery that makes it appear as alien as something can be.Having not read the novel, I can understand if some people are disappointed in this movie's lack of explanation towards Solaris itself. However, even if you've read the book I think there is enough emotional resonance in this film to appreciate the story being told. After all, it's a tale about how we as humans cope with life, love and death and why it's so hard for us to accept the loss of those things.",

It lasted forever, it made no sense to me, and it was incredibly dull. Quite frankly, this movie is unwatchable. I have never seen a film creep along at a slower pace. For every 30 seconds of actual dialouge or action, we are forced to sit through 10 minutes of close ups on George Clooney's face, and views of stars out in space. This makes the plot incredibly difficult to understand because by the time you are done staring at the 10 minute closeup of George Clooney laying down on a bed, your mind has wondered and you can't really remember what is going on. I spent most of my time watching other people in the theatre. When the show started the place was nearly full, by the end of the movie almost half the viewers had walked out. Unfortunatly I was not one of them, although the thought had occured to me over and over again. When Solaris finally ended everyone stood up in unison and began piling out as quickly as possible. Bottomline, unless you are a raging insomniac who is in dire need of sleep, there is absolutely no reason to see this movie. Save your self the $7 and just sit at home and watch the paint dry on the walls.",

It is thought provoking only to those who will put forth the effort of seeing the questions in this movie for what they are. It's a philosophical and emotional journey rather than an explosion filled action thriller. It is fantastically atmospheric and eerie, which is very fitting considering the subject matter.The movie puts forth a few questions to the viewer: What does it mean to be alive? Where did we come from? Who are we? And what makes us who we are? This is one of the most well directed films I've seen. It's rather surreal in feel and surprisingly doesn't have a lot of science throughout. It's like a long relaxing dream. I don't understand why it only has around a 6 on IMDb. The direction was great, the philosophy is thought provoking, and the movie itself is just very well done. I especially enjoyed the music therein, as it went from very relaxing to eerie and back again at certain points.The acting is also just perfect. I was very surprised how deep of a character Clooney was able to pull off. You can really feel his character's emotions and understand him.I actually wish the movie was a little bit longer, only to extend the atmosphere a little more. At an hour and thirty-two minutes it still feels too short. Yet, I think when a movie feels like it should have more length it is a very good sign, as it means I wanted to experience it a little bit longer.I think people that don't like this movie are just the kind of people that don't like to think about movies. The same people that don't enjoy movies like The Fountain. Maybe they expect all science fiction movies to be The Matrix, I don't know, but this is a wonderfully well done piece of science fiction that I think deserves a lot more credit than it receives. So, if you're not looking to have a movie shoved down your throat, and if you're looking for a strange, yet beautiful piece of art, I'd say this is one of your best bets.One last thing, I recommend that people see this twice, as I didn't understand a lot of it the first time through, so I missed a great deal of the philosophy beneath the surface. I also didn't understand the ending the first time I watched it, but I now understand it perfectly.",

Eventually, the previews told me I should give this a chance (with movies like 8 Crazy Nights and Treasure Planet, my options were slim).

Clooney proves that he can stretch his acting range as a pyschologist dealing with the death of his wife, which he blames himself for (she committed suicide.) Imagine arriving to a ship and going to sleep, only to wake up with your wife who has been dead for years. Weird, eh? This movie does get REALLY slow at times, which in part is necessary for tension, but at times it draaaaaaaaaaaags. If you're not a fan of non-action sci-fi movies, then skip this. This is a movie that makes you think, but the violence level is zero. No action, unless you count sex. The performances are strong by the supporting cast. The ending is weird as well. You WILL have to watch this more then once to appreciate it. I'll appreciate it again when it comes to DVD next year.Final Score: 6.4 out of 10 (A decent sci-fi flick that relies more on thought then action.

Clooney ends up being no help to them as he too is sucked into the mysterious environment and starts seeing visions of his dead wife (Natascha McElhone).

The original was a strange, very demanding movie, and the remake is no different, only much shorter. This is not a sci-fi film for the people who think \"Independence Day\" is a sci-fi film.The year is not given, but it is clear that the story takes place sometime in a pretty distant future. Something strange has happened aboard a space station orbiting a glowing ocean planet called Solaris. Before the crew cut off contact, they were exhibiting bizarre, seemingly paranoid behavior. Chris Kelvin (George Clooney) is summoned to go to the space station and find out what happened, and upon arrival he finds a trail of blood and two of the crew members dead.In a more ordinary film, this is probably where slimy, fanged aliens would start jumping out of the shadows, but this is not that kind of movie.Apparently, the planet of Solaris is conscious. It responds to tests as if it knows it is being observed. Most disturbingly, it has the power to reach into your subconscious and replicate any person, living or dead, from your life and put them right there on the space station. This is what Kelvin finds out when he wakes up next to his wife, Ryeah (Natascha McElhone), who killed herself years ago, but is now here, seemingly in flesh and blood. What is she? Is she human or alien? The catch is that she doesn't know, either. She exhibits emotion, believes she is Ryeah and doesn't remember dying. This obviously is a moral dilemma, as she is clearly not \"real\", yet is a conscious, emotional being who is seemingly the same person as his dead wife.\"Solaris\" gets even much more complicated than that, as it inter-cuts scenes of Chris and Ryeah's tragic relationship on Earth with all the confusion aboard the space station, with the ever-present glowing ocean of Solaris seeming to silently observe them the whole time, like rats in a moral maze.The movie is undeniably slow-moving and strange, and a lot of people will not like it. Some people enjoy watching movies like this that force you to examine the very nature of humanity, and some don't. If you don't like movies like that, then you will not have a good time.But for a patient and open-minded movie fan, \"Solaris\" is riveting, powerful stuff.",

It abandons aliens, pyrotechnics and spectacle for a much more mysterious, soulful and ponderous approach, and at times seems like an impressionistic painting or a symphony set in the havens of space. It uses the ultimate vastness of space to ironically focus inward to the soul, and attempts to tackle some really difficult questions of identity, the origins of emotion, and the composition of a psyche and how others perceive it. George Clooney strips away his charm and suave antics for an emotionally raw, staggering portrayal of a broken man named Chris Kelvin, who finds himself spiritually and emotionally challenged beyond anything he has known, and the guy is a psychiatrist. After a brief, ambient prologue set on earth, Clooney is beckoned by an ambiguous message from his friend (Ulrich Tukur), urging him to journey to the distant planet Solaris, where strange phenomena is plaguing the members of a research vessel in the planet's orbit. Curiosity prevails and he makes the trip. Things get strange when he realizes the ship is in desolate disarray, and the crew members are disturbed by the arrival of 'visitors', replicas of deceased loved ones that appear out of nowhere. Chris's visitor is his deceased wife Rheya (Natasha Mcelhone), who has little memory or cohesion, and no answers for him. What does Solaris want? Why has it chosen to bring these lost loves back to the crew? Is it curious? Malevolent? Soderbergh's version of the book by Stanislaw Lem is the better version in my opinion. There is deep, deep contemplation at work here, that affects you on another level. The nature of a soul, in its complete form, as opposed to the image we reflect unto others with our actions, resulting in a version of ourselves held onto by our loved ones, incomplete and altered by their subjective perceptions. These intriguing themes are explored by the two leads with stunning depth and compassion. Clooney paints a vivid portrait of heartbreak and haunted memories. The underrated Mcelhone is angelic as both the visitor version, confused, emotionally stunted, and as Rheya herself in flashbacks, flawed, loving and scared of life's possibility. Visuals of the planet itself watch over the unfolding revelations, painted in deep gorgeous purples, sonic blues and ethereal, scintillating swaths of cosmic red. The look and design of the ship is built on practicality, and humble, muted colours. One of the key factors in the films atmosphere is the genius score by Cliff Martinez. It's a spacey, moody electronic jangle that hovers on the fringes of our awareness like galactic, auditory lace, and puts out a beautiful musical carpet of stars for the characters to wander and wonder in. The supporting cast is wonderful too. Tukur strikes a noble chord and nails his scenes. Twitchy Jeremy Davies gives his trademark weirdness. Viola Davis is dynamite, her terrified astronaut delving into scary primal places. Soderbergh gives his usual polished, mature approach to the visual aspect and direction. Sci fi films this ambitious, beautiful, deep and affecting all in one package are all too rare, but I constantly find myself wanting to revisit it's poetic, emotional grandeur and intimate, heartbreaking performances again and again.",

Clooney was excellent as the troubled psychologist dealing with the suicide of his wife. He is summoned to the Prometheus, a space station orbiting the moon of Solaris. The message is vague, but tells him that \"strange things have happened, and the easiest thing would be to return home, but (they) don't want to\". So he goes to help out.............It was captivating.

Who unexpected committed suicide, after an argument they had. When his friend (Ulrich Tukur) sends him a video message from an space station. He asked his friend to join him an mission in a space station \"Solaris\" for help him studying an unusual phenomena that happened. Once he arrived, some of the crew died mysterious including his friend. Only two remaining scientist (Viola Davis and Jemery Davies) are still alive. When Chris tries to convinced them to return to earth with him. Chris finds himself interacting with his dead wife. Which the crew are seeing people from their lives. For those, who's still alive on earth or not. This strange phenomena is coming from the \"Solaris\", they are studying and these \"people\" think, they are real. Which it's been created by the \"Solaris\". The psychologist and the scientist are trying to find an reason, why they are re-created from their mind and trying to find the secret of what \"Solaris\" holds.Directed by Oscar-Winner:Steven Soderbergh (Ocean's Eleven \"2001\", Out of Sight, Traffic) made an fascinating, psychological drama set in the near future. This is a remake of the 1972 Russian film, which it's based on a novel by Stanislaw Lem. Which originally that Three-Time Oscar Winner:James Cameron was going to directed but stayed on as one of the producers instead. Clooney gives one of the best performances here and he's has an strong presence in the film.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an good-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has an good-hearted, humorous commentary track by the director and producer:Cameron. DVD also has two featurettes, trailers and an still gallery (Which is the entire screenplay, written by the director). This science fiction drama was an major box office disappointment and it was misguided by the studio. Still, this film certainly did have an cult following on DVD. Although since \"Solaris\" is a very serious film, it does have comic relief from Davies' performance. It is worth seeing but certainly not for all tastes. Panavision. (****/*****).",

It is a very fascinating movie, raising all kinds of questions.Director and writer Steven Soderbergh does a pretty good job, presenting us all kind of beautiful images. Some scenes did remind me of '2001: A Space Odyssey'. The arrival of the spaceship and the way George Clooney looks in his helmet. In a way it is the same kind of science fiction movie, both without the usual sci-fi action, both inviting the audience talk about it after it is seen.Soderbergh and Clooney take a risk with this movie and I like it. It is no block-buster like 'Ocean's Eleven' or a intelligent movie but still made for large audiences like 'Out of Sight'. For some reason Soderbergh can handle a lot of different things and Clooney as an actor can as well. Fortunately there are still people who like to take the risk to make this kind of movie.Like I said Clooney stars as Chris Kelvin. He must visit the planet Solaris because strange things are happening. When he gets there he meets two survivors both a little strange. The first is Gordon (Viola Davis) who doesn't want a discussion with him until \"it happens to him\". The other is Snow (Jeremy Davies), who seems to be nervous whole the time. After Kelvin's first night his wife wakes up next to him. She committed suicide a few years earlier. In nice flashbacks we see how they met and hooked up on earth, where it is raining in every scene. His wife, played by Natasche McElhone, knows there is something wrong. She remembers things but she doesn't remember experiencing those things. She is not an imagination by Kelvin. Snow and Gordon see her and both had their own visitors. From this moment the story gets interesting every minute.I can understand many people will not like this movie. It doesn't come with a real solution, it moves slowly, there is not much talking, most things are not sure. But it also looks amazing, is very fascinating and you can talk about it for hours.

And now I have watched the Steven Soderbergh version with George Clooney.I think I understand the story, which is fairly simple. Kelvin (Clooney, in this version) is on planet-watching duty in orbit around the planet of Solaris. What nobody realises is that Solaris is able to feed off Kelvin's thoughts and memories and create, from them, a replica of Rheya, his late wife. And this forces him to re-examine memories which we would rather have left buried. So, much of what follows is flashbacks to incidents in their life together, and his reactions to the memories of then and to the replica Rheya now.It is an interesting science fiction notion and, to a more rigorous mind than mine, I am sure it is a very rewarding journey. Sadly, I have a complete absence of profundity. I am as shallow as a puddle. And, quite frankly, I found Kelvin, his problems, Rheya (both the original and the replica) and her problems, extremely tedious and boring.I've given Lem's novel a fair hearing, I think, having read it and watched two versions of it (in the grounds that I must be missing something, surely), but with a complete lack of engagement on each occasion.Solaris is not for me.",

An eerie sense of mystery is maintained throughout, which had me gripped until the end. In fact I felt this film was at least half an hour too short, basically ending as soon as the central theme of Kelvin's desire to resurrect his dead wife - excellently realised by the two actors - is fully played out. I was disappointed, however, that the film failed to explore in any depth the presence of the other \"visitors\" on the ship, which did not fit neatly in to the \"life after death\" theme. Of course we are told \"there are no answers, only choices\", but I would certainly have appreciated a deeper exploration of the choices made by the other characters. It's one of those films to leave a bittersweet taste in the mouth; for example the decision not to include Gordon's \"visitor\" at all I found a bit galling at first, but in retrospect may have been a brilliant device. I would have liked to have seen more about the moral dilemma facing these humans in the face of the \"facsimiles\".Though the acting was brilliantly restrained, I did feel the script denied the humanity of the astronauts to some extent, and would have enjoyed just a touch more psychodrama. None of the characters appeared to take any interest in each other at all, and though this was certainly consistent with the powerful character of Gordon, and though Kelvin was understandably preoccupied, the incoherence of the third character was rendered somewhat pointless by the fact that the visiting psychologist made no attempt to do his job.While I would like to point out that simply visually suggesting Philosophical themes is not quite the same as exploring them, this is still an excellent sci-fi film that fits firmly in to the tradition of Blade Runner and 2001 and the original Solaris.",

In fact, within the last 12 months, he has also released \"Ocean's 11\" and \"Full Frontal,\" the later of which I have not seen. \"Traffic\" was a riveting film. No one could argue with that. But, \"Solaris' was not really a project suited for Soderbergh's talents. He seems to fare better with simple real-to-life films, \"The Limey\" is a great example of this. \"Solaris\" is also dwarfed by Tarkovsky's original, which is an enigamtic as hell yet masterful piece of work. This film lacks the depth of imagery of the original, and it is really hard to Americanize such a film which was clearly very Russian in its themes when it came out in 1972. There is some sex here, and modern special effects wizardy than you don't see in the Tarkovsky film, but it doesn't make it any more memorable. But, I think it is a noble failure, and certainly proves Soderbergh and Clooney are not afraid to take risks, alas they did it much better in \"Out of Sight.\" Still one has to look forward to this talented director's next project, let's just hope it will not be based on a movie that's been done before.",

The butt shots, however, may be some of the more interesting details of this film. The film touches on some interesting ideas and will definitely pull at your heart strings a little. Unfortunately, the sum total elements of the film are only slightly engaging.As far as the plot goes, imagine the film Event Horizon. Now take out the gore and suspense. Turn up the emotional issues for the ladies out there, and you pretty much have Solaris. Clooney plays some sort of a psychiatrist who is called out to a space station to examine some of the odd goings on experienced by the crew already there. It seems that the nearby moon \"Solaris\" is playing mind games with the people sent to observe it. Basically, the moon can create clones of loved ones for each person that comes to close to it. Clooney, after his first night in the space station wakes up with a clone of his dead wife, for example. Another crew member is visited by a clone of his son. Another by a clone of himself, and so on. Clooney is still very much in love with his wife who committed suicide back on Earth, and now finds himself unable to say goodbye to a woman he knows is not really nor should be there with him.Rather than focus in depth on any possible scientific explanation, the film takes the emotional road more than anything else. We feel Clooney's pain, and that of the other crew members. That leads to a depressing experience watching this film. The film cheats in terms of its futuristic settings by having the majority of its shots be internals. The few externals we get are impressive (Jim Cameron was on board as a producer), but there should have been more of them. Also, too much time is spent with flashbacks to Earth where only people's clothing shows any sense of a futuristic setting. And once again, there are too many internal shots and the sense of wonder that should be found in a science fiction film is all but lost.This is one of those \"high concept\" sci-fi films, so we are left with some big time ambiguity toward the end. It worked for Stanley Kubrick, but not so well in this case. At only 99 minutes, the film seems half an hour longer. The character played by Jeremy Davies was most certainly meant to be weird, but he comes off more annoying than anything else. The scenes with him are like running over a big speed bump you weren't able to avoid.The film lost a small fortune at the box office, and I find that unfortunate. Not that Solaris is a good film, but it proves once again that films which don't pander to those with tiny brains often fail to make any money.The film had potential, but will ultimately go down as a failure.

In the futuristic world of his that doesn't get too over-the-top (such as Minority Report), he must go and try to solve bizarre occurings that are happening on a space station that is around the planet Solaris. He goes up, and, of course, sees a vision of his dead wife Rheya (Natascha McElhone). Soon he becomes transfixed and believes that she is the real deal, while other members Snow (Jeremy Davies) and Gordon (Viola Davis) try to convince him that it's a \"visitor\" from Solaris. Oddity ensues.This movie is unlike any others I have ever seen. Unlike the mindless blockbusters in the summer or the drek of the fall/spring, this movie is an original piece of work that really makes you think. Don't put your mind on hold. As soon as the art begins, you're transfixed with the escapades of Chris and co. Going into it, I was feeling somewhat apprehensive, because of the mixed review it has been garnering. All of the nay-sayers must not be able to think deeply and consider The Animal the greatest movie of all time.Clooney gives a compassionate performance, while McElhone is also incredable. The supporting characters were great and we can hope that their names go out in the future. The sweeping cinematography was so magnificent-the turns and the flashes and everything else. Its 99-minute runtime seemed long, but I wished it could have been longer.The music score proved that you don't need large booms to make effective. In fact, the point is made with silence a lot of times. The ending was perfect. It isn't cut-and-dry, but also it isn't so muddled and mucked up. It's open to debate, like all good movies should be. You can't really argue about Eight Crazy Nights. Like most classics, the ending is left to the imagination (2001 comes into mind again).Solaris is a spectacular achievement of mind and body with superb acting and an awesome script that leaves much to the imagination. Unfortunately, most audience will not like it because it isn't clear and they don't want to think.My rating: 10/10Rated PG-13 for sexuality/nudity, brief language and thematic elements.",

            "content": "I have not seen the original 1972 Solaris movie, nor have I read the book so these comments assess the 2002 Solaris movie as an independent story without regard to its originality nor adherence to the book. Perhaps the 1972 telling is better in conception and execution and if you choose to see only one Solaris, maybe the original is the better choice, or maybe not. But in either case, the 2002 Solaris definitely has significant merits. Two days after viewing the movie, I find myself still thinking about it.So, should you watch this movie? Is it good entertainment or a waste of time? That depends, of course, on your expectations so let's help set some expectations. More than most, this film requires you to be in the right mood; if you're in the right mood with the right expectations it is a pretty good movie. But if you're not, you certainly will not like it.Is it science-fiction? It has a science-fiction setting, and some science-fiction themes running through it but those themes are minor compared to its main themes and are not explored much. There are some acceptable special effects and science-fiction imagery but they provide a counterpoint to its brooding atmosphere more than anything else.This is a fairly serious film, with central themes exploring the \"human condition\" and human nature. The sci-fi setting allows the storyteller to put the characters into unusual situations that just don't otherwise occur, at least in the here and now. The characters will act and react according to how the storyteller, relying on her/his own sense of human nature, thinks they will. So it's a sort of thought-experiment. If the storyteller has real insight, the characters' actions will seem reasonable to us, although perhaps only after some thought because the situations are certainly unusual.What else does Solaris offer the viewer? It is one of a short list of \"puzzle\" movies. Such movies tell their story without any real third-party narration. They are seen entirely through the eyes of one or more characters; the audience is required to sort out the objective facts of the story from the subjective narration. Well, maybe this isn't the best definition, but it's somehow part of it. I'm thinking of, but not comparing Solaris to, movies like Sixth Sense and Identity. What was going on? Is that scene a flashback or occurring in the present or a dream? Does just the protagonist see that or does everyone? There was no objective narration; it was presented as an intellectual puzzle to the audience to solve. (To digress momentarily, I would argue that Sixth Sense presented enough clues, and presented them early enough that figuring out the solution to the puzzle was possible early in the movie. Whereas Identity did not present enough clues until late for the puzzle to be solved, thus becoming more of a surprise-ending movie.) Solaris is rich in a brooding atmosphere. And it has a slow pace, perhaps to give the audience time to think about each clue before the next is presented.So why watch Solaris? If you're interested in solving a \"puzzle\" movie, one that will possibly continue to engage your thoughts after the movie is done, if you're willing to explore some very serious themes about human nature and the human condition, and if your mood matches the brooding atmosphere and slow pace, then watch, puzzle, cogitate and drink it in.Is it a good movie? Within the constraints of the above, it is better than most. My chief praise for the storytelling is the way it continued to periodically deliver us puzzle clues, unlike some other movies which deliberately withhold the clues. And I was also pleased that there was a solution at the end, consistent with the clues and with the story pushing us towards it - although the interpretation of that end solution is open to discussion. So, as an intellectual puzzle, a good challenge but a fair one.I really enjoyed the acting and somewhat enjoyed most of the cinematography. I did not enjoy the music quite as much as most viewers posting here seem to have, but it wasn't jarring nor distracting. I also found the volume of the soundtrack uneven, so make sure you have your remote handy. And the pace could have been picked up just a little, but not too much or else it would have lost its atmosphere. Overall, an 8 out of 10 but not for everyone and make sure you're in the right mood.Hope this helps.",

            "content": "Having just watched the trailer for Steven Soderbergh's remake of Andrei Tarkovsky's Russian sci-fi classic, it seems to be some kind of action-horror hybrid. In fact, it's a solemn psychodrama about a psychologist named Chris Kelvin (George Clooney) who travels to a research station orbiting a planet called Solaris, where his late wife is brought back to physical life by an unseen alien intelligence.Tarkovsky's creeping meditation is more conversational and a (very) good hour longer than Steven Soderbergh's terse remake. Perhaps if Soderbergh and (producer) James Cameron had known it wouldn't break profit, they'd have gone easier in the editing room. Or perhaps they wouldn't have made it at all, which I suppose might have saved us from Ocean's Twelve.Tarkovsky's vision is my favourite of that director's films, and is also, arguably, the most accessible. It contains a more straightforward narrative than The Mirror, a slightly quicker (though not quick) pace than Stalker, and it's less dense and stagey than The Sacrifice. I feel it's the most successful blend of story and character in Tarkovsky's canon; the best balanced both emotionally and philosophically.Soderbergh's version, while seriously truncated, is an intelligent and often elegant work. Gone are the former filmmaker's Oedipal motifs, the existential monologues, and the weightless ballet. This is a taut film about the romanticising, catastrophising power of memory.Soderbergh dispenses with the now infamous 10-minute car journey sequence taken by Henri Burton (Vladislav Dvorzhetsky). Is Burton's car journey a reference to Bowman's \"Stargate\" experience in Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey? Later, aboard the space station, Snaut (J\u00fcri J\u00e4rvet) makes a speech questioning whether man should be exploring new worlds before he has learned to truly communicate with his fellow man. Burton's terrestrial \"journey\", after his experience with Solaris, is every bit as profound as Bowman's.Natascha McElhone, while not the match of Natalya Bondarchuk, who acted everyone off Tarkovsky's screen, delivers an eerie, uncanny performance as the almost-human Rheya, \"remembered wrong\". Clooney's Kelvin is a more glaring, shell-shocked presence than Donatas Banionis - whether you prefer the former's range to the latter's subtlety is up to you; each belongs to their own film.Soderbergh regular Cliff Martinez provides the bubbling, electro-orchestral score, lending the images a delicate sense of the lost, the wistful, and sometimes the dread. Where Tarkovsky's script was as cold and sprawling as space itself, Soderbergh's is warm and focused. And as for the ending - well, let's just say that the young buck doesn't try and take on the elder directly, choosing instead something softer, less awesome, yet still ambiguous and fascinating. Which fairly sums up the film, I think.",

            "content": "For the last couple of years, film audiences have gotten Science- Fiction films mixed with Science-Fantasy.  STAR WARS, LORD OF THE RINGS and MATRIX are Science-Fantasy, where 2001,A.I.: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, and MINORITY REPORT are Science-Fiction.  Science-Fantasy is more about locations, worlds, legend, and creatures/species.  Science-Fiction is more about taking the emotions and thoughts of the human mind that is explaining the philosophy of human existance.  Where more questions are given than answers provided.  Such as 2001, what did the monolith represent?  A.I., can a machine be intelligent enough to have emotions?  MINORITY REPORT, should the technique of preventing a crime still be used when people can possibly change their mind and not commit the crime?  Steve Soderbergh's lastest masterpiece, SOLARIS, ask the question, can a person love a being that looks, acts, and has the memory of a deceased loved one, but really isn't that person?SOLARIS is based on the Stainslaw Lem novel that was made into a long, but very well done film by Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky.  The story is set in the future, psychartrist Chris Kelvin (George Clooney) who has been suffering for the last couple of months after the sucide death of his wife Rheya (the very beautiful Natascha McElhone).  Chris is asked to go out to the space station that is above the water planet of SOLARIS where all but two of the crewmen have died.  When Chris arrives on SOLARIS, he sees that the two survivors, Snow (Jeremy Davis) and Helen Gordon (Viola Davis), are still having psychological sufferings.  As Chris investigates with what happened at the station, he wakes from sleeping one time to see a person or creature that is exactly the splitting image of the deceased Rheya.  In one of the most heartbreaking scenes in cinema, Chris dismisses this person or thing being his dead wife back from the dead and sends her out into space as he breaks down into tears.  Then a few hours later after Chris goes to sleep again, the appearance of the thing that looks and acts like Rheya appears again.  And should Chris believe that it is Rheya back from the dead?  Or is this a hallucination that is created by Chris' mind?SOLARIS is like Kubrick's 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, in being a film that is full of philosophic questions.  I feel the reason why nimrods are dismissing and getting angry with SOLARIS is that they believe it will be as fun filled like OCEAN'S ELEVEN, or action packed like ALIENS since Soderbergh and James Cameron worked on the film.  It's not.  If there is any movie where your brain is required to be used before seeing the movie, while seeing the movie, and after seeing the movie, SOLARIS is that film!  If you don't like using your brain while watching a movie, then catch the next showing of DIE ANOTHER DAY or MAID IN MANHATTAN.SOLARIS is a film that proves that Steve Soderbergh IS one talented and versatile director.  Most entertainment shows and film audiences think of Soderbergh as the director of easy to understand films like OCEAN'S 11 and ERIN BROCKOVICH.  But this is the same brillant mind behind complex films like SEX LIES & VIDEOTAPE, THE LIMEY, and TRAFFIC.  While I personally find TRAFFIC to still be Soderbergh's best film, a hair-line fracture behind TRAFFIC is now SOLARIS.  I was so glad and pleased to see that Soderbergh respected the story and sci-fi genre by making SOLARIS into a highly intellectual film where thoughts are required, characters are the key element to a film, and technology and location are used with what they should be used for, background support!Georgy Clooney proves that he IS one of the best and underrated actors working in Hollywood.  Clooney does a fantastic job with his acting of the in-pain and confused Chris Kelvin.  But the scene that really got me emotional was the scene when Chris breaksdown in tears.  Natascha McElhone, I have always seen to be a very beautiful and underrated actress that should be given more leading roles.  In SOLARIS, McElhone manages to have one can't help but to think about their significant other (being male and female) and just wanting to love them even more.  Jeremy Davis does a fantastic job as the some-what disturbed and confused Snow, who might or might not have to answers to the happenings on the station.  And Viola Davis is good as the strong minded and conflicting Gordon.If SOLARIS proves anything, it's that Soderbergh, unlike most Hollywood directors, hasn't sold out to the evils of box office success, and continue to make films the way he wants to make them, and tell the stories the way he wants to tell them.  Why are people walking out of this movie angry and upset?  I believe it is because the film requires a lot of thought.  This same exact thing reminded me of a film that was released last year that I loved but people looking for a brainless film hated, VANILLA SKY.  And for those who hated VANILLA SKY, then stay away from SOLARIS.  But for those who like intelligence and symbolism as a main ingredant for a film, then SOLARIS is the ideal film for you.   Right now, most people will be dismissing SOLARIS as a slow, weird, and pointless film.  But ask me this question, what movie will be more talked about and praised twenty years from now, SOLARIS or XXX?  Only time will tell, but I'll be hoping it's SOLARIS. Since SOLARIS is becomming to be a box office failure, hopefully like another intellectual sci-fi film that suffered the same fate, BLADE RUNNER, SOLARIS, WILL be the next cult favorite.  This is one of the best films of 2002, and please see SOLARIS the way the film should be seen, on the big screen.  ***** (out of five) ONE OF THE BEST FILMS OF 2002!!!",

            "content": "The film is a MASTERPIECE.I still don't know what I think of it but I think its a masterpiece.Its been ages since I've seen the Tarkovsky film, not since it came on tape had I watched it from start to finish. I have the DVD but the last time I actually tried to watch it was on IFC when sunspots were messing up reception. I gave up when the picture kept skewing.Regardless of when I saw the first film it has haunted me ever since, its mediations on memory and going home again have stayed with me since I saw the film some ten or fifteen years ago. I'm so haunted by the film I was curious what Soderbergh and Cameron would do with the film.The plot essentially is the same as the first film, which is such a stripped down version of the novel by Stanislaw Lem that he all but disowned it.Actually the film follows reasonably closely Tarkovsky's film for the first 35 or 40 minutes before adding new bumps to the story that spin it off into new directions.What the film is about is a meditation on love and god and existence and other stuff. Its an equally valid take on the story as Tarkovsky's and equally intriguing.Of course the film bombed- with the people involved people in America wanted action.But there is none, or little. There is more alluded to than in the first film, but basically this is 95 minutes of people talking and brooding and emoting and simply being and trying to come to terms with life. There is no car chase or shoot outs or anything other than a planet, two spaceships and people. This is a film that requires an investment on the part of the audience and if you can't or won't work with it and meet it half way you're going to think its awful.Yes its pretentious twaddle but it still is asking some very interesting questions and providing no answers.I can only imagine what people going in expecting a scifi thriller made of this film which is like the best scifi not really about the sci or the fi but about us here and now. Soderbergh and Cameron had ideas they wanted to explore , ideas which simply could not work in a realistic setting and so grafted them into a scifi story which would allow their ideas to grow.No the film is not perfect. There are bumps and jumps and oddities, at least I think their are since I saw this in three parts broken by two interruptions. But flaws or no the ideas flow through.If you can see the film letterboxed the compositions are very deliberate and balanced. Also see if you can see it with a good sound system because the sound, the music mostly creates and excellent mood and audioscape.Go in clear minded and know that you may have to see it a second or third time simply because its similarities to the first film are at times distracting since you lean towards one way while the movie goes the other.What is the plot, I hear you asking...Kris Kelvin goes to a space station around the planet Solaris to investigate strange happenings there. Things become even more complicated when his dead wife shows up.Its really not much more than that. I could tell you the whole plot, and even then it wouldn't make a damn bit of difference since the plot is incidental to the discussions.Forgive me I'm still pondering this film over an hour after the fact...If you love to think or question see the film. If you love films with out any answers see the film.If you want it all explained, then stay away, this is not for you. The same thing if you want a film that is more than talk.If you are adventurous and open see this movie....",

            "content": "When discussing what is out there in the universe and beyond, people often bring up very compelling questions. Unfortunately, the most intriguing ideas about the cosmos haven't translated that well to movies, making the sci-fi genre a long line of movies essentially about blowing up aliens with lasers. There are plenty of great sci-fi movies, but few stray from the never-ending battle of human vs. alien. `Solaris' deserves attention not for the mini-controversy surrounding its rating (a publicity stunt by Twentieth Century Fox because they reportedly had trouble finding ways to market the movie) but for having a premise set in deep space that doesn't involve evil aliens preying on overmatched humans.In `Solaris', George Clooney plays Chris Kelvin; a psychologist dispatched to a space station orbiting the titular planet to find out what went wrong on a routine exploration mission. When Kelvin arrives, he finds that two crewmembers are dead, and one of the two survivors has locked herself in her quarters because of what has gone on in the space station. When Kelvin finally does persuade the reclusive Dr. Gordon (the excellent Viola Davis) to talk, she tells him that `It isn't really worth talking about until it starts happening to you.'Though `Solaris' is a deliberately slow paced movie, `It' happens to Kelvin after his first night on the station; he wakes up to a kiss from his wife Rheya- who died years earlier. More haunting is the fact that she is not a figment of Chris' imagination, Rheya (played by Natacha McElhone) can recite memories of the life she and Chris shared together without any help from him. Both Clooney and McElhone fit their roles perfectly. Natacha McElhone has an intriguing beauty and she uses it to fit the haunting atmosphere of the film, and Clooney increasingly shows the wear of an intelligent man who cannot comprehend the events transpiring around him, and ends up with one of his best performances to date.What drives the film is the originality of the story. `Solaris'was written as a novel by Stanislaw Lem, and first adapted to film in 1972 by the legendary Russian filmmaker Andrei Tarkovsky. Tarkovsky's is a sci-fi classic and considered by many to be the foreign equivalent to `2001: A Space Odyssey.' Steven Soderbergh (who won Best Director for `Traffic'- itself a remake) refuses to call this `Solaris' a remake, and contends that his film is simply a new adaptation of Lem's novel.Soderbergh's argument is credible, his `Solaris' is almost half the length of Tarkovsky's near 3-hour epic, his screenplay concentrating mostly on the relationship of Rheya and Kelvin.The 1972 version eyes the scientific morals of the mission, something completely missing from the latter movie. The 2002 `Solaris' is a chilling film with great acting that asks intriguing questions about humanity, space and essentially love itself. Tarkovsky's `Solaris' is the superior film, but unlike many remakes, Soderbergh's film does not disgrace the original.\nGrade: B+",

The question of their nature, their origin, their purpose is key as they are not aggressive, not \"aliens in disguise\".George Clooney delivers a good performance and while the film takes us miles away from a typical SF movie into a psychological drama, a debate on reality, love even, I would say that the result is surprisingly good.Still enigmatic, the very nature of Solaris, the nature of the \"visitors\", only tends to find an explanation through metaphysical and religious terms. It opens a debate as well on \"what is a person\" and \"what is the essence of a person\", never quite a full answer in the film, nor in the book.",

In my opinion Clooney was very good, just like Jeremy Davies and Natascha McElhone. I didn't watch the Russian original \"Solyaris\" so I cannot compare it to this American one. But the story is simply great and I bow to the people who wrote this, so I probably guess that original is better (I have to find the original).

            "review_title": "Loved it--but only in comparison to Russian Version.",
            "content": "I LOVED this movie, but after a bit of reflection I think that most of what I liked about it relate directly to how it does or does not deviate from the Tarkovsky version. I'm not sure how much I would have cared if I had seen it on its own. MANY people walked out of the opening night screening I was at. Today a Fox exec in the NYTimes says he guesses \"it wasn't the Holiday Fare we thought it would be.\" Well, Fox Exec, maybe a brain would be in order. It's too bad this film will be seen as a flop because they're putting it out in a season and with a campaign guarateeing it to tank. Nice move, Fox. The performances all round were good. The acting here is extra challenging because they have to act realistically in a totally bizarre and false situation, and I think they all do well. In this way it reminded me of \"Existenz\"--having to act naturally in a surreal situation. At first I was thinking \"I am being prevented from examining the serious moral and philosophical issues presented here because George Clooney is just SO DAMN HANDSOME!\" but I think it's a testament to his acting that it is possible to forget that after a while. The real revelation was Natasha McE, who I think had to show some of the most raw emotions in situations that don't call for it, and she really ran off with the gold. The script--and this may come as a surprise to those who say this is the most boring thing they had ever seen--was clearly written to emphasize the THRILLER aspect of the story. If you've seen the 3-hour Russian version (which I wrote a scathing review about on IMDb, but has grown in my estimation since) you can spend the first half-hour admiring the economy with which the story is told. I also loved the care and composition of every shot in the first two-thirds. The conception of the planet was very good, very beautiful, but, like much of the film, I think it got away from Soderbergh in the end. No one ever comes out and SAYS \"the planet is a sentient being,\" and I think it would have helped the movie if they had, because just changing the color of the planet as the film moves along and interspersing shots of it with George thinking does NOT necessarily make the connection, and toward the end it began to feel like \"Hmm, I don't know what to do here... okay, let's just show the planet again!\" This film erred on the side of subtlety too often I thought, which may be admirable in some situations, but here I think it actually held the film back, because if you HAD the information, you could proceed to think about what was happening and what it meant, rather than just trying to catch up with what was happening at all. Some things I think should have been SAID OUTRIGHT: (SPOILERS here:) \"The planet is a sentient being!\" \"But your wife is dead!\" \"My wife was unfaithful!\" \"My wife killed herself!\" and \"The space station is sinking INTO the planet!\"(SPOILERS END) I really enjoyed the music. It was very reminiscent of Philip Glass (and I can't help thinking would have been better if it WERE by Philip Glass, not that I don't love ya, Cliff, and that opening music to \"Kafka\" is ASTOUNDING). I also loved the long musical passages of the film, I wish more films would do this--though of course then it would turn to crap. Unfortunately, I feel like Soderbergh lost control of the film at the end. I was quite surprised at the beginning that he had jettisoned Kelvin's father and the rest of his family, a decision that I think comes back to haunt the ending, and really strip it of the emotional heft the earlier version had. This version, limiting the focus only to the love of the wife, and moving away from her place within the larger scope of his family and his entire existence, I think made the film a bit banal in the end. Okay, let's face it, the whole concept of this movie is straight outta original series Star Trek, but for the way it's handled, but compared to the Tarkovsky, it just seems less weighty. This movie begins to lose focus in the final third, and even the shots themselves do not seem as controlled. I was stunned that he also dropped the final shot of the Tarkovsky version, which almost single-handedly explained what you just saw, and I just don't think that what he came up with compared in any way. The placement of the flashbacks also just started to feel arbitrary, and the one crucial one RIGHT at the end I really think should have been inserted much before, it has the effect of stopping the momentum. Nevertheless, I can't wait to see it again. I think I might rent the Tarkovsky version (and watch it with the benefit of a fast-forward button) then see this once more. I also think, if you're going to see it, DON'T rent it, but definitely see it in all its beauty on the big screen, and when your attention will be focused on the screen.Regardless of the minor flaws, big props to Steven and George for doing this. I wish this film would always be at theaters so I could go see it whenever I want.--- Check out website devoted to bad and cheesy movies: www.cinemademerde.com",

The main problem seems the fact that even such a tragic-romantic adaptation seems too demanding for mass audience fed with Hollywood pap. If in the future someone else dared a faithful adaptation, I am afraid the effects would be understood only by a tiny audience.I read the book, and I think that in fact that book is about the unattainable, and inconceivable.

I found that the pace was fine in fact - the tension racketed up and racketed up as you realised (SPOILERS) that she wasn't going to die, that Snow was a copy, that Chris wasn't going to leave, that Chris was also a copy (that has to be the most heart stopping moment of all). The whole mystery of it - this place that this planet has created where these 'people' can now exist - is what gives it is force, exemplified by the repeated Thomas line - 'lovers may be lost but love is not'. And this was not overly sentimental at all but had a moving truth to it. There was a certain chill and coldness - I didn't get lost in their story as I may have in a more conventional movie - but I liked the sense that the main character was being driven forward by guilt - and of course first time round he reproduces that mistake.

Solaris is as devoid and sterile of genuine thought and emotion as its crash bang counterparts are.Mr. Soderbergh has made \"Solaris\" a post-modern love story.

It is a contemplative experience with visual and acoustic brilliance which never gets boring though there is not too much happening on screen. Well, the casting of Natascha McElhone was certainly a big addition to the atmosphere - not because she is especially good, but because she has a certain scary quality about her which is hard to bear. The are scenes in which she is looking directly into the camera where I for my part would not like to be alone in a room with her. Soderbergh could have casted a beautiful woman - that would have made the movie a different film - but he decided to cast McElhone, and therefore gave the movie an eery, surreal touch. Well done!All in all a very satisfying movie which certainly could have been faster, longer or more action packed, but that would not have captured Stanislaw Lems spirit - and though I hardly remember the book, having read it a decade ago, I am sure that in spite of many changes the movie captures it right now.

Speaking of which, I enjoyed the original, admired the book, and I actually think Soderbergh improved on both by using a lot of pure film technique to make it more taut. There's very little in the way of loud action movie over-explanation here.What I did find particularly delightful is the commentary on the DVD edition -- James Cameron and Soderbergh talking about many of the choices that went into the movie, a host of techniques, where they think they made mistakes, what they did differently but then changed back, and so on. You couldn't have two more different directors in on a collaboration, and it's really quite cool to listen to their dialogue about the making.So here's the punchline: while this is definitely a filmmaker's film, it's even more of a film student's film. For those of you who haven't done the same and are of the analytic bent, it's great fun to go through the film, then the commentary, then read the screenplay (included no the DVD!), then go back and see the Tarkovsky and then go back to the Lem novel. You could do a whole intro to film technique course that way.I give it a 6/10 on merit but an 8/10 on guilty pleasures for peeking inside the filmmaker's toolbox.",

If you're looking for an existential drama set in space, Solaris works better.It's difficult to describe the story, but the acting and production keeps you interested, even when it's unclear what's happening. The photography, editing, and music are simply brilliant. Those who have seen the seduction scene in Soderbergh's Out of Sight will recognise that same style throughout the whole film. I haven't read Lem's book, or seen Tarkovsky's film, but I found Solaris to be quite hypnotic. If anything, I wish the film had been half an hour longer, as it feels a bit rushed towards the end now.

This movie is a thing of beauty, anyone that needs a car chase or some kind of explosion, nudie scene, or murder, stay away, everyone else please watch. I was not a fan of George Clooney, now I am. His performance is one of the top 5 in the last 20 years, this role is so hard to play and yet he plays it beautifully. Kudos for the director who gave this pretty boy the role of his career. McElhone is excellent as his wife. The only weakness on this movie is Davies, too over the top, too cliche, it is a shame because it is the only thing that stops this movie from being absolutely perfect. As far as the direction, it is fantastic, this is one of the most intimate movies ever filmed. The presentation of Clooney's encounter with his wife from the beginning to the end of their marriage is gorgeous, 100 words are maybe exchanged and yet a lifetime is presented. The score is excellent, it is so original, it would have been out of place anywhere else but here. As far as anyone saying this movie is slow, they have been playing to many video games. This is an excellent mystery/romance/sci-fi/thriller, all wrapped into one. 8.5/10",

Or, maybe solaris is heaven, Or, an alien planet that manipulates ones mind so that what the experience seems real, even though it's not.The discussion at the table concerning god and religion etc,.. was such a joke, very weak, and dumbed down to a point of meaninglessness.The movie is very SSsssssLLllllllOOoooooooWWwwwwwwwww paced. And, the transition from one scene to flashback to another scene reminded me of Microsoft PowerPoint, you know with the cheesy image transitions. Also, The movie does, however, stretch ones imagination, only cause you'd have to imagine the possibilities that the movie doesn't seem to address properly. There are subtleties that I liked, however, like the slight touching of the hand with his fianc\u00e9e. But that was all. I didn't get the connection with the boy holding his hand out to the main character during the finale.One commenter had this to say which made me laugh heartedly: \" explores the uncharted realms of the human condition as much as the unknown realities of the universe, and swims upstream against the currents of ethics, physics, and even metaphysics, you will probably enjoy this moody, slow, multi-leveled and heavily textured film.\"human condition\" ?? what ? being trapped in a spaceship with illusions of lost love, is a metaphor for the Human Condition ? yeah Right...Unknown realities of the Universe ? like staring at the miasma of cream and hot coffee at the break of dawn.Multi-leveled ? reality and illusion, afterlife, spirit world dreamworld alien simulated life ? whatever man.. doesn't look multi-leveled to me, just your basic dreamy romance story in a spaceship setting entering a world of illusion.but then again, \"what is real?\" Well, how about a better movie like \"The matrix\".In order to be receptive to this movie you'd need a particular frame of mind: \"high on weed\".However, the acting by all the cast was solid, just the way in which this movie was written. And, the music was, well, great if you need to get some sleep.Overall the movie seemed low budget and unfinished. the concept wasn't depicted strong enough, and the slow pace makes the mind wander and thus doesn't do much to keep one interested enough.I know a good film when I see, it, and Solaris is marginal at best. Hardly worth the the price of a good book.If there is one thing I hate, are Writers that do these stupid remakes, add a few differences here, there, better graphics, steal other writers ideas then viola', everybody calls Steven Soderbergh a genius, quite the contrary, for this film, no way.One facet I did like about this film is the point where Chris realizes Nobody ever knows all there is to know about another person, and that's what makes the surrealism of the story so compelling or wishy washy, mixed up and meaningless.And, this sums up it all up, from another commenter: Soderbergh has managed to leave out just about everything that could justify the title .Serious, it was a weak film, However I respect Soderbergh cause of his other work. Oh well, remakes are usually lame anwyay.",

I can understand the criticism of some other contributors stating that the movie is not very authentic with respect to the book, although it it is called Solaris and states in its credits that it is based on the book. This is of course misleading and it would have been better to give it a different name and rather say that it was \"inspired\" by Lem's novel. Therefore I only gave a 9 to a film which I otherwise would have graded 10. Because in its own right I find it very well made indeed. The subject is an absolutely relevant one: Who are we? What makes us human? What is life? What is love? Do we need explanations or meaning in life? The movie concentrates on these questions, different from the book. This is a completely legitimate approach. Don't concentrate on the comparison of film and book, and you are fine. I got curious to reread the novel, and I am not expecting to find too much from the movie in it. That's OK.Also the cinematic realization and the acting was very good. The planet, the spaceship, the drama of the relationship between \"humans\" and \"replicas\". Who is human and who replica in the end? Who dreams whom? The result seems to be that being human is defined by nothing else than the relationships themselves, to persons or to the inanimate world. And in Solaris, this \"inanimate\" world turns out to be more alive than expected, another subject worth being explored.I really cannot understand the relative low rating of around 6 and the many negative reviews this film has received.

I still don't know what I just saw an hour ago, but I think I liked it quite a bit. (I never saw the Russian original --I never cared to.) I could describe the film's plot but I don't think it would make any difference. It is a hermetically sealed psychodrama set aboard a spaceship orbiting a sentient planet called Solaris (I think). George Clooney is in top form in a very difficult role as a psychiatrist trying to figure out what the heck is driving people nuts aboard the ship. Jeremy Davies is a wonder to behold as one of the people who has witnessed many of the goings on. His performance recalls Brad Pitt's work in \"12 Monkeys\" (but imagine Pitt in slow motion from that film and you'll have Davies in this). It is, however, very tough film to sit through. The story doesn't unfold before your eyes so much as it thaws before your eyes. It is a 2 hour film that plays like 3. Several people in the audience walked long before this film ended and I can't say that I blamed them. Nevertheless with that said, \"Solaris\" does have a weird trance-like power. It isn't so much spellbinding as it is intriguing. The ending definitely raises some questions. It is a beautiful film to watch. The production is first class. It defies easy easy explanation and I doubt that it will do much box office. You got to give Soderbergh credit trying something very different. Whether he succeeded or not is not up for popular vote but is up to you --the individual viewer. It is a very unique and very strange film with an odd power.

Strange things are going on with the crew. When he gets there, he finds some of the crew have killed themselves; dead loved ones have appeared to people in the space station, and shortly after his own arrival, his late wife Rheya shows up. Is she real? Is she a figment of his imagination? Is she some sort of planetary manifestation? Rheya remembers their life together, but no emotion of actual involvement. Helen Gordon (Davis) thinks she's a destructive facsimile, while Chris wants to believe she's real and wants to be reunited with her.Though slow-moving and dialogue-heavy, \"Solaris\" is still an effective and thought-provoking film, tapping into something very universal - the desire to be reunited with those we've lost. Chris isn't a religious man and has to question his own belief system as he looks back on his life with Rheya, while Rheya suspects that she isn't really Rheya at all. Meanwhile, Helen is pushing for Rheya to be destroyed as a dangerous entity that can make trouble on earth.I haven't read the book or seen the Russian film - I understand this is quite different.

As we were paying our entrance fee, the cashier at the Multiplex advised us not to see it. Said it was the most boring picture she had ever seen in her life and people were walking out.Next as we were giving our tickets to the ticket taker,he again repeated how many people had walked out of the film, angry and bored, wanting their money refunded. He told us that if after 25 minutes, we didn't want to see anymore of the film, we could leave and go in to see the new James Bond movie at no extra charge. We sat down to watch the film, I checked my watch and when I checked again an hour had passed. Obviously we were not bored. We were most interested in what was coming next and why. However, we did see a few people walk out.As for trying to analyze the film, why bother! I think that one of the problems is that everyone wants a beginning, middle and end plus a rational reason for everything. It's like looking at an abstract painting that seemingly has no meaning except in the eye of the beholder.The changing scenes and moods appealed to us.We chose to look no further than that.As for the ending,and I think this might be  a spoiler, I thought of the long time ago movie \"Splash' One of Tom Hanks early films along with Daryl Hannah. The majority of the viewers who saw it, would have preferred the mermaid to become an earthly woman. Instead, Tom Hanks preferred devoting his life to her, splashing together in the sea. They wanted to be together. Same thing with \"Solaris\" Did it really matter where they were? Probably the majority of the population that saw the film and stayed till the end would have liked to hear that the entire film was a figment of Kelvin's imagination and never happened at all. They just wanted to be together.There is no answer I can give. After all the universe is infinite.We can always ask the question, what is outside the universe????Back to \"Solaris\" Too bad so many people were \"bored\" and walked out angrily asking for a refund (which the manager gave, due to such anger) We discussed it with him and quote his feelings \"A great deal of the masses are asses\"",

            "review_title": "Soderbergh's sci-fi exercise, eye candy and nothing else",
            "content": "After just seeing Solaris, I have worked and re-worked my thoughts on Steven Soderbergh to a point that I think is finally expressible.  Let me start by acknowledging Soderbergh's obvious and pure talent; it is total, visually evocative as well as thematically minded, and his films are often a pleasure to watch for their keen cinematic intellect.  However, I tend to think, particularly after Solaris, that Soderbergh is still searching to channel that boundless, preternatural cinematic gift into his great masterpiece. His career has been spotty so far.  Between films, and even within films, he can go from inspired to pretentious film-school brat in a matter of shots. His more successful ventures (at least the ones I have appreciated the most: Out of Sight, The Limey, and Traffic) have contained only a modicum of that generic, `indie' (which I use pejoratively) and a lot of worthwhile bits. But Soderbergh is still searching for something, a genre, a style, an expressive voice, maybe even a muse.  I like to think of his movies as exercises.  Traffic was an exercise in using an Altman-esque sense of scope and interlocking stories to politically condemn the American involvement in the drug trade.  Out of Sight was an exercise in creating a cool, up-to-date crime caper and giving two of our sexiest and most bankable STARS meaty roles.  Sex, lies, and videotape was an exercise in seeing exactly how far the early independent filmmaking scene could be stretched.  Et cetera, et cetera.  Solaris is just another installment in his succession of filmic exercises.All of the director's usual production values are in place in Solaris, and they are more effective than ever:  The jittery handheld camera for intimate scenes, the blue filters for emotional distance, and the fabulous movement-cinematography (this time, as usual, by Soderbergh, with nom de cine).  Solaris' (and Soderbergh's) best visual creation is the solaris itself, a swirling nebula of pink and orange.  He keeps returning to this image, as if he knew it would become the one with the most staying power.\nI mentioned all of these visual components first, because they fully overshadow any plot or characterizations that might be present in the movie. Essentially, Chris Kelvin (George Clooney) is a psychologist asked to journey to Solaris, a space station floating dangerous close to the aforementioned pink nebula.  He has been summoned because of some extraordinary goings-on at the space station that basically remain unnamed throughout.  To add a dimension to Kelvin, he is grieving over the loss of his wife (played by Natascha McElhone in a very muted, nearly plastic performance).  The reason Kelvin was summoned into space stays as nebulous as the solaris:  weird things have been happening and the remaining crew members (Viola Davis and Jeremy Davies, both passable in their parts and well-cast) have been visited by facsimiles of their deceased loved ones. All three reach a psychological breaking point when Kelvin is visited by his dead wife and ethical issues over her existence, the fine line between life and death, and her proposed termination arise.That is basically all there is to the plot, and why an emphasis is better placed on Solaris' production values.  This seems like an aesthetic, stylistic exercise for Soderbergh.  He is merely playing with eye candy, cloaking a thin script (a supposedly thin adaptation of Tarkovsky's classic film of the same title) in a lot of evocative stuff.  But there isn't much here, not much for audience and director alike to sink their teeth into, and it seems as if Soderbergh knows that.To hit upon George Clooney for a moment, this is one of his more serious-minded performances but that by no means suggests it is his best. Clooney, one of the sexiest men in movies by default, has risen above all his star power by making the most consistently smart movie choices of anyone in Hollywood.  I don't know if this is as smart a move for him as, say, David O. Russell's Three Kings or the Coen's O Brother, Where Art Thou?, but it is interesting and shows balls.  He tampers down his inherent charisma in Solaris, but when he allows it to shine through, those moments constitute some of the best scenes in the film.  Whatever you make of his performance, it is a gutsy one for a star of his caliber, even if the material isn't particularly groundbreaking or even well-constructed.",

            "content": "As a sort of fan of the original, this was one of the few movies that nowadays I have bothered to go to see in the cinema. Having seen it once I wasn't overly impressed by the movie as a whole, but primarily by Steven Soderbergh's extraordinary photography of Natascha McElhone's lambent beauty.Since the film has made its way to satellite and cable, however, I discover that I cannot resist putting it on and watching it again, and allowing myself to be subsumed by the utterly tragic mood. The main contributor to this is Cliff Martinez's phenomenal score in which the constant thrumming of steel drums over an ethereal orchestra carries you through long exploratory shots of the luminous sea of Solaris, or eloquent silences between characters.Clooney and McElhone are very affecting as the, almost literally, \"star-crossed lovers\". Unfortunately I find the two Davi(e)ses somewhat detracting from the whole, with Jeremy's \"Snow\" a slacker whom it is difficult to believe would qualify to fly in space, and Viola's \"Gordon\" seems to be out of a rather more conventional \"space alien\" movie - in fact her performance more than a little resembles Yaphet Kotto's in the movie 'Alien'! Ulrich Tukur as Gibarian, however, is a wonderfully understated reminder of the original material's European origins.The one failing of this movie compared to its predecessor is Soderberg's inability to portray Solaris as a character in its own right, something Tarkowsky seemingly managed with ease.",

            "review_title": "Where Real Science Fiction Meets Hollywood",
            "content": "In one of the special features documentaries coming with the DVD, director Soderbergh explains his 'Solaris', as a science fiction work 'as it used to be': less about robot fights and laser guns, more about humans. He is correct, with one observation - Real science fiction always was, is, and will be about human beings and their emotions - fear, hope, love. It is Hollywood who hijacked the genre and transformed it in a commercial pop-art based mainly on effects, at the expense of what real art is meant to be. But not all cinema is done at Hollywood, thanks God, and directors like Soderbergh find ways to do good films even in the Hollywood system.\nFor example, this 'Solaris' is a legitimate attempt to reconcile the two approaches. It takes the classic 'Solaris' book (by Stanislaw Lem) and picture  (a real masterpiece by Tarkowski) and  gives it a Hollywood twist - the story is more about relationship and human emotion, less about the experience to discover a new civilisation and world, with different rules than ours. This works no bad, and 'Solaris' is a good film. The robot fights and laser guns fans will be disappointed, but they have many other films to satisfy their lust.Compared with the classical film of Tarkowski this 'Solaris' loses in depth - but it is probably on purpose. Staging and camera are good, though reminding too much of Kubrick's '2001'. Casting is interesting - most of the characters including George Clooney seem slightly mis-casted, but it somehow helps, adding to the strange atmosphere of the film. Clooney always seems to act better than you would expect, and I wonder why. It may be his looks that are too close to the 50's legends (Carry Grant, James Stewart). But then, as in 'Brother' he surprises the audiences for the good. I kind of dis-liked the final. It tried to be at the same time original and happy-end-ish, but it looked confusing and cheap to me. However, there was a lot of good stuff in the rest of the film to make it worth watching. 8/10 on my personal scale.",

            "content": "Several things must handshake well together in order for me to actually recommend it to people. You know what they are: an engaging plot, believable acting, creative cinematography, and a nice film score (or nice choice in music). The story truly was a bit eerie as the plot thickened and morphed. By the end of the film, I sensed my own paranoia as I put my own mind in the situation.All the characters really drew me in to their situations - the fact that there were so few main characters (including, the planet Solaris, which I consider a character) made it even better. The scenes were amazingly shot. Not every camera was set to the best framing - what film has *every* camera shot that tight - but I cheered the cinematographer when his name flashed on the screen (and later found out that Steve Soderbergh was the cinematographer after all).Within 10 minutes of the start of the movie (watching it at home) I searched for the film score, and now have a CD. The scoring blended seamlessly with the feature. But IMHO, I can see where some people can't embrace this tight film. Working behind the camera for a news organization, I've learned quickly that people in general don't like to sit through something that doesn't move, change, and develop quickly. And they tend to enjoy film scores with a faster beat, or even something with a more dramatic flair. The scoring by Cliff Martinez was magnificent, and any other type of scoring, or adding what I call \"Bruckheimer beats\" (music in films produced by Jerry Bruckheimer) would have destroyed it. Some people are uncomfortable with films that have lots of \"air time,\" which allow one to think, feel, and allow all the aspects of a movie to surround the viewer and seep in. It lacks in testosterone scenes. While I enjoy those films as well, this one I thoroughly enjoyed and will watch over and over. But I would recommend them only to people who can not only appreciate a character-driven film that relies on plot rather than adrenaline, but also wants a movie that doesn't have to spell everything out for the viewer. Does a film-goer have to rely on getting all the answers, when we can make our own conclusions, based on our own life's experiences and personalities?",

This sci fi movie is definitely for the cerebral and humanistic type of audience who like strange, mysterious alien influences that seem to get under your skin - to feel and experience what's going on in a movie. It is definitely a relationship movie about what it means to be human and to make human choices. This is going to be a great cult movie in American science fiction (though a bit overly simplistic and too cute for the taste of the intelligent, International, sci fi community. The relationship between Kelvin and the first appearance isn't given nearly sufficient screen time and the female scientist on board the space station isn't given enough depth and \"almost\" becomes more of a stereotypical character. However, on the whole, this sci fi movie is a great substantive, a heavy-weight in science fiction, much like \"Forbidden Planet\" or \"The Day the Earth Stood Still\" were classics of the 1950s. But that doesn't mean that it will be a popular hit with the general public, it definitely won't be because most of the audience won't understand what's going on and it,s way too slow for the average American filmgoer.",

            "review_title": "Suspended Animation",
            "content": "I think Solaris is a great film. I was really struck by the vulnerability George Clooney allowed himself to display in this film. What I mean by this, is that in in a lot of films, I felt when Clooney was smiling, his eyes were sad. Solaris really exposed something I felt he had all the time, but maybe he wasn't ready for it until Solaris.Aesthetically I think the film is beautiful. The color palettes in this film range from deep browns, to dark greens, which when combined with rain, gave Earth a muted darkness. On the other hand, Solaris is full of raging electrical storms and vivid light. One could make the case that the 6&7th characters in the film are Earth and Solaris. All of the casting was great, particularly Natascha McElhone, because she has a compelling face, that, in some points of the film looked other worldly, which allows you to accept that fact she isn't human. I also felt Soderbergh did a great job in giving the film a retro SCI-FI look, which didn't lock the viewer into thinking about technology, so that you could concentrate on the plot of the film, which is really where the viewer's focus is needed.The action in Solaris, is the mind of the viewer and the viewer's ability to accept what is put before them(Rheya) and to also think about what wasn't tangible on film, such as Gordon's visitor. For example, I think Snow is just an interpretation on human beings tendency to take on the characteristics of people around us, or assimilation. I think Snow is saying if there is complete assimilation, a part of the individual dies, or can't survive. Kelvin(Clooney)is a juxtaposition between the Kelvin on Earth, who ignores some clear signs that Rheya is unable to commit emotionally and has some psychological issues, which he chooses to ignore. Kelvin didn't see Rheya clearly on Earth, which causes problems for Rheya on Solaris, because she feels he remembered her wrongly. On the other hand, Kelvin on Solaris is willing to accept Rheya for what she is, whatever she is, because he needs her. The manipulation of memory to suit one's purpose is a dangerous thing on Solaris. Besides the issue of memory, Solaris brings up questions about the after life, death, guilt, and the thought of being accountable to the people we love and ourselves. Solaris is whatever was in the mind of the characters and the viewer. So, if you believe in reincarnation, you saw that flag in the film. I was glad there wasn't a clear cut answer at the end of the film, though I'm not sure after seeing Kelvin's finger heal, you don't know what's up at that point. I thought the pacing of the film did work. The question of what is real and what is memory and what is life and what is death, just seemed to go around in the film and gave the film a sense of suspended animation. Next, what was the purpose of Michael? When I first saw the film, I missed a quick glance of Michael on earth, being held by his father. Michael runs away from Kelvin the first time he encounters him on the spaceship, which may symbolize Kelvin's initial resistance of what Solaris was about, Kelvin was an intruder at that point. At the end of the film, we see the choice Kelvin makes and Michael takes his hand. Of course symbolically, you can see Michael as the arch angel, protector of heaven if that is where you were going with that character.The music was great, it was a wonderful character actor and I enjoyed the sounds. Watch the film again. Discuss it with someone. Thinking is good for you and no one should be disappointed in a film, and director that requires you to think. One more thing, I kept thinking about the rain and why did it keep raining on earth? Besides the spiritual aspects of water, rain has a tendency to distort vision and concentration. Oh yeah, Earth seemed to represent the monotony and repetition of life, so maybe the rain was like the drivel of becoming oblivious to daily function. No one on earth seemed to have any joy. Though everyone was in constant motion, traveling on trains, walking, etc, it seemed like no one was making progress. That's all I got. Bye!",

Sooner or later they will come to some more innovative ideas, since it is our human nature to entrap our minds with purely evanescent and mental unreal inexistent virtualities that we can real, but right now they are obsessed by this Space Odyssey. So the computer is no longer crazy. And we are not regressing back to fetal preexistence. We are floating away from what we may call life into some kind of beyond zone where time does not exist any more and where life is nothing but eternity, eternal timelessness. In other words we go beyond the alpha and the omega. We rant and rave into what was before the alpha and what will be after the omega, or so we think, so we think we remember, so we flatter our egos with pretending we know. The slow motion in this film, the lack of dialogue or even speech, the floating music in between two uncertain firm vaporous void shapeless inexistent non entity, everything makes us believe we are what we are and yet nothing but what we imagine we are because we can only be anything when we cease being at least according to our criteria of existence and saying what I am saying is already based on an illusion, is an illusion in itself, the illusion that anything I am saying right now has any consistence, existence, real essence. I am the illusion my very illusionary self is pretending to have and is calling life. We are nothing but some kind of conglomerate of particles whose existence is purely mathematical and what we call consciousness is nothing but some kind of chain reaction between these particles that cannot be controlled, dominated or simply identified. If there is one thing that is sure it is that we are in the whole universe the only animals who pretend to know the world and be conscious of our existence hence of our death since life does not exist if death does not, and we are not alive if we are not conscious of our death, even though we cannot be conscious of our death before being dead, and then life will be terminated. A vicious circle that Clooney locks around our eyes and brains and we fall in the trap and Solaris can finally eat up our sanity, leaving behind some bloody finger prints for the Scotland Yard officers who will investigate our disappearance in thin emptiness.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine & University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne",

This is a movie based on Stanislaw Lem's novel Solaris, and as such, much closer to the novel than Tarkovsky's movie. Tarkovsky could, at best, be said to be \"inspired by\" the novel. But comparing the two would be like comparing \"Star Trek: Insurrection\" to \"Apocalypse now\", simply because they were both inspired by the same novel (\"Heart of Darkness\").Those looking for a grand space opera, complete with laser beams going Whizz and space ships exploding with ear-deafening booms, are also in for disappointment. This is a drama, which happens to be set in a fairly distant future. As with the best of literary science fiction, it is about people, and about here and now, although the story works by introducing elements that we don't have in the world around us today.The pace is slow, the acting is brilliant, the story is powerful. And the title of my review compares it to \"2001\", since it tells us just how utterly, utterly alien an alien world will be.

            "content": "Science-fiction is one of those tough little genres that offers plenty to chew on in the form of content and ideas and yet you can have two extremely stark science fiction films; there are your Star Wars films and your films like Starship Troopers and Aliens that are able to tie in the war and romance genres, amongst others but then there are your more drawn out science fiction films such as 2001: A Space Odyssey which in themselves can be something spectacular whilst remaining ambiguous. Other films like Blade Runner and Alien can also use familiar narrative structures and yet are able to deliver on an entertaining and sophisticated level; at least to the masses, anyway.Solaris is a film made by Steven Soderbergh, a man who I am rapidly developing a split opinion of; Sex, Lies, & Videotape was brilliant as was Ocean's Eleven albeit for different reasons; this twinned with Traffic which I thought was slightly overrated and Ocean's Twelve which was a mere exercise of cinematography and star power, if anything. Solaris is probably Soderbergh's most interesting film but that isn't saying it's his best in fact it's far from his best. Solaris actually emphasises 2001: A Space Odyssey's brilliance as a sci-fi film but also reinforces the fact that art can sometimes be entertaining as well as eerie \u0096 Solaris may have been a bizarre and confusing film as 2001 was but it wasn't particularly eerie and at times at least to me, felt slow and dreary since I wasn't exactly sure as to what was going on.The film takes on a range of themes and attempts to reference previous sci-fi films from the past. The situation is straight out of Alien although the 'enemy' is a force that is not physical but psychological; Solaris also tries to use the idea of mental illness and psychological disturbance as its underlining theme since most of its character will suffer from hallucinations or seem to suffer from very random bouts of anger with pretty much the whole crew acting like they've got some horrible, dark secret locked away inside them. This actually moves me onto my next item: the hallucinations. It would seem that a massive ball of glowing energy is bringing back people from the crew's past lives and putting them on board with them in a sort of sick, Big Brother sort of a twist. This is where Solaris falters because Rheya (McElhone) and Chris (Clooney) begin to fall for one another yet again and the film quickly turns into a mere love story that's set in space with the bulk of these flash backs taking place on Earth; suddenly it's not so much a sci-fi as a character in a romance film having flashbacks.It's also worth noticing that within these flashbacks, there are numerous conversations between people and friends of Chris and Rheya about God and religion; this being significant since most of the flashbacks are these two peoples love stories. Flashing back to the present in space and Rheya herself says that she is 'unable to communicate with her creator' \u0096 is this suggesting Solaris itself is indeed God? That this ball of energy can create life? because we are never sure if Rheya is a hallucination or indeed, a clone. This energy ball can clearly read minds and recreate organisms from raw memory right down to the colour of the person's eyes and their accent. This is where Solaris works because it's challenging the viewer to work out why certain people or things are there and what they're purpose is. The reference of the quote being that Rheya can't communicate with her creator since we can't communicate with God and the Solaris energy ball puts her in the same situation.It's worth saying that Solaris does not cover a lot of what it is. The purpose of the space ship, the reason the types of people that are on board were selected in the first place and why more people aren't sent remains unanswered. Also, the massive ball of energy is never really utilized as an element in the film: it is the reason there even is a film since it enables Chris to reconcile with Rheya both on Earth and in Space; remember that no one ever thinks to investigate Solaris further. I said it earlier but it still counts: Solaris is not a great film of sorts and only emphasises 2001: A Space Odyssey's brilliance since Solaris is a basic love story with a bizarre twist in the way it looks and feels. It's premise is interesting as a detective story but ends up as and consequently falters as a love story that's actually already happened down on Earth. Solaris is a film for people who will enjoy a good 'trip' but just like most sci-fi's, should never be a film you'll just 'pop in to give a watch'.",

            "content": "Solaris is based on the Stanislaw Lem novel. Owning both the 1972 Tarkovsky movie and the Soderbergh version of Solaris, comparisons between the two films are inevitable. However, I think it is important to treat the two movies as individual films.The plot is based around a space station orbiting around the planet Solaris, where the astronauts and a security team have either gone missing or are not very coherent. One of the astronauts aboard the space station contacts psychiatrist Chris Kelvin (Clooney) who flies off to investigate. He soon discovers some amazing developments that offer him a second chance, and questions how far anyone will go to grab that chance.I feel that Soderbergh really couldn't win however he made this film. This may be deserved to a degree as remakes are notoriously easy to criticise, and very rarely a good idea. This is one remake that may have some justification, the original film is nearly three hours long, and the shorter version may encourage some viewers to seek out the Tarkovsky version as a result of watching, which has to be a good thing. This version could be viewed as a companion piece or an introduction of sorts to the Tarkovsky version, although it is a fine film in it's own right.Solaris is criticised at the same time for being boring, too short, too complicated, and too simplified. It is also derided for having two very good looking leading actors. At 90 minutes it never has time to become boring, and while the pace is never fast, the viewer must have a very short attention span to get even close to boredom. The character development is achieved by flashback, which in the important dream sequences makes perfect sense, and releases information slowly but very interestingly. Solaris needs to be watched closely to piece together all the threads of the plot, but is not overly complicated. Some information is kept to a minimum, the viewer has to make some assumptions and use some imagination, which may be a bridge to far for some. Clooney and Natascha McElhone make excellent leads in my opinion, and anyone who says that Clooney can't act should watch more of his films.The special effects are beautiful, but not overused. The sets and locations are very sparse and futuristic while still being recognisable and possible. The music by Cliff Martinez is excellent and captures the mood brilliantly.Overall Solaris is a very moody, almost hypnotic film that requires some effort. The acting and plot development grab you and means that you keep watching to see how things develop if someone is given a second chance, and the implications that it brings.",

The crew are studying a phenomenon known as Solaris and Kelvin is asked to join the remaining crew members to discover what is going on there and also to recover the remaining crew members - only two crew members remain on the space station as the other members of the crew have either committed suicide or simply disappeared - this includes the Security Task Force who were originally assigned to the task. What seems like a seemingly ordinary task for Kelvin soon proves difficult when he witnesses the phenomena of Solaris first-hand.Solaris markets itself as a film full of intrigue and mystery, but the reality here is that it isn't really any of these things. Here are some of the problems;For a start, all the characters are bland here with Doctor Snow starting every sentence with the words 'Hmmm' 'Yeah' 'Well' 'Hey'. He never has anything interesting or useful to say (although him being part of Solaris all along does explain why), but even so as a character he annoyed the hell out of me - he both sounded and looked like a stoner. Doctor Gordon was given very little screen time and as a result made very little impact on the film. Clooney and McElhone were sleepwalking through the film most of the time, but I think this was due to the dull script which clearly limited their performances. The dialogue was also dull and rather meaningless for the most part.The bulk of the film revolves around Kelvin and his wife Rheya (Natascha McElhone). The film flits between his memories of their time together and his existence with a carbon copy of his wife that has been created by Solaris. This could potentially have been interesting, but Soderbergh seemed more pre-occupied with giving the film long silly dream sequences which often contain little narrative content meaning that the film often seems pretentious rather than insightful or interesting. Another thing that angered me about the film is the sheer arrogance of the whole thing; I got the impression that Soderbergh genuinely believes that he's actually made something clever and thought-provoking when in reality that just isn't the case. I suppose the only thing that can really be taken away from this is that it asks the question 'If you had another chance to go back and put things right would you do it?', but this whole concept is tackled in such a boring manner that I just didn't really care by the end.It's no surprise that the critics mostly gushed over this as it's the sort of film that they can claim that they get because it's deep and meaningful and intelligent and that if you're thick you won't get it. All I'll say is that I did understand what the film was trying to say, but still thought that it was a pretentious load of baloney.",

            "content": "Based on the novel by Stanislaw Lem, this cerebral sci-fi yarn has psychologist Chris Kelvin (George Clooney) being sent to investigate strange happenings on a remote space station orbiting an odd planet. Kelvin has ghosts of his own to deal with, as he is haunted by memories of his wife, a suicide victim. His mission is to find out why the crew members have not come home and to explain their bizarre behavior (as evidenced by their plaintive messages imploring Kelvin to visit).There have been many movies that depict what happens when strange happenings are investigated, and as in most of those movies, nothing here is really as it seems. The tone for the tension and suspense is set almost immediately, as Kelvin awakes onboard the station next to his dead wife!Who is she? What is she? Is she really his wife, returned from the grave? What affect does Solaris the planet have on this.... this entitity? Is Kelvin turning as nutty as the remaining crew members? Is he hallucinating his wife? Is he even on the space station - is this a bad dream?\nDevoid of outlandish special effects and with a threadbare cast, the movie must lean on the solemn plot and the stoic acting of Clooney. This is his show all the way - his is the flawed hero and the willing victim combined into one multilayered character. It's some of Clooney's best work; he cannot rely on his whiplash smile or suave charm. Neither of those qualities, although surely valuable in other films, can help his character here.Like the best thinking-man's sci-fi, Solaris doesn't answer every question. It's mystical without being too abstract, and its quiet strength lies in what one doesn't see.The only drawback is that it's often tough to understand the actions of the crew members, including Kelvin. Are they insane, or merely acting? Hamlet himself may not have been able to discern the truth here. Compounding this is the sometimes unlikeability of Kelvin himself. It would be taking the easy way out, however, to have made him into some sort of superhero. Therefore even though it's tough at times to relate to Kelvin and consequently to root for him to succeed, this is a successful, well-made film, thanks to its complexities and multilayered main character.",

            "content": "(Small spoilers ahead)Proof that there's intelligent life out there \u0096 well, in the American cinema industry at least \u0096 arrives by the plateful with \u0091Solaris'. Imbued with a special vision and hallmarked throughout with a rare integrity, it's the kind of movie that makes you almost, but not quite forget, the catchpenny rubbish of Mel Gibson and \u0091Signs'.Unfortunately though, being intelligent is one thing, intelligible, quite another. And where this version of \u0091Solaris' is concerned, the eclipse of meaning is total.\u0091Solaris' is not, according to Soderbergh, a planet in the conventional sense. But an organism. An organism which draws upon the subconscious mind of those who come too close to it. (Andrei Tarkovsky played it the same way with his 1972 version, though at least as a film-maker battling against the Soviet regime he had a pretty good grasp on how mind-warping can ensue when one is drawn in too close to a monumental ideology).Soderbergh's organism, however, seems unrepresentative of anything at all. It exists. And whilst that's okay, scientifically speaking -- because organisms don't have to have a hidden agenda -- it's anything but okay, dramatically speaking. And that's the problem here: \u0091Solaris', meant to be a major presence in the movie, has no impact at all -\u0096 there's not a single Solaris PoV shot of the spacecraft hovering above it, not a single attempt to stamp its purpose, substance and identity upon the audience's consciousness.(Think back, if you will, to how Kubrick handled this kind of thing with HAL in 2001: A Space Odyssey -- the sudden HAL PoV shot, lip-reading the mouths of the astronauts, is as cinematically chilling as anything Hitchcock ever contrived).Here though, Solaris doesn't, er, do anything. Glimpsed through the spacecraft's windows, it changes colour, and in the closing sequence seems more vivid and more active than before. Why though is not explained: the organism simply \u0091is', so whether it's getting excited about preying upon human minds, or hyper-charged at the interaction of those minds with itself, is a non-sequitur: we don't know what it cares about, so we've nothing to care about, either.Little wonder, then, that Clooney is reduced to looking worried and confused and then even more worried and more confused, whilst McElhone pops up, or does not pop up, in sequences so reminiscent of \u0091Last Year In Marienbad' that you begin to wonder if Resnais, not Tarkovsky, was the director Soderbergh had in mind when embarking on this odyssey into what is real and what is not.That said though, what \u0091Solaris' certainly isn't is a cogent exploration of themes like love and hate, loss and redemption, or even religion and spirituality: though you sense Soderbergh and his producers would like to think \u0091Solaris' touches on all these, viewers less inclined to self-delusion will note that instead of some grand and enigmatic narrative arc, there is instead only a giant black hole here into which collapses all sense and all logic (the screenplay's conclusion isn't so much mysterious as woeful, inexplicable not in the sense that some great truths are carefully hidden within but inexplicable because Soderbergh cannot actually explain what point he he has been trying to make in the preceding, achingly-long 92 minutes).More worrying than that though is the way Soderbergh yet again seems incapable of improving upon an original: \u0091The Limey' wasn't merely one of the worst films of 1999, it was about as bad a remake as it's possible to achieve with source material as brilliant as \u0091Get Carter'. ..For older audiences, however, it's neither the Russian version nor anything by Resnais or Kubrick which is most likely to float clear of the subconscious at the conclusion of \u0091Solaris'. Rather, it's remembrance of sci-fi movie that scared the wits out of my generation of schoolkids -- the one in which the secrets of the mind came to knock at the doors of human existence.Forty-eight years on from the time it was made, Fred Wilcox's \u0091Forbidden Planet' still holds mesmeric sway: it had a tale to tell, and it knew exactly how to tell it. Would that \u0091Solaris' was worthy of a similar verdict.Rating: 7/10.",

It also suffers from what I call the 2001 malaise, that is an ending that is just as much subject to individual interpretation as it is a loose end that appears to need tying. An intellectual challenge? Only if one decides to make it so, and I was hardly inspired to do so.The (real) characters never appear to be in any actual physical danger. The only thing threatened is their ability to distinguish real from unreal etc. or figuring out a reason for the whole mess. This movie could have been aptly titled \"Confused.\" Considering how much of its running time is cluttered with filler love-making scenes and somewhat obscure fade backs, it could have been better done as a much shorter Twilight Zone episode where the uncertainty of an ending has always been at its best. Too much film wasted on facial closeups and not enough on a better evolution of the story line. The things that will stick with me longest about this movie is probably the hump on Natasha's nose.",

Solaris takes a stance, much the same way that Eternal Sunshine did a few years later, and claims that, in the end, the question doesn't matter. Although our memory is insufficient to construct our lives, human life, human resolve, human emotion is designed to \"make do\". Edited, shot, adapted and directed by Soderbergh, it is difficult to find any fault with Solaris at all. Clooney proves again why he is the current darling of quasi-indie directors.

            "content": "Being a Russian of Polish origin, i cannot but treat this film with a fair share of criticism. I'd like to point out two positive facts: 1) the makers of the film watched Tarkovsky's \"Solyaris\" (1972) VERY attentively, and they may have read the novel by Lem; 2) the makers managed to avoid the blockbuster stunts and special effects, which helped to preserve the atmosphere of the original novel. There is also a pleasant surprise - Clooney is certainly an adequate choice for the part of Chris; he has more than fine looks to offer though he also studied Banionis' Chris too attentively. Unfortunately, there is a drawback - in contrast with \"Solyaris\" (1972) the film has problems with holding the viewer's attention all the time; there are \"dropouts\", as it's hard to retain the same degree of concentration throughout the film. In this respect \"Solaris\" (2002) loses points to \"Solyaris\" (1972; Tarkovsky used symbols (like seaweed and the Breugel picture)just in the right places, so that they served both for relaxation and for reflection. I also wonder why the makers of the film decided to rename the characters - why did Khari become Rheya? why did Sartorius and Snauth give way to Snow and Gordon? Why on earth was the all-male crew of Lem's novel transformed and included an Afro-American woman never mentioned in the original? Is it impossible to shoot a film without an Afro-American on the cast as it is wrong from the point of view of political correctness, and the author may go to hell?In spite of all these drawbacks, I'd like to say that the film seems to continue the chain of problems raised in Tarkovsky's \"Stalker\". There the main characters went to the Zone to find a room where all the most cherished wishes could come true. In \"Stalker\" the characters reach the room, but they don't enter, as they do not know which of their wishes will be granted by the Zone, they don't know whether the dark side of their nature will be revealed or not.They do not trust themselves and have no faith. \"Solaris\" (2002) may be telling us to learn to trust. The giant thinking planet acts as God restoring the long-dead beloved and granting wishes. Do you remember that at the end Rheya says that everything has been pardoned and that what was does not matter anymore? So if gods give us presents having searched our souls, shall we doubt and send back the gifts?",

I have seen the latter and although it has some excellent moments it is a very self indulgent movie for the Director I suspect. It is a fantastic piece of cinema in some aspects, but rambling and tortuously slow at some points. Therefore in my opinion a remake was certainly a good idea to make the story more accessible to people that would not watch, or have not seen this movie.In respect of Solaris 2002, I found this to be an excellent movie. Clooney puts in a mainly good and emotive performance, which is fundamental to the story line. People have decried Jeremy Davies performance, but I think he was playing a bizarre character hence acts well... bizarrely! Viola Davis is also very good in the slightly smaller part of Helen Gordon. In my opinion Natascha McElhone steals the film though as the haunting yet enchanting Rheya.So what is the movie about? I'll try and cover this without giving too much away about the plot. Well the story covers many things, and although it is put forward as a science fiction movie the science takes a back seat in the main. For me it was principally a romance, and a story of unrequited love. Given the choice would we step back into the past and try and live things again. It is also to a lesser extent philosophising about what makes us human, and if we aren't human does it matter? (in a similar way to Blade Runner) So two fairly deep topics. I would stress that this movie is not for everyone, but if you like carefully played romance, and philosophy with a twist, you may like this movie.Also of note is the soundtrack written by Cliff Martinez which provides a very good extra dimension to the film, and accompanies the interplay with Chris and Rheya beautifully.For me, 5 out of 5.

            "review_title": "Experimental Effort, But An Utter Failure",
            "content": "In his many years as a director, Steven Soderbergh has always had the desires to go beyond how other directors get their pictures done. He takes risks that others wouldn't dare to. He also remains loyal to his independent origins and takes liberation towards making them provocative albeit eccentric. And though his motives are not problematic and his experimentations deserve some sort of applause, but like all good scientists, some experiments don't always go as planned. \"Solaris\" is one of those films that is very daring in its intentions, however, it's quite lumbering and dreary in its delivery.Starring the always cordial George Clooney, who sacrificed his perky charms in exchange for an eternally drab character, the green backgrounds from \"Solaris\" has similar vides to another, more successful Soderbergh picture \"Traffic\". The whole cinematography behind is immaculate. The camera work is handled with caare a percision to create the correct atmosphere. The problem is that the gloominess is quite overkill and doesn't offer anything uplifting or spontaneous and feels that remaining gloomy is a symbol of artistic intelligence.Clooney stars as Dr. Chris Kelvin, a widowed therapist who willingly follow the same dreary path of existence everyday in the future not that far behind as I speak. He may wear stylish clothes, but his television looks archaic even for 2002 standards. While basking in his melancholic ways, he gets interrupted by a colleague of his named Dr. Gibarian (Ulrich Tukur) who resides at a space station near the planet Solaris summons him to come forward right away because something urgent is happening though we'll only know what's happening once Chris arrives.When Kelvin arrives at the space station, blood stains strangely start to materialize and if that's not strange enough, crew members had all except for two died off from suicide, including Gibarian himself. The two survivors include a demented, but amusing man named Snow (Jeremy Davies) who's really not reliable of information. The other survivor is Dr. Helen Gordon (Viola Davis) is even less outgoing.In reality, their taciturn ways is just a figure of speech by ways of storytelling. Anything remotely outgoing for them will very likely get them out of their comfort zone. We don't want that now don't we? The station has a macabre possession where deceased love ones start to manifest. In Kelvin's case it was his deceased wife Rheya (Natascha McElhone). It seems that the mysterious planet that's being studied, might actually be the planet istelf studying the humans. By doing that it seems to go into a person's dreams and create duplicates of the people who are in their dreams.The idea seems very weird, and it's no surprise that Soderbergh wanted to direct this kind of film. It also caught the eyes of Russian film director Andrei Tarkovsky in 1972 who made an equally sluggish movie adapted from the novel by Polish author Stanislaw Lem. And sure the film reflects upon the subject matters of life. Death, grief, redemption, and neddiness, it just feel like it filmed in a boiler room. It has Kubrick intention in terms of subject matter and keeps its distance from the audience.There really isn't much of a sci-fi story, instead we get a love story, bombarded with illusionary manifestations, backed up by a myriad of flashbacks, and plenty of space inclined dialogue. The worst aspect of the dialogue is that someone speaks and then they pause for a long time. It's as though they either forgot their lines or that Soderbergh deliberately made them pause between conversations. It just makes the slow and heavy-handed movie all the more labouring.Soderbergh's script never really moves the settings very much and we don't really explore the surroundings of the planet. Kelvin's deceased wife has came back from the dead (or is she?). There is nothing raptus about it, or anything joyous either. It's just a barrage of questions regarding Rheya's existence. She might be a cloned duplicate of Rheya, but in reality it's not Rheya which adds nothing but confusion ad nauseum. The intense situation is neither relieving or happy, but more leanient toward philosophical and theoretical in its intentions. When he glazes into her existance, he question his own level of sanity and see if he can piece something together for all this to make any logic behind it. The end result is both revolting and mundane.It all results in a very trance inducing predicament that will likely get viewers to become very impatient rather fast. It doesn't help that the score by Cliff Martinez is one-note and uninspiring. There will be times when a person will gaze at the window and notice a red thing swirling which was to be Solaris. The window scenes are the only outdoor moments we will find in \"Solaris\" which makes the whole movie so isolated and grounded. The strange thing is that in spite of \"Solaris\" being a big-budgeted movie, there is really nothing that shows it.",

Just look at the poster...I feel if the cast were believable, (stop putting Clooney in non rom com roles that's all he can do) the script was written properly, and the direction was good this could have been a good adaptation but for me it's just a weak effort. If you're not going to portray Lem's vision of the living planet itself as one of the main characters then why even bother?",

            "content": "I congratulate producer James Cameron and Steven Soderberg for deciding to film Stanislaw Lem's book. I congratulate Soderberg for being more intelligent than George Lucas and company who reduced Hollywood science fiction in space to literally loud films for the aural senses and special effects feasts for the visual senses. And yet...what a disaster Soderberg's Solaris turned out to be!!If you liked this film see Andrei Tarkovsky's film made 30 years ago when most moviegoers around the world thought Russians only made third rate propaganda war movies.Tarkovsky's film gripped you in so many ways that Soderberg cannot. Tarkovsky's choice of Bach's music \"Chorale in F minor\", his casting of the brilliant Estonian actor Yuri Jarvet (Grigori Kozintsev's choice of King Lear that had Lord Laurence Olivier doffing his cap) as Dr Snauth a character Soderberg tried to recreate ineffectively in Snow (Jeremy Davis), Tarkovsky's brilliant visuals (Soderberg does copy the rain on the windows)--give you sufficient reasons to realize that Andrei Tarkovsky remains one of the finest filmmakers of the century--a filmmaker who most moviegoers do not adequately know about in the US and elsewhere.What amused me is that before the film was released there were the publicity about how Soderberg wanted to make the film as one superior to Tarkovsky. Soderberg is no Tarkovsky and will never be.Tarkovsky did not use nudity to make his film sell--his film has made waves even when the Communists were afraid of Tarkovsky's messages and suppressed his work in the Seventies in many ways--all because of the care he took with the direction, the script, the editing, the photography and the music. His script, so different from that of the Soderberg film, delivered more punch without a Clooney and his fabulous voice. Hollywood's answer to Tarkovsky is probably the late Orson Welles and in recent times, Terrence Mallick. Cameron probably knew his limitations as a director and cleverly opted to produce the movie. Soderberg thought he was bigger than he is and attempted to remake Tarkovsky's work without even acknowledging the work of the Russian genius in the few press statements I came across.If the Soderberg film appeals to you, it is Stanislaw Lem that gets you not Soderberg. While the film is better than the average Hollywood product this film does not stand up to great cinema elsewhere in any department save for the above-average sound editing.",

Many pseudo-intellectuals dismissed the film as a \"second chance at love\". The main theme of the film is the exploration of the meaning of relationships. Chris Kelvin (Clooney) while on a space station circling the newly found planet Solaris is \"visited\" by a flesh & blood facsimilie of his dead wife Rheya (Natasha McElhone). She isn't a dream nor is she simply an alien disguised as her. She is a mirror of his memories of his wife--HIS memories. This is the theme of the film: what are our relationships but for our memories of what has already happened? How much can we really know a person? How much can we approximate how another person feels, how things feel to their touch, how things smell to them? The \"visitor\" replica of Rheya is a conglomeration of Chris' memories of her--but that is just how she begins \"life\". The Visitor Rheya is conscious of what is happening & knows she isn't really Rheya & makes Chris aware if this, yet he still cannot let her go as the love that he felt during his troubled marrige has come back & its a feeling he can't abandon easily. Which also begs the question what is the meaning of love?SOLARIS is a beautifully made, well acted, moody film THAT IS NOT A REMAKE. Like the 1972 Russian film by the great Tarkovsky, it is based on the novel of the same name by the Polish writer Stanislav Lem. The dimwits who don't understand the subtlties of Soderberg's film have given themselves a pass by dismissing it as a \"bad remake\". If all one gets from seeing Soderberg's adaptation of Lem's novel is that it is a \"second chance at love\" story then there is NO WAY they ever saw Tarkovsky's 3 1/2 hour snail paced film. Chances are they never saw 2001: A SPCE ODYSSEY either but they probobly read a lot of reviews so that they can bullsh*t their way through a discussion of it.",

Soderbergh basically takes one of the most intriguing sci-fi novels available, removes everything that makes it interesting and presents the viewer with a massively tedious love story. Instead of subtle humour, there's a comic relief techie. Instead of filosophic speculation, there are countless closeups on Natascha McElhones face.The ending really says it all. The novel ends with Kelvin sitting at Solaris' shores, touching the immense and silent gelatinous beast, feeling that some kind of understanding may be possible.

            "content": "The trouble with trying to film Lem's story ( rather too short to call a novel ) is that the events are all \"internal\" and subjective. There is almost nothing \"external\" or objective to depict. Why then try to make a movie of it? I am of the opinion that Tarkovsky ( you'll pardon the spelling ) did it because he wanted to make a science-fiction movie to compare with Kubrick's 2001 of four years earlier. In that he undoubtedly failed, producing a sprawling undisciplined behemoth that compensated for the lack of action with a surfeit of to-camera monologues. That he unconsciously aspired to the KJubrickesque is revealed by his preoccupation with the circular motif that was the visual signature of 2001, the space station depicted in Bob McCall's poster for the movie. Yet, whereas that wheel in space corresponded to the engineering requirements for the centrifugal simulation of gravity, in the Tarkovsky version, the circularity of the space station has no meaningful relevance whatsoever ( the floors are perpendicular to the direction in which gravity would be simulated ). It is, rather, a kind of stylistic Freudian slip, echoing the influence of Kubrick's masterpiece on the Russian wannabe.Why would Soderbergh choose to re-make the story? Possibly, by relay, there is an echo of Tarkovskies motivation, in that the Russian's movie, for all it's inadequacies, has been hailed a classic in the west. Maybe Soderbergh was drawn to that. But maybe he was also interested in those very themes which make the story so challenging to enact. Maybe he also falls into the same trap. But, whereas the earlier version relied on talk, here the drama is conveyed entirely in another medium, also not visual, yet entirely cinematic: the score.Cliff Martinez' score is undoubtedly the star of the movie without which it would be almost nothing. The music is an accomplished pastiche of compositions by John Adams, Philip Glass and, appropriately, Gyorgi Ligeti. I had not noticed Martinez' music for Sex Lies and Videotape or Traffic. I really cannot remember it. But I love the monumental quality of John Adams' music, and here Martinez has copied that to breathtakingly emotive effect. In particular, it is the use of gigantic floating chords that characterises John Adams' most dramatic work,a kind of aural surf repeatedly breaking in a suspended, ever imminent crescendo like a musical tsunami. This technique Martinez borrows in a number of scenes, even introducing wind instruments into what is a predominantly string sound-scape. The effect is to paint in the drama of shifting emotions that no one can either see or make visible. This he couples and juxtaposes with the excitement provided by his bright, high-temp rhythmic line. The effect makes the movie.The supporting star of the movie is the design of the sets. The steel and alloy effects are highly technical, impersonal yet not harsh or intrusive. However, we again find a further continuation of the circular motif echoed down the decades from Kubrick's 2001. Here those circles are every bit as meaningless in engineering terms as they were in the Tarkovsky version. And in all the various other sci-fi movies where spaceships are designed in the circular by people with no grasp of engineering or any understanding why the structures in Kubrick's timeless vision are that way.The movie at hand seriously lets itself down at the very end when it seems to trip into some kind of superficial religious clich\u00e9: \"Everything is forgiven\" indeed!",

This isn't a movie for idiots or those looking for the next \"Terminator\". Some movies aspire towards something more, and this movie is one of them. Thank God for Soderbergh.  He writes, directs, edits, and does the cinematography.  You don't need an army to make a great film, just a sober, mindful, skillful artist.

The story was brought to life by Soviet director Andrei Tarkovsky in 1972. I saw Tarkovsky's version for the first time recently, and it blew me away. I actually prefer it to its Western counterpart, 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968). So I was curious about how a remake of Tarkovsky's film would hold up.Steven Soderbergh's 2002 version of Solaris doesn't have a lot wrong with it, but throughout I kept asking why the remake was necessary. The original is good enough, why do we need a new one? A desire for a shorter film? A preference not to read subtitles? An old inclination to boycott communism? Such reasons sound lazy or silly to me. At its core we have an intriguing and resonant story of a protagonist who is forming a sick emotional attachment to an illusion, but it's nothing we haven't seen before. All Soderbergh really adds are some extra scenes with the psychologist and his wife on Earth, with glimpses of George Clooney's butt. On a side note, the planet Solaris itself looks dull to me in this version, turned an unimaginative blue and purple. I'm not automatically against any remake. I actually enjoyed King Kong (2005), but that film sufficiently re-imagined the story (better love story, scarier natives, etc.) to be worthwhile. Again, Solaris (2002) doesn't have a lot of problems, but is mainly redundant.",

(Recent examples include \"Gattaca\" and \"AI: Artificial Intelligence,\" films I admired that achieved something less than blockbuster status). Such is the case with Steven Soderbergh's \"Solaris,\" which extends a concept that might have driven the plot of a Star Trek episode to feature-film length. That \"Solaris\" feels longer than its 99-minute running time is not necessarily a bad thing. It's a philosophical movie that eschews action, effects and violence, and is content to linger on moments and details as it considers its trenchant themes.I can't say too much without giving anything away. The setup is that Dr. Kelvin (played by Soderbergh favorite George Clooney) is summoned to a space station where some sort of disaster has occurred. (Imagine how \"2001\" might have played out if Heywood Floyd's Clavius Base cover story had been true, and you'll get the idea). Shortly after arriving on the Solaris base, Clooney meets the survivors, and soon understands why they don't want to leave.Soderbergh directs efficiently, and the performances by Clooney, Natascha McElhone, Viola Davis, Jeremy Davies, and Ulrich Tukur all resonate. Soderbergh's use of visual effects is economical and discreet, and never detracts from the story (based on Stanislaw Lem's 1961 novel of the same name). I haven't seen the 1972 Russian film also based on Lem's novel, but this version inspires me to seek it out.\"Solaris\" asks us to consider many questions: What would we do if given a chance to relive the past? How important is memory to our concepts of our loved ones? Would we choose a false happiness over the ups and downs of reality? \"Solaris\" uses a futuristic setting to explore these questions eloquently and profoundly, leaving the viewer to supply the answers.

A movie, even one intended to provoke thought and debate, shouldn't rely on its basis for enjoyment. I had never read Clockwork Orange, a Batman comic or Ring, but I enjoyed all those movies a great deal.It must be said that the ideologies presented in this film were immense. The notions of regret, second chances and fear of the unknown were skillfully put forward, especially the philosophy that a physical manifestation of an object or being, no matter how accurate, isn't necessarily the object it represents. Rheya questioning this and Chris' refusal to debate it due to his scientific values was the highlight. Unfortunately, outside of this scene, Solaris lacks anything. Character, progression and empathy. Chris is almost emotionless and this renders his character (a low point for Clooney) isolated from empathy. There is no spark between him and the audience. Rheya is dull and undesirable, hence uncomfortable to watch for too long. There is no standout performance in Solaris. The idea of regret and second chance in a science fiction film (the deepest and most thought provoking genre) seems dangerously trivial in comparison to values in Bladerunner, 2001, Invasion of the Bodysnatchers among others. Overall, Solaris is a huge disappointment. There is no climax and the film is far too slow moving to incite any interest.

When the credits started rolling the only thing that popped in my head was \"So?\"...When I went to watch this film, I was expecting something slower and more \"dramatic\" than a full out Sci-fi thriller. I read the reviews, but still kept an open mind, since like I mentioned before I like \"thinking\" movies...\nSo I sit down and the film starts. No title credits. At first I thought that it was the projector's screw up, but incidentally the film is supposed to start like that. Ok. Doesen't really affect the film in my oppinion, but at least its a way to already grab the interest of some people. So i became intrigued. But then after 20 minutes of monotonous dialogue and events, I was allready looking at my watch. The film was unfortunately extremely boring. Nothing really happened. It did manage to capture my attention at some parts, even to the point that I was once again intrigued and hoping that the film would suddenly take off and things would actually happen at a regular pace.I understand some people enjoy slow movies, and I also have no problem with films that decide to take a slower pace to build characters and reveal plot at key moments instead of grand-slam action with big breasted women donning two hand held cannons, blowing aliens to pieces in order to save humanity from an onslought of alien invaders... (Though I do like those movies too. :D) But, this film was slower than slow. I mean, you can even hear the actors deliberatly spacing their words in order to drag out the conversation. Much like \"Can...You...Get.....(shot of Solaris)........That?\" This was too much to bear for me, but I managed to watch the movie to its completion. Even though I nodded off a couple of times, only to wake up and see that the main character hasn't even finnished his first sentence yet.Then theres the whole point of the film. Yes, its a thinking persons film. In a way. But if you manage to stay awake, its not really that hard to figure out. There are no clear answers given, but through out the conversations, you get the idea what they're talking about.: \"What is being human?\" \"Human, Clone, alien, does it really matter?\" \"What makes you, YOU?\" \"Are you only a compilation of memories, residing in a physical body, thus proving that an individual is a sum of his upbringing and surrounding? Or do you have soul, with a predetermined fate, created by a diety?\" \"Or are we all just someones dream?\" The film poses some great conversation topics. But the film doesen't really express them too well in my oppinion. It doesen't smack you in the face as if they're going \"See?! This is how it is!!!\" its more like \"Well... It could be this... Or this... Or perhaps that... uh... What do you think?\"In my oppinion thinking movies should pose a lot of questions, but they should also try to answer some of them sometimes. Its easy to pose questions in film. (Basically look at the monolith in 2001: A Space Oddesey. Kubrick intentionally left it without explenation. He wanted people to be totally confused) It's harder to answer them... And thats when films like \"The sixth Sense\" shine. They pose interesting questions, AND THEY ANSWER THEM! *Shock* *horror* How could this be? Well, because the writer thought it out. He realised that its a lot more fulfilling that a film actually does a bit of the cerebral work on behalf of the audience, so that they can atleast enjoy the film. Films that usually lack answers are usually met with more scorn than films that do have answer. I'm not saying that all films that lack answers are bad. I'm just saying that sometimes, when a film poses so many questions, and doesen't even ATTEMPT to answer any of them, audiences feel cheated.Solaris did not have any personal stand point. It didn't have any of its own oppinions on the questions it itself asks. And I'm not talking about questions like \"What is Solaris?\" I'm talking about the \"Humanity questions\" The things this film basically was about. They should have atleast tried to prove something. Not just post questions. So when the credits rolled I was \"So? What does it mean to be human?\"The film does make you think. And it is filmed very well. Solaris is beautiful. And the base is creepy and lonely. But the dialogue. The pacing, the actual flow of the film was lacking.Oh well, this movie was a dissapointment in my oppinion. But sometimes when they try to score a hit, they miss...",

            "content": "Solaris is a powerful film about the nature of what it means to be human. The acting is good, but the cinematography is especially amazing. The camera jitters a little while filming, and the sets are not brightly lit and clear, which works well to give a visceral sensation of \"being there\". So it was a moving experience for me, and I'm glad I saw the film.Unfortunately, there were some flaws. Compressing such a large story into a regular length film glossed over some details (how far away is Solaris from Earth?), and the pacing was somewhat slow at times. Like Memento, this is a brainy movie that you have to be paying attention to \"get it\" throughout the film. I actually prefer that.Solaris is not really a science fiction film. It's really a ghost story mystery like The Sixth Sense, although science elements are present in the background. I was really set to love this film, and was definitely captivated throughout, but without spoiling any of the plot I can tell you that the ending left me very unsatisfied. This makes it unlike The Sixth Sense which came with a snappy, clever ending that wrapped up all the mystery but retained the power of the film. This is the main reason I gave the film a low-ish rating even though I did find it moving and well-produced. It was the story that disappointed me.Who should see this film:-- arty types, definitely-- science fiction fans, well, I can't stop you. It won't hurt too much. Save it for a rainy day. But not if you hated 2001: A Space Odyssey, which was much more substantive than Solaris.-- anyone from an Eastern European culture who wants to see some famous literature on the big screenI'll give Solaris a 6 out of 10. Oh, and don't rent the old film Solyaris, which is vastly slow paced and only for the most arty.",

On the other hand, if you have insomnia, Solaris may be the answer.Solaris is a remake of a Russian film from the early 70s. I haven't seen the original. Jeremy Davies as one of the two crew members does the worst job of over-acting in my long-term memory. He constantly waves his hands around. What an annoying actor.As a big fan of Stanley Kubrick I take objection to any comparison of Solaris to 2001. They don't compare. 2001 was an original and a landmark in the history of film.

In the science fiction genre I can only think of \"2001\" and maybe \"Blade Runner\" in the same league. All of these three movies are relatively slowly paced, with an emphasis on philosophical and spiritual questions rather than action and suspense. I must admit that I was rather unsure about Soderbergh's \"remake\". Even though I think he is a decent director, I have never really understood those who regard him as a genius. The fact that James Cameron is one of the producers didn't exactly calm me down. I often find his movies painfully shallow and silly.It turns out that this is a very fine movie, indeed. Not quite on the level of Tarkovsky's, but not far from it. Tarkovsky's main emphasis is on philosophical questions, but Soderbergh chooses to shift it over to the love story, which probably makes this film easier to relate to for a lot of people, but also slightly less interesting in my opinion. However, it is beautifully told and overall well acted. Clooney does a very decent job as Kelvin. Nasthascha McElhone is fine as Rheya (although I have to admit that there is something about her appearance that I really don't like). But the most impressive acting is done by Jeremy Davies which creates a really strange character. If you manage to watch this movie to the end you may understand just why he behaves so strangely :-)",

It always jumped out at me so I decided to get it on DVD.The movie is about a psychiatrist who gets a strange video message from his friend asking him to go up to a space station called Solaris to investigate some strange happenings.I did like this movie, but it was very slow. This movie went at a very steady pace all the way through. There was no action, there was no heart racing moments. This is a space drama. There are lots of dialogue and lots of flashbacks from when he was still on Earth. You will need to really concentrate on this film to fully understand it.The movie stars George Clooney, Natascha McElhone, Viola Davis & Jeremy Davies. The acting was very good throughout. Everyone did a great job. The emotions that these guys are feeling was very well played out. I can imagine that if I was going through what they are going through it would be very emotional and confusing\u0085 and that is what I was getting from every one of these actors.This is not the best sci-fi film I have ever seen. Personally I prefer a film to have a little bit of action, or at least a bit of suspense to keep me gripped. I did not get bored watching this, but as I said before, because it is a very slow moving movie, it is easy to get distracted. It is like watching someone reading you a story. It is a very good story, but it felt like it was missing something.Visually it was very beautiful in places. I love space movies anyway. I always think the stars and space looks beautiful, so when it is made well in film I find it very fascinating and awesome. The planet that Solaris was near looked very pretty. The colours and effects used to make it were brilliant. I could sit and watch that for ages.All in all this film was not brilliant\u0085 it is a good story, but very slow. Make sure if you watch this it is completely silent and you can concentrate on it 100% otherwise you might miss part of the plot and not understand a thing that is going on.I will give this movie 6 out of 10.\"Or maybe you're my puppet.

            "content": "7.5 out of 10For all the hype thrown upon George Clooney's derriere and the film's lack of mainstream appeal, Steven Soderbergh's remake of Stanislaw Lem's classic novel is a worthy venture.  George Clooney stars as Chris Kelvin, a psychologist who, upon a request from a friend, heads to a space station orbiting the planet Solaris.  On board, he discovers his friend and another man dead, as well as two survivors, Snow (Jeremy Davies) and Gordon (Viola Davis).  But most startlingly, his deceased wife, Rhea (Natasha Mcelhone) re-appears on the space station, not knowing how she arrived or where she came from.  Kelvin is shocked, and believes Solaris itself may have been responsible for her \"resurrection.\"  He and the remaining crew question if this \"copy\" is even a human being, but he sees her reappearance as a chance for redemption.This mixture of sci-fi and drama isn't as successful as either Contact or 2001, but it's an intelligent, thoughtful drama with intriguing concepts and theories.  The performances are good, especially Clooney and Mcelhone, who develop just enough chemistry to make a believable couple.  The film pays a little too much focus toward the past relationship between Kelvin and his wife (the direction during some of these scenes is sometimes rather indulgent), and not quite enough speculation on what Solaris is.  But the film is smart and engaging, daring enough to question our perception of humanity and how we judge a person's existence, capping off with a nicely ambiguous ending that's sure to spark much discussion.  Similar to Spielberg's A.I., I see a more positive response from audiences in the future.",

Personally I consider this movie to be an insightful love story with the milieu of Science as the platform. This definitely requires attention to value the context.The story begins with the central character Chris (George Clooney), a psychiatrist distressed by the loss of his wife Rheya (Natascha McElhone). Shortly a call from his friend/scientist lands him on a space station to a far of planet called Solaris, to investigate some bizarre occurrences which led to death and disappearance of some crew members. The story begins when Chris starts seeing his deceased wife onto the research station and tries to correlate the situation along with delusion.I think appreciation should go to Soderbergh for choosing the cast so effectively, who had morphed into the characters through a seamless transition. The chemistry between the two key characters is what made the movie so enjoyable. I think Jeremy Davies also pulled up his part pretty much well. Soundtrack used had some kind of appeal which is very hard to put across in words. Presence of James Cameron as Producer also refined the overall quality of the movie, especially if I emphasis on the production set and the special effects deployed.This is a movie which will not appeal to the universal viewers but to those who have loved movies like 2001: A Space Odyssey as well as 2009's Moon.

Psychologist Chris Kelvin is pleaded by old friend Gibarian, to fly from earth to space station Prometheus, where something terrible has happened. Prometheus orbits around the beautifully enigmatic planet Solaris. On arrival, Kelvin discovers scattered blood and two bodies, along with the only two survivors; Gordon and Snow. Solaris is a hushed, introspective film on the boundaries of human mental stability, isolation, loss, existence, the power of a high being, and emotional withdraws of letting go. Images and silence speak louder than words; echoing 2001: A Space Oddessy, where piercing stares tell all that is needed. The mystery of Solaris lies upon the enigmatic planet, Soderbergh only supplying little hints and clues leading to what is behind this majestic planet; strengthening the fact this demands repeat views and open thinking. The emotional drama is gripping, as Kelvin is haunted on the apparition of his deceased wife, flashes of Kelvin's memories during his time with Rheya, and the unseen visitors of Gordon and Snow. Much to the vast cold of space, Solaris seeps a coldness from its core, that bars an emotional detachment. A haunting ambiance lacking in spine chilling. Not completing the emotional bridge, a central presence of George Clooney, holds a gravitas to the proceedings. Natascha McElhone doesn't reach Clooney's presence yet haunting as Rheya. Viola Davis and Jeremy Davies as the remaining survivors are great in their supporting roles. Solaris may not be everyones brand of Scince Fiction, on its conclusion, your need to talk about it is quite strong, which is the films overall point.",

Event Horizon and Sphere are a couple of good examples of such a combination. However, Solaris tries and fails to do likewise and subsequently ends up being a salad bowl of different elements, and not a melting pot.It introduces Kelvin, a renowned and respected psychologist who received a distress call from a space station marooned out in deep space (The movie is set in an unspecific future), requesting his presence due to a 'problem' on board. On arriving, Kelvin meets a crew member who is as cryptic as he is strange, who points him in the direction of another member who is scared but harsh and defensive to Kelvin. However, after events subsequently take a disturbing psychological turn the mission becomes a quest to regain sanity.What is clear once a substantial part of the movie has been and gone is that this movie incorporates aspects of Event Horizon, Sphere, 2001 Space Odyssey and Jacob's Ladder - unfortunately none of them are remotely convincing. The problem is the nauseating dullness of the film - there was an opportunity here to really mix these elements and contrive something original, exciting, gripping, thought provoking and dramatic, and yet the direction turns it into a slow, ponderous love affair with itself.\nThe dialogue is also a problem as it is so uninteresting - half way through the proceedings and we just don't care what is going on.Confusing flashbacks (Or are they), baffling camera movements and a general lack of clarity serve to frustrate rather than entertain.The performances are merely staple, with only Clooney being decent.

It's a psychological drama about love and death, reality and dreams.\nBased on Polish writer Stanislaw Lem's philosophical 1961 novel, and a remake from the 1972 Andrei Tarkovsky's film. \"Solaris\" is a hypnotic mind twister, a meditation on the nature of being and humanity.Steve Soderbergh wrote, directed, photographed and edited \"Solaris\", altering Lem's story to focus more on the romantic relationship. He shows us in flashbacks how Kelvin and Rheya met and fell in love and the events leading to her death. These are the warm elements of an ultimately chilly tale. Soderbergh makes the opening scenes loo crisp, cool and evocative in a way that reminds us of a Stanley Kubrick film. \"Solaris\" easily ranks in with Soderbergh's finer works such as \"Traffic\", \"Out of Sight\", and \"Sex, Lies, & Videotape\", and is just as experimental as \"Full Frontal\" but more essential!!\"",

Here, Soderbergh departs from the source material and wisely concentrates on the relationships between his characters rather than the philosophical concerns that grounded Tarkovsky's film. But the material remains perhaps too daunting for modern audiences, with George Clooney (rapidly becoming one of our most introspective actors) as a psychiatrist who travels to a space station surrounding a mysterious planet that sends emissaries representing the troubled pasts of the station's inhabitants; in Clooney's case, it's the apparition of his suicide wife (Natascha McElhone) that rekindles his dormant but conflicted emotions. Although it's clearly a personal film for Soderbergh about the ephemeral nature of interaction, it's unfortunately not compelling enough to be little more than another experimental challenge for him (as studied and careful as `Full Frontal' was spontaneous and indulgent), albeit a beautifully shot one (filmed, as usual, by the director under the pseudonym Peter Andrews; he also edited the film as Mary Ann Bernard) with a production design by Philip Messina that pays subtle homage to Tarkovsky's original.",

Made by an acclaimed director which is first of all a movie addict, this movie is Steven Soderbergh's gift to every people that shares with him a true passion for cinema. And nobody else. The general audience will hate it - slow paced, slow acted and slow all the way, the movie is almost like a play, tightfully enclosed in its capsule. But these few characters, these few situations are only an apparent face for an overwhelming reality - emotions are the sheer canvas of this picture. The story is so simple it reaches the most minimalistic heights in an american movie since Kubrick went into space - Dr. Chris Kelvin (Clooney) is sent to a space station near gas planet Solaris to investigate the strange occurences on it and to rescue the remainder of the crew. But when he arrives, it's clear that this is no simple bail-out mission and soon he will know that the reasons to return are far more difficult to find than the reasons to stay. The movie ends up being a strikingly lensed space drama, with the freshness of some choices (the fact that the movie has so few characters and only 93 minutes gives it a mood that is based on essence). And its simplicity is its greatest asset. Some would consider a remake of Tarkovski's work pure heresy. But Soderbergh suceeds in paying his respects, and accomplishes what every remake should be - a new insight into a known movie. A true tour de force, and a proof that when there is a will to stay out of the studio system and its sometimes corruptive formulae, there is also a way.",

The film asks many questions and hardly answer any. Which is no problem for me, I do like the occasional anti-Hollywood type film that doesn't force us a nightly tied ending. But here it doesn't quite work in my opinion. Somewhere halfway through the film you figure out what is going on. And then you expect another twist because hey...we're only halfway! But that twist doesn't (really) happen. And so the second half of the film becomes just a bunch of actors talking about \"it\". In general I'm a fan of Clooney, but I found him quite pale and uninteresting here. McElhone does a better job. Final verdict: not really worth your time.",

It's what Science Fiction used to be before special effects became all the rage in the late 70's and 80's.     Many who have commented on it call it cerebral or intellectual.  Those are both very accurate words to describe it.  If you liked 2001, or some of the older science fiction from the 60's and 70's, I think you will enjoy this film.  The hardware is very realistic, but isn't shown off.  The vehicles remind me of Space: 1999.  The CGI effects of the planet / entity (Solaris) are incredibly beautiful and the score is eerily perfect.  The cinematography is really something.This version of Mr. Lem's novel has a few twists at the end that I think make this one actually better that the original Solyaris.  Almost a 'Sixth Sense' kind of twist that will pull a lot of things together - someone isn't who (or what) you think they are.  There were some parts of the original Solyaris that made it drag way too long in parts.  This version - while still slow gets to the point quicker.  You really have to pay attention because much of the heart of the story is told through flashbacks / dreams, and the main character's mental exhaustion can confuse things quite a bit. \nIf you have to have big special effects, phaser battles, lots of explosions - this film is definitely not for you.  If you not only liked 2001, but also actually understood it, I think you will like this story even better in some respects.  For those that have commented that there is no plot and it doesn't make sense - it's not Mr. Lem's or Mr. Soderbergh's fault that you don't get it.Anyone who has lost someone very important to them should definitely understand the heart of this story.

Rheya's dawning awareness of who she \"was,\" and what she really is, is the only mildly interesting angle to be found in this pointless, aimless plot.And the whole question of Solaris itself is given incredibly short shrift. It's obviously a very odd \"rogue\" celestial body that's wandered into our solar system, and long enough ago for humans to have placed an elaborate observation structure in orbit, but we aren't told anything about it.  It's just...there.I'm not a big fan of George Clooney, but this disappointing film is hardly his fault - DeNiro or Edward Norton would have had trouble making the character interesting/believable.No, the blame goes to writer/director Steven Soderbergh.

Because on the love story side and the FX side we were on the good way, just the choosal of taking out the plot about the ocean the way we see it in the book or The '72 movie could have worked.

This production is a total waste of time, money and effort and will make it very hard for someone to create a decent remake.What Soderbergh did indeed qualifies as an insult that ended up being total flop both artistically and financially. He's simply not the caliber to even be able to tackle \"Solaris\" on any level. That requires an author capable of understanding philosophical aspects and doing conceptual and visually charged work.Clooney mooning the camera while completely incapable of bringing any depth to his character is plain laughable and just that would be more than enough to make Lem puke. Add wooden Natasha McElhone, despite having a lot of material and the picture is almost complete. Compare how Natalya Bondarchuk did much more with much less in the original but with Tarkovsky behind the camera.One can easily say that the whole cast was completely wrong. Actors for \"Solaris\" need the presence to make their characters deep and alive from the first scene - the job for Nicholsons and Hoffmans, not Clooneys.The whole production looks like a TV spot and ad combo. Even the set design is a total miss - looks more like a hipster office building rather than claustrophobic, ill maintained, almost abandoned lab at the end of the world.Soderbergh messed up even further by introducing 2nd female character and fabricating \"murder twist\" around \"Snow\" which reduced the whole thing to a cheap thriller with ridiculous plot hole. Chances are that Soderbergh just doesn't have the brains to comprehend Lem so he thought that he could plug in any nonsense and that it won't be noticed. He didn't even understand what's massive X-ray exposure/radiation for a living system (actual science and the dark corner of satellite geophysics that Lem stretched just a bit).",

The source novel on which both productions are based is really too complex to be visualized fully--which is not about romantic love per se, but about large philosophical questions and the limits of empiricism and epistemology--so I expect the author Stanislaw Lem to dislike the American adaptation of his book as he did the Russian version. (Incidentally it is said about the polymath Lem that, if it wasn't known he writes science fiction, he would have been a Nobel prize-winner.) But like the book Soderbergh strives to eliminate the trashy elements that are so much a part of the fantastic genre--robots, space battles, aliens, ray guns, etc, all the stuff you'd expect in a Star Trek or Star Wars movie. The result is an intelligent, mature, thoughtful, and in my opinion very watchable contribution, though perhaps not as ground-breaking as some have claimed it to be.",

I only finished this about an hour ago, and I guarantee I'll have even more questions tomorrow than I have running through my head a mile a minute currently.Before anything, I have to mention that this movie is best seen with another person.  Be it a romantic interest or what have you, find someone to see this movie with who enjoys discussion of consciousness and the soul.  You'll enjoy it much more afterwards having talked to someone, and will probably sleep better ;)I'm not going to go into details about why I liked the acting, but I've always liked George Clooney from the roles he played such as Daniel Ocean or Doug on ER and I enjoy Natascha McElhone for her roles in movies such as Truman Show and Ronin.  Suffice to say they were both excellent in their parts, and generated a genuine on-screen romance as the slightly cynical, but emotionally restrained couple that couldn't bear to tell the other how much they really needed each other.  It was not only interesting to watch, but plausible and at times heart-wrenching.What amazed me about the movie were the things you just couldn't predict.  I can honestly say that the script was not the kind you'd be able to expect certain dialog from.  Clooney's character, while grieving and emotionally distressed, asks the truly scientific questions a philosopher would pose in spite of his inability to cope with the reappearance of his deceased wife. McElhone's character acquiring her own consciousness also throws you off the course you thought you were taking with the movie.  The execution of the film is magnificent, and I honestly never had any idea what to expect at any time during the film.The movie will not register with MANY MANY people and while this bothers me greatly (at our lack of understanding on the societal scale) it's a disappointment that the philosophical nature of love might go unregarded. The ambience of this movie was a mix of psychological horror and a the kind of deep, solidly spiritual love that can't be measured.  Only a handful of people were in the theatre with me at the time and from what they were saying to me it seemed that the majority of them were expecting something that they didn't see.BOTTOM LINE - If you're looking for a date flick, this may not be it.  Then again if you're a die-hard science fiction fan you may not enjoy this either.  If you're in a committed relationship revolved around a true bond to your partner and you like to talk about things BESIDES other people and events then this movie just might strike a chord with you.  I'll be falling asleep with my soulmate tonight, looking into her eyes and wondering just why she loves me like she does because of this movie.    9.5 / 10",

I read the novel after I saw the movie, and Soderbergh made a film that is different from the novel, not unexpected but perhaps unhappily for Lem's fans. George Clooney plays Dr. Kelvin, a psychologist or psychiatrist, who is called out to deep space to find out what's gone horribly wrong on a space station. People are killing themselves on the station, and the survivors are clearly insane. Kelvin soon finds out why.The movie unfolds like a flower blooming, but we're still left confused, I'm sorry to say. Lem's point in his novel (at least as I understand it) is that aliens and humans will have absolutely no way to establish communications. Zero chance. None. Totally alien creatures have no basis for understanding, no way to grasp what is intended, and no way to communicate effectively. Soderbergh takes a part of the novel and makes his Solaris a love story of longing and loss. Although Soderbergh does this quite well, he still has hung his story on the frame of Lem's novel, and there's no fit. The alien novel can't support the human film.As a love story, Soderbergh's Solaris is compelling and heartbreaking as the story of Kelvin and his dead wife Rheya (played by Natascha McElhone) unfolds in bits and pieces of flashback and dreams finally becoming fully developed, and we learn what Kelvin's problem is. Clooney is masterful with his tired, sleep-deprived face showing all Kelvin's internal confusion, loss, and anguish.But the ship is staffed by the remaining crew of lunatics. Jeremy Davies is particularly good as the totally insane Snow, and Viola Davis does a competent job as Gordon, the only one with a scrap of sanity left. Whatever damage has been wrought by the alien presence is left unexplored and unexplained, and the ending is terribly unsatisfying, despite the tinkling music by Cliff Martinez, which I enjoyed.Overall, I like the movie, but it can't quite carry the weight of Stanislaw Lem's complex novel.",

It's beautifully photographed, by the way, and I loved the understated special effects (unlike almost any \"space\" story). Here's a comparison: if you like Pulp Fiction, you'll probably like this film. If P.F. makes you ask \"What day is it now?\", you probably won't like Solaris.",

            "content": "After watching this film I felt as if I had taken a strange trip nowhere.  I was confronted with so many flashbacks and flashforwards and flashgordons, that I was in limbo for a while, much like the characters in the film. Perhaps the director wanted to achieve this effect, I don't know.  I can tell you it seemed to place such emphasis on George Clooney and his character that it felt similar to a space version of Cast Away with Tom Hanks, as it specifically hyper-developed one character above all others for much of the film.  George is a good actor, that's not my complaint.  I just felt that I was looking too long at something other than what the movie should be about.  This film is about the discovery of a spacial abnormality, a nebula-like cloud known as Solaris.  But rather than placing the film's emphasis on Solaris, we are quizzically confronted with the torments of the main character's (George Clooney) life.  But here is the rub.  The director, in wanting you to understand Solaris, makes you go through all the extensive character conflict and development.  Trust me, while you can watch this in a oxygen-rich environment, you'll feel as if you're stuck in some empty pod on the planet \"What the Hell\".  This sort of reminds me when all the big underwater thriller flicks were coming out that displayed both the good and bad to the unknown (Deep Star Six vs. The Abyss).  This film was an Abyss that just went too far off into the blue yonder.  And the ending felt as if it were quietly attempting to creak into the depths of 2001: A Space Odyssey.  But there aren't any stimulating afterthoughts in this one though.",

            "content": "Before writing word one on my comment on Solaris its filmmakers, people who have accomplished much success and mucho dinero making highly commercial and successful, standard Hollywood entertainment deserve a most hearty salute. Here, they calculated an entry into the world of limited audiences as most people alive have no interest in or grasp of existence.   They took it further by also venturing into the fear-ridden world of the Religionist with a dialogue on Creation. Most Religionists mistake the metaphorical, instructive, inspirational and motivational tales of their various Scriptures with actual world history. Thus, they are fearful and defensive to the point of wrath.  In pursuing this cult of the closed mind they are not open to any question of their various Scriptures.  It wasn't too long ago that a death sentence (Ayatollah Khomeini's declaration of a \"fatwah\" against Salman Rushdie in 1989 after his 1988 publication of Satanic Verses by Viking, a New York publisher) was imposed on the extraordinary author.  At this writing the Middle East is aflame in a conflict based on this fear.  Thus Solaris filmmakers, you have exhibited valiancy and generosity of spirit, mind, and purse.  For that, you are to be congratulated.Now for the product: Although the \"I Am\" concept of mind construct of our reality is as old as the earliest of Hindu philosophies, demonstrated even in the early Upanishads of 5000 years ago and carried on through the latter ones called the Vedas, only in the 20th Century did two human events finally occur to help us grasp their essential truth. The first was Albert Einstein, who in 1905 began his first publications on Relativity and more than half a century later, in 1966 after three years of experimentation and documentation with the publication of her first book (with husband Rob Butts) Jane Roberts, a woman in Elmira, New York. Through mental focus Jane locked onto a formless body of knowledge named Seth.  This body, published with embellishments as The Coming of Seth, a decade later, reverberated throughout the world and introduced in great detail, the nature of ultimate reality.\n\tSolaris is a filmic depiction of this concept and at first glance it appears to be incomplete and fragmented.  Upon close scrutiny we see that it is a complete and satisfying presentation of the question of existence. After all, it is really the question itself, the enigma that has no finite, humanly understood answer, which causes life itself.",

I waited until the film was shown on TV rather than go to the cinema to see it.

            "content": "Steve Martin clearly said it right in the Academy Awards, two years ago: \"The trailers give away to much of the movie\". Indeed. Solaris was wrapped up in big expectation: the reported George Clooney's nudity; Steven Soderberg writing and the return of James Cameron. The story goes that a mission to the planet Solaris, in an unknown future is on the verge of jeopardy. Security teams have been sent and have not returned, and the crew has lost contact, aledgedly insane. Dr. Chris Kelvin is sent in as a specialized psychiatrist, whose head is shaken up by the recent death of his wife. When he arrives he has to deal with the strangeness of the remaining crew as well as the visits of her dead wife that abound in his thought. As producers said, the movie is all about second chances, as well as choices, being the whole thing just a metaphor. However, Soderberg messes up in the writing passing everything on the directing. The trailer suggested something different. The trailer came out as one of the best - as long with The Two Towers and X2 - of the year. Cliff Martinez's score although present wasn't there. It was needed something powerful and striking, whereas what we get is almost none. George Clooney and Natasha McHelone's performances alternate between sublime and dull, coming as a result dull, the supporting Jeremy Davies does it all on what acting is concerned. The planet Solaris, the mysterious identity that runs the whole movie only gets atractivly creepy in the end. What Solaris needed was Science Fiction atmosphere; it should make us believe that we were really in space, something that the 2000's worldwide hated (guilty pleasure to me) Supernova, had to have and to hold.4 out of 10.",

            "content": "I have both this and Tarkovsky's version of Stanislaw Lem's novel. I found both of them to be somewhat of a trial, although for slightly different reasons. Both are slow, and unless you are easily confused and generally clueless, they don't actually have much of a mystery to them because the secret of the \"mystery\" is kind of obvious very early on. Where this one fails compared to the 1972 version is that the science fiction is merely a shallow vehicle for a rather stodgy and slow treatment of a doomed romance. There's no actual science in the story at all. It's full of rather obvious logical flaws which distract from the story. There's also little to no science fiction in this version, since it revolves almost entirely about a lonely man's inability to deal with the loss of the difficult and rather fay woman he loved; the science fiction, such as it is, merely provides a pretty backdrop and an excuse for a series of dull flashbacks to the highlights of their relationship. Where the modern remake scores over Tarkovsky's film is that it's about an hour shorter, which means you can get it over and done with that much quicker. On the balance I found the modern take to be more accessible, the only problem being the lack of interest in what you are able to access.To sum up: if you're a science fiction fan rather than a fan of romantic drama, don't bother. If you're a fan of slow, dense, intense romantic dramas with troubled characters who sit staring into space for unreasonable amounts of time, and with stories which have pretensions of being intellectual, then you will probably enjoy this.The seven points I'm giving it are for a good cast who put in decent performances despite the stodgy material, and for fairly decent production values. I feel like I'm being overly generous and it actually doesn't deserve more than 6 points, but what the hell. At least they tried hard.",

Saw it sooner, though, mainly to discover whether Soderbergh, working apparently from the book, would somehow hit on the shot from Solyaris that's stayed most assuredly with me. It may be the very last shot in Tarkovsky's film. His camera draws back from the memory event on the planet's surface, until the phenomenon looks like a scab and the planet like flesh. It may look a bit, as well, like a sunspot or Jupiter's blemish, but the scab metaphor yields more: a wounded orb, spontaneously healing itself.Soderbergh's planet's blue, constantly spewing and drawing back to itself gaseous tendrils. Key to embracing Solaris is to forget, as much as possible, Solyaris. Clooney's a huge romantic star, with huge star baggage. Cary Grant stricken humorless in a spacesuit. Imagine the only sort of film that could have put Grant in a spacesuit. I think maybe it's the romantic comedy lurking beneath that makes Clooney's George Kelvin's tragic resignation as affecting as it is. Beneath the tragedy in Natascha McElhone's face is a big-mouthed, pouting clown.The thing about Rheya (McElhone) is her situation is actually that of each of us, not excluding George Kelvin. Each of us, in one sense or another, is imagined into being by our parents. Even the worst cases imaginable, battlefield rapists and worse, if there is worse, I'm sure somehow image offspring, imagine life created. But parents raising children, foster parents raising others' children, continue imagining, imaging, lives, just as Kelvin continues imaging Rhea and even Rheya 2 after that early plot turn. Each of us imagines and is imagined by our lovers. Each of us arrives in a world that existed with myriad complications before us, and leaves, too soon, long before it will end.Yet what Kelvin engages in, as his crashingly sane colleague Gordon, played by Viola Davis, implies, is a sort of necrophilia, a sort of onanism. See the really dark coda to A.I. in which David resurrects a sentient yet rigidly terminal manifestation of his \"mother\" (mistaken by many critics for Spielbergian pap).Maybe this is a film for those who experience or temperament has never led to Lem or Tarkovsky, but it's not a bad way to go.",

However, Soderbergh's signature intimacy takes over in the film; while the confusing nonlinear sequence towards the end allows the audience many different interpretations, the sensuous last scene may leave the viewers a feeling that the film's argument is romance, rather than the existential examination of Lem and Tarkovsky.Aside from Lem/ Tarkovsky, as one independent piece, the film showcases the excellence of Soderbergh's one and only intimate atmosphere, distilled by great acting from the great casts (especially George Clooney and Jeremy Davies), simple and subtle art directions for the space station and the space landscape, and quiet and pop computer compositions that are reminiscent of Terry Riley and Carl Stone.",

George Clooney is expressionless through most of it, except for a wide eyed 'deer-in-headlights' look, Natascha McElhone (Recently of the terrible Feardotcom) is about as animated as a pencil, and they way they have her staring into the camera sometimes is downright creepy, and some of the plot holes you could drive a truck through.

After Cloony steps onboard the station, Zero mention of them. You would think that Gordon or Snow (the stations final survivors) would have said something about them, or if they turned up someplace, maybe a message would have been waiting for Clooney when he came out of hypersleep.

We need you to go to the space station at some planet called Solaris, because we lost contact with it and the military team we send, but we know that you have special skills to deal with the situation.

Solaris does something to the people, for good or bad. It puts our humanity in the front, it is not something specific to absolve people of their sins..

The first question with remakes I suppose should be why? I can see the reason for this film being to bring a really good sci-fi story to the younger generation that probably won't be seeing the 165min Russian original. I heard some comments that this movie was too slow or too boring. Well, in that case, I'm sure they wouldn't have had the patience for the original. I've also heard some sci-fi fans who really appreciate Soderbergh's version...in those cases, I'd consider the idea of doing the remake a success. I'm sure some of them would definitely appreciate the original, but I'm sure a certain percentage wouldn't be willing to sit through the same slow-paced story when the running time is nearly twice as long in the original. Soderbergh did a fine job with this movie and did fairly well at capturing the feeling of the original in a quicker time. If that was his vision, then I think he succeeded. He didn't really add anything new to this story. This movies is pretty much an exact, but compacted, copy of the original Tarkovsky film. The actors were adequate, but I didn't get the emotion, albeit subtle, that I got from the Russian original. I personally feel the gratuitous shots of Clooney's butt were unnecessary. In my opinion, Clooney's lead character may have been better with a lesser known actor. He plays the role fairly well and it's one of his more subtle performances to date, but you can't help but see certain Clooneyisms come out from time to time, especially when he gets upset. Though I feel Soderbergh did well to cast lesser knowns in the supporting roles. All in all, it's a decent remake bringing a solid sci-fi story to modern day fans of the genre, but I'd recommend the original to those who can make it through the epic length Russian version of this story.\n**1/2 (Out of 4)",

            "content": "SPOILERS!! There was a guy.  A doctor-guy whose wife was dead.  He lived in the future. He was sent back to a planet called Solaris.  He'd been there before, I think.  Strange things were happening there.  The guys who asked him to go back were out-of-focus, enigmatic, those kind of guys.  In orbit around Solaris he found a woman locked in her room, a guy who was seriously wacky, and a kid.  Some or all of these people should not have been there.  It didn't take long for doctor-guy to start going as crazy as everyone else. Or did it? Or was he?  Crazy, I mean.  See, the doctor-guy's wife, dead as a door-nail, came back.  To the space-ship. The one in orbit around Solaris. Our hero sent her away again, in a scene of painful simplicity: he got her into the module, locked her in, and she was gone, sliding out of the frame, a look of awful realisation on her face, staring at her husband, who had turned his back on her.  But she came back again.  See, the planet was doing this - creating apparently real manifestations of dead people.  Why?  To paraphrase Kinsgley Amis, the only sensible answer to this question is, \"Yes, that's right, why?\"  The people on the spaceship (a downright strange brew of real and created people) sat down to see if they could sort things out.  The scene that followed was weird and slightly laughable, one of two in which the film's grip began to falter (we'll get to the other one in a moment).  They couldn't sort it out.  But they could destroy the creations of Solaris using some contraption.  This had been proved to work on a previous visitor.  Our hero's \"wife\", fully aware that she was a fake, was quite keen on the idea.  In fact, she begged for it to happen.  It did happen. Then it turned out that one of the people we thought was real was fake too.  Our hero was pretty well gone by this point, as were most of the audience - a Hollywood movie set in the future and there's no lasers or chases or fights or gadgets?  How very strange. Our hero first met the woman who was to become his wife at a party.  They exchanged glances, they flirted (\"Don't blow it\") they quoted poetry.  On paper it all sounds pretty awful.  On film, as realised by that master of popular cinema, Mister S. Soderbergh, it is magnificent.  The camerawork, the lighting, the editing, the sound, the performances, all combine in the earth-bound flashback scenes to paint a languid, seductive picture of two people falling in love.  The only things I can compare these scenes to are, perhaps not that surprisingly, the two earlier Clooney/Soderbergh classics, \"Out of Sight\" and \"Ocean's Eleven\".  All three films contain sterling work by Clooney, oozing charm and creating a fizzing chemistry with his leading ladies. Meanwhile, back in the future, back in space, our hero has to make a decision.  Should he stay or should he go? Back in his apartment on earth he is chopping vegetables.  He cuts his finger.  The cut disappears.  His wife is there.  They embrace.  And this is the other moment in which the film falters for a second, almost loses it, and us.  The doctor-guy stands there, in a faintly ridiculous pose, his arms slightly outstretched, his face expressing a weary surprise.  It looks odd and, again, slightly laughable.  The film recovers, just about, and fades to black, and to the titles. The end.  Discuss.",

            "content": "One of the biggest problems with Solaris is that it is being marketed incorrectly.  Perhaps this is because it doesn't even know what it is. It is NOT a romance.  I'm not sure to call it a sci-fi or not.Perhaps my preconceptions have simply become too shaped by Hollywood. Initially the movie reminded me of Event Horizon (another mismarketed film) or Alien.  Consequently, throughout most of the movie, I kept on expecting tentacles or claws to pop out of Rheya's head.  Mind you, I'm not saying that I WANTED this to happen.Herein lies one big problem.  There are plenty of thriller moments throughout Solaris.  It builds expectations and tension in the audience and then proceeds to deliver NOTHING.  Imagine a typical slasher movie in which the protagonist slowly approaches the door at the end of the hall, reaches forward, opens the door...and then the scene fades and cuts to the same protagonist eating Cheerios in the kitchen a week later. Solaris is NOT a slasher or thriller but many times it pretends to be.About 60 percent of this movie is people staring blankly into nothingness. Another 30 percent consists of the trippy swirls of Solaris.  This leaves about 15 minutes for something to actually happen.You'll hate this movie if you like closure and a plot that clicks.  I call this the \"Sixth Sense\" syndrome.  Ever since the S.S., audiences have become accustomed to tolerating long-winded movies that seem to wander aimlessly with the promise that the ending will deliver a magical twist that pulls everything together perfectly.  This is definitely NOT the case with Solaris.  I understand that uncertainty is one of the primary points of this movie, but I think it was a poor choice to use the movie itself as a means to demonstrate this.Even as a pure sci-fi movie, Solaris is nothing special.  There isn't a single idea or concept that hasn't already been explored more eloquently by countless other sci-fi movies.  And there's no need to present these ideas in such an unconsumable-to-the-masses form as Solaris.  A typical Star Trek episode has better sci-fi than this; plus you save 45 minutes.Throw in awful film editing and immensely annoying characters who always mumble their lines, and you end up with a frustrating movie that's generally pretentious and not very interesting.I would recommend this movie only if:A) You love movies that are so abstract and vague that you basically need to write half the movie in your head to fill in all the blanks.  Perhaps this may be considered \"clever\" movie-making for the thinking viewer, but I think it just boils down to bad storytelling.B) You love George Clooney, and you love his butt.  (No and No, for me)All in all, I give Solaris an imdb 4/10.  Oh and another thing. (SPOILER??):  This movie ends by flashing its title, SOLARIS, in big, bold letters across the screen.  I hate it when movies do this.  As if we might have forgotten which movie we were watching?",

So I was expecting something outstanding.He sadly missed in this movie every single opportunity to give the potentially moving story a chance to touch the viewer. To be moved by this, one has to be so sensitive that he/she cries when viewing \"Dallas\".Yeah, the spaceships look good. Yeah, the cinematoraphy is neat. Yeah, the woman has touching eyes (the \"Emily Watson effect\"). Yeah, Clooney has a nice butt. So what? This is just another of this modern and uninteresting movies which, instead of using cinematic narratives, just **illustrates**, \"nicely\" and \"cleverly\", a story like if we already knew it before... and expects from the viewer to be immersed in the story just because it's a good story. Bad news, Steven, a director's work is not only showing what he can do, using creative editing and cool cinematography... He actually has a role to play in the way the viewer relates to the story and the characters! Have you forgotten this since \"Sex, lies and videos\"?We know nothing about the characters, and we are asked just to deal with what happens, and the way they behave. I don't mind to feel far from the characters if a philosophical purpose is cleverly exposed or evocated, or if the audiovisual narratives incline to meditation, like in 2001. Here it's almost impossible, as the whole movie is drawned deep into a stubborn musical score that makes each scene \"feel\" exactly like the one before. This music seems to tell you: \"nothing is happening, don't worry, you shall not be moved, or scared, or even interested, just be patient and the film will eventually come to an end\"... Zzzzzzz** - the only meditation allowed is to think of the shopping list... result: people who already don't like that much slow-paced movies will HATE them after seeing Solaris. Well done, indeed, Steve, well done!There is no real emotional drive in Solaris, though the director seems to think differently. Good for him. To feel concerned by a character's emotions, one must get close to him/her. The flashbacks in Solaris are an inadequate way to fill the gaps of the early narrative, and they give only flat explanations, not meaningful inner motives. A touching love story is not made out of mere facts, neither is a good SF story.The whole thing looks pretentious and utterly empty, far too clean, intellectual and desincarnate, and the many nods to 2001 only make me think that Kubrick seems to have really traumatized directors, even talented ones like De Palma or Soderbergh, who have both been completely unable to come up with a \"space opera\" of their own without basically mimicking Kubrick's work, and fall into every obvious trap that lead to make boring SF movies \"in the manner of 2001\".When will a talented, artistic director have the guts to make a really creative, independant and meaningful new movie about the meeting of man with a cosmic intelligence, without desperatly trying to compete with 2001? Is there such a lack of imagination and creativity in the movie industry?Solaris was, for me, as interesting as a mix bewteen the worse aspects of \"Star Trek\", \"Sixth sense\" and \"A.I.\". How does it sound? Not very good. \"I see dead people from outer space... Are they real?\"The good thing about this movie is that it made me want to look at Tarkowski's original movie, hoping that the potentially excellent story was not, like in Soderbergh's movie, buried under the will to show off...",

She protested that she was indeed real, and began to cry.  \"You won't make yourself any realer by crying,\" one Tweedle remarked.  \"If I weren't real,\" replied Alice, \"I wouldn't be able to cry.\"  From the other Tweedle came the above punch-line.  Not directly related to \"Solaris,\" of course, but that basically is the movie's theme: How can we be sure we're real?  And does it matter?And will anyone care?  Up until about the mid-Seventies there was a market of sorts for quiet, contemplative character-driven stories, often with some quirky humor and without the traditional \"happy ending.\" Some of these stories even took place in outer space, e.g. \"Silent Running.\"  Then \"Star Wars\" came along and blew all that out of the water.  This remake of \"Solaris\" harks back somewhat to those times.  Most viewers will probably be reminded of Kubrick's \"2001,\" which under it's then-state-of-the-art SFX and metaphysical baggage ultimately was a traditional tale of Battling a Menace. (Be honest, \"2001\" fans: once th e sinister supercomputer had been disabled,  did the rest of the movie make ANY sense except as a series of pretty cool visuals, especially if you were smoking something at the time?) With \"Solaris\" some viewers may keep expecting a Menace to turn up. Well, I feel it's my duty to warn those undecided on seeing it: if that's what you crave, seek elsewhere.  Mr. Soderbergh has other fish to fry.  This comes as close as has any outer-space movie I've seen to being a \"chick-flick.\" Well hell, look who's starring in it.As I'd expected, Mr. Clooney does a great job here.  In too many film roles he's fallen back on the Doug Ross (from \"ER\") charm and twinkling eyes and even the semi-hesitant line readings.  Mr. Soderbergh seems able to reach inside and extract a kind of unguarded element from him, an edginess that I spotted way the hell back when he played Rose-anne Barr's boss on her TV show.  Here as the disaffected psychiatrist paralyzed with guilt over his wife's suicide he lets us get a peek at the bleakness and fear behind his bland facade.  Follow his reactions as he explores the (possibly abandoned) space station, there's not a false note.  Later he shows us an intelligent character turning his back on his intelligence, rationally choosing the irrational.  He makes it all seem natural, even inevitable.  Ms McElhone (who showed great promise in \"Ronin\" and soldiered bravely in \"Feardotcom\") does what she can with basically two roles to play, one as a memory and one as the manifestation of a memory.  She has the most enormous eyes I've seen in a while and certainly made me wish she'd had more screen time as a \"real person\" in \"real time.\"  The other cast members have very little to do but do it well, although the guy playing Snow started so many sentences with \"Yeah...\"  he reminded me of the unctuous suspenders-wearing boss in \"Office Space.\"I was really rooting for myself to get emotionally involved with the story here, but I guess I should have remembered that Soderbergh (like Godard) seems to go out of his way NOT to let his audiences get hooked.  He holds us at arms' length.  He spends just enough money to convince us this really is a space station (the original fell woefully short in that regard) even showing it spinning to explain that it generates it's own gravity, so the characters aren't floating inside.  The planet itself is gorgeous, pink and blue and pulsating, almost like an enormous jellyfish.  He throws in hints of plot like splotches of dried blood everywhere.  But bottom line, so far as I could tell, he wants us to think about his ideas.  Does he succeed?\nSPOILERS ***  SPOILERS ****  SPOILERS ****   SPOILERS ***  SPOILERS ***The Russian original from 1972 basically drowned us in verbiage but to it's credit, made a much more compelling case for the copy wife's human-ness. Thus the shrink's dilemma seemed more wrenching: go back to his sterile \"real life\" on Earth or stay on the ship for a chance at happiness with at least a facsimile of his wife.  When the copy wife also killed herself and he did go back home, there was a real sense of loss, enhanced by the famous closing shot with the camera pulling back from the shrink's house until it was obscured in clouds, to emphasize the isolation of not just him but humanity.  Soderbergh keeps the remake a lot more streamlined.  To an extent that's a big improvement, but it also imposes a kind of by-the-numbers quality on the proceedings.  Almost immediately after the copy wife's appearance--or rather her second appearance, because Soderbergh retains the original's sequence of the shrink blasting her off into space, an example of being overly faithful in my view---she's proclaiming her need and desire to be killed; we're not given the chance to \"take her side,\" in fact the black female scientist (a Soderbergh touch) asks Clooney \"Whose side are you on?\" Well if all she is is some alien freakshow, why should we care that much? Remember way the hell back on the first \"Star Trek\" series when there was a horrible salt-sucking monster that also could look like somebody's wife? Why's it even an issue?  It makes the shrink look petulant or even foolish for arguing with the black chick.  Soderbergh also inserts a scene that may or may not be a dream, with Clooney talking to a suicide scientist who chides him as \"a puppet dreaming he's real,\" which merely reminded me of a much better existentialist sci-fi flick called \"Bladerunner,\" from which \"Solaris\" also borrows for it's futuristic crowd scenes.  Then at the end of \"Solaris\" Soderbergh's train of ideas really seems to get derailed.  The shrink is back on Earth---OR IS HE?----and just as the old guy in \"2001\" knocked over a wine glass, here Clooney cuts himself while chopping a cucumber (as he had done earlier) but notices this time there's no wound,which prompts him to remember that maybe he never got back home after all, next thing we know, voila, there's his wife--a ghost? a clone?  an alien? ---reassuring him that all is well, all is \"forgiven\"---so what the hell, was the planet Solaris supposed to be God or something?   So we get our \"happy ending\" after all.   What supposedly is it with Americans, if we don't get a happy ending we're going to burn down the cinema or something? I found this the biggest cinematic disappointment in endings since \"What Dreams May Come,\" which should have ended when Robin Williams went back inside the little hell-cottage and slammed the door shut.  So ultimately what's Mr. Soderbergh telling us?  \"Never mind your life, never mind trying to deal with stuff or behave in a way that would do somebody some good, don't even give blood or anything, just inhabit your own morose little universe and if you're lucky, maybe some day you'll get to inhabit some other little universe, only happy not morose.\"   But in fairness to Mr. Soderbergh, I'm exhibiting some personal bias here; whenever I hear about the desire for an \"afterlife\" of some kind, I'm reminded of the line \"There are people who crave eternity who don't know what to do with themselves on a Sunday afternoon....\"I didn't even recognize Elpidia Carillo in a brief dinner-party scene. Damn, she was such a fox back in \"Predator\" ....",

It follows the trip of a psychologist named Chris Kelvin to a space station in orbit around the planet Solaris. The visuals of the planet, station, and equipment is great. The atmosphere that the special effects create feels perfect for the movie, invoking a sense of mystery and uncertainty. When Kelvin arrives, he finds that there are only two surviving members and proceeds to investigate. Ironically, he turns out to be the one that is effected the most by the planet. In short, the film revolves around the subject of memory, dreams, and emotion.The music is excellent. The dialog could have been better, but the acting was solid. George Clooney does a respectable job as Kelvin, although not outstanding. Since there are only four main characters, there is a special focus on each member of the team. The majority is centered around Kelvin and the memory of his wife, which is an interesting relationship that covers a wide range of emotions. The plot gets a little jumbled (mostly due to the constant switch between present and memory) and has several unexplained parts. Even so, it is easy to get immersed into and gives a satisfying conclusion.Solaris is a must-see for sci-fi fans or broad thinkers. It is visually beautiful and has intriguing content.

And how anyone can say the music score in the Soderbergh version was better than the (albeit altered somewhat) Bach chorale prelude, in the Tarkovsky film, just baffles me. The haunting melancholy of the F minor piece perfectly matched the feeling of the story. People also complain about the extended car journey through the city. But that was making a point. When it cut, suddenly, to the scene of the beautiful, tranquil countryside , it was a tremendous contrast to the noisy, ugly, polluted cityscape. That, I feel, was the point the director was making, and with such force. To me, Soderbergh's version is a dumbed down, Hollywood love story, with a pretty boy lead, and little substance. If you can't handle the slow pacing of the original, then I guess the subject matter of Solaris is really not for you, anyway. In which case, why not stick to action blockbusters and the like ? I am not meaning to insult anyone, I'm just saying that weighty themes such as those dealt with in Solaris are unsuited to the Hollywood treatment and cannot be done justice by substituting gloss, glamour and special effects for great cinematography and direction. Reading this back to myself...I guess I sound like a bit of an elitist snob. Well...I'm sorry if it appears that way, but there is just something that separates great films, like Tarkovsky's Solaris, (think also: \"The Third Man\" and Pasolini's \"The Gospel According To St Matthew\") from the average, run of the mill stuff. And whatever that is, it makes them truly great, and puts them in a class of their own. Soderbergh's movie cannot hold a candle to the 1972 version.",

            "content": "This movie has an annoying, sluggish, artsy pace reminiscent of Kubrick's space turd called 2001: A Space Oddissey. Fortunately, it's slightly better. Instead of just raising questions what the hell the plot is all about, the movie is more about universal questions. The plot is more clear but there's still enough to make you guess. Is Solaris some sort of heaven were souls come back from? Is it a giant alien able to create hallucinations and read minds? What is death and what happens afterwards? Is there a god?The movie looks good and has overall fine acting. What I didn't like however was the offbeat, overly weird acting by the two male supporting actors. They were trying too hard to be different and were whispering the entire movie. It had this overly artsy feel to it like they desperately wanted to have as much weirdness in the film as possible. I would say it is better to have more identifiable characters in a film, otherwise you estrange your audience. I guess Soderbergh is to blaim, a director willing to try anything can be faulty. However, I did like the female doctor and Clooney and the other actress were fine (sorry, names....). I'm not sure about the clinical style the movie has because it makes you care less about the characters and identify less with them, while their emotions have an enormous influence on their actions and inactions in this story.So, there's plenty of flaws to this film. Still, I liked part of it. I love SciFi in general and this is true SciFi, I also liked the visuals, and the ideas behind the story. The movie is worth discussing afterwards, especially the end will have you wondering...what happened? I thought Clooney was not Clooney anymore but a \"clone\" created by Solaris. That would explain him feeling unfamiliar with earth when he came back. As for a more universal theme the film raises questions like is there an afterlife and what does it look like? Like one of the characters says there's no answers, only choices.In the making of, James Cameron stated you won't see a movie like this in the 70s, 80s, 90s or in the near future. He looked kind of angry too, probably feeling people underrated this film. Tho I would agree Solaris has a unique quality I still think it was a bit of an arrogant statement of Cameron, as much as I admire his work. I think, if you look well enough, you'll find plenty of thoughtprovoking, intelligent, offbeat and non-action scifi out there, like Silent Running, Logan's Run (70s), Brazil (80s) and Dark City (90s). And the original Solaris was a 70s film as well, I haven't seen it so I can't tell if it's that different.Overall, still an interesting one to watch. 7 out of 10.",

            "content": "There are many ways it is thought that the human kind exhibits its proclivities and the advent of the motion picture has become a sort of door step to make believe and play acting.The obvious naive sensibility that can be entered into when faced with the prospect of having to put one over is not what I would consider a true artistic longing as perhaps in what might be called an entertainment medium.The motion picture is not a true art form and more threateningly has provided a heavy hand to a often treacherous political underpinning that is more dangerous than merely play acting.This picture is that kind of dirty politic and it provides a underpinning that will lead us to the world known as reality.Solaris is presented as one thing in this motion picture when in fact it is symbolic of another and that be reality.The quote unquote truth is that science fiction films tend to disguise certain human frailties a certain way so as to sell a science fiction film.The inability to place a definitive context as to its assumptions are mis-leading and unjustified.To put it bluntly this motion picture is a notorious fraud.A lying dog if ever there was one and what it represents is the realization that some guy over there wrote this book and it is based upon some book.The truth is that is the depth as to this disease upon the human race, it is not only a lie but the source is as well and it all came from reality to begin with.The motion picture suggests that there is something in this world called a dream,there isn't and even more so the belief in the occurrence of a dream is unsubstantiated as reality will make certain of that.Reality is not only a un-natural imposition but wishes you to be convinced otherwise.The idea of propaganda is even not such the heavy weight as reality is in fact a determined and prolific attack which has been sustained for some 75 or more years.That was when the big mouth got its way and it provided for the death of Democracy among other ideas that such an imposition actually represents.Reality can be suggested as influence, however influence though is not such a harmless creature now isn't it?The field effect is a widening gulch of just how pervasive this imposition is and this can only suggest that we are living in a world that is the construction of a fraud.Civilization or so it would seem has been influenced by that big mouth and lies like this film and so much else do not constitute any legitimate calling nor is there a politic that can be diagnosed outside of the illusion that we are free in any respect.The imposition and its character are the basis for all we believe in and there is another disgraceful result as to this worlds idea of getting its way and that is there is no value that provides for an answer outside of the lie that it is representative of.The further enhancing of realities position is that in its determination to get its way,the film and other concerns wish to allow for something attractive and as well provide for the illusion that a field is not harmful,even in its physical capabilities.You better think again,because the field of regard is a menace that if struck outright can knock a human to the ground,render one unconscious or make for a heart attack or death.Its proclivities are of such a propensity as to be foreign not as from where but as to why.The assumption as to a challenge is that deadly force is used when in fact this force is of another world and begs to dealt with as not only a foreign imposition but just as deadly as if one was struck by a projectile.This is in fact a very violent imposition determined to get its way. What is most uncomfortable is who are we?What is the source of this power over another and is it possible that we in fact do not dream but are in fact imposed upon by a real impostor.Though Solaris is in outer space,does reality possess the propensity to extend to 33,000 feet?Are we in fact imposed upon even at thirty thousand feet?Is the field of regard that hysterical a notion to have shown Adolph Hitler up?I believe things have improved thats why and its position has been more firmly entrenched.Thats something to consider,that the ambitious nature of this impostor is of such to have had greater ambitions than Third Reich.My what a deal.This film is not honest and perhaps as deflating as any that due to this imposition the human kind is not only less human but lacking in resolve.There is a very unworthy attribute that some even perhaps many of these films provide for and that is in fact that there is no belief in each other nor is there any quality to Love.There is nothing there to comment on except some slick advertising campaign.The human kind is a miserable failure and all the more ambitious are the proclivities of reality which place a predatory quality at the door step of civilization.Reality is the story not Solaris.The further issue is enhanced by the realization that reality isn't going anywhere anytime soon and though this is but the second time they have made a film entitled Solaris reality was the source back then as well.This is one mean idea and it is not worth extending this review.I don't approve of this kind of film nor is its politics worthy intellectually.",

            "content": "I've never really enjoyed any previous work from the director- _Erin Brockovich_ was fluff and _Traffic_ was just horrible- but _Solaris_ is really quite good.The film itself is beautiful.  I and others have accused Soderbergh of a bad Kubrick imitator in the past, but he seems to have fixed that here.  The style still very much Kubrick, but Soderbergh has taken it and made it his own.  The film reminds one of both _2001_ and _The Shining_, but comes from a different place emotionally and is thus very satisfying.  The lack of audio-visual sychronization, signifying the fragile nature of human memory, is very slick and works well here.The script can only be described as high-minded. Admittedly, the trailers are a bit deceiving, leading one to think that this will be a love story. It IS, but probably not in the way that you're thinking.  For most, this will be a big disappointment.  For those such as myself, it will be a welcome reprieve from current popular films that severely underestimate the audience.Clooney is as good as I have ever seen him- this is probably the most intellectual and challenging film he's ever done.  McElhone (most recently in the underrated _FearDotCom_) shows that when she's given good material, she can really shine.A minor complaint which is becoming more and more common for me these days: can we please have the credits at the front of the movie again?  It's not a time issue, obviously- in this film, near the beginning, I saw numerous opportunities where they could have at least done a \"Twentieth Century Fox presents\" schtick.  Just tell us the title of the freaking movie already. You can take five seconds and do that, can't you?Overall, this is a very, very good film.

This movie does have some quality acting in it too and I thought to myself before I saw this that the movie couldn't go wrong with someone like Soderbergh at the helm. I was wrong.First let me tell you what I like about this movie. I thought the soundtrack was exceptional. I also thought Clooney did a great job. That's it.You see, I don't require my movies to have all the answers but I do like my movies to make you at least curious as to what the answers are. This movie has no answers, ends unresolved, and honestly, I didn't give a crap what the answers were. To say this movie is slow would be the understatement of the year and I think the people on Imdb saying how extrordinary this movie is are simply trying to show how \"smart\" and \"sophisticated\" they are by going against the majority of movie goers. I usually think the public doesn't know anything about movies (Godzilla, Wild Wild West, etc.) but this time I am going to have to agree. I have never seen so many people leave a movie FIFTEEN minutes into it! I made myself sit through it hoping that something would happen but nothing ever did.So, in my humble opinion you might want to skip this flick.

He finds himself in a bind because he is confronted with a reality that doesn't fit the reality he has come from. Is he \"here\"? What is \"here\" from \"there\"? His objective reality is shattered by subjective reality, which is as much known as unknown. He is tortured by this psychological enigma.

            "review_title": "Breathtakingly beautiful!",
            "content": "Although this film took a while to sink in, I finally came to the conclusion that it is probably the best film I've seen in the last five years or so. It encompasses the melancholy, the beauty and the metaphysical intelligence I am obsessed with and it got me thinking about the themes of love and death more than any other film could ever manage. Although I think that Clooney was miscast on this film (he's a bit too bourgeois to play in a mind-disturbing film like this) I think he did a very good job. Natasha McElhone was beautiful to look at and I was surprised to see Ulrich Tukur in it (who is well known here in Germany but probably not famous enough to be cast for a Soderbergh film, or so I thought). Anyway, when I saw this movie in a French cinema, looking at the poster, I expected one of these typical sci-fi movies where people in space are confronted with some kind of monster and try to fight it. To my surprise, this was not the case. Chris Kelvin (George Clooney) works as a psychiatrist. He recently lost his wife (she committed suicide) and Soderbergh within the first scenes establishes the fact that Clooney is devastated and rather disillusioned. He is still working as a psychiatrist, but he looks as if he was just faking interest in his clients' problems. Then, one night, two members of a space agency called DBA knock at his door and show him some video footage of his friend and astronaut Gibarian (Ulrich Tukur), who is on the planet Solaris. Gibarian asks Kelvin for help, but he doesn't say what is happening because he is frightened and because the walls have ears (or so he claims). Kelvin, who has nothing too lose, since his wife is dead, agrees to fly to Solaris and identify the problem. When he reaches Solaris he finds Gibarian dead (suicide) and two members of the crew dazed and confused. One is acting all weird (Jeremy Davies) the other female member locked herself in and refuses to come out. When Kelvin asks the Davies character what is going on, the Davies character tells him that he'll find out soon. At night, Kelvin goes to sleep and dreams about his wife (who, as I already mentioned, committed suicide). When he wakes from his dream, he finds that his dream has become reality. His dead wife is lying next to him, in the flesh. And this is what Solaris is all about: It resuscitates the dead friends and relatives of the crew aboard the ship. Chris Kelvin tries to deal with it by sending his wife away. But the next night, he again dreams of his former wife, the same thing happens. Because of his dream his wife materializes again, and this time Kelvin decides to stay with her. Now on Solaris, he knows that he can keep his wife who he still loves dearly, but he also knows that she is just a copy, a counterfeit model of his real wife who is dead and buried. This plot is, I think, a stroke of genius (conceived by Stanislaw Lem and his novel Solaris). On a metaphysical level it tells us that we sometimes are so haunted by things that happened in the past, that these things become more than just memories: At times, they are so real, that they define us to such an extent that they become part of our reality. If you have lost somebody, because they died in a car accident or committed suicide, you have not entirely lost them, because at times, you will still catch yourself thinking about them. So whenever we meet somebody and take a liking to them, we will also never lose them, because they will always be there even when they are dead. So, Mr. Soderbergh, congratulations again and thanks for this excellent flick. It made me read the novel and I also watched the first version of this film by Andreij Trakovski. I liked the novel, I was bored by the Russian version of this movie, but I enjoyed this film and it had a great impact on me and my writing (Oh, I forgot to say, I am a writer).",

It can be used as a vehicle to the wonderful or the terrifying. It can take you to distant uncharted planets or a nightmarish future. On the surface `Solaris' appears to be about the former. Chris Kelvin is solicited by his friend to journey to the space station that is studying the titular planet. His visit will be the last attempt to solve the rather ambiguous problems plaguing the station. We soon discover that this film is much more than a space journey filled your typical sci-fi raz-taz. It's no less a journey to the very nature of how we as humans relate and perceive one another. When one considers the apparent hero of the films profession is that of a psychiatrist as apposed to say a cop or soldier. This alone should tell the audience that this film is certainly not run of the mill. `Solaris' is most certainly an exercise in minimalism. A style that perfectly suits the films subject matter. The audience is not spoon-fed a bunch of pretentious psychobabble. The story is told with raw images and raw emotions. It is both a departure from the majority of science fiction cinema and a return to what the genre is capable of.The films mages are eloquently photographed using a combination of static and handheld camera. A beautiful color palette is used to communicate to the audience where they are in the time line. Cool greys and blacks for the Solaris station. Warm earth tones for the terrestrial  flashbacks. The emotions are that of a man who has lost his wife to suicide. He is then confronted with her apparent resurrection. This being the afore mentioned problem that was troubling the resident scientists of the station. It seems that every crewmember has their own `visitor'. The origin and purpose of which is unknown. Chris has to deal with facing a woman who looks and (almost) acts exactly like his deceased wife. On the surface it would appear he is being dealt a second chance. But he and his facsimile wife soon discover that this chance is fleeting when her true nature comes to the surface. The performances are superb all around. Mr. Clooney as Chris is called upon to display a wide range of emotions. He dose so with a subtle elegance that matches the rest of the films mood. All of  the supporting roles are played nicely as well. Jeremy Davies disjointed and appropriately odd ball character plays as a good harbinger to things to come. Ultimately the overall experience of `Solaris' is a satisfying one. I havnt any real complaints about the film. It in every way represents what I love about not only a good sci-fi movie, but good movies in general. I feel the film demands a patient audience, but the reward is worth the wait.",

Unlike 2001, however, this movie hasn't been considered a marvel and advancement in sci fi picture making. Quite the opposite, people really hated this film and found it very derivative. While I can see why people would say that, it really isn't that bad. Disconnected from all they hype and reviews, this movie is boring yes, but mildly interesting. It is hysterical to me, that the documentary about the film on the DVD is more action packed than movie itself.   Still, if you can divorce yourself from any hopes of excitement, this movie will be fairly entertaining.",

That kind of surreal movies with flashbacks, dreams, flash-forwards really get me and I have to say I was not disappointed with this one.This movie is about a planet (Solaris) that providers its visitors with people they have lost and miss. These beings are \"created\" by the planet based only on the memories of its visitors-no more no less; and once evoked from the planet these creatures seem to carry on with their free will. George Clooney is quite convincing in his role as one of those visitors. \n\"Solaris\" elaborates over phenomenon such as the nature of life, the importance of memory, and most of all the power of guilt; or maybe: the power of regret.

Here's another film that makes that most unforgivable of errors in science fiction, as it made it all pretty damn boring. Jeremy Davies and Viola Davis are the only ones who don't seem to have phoned in their performances, though with this stodgy script, there isn't all that much difference in anyone's acting.Rent the original 1972 movie.

            "review_title": "a surprising gem from Soderbergh",
            "content": "I dreaded seeing this movie.  Even though I find Steven Soderbergh one of the most interesting contemporary Hollywood directors, I don't find him particularly gifted or with an affinity for psychologically probing movies, at least since his 1989 movie \"Sex, Lies and Videotape.\"  Indeed as he's settled into his career as a director Soderbergh has become primarily a competent stylist, and an uneven one at that.  His most celebrated movie, Traffic, is an almost shot-for-shot copy of a BBC television miniseries, and most of the changes Soderbergh introduces to Americanize the movie are not for the better.Thus the thought of this director taking the strange beauty of Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 Russian science fiction art film and building a George Clooney vehicle around it only brought forth a sense of foreboding, that these Americans were surely biting off more than they could chew and would embarrass themselves -- and Hollywood by extension -- with a ridiculous effort.I'm surprised to report that in visiting Solaris Soderbergh has made his best movie, and arguably the best English-language science fiction movie since 2001: A Space Odyssey.In fact the only negative comment that leaps to mind minutes after leaving the theater is that Soderbergh's Solaris is perhaps a little too similar to Kubrick's masterpiece, and thus lacks the sense of awe, surprise and discovery that we look for in science fiction.  (Since precious few science fiction movies of the last 15 years contain any of these elements one is forced to measure Solaris against a theoretical mean rather than its contemporary competition.)Like 2001, Solaris is really a meditation on the human condition, in particular a consideration of the limits of what can be defined as the individual, as human, as sentient.  It is a simple, minimalist movie that doesn't have any interest in space opera, and conceives of action not as a matter of resolving conflict, but only as a necessity of making inevitable choices.  It's \"Waiting for Godot\" where Estragon and Vladimir are forced to flee the stage or perish at the end of the second act, where there is no option, as in Beckett, to simply ride out the calendar.  \"There's no solution,\" says a character in Solaris, \"there's only choices.  And unless you realize that, you're going to die here.\"  In Soderbergh's Solaris, the demand for solutions is a flaw, an artifact of the vain human ego that wants credit for \"being smarter than them,\" as Viola Davis' character asserts early in the film.This is not a film that is going to please the average American moviegoer, both because of its slow (but certainly not dull) pace, its focus on the psychological, and its disinterest in the notions of heroism that drive the bland balance of our moviegoing fare.  The film is paced slow not because the director is trying to drive home a point.  It is paced such in order that the viewer has time to consider, speculate and imagine himself in the philosophical position of the characters on board the spacecraft.  Viewers who would rather not figure themselves into the equation are indeed going to have some extra time on their hands watching George Clooney toss and turn in his dreams at night.  Nevertheless this is simply his best performance on the big screen, the first one where he's able to use his limitations as an actor as part of his character rather than battle (however valiantly) against them.Solaris is not the most fun movie you are going to see this winter, but it might be the best.  It's certainly a welcome change of pace from the increasingly vulgar and stupid drivel that Hollywood tries to pass off as science fiction, and perhaps best of all it suggests that Steven Soderbergh may have a higher gear that he's ready to shift into as a director, able to produce films that stand tall in the broad context of film history, and not just against the diminished stature of his contemporary competitors.",

            "content": "Steven Soderbergh, it seems to me, can direct just about anything (book, play or just an interesting idea) and make the best of what it has to offer. Solaris has a lot to say and maybe a little too much for some us. It is never just entertainment, it has much more to offer. Sometime ago I read an article about dream states. The main idea of this article was that we are all of us living in a dream; and all living matter is in a dream state peculiar to it's own species and indeed peculiar to each individual within that species. Something of this idea is being worked out in Solaris. Death does not end the existence of an individual but simply transfers him or her to a different dream state. One of the questions which this raises (if you accept the validity of the 'dream' state idea) is which of these dream states may, with authority, consider itself to be the ascendant state; is any of these states entitled to consider itself the one which is the sole arbiter of truth regarding the nature of existence. Solaris, somewhere out there - where doesn't matter, is a planet which has the power to allow individuals in different states of 'being' to see and contact one another with all the attendant confusion that this obviously brings to all parties on both sides of the existence/dream barrier. This moves on to pose many more questions and dilemmas e.g. does time continue upon changing states? If it does is it synchronous with all other dream states? Etc. This film isn't really just a sci-fi flick or for that matter, a romance it's in a category that's other than that. Decide for yourself what and where it is. Soderberg floats my boat. Always has.

            "content": "There's an old maxim about music that goes: \"All music is sound, but not all sound is music.\" In a way, what this says is: one should remember the intent of something before judging its worth. In the case of cinema, it can be re-written as, \"All movies are films, but not all films are movies.\" By this, I point to the distinction of 'movie' as a piece of filmed entertainment and 'film' as a work intended more as a creative expression with less emphasis on entertainment value. So enters Solaris.Firstly, Solaris is not a re-make of the Tarkovsky film. It is merely another interpretation of the original novel. Comparing the two films is like comparing two brothers, not a father and a son. This may seem incidental but is important when justifying the originality of each film and the lineage. Soderbergh's Solaris is, to me at least, a pure meditation on loss. It is slow but only so slow as to let the viewer react to the events, place them in their own lives, tally their effects and then place themselves back into the film. It pulses slowly and quite intentionally. To call it boring is merely to admit a lack of connection with it.Solaris is a work so specifically personal that it either destroys you or bounces off like a ping-pong ball with little ado. This is probably why Solaris is consistently either the most profound film many have seen or the most boring film many have seen. Either reaction is justified because what you get out of the film really depends on what you bring into the film.If you've ever had anyone close to you die in a way that left a mass of unresolved issues, this film addresses what is likely your greatest fantasy: what if they could come back? If you have had a great love that simply ended and you were never sure why, the film presents an allegory for what it would be like to have that again. If you live in dreams of a former life and the memories of a greater happiness in your past, the film is a vicarious journey back. What differentiates this from other films in a similar vein is that it takes place in the present. There is no time traveling involved. Characters are not transported back to their childhood to witness exactly what their past was like as a complete and entire world. It operates in reverse by sending a manifestation of the past into the brutal light of the present. This is what makes Solaris' take on remorse and lament so profound.Solaris doesn't so much celebrate fantastical second chances in life as it does brutally beg the truth of the past from the cradle of the present. Many lament the past as a greater time because it is a closed case. Where the present breeds uncertainty for the future, the past is a set, stable environment. We can choose to remember only the best qualities of someone and this inevitably snowballs into a perfect version of that person living exclusively in our own private past. Solaris brings such a person back from the dead and forces its lead character to remember why they died in the first place (sorry for being vague, trying not to be a plot spoiler.) It is not a rose-colored reality but a brutal reminder.If you can't relate to anything like this, well, this film probably just isn't for you. If you can relate to it, Solaris could send you on a pretty intense roller-coaster of emotions.I also feel that Soderbergh's Solaris is a stylistic masterpiece. Beautiful, original camera-work, set design, etc. Cliff Martinez's soundtrack is even better than his work on the film Traffic. Aside from my own personal emotional reaction to the film, I also feel it is a solid, unique piece of film-making and worth seeing.",

That the imagined Snow could kill his twin brother, the real one, this shows that the imagined characters have full consciousness. They start from their dreamer's memory but then develop on their own. When Kelvin chooses to stay on board, we see this cross-edited with scenes of him back on Earth. It isn't until the end that we see that the Kelvin on Earth is imagined, and possibly imagined by the imagined Rheya. So who is real?

Lem had three living humans on the station above Solaris, Dr.Snow, Dr.Satorius and Kris Kelvin.I know the current rage is to have african americans portray anyone these PC directors think they ought - pretty soon we will have present day Hollywood portraying President Eisenhower by Ice T or Cube or Will Smith, but for the love of God, enough is enough. There was NO Dr.Gordon in the book, and I guess Soderbergh felt he might score some bonus minority points by having a Black Female added to the cast as the station chief and Physicist. I do not might in having black actors act in roles that were written for them, just as I would oppose Mel Gibson playing Dr.Martin Luther King. But in todays' America, to be even suspected of less then fanatical enthusiasm for multicultural Diversity and changing reality to fit the current state of Political Correctness, is a crime against nature. Secondly, although the director follows the book fairly loosely, he surgically removes any of the scientific speculation which was the entire point of the book. I know that most of Hollywood considers the average american to be an idiot, and to a large degree they are right, but if Soderbergh thought he might rope in current americana by denuding the picture of intelligence, boy was he in for a suprise. Most of the people left the cinema in an irritated daze, not understanding the movie even after it had been stripped of any intellectually challenging parts. Why even bother to state thatthe movie was made from a book when the only thing that the book and movie had in common was the Title and overall concept of a sentient ocean? Looking at this movie as an original work having nothing to do with Lem's book, it isn't that bad. Great soundtrack, great atmosphere and visuals, a fairly clever, if not mundane plot.

            "content": "This is very simply one of the most beautiful and visual movies I have ever seen. Which is the very reason why it may not be for everyone. The movie tells the story of a troubled psychiatrist Chris Kelvin who recieves a message from his good friend Dr. Gibarian, who is a researcher on the space station orbating a planet seemingly made out of energy called Solaris. Kelvin travels to the space station where he finds two of the crew members dead, including his friend, and the other two acting very strangely. He then begins to recieve visits from his deceased wife who killed herself because of something he had said to her some years before.Seemingly being a science fiction film the audience might be expecting something very different from what they get. It is not an action movie but a film noir in the strictest sense of the word. The story is told more with imagery than dialog and moves very slowly. Though in my opinion the pacing serves to enhance the movie even more. The slowness will however chase away more restless viewers. The movie is also very thematically based serving to deal with such things as second chances, desire, love, reality, and god. Solaris won't give you anything in terms of where you go with it. It won't show you point A and point B and draw a straight line between the two. Instead it will give you point A and point Z and tell you to draw your own path with all the other points along the way.Really there is nothing I can say that will give you a correct picture of the film. This is partly due to the fact that it is so imagery oriented, and partly due to the fact that everyone I have talked to who really likes this movie has come away with a different meaning in it. I think it is best to go into the movie without any preconcieved notions about what you are going to see because I don't think there has been any movie quite as skillfully crafted in some time now.Definately not for the mainstream. Definately kind of a niche film. Definately a very deep and thought provoking movie. Definately on my top ten list.

So fired up was she that she ranted and raved incessantly for about an hour after we came out of the cinema. So what is the film at the centre of this debate? Well, it's is Steven Soderburgh's latest collaboration with George Clooney: a slow, meditative piece of filmmaking based on the seventies Russian sf classic Solyaris.The story involves Chris Kelvin (Clooney), a grieving psychiatrist, being called on to visit a space station orbiting a strange pink and blue planet (that looks remarkably like a human brain), where strange things have been happening to those on board. The planet is causing memories of the crew to become real living things, hence the strange behaviour and refusal of the crew to leave.When Kelvin arrives he is forced to confront his own feelings about his wife's suicide when he is given another chance to be with her. The story here is really secondary to the existential questions the movie poses, and the atmosphere and emotion that it tries to portray. I feel that for the most part the movie succeeds. It is certainly a brave experiment for Soderburgh and Clooney (last seen together with Oceans Eleven), and unfortunately has not been a great commercial success in the States (partly due to bad marketing). I fear that it will suffer the same fate here in the UK, where we want our Hollywood product loud, fast and manipulative. I think it may do well in Europe though, as it is more akin to the French style of filmmaking, where more stress is on dialogue and philosophy than on all out action.",

Solaris isn't a bad film, just rather dull, with the two main characters incredibly wooden. George Clooney is unconvincing as the psychologist summoned to investigate the space station's mysteries, and Natascha McElhone looks beautiful, whether smiling, bewildered or distressed - but expresses only those three emotions and says little of consequence.  The visuals of space are as good as I have seen but by the (ambiguous) end of the film the impression is left that the director was more interested in the visuals than the plot, despite the legacy of Lem's novel and Tarkovsky's film - both superb. A big disappointment.",

I think the marketing was flawed (this is a horrible romance and not much of a sci-fi) but I don't know how this film ever could have been marketed successfully. I think the marketing was a desperate attempt to scam people into going to see this opening weekend. The studio had to know that there would be horrible word of mouth on this film, with the exception of a few high brow, intellectual, existential critics, for whom this film appears to have been made.",

            "content": "I can't think of another person who admires Andrei Tarkovsky more than I. For me, he was a seer, a poet, a true artist. When I think of truly gifted filmmakers, I only think of two: Tarkovsky and Bergman, and in my opinion, Tarkovsky has ... no ... equal. When I heard that they were making another film version of Solaris, I could not even articulate my disdain. How can they take a perfectly good film, albeit, with limited special effects, by the greatest filmmaker of all time, and turn it into a Hollywood remake. Imagine Ivan's Childhood remade by Steven Spielberg, or Stalker as conceived by David Fincher. In essence, I believe that good films should never be remade, only bad ones... I could only conceive of Solaris as directed by Soderbergh, if he actually had the decency to make his own film, rather than remake the Tarkovsky version. I became more receptive before the release of Solaris when I understood that Soderbergh came across the story only through the Tarkovsky version, but by utilizing the plot structure through the original book by Stanislaw Lem. Why should I have disdain, I thought, it wasn't Tarkovsky's idea in the first place. Today, Soderbergh's film was released in my area, and I approached it without any preconceived emotions. This is what I thought: What results from Steven Soderbergh's Solaris is not necessarily a story, but really, a thought-provoking character that analyzes our drive for what's missing from our lives, no matter how closely it can be replicated. Is space travel a way of exploring worlds, or is it a way for us to \"create mirrors\" as one scientist states in the movie. Will we find anything that fills our need, or tells us more about ourselves? Solaris analyzes these questions. The thing that I admire about this version of Solaris is that it presents itself without fanfare, or action sequences, or unnecessary special effects. It may be classified as a science fiction film, but it's far from any Hollywood science fiction film you could conceive of. It's a very minimalist film, as demonstrated by the sequences where scientist Chris Kelvin (George Clooney) roams the corridors of the spaceship that he journeys to in the film. The sea of the planet that the ship orbits around takes memories and creates replicas of lost wives, brothers, friends, etc... Why it does this is never really explained. Sometimes the experience gives us more than any need from us to explain it. When a group of astronauts journeys to Mars in Ray Bradbury's The Martian Chronicles, only to discover their lost relatives, they can only conceive that, without skepticism, that they've been sent to heaven. It's hard to let go of the past once it's been returned to us, since everyone has something, or someone, that's so precious to us, but has been lost. So, for an initial reaction, I give my highest praise to Soderbergh and Cameron for making a film that flies in the face of the Hollywood excess I thought it would become. I give praise to this film, not from the standpoint of a Tarkovsky fan, but as a seeker.",

The story is nearly the same - an astronaut is asked to find out what has happened on a space station that orbits the planet Solaris. As soon as he arrives on the station, he is confronted with unbelievable events that make him question reality. While Andrej Tarkowsky's version was a pure art film, with long shot sequences and a meditative touch, Sonderbergh speeds up the storytelling a lot. He focuses on the issue of a lost love, and gives the story a different outcome concerning that point. Nevertheless, he still uses some of Tarkowsky's filming techniques, like extended tracking shots and the direct glance of actors into the camera. If you like to see a film that puts up more questions than it answers, then see Solaris by Sonderbergh. If you approach it with an open mind, you'll enjoy it.

            "content": "The movie plot The planet Solaris with its only inhabitant a sentient, vast and powerful living ocean of pure energy is watching the space station hovering in the sky. The ocean of Solaris is penetrating the minds of the crew and knows how they are, knows all their thoughts, desires and emotions. The man-made space station is an attempt to grasp the purpose of the mystical constantly moving ocean of energy enclosing the planet. Kelvin (George Clooney) is the psychologist that is sent from Earth to find out what happened to the people on the space station and a previous mission sent to rescue the crew.What he finds is but a remnant of the original crew. There seem to be only three people left. Three individuals all acting strangely, suspiciously and almost animal-like. As he get no clear answers about anything Kelvin has to go through whatever is going on and experience the truth for himself . As soon as he goes to sleep things starts to get eerie and he is during the night visited by his long dead wife. At least that is what he wants to think it is. What is the movie really about? I believe this movie is about what reality humanity is facing as we move ahead on our path of evolution. The original book written in 1961 by the Russian author Stanislaw Lem is widely misunderstood by many readers and also today by movies critics amongst others. Many critics though sense the depths but seem not to be able to place the novel or movie and its message in the proper context.\"Solaris leaves room for a few parallel and even contradictory interpretations; one can see it as a Swift-satire, a tragic romance, an existentialist parabola in Kafka-style, a meta-fictional parody of hermeneutics, an ironic tale of knights reminding of Cervantes or a Kantian meditation about the nature of the human mind.\" / Minotauro, publisher.My interpretation is that the ocean planet Solaris represents the human sub consciousness that responds to our thoughts and manifests our dreams. The space station is an analogy of the second form of existence of human kind, the non-physical worlds in our dreams and beyond the physical body.Solaris is the \"factory\" of our minds. It has its owns intelligence but no will, as pointed out by a crew member visiting Kelvin in a \"dream\". Solaris scan and reflects our minds and serves us accordingly. What dreams and desires may come are materialized. Solaris is thought-responsive and serve the people. The problem is that the humans on the space station are not ready for that since they have no control, no inner natural discipline of their minds. They are not pure enough, so to speak, and they easily attach to thought forms. What is on the inside becomes the outside as soon as they go to sleep, as soon as they become unconscious.From one aspect I believe the novel is a warning to human kind not to go too far in our technological and mental development lacking the energy of the heart. Because technology is 100% mental, is it not? We may very well stand on the brink of our own self-destruction because we have turned away from our soul and our inner beings far too long. Instead we cling to the outer material world, technology and soon outer space in a never ending spiral of desire to conquer new unknown areas of existence without first knowing ourselves. Sooner or later we may stand in front of the limits set up by our own mind filled with illusions and misconceptions about whom we are and what human life is all about.So are you ready to walk into a new reality, a brand new world where you can manifest your wishes simply by using the thought? Are your innermost parts of that which is you, all your thoughts, emotions, memories, aversions, aggressions, regrets and desires ready to be manifested and become you as your inside becomes outside.",

            "content": "I guess the rule these days are, if you're going to remake a film, make sure it's clever and it looks good. It's hard to argue with this version of Solaris on either grounds.The plot is not a direct copy of the original, which may or may not be more or less accurate as I haven't yet read the book, suggesting that Soderbergh may have interpreted the story in his own way. He proves that he's clever and can write a good story, though this version seems to provide the reader with more \"what if?\" details whereas the original seems to allow the viewer to ask these questions on his or her own.Maybe we are getting dumber these days ... remakes don't seem as smart as their originals.Soderbergh (as Peter Andrews) also shoots one heck of a film. In fact, I didn't know that Andrews and Soderbergh were one in the same until I saw the credits for Solaris and thought I'd seen his shooting style before. Sure enough, he also shot Ocean's Twelve, which in my opinion might be one of the more beautifully shot American films in recent days. Too bad the movie was typical Hollywood fare. It was clever and looked good. Of course I liked the original Ocean's Eleven better as well.So, while I don't think I'll be watching this update over and over again looking for new meaning as I have the original, this film made an excellent Saturday-afternoon-on-the-couch-view-once-veg-out flick, and it's finally inspired me to read the book.The original?

            "content": "The first time I saw this movie, I hated it. I initially gave it a 4/10 in here on IMDb. The fact that I had read Stanislaw Lem's novel prior to viewing Steven's cinematographic version led me to be quite \"enraged\" at the various modifications made in the overall story. I must say that I was expecting a \"typical\" sci-fi movie and that I wasn't aiming for a love story in the first place.The second time, I enjoyed it. I changed my note to 6/10. After reading the book again in between both viewings of the film, I realized that this movie had been made this way willingly and not by mistake. I also realized that although it was different from the book in many ways ( including Solaris's appearance ), it was digging deeper into the psychological aspect of the characters than I had previously thought. Even Lem had not been able to do that in such a way.The third time, I simply loved it. I finally gave it 8/10 ( which is outstanding to me ). Like many people in here, I must have been distracted by the fact that George Clooney is in it, since he is a very famous actor and sometimes acted in horrible movies ( Batman ). I came to realize that Clooney truly outdid himself in Solaris and that all the other actors are putting an amazing performance as well. The cinematography is so beautifully done that no one can truly enjoy it through a single viewing. The soundtrack is perhaps the thing I've missed the most while I first saw this great piece of filmatography. The music is an actor itself - it remains the same, yet it changes its shape, color and tone, following the emotions represented by the images it accompanies. There is something in Soderbergh's vision of Solaris that is more otherworldly than all the sci-fi movies. Even Stanislaw Lem's original Solaris sometimes fails to describe, even with words, something similar to Steven's Solaris. Because of this, I believe Solaris not only is different - it stands alone from both the older adaptation and the book itself. It's something else.Clooney's performance which I initially saw as empty and lacking true emotion for a \"sci-fi romance\" turned out to be exactly what I just said - but in a good way. Kelvin, the character played by Clooney, is an empty shell. He has no reason to enjoy life. All that is dear to him is lost. He has no beliefs, no dreams, no hope. He comes to Solaris not as an explorer about to discover another planet with an open mind ready to plunge into the unknown with intellectual avidity, but as a professional doing his work as a psychologist, not even caring about Solaris. His love for what he believes is his loved one is not true love for it died with him on Earth. All that he cares about is the physical presence of his girlfriend and not her as a whole. In this perspective, he is indeed acting as an empty man with no real emotions and thus, he accomplishes something very few actors can actually do.This movie will always have its detractors for a reason that is also a paradox: it's the complexity of the movie that makes it simple looking to most. Many people fall in love without asking themselves what love truly is. They can live this way for a lifetime and enjoy life without problems. Solaris, however, explores love in a deeper, darker way and those who are not able to see complexity and imperfection through love will not understand the many scenes in this movie involving Kelvin and Rheya. What is love? Is it being one through sexual contact? Is it sharing thoughts, emotions and words with our mate? Or is it something else, something we have yet to discover? Most people disliked this movie because of its lack of usual science fiction elements - aliens, for example. The funny thing is that they are making the same mistake Kelvin does while not figuring out what Solaris truly is. It's all there. We, the human beings, are the aliens, for we do not even know who we truly are and what we are capable of. Kelvin cannot see Solaris in a way other than as a planet just like many people cannot see this film as something that is other than a sci-fi movie.With this in mind, I encourage you to view Solaris at least twice in a lifetime. Who knows, perhaps will you see this movie in a new light next time you see it - a purple and pink light, that is. ;)",

Jeremy Davies is fantastic, and completly steals every scene he appears in.  Natascha McElhone is perfect in her role and has just the right amounts of sexiness, mystery, and creepiness to her performance.  The score  and cinematography are both excellent.  And perhaps most importantly (to me at least) they didn't go ga-ga with the special effects and sets. Granted, most people in the theater didn't appear to agree.  Several people walked out.  I blame this mainly on the way the movie was marketed. Think of Solaris as more of an \"indie\" movie.  It's not for everyone.  If you're expecting a mindless space adventure this isn't for you.

If you are only looking for something with the depth of \"Friends\", you will want to kill yourself long before this movie is over, as I am sure you will notice in reading some of the other reviews for this movie.I'm scaring you already, aren't I? Well there is no need to be scared. Solaris is very accessible and quite engrossing, you just need the right frame of mind.In the right frame of mind you will be moved by George Clooney's rich and complex performance, haunted by Natascha McElhone's beauty and intensity, impressed by the realistic set design and understated visual effects, and intrigued by Steven Sodherberg's provocative direction of his thoughtful script adaptation. Too many adjectives? Perhaps, but this is a movie that defies being described by catchphrases and glib compliments, and that is probably why it didn't \"succeed\" in theatres.The plot setup in a nutshell: (mild spoilers ahead) At some point after his wife's (McElhone) suicide, psychiatrist Clooney is sent to a distant space station around an unusual planet, Solaris. Strange things are happening there, and the crew is becoming unbalanced. After his arrival and a couple of peculiar conversations, Clooney falls asleep and wakes up in the arms of... his wife. Solaris has recreated a version of her from Clooney's own fragments of memory. It has done something similar for the other crew.What follows through from this is an exploration of memory, loss, regret, and deep, deep love. In other roles Clooney does not necessarily come off as being a particularly deep man, but here his emotions are written on his face in vivid strokes. His confusion, pain, loss, love, hope are palpable. I was both touched and engrossed by his performance.There are surprises, but Luke Skywalker does not come crashing through a door. The ending is a true resolution, not a trite \"Ha ha we did it\" or \"Aren't we wonderful.\" This movie will keep you thinking and reflecting.I watched this film on DVD, and might have been inspired to give it 10/10 (instead of 9 for being just slightly short of a classic) if the commentary soundtrack featuring Sodherberg and producer James Cameron wasn't so annoyingly overwhelmed with assertions of how brilliant each thought the other was (Cameron was particularly bad; he just oozed b.s.). It was only intermittantly revealing and added little that a conventional second viewing would not have uncovered.",

Oh, there's plenty of conflict, but you won't see any interstellar battles, no eye candy special effects, and no sound effects in space.  What you do get is a highly 2001-influenced chamber drama about our notions of reality.An interesting film technique used by the film is prolonged shots of the female lead, which forces the audience to regard her, and the question of whether she is real or not.  It is almost as if the camera is trying to make her real, but it serves the exact opposite purpose. Ultimately, nothing is explained, and the audience must make up their own minds about it.  I though I would sleep through the film, but I got effectively caught up in the story.Everyone else in the audience seemed to exasperatedly whisper and giggle, like taking your 5-year olds to church.

            "content": "Tarkovsky's adaptation of Lem's novel takes quite a few liberties, jettisoning, for instance, the brilliant satirical elements and re-creating in its own potent terms the story's fascinating strangeness.  But Tarkovsky does remain true to the novel's central sci-fi premise: that life elsewhere in the universe may have evolved along lines so different from life on Earth that we could never fathom it.  Lem's novel, then, is an extraordinary rebuttal of all the ridiculous, anthropomorphic sci-fi scenarios in which aliens appear as strangely familiar humanoids (often demanding to be taken to some leader, in English). The new Solaris strats from the original in a far more fundamental way than Tarkovsky did, shifting the focus from the mind-bending sci-fi premise to something far more predictable and far less interesting: a rather conventional tale (told largely through flashbacks) of love, regret, and redemption.  Instead of Lem's world-wide sentient ocean, we get a few shots of some neon clouds--and virtually no explanation at all of what Solaris is.  In fact, Solaris itself becomes so peripheral to the story that one almost wonders why the filmmakers even bothered to use the name. The film will probably come as a major disappointment to fans of the original (or of the earlier film version, with its unique `Tarkovskyan' style and atmosphere).  It will also disappoint the casual cineplex viewer who expects that since Cameron's name is linked with the project that it must be some rip-roaring rollercoaster ride rather along the lines of another Aliens or Terminator II.  (Thus \"miss...miss...\")  Yes, the film's quite slow, but the slowness is not enigmatic and compelling as in Tarkovsky; it's mostly boring and often unimaginative.  And the performances certainly do not redeem the picture.  One in particular (the `dude' who plays Snow) is almost fascinating in its sheer badness. The difference between Lem (and Tarkovsky) and the new version is nowhere more apparent (or disappointing) than in the ending. In place of the fathomless ambiguities of the novel's conclusion (`I persisted in the faith that the time of cruel miracles was not past'), we get a rather saccharine, allegorical happy ending.  `Cruel miracles': no, there's nothing remotely to compare with that.  The shift toward allegory is strongly reinforced by an iconic (and rather pedestrian) visual allusion to Michelangelo.  At the same time, I suppose, one could see the scene as an allusion to Kubrick's `Star-Child'.  Throughout, the film's visual style and sudden fits of Ligeti-like music owe much more to 2001 than to anything in Tarkovsky--and to say that the invited comparison is not in the newer film's favor is a bit of an understatement. The filmmakers seem to depend on the beautiful stars to carry the viewer's interest, in lieu of the braintwisting thematic substance of the original(s).   Yes, I enjoyed watching Natascha McElhone's high-cheekboned face--in fact the main reason I stayed to the end was to find out the actress's name (since there are no opening credits).  But that's candy rather than nutrition.  I strongly recommend--especially to those who have yet to encounter Lem or Tarkovsky--that you stay home and either read the novel or rent the earlier version.  Having done both a couple of times, I still wished I had made that choice.",

Hope to see more such fabulous adaptations of great science-fiction literature.  I am sick of stupid, infantile stories, which are only the pretext for stunning special effects.

I was aware that many people had given it good reviews and i was intrigued as I am a huge fan of all types of science fiction. I am a great fan of Stanley Kubrick. One of the first films I can remember seeing was his 2001: A Space Odyssey when I was 7 years old. My parents were rather forward thinking and took me to see it on the big screen when it was originally released. That film changed the way I saw the world and the way I would look at films for the rest of my life. I can still remember the some of the content of the philosophical discussions that the adults, who saw the film with us, engaged in after the show. The questions that came up most often were \"What was the monolith\" and \"What was the effect it had on the beings it encountered?\" \"Was it a representation of God?\" Solaris is a film that I feel is trying to explore the idea of what is God and what is human? But, Solaris fails miserably in trying to provoke the same thoughts and feelings that Kubrick did so well with 2001. Solaris tries too hard to be another 2001. From the thin, plodding plot line to the loud chorale music pieces that overwhelm the sound track in a number of places, it tries to be 2001. Where Kubrick wowed us with never before seen ground breaking and realistic filming techniques that produced the spacecraft visuals, that are accompanied by beautiful Strauss waltzes, Solaris keeps showing us that same pink planet visual with the same computer generated sounding audio. After reading the book, 2001: A Space Odyssey, I was able to appreciate more the genius of Kubrick in how he showed us enough to make us think about what it was we were seeing and what it meant. Solaris tried to do the same thing, but it only bored and eventually annoyed me. How many ways can a director/writer try to illustrate the same vapid question of \"Is there a God (or creator, or supreme being) and does he care about humans, their relationships with each other, and their emotions\" Plus, 99 minutes is a little to short of a run time to even think about exploring this question. In the end, Solaris was a tedious, boring, confusing at times, uninteresting film about people I couldn't possibly care less about. What we are not shown or not told is a lot and it cripples this story and this film. Maybe I will have a different view of Solaris after reading the book, but after viewing this film I am in no hurry to spend my time reading it.",

            "content": "Human nature makes us so constricted. We want everything nicely categorized and neatly packaged. Most of all, we need to have control and understanding over everything in life, otherwise we feel frustrated and are unable to function. I am at least talking about the majority here. I would like to think that I am different, but nobody's perfect. SOLARIS is a beautiful film that is already well on its way to becoming the most underrated movie of the year thanks to the usual unsubstantiated complaints that it is boring or makes no sense. To those not used to films that stray from typical Hollywood movie conventions and to those too lazy to think or to try to interpret the movie themselves, SOLARIS would be worse than death or public speaking. To those open minded enough to understand that film is also art and can be used to convey thought, SOLARIS may be a great experience.The plot is only the set-up. Psychiatrist Chris Kelvin (George Clooney) is sent to a space station to investigate the strange behavior of the crew, with whom contact has been lost. The crew's mission was to study a mysterious planet called Solaris. Upon his arrival, Chris finds that only two people, Snow and Gordon, are still alive, while the rest of the crew either committed suicide or died mysteriously. During his first night there, Chris is visited by his dead wife, Rheya. She is not a ghost, but seemingly a real person. Apparently, Solaris is able to read people's thoughts and recreate loved-ones from their memories. The `visitors' appear how they were remembered rather than how they really were.The plot does not develop much beyond that. The film becomes a meditation on the nature of the situation. I am not sure what to make of Snow's character, but it is clear that Gordon is terrified by everything that is happening even though she does not comprehend it. She is eager to destroy the planet and any visitors without even trying to understand the situation. Chris is much more open minded, but may be going mad. In the early scenes back on earth, he is portrayed as sad and lonely. With the reappearance of his dead wife on the space station, he eagerly seeks a second chance.I think that Soderbergh has done an amazing job here especially the way he blurs the lines between reality and Chris' thoughts, memories, and dreams. The film has his usual steadi-cam style with some beautiful and fascinating images. The cinematography and haunting music were simply captivating, especially in the scene where Chris first dreams of his wife. The film is deliberately paced, but it is not slow and boring. It allowed my eyes to wander from one side of the screen to the other and completely absorb the images.I have not read the original novel or seen Tarkovsky's version so I cannot make any of those comparisons. However, 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY is one of my favorite films and SOLARIS evoked many of the same themes and recreated some of the same stunning images (while watching, I thought about how great it would be to see 2001 on the big screen). You cannot really compare SOLARIS to 2001, but I'm sure that Soderbergh was never thinking about surpassing Kubrick's film. I do think that this is his best movie along with TRAFFIC. I think he went in a different direction and succeeded on almost every level. The same can be said of George Clooney who, like Brad Pitt and Johnny Depp, is fighting his Sexiest Man in the World image with a good performance in a risky movie (although you wouldn't think so from the excessive shots of his rear end).Without getting into a specific discussion of the film's themes, the general meanings conveyed by SOLARIS relate back to what I said in the first paragraph. The film is meant to question human existence and our nature in the universe. It questions our need to explain the unexplainable and our fear of what we do not understand. It portrays humans as creatures with limitations that have a ridiculous need to always be right. I don't know if Solaris is meant to represent god or the unknown, but it is something that humans are not able to comprehend with everything we know on earth. By the end of the movie Chris realizes that he can no longer live the way he has and opens his mind to new possibilities. That may be the only way at another chance with his wife.If you feel intimidated by a thought provoking film that will force you to be an active participant and will not cater to your expectations, rent SPIDER-MAN. If you are specifically looking for sci-fi movies with gadgets and explosions then wait for STAR TREK: NEMESIS or even go to DIE ANOTHER DAY (a pretty sci-fi Bond movie). I'm sure there are people who understood SOLARIS and still disliked it. That's fine. I simply disagree with quick and irrational judgments of this film based on misinterpretations. I do not think that SOLARIS is anything completely new or revolutionary, but it felt very fresh. My enjoyment level was just about as high as it could have been throughout. I did wish it had been longer (that's right!) since it went by so fast. Maybe then Soderbergh could have gone even further with his themes. However, the threatened masses already don't know what to make of it and dismiss it as unclear or self-indulgent, so maybe it's for the best this way. SOLARIS gets a 9 out of 10.",

(Why are we obsessed with not wasting time anyway?!)This is a thinking person's film and therefore will ONLY be enjoyed for those who understand that this IS a SLOW film, meant for reflection, but it's a pleasant change to the wham bam shlock we get so fed from Hollywood, in my estimation.I'd heard so much about the Russian version which I've not been able to find yet that I was at least glad to see this version.I thought the acting was good; it kept my attention. I'm not a great Clooney fan so I wasn't so interested in his character as in the whole concept of Solaris. But I thought the parts played by the female physicist, Gordon, and the guy called Snow were both very good and the music was ethereal.Pity they changed the ending to a shmalzy happy ending one, which is not in the original, where you're left to decide for yourself what has transpired.Overall I can only give it 3/5 though.",

But this movie raises questions in the worst possible way.  Questions like, \"What were they thinking when they made this piece of crap?\" and \"I spent 90 minutes of my life watching this?\" The plot holes themselves raise dozens of questions but half-way in you stop expecting anything to make sense or tie together.  If you can make it to the end, you feel like you've taken a beating.The flaws don't stop there.  The sets are dreary and ugly.  The space station appears to be built entirely of drawers for some reason.  And the music runs the spectrum from annoying to grating.

Having said this, it's not a bad movie and a nice love story and has some interesting things, I liked all those flashbacks in particular.Anyway, if compared to the real Solaris, here's what I disliked (so be warned - SPOILERS):1) Who the f* is Gordon? Where is Sartorius? Why was he cut out? He was the most ambiguos character in the book, struggled between hating and loving the visitors.2) Where is Solaris? Lem spends half the book to describe the planet! Centuries of wasted research trying to understand that alien intelligence. Why not spend that 5 minutes to explain Solaris? It's supposed to be a SF movie, isn't it?3) Why, why, why, why had Snaut to be an aggressor? I cannot believe this! Did Soderbergh really mean it? This is definitively _not_ was Solaris is all about. And why has he forgot to talk? Nobody understands what he is saying. Incredible.4) Using the planet commercially? Sending a special forces to the space station? Argh! Why must everything be about making money and why are all space stations run by corporations? Solaris is really about search for knowledge, it is about SCIENCE fiction, Lem's station is run by a scientific community!My tip if you like SF: Watch Solaris by Tarkowsky (1972) or best: read the book!",

It is not a situation where the original was too good to be remade; rather, it is that to the extent the original worked at all was a miracle, and lightning had no way to strike twice. Soderbergh has nothing to add, no meaning to impose or new kinds of style to perk it up. He's merely taken one boring, pointless movie and made a shorter boring, pointless movie from its dropping. There are no revelations that fill in the blanks, no explanations of character or plot, or even any good action or sex to supercharge it. This SOLARIS is stolen style without substance -- or, what substance there is, just as impossible to find. It is anti-cinema of the worst kind, with lifeless performances and heavy emotions, all floating as rootless as a tree in a cyclone. Keep your head down, you don't want to get beaned by it.",

It was BORING. It moved so damn slow that it made a meager one hour and thirty minutes feel like a three hour movie. Sure it did make you think about life and all what is waiting for one after we die, but you're bored stiff to get this message. So I cannot give this movie a high score like Soderbergh's other films since it didn't hold my interest as well as, let's say \"The Limey\".And on a personal level, I know we all deal with the death of loved ones differently. But I think Chris Kelvin (George Clooney) really, really needed to get over it. When people die, they die. There's no bringing them back.SCORE: 5 out of 10 (average)",

And I must say this is a well executed and even creepy movie. It's not meant to scare you, it's not meant to wow you, it just makes you forget about everything else around you and concentrate on the central question, I would say it succeeds quite well at what it's meant to do.I loved the acting of everyone involved, and everything else is believable about the film, no fancy shots, no impossible technologies, it focuses only on the plot, and looking into anything else to find flaws involves departing the whole purpose of the film. There is a definite 2001 feel to this one, the music is somewhat evocative and just the general weirdness of the film is there too. The end gets sort of predictable once you're nearly done, but if you don't pay attention you might not understand it right away (I did but from what I read, many ppl didn't) There are many things that make this something completely new, completely out of the ordinary, it makes you ponder existence and human emotions, it captivates you.

In fact I assumed that it would actually be quite long, given that I'd seen some of the original and knew that it had a significant running time. The assumption I had was that being an American remake it couldn't possibly be anywhere near as long, but I'd still planned to be sitting in the cinema for 2 hours or more, maybe 2.5.Imagine my disappointment when it ended just 90 minutes (approx) later. I didn't want it to end, I wanted more. They didn't tell the story properly. I needed more background, more depth. For a movie that (visually) looks like it has all the pace of a snail in need of a nap, it needed more time! It moved too fast. I needed to spend more time with Clooneys reaction to his wife continuously coming back to life. I wanted to get a better sense of awe in the magnificent power of the planet below and what was happening to the crew. Too many unanswered questions. Not enough sensations.That said I was really engrossed in this film. Just the ending came too soon, which made it disappointing. I'm sure that in 5 years time we'll get the Directors Cut with the missing 30-60 minutes restored. The costume and set design was rather neat, although perhaps the clothes were a little too Vogue-ish. The Nehru neck designs of the suits flashed back to '2001'. I don't know why futurists seem to think collars will be done away with. Not that that's a big complaint. Still the overall look fits in with how I think society in 50 to 100 years will look. Which is, much like today really. Rain, pollution, supermarkets, buses, trains, grime, cooked meals, intimate dinners, libraries, book stores etc etc. No great differences, except for maybe a few more visual displays. It's probably the most realistic visualisation ever, even more so than Bladerunner. Basically, in the future, life will be ordinary.",

But some of them are by Andrey Tarkovsky, who filmed \"Solyaris\" in 1972. And I don't think I can tell right now which film is better. Sure: Tarkovsky is unique, his genius unsurpassed, probably a league of his own, while it is much easier to compare Soderbergh's work with that of others. But Soderbergh looked at Tarkovsky's \"Solyaris\" very attentively, with self-consciousness and respect. In his version, he stressed the points underdeveloped by Tarkovsky: emotional clarity, acting and closure in the screenplay (the latter not always to the best of the film). He wisely did not try to compete with Tarkovsky in fields in which he can't be beaten: visual poetry and philosophy. Tarkovsky's Kris is great, but so sullen you wonder what kind of psychologist he is to send into such an unclear situation. Clooney is much more convincing in this respect. In Soderbergh's version, people are also much less secretive about their view of the visitors and their emotions.\nSPOILERSI do not understand what people do not understand about the ending of the film. It's pretty clear: The visitors are part of Solaris, an alien intelligence. Chris stays on the station and makes contact with Solaris, embodied by the boy. The final scenes are not set on earth, but on an earth recreated from Chris memory by Solaris. He himself is not more than a memory - his original body has been destroyed during the fall of the station. Thus he overcomes the distinction between humans and visitors, and the one between real people and images. Draw from this any philosophical conclusion you want...",

It's more a drift in space with no purpose than a voyage with discoveries. I don't need any answers, but even new questions along the way are missing in this movie.

Most people consider any plot twist movie \"smart\" but there is FAR more going on in this movie then a simple plot twist ending movie.1) This IS being misadvertised as a \"chic flick\".If you want to see something like Sleepless in Seattle or What Dreams May Come you were misled by the ads, sorry.2) People say, \"nothing happens\" in this movie.That is a total load of crap.If you think \"huge explosions and gunfights = something happening\" then you are wasting your time reading my review.This is the most visual movie I can think of off the top of my head that has come out recently, I can't think of any other that comes close. THIS MOVIE IS 100% WHAT YOU SEE! Even though there is a lot of talking I would say what you ACTUALLY SEE is equally as important as the little that is said.You CANNOT go to the bathroom, talk to others, or go for more popcorn while watching this movie. Just deal and try not to blink too much.I usually check my watch in movies; I didn't do that even once through this.3)Some have said \"This movie is FAKE cause it TRYS to be deep, you are being fooled by big name actors\"Yeah Yeah like its impossible for a studio flick to have anything meaningful to say. Sure the leading lady is good eye candy, I fail to see how that makes this movie bad or \"fake\". I don't buy that a movie has to be indie to be art.4)\"Only pretentious movie viewers would like this to prove how smart they are\"(i.e. Emperors New Clothes)WRONG Sorry, this is NOT \"a bunch of pretty shots and no plot thrown together\", this movie has a great plot and makes a great point....5) You might ask \"OK FINE, THEN WHAT THE HELL IS THE POINT OF THIS MOVIE THEN!!!\"(You may consider this a spoiler)\nIt makes several points;in fact rather early on we pretty much get the point of this movie but I won't quote it as not to spoil it. You can extend this out forever but what I will try and keep it simple. As I said it raises a lot of questions:Ambiguity. We are the sum of our memories; all memories are distorted by our individual perception. None of us knows anything other then what our memory and perception tells us we know. That includes YOU in the audience.Given that we are nothing but the sum of our memories is not MEMORY & PERCEPTION equal to and/or more important then the \"real world\"?Are you a \"real\" person based on your human perception and memories? What if you have another persons memories?Does the fact that a \"dream\" world created specifically for our individual perception & memories is artificial matter when to the individual you ARE your perception and memories?The BIG BOLD statement I got from this movie: We are not ready for First Contact when we don't even understand our own minds & what an individual is.Food for thought.

This was one of the most beautifully shot movies I've seen in a long while. The story was a powerful emotional journey which asked many questions about love and life.First the look of this movie, there were so many interesting cinematographic techniques used that I was never bored looking at this movie. The scene when Clooney was at a group session but all the other people were blurry blew me away. Every scene sparked a question, a thought or an idea - what a nice change: a movie that makes you think and not just react. The story of meeting your dead loved one in a space ship above a mysterious planet prompted so many thoughts of what that would be like. Would it be desirable? Would it be everything I hoped? The feelings portrayed in this movie over feelings about a lost loved one felt so true that I thought I was watching my own story on the screen. How would I feel if my lost ones suddenly came back to me? The line that Clooney's wife says that she is only from his memory was so true and yet he doesn't care. Could I turn my back on that person even though it wasn't really her? Mind-blowing!The main criticism of the film was its pacing, some say it is slow but I prefer to say deliberate which leaves time to consider all that's happening. There isn't a lot of physical action in this movie but it's not about that. We have so many movies where all of our senses are under constant assault in order to take advantage of the new technology and not leave us bored that it is a relief to see a movie that is quiet and carefully paced so that we can ponder the questions asked. So many new movies are so frenetic that they seem afraid to show us a movie about people and ideas. Not Solaris. If you want to see a movie that's asks interesting questions while showcasing it in a fabulous looking film, check this one out. And if you like this one I highly recommend Code 46 which is just as good and underrated.",

An entity as big as a planet on the background in space has everything to do with it. The entity expands at an exponential rate so the crew tries to escape with another ship. Eventually Cloony ends up in the entity and ends up in the arms of his late wife.The director had modern technology (year 2002) at his disposal. Yet the ship is simple, nihilistic, without fantasy whatsoever. It's made of a bit of metal, metallic color, a few buttons with some integrated screens here and there. The 'entity' is a huge colored sphere with some simple lighting effects. At fundamental level there's nothing more to see Science Fiction wise.There's also a handgun on board: a device that for unknown reasons has to work at a frequency of 90 Gigaherz to permanently eliminate the projected persons they see. The weapon looks like an ill-formed microscope with tin cans here and there. High Tech lovers definitely should stay away from this move.The actors aren't beginners and George Cloony is a top actor in the eyes of many. None of them performed beyond the average though. The crew wasn't tested in any way. Acting-wise, there's nothing here to enjoy as well.Any decent critic would try to write something good and bad about the movie but I can't find anything good to write about. Even the psychological part of the movie, if you will, consists of insights even a child could think of.I rated this movie only 1 star. Because of its simplistic romantic and psychedelic approach, the way Hollywood produces all too often. Also, there was no use for this event to happen in space.

The dead person they were closest to. Referred to as the visitors.They don't know why SOLARIS is doing this, but obviously to try and study the humans that are there, to study 'it'.George Cluney's dead wife appears as his visitor.The twist is that the scientist that sounds like he is on drugs, is actually the dead twin brother (visitor) that \"SOLARIS \" created from the original. When the visitor appeared in front of his brother there was a struggle because they did not know what was happening. The original was killed and the visitor took his place without anyone knowing.The black woman scientist is experimenting on her visitor, locked in her room. She tries to find ways to kill her visitor, but the visitor is able to resurrect. She makes an energy particle accelerator that disrupts the molecular bonds that keeps the visitor intact (and also seems to resurrect them), so they can't heal.The plan is to pilot the space station back to Earth, but they must eradicate the visitors first, because they don't know what would happen if they went to Earth. They cannot be allowed to infect Earth.The visitor (twin brother of the drugged out scientist) who is piloting the space-station in orbit around SOLARIS, does not tell them that the energy particle accelerator has drained the space-station fuel cells and it is about to crash into SOLARIS, until they discover he is a visitor.The black woman and George Cluney only have minutes to escape in the small space ship that George Cluney arrived in.George Cluney imagines his life back on Earth and seems to be living it at the same time as showing us that he may have stayed in the doomed space-station.As he lives his monotonous Earth life, he cuts his finger and we see it heals by itself and then his dead wife appears. He asks the question 'how can you be here, am I alive?' They changed the ending from the Russian film, to give closure. Basically they stuffed the ending, because they could have edited it a bit better so that we did not know if he stayed on the space-station or travelled back to Earth. So his wife appearing at the end could have meant that he either died at SOLARIS and imagined he escaped, or he escaped to Earth but brought the SOLARIS infection to Earth.",

            "content": "It's a difficult job for a movie critic, or a critic of anything, when the product has artistic merit, but the method in which that product is brought forth is incredibly painful. Think of an enema that ends up looking like the Mona Lisa. `Solaris' must be the slowest, most drawn out movie to come out since Stanley Kubrick died. It even echoes Kubrick's brilliant, yet taxing, `2001.' Care and detail are given to ever pause between every word, every gesture, and every moving part of the characters, the titular planet, and the space station orbiting it. Chris Kelvin is asked to figure out what went wrong on that space station, why the crew has cut off communications with Earth. Arriving at the station, he finds two dead bodies, and two remaining crew. They are of little help. Chris goes to bed and dreams of his wife, who died some years before. He awakes to find her lying next to him, as if nothing had happened.\nThe main question posed in `Solaris' isn't whether or not she's really his wife. She's not. His wife is dead. All this new girl will ever be is a reflection of how Kelvin remembers her, not who she really was. The question is, do we ever communicate enough to ever really know someone.\nSteven Soderberg always takes an interesting approach to the idea of memory and flashbacks. One of the film's pluses is that the flashbacks aren't there to supplement the storytelling. The flashbacks, which show the young couples passionate first encounter, their playful banter as the relationship blossoms, and a few needless shots of Clooney's ass, are shown to us as the memories themselves race through Chris's and his wife's mind.\nWhile all these ideas and themes have a lot of potential, the film merely sets them up and fails to provide us with any real follow through. Chris soon becomes convinced that he can make up for past mistakes, that he has been given a second chance. This section of the film denies him all the intelligence we'd expect as he fervently tries to keep this new girl alive.\nA mistake of this movie was its wide release, where it will not find an audience. It's deep and meaningful, and it shows us insights into humanity that most movies gloss over. That's good. However, it's nearly stationary pace, repetitious visuals, and the quiet performances by the entire cast hinders its entertainment value. That's too bad. A lot of critics and filmmakers seem to forget that most people watch movies as a form of entertainment, not a as a means of mediation. The best movies are the deep, meaningful, and artistic ones that can still entertain us.",

            "review_title": "A genuine surprise",
            "content": "Very different in feel to Tarkovsky's original, this is, by Soderbergh's admission, one third the original, one third the novel (by Stanislaw Lem) and one third Soderbergh's own imagination. Its also somewhat of a departure for all involved, particularly Clooney and Soderbergh, though bearing the fingerprints of his style.It must be said that this is not the film that the terrible marketing campaign offered - it is not a funky space-set romance, though it does take place in space and is a romantic story. It is however, a very slow, deliberate film. Only essential information is given and, going from a 61-page script to a 90-minute film, there is little dialogue but a lot of detail. Many will find it too slow and possibly boring. But there is so much here to appreciate. It is a film of mood and feelings, creating a beautiful and emotional atmosphere, in which events unwind gradually, rather than an intense plot-driven mish-mash of ideas.Soderbergh's intention is to question the very nature of existence and of love - if you knew something wasn't real, would you avoid getting attached to it, even if it was the one thing you always wanted, more than anything? If it meant never seeing home again, but spending forever in a tiny space with just that person, would rationality cease to exist? Do we only need that one thing that we crave to survive? Beyond this, there are semi-religious overtones added as well - is Solaris heaven? A place where all wishes are granted at the cost of \"human\" life?The aspect that stands out first and foremost the acting. Viola Davis is wonderful, Jeremy Davies is never less than interesting, but Clooney and Natasha McElhone have never been this good. Expanding his range even more after Out of Sight and O Brother Where Art Thou?, Clooney reaches depth you wouldn't have expected of such a matinee-style star. His Chris Kelvin is sad, intense, smart and realistic - the scene where Clooney wakes up to see his dead wife is a wonderful moment of acting, watching him try to bring himself round and shake off the image, only to realise its real. And McElhone is perfectly cast and surprising as the other half of the emotional core. Having been efficient in Ronin and The Truman Show, she seems to have acquired untapped gravitas and beauty in this film, looking absolutely beautiful in a very virginal, pure sense, belying the complexities and internal grief of her character. She too has many moments that just seem incredibly real, as if she forgot to act and just believed in what was happening. The cinematography and effects are very proficient without being showy, creating a believable environment within which the bizarre events are grounded in a reality not so unbelievable. Solaris itself is simply gorgeous to look at, conjuring up images of planets and cells at the same time, hinting at a universality which is not one thing nor the other, but all things which cannot be explained in one term, again suggesting a godliness to it. And the music is brilliantly subtle, flavouring the images to give it that atmosphere of longing and loss and also beauty, never suggesting what we should feel but rather what the on-screen characters are feeling.Soderbergh has made his most mature film here, eschewing the \"cool\" editing and camera tricks of films such as Traffic, Erin Brockovich, The Limey and Out of Sight for a more stately, sophisticated tone. It never feels forced or unbelievable and, while some of its twists are somewhat predictable, you dont feel cheated at all by the end, rather that everything played out as it should: dramatic and sad in places, beautiful in others, unsettling at times and ultimately quite profound. There really isn't anything wrong with this film, if you are in the mood to have a film wash over you and cause you to ruminate on the ideas of mortality, loss and redemption. Kudos to all involved for making something slightly different.",

Well, just open the eyes and the ears : Cliff Martinez (an old Beefheart drummer and soderbergh's usual music composer) finally provides what I expected from him. After using the wonderful ethereal Michael Brook guitar delay sound in Traffic, he uses this time the Bashet 'structures sonores', amazing french percussive instruments that give a balinese/gamelan feeling to the music (and the movie). This is a most perfect collaboration between visuals and sounds, that justifies completely the slow pacing of the movie.The acting is eerie and on spot...

In this contemporary remake Steven Soderbergh takes the reigns as director, and comes up with a thoughtful and adult film that puts the intelligence back into sci-fi. This is clearly a personal work of passion, and that commitment shines through in every single shot.Dr Chris Kelvin (Clooney) is an emotionally scarred psychologist that is sent to the space station Prometheus that orbits the enigmatic planet Solaris. (In Greek mythology Prometheus is the Titan that created Man and gave them fire, without asking the permission of Zeus. He was punished for 30 thousand years by being chained to a rock and every day an eagle came and ate out his liver, which would then grow back during the night)On arrival he finds his friend has apparently committed suicide and the remaining two crew members are acting very strangely indeed. Kelvin later has a vivid dream about his dead wife Rheya, (McElhoe) who he finds alive and well in bed next to him when he wakes the following morning. The film uses this scenario to explore a plethora of ideas and philosophical issues such as the meaning of life, religion, God, love, as well as what it is that defines a human. Thankfully there is plenty of time for the audience to ponder these issues due to the slow pace and long scenes with no dialogue at all.The restrictive narrative means Clooney fills practically every scene, which works superbly well as this is an emotionally complex film about one mans struggle to come to terms with his wife's death, his memory of that event, and then her unsettling return from the grave. Clooneys performance is fantastic, especially as the wounded widower that is stripped of the twinkly eyed charm (and sometimes his clothes) that we see in the dreamy flashback sequences. This allows him to deliver a raw and vulnerable performance of a man totally heart broken from past experiences.McElhoe is equally as outstanding (and remarkably beautiful) as his mentally unstable wife who has her own difficulties in coming to terms with her existence and place in the universe. The special effects used are of a high standard and used wisely. The space station is a solid and functional stage for the story to be performed on, where as the planet Solaris is a visual feast of exquisite beauty, with mesmerising electric pinks and blues that will literally bring a tear to your eye. It will not appeal to every one. I watched at least two couples leave the already barren cinema, and my girlfriend fell asleep in my lap However, it is a great film for those of us who want more than passive popcorn entertainment, and really should be seen on the big screen. This is an extremely well made, surreal, and philosophical, treat that will pose a lot of questions and hopefully touch your soul. As one of the characters says \"There are no answers, only choices\". Choose to see this film.",

Atmospheric cinematography, excellent photographic compositions, nice music and, most of all, great performances by George Clooney and Natasha McElone, plus a unique 'Snow' character, make this film the best sci-fi movie of the decade. In fact, I didn't know that Clooney could perform so well. The only misfortune of this film is that bears the burden of being a 'remake', so people who have appreciated Tarkovsky's unique style (although with its drawbacks) will feel as if they 'knew' the end.

Kelvin makes the choice to remain on Solaris with this \"wife\" whom he knows is not really her.  The existential satisfaction of having his life with her back, even as a fiction, counts for more than accepting the truth and leaving Solaris.Kelvin is a tragic figure because he cannot transcend himself, his own desires and his own perception.  Instead he gives in to it.\nWhat is frightening about this film is that it is a metaphor for the human condition in general.  It says we are all like Kelvin, trapped in a world of our own perceptions, and that all that really matters is whether we are happy with what we percieve or not.  Solaris gives Kelvin not his deepest desire, but the perception of having that desire.  He makes the choice to accept that, and the movie invites us all to give up on Truth, Responsibility, and Purpose, and just live in a personal world of our own psychological comfort zone.One is reminded of the scene in _The Matrix_ where the main character is offered the blue pill or the red pill. The Red Pill is Truth, the Blue Pill allows him to wake up tomorow morning back in his own bed in that fake \"Matrix\" world, none the wiser.  In that movie, the main character chooses the Red Pill and Truth, even though it is painful.  In this movie, Kelvin chooses the Blue Pill, and the lie, just because it is psychologically satisfying.This is a great film, as to directing, cinematography, acting etc. and will be an art house classic.

Dreaming prompts the re-appearance of crew members' loved ones - Clooney's dead wife re-appears in the form of the rather gorgeous Natascha McElhone - and we have a meditation on the nature of these recreated 'people', and how one should relate to them. Western religions preach the everlasting nature of the soul, which would mean that we will one day be in Clooney's character's position; disturbing and absurd, I think, but interesting to consider how this could work (I don't think it could!). It's true that similar themes have been explored many times in sci-fi, but they are universal concerns so bear repeating.",

Andrey Tarkovsky's Solaris is spaceless, while Steven Soderberg's an intense gravitational field, with a pull to the material world.

The play of light and shadows in the space stations are as flawless as the falling space craft, in perpetual drop with out a nudge in degree or motion. A digital score that plays with the senses, giving the atmosphere curiosity and hope. Dr. Kelvin arrives to the ship, disciplined and concerned, following a trail to a member of the board, who in turn comments \"how about that\" when the mentions of odd circumstance are hinted at. A comic effect in deception is raised to concern, when the serious anger of Dr. Gordon brings forth experience with the state of solaris. The crew becomes spaced-out with ascertain beguile by an unknown power, while the crew is trying to figure out what is happening. In solaris, while they sleep, guests of the past glide in their reality. Dr. Kelvin, is visited by his loved one, who takes the blame for her departure. Memories of intimacy & poetry, as they share verses. Bitter fights & play, as she puts a dress on him. Rhea is a feline of a woman, she gets so close, you can touch her and you allow yourself, smell her. It is interesting to note, Solaris is a piece of work. Complex with the minimum of dialog to explain phenomena. the use of few characters in the interplay of an enclosed structure, in perfect pauses with facial expressions, replacing dialogue. Like the score, like the view of solaris, used detailed for maximum effect.",

Or, rather, our inability to understand our own nature alienates us from ourselves and others. Solaris is the mysterious workings of the human psyche. All the desolation and chaos therein stem from our efforts to either destroy or abandon what we can neither understand nor control.Chris Kelvin is able to communicate with it by probing his own mind. Essentially, his private thoughts, memories and dreams are reproduced in a physical form that he can actually speak to and reason with. Unfortunately, this physical manifestation of his imagination, Freya, is all too human in that it has no knowledge of what created it. To go beyond this limitation and truly understand our own origins, it is necessary to become one with Solaris. But, possessed by an almost paranoid fear of the unknown, Chris is reluctant to surrender himself unconditionally. That is, until he finally realizes that in order to grow as an individual, he needs to share his experiences with others. In effect, Chris needs love.For all our great knowledge, the origin of life has remained a mystery. And, if we do not even know what life is to begin with, how can we ever expect to find it elsewhere in the cosmos? To fulfill our own destiny, we must journey not through space, but rather through the timeless void that is our own subconscious. Life, after all, is a physical manifestation of thought, and with the power of our imagination we will forever preserver, and ever be capable of raising ourselves to ever still higher levels of conscious.",

I thought to myself that it might be one to avoid. So I avoided it.Then I saw George Clooney being interviewed on the BBC and he was saying that Solaris hadn't been greatly recieved by American audiences. This made the movie a must see and so I acquired it and watched it.It might be the version I got or something but there were no credits at the start of the picture. It just started, just like that. And when it started it was immediately obvious that this wasn't going to be a straight forward story.The story itself was not necessarily important, not as important as the issues explored. The issues addressed were about humanity, regret, and what it might be like to meet something truly alien. This last concept was pulled off brilliantly, as while watching the movie kept you on the back foot. Although science is given some lip service during the movie what is experienced by the characters is clearly beyond human comprehension and beyond science too. Although there is no sense of metaphysics going on there is a sense of philosophical enquiry. This is high-brow, serious science fiction then; a rarity in these times.The look of the movie I would describe as harking back to the style of 70's sci-fi movies but with 21st century CGI. This was really brought home right at the end of the movie when the credits rolled. Lovely 70's style font and the mainstay of the credits rolling as though they should have been at the start.This movie is in the same league as Logan's Run, Silent Running and the ilk.\nI was pleasantly surprised by the movie because I thought it was going to be Hollywood's usual thing of killing off any interest by explaining everything. It didn't. The audience was allowed to work it our for themselves. I thought it was going to be a trashy romance in space. It wasn't that either.It was just what it was. A proper science fiction movie.\nI give this movie 7 out of 10.",

            "content": "I am a big fan of Andrei Tarkovsky, and I must say I was absolutely NOT disappointed by the re-make.  It is an excellent example of how Science Fiction CAN be intelligent, and while not completely a re-make of the Tarkovsky film to the frame, and different from the book, it absolutely retains the spirit of these works, while adding a few of its own twists.I know that this film hasn't exactly set the box office on fire and many of the multiplex crowd are running from the exits clutching their heads in pain, but I have one question to North America...  Are we really THAT stupid?  Come on, this film merely gives us a beautifully ambiguous dream experience that is not all that dense beyond the fact that it is based on emotion rather than logic.  I mean come on, must every movie be so logical that there is NO room left for an audience to use their imaginations, and have FUN with ambiguity?  MULHOLLAND DRIVE was an excellent example of how recent movies can not give you all the answers and work.  But that film was embraced, and this one, because it was done by a guy like Soderburgh and features Clooney seems ripe for the picking because it will attract audiences that are only there to see a movie star's ass.Very silly for the marketing departments at Fox, who obviously had no clue what to do with such a beautiful and poetic film, that they handled the film completely wrong.  This film should have opened slow and small then grown with word of mouth, not thrown out with 2,400 prints on a Wednesday!  I know it is an expensive movie, but now they have killed any momentum it might have had, at least in North America.  Hopefully for its international release, a more thoughful campaign and strategy will be used.Overall, I couldn't be more impressed and pleased with this film, from the superlative directing, acting, cinematography, music and production design, this one works full force.And the irony is that it's not even HALF as dense as the classic film Tarkovsky made of the book years ago.  So if a simplified version of such a story is getting so many audience members screaming in confusion and boredom, how are even more marginal films going to survive?  It's getting more and more difficult to see interesting, intelligent genre films that don't feature kung-fu fights and machine gun battles between their new ideas.Guess it will continue to get tougher.  I am at least one person who will continue to support and love intelligent and progessive genre cinema.Hope there's more like me.",

I've seen it a number of times now, and it is a movie that completely understands itself, understands the depth of the questions it's asking, and pays respect to the audience in the simple, lyrical terms of pure film.

The music score is as mesmerising as the action, in fact there is no action, just feelings. Tarkovsky dealt more with knowledge and science and the moral of men of science trying to discover and exploit and where is the truth and where does man fits in. It had to do a lot with love and memory too. This is what this film is about: the setting is not important, it is just a mise-en-scene, it is just a stage, where memories are observed and relived, where love expands through time. we get used so quickly to science-fiction meaning special effects, and maybe we should go back and watch the original solaris and 2001 space odyssey etc...

The answer obviously lies in our society's apparent need to dismiss any thought-provoking film's ability to entertain, and Steven Soderberg's Solaris is one such effort. \nMy enjoyment of this 99 minutes of superb cinema lies in its living, breathing organic structure that mirrors the passion and unpredictability of true love.  This film intends to appeal to an audience's sense of exploration and emotion on many levels, and not necessarily in one viewing. Immediate comparisons that come to mind are Ridley Scott's `Blade Runner', Steven Spielberg's `Minority Report' \u0096 even touches of director Nicolas Roeg's early works are present in the sometimes non-linear, flashback storytelling structure.The ensemble casting and acting is fine throughout, particularly Viola Davis' sure portrayal of Helen Gordon, which brought to mind Sigourney Weaver's raw, emotional Ellen Ripley in 1979's `Alien'.  The entire cast interacts with a sense as instinctual as a relay team passing a hand baton. \nGeorge Clooney's Chris Kelvin feels completely authentic, and his true believability and sense of emotional depth are at the core of what makes Solaris work.  His other half in this worldly examination of love \u0096 actress Natascha McElhone - is perfectly cast as wife Rheaya Kelvin. Their chemistry facilitates the audience's need to believe in the intimacy of their relationship.  The story cannot work without believing in this marriage, and the scenes that establish the union are truly naturalistic, almost voyeuristic in execution.Solaris is forward thinking in everything it explores \u0096 Soderberg confidently tells this story with a knowing that audiences will catch up with his total senses storytelling style \u0096 if not now, certainly at some point in the not so distant future.",

But moreso than any other film I've seen this year, it gave me pause to consider those moments in life which we would take back if that were somehow possible....the careless disregard, a glib but ignorant statement carelessly made to a loved one in a thoughtless moment or a poorly crafted effort to cause hurt.

This movie challenges us to sit still for a minute and really listen to what the characters are saying and what it could possibly mean.

I loved the touch of making one of the scientists a strong black woman. I watched the original Russian version (1972) before trying to digest the newer one. The newer one resonated with me more. Perhaps because it is more current - perhaps because the in Russian version I had more trouble understanding the timelines and how they fit it - until the end.

And that is not at last because of the very subtle, but never the less brilliant performances given. Like this, Solaris chooses a highly unique approach to deliver such a complex message - and it works. The slow narration will take you deeper and deeper into the emotional world of its characters to confront you with essential questions. It is all about the strive for an identity as self conscious being and about the sense behind any effort in life:\"It's the puppet's dream... being human.\" Creating and developing your self, by choosing images of possible pasts and futures to pursue. By confronting its characters with emotional situations and choices that would never be possible in any lifetime, the movie reduces its' considerations towards one question: \"What are we here for?\"\"There are no answers, only choices!\"If you can not see the richness of this answer all at once, you might want to think about Sartre's \"Being and Nothingness\" or Camus' \"The Myth of Sisyphus\" or how Camus could claim that \"I do not believe in god and I am not an atheist!\".

            "content": "Some Spoilers are here.Solaris is a sci-fi love story. I already hear the collective groans of a populace conditioned to expect violence and 1 dimensional characters in their sci-fi genre. But Solaris isn't interested in alien civilizations or in a far away time where science has taken the \"man\" out of human. It is very much about the humanity of the proceedings and if you don't dig that well...this isn't for you.We follow the journey of Kelvin(George Clooney in a stunning turn from his usual performances). Kelvin is a staunch atheist \"realist\". He is sent to a spacecraft that is studying a planet called Solaris. It seems that the crew on Solaris are having deep mental issues and Kelvin is a renowned shrink. Kelvin's friend was the lead scientist on the ship and he has committed suicide. Kelvin is supposed to be the objective assessor of the problems on board. The only catch is that neither he nor anyone on Earth have any idea what is really facing the crew. Now that could be a set up for the next Alien picture where the climax involves Clooney and the crew kicking ass and taking names. Not here. Solaris isn't a goo dripping monster. Solaris is a very benign looking beautiful planet that just exists with only one catch. Those near it are being visited by dead relatives, friends, etc. This is where the story begins. We see through Clooney's \"ghost\" a tragic romance in the making. Clooney is visited by his deceased wife and through flashbacks and conversations between the two we find out that she had mental issues and committed suicide. I won't go into all of the hows and whys of the suicide but needless to say it is a great story told faithfully by the movie.Kelvin can't see past his own love and feelings of guilt over his wife's death. Gordon the lead scientist on the trip can't see past her paranoia and fear. In a few short days Kelvin goes from supposedly helping the crew deal with their issues to exposing himself as the one with the deepest problems of them all. The questions that are posed are gigantic and the answers to those types of questions can't really be answered in a movie. Knowing this the film never insults us with cheeky solutions. What is life? Kelvin posits that Gordon is a murderer when she \"kills\" one of the visitors he is saying that existence is all that matters not origin or circumstance. Is it murder? The movie doesn't even begin to say. Kelvin it seems to me was already dead. He died with his wife and he was simply going through the motions of existence. The other character in this piece is Snow who happens to be my favorite character. Snow we come to learn is actually from Solaris. We start out and he is the most human and compassionate of all the characters and at the end we discover that he was the real Snow's visitor and had to kill him in self defense. What does that say? Again the movie leaves it up to us with the confidence that we'll figure that out for ourselves.The movie isn't easy to love. It is slow and contemplative. It never spoon feeds or coddles the viewer. You'll have to put in your own work to enjoy it. Just because it takes place on a spaceship and in the future does not mean it will have a lot of action or explosions. It is simply a study of life and love set in the future with creepy undertones. What is Solaris? The movie never definitely says what the motives of Solaris is. In fact when Clooney asks his apparition friend what Solaris wants he is merely answered with a rhetorical \"What makes you think it has to want something?\". It isn't for everyone but if it is your style you will indeed love it with a vengeance.",

            "content": "A most amazing thing occurred when I sat down in my theater to watch Steven Soderbergh's sci-fi remake, 'Solaris'. The majority of the theater was women, no small part I'm sure to George Clooney and the promise to see his posterior not once, but twice. As the film progressed I kept hearing the rattling of seats and the exit doors. When the lights came back on more than half my theater had walked out on 'Solaris'. I have never seen this many walk outs for any film before, and if one has to hold this title 'Solaris' certainly does not deserve this dubious honor.Clooney plays Chris Kelvin, super future psychologist who is struggling to overcome the grief over the suicide of his wife, Rheya (Natascha McElhone). Clooney is dispatched to a space station orbiting the mysterious glowing planet Solaris. Seems strange goings on, are, well, going on. When he arrives he finds that the station head has taken his own life and the two remaining crewmembers on board could use more than a few hugs.Clooney goes to sleep (in a bed resembling bubble-wrap) and is startled awake when his dead wife is suddenly lying right beside him. But is it his wife? Is it merely his memories being recounted? Is it Solaris messing with his gray matter? Does Rheya have consciousness of the past or of her self? What are her thoughts on her new materialization? Good luck Steven Soderbergh, existentialist party of one.It's not that 'Solaris' is necessarily a bad film, it's just that it's plodding, mechanical and overly ambitious. There are long periods of staring, followed by brief exposition, then more staring, sometimes earnestly but mostly slack-jawed. 'Solaris' is attempting to be an existential meditation on identity and self, but what really occurs is a lot of nothingness. For a movie that was over three hours in its original 1971 Russian conception, and a mere 93 minutes in its slimmer Soderbergh size, I could likely get this movie done in 6 minutes. It could be argued that its arduous pacing amplifies its methodical subject matter, but whatever.Clooney has said in interviews how Solaris was the most challenging role of his career. To this I make a collective psssha noise of disagreement. Clooney turns from grief-stricken to confusion, then back to grief-stricken with nary a line of dialogue. The effect is more dampening than emotional.I'm very pleased to see the glassy-eyed, apple-cheeked beauty McElhone in movies again. She seemed to be on the cusp of mainstream acceptance after prominent roles in 1998's 'Truman Show' and 'Ronin', yet she just disappeared. McElhone is a wonderfully expressive actress and deserves to be a leading lady.Soderbergh's take on existential dread could be described as a noble failure. 'Solaris' is the type of overreaching, underachieving film only really talented people could make. And for anyone wanting to leave after the double dose of Clooney's derriere, they both happen in the first 30 minutes. You can go after that.C+",

            "content": "It has been years since I read Stanislaw Lem's Solaris, many years. I have always though considred him to be (ever since I have acquiered a cursory glance into 20th Science Fiction) to be an absolutely seminal author. Coincidentally, fairly recently I reread Star Diaries (four months ago) which confirmed this sentiment in my mind. But when I sat to Watch Solaris (2002) I could not recall much more than the basic premise. Which was not so much a bad thing.Having said that about the novel, it is also appropriate to mention in this respect that it has been nearly as long since I have seen the movie Solaris (1972). I do not recall much of Andrei Tarkovsky's film, except that it was really good, I would not doubt that it warrants the title of masterpiece as many IMDB reviewers seem to suggest, and in fact I must see that and soon. But I digress, this is about Steven Soderbergh seemingly-already under-rated film. But just to reiterate, I went to see Solaris (2002) with an impression-ed mind, while at-the-same-time, not having clear comparisons (aside from recalling that the novel and the movie which followed it were very good).So what about Steven Soderbergh's Solaris? It is good, very good. Near-masterpiece I dare say (though not outright). I was highly moved by it for its many qualities - some of these qualities doubtful would exist had Soderbergh's compromised with the film vis-\u00e0-vis popular culture need for fast-impacting (& fast-forgotten) action-ism. To his credit Soderbergh chose to treat Solaris with the respect it deserved.George Clooney plays an excellent, and in spite the whatever-female demographic-inspired bare bottom at several scenes, delivers a solid and moving performance. Likewise Natascha McElhone. The rest of the cast does not fair to badly either.The cinematography is exquisite. Colourful, atmospheric, etheric, sharp, obscured all follow a well-crafted cinematic flow. The sight of Solaris (the planetary entity) is truly awe-inspiring. The music is another important quality which makes this an excellent film and helps in blending the audio and visual in audio-visual as virtually all good (not to mention great) movies do.As for the story, this is Stanislaw Lem and enough said about that. But as for the screenplay and dialogue, it seems to be quite decent, though unfortunately I could not compare these to neither the novel nor Fridrikh Gorenshtein's adaptation of which. All considered, I was ultimately satisfied with these.The only shortcoming that, in my view, cause the film to fall short in being a masterpiece outright is some redundancy in scenes. I cannot really name any specific ones, but it was almost as-if there were some disjointedness in terms of the otherwise excellent flowing-ness of the movie - especially in some of the scenes involving Kelvin's recollection. This is strange as the movie is really brief. Perhaps more than mere redundancy, what I am thinking is an over-emphasis on Chris and his adversity, his memories of his former life with Rheya get ample screening time, while her(s) own struggle with who-what she is, recieves some attention, but not nearly as much. It was almost as if the movie was afraid of leaving the realm of being 'human' (or beyond-human, a-human, etc.) for too long, and attempted to avoid excessively 'frightening' the viewer with the uncertainties, contradictions and paradoxes that characterizes so much of Lem's work, whose aim is the-beyond, of mixing tragedy and humor, pathos and absurdity, the silly and the profound .  For many people these sorts of contemplations are far more terrifying than crazy, slimy-looking and outright rude and impolite (not to mention eeevil) aliens. So I could see why this may have been a consideration. Then again, it might not have been. I am walking on a thin rope here in this respect until I reread the book/watch the 1972 adaptation (which I will, this movie has motivated me to do so, which is also to its credit), but I'll, nonetheless, stick to these somewhat intuitive tendencies. But I digress yet again.I also cannot but notice, in this extension, that the Soviet cast lists Khari prior to Kris Kelvin, while the reverse is true here. Not necessarily a drawback, but somewhat peculiar. It does leave me even more motivated to watch the 1972 version and read the novel.Notwithstanding these actual drawbacks, peculiarities and/or potential drawbacks, this movie should be seen as a success. As an achievement to be proud of. For the thoughtful science fiction -reader- it delivers not only entertainment, but also quality art.\n=====Summary:===== I enjoyed watching Solaris (2002), it has replayability value; it is thoughtful and it is moving. It might have had a chance to become a great and even epochal film, but falling short of that, there is very little (or anything) in Solaris that would equate as 'boredom'. Solaris strengths more than make up for whatever shortcomings and lifts it far-above the ordinary sci-fi movie. I highly recommend it without any hesitations or misgivings. It is a worthwhile, able, and all-in-all quite an excellent film. Could have been a masterpiece, but the result, (whether mere or sheer) excellence, should satisfy most science fiction fans who are tired of the plotless fight-evil-aliens routine. Those, then, who desire something which possesses some of the depths, the sophistication which seminal works such as Lem's grant us - these sort of movie-watchers will not regret spending their time and money on this excellent film.8.5-to-9.0 / 10.00",

            "content": "OK, What a great film, although I am the first to admit that is wasn't the easiest to follow (I think I just about got it), It was amazing. The set and simply dialogue is 2nd to none of the films I have seen so far this year. As both a Clooney and Soderbergh fan I was more than a little excited about this film, but after hearing such horrible reviews and comments from American I was more than a little nervous about seeing it. Was this gonna be the movie to turn me away from Soderbergh or simply love him even more? It was definitely the second. As for the acting I thought that the show was stolen by the unnerving performance by Jeremy Davies. And the brave acting and brilliant interpretation of a women with nothing but the projected image of herself was carried out amazingly well by Natascha McElhone, an actress who I had not come across before.Anyway, back to the point off this comment. Although I have seen some pretty weird films and really enjoyed the fact that I am left we the feeling of 'What the hell just happened?', not a bad feeling, but I like a film that makes me question myself and the world in which I live, something that 'Solaris' doesn't fail to deliver. I have read various reviews and I'm slightly put off by the fact that no one else seems to have seen the film in a similar way that I did. The common theory I have heard is one similar to maybe 'The Matrix'. My theory (and please remember that I have not seen the original so can't compare in any way) is that Solaris was a kind of metaphor for the state of mind that a person enters after someone close to them dies. George Clooney, like anyone who loses someone close to them has a choice to make, move on and live without them, or refuse to be able to live in a world that doesn't include the person that you love. I think that the return of Natascha McElhone is symbolic for the way that people relive sections of their life before their loved one died, the fact that the way Clooney remembers McElhone effects her is true to the way people question their memories. The ending when Clooney has returned to earth and once again McElhone appears, I think shows that Clooney choose that he could not live without his wife and was willing to sacrifice his life in order to be with her forever.I would really love to hear any comments about what other people thought of 'Solaris' and whether or not anyone out there agrees with me in the slightest.Final note: See this film, it's gonna be huge!!!",

The theme (what is reality; to what extent are we real; how is love affected by our perception of reality) should be of fundamental interest to everybody, but of course isn't.\nThe casting and acting are more than excellent; the directing is vintage Soderbergh, i.e. original and very good. Name your aspect (sound?), and it is simply very well done. The visuals are stunningly beautiful.\nProbably why people so far have rated it so low (6.5, ridiculous!) is that it is not always clear how scenes should be interpreted. This is way beyond good guy meets good girl encounters bad guy kills bad guy and good guy and good girl live happily ever after. Since the film personae don't wear white hats and black hats, one doesn't always know from the first moment what to think of them. If that bothers you, please avoid this movie. Or as Steven Soderbergh says in his commentary on the DVD - if you don't like the first ten or fifteen minutes, stop watching, for it doesn't get any better.So far I have seen it twice, the second time with the commentary by Steven Soderbergh and James Cameron (how could you get a bad movie when these two join forces?) and I am looking forward to seeing it many times to come.Steven, I am amazed how different your movies can look from one to the next, while maintaining such a level of excellence.

            "content": "I'm not a big fan of Tarkovsky's Solaris. It's not too deep philosophically, although it's stunning visually. Lem himself didn't like Tarkovsky's film, and the reasons are clear. His novel is first of all a _science_ fiction masterpiece about Man and the Unknown, about the limits of science, about science and ethics. Most of the novel's depth was lost or trivialized by Tarkovsky. However, his film is truly haunting visually, and its imagery is unforgettable.Well, it's only by seeing this abomination that I started to really appreciate Tarkovsky. Soderberg's film is an amateurish reenactment of the classic with slightly better lighting and more expensive sets. Its faithfulness to the original is pathetic; it inherits all of the problems of Tarkovsky's film but adds absolutely nothing of its own. It just makes it worse - much worse.It's especially dreadful when you compare the heroine. Tarkovsky's Harey is incredibly beautiful, airy, touching, loving and lovable - she almost made me cry. Soderberg's Rheya is old, ugly, awkward, and delivers her lines with such cheap melodramatism that it made me cringe. In one scene, her saying \"Oh my god\" twice - with a tear! - was such an unbelievable soap that I nearly vomited.Clooney copies Banionis laboriously but seems to forget that he's supposed to be an actor, and actors don't normally wear such wooden faces. Snow (\"Snaut\") is actually somewhat funny (the best actor in the entire film, by far), though totally out of place. The black female \"Sartorius\" is passable but just barely.Perhaps the only reason to remake Solaris now might be to create the real Ocean, with all its complexity and unpredictability, the way it described in Lem's book. Tarkovsky could not do that due to the obvious technical limitations of 1972, and it looks like he wasn't interested in that part of the novel anyway. Yet, it's hard to believe that Solaris of 2003, with all the computer technology and whatnot, shows an even less impressive Ocean than Solaris of 1972. What did they spend the money on, I wonder? One point where Soderberg departed from Tarkovsky is the ending. Tarkovsky's ending, different from that of the novel, was striking and original. Soderberg's ending, different from that of the novel, is silly and soapish.Overall, it all feels like an unfunny parody.",

My first thought was to just go with Die Another Day. Even if the plot was weak, at least there'd be lots of cool gadgets, girls and stunts to keep me entertained. But in the end, I tried to take the high road and go for the supposedly more artistic and thought provoking Solaris.This movie is slow. And quiet. Long pauses and little music. I'm sure there was an intention for that, but I don't think it was to make me fall asleep, which it almost did a few times. I also saw about 4 people walk out of the already pretty empty theater. Based on what I've read online, I'm not the only one to experience this. I realize it's supposed to be artsy and all, but this version of the movie was made in America, by Americans, foremost for distribution in America. They have to think about what people are willing to sit through. I think this story could have been told in 30 minutes if you took out all the dramatic pauses. Or the ideas should have just been left in the novel. If people are falling asleep or walking out (or even worse, sleep-walking out) then someone dropped the ball here.Those that liked Solaris explain away the critics by saying they just didn't understand it. Well, I like to think I'm pretty intelligent. In fact, I went to this movie just so that I could have a deep talk about it afterwards with the person I saw it with. But when it was over, I had nothing to say. Sure, it made me think about some things, to which I just said, \"Okay, so what?\" The ending just didn't hit me like some other movies have done with their deep surprise endings. I think I summed up the movie well on the way out of the theater when I said, \"Do you think there's still time to catch the Bond movie?\"",

There are no traditional antagonists in this film; Chris' greatest enemy is a burden of conscience that he carries with him, the presence of which weighs down his soul and clouds his judgment. Initially, he doesn't believe his visitor is Rhea. Later, he no longer cares. The presence of someone who looks, feels, and sounds identical to his dead wife gives him an opportunity to assuage the pain of misplaced responsibility. The number of \"thinking\" science fiction films is small, and most are produced on small budgets for start-up directors.

            "content": "I'm traumatized. I need to be sedated or put out of my misery.The most excellent s-f book I've ever read had been turned into... into... have no idea what it has been turned into but it HURTS. They say the movie is 'deep' and 'spiritual'. It could have been if it was something original, if it didn't happen to be based on the book so great and DEEP and SPIRITUAL.So, what was that bad about the movie? Ummmm\u0085. EVERYTHING?! 'K, no, George was fine, as he always is. He's not a good actor, he's a great actor but neither him or his buttocks could save Solaris. It died right before my eyes. *sheds a tear* Major SPOILERS to both the movie and The Book.God, I have no idea where to begin with, I don't really have a week to describe all that was wrong. Fine, the main issues would be it: First of all, the movie is a one gigantic chaos. It seems cut, jumps from one time frame to the other, there's no fluentness between scenes. I understand it's deliberate but it's more annoying than anything else. Plus, it really doesn't help that they cut out half of the book and then they hint at us that those things happened but we just didn't witness them. It creates a bloody mess, people! If I didn't read the book I wouldn't have the slightest clue what is going on! And no, it's not the typical 'if we showed it, we wouldn't have time to show the rest' case, because they have time for those pointless flashbacks and George's naked buttocks... ... ...ok, can't blame them for THAT.Yes, babes, they cut out everything about Solaris!!! What the ...!?!?!?! The book was about it, just look at the title for God's sake. What the hell, tight budget? If you paid George Clooney to show his naked buttocks around, I'm sure you could find a penny or two for some special effects. I wanted to see symetriads! And mimics! You just can't take Hamlet, decide that he can go and make the play without him. O_o Perhaps that makes me so angry. I LOVED SOLARIS - The Ocean, loved the theories, the musings, the mystery, the thrill, the unknown... but all I got was a dull romance/pseudo-psychological thingy. I had 4 favorite scenes and hoped that at least one will make it to the movie. It did not.Other things they changed? Well, that's the thing. Parts of the movie were fascistically accurate with the book, while lots of those so called Significant Details were changed. Names. They changed names. Why?! They changed sexes. WHY?! They changed Fat Black Woman into The Son but that I expected to happened. They TOTALLY changed the ending The only good thing, really, because I was not pleased with the ending in the book, seems like there was none but the fact that it turned that in here we've got A Hollywoodish Happy Ending made my stomach turn. The thing about the book was that from the beginning we were aware that Happy Ending is not possible and here? Oh, blah! Hahaha, know what really is amusing? Apparently, in the movie, the answer to everything is the fact that Solaris is alive. Well, in the book we find out about that on the 3rd page, we are just not sure what kind of 'life' is that. Is Solaris super-intelligent or is this some primordial soup? Is it the end of the evolutionary journey or just the beginning? Is it evil? Good? Can we even use those terms to describe it? What does it want? Does it want anything at all? What are we to it? Is it even aware of our presence? We don't get he answers, just theories and in the movie? 'OMG! What's going on?!' 'It's Solaris, it's alive' 'Oh, that explains everything' *headdesk* I could survive everything, the changes, the ending, the chaos but I will never forgive them, that they turned such intelligent, interesting, fascinating and thrilling story into a bad romance.One more thing, Dear People That Turned The Book Into The Movie.Next time, if you get confused what the book is about, look at the title, it might give you a clue. The book was called 'Solaris' for a reason, the main reason being Solaris, which the book was about. The title of the book was not, I repeat, it was not 'How I Met Loved My Wife'. If it still doesn't help, TRY ASKING THE AUTHOR WHAT HE MEANT BY IT, OK?!",

The movie has many differences from the book, however once you read the book, you realize, that it has many interpretations and many sides. I think Soderberg understood the book well. The character's motives and beliefs in the movie are pretty much identical to the ones in the book. It also has the same melancholic and surreal concept. The movie, beside being a sci-fi mystery, thriller is actually a genuine love story. But it is not about the love we hope to meet in another person, but about the love we long to discover within ourselves and then understand it. At least I interpret it that way.The movie is also a standard on its own for a good cinematography - lighting, make-up, scenes, and of course - very good acting.",

I presume he does it so it allows the viewer to build up their own take on who and what the characters are, but it fails utterly in this endevour.If this film had been an episode of the outer-limits or star trek and a decent tv-movie director of the likes of Cliff Bole had filmed it, it would have been a 100% better film. Instead, with Steven Speilberg producing this film, millions of dollars are spent on a brilliant set which is of no consequence to the story because there isn't one.Instead you are left with a bunch of characters in a space station orbiting some \"weird pink planet\" who you don't care about one bit, or feel for because they are so shallow, so poorly acted (due to the script is so bad) and the only saving grace is the soundtrack which just about describes the mood of the painting Soderbergh is trying to create.Unfortunately the paint ran and it produced a horrible looking pink bit of film that was the biggest waste of 90minutes my life has had.Atleast I hired the dvd and didn't buy it.

Soderbergh and his incredible team should be commended for creating such a splendid, miraculously crafted triumph of modern sci-fi cinema. This is science fiction with class, style, and atmosphere. If you are not appreciative of slow cameras and dialogue, do not see this movie. Now, for people with taste, let me tell you what you are in for: a thoroughly enjoyable emotional space opus designed for adult-minded people with a sense of wonder to spare. George Clooney is a psychologist sent to a remote planet's space station to investigate the strange occurrences affecting the crew. Steven Soderbergh continues to dazzle with his eclectic palette of films, and is quickly on his way to becoming a legendary director. George Clooney proves he can really act in this one, with bouts of emotions rarely seen in his usually pretty-boy demeanor. Natascha McElhone shines as the wife. The supporting cast includes Jeremy Davies, Ulrich Tukur, and Viola Davis, all of whom provide exceptional dramatic support. The sets, costumes, ships and the planet itself are wonders to behold. This film is an unforgettable experience. Nothing like it has been made since \"2001: A Space Odyssey\". The film is serious, odd, haunting, and bold. You should consider yourself blessed to see a film this delicate in today's world of cinematic drivel. Thank you Steven Soderbergh! 10/10",

Since \"ER\" I have no particular fondness for Clooney, so that doesn't help. McElhone is good in the role of, what ever it is, but, as with the rest of the script, the dialog is choppy.

This movie has done a very good job of capturing the mood of the novel. I read quiet a few reviews here that are crying about the movie being slow and hard to understand. If you want an easy to watch sci fi film , go see Nemesis (not to say that Nemesis is a not a great movie, it is). Then there are those of you who start dissing the novel. Solaris is considered one of the greatest sci fi novels of our time, so to call it second rate sci fi is just plain stupid. As for the film, this movie did something that I hoped it would, it took a portion of the book and adopted it into a fantastic, artistic film, full of psychological twists, great acting and spectacular cinematography. To recreate the book to the t is simply impossible. The genious of this book is that for the large part it happens in the mind. So no two people will see this story in the same way. It is also wrong to say that Soderberg was trying to compete with 2001 some how. Just because this is a psychological movie that happens in space does not make it a rip-off of 2001. This movie was about half the book, and i understand why. If the whole book was to be made into the movie, the film would be way too long to show in a theater. Overall, this movie was done very well, I love the book and I love the movie. To those of you who haven't seen this movie I advise the following: if you're looking to see another installment of 2001, don't go, if you're looking to see a Trek type film, don't go, if you're looking to see a picture that is nothing like you've ever seen before and which will seem different every time you watch it, while being very uncommericial, mesmorising and brilliantly made, GO SEE IT !!! 10 stars.",

The book was NOT about \"a second chance to correct a mistake\" but about Man's inability to understand himself or the universe.Even though it's 90 minutes shorter than Tarkovsky's snail paced treatise, it feels even longer.

Byline: Astronaut visits space station and soon his dead wife, friends and fellow astronauts show up one after another. Makes us wonder if an alien intelligence has read said astronaut's mind and is tricking him into returning said station to Earth for its own inscrutable purposes.For 1985-92 Outer Limits fans, this is familiar territory. Humans in outer space typically see lost loved ones and/or have their minds taken over by aliens, who, having no \"lives\" of their own, just hover in space, waiting for human victims to come by to be victimized. Not that The Outer Limits doesn't have some good stories, but rather that the writers pepper their young audiences with aliens getting inside their skins or inside their minds, to the point where we've come to expect these once-novel, now-tired sci-fi clich\u00e9s.Fans of \"clairvoyant\" John Edward, who \"connects\" fans to their deceased relatives, may also find this kind of thing rewarding, as it perpetuates the dead-coming-back-to-visit-the-living idea. I wouldn't call this sort of film \"science fiction,\" as there is no science and it promotes the idea that when humans go into space they see not what the universe gives them but what they want to see - lost loved ones and fanciful and tantalizing vistas that have nothing to do with the mind-boggling universe that actually exists. I thought Robin Williams' \"What Dreams May Come\" explored this territory much better and more imaginatively, even if it was meant to represent the after-life and is not \"sci-fi.\"",

The acting is top notch and the chemistry between Cloony and McElhorne(who easily provides one of her best preformances to date) is electrifying. Some people may feel this film is slow-paced and the director (Soderbergh) doesn't really get his message across. But i feel the silences (used alot in Solaris) tell a thousand words specially when describing the complex relationship that exists between the characters played by Cloony & McElhorne, and at the end of the day the film lets u come up with the answers as to what Solaris truely represents. One of the many questions the film asks is whether one man would give up life as he knows it for true bliss and happiness with his loving wife(even though it may not necessary be his wife) and even made me wonder whether in the same position if i would carry out the same decisions he eventually makes given the choice?

It is wonderful goal for a film to have, but it was a noble plan that failed horribly.Dr. Kelvin is a therapist sent to a space station that is orbiting the planet Solaris. He is supposed to find out why the remaining crew won't come home. Or is he there to figure out why most of the crew was murdered? Or did they commit suicide? Actually, I'm not sure why he is sent there. Solaris creates facsimiles of the crew's dearly departed, mainly Kelvin's late wife, from their memories. I am not sure why the planet Solaris is doing it and neither does the crew. I'm not sure why many things are happening in this movie. The plot isn't too convoluted to be followed. There just isn't any plot at all.The best part of this movie was seeing George Clooney naked-not once, but twice. My favorite nude shot was of Kelvin and his wife sharing a bowl of Ramen noodles in all their post-coital glory. (Clooney is proof that people can look better as they get older!) Clooney also does a great job of doing that charming, soulful, caring, subtly sexy thing he does so well. He perfected it in the other Steven Soderbergh movie he starred in-the wonderfully subtle and sexy Out of Sight. In fact, the flashbacks in Solaris are very reminiscent of the hotel and love scenes between Clooney and Jennifer Lopez in Out of Sight. There's a feeling of invading on someone's intimate moment and memory. With all that, the movie was a colossal waste of time. Wait for it to come on television. Better yet, just rent Out of Sight.",

            "content": "I was expecting great things after reading a review of this.  It started off well enough, with a lot of slow or static shots rarely focussed on the person talking, making you think about the consequences of what was being said for the person in shot - mmm, arty, I thought!  After that, this artiness got a little tiresome, with continued use of very slow pans and lingering shots of nothing happening.It wasn't long before I realised Solaris was a would-be \"2001: A Space Odyssey\": the lingering shots, nothing much happening, even the style of music.  I was never a fan of 2001 because of that slowness (yet how did Alien manage to go slow but keep the audience engaged?), so Solaris trying to mimic that wasn't endearing.  I sat and tried to work out what kind of a movie it was.  Exciting?  No way.  Tense?  Nope.  Thrilling?  Funny? Humourous?  No.  Emotional?  Surprisingly, no.  Interesting?  No, sorry, not at all.Having watched plenty of other films (and TV series like Star Trek!) make the same kind of story much more engaging, I found I really didn't care what happened.  They even tried a couple of twists, but these just came off as \"let's-add-a-twist.\"I suppose the acting was okay given the limited material, but in the end the movie just seemed rather pointless, contrived, dull (which I may have mentioned already), and unbelievable.  There was the promise of much, with exciting possibilities set up, but the promise wasn't delivered, unfortunately.(As a slight aside, it never looks good when people are sitting in the cinema with their eyes closed, and worse still when people walk out 15 minutes from the end; both of these happened when I saw Solaris.)",

            "content": "Why bring up this argument, you may ask?I was scamming through imdb.com and a quote, that is in my subject field (by Steven Soderbergh, director), is presented in the trivia for Solaris (2002)..I had an ENORMOUS problem with the remake, that refers to the said comment.\nHere is goes:\nI like Steven Soderbergh's films. I find his work lively and fresh, and also respect that he can adjust his aesthetics/style toward the films he makes. Most of his films vary wildly in content as well; also from commercial to artistic-like. Most of the films in his lap (Sex, Lies, and Videotape (1989), Schizopolis (1996), Limey, The (1999), Erin Brockovich (2000), Traffic (2000), Ocean's Eleven (2001)) have one numerous awards and accolades and are even considered modern masterpieces in certain circles.Considered the most famous Soviet filmmaker since Sergei M. Eisenstein, Andrei Tarkovsky (on the other hand), was proven as one of the most idiosyncratic director's even now, after his tragic death. Despite his films being considered a part of world cinema's history (and being a big influence to some directors, note: Soderbergh), they fail to reach critic and commercial success. This is largely due to the same idiosyncrasies mention previously, they include affecting-yet-deliberate (Most Northern Americans read: slow) storytelling, blatant religious references (even as far as making them a part of the story and sometimes the story itself: The Mirror (1975), a biography of Tarkovsky) and ideas, Classical scoring and use of Classical Paintings within the films themselves, and last but not least: strong character development/psychology with references to each scene.Solyaris (1972) had every bit of Tarkovsky's vision of film making down to a science (easy argument; all of his films are highly respect, if not appreciated), no pun. Due to his highly eclectic form of storytelling and aesthetics; the atmosphere within the film is so dense and rich it begs for repeated viewings on that alone. Space is dirty. It is not a safe place to be, and not everyone is beautiful that goes there. Also, there is much more than a love story that is brewing in this film and it allows you to follow that major plot's course to the fullest (with 165 minutes running time). This is where I believe that Solaris (2002) suffers most (a meager 99 minutes running time).Solaris (2002) attempts to find middle ground with mainstream culture by eliminating subtleties and pushing the story into a faster momentum. Director James Cameron (of Titanic (1997) fame) was set to direct, but was said to have opted for a Producer credit instead, because he felt he couldn't portray the story completely. It's possible that even after James Cameron sidestepped, it still hurt the film, but I doubt it.\nThis was Soderbergh's first attempt at melding art film with mainstream; it is evident even during Pre-Production (I began following the film, when he received the green light). It rode on a form of endeavor, but ultimately failed for it's lack of follow-through and inspiration. We needed more conflict and more underpinned suggestions for it to ride, but he wanted the mainstream to watch it. This is all shown through the perspective fades from George Clooney's character and Solaris itself, it's bland and adds very little or sometimes nothing to either the story or his psychology. Sadly it even becomes annoying. Solyaris (1972) includes similar transitions, but they play very differently.All of this to say that Solaris (2002) is a movie I shouldn't watch? Not exactly.It is a movie that disrespected the original film. And, after watching it I got to thinking that this movie was going to make everyone that watched it, not care to even check up on a great film that is: Solyaris (1972)Oh yea, and I believe that the quote mentioned above was cut-off, it should read: If the audience does not enjoy the first 10 minutes of the film, then they might as well leave and go watch the better version.",

Of course I am biased; the reason why I watched this film was to see how it compared to the Tarkovsky film and to be honest I never thought Soderburg and Clooney were up to the job, the best I was hoping for was a film which didn't try to be too clever and instead came up with a few neat innovations for science fiction. Instead the film turned out to be simply the most tedious dialogue I have ever experienced set against endlessly plain futuristic style backdrops broken only by a tacky sex scene featuring an unwelcome view of Clooney's buttocks. Nothing in this film is profound, nothing in this film is entertaining and I can't think of a single reason to recommend anyone this film unless you happen to fancy the leading actors rear end.",

            "content": "`Solaris' could have been much better had it stayed closer to the intent of Stanislaw Lem's original novel. In Lem's novel, Solaris is a planet totally covered by a gelatinous sea that may or may not exhibit sentience. Humanity puts a station into orbit around the planet to study this colloidal ocean, this strange blob that may or may not be an alien life form. Strange things begin to happen. Geometric shapes appear and disappear in space for no discernable reason, followed by purposeless contraptions, and finally by physical manifestations of people from the scientist's own pasts. The reasons for all this are never determined, and never CAN be determined. Solaris, then, represents the human subconscious, which is not amenable to logic, analysis, or definitive `explanations.' The subconscious generates impulses, dreams, and creative variations for no `purpose' other than to express. To approach the subconscious with mere logic is like asking why circles are round: they just are. Yet man (Western man especially) will not hear of this, for he fancies himself a rational being. He likes to think that his logic dominates his instincts, a delusion that distorts his reason and causes him untold suffering. He insists that he can use the surface of his mind to delve into its own depths, which is like trying to understand a computer program while being controlled by the program itself. Result: one goes in circles that are fraught with obsession, tyranny, and hypocrisy. The surface of the mind can only deal in dualities, in definite things, in hard edges and sharp corners, in actuality. By contrast, the subconscious is the realm of formless, vague, and dynamic potential. It is as amorphous as the strange ocean that covers the planet Solaris.   Such was the intent of Len's novel. The film itself comes closest to this point when a character remarks that, `We don't want other worlds, we just want mirrors.' This concept is pursued further in the film when Chris Kelvin, a psychologist who is sent to the station (George Clooney) grapples with how he related to his dead wife, who suddenly appears to him out of nowhere. Kelvin gradually realizes that he had mostly been in love with a mirror of himself. It dawns on him that he was married not to a person but to his projection, just as the physical manifestation of his wife on the space station is a `projection' from the planet Solaris.  Kelvin's failure to understand this about himself while his wife was still alive on earth is made all the more poignant by the fact that he is a psychologist -- someone who supposedly appreciates the vagaries of mind. Indeed, it is his very talent at seeing into the human mind that thwarts his wife's attempts to communicate with him as a conscious being with her own profound feelings. After all, as a psychologist, it's Kelvin's `job' to dissect, analyze, and `figure out,' not to submit to another in the interests of intimacy, even though Kelvin craves intimacy as much as any other human.\nMeanwhile, regarding art direction, technical details are de-emphasized, which supports the story's message that human technology can never lead to an understanding of a truly alien thing. This is a refreshing change from tedious attempts by special effects people to show off their computer skills. The space suits, however, are unforgivably hokey. They look like silver overalls worn by oil derrick workers, not something that provides raw life support in the most hostile environment there is: space.    Among the film's more fundamental problems is its apparent attempt to satisfy today's demand that a storyline must revolve around a `love interest.'  With just a few more minutes of running time, a few more lines of dialogue, and a few more hints at the overall meaning of the planet Solaris, the movie would have retained what it has, including the `love interest,' while also including themes that are more clearly universal and profound. The film's biggest flaw, however, is wrapped in its primary strength, which is its over-reliance on mood and ambience. At first glance this may seem a refreshing change. Today, Hollywood rarely budges from hackneyed storytelling formulae because moviegoers turn up their noses when presented with anything too fresh and original, anything that is too much of what they ask for. Nonetheless, a director must balance mood with plot. He must counter-foil ambience with action. He should start with a forceful story, pithy dialogue, and purposeful action, and intersperse these with scenes that have no plot, dialogue, or action at all--just photography accompanied by memorable music that fleshes out the story's `feel' and `spirit.' `Solaris,' however, is nothing BUT `feeling' and `spirit,' a pastiche of glances, gestures, and snapshot scenes that occasionally approach brilliance, but, taken as a whole, demand more than they return. Thus, `Solaris' loses its balance. This is why some people walk out of the theatre before the film ends. They appreciate that there may just be a profound message somewhere in it but, weary of its nebulousness, they resign themselves to asking friends what THAT was all about. Most of their friends will shrug their shoulders, and even when one of those friends offers a useful interpretation, the moviegoer thinks, `Oh. I see. Whatever.'\n`Solaris' will flop commercially, but time will be kind to it. It is like a small coral atoll that breaks out on the surface of an ocean.  At first, people scorn the atoll, step on it, and dump trash on it. Then, as the water around it sinks-i.e., as today's awful movies continue to become even more awful-the atoll becomes an island, and finally a mountain that towers over the sinking sea. This does not mean that `Solaris' will one day become a `cult classic,' or any kind of `classic' based on its intrinsic qualities. It means that the film will eventually be somewhat more appreciated in the context of its time. Viewed from this angle, I salute the director for at least trying to do something different in a way that's constructive, rather than adolescent, vulgar, or gratuitous.",

For instance, one can appreciate the musical prowress of a \"jam\" band, but be bored by the jam. \nSteven Soderbergh has taken on the role of jam band.  Solaris is a jam session of a movie.  It is full of variations on a theme, and false starts that don't develop and riffs that are repeated.  The film is deliberately paced, it is not slow.  And just like a jam session, when you least expect it Solaris comes back to the important riffs.The funny thing is -- that is the best description I can give of Solaris without spoiling it.  It does have very little \"plot\".  It is not a densely written thriller (I don't mean dense as in stupid, I mean dense as in LA Confidential -- a bunch going on).  It is well acted and well directed and well photographed.  An interesting link between 2002 Solaris and 1972 Solaris is that by the end of the 2002 film, George Clooney seemed to look more and more like the original lead actor, it was uncanny.If you liked 2001: A Space Odyssey, A.I.:Artificial Intelligence, and Contact (and even Magnolia) I think you'll like Solaris.

The plot line stays simple throughout and the film uses it visuals to keep the story where its going. Its basically a love story in outer space - but its really nowhere near that cheesy! Although some might say it's nothing special I really think it takes a lot of input and effort to achieve a film of this calibre. For instance the quality of acting is heavily relied on unlike some Hollywood blockbusters these days that count on huge special effects and CGI to get the audience in. The soundtrack NEEDS to be spot on, that mellow psychedelic ambiance is perfect here. The visual effects must stay with reality, not too much CGI, which spoils so many films of late, stick to the basics of actual set design and real props instead of computer generated ones, it does this so well.

This is overly simplistic and displays a lack of understanding (midway through the film, when the main character wondered the reason behind the \"alien\" causing these people to appear on the ship, it was pointed out to him that his mistake was to assume that the alien needed a reason to do what it was doing). The \"alien\" is merely incidental to the basic plot of the film which is, in fact, centred around a man's struggle to come to terms with a personal trauma in his life and the desire to turn back the clock and have things turn out differently.I thought this Solaris remake was an outstanding film - even better than the 1972 original. My beef with the 1972 version was that there was no depth or explanation behind the particular apparitions appearing on the ship - who was the boy? Why did the main character behave in such a way towards his \"visitor\" and what was behind his \"visitor\"'s behaviour? The updated version of the film answers those questions by giving an insight into the background of the main character and his \"visitor\", and the film is all the richer for it. Some people might claim this background information makes the film slow-moving; for me, it's essential to the enjoyment of the movie.Don't let the appearance of George Clooney put you off either. OK, he overacts at times but otherwise this is his finest acting performance. The direction and the musical score are superb, all adding to the atmosphere.If you want fast-moving action, comedy or a \"feel good\" experience, go elsewhere - if you want to watch a stimulating and thought-provoking film, based on a struggle and desire that many of us feel but rarely discuss, watch Solaris.",

Welcome to the latter.  Its' origin derives from the brilliant science fiction novel of Stanislaw Lem.  The almost three hour Russian version is an incredible film in its own right.  Steven Soderbergh has also crafted an excellent film from this material.

Kudos to Soderbergh for being willing to hack away at the material to make it more filmic.And in truth, the film is not that weird or hard to understand if you've ever done a psychedelic drug. The symbolism is obvious: George Clooney takes a trip and starts hallucinating, just like everyone else who's been within reach of the mysterious Solaris. (It's a nebulous cloud in space that shows signs of intelligence.) Soderbergh (as well as Tarkovsky) gives us a compelling visualization of a mental state, and he appears to accomplish everything he sets out to accomplish. Is there much more you can ask from a film?",

Solaris is a great movie...Clooney's performance is outstanding, much better than batman and Natasha Mcelhone is just beautiful. There isn't much conventional exploding, hair-raising action in this film, which sets it out from the usual sci-fi that's out there. The closest correlation i can make is with 2001 a space odyssey...without the extreme confusion as to what the point of it all was. Watch this one with your girlfriend and she'll bawl into your arms for hours...an extremely deep poignant story and though a remake...definitely original in every other sense.",

Possibly it was my mood at the time but I found the tone, the lack of background music and the pace to be very soothing.  In fact, if I had to name my favorite aspect of this movie it would have to be the lack of a sweeping soundtrack or background wash throughout the movie. And I would not agree that the story jumps around too much or is non-sensical.  I thought the flashes from the main characters memories made sense, anyway it worked for me.I thought the character development, acting and writing were all average to above average.  The set work and visuals were very good and as I mentioned above, the tone and pace of the movie really worked for me.  I also liked the story and the fact that I could interpret it myself and that the writer and director did not cram the correct interpretation down my throat.\nThis movie has no real action at all, no explosions and does not portray a classic 'hero' vs 'bad guy' plot so many will not enjoy it.

            "content": "We will wake up one day to discover that Steven Soderbergh is a great director. He is a true auteur working in an industry of philistines. A quick scan of his filmography reveals an artist not content with the ordinary repetition of craft, but one who dares to explore the edge from time to time. Like Kubrick before him, he does it all. He writes, directs, photographs, and edits. \"Solaris\" is essentially a one-man show. I don't think it is any accident that his best films are those single explorations of theme. \"Solaris,\" \"The Limey,\" \"Out of Sight,\" \"The Underneath,\" \"King of the Hill,\" and, of course \"Sex, Lies, and Videotape,\" are amazing in their delicacy, or brash in audacity. \"Traffic\" is, in this critic's opinion, the only true, large breakout film for him. \"Ocean's Eleven\" was unwatchable. \"Erin Brockovich\" the most overrated film in 2000. Soderbergh's heart is large but his filmmaking sentiments are more intimate.Now, \"Solaris.\" I have seen the Tarkovsky version but I have not read the book. The '72 Solaris was long (almost three hours), very talky, and very Russian. Tarkovsky's visuals were in line with the cinematic experimental vogue of the time. Neither groundbreaking nor revolutionary in general terms, Tarkovsky's Solaris was his attempt to capitalize on and experiment with a medium that was finding powerful legs in the brave new world of anything-goes cinema. \"2001\" opened many doors, and Kubrick's \"Clockwork Orange\" was to come next year.Soderbergh's \"Solaris is neither dyspeptic nor vacuous. It's colors are rich and saturated--which I find a curious style choice given its metaphor--its music evocative, and its actors engagingly human. Perhaps one could have wished for a film more antiseptic, more Spartan, more \"Kubrickian,\" but that would go against the grain of the director's intent. If Kubrick was the director of opposites, so is Soderbergh, giving you a SF film without science, a psychological film without the psychology, whose inherent truths lie deep in the penetrating eyes of its stars--those of the actors and the star-like planet their ship revolves around. And what of Solaris? It's not so much a planet than a mass of neurons and electrical impulses that sparks and flares in resplendent glory not unlike our own brain. Tarkovsky's Solaris was made of water. Here, we are treated to phantasmagoria as psychic malevolence.Clooney and McElhone give understated but excellent, brave, performances. In their eyes we see their love, angst, confusion, despair. This is Clooney's 3rd film with Soderberg and one can see why. Clooney is becoming the great actor of age, honing his craft in small but important films. His role in \"O Brother Where Art Thou\" is nothing short of genius. As Clooney begins to embody the elemental force of the \"everyman,\" to use Clooney is to suggest, through cinematic shorthand, as vast range of emotions in a short amount of time. His time has come.Soderbergh may never make the multi-billion dollar success. In fact, I hope he doesn't. I would rather him make more pictures like \"Solaris\" and less like \"Ocean's Eleven.\" Small, in this case, is definitely better.",

It's not about extremes of anger or violence, but about the ways people live and cope with tragic and even blameworthy events day-to-day. Lem, like a sci-fi Camus, has found surprising qualities in the life right under our nose, and, in seeing them, we find something more real and telling than any description of people in more overtly painful, but much less likely circumstance.Some critics have complained about the \"artsy\" Kubrickian style of direction, but they are, in my opinion, only noticing the similarity of the sets to those of 2001, and the quietness of the soundtrack.  Soderberg uses the camera as a recorder of events as they happen, physically present with the actors as some non-character point-of-view, and he lets his microphones record, essentially, the \"found\" sound of life in the space-station. Soderberg's style then is clearly descended, not from Stanley Kubrick, but Robert Altman, and such a direct style is anything but artsy.All in all, I give this film a 9.

I just can't comprehend why anyone would remake this material in this fashion.Don't get me wrong, Solaris is beautifully filmed; Soderbergh has obviously seen 2001 a few times.  It's just that the illogical turns, and unexplored possibilities, submarine the whole thing.For example, why does Clooney's friend invite him to Solaris, saying he's the \"perfect\" person to be there?  The illogic of this has to be intentional, but why?  Upon arrival, Clooney turns from a top-notch psychiatrist into an irrational fool.  No interest into getting to the bottom of what's going on, just indulgence of his own subconscious. And of course, no contact with Earth to keep him rooted in his mission.

Being a huge Kubrick fan, I went to see this film hoping that it would pay homage to the late master director. Alas, I left the theater feeling disappointed and even angry. The directing was decent, the acting was at times very good, and even most of the dialogue was fairly intelligent, but the story, the true substance of the movie, was trite, muddled, and downright poor. At least Kubrick had a point to his great piece. Soderbergh, on the other hand, is attempting to be deep without having anything really to say. The premise reminded me of a guilty pleasure of mine, Event Horizon, though in Solaris, there is absolutely no follow through. I have never felt so detached from the characters in a movie in my life. Jeremy Davies provoked an occasional smirk, but other than that, I felt absolutely nothing throughout the entirety of the movie, until feeling very very upset as I exited the theater. Davies' mildly humorous performance upgraded this picture from a $10 root canal to a botched filling. Take my advice: for true sci-fi mastery, see 2001. For a fun and creepy b sci-fi flick, check out Event Horizon. Steve, you simply should not attempt what has already been done. Just because you left the fetus out of the sphere at the conclusion of the film, it doesn't mean I, as well as many others I'm sure, didn't see what you were doing, and as a Kubrick defender, I am insulted by your \"movie\".

There are quite a few spots where it strikes the chords of old sci-fi themes a little harder than its predecessor does, but I believe that's a good thing. At the very least, it's great to have both treatments. The things suggested in this movie are not cloaked, over-much, in Mystery and they aren't lingered over. The look on Cloonie's face when he speaks those lines, though: \"I woke up and you were here.\" It's like he understands that he's in over his head, but doesn't want to get away, really. Who, faced with the return of a lost Beloved (especially given the details of Chris' \"loss\" of Rheya), could stand flushing her into the Vacuum over and over again?Chris is clever and knows a bit about the psyche, but in his way, he's about as irritating and banal as the gum-popping Snow.

And there are movies like Solaris as compared to Eight Crazy Nights, the Sum of All Fears, and Sweet Home Alabama.

You think these people that walk out on this movie could sit through 1000 pages of Tom Jones, one of the best satires on aristocracy ever written?  Probably not.  Too bad American culture is being dumbed down.  American art and entertainment I feel aims for a more straightforward approach, resulting in a melodrama paradigm, granted that there are attempts to obtain a more esoteric approach to film as demonstrated by the overrated Minority Report (still a good film, just overrated), however Solaris just completely supercedes this and others.  A brave attempt on Soderbergh's part to develop a more \"European\" film technique.  I've seen the original Tarkovsky version and didn't like it as much as this remake, and this coming from someone who absolutely loves Andrei Rublyov and Stalker (go figure).

They have to study the classics, they have to read shakespeare, they have to listen to composers much more difficult to appreciate than Dave Matthews.  The same reason why many US audiences will find this movie completely boring.",

In the book he has quite a lot meetings with his dead wife, a lot of time passes by before he puts her into the rocket and gets rid of her. In the movie it is like \"Scene A: meet girl\", \"Scene B: get rid of girl\". That hurts, hurts very much if you know the book.Another aspect is the change of the characters. Some who are old get very young. Male change into female, etc. It all puzzled me too much.Furthermore I missed the lack of the planet expeditions. I really wanted to know how Soderburg though of them and with the today technical abilities it could have been very spectacular.SPOOOOOOOOOOOOOILER !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Well, sadly I never had the possibility to watch the old Russian version.

Music was quite decent and so was cinematography. The movie deserves a couple of Oscars (2002 is a watery vintage...) but there is something unsettling about it. To put it simply: this is not the real Solaris. In fact, it is, once again, a distortion. Stanislaw Lem hated the first Solaris and left Moscow almost in tears. His novel ends on the Planet (Kelvin standing by the Thinking Ocean) with cathartic big bang: \"I knew that the reign of scary miracles was over...\"\nTarkovsky's overdrawn and self-important film ends on Earth: Kelvin kneeling in front of his father begging for forgiveness, forming a two-bodied incestual Uroboros. Lem complained that his optimistic message was negated and muddled. He was right. Solaris-the-novel is optimistic in that there is a triumph of reason over the \"dark depths of the subconscious\" and there is a feeling that scary miracles (a thinly veiled reference to the unshakable grip of the Idea of Supreme Being on the throat of human civilization) must be left in the past if we were to grow. Alas, the new Solaris, well-made and compelling it might be, is still a deeply theistic film. No need for spoilers (c'mon, go read the book!) but the final sequence has been seen a good dozen times before: from Michelangelo to the Simpsons. I am not going to criticize Soderbergh for not being able to answer the ripe question: what is there AFTER religion -- he is not the new Plato. And he certainly has the right to believe in Higher Powers. Still... Here's Lem putting in front of us both Creation and Resurrection as mere artifacts of supressed subconscious -- and here are Tarkovsky and Soderbergh turning it into an affirmation of forgiveness that we might gain from some source (Planet Earth or Planet Solaris -- does it really matter?)\nHas the time of scary miracles turned into the time of viscous thinking?\u0085If you are a latent believer: 10/10.

They're not new: What is the difference between being alive and being dead? Just how wide is the chasm between \"reality\" and our perception thereof? Did god create us, did we create god, or does it even matter at all? Who are we to define what it means to be \"human?\" I \"get it.\" I just don't care, because we have no reason to. We don't care about Kelvin, we don't care about his wife, we don't care about this spaceship, or this planet.This movie was the retro-beatnik that sits in the local independent coffee shop and recites off-kilter poetry because he likes to hear his own unorthodoxy.\"Solaris\" is a big fluff of cotton candy which, if it weren't laced with layers of \"look what I can do\" cleverness, would have been enough to satisfy me. Unfortunately, Soderbergh mistook \"vague, disorienting and disconnected\" for \"deep\"...and in the process, wasted an hour and a half of my life. \"Battlefield Earth,\" for example, was a cookie-cutter, amateur recruitment video-slash-miniseries pretending to be a movie...but I was even able to find SOMETHING redeeming about it. \"Solaris\" is by no means the worst movie I've ever seen. It's just the most worthless and empty experience I've had the misfortune of paying for to date. And I've seen some really vapid films in my time (\"2001\" comes to mind)Consider this your warning.

In regards to the movie, there are some differences from the book, but I still count it as my favorite.

This movie pays homage to both filmmakers in a variety of ways (anyone who has seen 2001 and E.T., will have no problems picking out the most salient ones) to let everyone in the audience know that Soderberg knows perfectly well he's trying to create some sort of classic like 2001 or Close Encounters and not just \"ripping\" off Spielberg or Kubrick.  Unforunately the movie DOES come off as a fourth rate 2001: A Space Odyssey.  The ending, like the entire movie really, mixes the worst of both Kubrick and Spielberg by being vague and open ended on one side and sentimental and predictable on the other.  The combination...is well just plain awful.And one last thing.

            "content": "--Spoilers below--The popular theme of `I am God' is taken to extremes in Solaris. The movie depicts a world built upon a nihilistic point-of-view. In the absence of objective truth, humans are left with only their subjective perceptions and the entire life experience becomes an object of humanistic creation. Therefore, human existence lies within boundaries of the greatest aspirations and the basest desires, yet; the existence is constrained by the finite capacity of the human mind. The philosophy can be summarized as, `We cannot create anything greater than ourselves.'The corporeal visitors in Solaris come from the memories of a human host. Solaris seems to analyze dreams during sleep then creates the visitors based on those dreams and memories. The central character, Dr. Kelvin, experiences the Solaris effect via the visitation of his `resurrected' wife. She has been dead for years but Solaris creates her exactly as he remembers her-and therein lays the rub. As an extension of his memory she is more automaton than human. The familiarity of her physical appearance and social responses are comforting and intoxicating. Yet the overall experience lacks the lightness of spontaneity and serendipity. Dr. Kelvin becomes trapped in a `heaven' of his own creation.There are many other themes depicted in the movie related too this central theme. If you enjoy movies that require the audience to feel and think about what they feel--then see this movie.Best Regards, Darth87 December 2002",

Despite that, the film raises some interesting questions about what would happen if our memories became embodied and developed their own consciousness...do they have a separate existence outside of our mind? Can they grow or develop beyond the confines of our perception of the past? The film could have been much more and although people here say it was boring, I was dying for another 1/2 hour to go more deeply into some issues...things were wrapped up too quickly and neatly for my tastes. Guess I'll be hunting for the original Russian film next!Parting words: Go see the film and make up your own mind.

The plot unfolds at a leisurely pace, the atmospherics are brilliant, the lighting (which surely deserves an award) keeps one peering at the screen. The plot elements are not particularly compelling - the philosophical elements are. However, the script examines the latter in not enough detail. The themes of death, mortality and memory intertwine themselves, but never really manage to work their way into the script. This results in a film that is visually stunning but one that fears to tread further into the philosophical debate it commences. Perhaps Sodebergh felt his script was too highbrow and didn't want to alienate the broader swathe of viewers he thought he may otherwise attract. The result is a film which is neither traditional science fiction nor High Art. Nevertheless, it remains one of the more intelligent films I've seen emerge from Hollywood for some time.",

He is compelled to visit a space station following a mysterious plea from a friend.

This story is set in a science fiction surrounding, but is very much a story about relationships. In one scene Chris tells Rheya that he is the right guy for her, but we soon discover that he fails her. Ultimately Chris wants to redeem himself by saving her when offered a second chance. The movie is very slow paced, allowing for great character development. Solaris is refreshing in that it leaves many questions unanswered.

It faithfully recreates the cold, lonely, brooding atmosphere of the remote space station, rendered in cold colours, bare metal and harsh, industrial background noise. The characters are well played with what little dialogue there is. The soundtrack is subtle and complements the feel of the film. The alien planet is beautifully rendered, in fact it's visually the most colourful and complex thing in the whole film, with pulsating colours and strange, wispy cloud formations.The reason 'Solaris' probably invokes such strong reactions is that it doesn't insult the intelligence with explanations, but leaves the viewer to fill in the gaps, of which there are plenty.My main criticism of it (as a 'mainstream art-house' film) is that it is possibly a little too slick. Everything about it is visually perfect, from the planet itself to the gratuitous, crowd-pleasing Clooney butt sequence. I would prefer to have seen a little 'Alien' style grubbiness, given the dysfunction of all the film's characters. This is scant criticism for such an ambitious project and I think Soderbergh has struck a happy medium between philosophical musing and a good old-fashioned love storyI also found that the sparseness of the film doesn't leave much to be savoured on subsequent viewings.Open your mind. 6/10",

His directing could have been greater but the work still lands in the charts of good film-making and adaptations from a classical novel to screen. What is most intriguing about this particular celluloid version of the book is that there is no character development. There is no sense of particularity in the characters. You can actually even doubt the very existence of life. And what about the wife of George Clooney's character? Does she exist or not? Who is on board on this space vessel? The answer is a self-exploration of a psychotherapist for the main character, the one that George Clooney with the direction of Soderbergh accomplishes successfully. Magnificent acting, not over the top but just right. But the answer still is a contradiction. The final message of the film itself is a contradiction and there is no definite end of the story, or a beginning in the same sense.During the film you kind of accumulate the feeling of knowing the different characters but in the end doubt their even existence. This is symbol of mankind's development, evolution, meaning of life if you may - self-perspective, self knowledge and understanding.It's deep, it's chilling, it's bizarre and makes no sense at some point, because it is dreamlike. The whole film sequences seem like taken bits from a dream. don't get me wrong, it's a well-organized, well-directed, acted out to perfection and with a great score but in the end it stays up in the air. You have to feel it to understand it. Sense it to comprehend it. Let go any logic whatsoever and just ask yourself - what do you fear and desire most?And up to the point of conclusion - Love? Noun, no explanation. It cannot be enforced and it's existence is a mystery. That's what the novel is about. If you know what \"love\" is, you shouldn't watch this movie. But come on, who really knows what \"love\" really is?",

Like motivation for Kelvin's actions.  Whether it is the screenplay's fault, or if Kelvin's motivations are edited out, his whole demeanor is not convincing from the limited backstory we are given to begin with.  Add to that the sloppiness of subplots left hanging (mentioned quite well in other comments) and you are left with something that *could* have been great, or even good but which just feels empty.  Clooney's work is very good for what he has to work with, and Jeremy Davies is quite together for the not-all-together Snow.  But again, with a flawed production there is only so much they can do.3 out of 10.",

But I could tell after about 28 seconds that this one just wasn't a winner.  I felt something was missing. It was like suddenly I was just sitting on a perch attached to the ceiling of a house inhabited by some certifiably crazy deaf mutes.  There was no explanations, very little talking, hardly any music to back the movie up ... and I was like what the hey.  I could tell the other people in the theater felt the same way.  At one point mid movie an old man got up and left and didn't come back. These were my feelings for about the first half-hour.  After that you start to get an idea of what's going on, but it still isn't doing anything for you.  First there's a lot of silence, you're just watching people who are doing little more than breathing.  Then the flash back come, and boy, are these fun.  A lot of flowery music, a lot of pretty smiling faces, no rhyme or reason ... After about 45 minutes you realize why you've got this void in your stomache like something is just MISSING and you don't know what it is ... there is absolutely no excitement in this flick.  Even after you start to get the gyst of things, you're still waiting for the bomb to drop. It never does.  And the scenery reminds me of some sort of 60's space show -- just a little bit to white and silvery, a lot of wanna be high tech that serves little purpose. I don't want to ruin the end for you but when it finally comes, you're going to be both disappointed -- like, that's it? -- and relieved that the stupid thing is just over.  It's like a bad episode of Star Trek. I recommend this movie for those of you who like a little poetic license, because more than once (while fighting the urge to just take a nap) a thought to myself that this was like a bad poem put on screen.  I think if you liked What Dreams May Come then you'll probably like this one too. But it just in no way fills your desire for some thought provoking \"whats going on in space today?\" feelings.  I hate to do this, because I do love you George, but this one just doesn't cut it.  The highlight of the entire thing is getting to see Clooney's very nice behind.  Then just leave, and don't look back.  Trust me, you're really not missing anything.",

The slow, moody pace talks to them who likes to make journeys in the mind and not deep down some robot infested spacehulk.So what are the keepings of this film? Well... First of all the music was awesome. It gave the film the perfect framing and together with the \"outdoor\" scenes it created one of the most stunning sci-fi experiences you will ever get. Guaranteed.The science/technique (as in sci-fi) in this film is secondary, which is rare in sci-fi today, the film is almost completely held up by the explorations of human psychology.The cast really perform a very fine job with this one here. I have always avoided everything with \"Clooney\" on the front but this has made me reconsider although he is still far down on my list. Snow and Helen are perfectly casted. Where have they dug up these two anyways?I wish i would have seen this at a movie theater. The good thing was that i could rewind and see the scene where the shuttle arrives at the space station as many times that i wanted. Awesome feeling!

But even though I did not feel heaven, I did find myself provoked to ask many questions, listen to many answers, and ponder them both.  Surprisingly this movie is gripping, especially with all the warnings people have put out to the impatient about being bored.  In comparison to many of the action packed crap put out today that is utterly more boring with their fiber thin plots and ambiguous reasons for creation this movie rises above the rest although it admittedly has a more methodical pace than most films, and I liked that.  It gave me time to appreciate the film before the credits rolled.The acting was superb, just superb around everything else.  A key line for me was paraphrased here, \"There are no answers, just choices.\"  I was impressed and bought into Jeremy Davies character of Snow too, which may sound puzzling to many of you as it seems the majority feels he was an annoyance but I liked him.  Oh yeah, and Clooney and Mchelone were excellent as well, but I think there performances speak for themselves.Another thing that is almost necessary for a film to become one of my favorites is atmosphere, and this movie has it like a five star restaurant. There is just this feeling that is in the air, like it has jumped off screen and into the theater.  The ideas that are contained in this film, interpreted in any opinion, are truly refreshing and purely amazing from any point of view.  I would have to say as a gauge, if you liked AI there are a lot of similarities that would increase your chances of enjoying this movie as well.Not everyone feels this way, but the religious overtones standout in the film for me.  Whether it was intentional or not, or whether I added most of the overtones myself the planet Solaris itself carries more than just scientific weight.  And still more, there is a thoroughly convincing and deep character study about human relationships and the need for communication.  I especially enjoyed the scene where Clooney has a flashback of his wife and himself walking down the street, there was just something hauntingly emotional about it.  Steven Soderbergh should be commended, AGAIN!! for his continued drive to express something and his ability to make us think.  His vision and talent to the art form of film is something to be cherished.  I also found Cliff Martinez's score to capture each scene exquisitely and his music to be emotionally resounding.  Look for his next great score in Narc and his last great one in Traffic.And does anyone have a clue about the doorknob on the train?",

Problem: it is both those things, but at the same time -- you know, like a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup. No wonder no one saw it, and the few who did were bitterly disappointed. What Solaris is, is a brilliant and moody art film that uses sci-fi and romance clich\u00e9s (A, something bad is happening in a far off space station; B, I miss my dead wife so much my life is empty without her) to weave a profound and fascinating parable of how people create the realities they believe in, and how that leads to a (chosen, not inflicted) life of suffering, a cross to opt to bear. Stanislaw Lem, who wrote the book in the 1960s and who was profoundly influenced by quantum theory, has written that he didn't want to see this version because it so much focused on the love story between Rheya and Kelvin, but that just seems completely misguided. Why would the theories he is talking about not address love and emotion? These -- like reality, consciousness, space, time -- are among of the defining forces of human existence, and they are perfectly at home among these more expected sci-fi concepts. Indeed, the parallels drawn between the love/sci-fi genres are what make this film such a brilliant, unusual and engaging endeavor.Here's hoping Soderbergh releases an extended director's cut, with more of everything in it (including the enthralling footage of the planet and station, together with Cliff Martinez's beautiful score). He wanted it to be short; understandable, but it would work much longer as well.",

The film runs at a slightly slower pace than what most general audiences are used to, however, the highly introspective film has many pay-offs and is definitely worth the wait.This is Soderbergh's second remake of the past two years, adapting Andrei Tarkovsky's Russian-language masterpiece Solaris that won the Special Jury Prize at Cannes film festival in 1972. Chris Kelvin, (George Clooney) is called aboard an endangered American space station orbiting the planet Solaris.  Chris is told that there are many strange occurrences aboard the ship, which cannot be explained and that he is the only one who has a chance of remedying the situation. Once arrived, Chris finds the space station rather quiet and desolate, with one of the passengers' dead and the remaining two near psychological breakdown.  Dr. Gordon, a physiologist, and Snow, a tech-nerd, have seen and experienced things beyond what they know to be reality.  After close examination of both passengers, Chris has trouble believing their reports, until he too, has a similar experience of his own.  Manifestations of the past come to haunt Chris and he must decipher between what is reality and what isn't.This is definitely one of Soderbergh's best films to date, stepping away from mainstream Hollywood films, (Ocean's Eleven) as he does so well, and producing a great combination of both art and entertainment. This is very thoughtful film involving heavy subject manner, which is dealt with great delicacy.  Kubrick's 2001:A Space Odyssey comes to mind, both in terms of great visual style and content.",

It seems to me that, more often than not, when an average American film audience sees something it doesn't understand in a movie it seeks to dismiss it as garbage rather than looking harder into what themes or ideas are being explored. I think this is a criticism of the trash that regularly comes from Hollywood rather than of the American public.Despite the restraints of the Hollywood system, there are still good films trickling out, and Solaris is one of them. Solaris, like The Limey, deals mainly with the theme of time, memory, and how they affect the way we perceive our relationships with others. The main character in Solaris, like the main character in The Limey, is trapped in a situation where he is forced to look to the past and consider what went wrong and whether he is responsible, and if so, to what degree.The style of the film, and the fashback, flashforward organization of both films gives the viewer the feeling of experiencing the film in the past, present, and future simultaneously (isn't that how we all live our lives to some degree). It can be confusing, but for anyone who has been in a relationship with someone who is a little unstable this movie will be heartbreaking. Too bad some people don't get it.

Somebody who is expecting to be shocked, scared or told what is happening in a film.The score which seemed so cold and distant to me on first viewing is also one of the best ever written, both enigmatic and thought-provoking.The fact that Clooney seemed to be slightly lost playing a character of this complexity and depth only served to enhance his character who himself feels vulnerable on board the space station.Soderberg is one of the best directors of the moment - if only he could stop working with Julia Roberts!",

            "content": "Thoughtful, intelligent and touching, Solaris demands some patience although ironically one of its failings is that it is too short! It is almost as if Steven Soderbergh realised that this movie wouldn't be to the taste of much of the cinema-going public and didn't want to try their patience.I have not read Lem's book, but I am lead to believe that it deals much more with the nature of Solaris itself and less with the relationship between the two leads. This relationship forms the major plot of the movie and this is something of a problem - we are left knowing nothing at all about the nature of Solaris or the nature of the intelligence that it contains. Perhaps this is also true of the novel. I would have liked much more to be made of the idea of this as a \"first contact\" situation - how would one cope if an alien intelligence chose to communicate in this way? Instead, the story is reduced to a \"rationalism versus faith\" parable in which a man confident in his objective, atheist view of reality is forced to follow his heart instead of his head to exorcise his past.That said, there is much here to enjoy. Natascha McElhone is perfectly cast as the mysterious Rheya. She is just utterly captivating whenever she is on screen. George Clooney plays George Clooney as usual, but turns in a competent performance. Viola Davis and Jeremy Davies are less effective - I can't help get the feeling that Davis was cast mainly because she is both female and black and they didn't want a stereotypical male, white physicist. As a scientist, the Gordon character seems awfully keen to want to destroy phenomena that are both extraordinary and unique - falling back on primitive fear instead of cool analysis.The enigmatic Solaris itself is beautifully rendered. Living up to its name it looks like a movie sequence from the solar SoHo probe studying our own star. Prominences and what could almost be cascades of alien, intelligent thought sweep across its surface. We're not even sure if it is supposed to be a star or a planet or an alien being. Coupled with the sparse soundtrack I found the Solaris object to be hypnotic. And surely it was intentional that it looks like a human ovum in that final shot?8/10",

As a result, I can only conclude that they failed. The movie is far from awful, and movies (being the subjective beings they are) can be wonderful or otherwise, depending on the viewer. While I can understand and appreciate people loving this movie for whatever it is, it misses the mark completely when attempting to convey anything that Lem had in mind when he wrote the book. One might say that everything present in the book is in the movie, and this is essentially true, but content isn't all. The book is structured to give the reader a realistic sense of what a truly alien encounter might be like, but the film glazes over this and seems to focus on something else (to be honest, I'm not entirely sure what). Without trying to undermine anyone's interpretation of the movie, I must say it really isn't Sci-Fi at it's best and fails to give any meaningful insight into the infinite possibilities of the genre.

The end scene said it all, what I originally took as flashbacks from a clinically depressed guy appeared to be in correspondence to reality, and what you really have is a love story with a sub story embedded inside.This type of movie would have been better left to story. To those who disagree try actually reading. A book can offer a more driving story then a movie can, it can better reflect on the emotional aspect because words can touch multiple senses.

            "content": "Solaris is a throwback to the kind of film that Hollywood made for a time in the 1970s, but hardly makes anymore.  Although movies from the genre of sci-fi/fantasy have dominated the pantheon of blockbuster movies, this is not one of them.  Solaris is more like the anti-blockbuster; its commercial prospects are grim.  It's being marketed as science-fiction/romance film, but fundamentally it's about the human condition, guilt, regret, forgiveness, loneliness, the existence (or non-existence) of God, and our attempts at connection with our fellow travellers.  It reminded me of the Kurt Weill song \"Lost in the Stars\" about how we were created by God, but He's left us, abandoned us to drift in space.We find out during a dinner party, that the lead character, Chris Kelvin, is an atheist and doesn't believe in God.  Human relationships should be very precious for people like him, because once it's over, once you're dead, that's it.  A lot of believers are comforted by the prospects of being reunited with your loved ones in an everlasting afterlife.  Chris Kelvin doesn't have that luxury.  The movie suggests that human relationships are very fragile and also touches upon the fundamental impossibility of really knowing another person.  The best we can really hope for is knowing ourselves.  But we should try our best to look past ourselves and get out there and make connections, to alleviate our loneliness, and not take them for granted.  After he threatens to leave his wife Rheya in a fit of rage, she commits suicide.  Many Christians believe that suicide causes your soul to be lost and damned.  So whether God exists or not, Chris and Rheya are pretty well screwed.  One of the taglines for the movie is \"How far will you go for a second chance?\"  Well, if you're Chris Kelvin, I'm guessing pretty damn far.I found Solaris to be similar to these movies:Vertigo (romantic illusions and not really knowing another person)Last Tango in Paris (as above, plus the suicide angle)A.I. Artificial Intelligence (meeting your maker, redemption, mortality)Blade Runner (as above)The Remains of the Day (regret, loneliness)If you liked any or, better yet, all of the above films, the chances are good that you'll appreciate Solaris.  If you hated those movies, Solaris is not for you.  This film is one challenging piece of work, \"slow\" and filled with \"intellectual\" themes and may bring out uncomfortable feelings.  If you're looking for action, don't go to Solaris.One of the year's best. (9/10)",

However abnormal occurrances have plagued the team including the suicide of the team leader and the appearance to the crew of persons from their past experience, who cannot possibly be physically present (some are known to be dead) in the survey ship.Enter psychologist Chris Kelvin (George Clooney), charged with dispeling the problems/\"hallucinations\", only to be beset by them himself in overwhelming measure when his dead wife appears, not once but twice (the first he ejects from the ship in an escape pod).The presence of physicist and hard rationalist Gordon (Viola Davis) does much to prevent the crew (and plot) from disintegrating into a babble of mumbo-jumbo mysticism. There are no detectable psychotropic agents which could be causing the crew to imagine these occurances. The beings rather, are constructs from the memories of the persons who knew them, created somehow by Solaris itself. As such, they are what the person who knew them thinks they were, rather than the original person. But very real enough. They exhibit an almost indestructibility (if injured or killed, they shortly self-resurrect), though Gordon develops a method of dispelling them using exotic radiation.While all understand with their minds that the appearance of these beings is undesirable (\"What if this was to spread to Earth\" screams Gordon), emotion overwhelms reason and Kelvin is determined to hold onto this remnant of his wife, however imperfect. There are tense moments between Gordon and Kelvin.The ending is anti-climactic and enigmatic. It is Gordon who makes the decision to return to Earth carrying the rest of the crew with her (they seem incapable of any making any significant decisions). The crew don't fall into a senseless slaughter of each other, nor do the beings suddenly turn hostile. In the deja vu sequence near the film's very end, Kelvin finds himself on Earth and cuts himself (again) while preparing a meal. While attending to the wound, he is arrested by the sudden appearance of his wife. He asks, \"Am I alive... or dead?\" She assures \"We don't have to think like that anymore. We're together now. Everything we've done is forgiven. Everything.\" They fall into a long, clinging embrace which dissolves into the image of Solaris, now very reminicient of an embryo.",

Starting as a sci fi movie and crossing over into horror before submitting itself to a love story, Solaris uses multiple genres as tools for creating an overall emotional response to the storyline.Attempts to easily define this film will lead to frustration and possible irritation with the film itself- Comparisons to '2001' are unfair:  \"2001\" was resolved with sheer sci-fi wonder - that took place in an almost inhumanly cold and detached narrative. \"Solaris\" is the sum of such wonder coupled with a love story, and a deeply internal treatise on some difficult to answer questions. Some have accused it of being slow, and despite the repeated use of slow, still shots of the stillness of the space station, the film is only an hour and a half, and solves its first mystery in 20 minutes.This answer to the question, \"What's going on at Solaris?\" only provokes mutliple new questions, some of which are unravelled by the movie's end. Even if as a viewer you don't hang on every shot you'll be more than occupied thinking about the significance of the ideas presented, and providing answers where there simply aren't any.

I  will take a more balanced approach.In my opinion, the movie could have been much more but some clear flaws make it mostly incompatible with the expectations of most people. Also the advertising and trailers made me believe I would see something much better than this movie actually delivered.The visual appearance of the space station orbiting Solaris (the planet or neutron star or whatever that may be) is great. This was definitely somewhat inspired by Kubrick's 2001. However this image is used too often in this movie. The soundtrack is unconventional and fits the mood and slow pace of this movie.Unfortunately the plot development is truly banal and in many aspects unsatisfactory. Here I have to agree with those critics who found those movie boring and uninspired.We get to see Clooney enter a space station where people have previously gone mad. Some committed suicide, others have been murdered. Obviously there have been violent fights on this space station. This is a promising lead-in and setting, similar to the movie \"Event Horizon\".So the audience is led into expecting a continuation of this violent theme. But there is no continuation of this. Not at all. So why did the movie show us bloodstains in the first place?There is only very few surprises in this movie. One being that everyone on the station is haunted by a mysterious visitor created by Solaris. This mysterious visitor is a construct of every person's most intense memories. So our antagonist's beloved wife reappears in physical form. By means of flashbacks and dream sequences the audience learns that his wife is long dead because she had committed suicide years ago.This unnatural visitor acts human and even experiences human emotions herself - yet she cannot possibly be human because there is no rational explanation for her existence. Also when she gets injured or killed she magically heals or reappears hours later. Slowly realizing that she is not a true human being she is getting desperate and suicidal.Still the antagonist played by Clooney misses his wife so much that he decides to embrace and accept that thing which looks like his wife. And all that is neither particularly credible nor logical. At the end of  the movie you will keep asking yourself \"Why? I don't understand this character. I don't see why he acted this way.\".The other two remaining characters living on this space station hardly contribute to the plot development. This movie could have delivered so much more if this story had not focused so much on the banal love story element. The director should have replaced the banality with a bit more suspense, mystery and maybe some violence. Catering for the audience's expectations is a bare necessity: Either deliver what people expect or present the unexpected! This movie does neither.The movie tries to be intelligent and thoughtful, but in that it fails. All that remains is a terribly slow pace where people actually expected to see some terrible mysteries revealed. Overall the movie presents no answers to a lot of open questions.  I don't see how this movie got funding in the first place and was marketed like this - given the uninspired script.Rating: 4 out of 10.",

I felt slightly irritated by some of the editing - I mean the scene with George Clooney's butt - What the hell was that in aid of?It wasn't artistic it was just daft! Anyway I didn't let that spoil the film. The film unfolds slowly and methodically posing questions along the way - flashing back to his past life while he sleeps. The whole film is dreamlike.As for the Acting well George is great and does well. Jeremy Davies is awful and frankly let's the whole film down. Whenever he's in a scene he overacts and is painful to watch. The other actors do so well - how the hell did he get into the cast?I must say when it ended I didn't have that open question on my mind that I've had when watching \"2001\", \"The Shining\", \"Jacobs Ladder\" You know the feeling I'm on about - I know exactly what the film was striving for but sadly it didn't quite hit the spot.

Critics and friends have opinions that can help shape our expectations of a movie and sometimes the title alone can give off connotations that put you in a certain mindset about the film. Solaris is science fiction and this genre of film probably lends itself to the most preconceived ideas of what a movie should deliver so it's no wonder so many people were disappointed. Solaris would definitely get full points for set design, acting & mystery but it is not an action movie nor is it an `effects' movie, although the effects that it did have were well done. I would classify Solaris as a 'thinking' movie. Considering myself a true sci-fi fan, I very much enjoyed Solaris, although I'd heard it was boring, I still wanted to see it and knew what I was getting into. That being said I thought it was great. I particularly liked the performance given by Viola Davis who played Gordon, she gave such solid believability to the role that it makes me want to see other films she's done.",

            "content": "I should point out that I didn't see the whole film - I only caught the second half. But what I saw was extremely intriguing. Two things in particular struck me. First, the pace, and accompanying music; it's a film that creeps over you at an invisible pace, and the hypnotic music does a lot to keep you sitting there. As said by other users, the pace we're used to in films, particularly sci-fi - crash, bang, wallop, atomic explosion - makes Solaris a challenge until you settle into it, but the mesmerising, haunting music has a way of fixing you where you sit, while the film's essence seeps into you.Second, the film's interesting exploration of ideas about reality: the reality of the world and people around us, and of ourselves; the part our memories play in defining and historically preserving reality and the form of our lives. It's not a theme that could have been well explored in a sensational, typically 'Hollywood' film; the effect would have been crass and not a little superficial. The pace of Solaris - what I saw of it, at least - allows one to think about the ideas present while the film slowly unfolds. A line towards the end - I don't know if it constitutes a spoiler but I'll assume it does - particularly intrigued me: \"I performed all the millions of gestures that constitute life on Earth. But I was haunted by the idea that I remembered her wrong... that I was wrong about everything.\" It's a film that takes patience and concentration, and rewards you with moving, understated performances, a feeling of quiet unsettlement, and hours of afterthought. I'd like to see the entire thing... as well as the Russian original, and Lem's novella.",

He gets lost in long sections of scenery and techno-babble but forgets about the \"heart\" of the movie.  This story is so character driven - and to call it a \"romance in space\" is no insult.  The movie is better than the book because of what Lem doesn't do, and Soderbergh does do.Rheya - Natascha McElhone's character - finally realizes she's not a real person but a \"creation\" of the sentient planet Solaris.  She committed suicide years ago and the planet creates her from Chris Kelvin's (George Clooney) memories.  The heart of it all is that she says to Chris that she is suicidal because that is how she remembers herself.  The great wisdom in the movie is when he realizes that he remembered her wrong, though he never stopped loving her.The great twist that they add to the movie is that Snow (Jeremy Davies) isn't a real person but a \"creation\", and right from the start of the movie there are little clues to it.  Sort of like \"The Sixth Sense\" but you only see it after you've seen the whole movie.  This one bit just blew me away.This movie is great - even for those who never read the book - and I think it would have had better reviews if it hadn't been George Clooney.  He's good, but the story really is the winner here.10 out of 10.",

            "review_title": "Had potential but is let down by a dull and tedious pace",
            "content": "MINOR SPOILERSThe premise for Solaris is an excellent one. This is a futuristic science fiction scenario (something I am always attracted to) directed and readapted (this is a remake I believe) by Steven Soderbergh who has been on a excellent roll with the great films such as Erin Brokavich, Traffic and Ocean's Eleven. George Clooney stars as Chris Kelvin, an astronaut/scientist who has lost his wife, Rheya played by Natascha McElhone (Ronin, The Truman Show).The film begins with sad, depressed Clooney struggling to carry on in life without her. As the film continues, he regularly has happy dreams of being with her. Eventually, he is called up to travel to and board a space station orbitting some distant yet eerily beautiful planet called Solaris where he has to investigate some strange phenomena. When he finally gets there, he discovers that not only are the crew experiencing apparations of their own past and memories but so is he, of his wife. As baffled and surprised as he is, he tries to come to terms with what is happening. Are the crew hallucinating? Is Solaris inducing these hallucinations? Are they hallucinations at all or are they real beings mirroring their memories? Clooney tries to consider all these question with the crew while at the same time getting reaquainted with his wife and trying to right the wrongs of the past.However, a quarter of the way through the film, I just couldn't care anymore. The film wasn't that long (about 1 hour 30 min) but it seemed much longer. The film is beautifully shot with some nice set and FX, and the score is soothing and appropriate for the film. The acting is adequate. I particularly like quirky, oddball scientist, Snow played by Jeremy Davies (Saving Private Ryan). But these are the only merits I can honestly bring up. I was bored, really bored, watching this film. It dragged on and on with slow, dreamy flashbacks of Clooney and McElhone. I tried to believe that there was actually a point to the whole film, some explanation of the unexplainable. Questions are raised such as the meaning of life, religion and the universe mixed up with a story of love, loss and redemption but I could not find any answers. Although I usually like McElhone, her character somewhat annoyed me with her whining and mood swings and, well, she seemed to be so boring and an effort to spend time with and so I couldn't really see anything attractive about her. I find that her character actually lends strength to the dullness I experienced. On the whole, I regard this film a bit of a mess with no direction or purpose. The sci-fi distant planet setting is simply a background for this story which could easily have been set in any place where weird things happen (ie. a spooky archeoligical dig). Whenever technical jargon is mentioned it feels like it was ripped off some Star Trek TNG episode. I get the feeling that it was trying to match the mystery (if not the grandeur) of 2001: A Space Oddessey which is also another long, slow sci-fi film with mysterious goings on but on the contrary is actually captivating and revelating.I may be wrong though. Perhaps there are explanations or answers somewhere in there but I was too bored by then to care and I couldn't be bothered to think about the meaning of the film as I usually do with other films that aim to stir thought and intelligent discussion. Soderbergh, an excellent director, has misfired on this one and no amount of special effects, cast quality or score is really going to compensate for the tedium he has presented us with. Disappointing really as I was rather looking forward to this one.Overall Rating 5/10",

I can see already how some of my fellow reviewers, even those that do this professionally, will walk away claiming that is boring or confusing, when in fact it is one of the more simple Sci-Fi movies I've ever had to explain.The thing you have to ask yourself at the end is, would you go as far as the main character did to be with the one he loves?I give it an 8 out of 10.

Here enjoying the movie without knowing the plot ahead of time would be a serious impediment (I was lucky to have red Stanislav Lev story beforehand). I can imagine myself watching this movie over and over, and definitely plan to buy it on DVD when it is out.This movie made me think what is real in life and what is not, what is of value in life and what is not, what is a true life, what does it mean to be human, if there is anything after death - then what, what is God, etc. The multitude of themes subtly collide at the unusual angles under the surface of the seemingly slowly developing movie, which makes it difficult to get into. But if you will get into it, you may end up thinking about it - and about values in your life - for a long time, finding source of strength and inspiration.Most people in the theater hated it. I think it is one of the movie you hate the 1st time around and love more and more with each consequent time.

            "content": "First off I must say that this film was exactly what I thought it would be. A love story set in space with elements if sci/fi. What I didn't expect was the minimalist approach to the material. There is little talking, and even less musical cues to tell us what we should be feeling. In fact I think that this is one of the least manipulative films I've seen and that is what I really appreciate about it. So many films rely on a sweeping soundtrack and flowery emotional speeches in an attempt to manipulate the audience into artificially 'feeling' something. Not in this version of Solaris by Steven Soderbergh, and it's all the better for it in my opinion. This doesn't make it an emotionless affair. There are strong emotions here, especially for the Rheya/Kelvin characters. But in this case, we are seeing those emotions possibly like the planet Solaris would see and interpret them, in a detached yet fascinating kind of way.As the film progressed I became aware that, with the exception of the Jeremy Davies character, these people were acting in a very real, humanistic way. When you are deeply troubled and in emotional pain the first instinct is to hide it from everyone else. If someone asks us how we are doing today, the automatic response is usually \"pretty good\" even though we may feel the exact opposite. But, if we bottle those feelings long enough, others can begin to see the cracks in the facade. We start to look tired and empty. We may become irritable and withdrawn. This is how the characters in the film are. Carrying around their personal demons while trying to put up a good front.But Solaris apparently can see right through them. Is it toying with them, or trying to understand and sooth their pain by externalizing it and encouraging them to work through it? What is Solaris? Benevolent alien intelligence? A metaphor for the mind of god? A phenomena that, simply by it's own nature, mindlessly mirrors and reflects our deepest desires and regrets? In the end we are left to decide for ourselves. There may be no wrong answer as the movie is rich in symbolism and allegory which leaves it very open to different interpretations.I have a feeling that a second viewing might illuminate a great many things. All in all a very satisfying cinematic experience far from the usual hollywood sensibilities when taken on it's own and not compared to the book or the other Tarkovsky film.",

Alive peoples bodies dead on the ship. Like it made sense. The planet is Solaris. But why did they make this? If they are doing it for sentiment then they didn't get anything in response. It was lively, but was senseless. It was very slow. Deliberation was slow and very pacing. It's very uneven. It wasn't confusing; I just want to know what Solaris did. But what was its purpose? It obviously did something to create a memory person. But how. The reason why I mostly hate it is because there are too many unanswered questions. And the whole premise and idea of Solaris is just dumb, not beautiful.",

            "content": "*****MILD SPOILERS AHEAD (not about the end though)****After having been through most comments posted here, I'm not really surprised to realize that, while some people loved the movie, some found it boring, to put it mildly.First, let me put it bluntly: I loved this movie. But depending on the mood the day I first saw it, I feel like I could have found a better way to spend my time. The line between the two feelings being a thin one.There are undeniable qualities to this movie: first, the music. I hadn't heard an original music that fit so well the movie since Requiem For a Dream. But unlike that of RfaD, where the music would become overwhelming, that of Solaris makes itself non-remarkable, being but another hint at the characters' state of mind, therefore brilliantly serving what should ultimately be a soundtrack's purpose (understand: compared to all those movies which just use the latest hits as loud as possible in order to sound cool, no matter if the songs actually fit what's going on). Secondly, and I know that some here don't share that view, but the visuals and the photography were stunning, and I loved the contrast between the colors used in the scenes on Earth and those aboard the station, which give most scenes this dreamy aura, again completely fitting the story. Also a word about the actors: they are very few speaking parts, but all of them have been cast well, with Clooney showing us yet another face of his talent and Natasha McEhlone simply excellent in the difficult part of Rheya, Clooney's Kelvin's deceased wife, who is the emotional core of the movie.Now about the storytelling in itself: of course, this covers only part of the book, or the original movie for that matter. But this is one of those stories where, unlike Lord of the Rings for instance, there is no real point of retelling the same story word by word. THAT would have been a waste of everybody's time. Instead, Soderbergh chooses to focus on some of the themes, namely the loss, the need for redemption, and the choices we make.But don't expect long and loud theories about all this. Don't expect moral judgments about the characters' actions. Instead, you are shown facts, the slow pace of the film allowing you space and time to put in your own thoughts and feelings.And this maybe for some the problem, and why lots of people have considered this film boring: they are times when no words are said, and little is done. Even at times, the music is completely gone, a kind of pace we're not used to in today's Occidental movie making (compared to Asian's cinema and animation)and that something that we tend to be almost afraid of somehow, like when at dinner when everyone run out of good words and pleasantries and all is left is silence. We always feel uncomfortable, because all we're left with is ourselves. Some days, we can face it. Some days, we cannot.This is exactly what happens with this movie, which, at core, is a mirror to some of our own basic human feelings, and not necessarily those we're always ready to deal with. Therefore, instead of getting dragged, we're are actually asked to participate to this emotional (and NOT intellectual) journey.But are you ready for it?*******************************Luckily for me, I was, and this is why I gave it 9/10, as I've been treated with one of the most powerful emotional journey cinema over the last few years.",

I was, to borrow a clich\u00e9, 'on the edge of my seat'.I remember seeing the original Russian film on a bad, grainy, bootlegged tape many years ago....and NOT being able to sit through it...but I will be looking for it again as I, and my tastes have matured, I suspect I may have disregarded something special.Like this film.",

            "content": "First of all i've seen the Soviet version and read the book by Lem. although it's sightly different from the original version the message it conveys is the same. Some accuse this movie of being bored and slow, but that is just its nature. The movie is confusing because of its flashbacks and ending, which i cannot truly understand. But i think everyone could understand it. I must confess that the movie left me without any sleep for a night, on the contrary of most people. I like somewhat Sci-fi movies, (that is why i saw it,) but the Future Space thing is just the setting. the movie in essence deals about Human nature itself, it present to us self evident question that might never be answered or that have no answer, such as \"What is real and what's not? The movie shows the human natural tendency to destroy, but it also show us that hope, faith and love can overcome those, (wonderfull message) It is a movie that if you think about it, you will realize it's greatness. The character of George Clooney is the skeptical science man that looks for an answer and at the end is overcomes by faith, Gordon fears the unknown as we all do, and feels threatened by the presence of people who are suppose to be dead. She argues about the human quality of these people, but she does not think about her human quality when she overcome her fears by extinguishing the life of those who might or might not be humans, but still have the right to live. From my point of view they are as humans as we are since they are an in essence the same as those who died. We see that when Gibarian (the mission commander) Return to life and speaks of his mistake to commit suicide. Snow as hard to believe is the one that best understand the current situation, he seems mad because it is a very confusing idea. In essence the movie convey us the message that some things are beyond our understanding, we must just accept them. If Rheya brought happiness to Kelving, what does it matter if she was or not human, or if she was real, for him it was the same person, (not the person he wants her to be, if so she wouldn't have the suicide tendency.) She and the other as well seems very real to me, and can you define the limits of reality. Many other movies and books are just as inspiring as this one,(Sphere, Abyss, Blade Runner and many more), the idea of making your thought real is a frightening one. I hope you like this movie and that you cant sleep that day, the Russian version is worse in technology but good in its message, i strongly recommend it as well as the original Book. And nerve fear the unknown and the incomprehensible, just learn how to accept it.",

            "content": "All I knew of the movie in advance had been some short reviews and a brief look on the website. So I was really not expecting a science fiction spectacle like ID4 or STTNG. I guess I was hardly expecting anything at all. And this was good!I guess reviews and opinions have been somewhat controversial, I acknowledge that in several theatres people have moved out on the movie. Not so in the screening I attended. The cinema was packed with people (O.K. merely 150 seats), they were even sitting on the stairway! Nobody left during the movie, and at least half the people stayed until the very end of the credits. Now that is a scene I do not experience too often!I quickly agreed with my girlfriend that this movie was truly a piece of art - some 30 seconds into the movie. And we were not at all disappointed. I might compare it to `Out of Sight', another Soderbergh/Clooney feature that I like very much but actually many people do not. And of course some comparison to 2001 imposed itself. I liked very much how this movie challenged my spirit and provoked my thoughts.I am not going to recite the storyline, but I have to say I was deeply touched by the tragic of `new' Rheyas consciousness. Her urge to know what and who she was. And the sudden realization not to know whether anybody was `himself' anymore. Finalized by Chris' concern not to have remembered Rheya rightly.In no means this movie is fast paced or swift. It takes its time and gives the viewer time to orientate himself or - more likely -  to experience the disorientation of the characters. I was a little afraid the movie might conclude in some action feature shoot-out or similar. Fortunately this was not the case. The movies draws the complete circle back to the beginning and eventually leaves the viewer in awe.Finally I would like to express my sincere appreciation for the movies photography and editing. The focus/blur effects really contributed to center my attention. The choice of camera angels also did involve me so much more than the usual depictures of scenes. And the edited sequence of shots and scenes built just the right tension.A 9 out of 10! Really great, great cinema!",

There were obvious parallels to our own circumstances in that Rheya ponders her existence--knows she has been created by the planet--but doesn't for what purpose and cannot communicate with her creator.  I thought it had a 'spirituality' message--I even think I saw the old \"God in the Sistine Chapel\" shot at the end when Kelvin reaches out to the little boy.Also, maybe it was also a closer look at the human condition.    Juxtapose Kelvin's reaction at his wife's abortion, and later, shooting wife copy no. 1 into space. The message being your morality can and will change, depending on your circumstances.  I also like that Kelvin is human--and not one dimensional.  Its refreshing actually to see a bit of weakness in a \"hero\". I think that whole 'don't tell copy no. 1' stuff is hilarious.I liked the Kubrick-ey space shots--what else can you do? I'll think of them as 'tributes'--of course, the space station was the best and most realistic ever.  The soundtrack was good.I like that there are questions unanswered.  Like the 'formula' isn't that dead people from your past come back to life--cause Snow makes a copy of himself...we don't know what Gordon's visitor is, and doesn't Gibarian's son exist on earth?  Kelvin copies himself--so maybe he was a copy already when he got there?  Who knows?I always like sublety and get annoyed when I am hit on the head with the 'answers'.So for me I took away alot from the movie--the who are we and what are we doing here anyway theme.  They didn't attempt to answer the question--the whole point was to pose the question.  As individuals, we have to answer that one ourselves in our own way.and like the characters in the movie--its probably unanswerable.",

What makes the film interesting is that it sounds out the questions without in any way seeking to supply the answers, except to suggest that those answers cannot be trite. It cleverly references 2001 A Space Odyssey. I think it needs two or three views to get the full benefit, but it does re-pay repeated watching.",

Solaris is one of the best films ever made about the power of memory, the ways we deal with pain and the unknown, and how real love is transcendent.The music and visuals (especially of Solaris itself) are hauntingly visceral in a way I can't even completely convey. The cast is dead on perfect. The story is a very simplified, economic version of the original (which in this case works just fine) and deals more with the human factor than the science. It's a shame that more people couldn't get into this movie and disliked it because it didn't meet their expectations of what a science fiction should be; Solaris dealt with consequence, love, perception, fear, reason, spirituality, and death in a way that some of the most brilliant pure dramas have never even come close to capturing. This is one of the best sci-fi films ever made and hardly anyone seems to know about it. To call it underrated is an insult to an underrated movie. Solaris has been overlooked completely, even within the sci-fi community. Of those that did see it, many didn't really get what the film is about. (I blame the marketing campaign for that to some degree, trying to sell an action or horror sci-fi movie when this film was neither of those things.) They couldn't embrace the subtle, constant tension and unconventional, subversive, underlying themes. Spiritual science fiction is one way to describe it. A haunting, hard journey of man facing his memory, his \"sins\" made flesh, literally. Solaris is painfully insightful about relationships and the way we remember events and people to a degree that again, words can't capture. The end of Kelvin's journey is something that people can talk about again and again, trying to figure out what really happened to him.Did he ever finally get \"home\"?",

For instance, a giddy fantasist could conclude that the main character has reached out to an alien life form and has fallen in love with it: a real wham-bang love story. A determined sci-fi fan might see Blade-Runner-style tragedy. A prodigiously sane person completely unexperienced in mental illness might suppose that main character succumbs to madness. A quick cynic might conclude that passive-aggressive aliens adroitly manipulate the main character's unresolved feelings of love and guilt re: his suicide wife to achieve their nefarious ends. A Socratic person might conclude that if such is the case, the main characters's embrace (a la Cypher in The Matrix) of an illusory \"wife\" in favor of reality is pitiable. A moralist might find the same choice reprehensible; an existentialist, absurd; an aestheticist, disgusting.I don't subscribe to the any of the more generous interpretations. In fact, I am deprived of any interpretation at all, because the story failed to sustain my interest. I freely admit to fast-forwarding through many of the dull silences and duller (though fast-cut) dialog. The picture did not create enough of an illusion for me to suspend my disbelief sufficiently to care about what was actually happening. Here is why the execution, in my view, failed: 1. In what is actually a short picture, the pace is glacial and the film at times downright boring, especially after it is clear that these \"aliens,\" if aliens they are, intend to employ only mild-mannered psychology and low-key guilt trips to obtain their ends (as opposed to ray-guns, spatulas, creepy mind-f#@ks, or anything else that might possibly inspire fear). If any kind of tension is to be sustained, the \"visitors\" phenomena ought to be able to inspire dread of some kind in the viewer. This side of the balance fails however because there is no fight in the main character, who falls for the aliens' machinations almost immediately, with the unsurprising result that the human stakes are too low. We might feel pity for this weak-willed guilt-sodden sap, but hardly fear. Conversely, if one tries to interpret the \"visitors\" phenomena in a positive light, tension also fails, for the same reason: it is obvious that the love-smitten main character will do nothing to harm these visitors. Likewise, that the only other human crew member (if she IS human -- you decide), partly because she is so underdeveloped, likewise poses no real danger to any friendlies. Furthermore, one never gets the impression that the phenomena, however interpreted, represent any ill to the main character that amounts to even one-third of a hill of beans. The main character just isn't man enough.2. Some reviewers clearly were impressed with the emotional reality of the main character-\"wife\"/visitor relationship. I didn't find much emotional depth, despite all of the in-your-face edits. If we are to be able to imagine we are viewing a picture in which a main character is faced with aliens, human-shaped vorpal bunnies, self-created revenants, mental illness, what have you, the picture ought to be more frightening. Instead, we are left with a main character who weakly succumbs to phenomena that somehow manage to be more soporific than anything else, probably because they spend most of the picture rehashing the main character's relationship with his dead wife.

Clooney and McElhone are wonderful.  Soderbergh should be well on his way to Oscar nominations for best direction and screenplay, and so should Clooney for best actor.  I was struck at how emotionally moved I was while watching this film.  I had tears streaming down my face at times.  This came as quite a surprise.The screenplay is wonderfully ambiguous.  There may be strong spiritual, mystical, and religious undercurrents at work here.  But, then again, maybe not.  I expect this film will generate a good deal of discussion. Without giving too much away, I wonder how many saw the reference to \"Adam and God\" painting of the Sistine Chapel?This is a fabulous film.  It goes right up to the top of my list of favorite sci-fi films.  Truly serious sci-fi films are rare.  I hope this film goes on to become a major critical and financial success.George",

The recent movie version (George Clooney) is better than the book because it completes the theme of \"How do I know I'm 'real'?\" The book leaves this theme incomplete and ends on a note of love lost.So how is this theme demonstrated? or are there hints to be carried into our own lives? In the book, Rheya listens to the conversations of the others, observes her own absence of memory about how she arrived and concludes that she isn't 'real.' In the movie, Rheya's reasoning process is very powerful tool to use in our own lives. I won't reveal what it is in this review.The book seems to meander off trail into a lot of unnecessary back story and fantasy about gods. The movie stays tightly focused on what does it mean to be real and how to we know it. It took me a while (a couple of years) to recognize the value of the lessons of the movie.

Soderberg does not try to do a remake, or a film of the book, he does what anyone who has any sense does. he takes the idea that works in the book. and changes it to work as an excellent film. the combination of the screenplay, directing, acting and cliff Martinez' awesome, atmospheric soundtrack all come together and make Solaris nothing short of a masterpiece.The film is really like an art exhibition in a way, some people may not enjoy, but if you're going to watch it, do so with an open mind and just enjoy the truly superb piece of film making.",

However if I didn't like the film, they wouldn't have convinced me otherwise.  Luckily the film was very good, both cinematically and with good acting performances. During the interview, both their comments on Solaris backed up what I had been thinking throughout the film.I admit that it could have been better with more background on the planet itself and what had previously happened, and was perhaps a little too short to do the source material justice. However Soderbergh's  focusing on the relationship between Kelvin and his wife, and his questioning of what was human, did really work. It had echoes of the similar theme in Bladerunner.I didn't surprise me it hasn't done that well in the US, as I can't name any other, non action sci-fi film that has, 2001: A Space Odyssey being the exceptionIn summary I'd rather see Sci-fi films like this, than any number of asteroid blasting gung-ho kill the CGI alien film, that purport to be Sci-fi.  8/10 from me.",

I should know, I am one!I first saw this movie dead-beat on a plane back from New York, very very sleepy and was mostly captivated by the drifting music while I dozed off. That time around I was annoyed by the glamorous looking couple in the movie. However, I wanted to hear the music again so bought the DVD and re-watched it all the way through while wide awake. Now the whole movie seems like one long dream itself, haunting and beautiful. I agree that other movies, and the original movie and book, deal with philosophical issues at greater length, but despite being fairly cold itself, this is a film about emotions and is intensely visual. Lots of sly visual allusions to other films, including obvious ones to 2001, but that always was one crazy hippy movie!Anyway, I would definitely recommend this, 10/10, if you have time, and I agree with another commentator, watch it with your lover/partner!

Also for Solaris (2002) avoiding to elaborate too much makes Solaris (2002) more thrilling than the original.I have given both the 2002 and 1972 version an 8 of 10 stars. The original Solyaris is longer and the philosophical aspect is more elaborate, and I DO think it is better in many aspects.

First, the good: the film looks beautiful and the score lulls you into a relaxed, observatory state of mind. The cast are attractive and the worst of the anachronisms of Lem's book have been removed. There is actually a resolution to the movie and it is far more emotionally literate than either of the originals. Saying that there is much that has been messed about with to very little effect other than to ruin the intended plot. The essence of Solaris (the book) is an exploration into Man's (I do not mean to imply gender here) method of scientific analysis and how fallible that approach would be for an intelligence that exceeded their own. The only meaningful dialogue with the vast sentience that is Solaris comes from Kelvin's unresolved regret for the loss of Rheya, his love for her and the transmission of his unconscious thoughts to the planet itself. In this adaptation (mega-spoilers here): - Solaris itself appears never to have been studied or visited and the whole idea of the 'living sea' is lost.'Coroporations' (very 21st century and totally irrelevant to the plot) want to own Solaris as 'a possible energy source'. Again, why? This is both impossible (Steven do you understand *anything* about physics?) and detracts from one of the central points about the book which is Man's pure academic struggle to understand an intelligence greater than their own. The entire space station's library in the original(s) were devoted to decades of study into the phenomenon of Solaris. In the mythology of the book the planet has formed whole schools of thought and analysis - all lost hereBerton is lost from the plot and his son becomes Gibarian's. This character then becomes the representative of the planet. Neither the book or the Tarkovsky version needed this device so why do we in this film?Snow (Snaut) has become an alien. Why? It was not necessary to the plot. The planet never knowingly killed before (Jeremy Davies is definitely vying for the most irritating portrayal of a character ever.) There are rumours that this film was butchered for theatrical release and I sincerely hope that this was the case!",

Most of these definitely serve a purpose but take entirely too long and aren't particularly exciting to watch, being mostly dark and dim. Some of them feel arbitrary and purposefully stretched to boost the length of the film.It seems like Steven Soderbergh went out of his way to avoid exposition through dialogue, possibly out of fear of having it be too obvious or condescending. A lot of time is wasted on showing the audience that George Clooney is some kind of shrink. Yet, by the time he sets foot aboard the spaceship, we still have no idea what Solaris actually is or what kind of mission the crew is conducting. Simply knowing that might have greatly increased my enjoyment of the first half. The deliberate vagueness does not contribute to the sense of mystery at all, it just makes the characters less believable for not seeming all that bothered by it.Some credit is due for the way in which Soderbergh manages to portray the rather philosophical subject matter and have the characters explore and discuss it without breaking our suspension of disbelief. That being said, since none of this is technically original material, I think it's appropriate to base my rating mostly on artistic considerations. Intellect has little to do with one's enjoyment of this movie. It's definitely no Star Wars, but it's no 2001 either.

            "content": "Solaris is not a sequel, its not an action/adventure/science-fiction film or fantasy like A Star Wars or Terminator. It is way beyond opposite of all that. It is more of a dramatic, mysterious, romantic adventure in the future when a planet known as solaris is a place of energy. An energy source that would be able to contain a world with highly advanced, unwastefull or unpolluting energy. The energy source ends up being used for Earth, which brings our planet to a futuristic and highly advanced and sophisticated in mathematics and science in the energy's capability. I took the impression thats how Earth was futurelly-like. But this exotic and occasionally sexually active and erotic adventure passes like a wind blowing over a tight swindle.Starring George Clooney, and in definitely one of his most richest roles, he plays unusually in this bizarrely overrated motion picture. He is a hard-to-understand character. But in the beginning he is sent to a space-ship which impressionally is the central station for watching over Solaris. It moves around the planet like a satellite. While making sure the planet's energy is being reflected to Earth for good reasons. Strange and Bizarre activities have been happening on the ship lately. When Clooney gets their, he sees blood and dead people. He also sees blood coming from the vents on the ceiling. He realizes he and a co-pilot are the only ones left on the team. Once there were about seven of them. Clooney eventually asks what had happened, and the guy who really...speaks...like...this (the co-pilot) says a metaphorical statement. And throughout the entire movie, they don't even explain it once, which is one of the film's disappointments. But once clooney sleeps and wakes up in the middle of the night, seeing his wife (who supposedly died) is alive again. Thats where the confusion comes in. It is a mind-bending tale, with very good ideas.It shows a few long 10 minute flashbacks throughout the movie of Clooeny and his wife, their relationships, their romance, including their sex. Also when he brings her on the space station, and how he puts her in a small glass shuttle, and for some odd reason he presses the go button and lets her go off into space while she is still in their. While Clooeny's suspicion of her being dead, she appears back on the ship again. Then a random kid comes up, maybe a 7 year-old-kid. Later on, Clooney see's the co-pilot's dead body in the vents of the ceiling, which is where he had noticed the blood coming from the vents. While the co-pilot hangs out in his room, Clooney realizes that everything is just a memory. His wife who had randomly appeared on the ship was just a memory of what Clooney knows of her. Same goes for the co-pilot. Then Clooney realizes that the random kid is also just a memory. These memories that seem so real is by the strength of solaris which is how the memories are appearing in actual life.When solaris starts to implode, the co-pilot leaves, the girl just disappears, and clooney including the kid just sit in the ship, waiting for solaris to explode and kill them. It is somewhat a sad scene, Clooney's raw intensity in this scene is simply astounding. (personally the best scene of the movie). Then after Clooney dies, he's back at his house, and his wife stands their looking at him.Now, first of all this movie was absolutely the most boring movie I have ever seen. The first 20 minutes are purely raw intensity and deep in entertainment. But the rest is dreary, especially repetitive with sex and nudity. The movie is just about obsessed with it. But it is drenched Win confusion. The deliberation is always slow. The movie is slow. The movie sucks. It is the worst movie I have ever seen. Definitely up for the razzies. If you're expecting drama, expect MAJOR drama. Because it is an orall experience. These are good ideas with a terrible execution.Secondly, critics are idiots. Thye apparently loved this movie. You can see how, but I thought it was patchy, dry, dull, soulless, heartless, slow, weak, boring, and terrible. Whenever someone mentions this movie (which people never really do) I'll just laugh. Its lame. Its not anyones kind of movie, its easy to fall asleep in. What kind of a story is this. Its not even interesting. And having solaris' explosion is a lot bigger of a situation than how they should of reacted. Leaving isn't the answer. It is the Earth's frickin power source. Ultimately the world would fall apart. And the last scene was terrible. Made me feel even worse for this movie, the world is still alive, and it shows the wife appear again. Did Clooney die or just appear back at home? either way, the direction was awful, same with James Cameron's writing.THE WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN.1/10 -- if it can go lower: 0/10.",

While it's not exactly a faithful representation, it is a deeply atmospheric interpretation of the story.  George Clooney continues to impress me with his emotionally moving performance of Chris Kelvin, and Natascha McElhone is astonishing as his wife, Rheya.  Although I knew that I had to see this film, I had serious doubts going into it.  It may not be everyone's cup of tea, but in my opinion, by daring to create a film outside of the mainstream that interacts with the audience on an almost entirely emotional level, Mr. Soderbergh has made an important contribution to his art.

The film manages to perfectly achieve the tense atmosphere of the investigation into the mystery of existence around Solaris, and the heartache this causes the people there. The actual sci-fi is quite subdued in the movie, and this just made it more realistic for me personally (though this is the first time I've seen a Higgs field mentioned on-screen). I'm not convinced everyone in the future will wander around explaining all their technological marvels all the time like in some sf movies, and doing so just detracts from the storyline.

Other films are unabashed entertainment to thrill the masses.  And then there are films like SOLARIS. Films made for only one reason: to satisfy the egos of filmmakers who actually think they're saying something.It has become its own genre.This last kind of film has a small but earnest following.  And you can bet their audience will find meaning in ANY tale.  But you can also bet they'll never agree with each other on what that meaning IS.  Oh, but that's the point, you see.  It's \"interpretive\".  It's subjective.  We all see different meanings in it.  That's the whole beauty of it, they say.A similar kind of film is David Lynch's MULHOLLAND DRIVE.  And it would seem that people will tend to like or dislike both.  And if you come across someone who LIKES it, don't dare suggest it's awful -- or else it's assumed you're not intelligent enough to \"get it\". (Or perhaps just not creative enough to have imposed your own meaning upon it -- which, let's face it, if I wanted to WRITE the movie, I wouldn't have come to see YOURS!)Personally, I prefer a story.  I prefer something that makes sense and has a forward motion.  Something that adds up -- ALL of it.  I can go cerebral and make the challenging mental connections along with the best of them.  But SOLARIS and its breed (and their followers) believe that juxtaposing images in a random or lingering fashion -- as long as you have a thread of a story -- makes for some sort of artistic masterpiece.But it doesn't.There are some very nice elements in SOLARIS.  The concept, for one.  I haven't seen the original nor read the book (which shouldn't be required when seeing a film, by the way).  But the story concept is EXCELLENT.  I would have LOVED a well-told version of this thing.Jeremy Davies also gives a dynamic performance (hammy, perhaps, but at least it was fascinating to watch).  Clooney was solid.  McElhone was radiant. Davis was good.  I enjoyed the score and the aesthetically-pleasing cinematography and the expansive set.But when Soderbergh is at the helm of a story that DOESN'T have a clear linear drive (as BROCKOVICH and OCEAN'S both did), you get self-indulgent filmmaking, pure and simple.  TRAFFIC's another example.  Great to look at, excellent acting, nice scenes -- adds up to nothing we hadn't seen on a hundred television shows.  Maybe it's just me, but I find Soderbergh the most consistently overrated director working today (well, alongside Lynch, perhaps).The worst part is that I LOVED the IDEAS behind these films.  I would've liked each of those mentioned here to have been great WITHOUT having ME supply their meanings.  I just wish the filmmakers had done their jobs (tell a story), rather than pander to those few who find meaning where there is none.If that's you, then this is your film.",

You know when Chris (George Clooney) sees his wife for the first time he was shocked and afraid that he ships her off into space.  But when he sees her the second time I didn't even care since there was no suspense to build up to that climatic moment. The story is depressing but they could have added some dialogue and some more suspense to keep the audience wondering until the very end. Frankly, by the time the movie ended I didn't even care that happened to these two characters.  Another problem is the other crew members on the space station; we are introduced to them and nothing more.  They might as well not been there.  I guess Steven Soderbergh added them in to add some dialogue to the story.  At least make them interesting.

The films he make deal with fairly major issues; but seem to really effect the individual characters. Reminds me of Philip K Dick stories in a way. The story rolls out a wonderful pace, fragments of memory from various characters mixed in with visuals of the planet. Did anyone else see the strands across Solaris' surface? Reminded me of brain synapses...in the original one Russian character says something like 'the planet acts like a mind' or something like that. A lovely take on those lines I think. The acting is superb; Clooney is excellent. Who is the 'hairy' guy, who's been 'copied'? I can't remember his name, but he was in another film which had Bono from U2 in it (something Millenium Hotel?). I really enjoyed the soundtrack, really great with the visuals.

This is pure sci-fi: take a wild concept - what if our memories of lost love ones could become real and take on their own lives? - and then follow the idea to its logical conclusion, as realistically as possible.Despite a slow start this film scores, largely because of the outstanding portrayals of its two central characters, Chris (Clooney) and Rheya (McElhone). Of the two, McElhone is the mesmerising heart of this film, delivering an understated but electrifying performance as a new being struggling to understand what she is, and struggling to negotiate strange memories of her pain-wracked relationship with Chris.The parallel stories of their relationship past and present play out beautifully and almost every scene delivers a thoroughly convincing emotional bombshell. And no, it isn't a chick flick. This is grown-up film-making. It feels a lot like a play - dominated by long conversations between the two main characters. But it never drags and never gets boring. On the contrary, it is totally gripping because it commands such belief in its characters and their situation.Hats off to George for a nuanced, heartfelt performance and for being enough of a professional to give over so much screen time to McElhone. There are long shots here of conversations between these two in which we see nothing of Clooney at all - just McElhone's extraordinarily beautiful, haunting face, studying her reactions as he speaks. And it works. This film will stay with you for days.Highlight: Clooney's anguish when he discovers that Rheya has aborted their child (paralleled at the end when Rheya discovers that he killed her first \"copy\") - a powerful scene and the kind of acting you rarely see in Hollywood movies.

The script is often stupid/awkward, but sometimes poetic (in a good way). The characters aren't introduced much, and seem unfamiliar and hard to associate with. The movie generally doesn't evoke much emotion, except a few times, mostly because it so often induces disbelief. Certain camera shots (like seeing a character's face) feel unnecessarily long without adding substance, and at the same time, some story aspects are underdeveloped. There is no explanation for how clones of specific dead humans, with their memories, appear out of nowhere. The crew members are certain, by unknown reasons, that it's the planet below that creates them. Of course. And they are not unusually perplexed, amazed or in disbelief. The whole movie feels shallow because of this unrealism. It would have been potentially interesting to learn more about the planet Solaris.Also, more could have been done out of the main character's approach to Solaris. More emotion.At one point the characters discuss how the \"visitors\" are built. One of the crew members comes up with what is supposed to be a wild guess, the other one programs a particle accelerator (how come they have one on the ship to begin with?) based on that guess, and it just happens to be correct. And again, no questions asked and no explanations. There are multiple such ignored bits in this movie.The mentioned physics is bad too. Bosons do not have anti-particles, and the Higgs field gives *everything* mass, and exists everywhere. Although the Higgs was not yet experimentally confirmed by the time this movie was made, this has been theorised for some time. It would only take a simple internet search.However, the movie has some good aspects too. The visuals are beautiful. There is some really aesthetic lightning and scenery. The planet Solaris looks fascinating, and there are some nice shots of it. There are a few good story elements about love and regret, and the occasional emotional atmosphere. Background music is fitting.",

At times the dialog is so rich with different ideas that you need to rewind a few times to simply hear it all. Thus the Tarkovsky's version would not work for general audiences - it requires too much commitment from the viewer.  I saw it in the 70s, people were walking out of the theater - just as expected.Soderbergh knows all that and makes everything humanly possible to adjust the movie to the general public's tastes.  He focuses on the most fundamental ideas.  He sticks to the tightest, most straightforward storyline.  He cuts the movie himself with the precision of Eric Clapton's guitar.  He also knows that he will lose audiences if he fails to entertain them all the time, so he casts two undisputedly beautiful actors: Clooney and Natascha McElhone, augments the couple with a wonderfully funny sidekick (Jeremy Davies). He turns every frame into a glamor shot, adds romantic love scenes (with nudity, mind you), a state-of-the-art sci-fi soundtrack and elaborate computer graphics... and still people walk out of the theater.

This is, unfortunately, the exact same attitude that expelled Stanslaw Lem from the Science Fiction Writers of America in 1976.The main problem is the film is, it should not have received a wide-screen release, but should have been reserved for release to the art-houses. I fear Clooney's star-power or the fact that James Cameron produced the picture may have prevented the film from being released to a more suitable audience. The main-stream American audience is not going to \"get\" the point of the film; because of the subtlety of the script, it requires more attention than the average fan-boy is used to spending.This is also a good example of what C.S. Lewis called \"true science fiction\", in that the science of the situation is necessary for the sequence of events to occur. There is no way for Chris to re-live his past mistakes with Rheya unless she shows up for him to interact with her.\nAnother problem most viewers may find with the film is that it is character driven. This is difficult for many American audiences to take (coming from a goal-oriented society) and few have the patience or constitution to try and find out more about a character. Plots are much easier to digest.It's a beautiful film, well photographed and stunningly directed. The performances are strong, but handle what would have been a difficult script for lesser actors. The sets are breath taking and the costuming is detailed without being ridiculous.I'm only sorry it was set before the wrong audience.

He makes Chris Kelvin a burned-out shrink, rather than a scientist or \"accountant,\"allowing George Clooney wide range for his emotional response to the...\"occurrences\" ... he finds on the Solaris station.  Jeremy Davies is, as always, amazing, and gives his version of Dr. Snow twists that bring the general tension and surrealism of the original novel to palpable cinematic clarity.  And, they've even managed to eke viable plot out of  Lem's otherwise philosophical tract by re-drawing the third character as Helen Gordon, a obsessed physicist,constructed with diabolical focus by Viola Davis, who's driving force is to see that \"Humanity wins.\"  The three ingredients, emotion, surrealism and a mission, transform the abstract elements of the novel and original film into one of the most intelligent sci fi films since 2001.

I even thought the last image of the film looked amazingly like the red light of Hal.Take the plot summary on imdb :\"Upon arrival at the space station orbiting an ocean world called Solaris a psychologist discovers that the commander of an expedition to the planet has died mysteriously... \"Not once did they mention an expedition to the planet. They floated around this big glowing orb, looked like a star. Died mysteriously? The first thing they said is he committed suicide, this is never questioned. Where's the mystery?So somehow between filming and release the story got confused, the end result is just as confused.Looking at online reviews it appears it received some praise from those who saw it before the official release.

This is a common theme in Soviet era movies, for example the Russian made movie Stalker in 1979 is a quest to find a place in \"The Zone\" where you could basically get your wishes granted. Considering the bland lives of living in the Soviet union during that era, it's no wonder movies like this made such an impression on those people.The point of the movie is that if you could have your dreams, would you forgo reality and choose the dreams?

Everything - visuals, music, atmosphere, acting (especially Clooney) were top notch. I've always thought he was a decent actor but this for me was by far a career best. Ok there was some unnecessary shots of his butt but who cares? Even my girlfriend, not the deepest thinker that's ever lived, confessed that she'd enjoyed it. Reading some of the user comments I gather this film bombed in America, which doesn't surprise me. If it's not a film involving gung-ho heroes killing every baddie in sight or a film where they re-write history to suit themselves - see U571 or The Patriot - they really don't want to know (my apologies to the half of America which has a brain, and I suspect there ARE a few of you!).

I heard the original movie was 5 hours long. Most of you will be relieved to know that it's only 99 minutes... Some of you will be horrified to know that it feels *every bit that long and then some*.This is not a plot-driven story... It kind of gives a body to the, \"it's not the destination it's the journey\" addage. All in all, this is a film simply exploring ideas and notions. The whole sci-fi surrounding is just a catalyst to give the topics the jumpingboard they need.As near as I can tell, there are about 2 different sides when it comes to this movie, portrayed here, by the actual conversation with my father at the movie's conclusion:Me: I think solaris is a metaphor of God.

What happens when such a person is unexpectedly confronted with with an intelligence far superior to his own? An intelligence that (inadvertently?) shows you just how insignificant you are by effortlessly creating physical replicas of people from your own memories? Now the real confusion sets in. The person that appears out of nowhere just happens to be your dead wife. Flashbacks/dreams tell the story of love, depression, suicide and regret. What the other comments fail to mention is how lively the character is in these dream sequences as the romance blossoms. The disconnected character portrayed is not bad acting - it is good acting for a character whose lover had recently made good on her threat to kill herself.What is Solaris? Is it a heavenly messenger from which God issues second chances? This is the most pleasant conclusion and one which the emotional doctor embraces. The scene in which the duplicate wife explains her confusion about her situation - having memories but no feeling associated with them - is pretty haunting. These disturbing scenes just escalate - he tries to calm her with pills, then plans for a return to Earth. She is suicidal because: (1) his memories are of a suicidal wife, and (2) her awareness of her \"situation\" drives her mad. After some disturbing scenes, she is successful in her suicide attempt. The now more rational doctor is convinced by the other \"real\" person on the station that Solaris must be some malevolent alien intelligence and Earth must be warned. Are its intentions really bad? Or does it just not understand the consequences of its actions to humans? This idea doesn't comfort me at all. We are used to being the masters of our universe, with every frontier to be conquered eventually. What if we are doomed forever to continued suffering at the hands of unknowable forces?Anyway, interesting flick. I applaud the artistic and philosophical effort.",

Although I respected it for the vision and style, I was not able to really feel a part of it.  Maybe because of the subtitles, or because its pace is more designed for a European sensibility, I found myself drifting away from it many times.  Clooney's Solaris, with its quiet feeling also allows me to drift, but pulls me in and holds me there.When a movie or book is able to envelop me in its dream, and actually hold me there long after the end, it has accomplished its goal.  Solaris held its pull on me long after the last view of the planet disappeared from my screen.  I was left with that dreamlike feeling and mood for a long time afterwards.

Not for stylistic reasons, but simply the overall detached tone seemed to be very similar.  This movie is an example of Soderbergh's incredible ability to imply things very subtly.  Half the plot is hinted at through flashbacks, and for those people who like to think, a lot is told in so little time. This movie makes no attempt to explain the science fiction it incorporates.  Rather, it spends its short time explaining the psychology of the humans and Solaris.  People going in expecting a sci-fi will be greatly disappointed if they are expecting realism; this is a psychological movie, and explains that well. My favorite line was the last part, where George Clooney asks, \"Am I alive, or dead?\"  It doesn't matter, because if he believes he is happy, then it is of no consequence whether or not he is dead.  This is how the entire movie is; even we do not know whether he is actually at Earth and dreaming, or still in Solaris.  It is an exploration of the human mind, and how it reacts.

I had seen the Russian original a couple of months ago (didn't even know about this one, until I saw an ad on TV a couple of weeks ago), so perhaps that helps we with some background knowledge of the story to begin with.  I didn't understand the Russian version though, maybe because I accidentally watched the second tape before the first one.  I thought the story was much clearer in this movie, probably because it was in English, and was a modern production.  I remember thinking how quiet the movie was, but that it was good, because so many modern movies rely so heavily on music and action to capture the short attention span of the general public. It would be great to see a good movie with no action and no music helping it along. If someone doesn't like the movie because they don't understand it, that's a shame, because it is a wonderful movie, and gave me an emotional hangover as I was leaving the theater.",

The last scene in the novel is pretty cool too...The movie is almost entirely devoted to the love story (sub-plot), which is nicely done, with good acting by the cast.If you like 2001:A Space Odyssey (many references in the movie), are a Soderbergh fan, or like \"atmospheric\" movies, you will like this one.",

            "review_title": "For Art's Sake",
            "content": "For those looking for Star Wars or Men in Black, this movie is not for you. The classification of `Science Fiction/Thriller' is somewhat misleading. While it is science fiction, the film is much too cerebral to be called a `thriller.'  In truth, this film is more a testament to the power Soderbergh has in Hollywood than anything else.  It's not that the film is bad, but it certainly is not `major world wide release' material.  This is both a critique and a compliment for the film.  On the one hand, the movie going public could do with more challenging films, movies that it takes a few post viewing hours to wrap your mind around.  On the other hand, presenting a movie this inaccessible to the general public runs the risk of a financial and professional failing.  Thus, that Soderbergh could make it and release it during the Christmas movie season speaks volumes about how much pull he has (and justifiably so) in the industry.As for the movie itself, as with all Soderbergh films it is exceptionally well crafted (Traffic is, in my opinion, the most finely crafted film made in the last 20 years).  Fans of Soderbergh will not be disappointed by either the visual or atmospheric elements he brings to bear.  That begs the question whether visual and artistic merit are sufficient criteria with which to judge a film.  The answer is; it depends.  In a film such as Ron Fircke's Baraka, where there is no dialogue and there are no (specific) characters, the thematic elements can only be conveyed through visual and audio images.  Therefore, visual and artistic merit are the only criteria you can use to judge the film, and that suffices.  However, in a traditional film with characters, dialogue and action there is an expectation for thematic cohesion that Solaris seems to lack.  Because the ideas are vague and the plot non-linier, very few people will come out of this movie with a strong sense of what actually happened and what it all meant.  On the surface, that seems like not such a bad thing.  Strong art (and despite its wide release this is undoubtedly an `art film') should leave you thinking, discussing and wondering.  The problem is that if you are unable to come to any cohesive, arguable conclusions after you have done the thinking and discussing, the value of the film comes into question.  If the only value of a film that includes dialogue, character and action is for the visual and atmospheric quality, why should the former be included?\nAll of this is to say that we cannot simply be impressed with Soderbergh's camera work and call the film good.  Nor is it enough to say, `Wow, that film really made me think, it must be good.'  Rather, the director and writers should use the medium they employ to convey a message, and at some level that message must be obtainable by the audience they are trying to communicate with.  If the film, even after it has been discussed and analyzed by discerning minds continues to be incoherent, it has failed in to communicate and thus failed completely.The unavoidable comparison with Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey illustrates this point.  I first saw 2001 when I was twelve and I'm not sure what was more confusing, the movie or why I had watched the whole thing.  I had no idea whatsoever about what the film could mean.  However, I sat down with my father afterward and he pointed out some of the ideas and meaning.  Ideas such as that the film showed the progression of man from beast to human to whatever enlightened being Dave becomes at the end of 2001.  He showed me how the obelisk was either a catalyst for or a representation of these huge leaps in humanities advancements.  As our discussion progressed, the ideas of the film fell from confused images to a cohesive theme.  Certainly not one that was easily accessible or capable of being grasped without thought or effort, but after the effort was applied I knew, even at a young age, what was being communicated to me.  In short, the director and writer had connected.  The power of that moment stays with me even years later. Solaris, unfortunately, never lets the viewer (no matter how discerning) make that discovery or that connection.  You are left convinced that the film had something to say but despairing that you will never know what it was.  There is an overall lack of internal consistency so at no point can you track enough evidences to a defendable conclusion.  It's not so much that there are inconsistencies, but that you don't have enough evidence to support any particular idea convincingly.  It is the worst kind of argument: one with neither a conclusion nor enough evidence to support a conclusion.\nSome will argue that that is precisely the nature of the film.  The fact that there is no solid answer is not only justifiable but also desirable. For that argument to be true, however, we must accept that the film either does not give us enough information or the information is contradictory. If that is the case, it lacks the fundamental aspect that makes science fiction believable, internal consistency.  The viewer is left with only confusion and chaos, neither of which justifies the medium used to present, nor the time taken to view, the material.If you appreciate the visual and atmospheric elements in film this movie is worth watching.  If you are going for the plot or themes you will likely be disappointed.  There is a subset of viewers out there who will completely enjoy this film for its existential elements and unanswerable questions. However, for those who might be tempted to see this film because they anticipate some form of intellectual edification, just rent 2001 and call my dad with any questions you might have about it.",

Steven Soderbergh, a top grade film-director is not strong and experienced in SciFi. Ridley Scott, for example, would do better job I suppose, however I respect the work of Mr Soderbergh as well.

Dont know how the in-theater trailer for this movie was like, but the marketing people deserved to be fired for their misrepresentation.  The mood the trailer presented was that of a scifi thriller/action.  And that is NOT what this movie is.  This is a romantic movie with some philosophy in it.  It's a shame that it was misrepresented and therefore the audience walked in with the wrong expectation.  Or maybe the wrong type of audience walked in.\nThat being said, i think this movie is one of the better ones of 2002. There are just so many trashes and garbage out there.  I am disappointed that this movie didn't do well.  I will at some point rent the Russian ver and see for myself how this one compares.  Personally I think that the acting is not bad.  It is a departure from the too common nowaday loud talking good for nothings.  This film does require you to think, maybe not as deep as 2001, but you have to think some.  Anyway, i don't think that a direct comparison of this film to 2001 is valid.\nThe cinematics is not bad.  It has a lot of visual appearance.  But the movie is not really about special effects anyway.  So those who try to judge it by comparing the special effects to Star Wars, etc will of course be disappointed.Last but not least is the thinking part of the movie.  I haven't seen the Russian ver or read the book so i dont know how much more/less the movie thinks for the audience, but i enjoyed the fact that the movie does leave some thinkings for the audience at the end.  Maybe not as much as some other movies, but still this is better than most spoon feed movies nowaday.  If this is a contest for deep thought, 2001 probably win since it is somewhat more abstract, but like i said, this movie is not supposed to be a work known for its abstractness.With all that said, I would highly recommend this movie for those weekend romantic movie/popcorn session.

Indirecly the film addresses what it is to be human, the nature of memory, the possibility of life after death, and the question of what makes an individual. It does these things in a subtle way, letting the questions arise as the film develops. Answers are offered, but obliquely, perhaps more as suggestions.The film itself is, I think, well made. I thought the music was beautiful, and the performances understated but effective. I liked the fact that this was not a science fiction film, despite being set in space, the setting being paradoxically naturalistic ( as much as a man made structure can be ).If you're after an million mile an hour rampage through the galaxy with heroes, villains and a climax then you won't like this. If that's what you're expecting you'll be disappointed. If you would like to see a reflective film rich in ambiguity then you will come out feeling you have had a very satisfying evening.I haven't seen the original. As it's held to be a masterpiece I suspect it may surpass this version.

I have not met many people who thought it was just \"ok\".First of all, this movie has one of the best and most original soundtracks you will ever hear. It rivals that of Fight Club. It flows perfectly with the very cool and mesmerizing visuals throughout the movie. The story is very simple yet deep. There is even a nice little twist that brought a smile to my face. The normal witty and \"to cool for school\" persona that Clooney normally brings to the table is put aside for this film. Instead you find a troubled, depressed, and weak minded Dr. Kelvin which is played very well. I won't divulge into the story in hopes that if you have yet to see it, you go into it with an open mind.I can't say enough about this film. Even though I felt sad during the movie for the unfortunate Dr. Kelvin, I left the movie feeling happy and satisfied. Nothing feels left on the table, yet it leaves a bit to the imagination. My only negative is that I felt like it could have been longer. Solid 9/10.",

The acting was great, the direction was good, some really beautiful shots, however, it sort of missed the point of what the story was trying to say. A bit TOO heavy on the romance between Kelvin and Rheya and not enough attention paid to the philosophical questions raised. Reading some of the other reviews, I'm not sure how many people were aware this was a remake. Tarkosvky's version stands just fine by itself, and it's great to see a big Hollywood director taking a risk on such a story, but there really was no point. Also, Jeremy Davies is an excellent actor, but he really overdid it.Best of all Cliff Martinez's score is AMAZING. 5/10, just go watch the original.",

Soderbergh combines a love story with a space mystery, and brings his usual attention to the nuances of humans and their relationships to a larger, or at least more profound, stage - in orbit around a god-like planet that can shift reality by interpreting dreams and desires. It is a near-perfect match of science fiction and mature drama. Expect to see another film like it sometime after hell freezes over.",

And in my opinion did a much better job entertaining the majority of the people that watched it and tackling the same religion/philosophy questions as Solaris.I don't see a light bulb between two pieces of bread as art and I don't think Solaris should be either.The movie was too slow. They could have wrapped up the most important stuff in the movie with a 10 minute short.I felt like I was watching whats his name that directed Signs,6th Sense,..ect. Show someone get out of bed in real time. Cut away and show them getting a glass or water and drinking it all...then staring of into space like in deep thought for 30 seconds. Next show them sitting in a chair in another trance with no dialog or flashbacks.Stuff like that.Yeah, this type of filming helps develope the character..to some degree, but in Solaris it just felt like it was a huge timesink.I do like Clooney and the people who made this film. But I didn't feel like I was entertained after watching the movie. It was worth watching once, but I don't really get the people that say this was a great movie.I wasn't sipping 30 year old Bourban while I watched it and I don't look at half attempted ripoffs with a bigger budget than the rest as art.Like I said its been done before many times.",

When psychologist Chris Kelvin (George Clooney) is asked to visit a space station orbiting Solaris to investigate vague reports of mysterious incidents, he discovers a nightmarish scenario that could threaten the existence of humanity.  It's a movie filled with fascinating scenarios and themes, a great performance from Jeremy Davies as one of the afflicted inhabitants of the space station, some solid special effects, and effective cinematography.

Its a bit of a slow burner of a film but its certainly not a bad one. I liked that the background music/sound effects weren't too loud and 'in your face' and I thought the dialogue was quite good at times, although it can't be said that there's constant dialogue as some times scenes pass without long and convoluted discussions. One thing I found a little frustrating was that in some scenes, the dialogue was quite quiet, with characters talking in hushed tones - this may be an issue for people who are hard of hearing. This film has a somewhat philosophical side to it, which I quite liked. The focus on a lack of memory intrigued me. Also, some scenes feature relatively shaky/jerky camerawork, which might frustrate some viewers.\n\nThis is definitely more of an arty/'deep' philosophical film than anything else and so it may seem a bit pretentious to some but in any case, overall; yes, I would recommend this film as I personally found myself pretty engrossed in it.",

There are no traditional antagonists in this film; Chris' greatest enemy is a burden of conscience that he carries with him, the presence of which weighs down his soul and clouds his judgment. Initially, he doesn't believe his visitor is Rhea. Later, he no longer cares. The presence of someone who looks, feels, and sounds identical to his dead wife gives him an opportunity to assuage the pain of misplaced responsibility. The number of \"thinking\" science fiction films is small, and most are produced on small budgets for start-up directors.

            "content": "I have yet to see the more acclaimed 1972 version. I have also never seen the 1968 made-for-television version, nor have I read the original novel. My sole experience with Solaris is the divisive 2002 version by Steven Soderbergh. That being said, what I found with the 2002 version is a beautiful, cerebral, emotionally-engaging, and melancholic exploration into loneliness, guilt, existentialism, the metaphysical, and so much more. When a space station goes silent near the planet, Solaris, therapist, Dr. Chris Kelvin is sent to investigate what happened based on a video recording sent by one of the crew members, asking him by name to come. Even a security team sent in before him never returned, so the trip is already looking uneasy. Upon arriving, he sees blood trails and very few signs of life. He finds two crew members - Snow, a strange and neurotic crew member, and Gordon, who is filled with paranoia and doesn't even want to come out of her room at first. The other crew members are dead, due to the unexplained phenomena that the crew are experiencing (Though, Dr. Kelvin does see a child, but is unable to catch him and talk to him). During his stay, Dr. Kelvin is awakened by his wife, Rheya, who thinks they are at home together. Dr. Kelvin is understandably taken aback by this...because she's dead. Dr. Kelvin's time on the ship becomes a time of emotional torment as old memories are awakened and as he and the surviving crew members try to figure out what exactly is going on around them...all while being trapped in the terrifying isolation of space. Solaris is a gripping, slow-building drama that really strikes a chord as Dr. Kelvin relives memories of his marriage to Rheya - the good times, the bad times, and the ugliest of times that resulted in tragedy. It becomes incredibly heartbreaking at times, but never in an overwrought way. Rather, the way it unfolds is shown to us in a more believable manner, making such scenes all the more crushing. What makes it worse is that whatever force that has taken the form of Rheya states that she only exists through his memories and how he remembers her, causing her torment as she experiences these things, trapping her in a never-ending existential nightmare. It's a film that ponders life with all of its ups and downs, as well as exploring the possibility of a higher power and forces beyond our control. I found it to be a superb film that had made me engaged from beginning to end. I wanted to know what was happening, I wanted to dissect the myriad themes, and I was also engaged emotionally, becoming invested in the turmoil of Dr. Kelvin's life. I think Solaris is one of the most underrated and best films of the 2000's. We need more sci-fi films like this.",

            "content": "Short Review:\n\nA near perfect blend of visual storytelling, atmosphere, performance and dialogue. Slow but sometimes unengaging, Solaris is a film which garners the attention of the viewer for much of its running time, and refuses to throw itself to genericisms. A wild, heartfelt and beautiful ride that slightly stumbles in terms of its sometimes choppy editing (I don't give a shit if it was intentional; the editing took me out of the immersion a few times throughout) and dull final act, which only picks itself up with ten minutes to go.\n\nElongated Review:\n\nMusic to set the tone\n\nThe azure brilliance glows glorious; it is blatantly made out to be otherworldly. It holds no life, nor anything that could sustain such. Instead, it cultivates, manipulates and destroys the lives of others that come to rest at the shores of its influence. It is an alien planet that truly possesses a form of higher intelligence; perhaps not the type that we as humans for thousands of years have estimated ethereal beings would be capable of, but a quantity of perception and intellect all the same. It is both mesmerising, seductive, but utterly dangerous. It has the ability to exploit our own emotions and use them against us for its own benefit. And whilst that benefit is unbeknownst to us, its effects are still very much noticeable and potent.\n\nWelcome to Solaris.\n\nSteven Soderbergh's sci-fi picture about the human condition in terms of its emotional boundaries, as well as otherworldly creatures and planets, our hypothesis', our desires, is a masterclass of ambiguity, patience and dedication. Solaris centres around a psychologist named Kris Kelvin, played by George Clooney, who is sent to a space station orbiting the enigmatic and peculiar planet Solaris, after a distress message is sent out from one of the passengers, a passenger who happens to be an associate and friend of Kelvin's. After he is sent up to the space station, he discovers strange doings performed by the inhabitants; they exhibit unexplained behavior that Kelvin himself can not fully decipher. It is not until he is subjected to the strange powers of Solaris himself that Kelvin becomes prey to the same condition. As his ability to be able to discern what is and isn't real deserts him, he becomes subject to erotic fantasies and dreams about his late wife, Rheya. Soon enough though, such fantasies escalate, and Kelvin's imagination may prove more realistic than it seems.\n\nSolaris starts on Earth, with cold and distant lighting beckoning us forth into this story of peril and personal destruction. Soderbergh explains little to us within the initial scenes, primarily utilizing visual cues to describe certain ideas about our protagonist, the world he calls home and Solaris. These initial scenes are cold and lifeless on purpose, any ounce of heart or warmth long departed. There is a texture to Earth, thanks to the rain displayed (one of the opening shots is somewhat reminiscent to my favourite take from Seven, which features a mood-setting and dark heavy rainfall), but that does not necessarily evoke any sense of life. The extras are nearly all faceless and distant from the central character; even when Kelvin interacts with them and the minor characters, we don't see their faces. We hear their voices, see their bodies and watch their movements, but we never properly see their faces. We are alone with our detached psychologist, detached for reasons unknown at this point in time, and Soderbergh evokes this as much as he possibly can. It's gripping work, and immediately sets the tone for the rest of the picture.\n\nKelvin receives a message from his scientist colleague and friend Dr. Gibarian. Gibarian implores Kelvin to come to Solaris to witness the manifestation of a strange power; one that is weakening the mental endurance of all those on the space station orbiting the planet. As a psychologist, Kelvin is qualified for the situation at hand, and is requested by envoys of the corporation who own the space station to trek out and convince the crew members to abandon the mission and return to Earth; all members of the mission had been reluctant to leave prior to this point. This entire scene that features Kelvin receiving the distress message contains a slow and begrudging atmosphere, the message from Gibarian long and drawn out with few cuts throughout. There is no score over the top, nor is there any overtly dramatic lighting cues. Gaffer James Plannette delivers a cold orange colour for the set, and it feels hostile and unwelcome. All throughout the scene, the camera lingers on Kelvin, his every movement and emotion accented with the long takes utilized. Soderbergh undertook both the editing and cinematography roles, and his work here is exceptional. He doesn't cut away, nor does he seek to add flair to the visuals. There is a keen simplicity to the scene that articulates Clooney's performance; a performance which understates the residual and underlying emotional complications that exist within his being. At this point in time, we do not know why he is the way he is. Only time shall tell.\n\nWith Cliff Martinez's surprisingly versatile score blaring over the top, thematic inclusions abound, the film instigates the central plot, Kelvin heading off to Solaris. The film doesn't waste much time with unnecessary reflections, but instead simply cuts to Kelvin's ship approaching the space station that orbits the clear and bewildering planet below. It is a beautiful sight, and whilst rendered not as realistically as other planets depicted in films in the past, takes on a more transcendental quality. It feels spiritual and wholly otherworldly. As Kelvin draws closer to his target, the slow tone and visual splendour evoke comparisons to Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. As of so far, Solaris is entirely enthralling. Kelvin enters the space station shortly after, and finds himself alone amongst the sterile and antagonistic corridors of his directive. Within these scenes, Soderbergh and Martinez resist the urge to build anticipation with a predictable score that ostinatos and performs volume fluctuations for cheap gasps. The director wishes to capture a vibe and mood as Kelvin takes his first steps around the new location, and he achieves as such. It is both gripping and engrossing watching our protagonist traverse the unknown predicament, his lack of knowledge about the situation echoing our own.\n\nThe sound design is hollow and lacking personality. Everything sounds metallic and lacks human quality. The framing becomes wider and even yet more distant. As Kelvin explores, he comes across a child walking around the space station. He attempts to capture the youngling, but to no avail. Questions arise in our head, but the film refuses to acknowledge them. It will get to them in due time. Instead, we are met with our first major supporting character; a crew member named Snow, played by Jeremy Davies. There is something promptly strange about Snow. Davies fidgets with his surroundings and moves his body in strange and inhuman ways, and it is immediately off-putting. The screenplay echoes the sentiment that his body gives us; that this character is not to be trusted, Snow's dialogue jumping around in an indecipherable form that leads to more questions than answers. Kelvin's lack of emotion is still evidently unpleasant, but his distance feels more at home here more than ever. Alongside Snow, they make a strong team, their minimal individual personalities and uninviting dialogue blending together to form a very strange but reassuring chemistry.\n\nSnow points Kelvin towards an emotionally distraught female crew member named Dr. Gordon, played by Viola Davis. She is more spiteful to both the situation and Kelvin, and provides him few answers as to why the rest of the crew part Snow and herself, including Dr. Gibarian, are either dead or unaccounted for. Soderbergh paints Gordon in a light that makes her seem more fragile and malevolent than Snow, despite the fact that she is revealed later on to be of a more stable, intelligent mind (supposedly) than him, and containing of more logical thoughts and answers than anyone else on board. It's this effect instigated by the powers of Solaris; the ability to provoke an emotional dissonance between individuals, and even themselves, that unsettles and disfigures our ability to quantify and calculate the underemphasized competence of the antagonistic planet.\n\nDespite all the strange and inconclusive answers provided by the two remaining crew members as to what occurred to their fellow men and women, as well as themselves, there is never a building force that allows us to anticipate any conflicts or issues. The first concern that arises, part the fact that the two crew members sound and act half-mad, is evoked after Kelvin goes to bed. He dreams about a beautiful, stunning lady. She is staring at him, and he is staring back. The size and distance of the frame that accompanies the scenes that are shot within the space station is replaced with a frame that features lesser aperture. The focal length is increased, and we are gifted with a far more intimate palette of visuals, something that proves more aesthetically pleasing on a fundamental level. We witness Kelvin smiling; a first in the film. The subsequent scene reveals to us the identity of the woman, thanks to the aforementioned Gibarian; Rheya. She brings out a warmth in Kelvin that is most appreciated, and their following love scenes show a tenderness in the protagonist that has been unprovoked prior.\n\nAll seems well and good, until Rheya appears in the space station. Flashing in and out of the supposed dream-sequences, we witness two intertwining sex scenes; one occurring inside Kelvin's mind, and the other happening above Solaris, in modern times. Perhaps these are intertwining dream sequences, one is prone to questioning. Such an argument is proven meaningless when Kelvin awakes to find Rhaeya beside him. His confusion is obvious, and we finally get a proper answer to a question that we have possessed the entire time whilst on the space station; what truly are the effects of Solaris? Through subsequent scenes, we come to understand that Rheya is dead, and the cause of the perpetual depression that Kelvin resides within. He is emotionally distraught due to her harrowing suicide, caused after she terminated a pregnancy and was pushed away briefly by Kelvin. Soderbergh again allows his visuals to expand upon the relationship, their closeness and understanding of each other elaborated upon with scenes of love, heart and passion that contain few words.\n\nAt first, Kelvin knows his duty. He sends this fake Rheya off in an escape capsule, sending her out into the abyss of space to die. At this point, he can decipher between what's real and what isn't, and the audience is reassured by this. Soderbergh begins to explain himself, that this sudden and strange conflict is due to the powers of Solaris. He does such with visuals and dialogue between namely Snow and Kelvin. He uncovers the fact that Rheya will not stay dead, as she is a figment of his memories and personality that Solaris is evoking as a physical being. To what end does Solaris seek with this strategy, we are led to ask. The answer is not clear at any point throughout the film, and frustrates not only ourselves but our protagonists. They, along with us, desire meaning behind such an event, as otherwise they are unable to combat the threat. But little do they, or more so Kelvin, know that the planet looming beneath them can not be fought or contained; its powers are too great for one to even consider taming them. So Gordon establishes a plan to rid themselves of Rheya and the other beings created from memories (the other crew members have endured the same as our protagonist), and to flee to Earth. But Kelvin is suddenly hesitant to do so. Kelvin now has an opportunity to correct what he believes were misdeeds in his past, and so he is unwilling to leave his dead wife to the past.\n\nSoderbergh's cinematography continues to grow in size and distance, leaving us to feel as if the protagonists are being watched by something. Mayhaps it is the child that Kelvin attempted to capture as he arrived on the space station; the answer I'd prefer to side with would be that it is Solaris itself watching. This adds a whole new dimension to the drama, that leaves the titular planet feeling less like an antagonist, and more so reminiscent of a curious being that wishes to study the emotional ramifications that presenting a physical memory to a human would bring about. Suddenly, Solaris has personality. Meanwhile, the space station drifts closer to the planet, the gravitational field increasing supposedly as a response to the actions of the humans. A newly formed Rheya comes to understand the artificial nature of her existence, and wishes to be destroyed by a machine that Dr. Gordon has constructed. Kelvin, who wants to relive his better days and wishes to stay stuck in the past, does not desire Rheya to leave him to his own devices again, especially after the perilous and never-ending despondency he had to endure after her initial passing. But this artificial version of the real Rheya can not construct her own memories (for some reason, I find this comparable to the short-term memory loss suffered by Leonard in Christopher Nolan's Memento), and does not desire the opportunity to live. So Gordon destroys her whilst Kelvin sleeps, and gifts our protagonist the opportunity to leave the dreaded orbit. They discover that \"Snow\" is in fact the brother of the real Snow, and he himself is one of the constructs of Solaris' powers. This reveal leaves the two surviving, human astronauts no resolution but to leave immediately.\n\nAnd this is where the film stumbles for a portion. The film's climax was never intended to come as a rush, and whilst that is understandable, the fact that the film never feels like it's stepping up in stakes proves troublesome. The slow pace as the film hurtles towards the ending contradicts itself, and the audience member is lost for an extended period. Kelvin abandons the escape pod and Gordon, leaving himself to die as the space station sinks closer and closer to he dreaded surface of Solaris, the waves of pink grandeur consuming the ship. Gordon drifts outside the gravitational field, whilst Kelvin submits to his inevitable doom. The lure of Solaris has finally become too much for him, and he decides to stay. The addiction becomes too much of a burden though, as shortly after Gordon leaves, he loses his ability to stand, his weakness obvious.\n\nThe child from before appears, offering a hand to Kelvin. We cut suddenly to Earth. It appears as if our protagonist has miraculously made it back to home, but is struggling to return to normal functioning after the strange occurrences abroad. But this is not real, we soon understand; whereas in the beginning of the film we see Kelvin cut himself and deal with the injury over time, he cuts himself during this period but the injury instantaneously heals itself. So what has happened, we are led to ask. Is this Kelvin now a replica of the original Kelvin, living in a constructed, fanciful version of the real Kelvin's life, assembled by Solaris? Is this the real Kelvin, still alive thanks to the curiosity and power of the ethereal being he fell into?\n\nAll we know for sure is that Kelvin meets his wife, and Rheya exclaims that they can finally be together now, free of the past. They are now transcendent of the general definitions of life and death, and their future can be spent together infinitely, thanks to the power of Solaris. No longer do the two have to live according to the memories Kelvin had constructed with him and Rheya; he can finally make new ones, and bring about a whole new life for them. But what is the value of that relationship continuing in such a context as this? Is this relationship actually occurring in reality, or is Solaris so curious about the human condition and our emotional attachments that it may even be recreating the relationship, to study and observe it?\n\nAll acceptable questions; some more so than others. What I can say for sure that is definite, is that Solaris is an exceptional picture. It reflects on the power of memories, our individual relationships, and the detriment that living in the past can cause. Soderbergh is unafraid to prod at emotional and moral conflicts, and what results is a film that is utterly sensational in its dedication to tone, themes and message. It's not perfect; the final act, as I mentioned, features numerous periods of stale film that doesn't really click perfectly. It finds its footing again in the final ten minutes, but for a good period, there is little to fully grip the audience member. That, and there are a number of disjointed pieces of editing, perhaps caused by the fact that Soderbergh himself took on such a role. Whether these were intentional or not, I do not care; they broke immersion, and proved irritating. That said, Solaris still contains enough technical wizardry and passion to be considered an absolutely commendable piece of entertainment. It even features an actually impressive score from Cliff Martinez; a man whose recent work could be considered less than acceptable. His humming and droning is sacrificed for a more melodic approach that achieves better, ethereal, stunning results. The same can be said for the majority of this film. This is a transcendent experience that has to be seen to be believed. It is lavish, beautiful, gripping for much of its duration, and contains strong performances and tight cinematography all throughout. Soderbergh's meticulous vision and auteur style dictates that Solaris is undeniably a triumph throughout thick and thin.",

            "content": "This 2002 remake of Andrei Tarkovsky's Solaris manages to be far less ambitious and goes straight to the point. I thought it was a good take on the classic film, but it doesn't have the epic visuals and terrific, yet simple story that the original possessed. Of course, this film echoes what the 1976 film had, but it never goes in depth with its subject, and it doesn't do anything new or refreshing. With that being said, Watch the original film instead, it's far superior and it's a classic of the genre. This remake is good, but it never comes close to the original. The acting in this remake is very good, and I thought that overall it was a solid film, but it also rushed through the story a bit. With the original, it took its time to let the story unfold and it worked brilliantly and that's one of the main reasons that Tarkovsky's Sci Fi classic is so unique and ultimately memorable. With this remake, you get a far shorter film, one that doesn't reach its potential and in turn lacks the development that made the original so good. Nonetheless, this remake is good, but it could have been better as well. Luckily the cast are great, and it's the film's strongest asset. However, I would recommend the 1976 film instead of this one, but if you want a more stripped down version, with less ambitious ideas, then this remake is for you.  In terms of revamping a classic film, Solaris like every other remake before or after it has left a bit to be desired, and makes you want to watch the original film. The ideas expressed on-screen, are things we've seen before, and there never is new blood injected into the story. For a remake however, it's quite good, but it's nothing compared to the film that came before it.",

This is a slow, meditative sci-fi drama which tries to be as deep and philosophical as 2001: A Space Odyssey, but it feels rushed and it leaves everything up in the air with more questions than answers. Dr. Chris Kelvin (George Clooney) is a haunted man, mourning the loss of his wife Rheya (Natascha McElhone). He accepts a mission by his friend Dr. Gibarian (Ulrich Tukur) to the space station Solaris, which is orbiting the distant planet of the same name. When Kelvin arrives, he finds most of the crew are dead or have vanished under mysterious circumstances, and Gibarian has died, and the two surviving crew members Dr. Gordon (Viola Davis) and Snow (Jeremy Davies) don't want to say what happened. However, when Kelvin goes to sleep, he's haunted by dreams of Rheya, then he wakes up to discover that she's really there. It's a film which tries to be smart and philosophical, but it's trying too hard, and it ends up being a lot less cleverer than it thinks it is. The film is essentially a chamber piece, which should have been a doddle for Soderbergh, but it comes across as being more dull than informative, but there are some good performances.",

Soderbergh's success has always been with people, people and their relationships. They are always very real and this has always been what drives my appreciation of his films.

We can figure out what is going on before we're told, but that doesn't take away from what's happening on screen at all. In fact, it then raises all the philosophical and metaphysical, moral questions one must ask. When a movie makes you think this much about ideas, I always find that to be a great sign.  I definitely want to see the original now, but I think this stands as a very interesting piece on it's own merits. Well worth a watch if you like topics like life/death/afterlife, love, what you would do for one more chance, non-human intelligence, and so forth. I think the focus on Chris (Clooney) and his love for his wife (McElhone) is a great addition to the plot and really acts as a cornerstone, along with Solaris (the planet) through which to examine the deep philosophical ideas.

            "content": "Though I never had the slightest belief that a second cinematic adaptation of Solaris could transcend the success of Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 adaptation, with Steven Soderbergh as director and George Clooney as the star I figured it couldn't be too bad.\n\nAlthough Solaris will undoubtedly draw comparisons to Andrei Tarkovsky's unbeatable adaptation of the text, Steven Soderbergh respectively makes the decision to focus his efforts on creating his own adaptation of the text rather than a remake. His adaptation is his own work and does not try to be anything else. \nSteven Soderbergh's adaptation of Solaris puts the focus on the relationship between the two main characters as it is essentially the heart of the tale. Unfortunately, it gets so caught up in doing so that it ends up ignoring a lot of the more complicated science fiction and psychological plot points that Andrei Tarkovsky's version touched upon. The visual effects and production design of the film do an impressive job of conveying the nature of the setting, but the central point of Solaris is that it is a science fiction concept for the mind and not for the eyes. Andrei Tarkovsky's adaptation only touched upon the concepts of the titular planet lightly to the disappointment to the author of the original text Stanislaw Lem, but Steven Soderbergh's does it even less. There is no sight of the supposed ocean that is the planet, and so the film really neglects its potential to expand upon what the author would have wanted, and it lacks enough psychological elements to stand up too high. Instead of focusing on the melancholic emptiness of being in space, Solaris constantly reminds viewers that the protagonist has constant human contact with the other character Doctor Gordon. Since the film has less running time than the original and limits its material to a mere 99 minutes of cinema, the movement of everything is a lot quicker and so the sense of emptiness is not felt, except for in the limited exploration of the material that Steven Soderbergh puts into the film. While Solaris has been criticized for its slow pace, it moves along at a quicker rate than Andrei Tarkovsky's adaptation, largely because among other things it only runs for around half the running time. I hardly felt that the pace of Solaris was anything but necessary because it once again worked to capture the intricate and humane nature of the premise. Unfortunately, there is just not enough of it. Frankly, Solaris is a stylish adaptation of its text, and I may not be the perfect person to critique it as I have never read the novel itself but I was very fond of the complex psychology presented in the 1972 adaptation which was not found in this version. Perhaps the adaptation feels a bit too contemporary and perhaps it is an unnecessary film as the ideologies and themes in the film were already proposed 30 years prior by Andrei Tarkovsky in a superior manner and by this point it just doesn't feel as intelligent. The screenplay itself maintains strong dialogue and there are some smart aspects to it, but it just feels all done before.\nBut even though there is not too much new to learn from Steven Soderbergh's adaptation of the classic text, he still handles the film gently. As well as ensuring that the language in the film is intelligent and the atmosphere of the film is emotionally atmospheric in a gentle fashion, Steven Soderbergh really has Solaris looking and sounding good. With the use of the aforementioned production design and visual effects as well as strong cinematography techniques, Solaris is a very good looking and detailed film which is thoroughly convincing which is illuminated further by the use of colourful lighting. The simple yet effective production design of Solaris manages to depict a not too distant futuristic setting. And the musical score of the film is also strong, even though it cannot compare to the work of Eduard Artemyev, Cliff Martinez manages to create an appropriate mix of emotional and science fiction mood for Solaris. The film is a treat on the eyes and the ears as well as the mind, though the third option is determined by whether or not the viewer has seen Andrei Tarkovsky's version.\nThe one area that Solaris actually succeeds at being better than the original is in the casting of its lead actor. George Clooney is perfect for the leading role of Dr. Chris Kelvin. In a performance which transcends the one given by Donatas Banionis in the original Solaris, George Clooney manages to approach his role in Solaris with a strong sense of emotional involvement in his role. Facing a complicated character but doing it with such humane dedication to the role, George Clooney manages to bring his role to life by convincing viewers that he truly understands the complicated concepts behind the narrative and then developing the character as he faces the emotionally complex nature of the narrative. George Clooney does not play his role as an archetype, he actively pours his heart and soul into the performance by slowly but surely exploring the emotional pain of his character and rendering audiences easily able to sympathise with him for all his suffering. He really puts a lot of depth into the role which single handily makes Solaris a very character driven feature, also meaning that his role in the film is one of the finest aspects of the production. George Clooney proves once again that he works well alongside Steven Soderbergh, and his leading performance is one of the much more sympathetic efforts of his career and potentially one of his finest.\n\nSo while the 2002 adaptation of Solaris lacks the originality, depth and flair of Andrei Tarkovsky's superior 1972 adaptation Steven Soderbergh's directorial work ensures that it is an intelligently written, emotionally gentle and stylish film which looks and feels good all while it is anchored by an extremely touching lead performance from George Clooney.",

The movie is purposefully deep, revolving around philosophical, spiritual, and moral ideas that can be felt in the movie's atmosphere. What is subtly annoying, however, minus the obvious philosophical idea to think about, is that these such philosophical/spiritual/moral ideas are never explicitly pointed at. There is no specific question in the dialogue that outlines the heaviness of the film-- you just know it is there as you watch. Perhaps some of that \"weightiness\" is felt by extended scenes with limited to no dialogue, focusing more on the scene or a specific image. Clooney's facial expressions take a slight spotlight in the movie (which is an acting trait he is adept in controlling/portraying) to show the turmoil and confusion of the events; you can almost feel the emotions themselves by watching his movements. Because the movie tries to \"dig deep\", the plot is straight forward to a fault: narrative dimension is replaced by Clooney and friends' struggling with reality. Disappointingly, there is only small context on \"Dr.\" Kelvin (Clooney)'s therapeutic background-- what is his experience? What are his usual procedures to dealing with these issues? How would he diagnose the situation, etc. Kelvin's backdrop seems like it would add a very intriguing part to the situation, but his profession is barely touched on at all. Another result of near-static-storytelling is the lack of a profound climax. The main event happens... and everything else compliments that drama without providing much more. Although the story continues to unravel, something about its presentation does not give much surprise-- almost as if you are subconsciously expecting the turn of events to happen (the exception being the movie's ending). Yet one more pestering element is the lack of annotation to Dr. Kelvin's thoughts. He does not offer much for you to know what he is thinking or what his thought-process is as he struggles; you find out tidbits here and there as he speaks to other crew members, but it is usually what you would expect him to be thinking, which narrows his character. Bottom line: this film is worth watching if you can persevere through low-intensity storytelling and if you can struggle, as Dr. Kelvin struggles, with the power and meaning of Solaris.",

No, I liked Tarkovsky's interpretation of this tale, but, seriously, ladies and gentlemen, I present to you a newer and slicker \"Solaris\", which you know has to be more exciting, seeing as how Steven Soderbergh is by no means known for making glacially slow films. Jokes aside, outside of the surprisingly kind of limp, but still decent third one, Soderbergh's \"Danny Ocean\" films are pretty fun, which, of course, gave me hope that I might find thorough entertainment value in this film, seeing as how it also stars George Clooney, and is about an \"ocean\" planet (Nyuk-nyuk-nyuk). Kidding aside, this is a romantic sci-fi drama that prominently features a planet made of ocean water, so are you really that surprised to find that James Cameron is at least producing this project? Well, to be honest, I was a little bit surprised to find that out, because this film is kind of cheap for a James Cameron production, and I will always remember that because as high profile as this film is, it still underperformed at the box office. Man, this baby lost $17 million at the box office, and I'd imagine that news made poor little Jimmy spit out his Shipwrecked 1907 Heidsieck champagne when he read about it while on the second round of his tri-annual personal cruise to the Bahamas. Well, Jim, my man, I can't entirely blame the people for not seeing this film, because while it is decent, it has plenty of problems.\r\n\r\nThe 1972 film which technically inspires this fellow adaptation of Stanis\u0142aw Lem's classic sci-fi novel had its share of unique areas, but also got to be kind of formulaic, and let me tell you, the conventionalism in this story has most certainly not died down in 30 years, thus this film is also left to hits its share of tropes that make it predictable, even if you're not familiar with other interpretations of Lem's story, and yet, while this film tells us a bit too much of what we already know, it stands to say more. I opened up this article cracking jokes about how this film is a whole lot shorter than its 1972 counterpart, and sure, this effort is pretty comfortably tight in plenty of places, but at just about 100 minutes, this film trims a bit too much fat around some of this story's edges, resulting in expository shortcomings, and certain areas of undercooking which leave depths to be delivered rather ambiguously. The film's subtle approach to thematic and dramatic weight sometimes work considerably, but on the whole, there's something kind of frustrating about this film's not taking as much time as it should to really flesh out its vision, and yet, wouldn't you know it, even though the film gets to be too tight for its own good, it still makes time for some dragging. Needless to say, this film isn't quite as draggy as its over two-and-a-half-hour-long counterpart of 1972, but its structure often boasts the arty attitude of Andrei Tarkovsky's \"Solaris\", complete with overlong meditations upon nothing but nothing, made all the more aggravating by those classic Steven Soderbergh cold spells in atmosphere, established through quietness, if not all-out silence, behind dry air. The film gets to be too arty for its own good, and I must admit that when artistry gets really overblown, there is a slight breeze of pretense to break up Steve Soderbergh's ambition, which is noble, sure, but misguided in some places, delivering on questionable directorial moves, when not emphasizing plotting's other shortcomings, both consequential and natural. Soderbergh wants this film to be more than what it is, and I most certainly subscribe to such a sentiment, but unlike Soderbergh, I can't say that this worthy vision is spotless, as Soderbergh gets kind of carried away at times with his thoughtfulness, yet cannot obscure the conventionalism and undercooking with an overly steady pace, thus leaving the final product to fall short, almost into mediocrity. Of course, mediocrity does not quite claim this one, because no matter how flawed this film may be, what it does right it does well enough to hold your attention, or at least your eyes' attention.\r\n\r\nThis is a very minimalist sci-fi film, so there's not a whole lot of room to dazzle, but man, production designer Philip Messina delivers the best that he can, tossing in some subtly distinguished details within the handful of moments outside of the \"Solaris Station\" - within which this story primarily takes place - in order to sell you on this futuristic world, while the broader sets, particularly the \"Solaris Station\" set, boast such intricacy that it's hard not to be drawn into this film's environment. The designs of the film are near-dazzling in their sharpness, though that might just be Steven Soderb-oh, I mean, \"Peter Andrews\", because even though this film's cinematography is not as playful with color palettes as many other films lensed by Soder-I mean, \"Andrews\", Andrews compensates with a heavy tone that is unique and rugged, as well as with sparse lighting which plays with darker areas in imagery in a tasteful way that is consistently beautiful, and sometimes stunning. As with plenty of films shot by Andr-oh, forget it-Soderbergh, this effort looks so gorgeous in a way that has to be seen in order to be truly believed, and Cliff Martinez's seriously underused, but tasteful score, - flavored up by hypnotic electronic touch-ups - isn't too shabby either, thus leaving the artistry of this film to stand as almost enough to carry the final product, whose decency is perhaps more firmly secured by acting that is about as tasteful as the artistry. There aren't too many people in this minimalist drama, and what talents you do see don't come accompanied with as much material as they probably should have, but there is strong acting here, and it can primarily be found within our leads, as Natascha McElhone, like Natalya Bondarchuk in the 1972 show that she stole, delivers on an intensity that captures the anguish of the Rheya Kelvin character, while George Clooney's subtle intense captures the uncertainty and other dramatic layers of a man trapped in a claustrophobic environment with a love who he had lost and has returned in the most peculiar of ways. The performances aren't written to be as outstanding as the film's artistry, but like the artistry, the acting is impossible to ignore as a strength which carries the film quite a distance, but cannot craft a truly decent drama alone. Storytelling is messy, and Stanis\u0142aw Lem's classic story concept is not weighty enough to handle too many blows from undercooking, bloating and overambition, but it is still reasonably worthy, with intriguing thematic depth that inspires a degree of immediate intrigue, reinforced by what is done right by Steven Soderbergh, as director, whose thoughtful storytelling has its share of controlled moments which effectively absorb thematic weight, and even dramatic weight, sometimes to an unexpectedly very moving degree that gives you a glimpse into what this very human and meditative drama could have been, and grows more recurring as the film goes along, until it all comes down to a pretty strong ending whose ambiguity genuinely works as thought-provoking. Were the film more fleshed out and more controlled in pacing, we would be seeing more of these highlights in storytelling and end up with a pretty rewarding film, but as things stand, effective moments break up consistent decency, which is more challenged than it should be by considerable storytelling issues, but ultimately reinforced enough by inspiration to stand firm, even if you do end up hoping for more than just decency.\r\n\r\nBottom line, the film has formulaic areas and undercooked areas, but is most dragged down by, well, dragging, achieved through aimlessly meditative moments, made all the more grating by atmospheric coldness that, with an air of overambition, distance your investment enough for you soak up the shortcomings that ultimately drive the final product to the brink of mediocrity, which is ultimately diverted by excellent production designs, gorgeous, if not breathtaking cinematography, strong performances by George Clooney and Natascha McElhone, and enough highlights in the thoughtful telling of an intriguing story for Steven Soderbergh's \"Solaris\" to stand as a decent sci-fi drama which could have been more, but still gets you by just fine.\r\n\r\n2.5/5 - Fair",

However, Solaris is a bit too much on the thought-provoking side - to the point it becomes boring and thought-numbing. George Clooney & Natascha McElhone give us emotionally intense performances but not enough to save the movie. Solaris tries to incorporate emotions, technology and the future all together to give you something in the likes of 2001-A Space Odyssey. But with one major flaw - it does not have the magic Stanley Kubrick had. \nOverall Rating - 5 out of 10\nLoy Machedo\nloymachedo.com | loymachedo.tv",

I don't want to guess what happens and why its happing this way . Don't get me wrong, please, I am a huge fanatic of psychological movies but in this case it's a NO a big one and the main reason is poor execution .",

That would be Tarkovsky's 1972 opus  also called Solaris. \n\nThat might be the grander, more important film, but this one is significantly shorter, and not quite as pretentious. It's still quite slow and quiet however. \n\nIt's a film big on ideas, and yes, while it does drag, it's a great mood piece. If you have insomnia, this or the '72 film would be great to put on. That's not quite a knock, either. \n\nPatience is key with appreciating this movie, but I think it's worth it, and Soderbergh is the perfect person for a remake like this. \n\nClooney is good, as you'd expect, and Viola Davis is decent, too. I also liked Jeremy Davies, whose \"out there\"-ness really brought a bit of levity, while also helping to get the mood right. \n\nThe plot could be a bit stronger, but overall, this is an alright film that fits somewhere in the upper middle of Soderbergh's oeuvre.",

While there, he gets a visit from his dead wife. Most of the story is spent explaining his relationship with his wife, but once you see what happened it turns into a struggle to stay with her, raising the questions \"is it ethical to be stay with someone if they're only a representation of someone you once loved?\" and \"is it possible to fall in love with someone if you, yourself never really knew them in the first place?\". It's really sleek and stylish, everything is silver and in shades of grey. It's a little misleading however, at the beginning it would seem that you're going to be in for a thrill ride, only to unveil a long drawn out drama...And I mean LONG. \r\n\r\nThe Cast: George Clooney, Natascha McElhone, Viola Davis, Jeremy Davies...George Clooney is Chris Kelvin, he's the man sent to the space station only to find that the planet it's orbiting is responsible for some strange activities on board the ship. Not his best performance, but it's a lot better than some of his other works *cough*Batman*cough*. Natascha McElhone is Rheya, Chris' former wife, and representation of his former wife. She gives a good performance as the understanding entity that only wants the best for Chris. I don't think I've ever seen any of her other roles, so this is by default the best performance I've ever seen from her. Viola Davis is Gordon, the tough, no nonsense woman that wants to end whatever it is that's going on, on board the station. A good performance, not as good as McElhone, but still a fairly solid act. Jeremy Davies, plays the part of Snow...Yeah, I don't know what the hell kind of name that is either, I mean really you have Chris, Rheya, Gordon, and then you have Snow...But odd choice of name aside, he's the quiet, smart guy on the ship. He knows and understands the problem better than most of the other characters. A good performance but a little typecast, if you watch him in Ravenous (I'll try to post that review sometime this month) you'll see him playing a near identical character only in a completely different time period and setting. \r\n\r\nOne to Five Scale: 2 \r\n\r\nA decent cast that can't quite compensate for a slow moving and boring story. \r\n\r\nTyler",

Clooney, on fine troubled form, plays Kelvin, a psychologist called to the outer reaches of space on a mission of mercy to help rescue a space crew who have become enraptured by the mysterious planet Solaris that they have been sent to observe. Once he joins the crew, Kelvin quickly realises that the planet is reacting to the study, and may well be doing some analysis of its own. As his memories take on a strange and haunting reality it becomes more and more difficult to keep focus on making the voyage home. Minimalist, hypnotic and disturbing, Soderberg nails the chilly and cerebral atmosphere and the sense of slowly losing grip on reality, and the beats are at first confusing and eventually moving and profoundly disturbing.

In this case, Andrei Tarkovsky's original \"Solaris\" is not only held by many as a masterpiece (myself included), but as well as one of the essentials of it's genre.  So Why remake a masterpiece? Well, achieving \"masterpiece\" status doesn't mean the film is perfect, as such a thing is impossible, in Solaris' case the film is obviously made on a budget, and is also an adaptation, meaning the work is simply the view of a single or a single group of individuals, some may love the picture, but want to do something different with the source material.  People seem to forget the 1968 TV adaptation of Solaris by a \"B. Nirenburg\", Tarkovsky himself obviously wasn't satisfied with that adaptation either.  Frankly, i love 2001: A Space Odyssey, but I really wish i could make a remake with flesh eating zombies in there as well...... :D\r\n\r\nSuch is obviously the case with Soderbergh's adaptation of Solaris.  As the film is much more streamlined, and seems to shift the narrative focus from general existentialism to a tale concerned with lost love.  Such a shift gives the picture it's own voice.  However, Soderbergh is obviously a huge fan of Tarkovsky's adaptation as well, as there are several visual nods to his work.  And this is where the picture misses the mark.\r\n\r\nThe picture is telling it's own story, yet is very heavily indebted to Tarkovsky's version.  The parallel's the comparison between the two draws hurts Soderbergh's version.  The plot is streamlined and more focused, but lacks the meat and phycological punch of it's predecessor.  It seems it would have been wiser to make an entirely different version that doesn't reference the original at all.\r\n\r\nThat being said the film itself is kind of a gem in it's own right.  The slow pace at which the film unfolds appeals to the intelligence in the same way Tarkovsky's does, it's not a typical hollywood sci-fi adventure concerned more with the science than with the fiction.  The cinematography is dark, claustrophobic, with entire scenes of dialogue with characters' hidden in shadow, if nothing else, this film looks a thousand miles better than the low budget russian masterpiece.  \r\n\r\nThough it's narrative doesn't quite feel as satisfying as the Tarkovsky adaptation, the fact that the film has it's own voice combined with re-imagined images of the original, make Soderbergh's flawed Solaris a winner in my book.",

And while in her other movies I never gave Natasha McElhone another look, here she shines brightly. She is supremely beautiful, and sad, and disturbing. As she looks right out of the screen she's boring holes with her gorgeous eyes straight into your own, and there's no escape shy of shutting the TV off. She certainly does the job of being creepadelic.\r\nThe love story is worth chewing on as the credits scroll. Was it enough for Kelvin to love his memory and projection of Rheya, rather than Rheya herself? And what is really the difference between existence and perceived existence? If his dead (?) wife were aware that he was seeing \"her\" again and wanted another shot at the relationship they were meant to have, would she be happy? Or sadly repulsed? \r\nThere's also the matter of the \"planet\". I enjoy a good brain exercise, and here is brought the paradox of having it all figured out because you are aware that you do not, in fact, have it all figured out. Do you understand the situation when you are aware that you don't? \"I would tell you what's happening, but I'm not sure that would tell you what's happening.\" The storyteller's attempt to portray higher intelligence, and that we have no idea how to predict how such an One might treat us, is a worthy stab.\r\nThe ending is very fitting as well. Because, indeed, what in the world happened?\r\nI think I'm going to have to watch this a 3rd time before returning it to the library.

            "content": "Seems like the idea of being a remake( or rather reimagination ) of a masterpiece have affected few movies like it affected steven soderberg's  Solaris. While  Tarkovsky's solyaris and  soderberg's solaris both  shares Stanislaw Lem's novel as source material , it feels like both directors were inspired by the book to create something  truly cinematic  rather than just end up illustrating the text. \nOn Stanislaw Lem's has admitted in his  personal website, the true intention of the book was to to propound what an Encounter with something truly Alien might be like. But both Soderberg and  tarkovsky seems to have drawn in to the human drama attached to the work and movies works largely as psychological drama rather than a science fiction( which is more than often what true science aims to achieve). Soderberg's solaris is a self aware work of art, somewhat similar to works like begman's persona(I am not comparing the stylisitc aspects of the films here but the rather the overall effect). Inexplicable scenarios happens yet the audience and the movie accepts them without questions, because we are hooked more to the metaphors implied by the construct  rather than the construct itself.\n\nSolaris builds up a similar  form like many of the great works of scence fiction. It uses the liberties of a science fiction universe to conjure up  a situation completely alien to humanity and then introduces normal human beings into this world, testing their humanity, constantly questioning  aspects of our psyche that makes us human. The science fiction universe in solaris the movie is spent mostly in a spacecraft inspecting a planet named solaris.  Solaris differs from a normal planet in one aspect-It observes the minds of the humans close to it, finds what is it they have  lost or missed most  and materializes  the loss back to them, which is almost always another human close to us taken away by death. The person  who  we miss most, brought back to us  in flesh and blood, perfect in everyway we imagined them to be. It seems almost  like a dream come true as a possibility , but the moment a human is put in the situation it feels like the materialization of a nightmare. The entire movie is about the way different crew members within the ship responds to this, almost like the way characters in bergman's  sevent seal confronts and responds to the materialization of  death. Once we get past the initial fear of the materialization, what happens next is a desperate urge to protect it, to realise whatever it is that we regret by losing them an turning life back to the way it was supposed to be. And then just as we start finding joy in the illusion we grow conscious about the nature  materialisation; it can never be the person that has been lost to us. Because whatever has been created is just an image of the person, everything that we know about a person and this draws a parallel to the way human reationship works in the real world- we never actually understands a person in true sense. The film explores the limit of human empathy like no other at this point, how well could you know or empathise even the person whom you love  most in this world. Could we ever really  know what or how another person feels at any point  of our lives? All we does is imagine us in their position and think how we may have felt if we were them and all that we know about a person is in real whatever we want to see in them.  The question of the others  the movie poses to us at this point is revelatory enough  to drive us paranoid on knowledge of the self and therein lies the genius of the film.  The film starts by questioning what we know about everything beyond our self and ends by confirming our  hopelessness in the knowledge of the self. \n\nSoderberg has always been a director who explores  the more styistic aspects of storytelling in cinema and I have always felt he would have been acknowledged a greater filmmaker had he belonged to another generation like the new wave where style was accepted as the content.But this one like many great masterpieces has  confirms the notion that storytelling indiscernibly aiding the story is what makes a movie truly great. There are moments in with the present juxtaposed with the past again justaposed with fantasy, all so carefully wrapped up by clever editing where  the whole sequence goes brings out meaning beyond the sum of the images. Soderberds choice of images, the detached quality of the visuals and the music all places the viewer in a meditative state  but the movie at the same time is  very legible, uncompromising and committed to the storytelling that one doesn\u00e2(TM)t need to be a very committed cinephile to be seduced by it. I think it\u00e2(TM)s a masterpiece without doubt,though imdb rating disagrees with me.",

The movie starts off when George Clooney as Chris Kelvin has just lost his wife, Natascha McElhone as Rheya and is in the stages of getting over it.  He receives a message from old associates about an assignment of being sent to a space station orbiting close to a planet called Solaris!  Within' an hour later and seeing illusions of his wife created by Solaris, we soon learned that the reason she commited suicide was because she was expecting, and Chris wanted this to be discussed with him first before any decisions can be made motivating him to abandon her and upon coming back to see her, she was already dead, taking her own life!  \r\n\r\n  As radical as Soderburg wanted to become, he decides to take liberty and somehow change the ending into the beginning.  Assuming that theirs a rotation happening!  After director Soderburgh made successes out of remaking Traffick from the UK mini-series Traffik, and of course Ocean's 11, it'd make sense to him attempting to do this again. By watching this, you can tell Clooney had a say in this film too, since he doesn't advocate any children in his personal life including marriage.  And I knew I didn't like this movie, but I couldn't figure out why this is nothing more than a poor cheap reproduction of the 1972 original, whereas the movie assumes viewers are well aware about \"Solaris's\" functions way before Chris accepted this kind of mission, it was never properly explained about Solaris's capabilities until his illusioned wife became appearent, with viewers asking more questions than viewers receiving answers, such as \"What is Solaris's main intention?\" or \"Is he ever sorry for leaving Rheya in an extremely delicate situation?\", and the other question, \"Is Chris's decision to remain on the Space Station, was that to justify his actions before Rheya took her own life\".  It was those questions as well as more that have viewers scratching their heads, and not worth going to the movies for, rather looking like a tv movie special than anything!  \r\n\r\n2 out of 4",

Kelvin is a psychologist who is sent to investigate the crew on a spaceship that is researching the planet Solaris. But when he arrives he discovers that most of the crew have killed themselves. The cause of their torment is unknown, but Kelvin is about to find out when his dead lover mysteriously appears infront of him, alive and well. The only significant difference in THIS Solaris is that we get a glims into Kelvin's world and his developing and failing relationship with his girlfriend. We actually see him in  the city and futuristic world, and we get to see the real problem in his personal life. But it's not as much as interesting as it is an explaination for the series of events and emotions. Other than that, we are given the same material the original had already covered. But where the original thoroughly examined it's themes in the 165 minute running time, this 100 minute movie only briefly gives us the right themes and emotions were supposed to get from the story.\r\n\r\nIf there's anyone who could capture the thoughtful but slow pace of Andrey Tarkovskiy it's Steven Soderbergh. Don't get me wrong, I love Soderbergh, and he captures the mood of the story quite well. The slow pace, the sense of depression and isolation, the mystery and psychological horror, all of it is there. But I guess my problem is that as slow and depressing this movie is, which is still very unconventional to other Hollywood movies, Andrey Tarkovskiy's version is a lot more slower, more isolated and depressing, and frankly, the scenes make a lot more sense and have more purpose. Where Tarkovskiy's Solaris had scenes of great symbolism and meaning, the only meaning to the shots in this movie are how cool the animation looks and how depressing Kelvin's life is. The 1972 movie had a lot more meaning. But other than the comparison, this movie does look quite stunning. The spaceship looks a lot more realistic as a spaceship than the original, and I REALLY LOVE the look of the futuristic society. The little changes in technology, and what remains the same today is a great mix of sci-fi and a natural and realistic feel. And trying not to compare the two movies, the directing and cinematography is fantastic as always from Soderbergh.\r\n\r\nIf one never seen the original 1972 Solaris, then they would find this movie very creative and thought provoking. Hell, maybe they would prefer this version because of the aquired taste it takes to sit through the '72 Solaris. But for me, and on a professional level, what this Solaris tries to say and get across, the original did a lot more clearly and effectively. And due to the lack of originality in this movie, I have to deduct points.",

She's not human!\"\r\n  On the subject of Solaris itself, his friend Gibarian (who's been in the morgue the whole time) comes to him in a dream and chips in with \"why does it have to want anything?\". We're used to aliens either wanting to befriend us or obliterate us, always in a basically humanoid form  - this is a \"what if\" with a much more intellectual and cerebral \"take\" on the possibilities, crossed with a gone-wrong love story which is finally resolved in a 2001-style series of godlike interventions by the planet. \r\nCliff Martinez's bleakly beautiful electronic soundtrack heightens the atmosphere and complements the experience of a film that isn't a barrel of laughs, but isn't meant to be - it's about the underpinnings of the forces that draw us together as humans, and the consequences that arise from them.",

I'd give it 2, a limbo I mostly reserve for typical American films and Adam Sandler, but maybe it's the source material that bumped it up a notch. \n\nIf this film is indeed a direct retelling of either the previous film or the novel, I may be in for some more hurt. But I really think it's Soderbergh's fault. I've never been a fan and now I'm nervous and reluctant about watching Che that I just got on Criterion. Overall, another factor of bumping it up half as star is at least the style. I get where it was trying to go and accomplish. The end product even gives you a somewhat surreal feeling but nothing to really back it up. Maybe that was in due part to the score which was great at first but then really fell to feeling repetitive. I loved the look at least for some parts. The space station was a little dull, too silver and \"look at me it's the future!\" for my tastes. Almost like a studio driven copy cat wannabe poor man's 2001, if that makes sense. \n\nI expected somewhat more from this and was disappointed; I was as disillusioned as the Space-People.\n\nAnd why does James Cameron need 3 assistants if he's just a producer? I suppose assisting him in doing nothing isn't as bad as paying him an offensive amount of money to do nothing. Cameron knows Sci-Fi like Soderbergh knows how to make me care about this movie and what's going on, in a world where the only expression people know to show on their face is confusion. \n\nBut at least I made some popcorn to occupy my time during this one.",

When he finally decides to go, he discovers amazing and terrifying things are taking place that will challenge his own madness. I did like this movie, although the pace was something to be reconsidered. I believe this role was a huge platform for Clooney who has had many more unique and interesting oppurtunities become available for him after this. I am very glad I gave this movie a chance and I think if you want a good psychological science fiction flick that will change your outlook and perception of who your \"visitor\" might be, then definitely check out 'Solaris'.",

He brings realism and a naturalistic quality to the role which not many \"unexperienced\" actors would have been able to bring. Also the leading man behind the camera does a great job in both the script and the directing. The slow takes and slow pacing of the movie helps build tension and drag out each scene so you are not allowed to leave your seat as there is no action codes which tell you when something big is going to happen. Soderbough also makes the film look beautiful with a blend of dark and technoligical cinematography which beautifully contrasts the bright natural feel you get from Solaris which is just outside their windows. The way \"Solaris\" is shot as well is interesting in itself as the angles which Soderbough uses are original and sometimes make you believe you are seeing something you arn't which is a representation of one of the main themes of \"seeing is not believing\".",

However, what is unexpected about this film is its depth and philosophical rigour. Stanislav Lem's 1961 novel Solaris is heavy reading; one would think that transcription of this book into film would inevitably fall prey to either a self-important look-at-me-ain't-I-deep charade or a pronounced lack of ambition, which is so painfully manifest in Tarkovsky's 1972 version.

In some respects it is hard to conclude what Lem had in mind, but it is clear that Soderbergh didnt grasp any of the main points of the book.\nThis is sci-fi piffle at its finest. Soderbergh it seems wanted to capture the more hard-core science fiction feel of 2001, but fails because he really didnt get the original story (or science it seems), and what he provided was a confused misinterpretation, which essentially contradicts the central ideas of the book...\n\nAll of the science of Solaris (the book) has been removed!!!\nAll reference to the planet is gone (you see more of Clooneys naked ass)....and with it the main premise of the story: do we know as much we  think we do, and can we really explore and understand the unknown in the universe, given how little we truly know of ourselves?\n\nWhile Lem repeatedly references the human tendency to anthropomorphise the unknown and the dangers in doing so, all Soderbergh really does is cash in on such concepts. While Lem suggests Solaris seems to tap into the vast unconscious aspect of the human psyche (whether deliberately or accidentally), Soderbergh avoids all question about the operation and motivations and Solaris, and uses it simply as a vehicle to create a bizarre lovestory, as if Solaris has the ability to fulfill Kelvin's unrequited desires (and as a result by implication that it 'consciously' understands these desires).\n\nWhile Lem tries to explain as much as he can about how the visitors operate, Soderbergh cherry picks their behaviours even allowing allowing them to remember events that could not be part of the memory of the person from whose memories they have been created....\n\nWhile Lem suggests the visitors are derived from the crews' deepest and most clearly defined memories, and consequently emanate from the darkest imaginings or events of a persons life, which the individuals then have to face, Soderbergh even goes so far as to have one visitor be the double of the crewman, just to have a twist near the end!\n\nWhile Lem uses Solaris to show human naivety in exploration, and discusses at length the course of scientific exploration, and provides a very strong sense of isolation, danger and alienation regarding Solaris, Soderbergh provides a cosy comfortable, ordered structured environment, essentially the opposite of what Lem had described.\n\nWhile Lem creates characters on the verge of breakdown struglling to come to terms with Solaris, and incapable of communciating, Soderbergh gives us the standard American group therapy where everyone is oh so happy to share at every juncture...\n\n\nWhile Solaris the book should make you think, Solaris the movie is a major yawnfest!!\n\nOk, so the book would be hard to make into a decent movie, and ok so Soderbergh decided to make a lovestory...but he didnt have to gut such a Science Fiction classic in such a witless manner to do so!\n\nIf you watched the movie and enjoyed it, great!

Both the space station and Earth city settings are highly un-natural and depressing, adding to the tone of the film.  There is nothing natural, safe or warm in this film other than aspects of the characters, giving a very narrow focus and delivering this well.\r\n\r\nComparisons to Tarkovsky's older version of Solaris are inevitable.  However, both are very different films that happen to use the same novel as their foundation.  Tarkovsky's much longer film explores human love fully - not just romantic love - and our wider humanity.  In doing so, it contrasts the artificial station (and cities) with natural landscapes, resulting in an altogether different film.\r\n\r\nIn short, both versions of Solaris are excellent films in their own right, with different emphases.",

            "content": "I must commend producer James Cameron, director Steven Soderbergh, and all the people that committed to making a movie such as this, when they must have known very well that its commercial appeal would be very limited and thus risked being labeled \"a failure\".\r\n\r\nThe viewer will be required to sublimate to the mood and pay attention to more subtle hints than an audience is used to being given. This still exists as a factor even though I felt it did much more explaining than the Tarkovsky picture. \r\n\r\nYou would also have to be predisposed towards material of this nature, which perhaps would be better called \"psych fiction\" in place of \"science fiction.\"\r\n\r\nRegardless, as Cameron says on one of the DVDs special features, the idea is that the source material is more akin to science fiction of \"the 50s and 60s\" with 'ideas and human stories more than ray-guns and robots'. \r\n\r\nA lot of people will find this boring and slow. A lot of people will concentrate on a love story and think it centrally important when it really is up to the viewer to interpret for oneself what is most important to take away from it. \r\n\r\nTo me the \"love story\", if it can truly be called that given the circumstances of self-delusion, incomplete memory manifested as a living being by an unknown force and questioned as hallucinatory or \"not human\", or the consideration that any love may be considered debased in self-delusional self-pity. \r\n\r\nTo look at the picture and merely cast it off as a fearful compromise made by originally brave filmmakers who felt commercial pressure to subvert it to a \"love story in space\" is to denigrate the risks inherent in filming this in the first place. I much more appreciative of the commercial sacrifice, even if original story author Stanislaw Lem takes the attitude depicted. It should also be noted he hates the 1972 work as well. \r\n\r\nhttp://english.lem.pl/arround-lem/adaptations/soderbergh/147-the-solaris-station\r\n\r\nAt that link you can read the author's opinions on the film adaptation.\r\n\r\nAgain, it really comes down to your disposition towards film. If you feel you are patient to allow ideas develop, have a bit of a sci-fi geek inside of you, and appreciate artistic integrity even if it should sacrifice conventional pacing, then you may like this film as I do.\r\n\r\nIf you are more of a type that wants the story to be fully explained, has little patience for psychodrama, and no interest in any imaginings of alternate life forms or their potential communications, then you would likely hate this movie. \r\n\r\nNow, in contrast to the Tarkovsky effort, I did find the building feeling of palpable tension to be diminished in the Soderbergh treatment. It does emphasize feelings of regret, self-loathing, and redemption in loving more so than I felt the 70s version does. While I feel Tarkovsky brought more attention to Solaris as an entity, the modern effects of Soderbergh's time make it look more beautiful. It should be noted that no film did treat Solaris itself with the respect Lem intended. \r\n\r\nI had the benefit of foresight when watching the Soderbergh film that I didn't have when I watched Tarkovsky's, so I must hesitate to claim which I felt did a better job of treating the alien intelligence. Soderbergh seemed to emphasize the feeling that there weren't any solutions, and that humanity wasn't looking for other worlds as much searching for mirrors to itself. It can be argued that these mentions are so briefly touched upon that they are rendered to window dressing status and can be ignored, but I would say this is where your disposition comes in. If it is there, then it can be considered, and in this method of explaining more through telling it can't be denied.\r\n\r\nNow I intend to seek out the book to see what author Lem is going on about. It must be difficult to be an author whose work is adapted by others in ways he finds denigration of his original intent and ideas, but it also may be improved as a whole for other artists to make their representation. I have a feeling that the cliche of book's superiority over film to develop ideas may win out. \r\n\r\nFor I am most interested in the nature of Solaris itself. This is the captivating idea. The human experience exists to help us identify what it might be by how it contrasts from the essence of us.",

This film is the quintessential science-fiction film, making us look at our very existence and our place in reality with different eyes.

The first time I saw it was back when it first came out on DVD. I thought it was slow and pointless and unemotional. I recently re-watched it and thought that the first half was amazing and the second half was absolute garbage. I then re-watched the second half and finally understood why it was a masterpiece and why the ending is absolute perfection, even if it's very hard to piece together exactly what's happening at first. The relationship between the doctor (a top-of-his-game George Clooney) and his dead wife (Natasha McElhone -- the weakest performer in the film) is actually not as compelling as I would have liked or would have expected, but they are not the real core interest of the film anyway. The real character of interest is Solaris, the strange planet that has caused inexplicable things to \"happen\" to crew members aboard the spaceship that orbits it. Solaris is a fascinating character, a complex god, a demon, a simultaneously benevolent and malevolent force with possessive intentions. It can't be fully rationalized because we aren't meant to understand it's scope of power or its ultimate goals, but it's always there; always lurking in the minds of our human protagonists, always making something \"happen.\" Solaris is an absolutely stunning film, beautifully shot with an exceptional score and a haunting tone. It took me 2.5 times to appreciate it, but now that I do, I'm sure Solaris will draw me in for more.",

This is why this movie is so great.  It shows how different people react to something so \"crazy\".  Clooney gives a heartbreaking performance as a man who has his \"wife\" back.

Chris learns that his trip is sanctioned by the space program as a security force had been sent to the station to investigate, that security team which is now missing. When Chris arrives at the station, he finds only two surviving team members, Drs. Gordon and Snow (Dr. Gibarian committed suicide), who are both acting nervously. Chris also finds two unexpected people there, the first, who Chris only sees fleetingly, being Dr. Gibarian's adolescent son Michael, and the second being Chris' deceased wife, Rheya. Chris and Rheya had a passionate relationship in all its good and bad before she committed suicide. Apparently, these appearances of loved ones of the crew at the station are what Chris has come to investigate. As Chris, Gordon and Snow discuss and argue about what to do, Chris becomes emotionally invested in this vision of his wife, who herself begins to realize she looks like Rheya, acts like Rheya (including having the same feelings for Chris), answers to the name Rheya, but is not really the Rheya that was once Chris' wife.",

I beg to differ, although regretably I haven't read the book and or watched the first film adaptation, so I'm not sure how much more superior in terms of craft or entertainment they might be. On its own, I find this is much more enjoyable if viewed for its own merits, which include Soderbergh's pretty, focused and experimental direction and a solid lead performance from his frequent collaborator George Clooney, as well as a stellar supporting performance from Jeremy Davies (of \"Saving Private Ryan\" fame). In the end, it's more interesting than entertaining, more idea-provoking than narratively challenging, and more fun discussing than watching, but it's rare to see such an emotionally and philosophically driven science fiction movie with this kind of polish produced by a major studio in the last decade. At the time, Soderbergh was on a big role, so I'm sure his involvement let this most unorthodox flick slip by, as well as help from producer James Cameron, who keeps his more showy and macho style on the sideline and seems to have only influenced the film through some sparringly used special FX. It's more comparable to something like \"The Fountain\" than other big budget sci-fi films, and so if you fall into the category of viewers who like weird, ambitious stories that are purely symbolic instead of by-the-numbers mainstream fare, this should be quite satisfying.",

Personally I consider this movie to be an insightful love story with the milieu of Science as the platform. This definitely requires attention to value the context.\r\n\r\nThe story begins with the central character Chris (George Clooney), a psychiatrist distressed by the loss of his wife Rheya (Natascha McElhone). Shortly a call from his friend/scientist lands him on a space station to a far of planet called Solaris, to investigate some bizarre occurrences which led to death and disappearance of some crew members. The story begins when Chris starts seeing his deceased wife onto the research station and tries to correlate the situation along with delusion. \r\n\r\nI think appreciation should go to Soderbergh for choosing the cast so effectively, who had morphed into the characters through a seamless transition. The chemistry between the two key characters is what made the movie so enjoyable. I think Jeremy Davies also pulled up his part pretty much well. Soundtrack used had some kind of appeal which is very hard to put across in words. Presence of James Cameron as Producer also refined the overall quality of the movie, especially if I emphasis on the production set and the special effects deployed.\r\n\r\nThis is a movie which will not appeal to the universal viewers but to those who have loved movies like 2001: A Space Odyssey as well as 2009\u0092s Moon. Again that\u0092s my perception; choice is definitely for individuals to make.",

            "content": "\u0093How far will you go for a second chance?\u0094 is the question that Steven Soderbergh\u0092s latest film Solaris pursues. The plot centers on psychologist Chris Kelvin (Clooney), who is sent as a last ditch effort to recover any survivors on a space station that is orbiting and studying the planet Solaris. \r\n\r\nKelvin arrives to find the commander mysteriously dead, another crewman missing, and two survivors that will not talk about what has happened. Snow (Jeremy Davies, Daniel Farady in \"Lost\") talks in circles (\u0093I could tell you what happened, but you won\u0092t understand until it happens to you. So there\u0092s no point in telling you.\u0094), while Gordon (TV actress Viola Davis) will not come out of her room. \r\n\r\nKelvin soon experiences what the others did when he wakes up next to his wife (McElhone) who has been dead for several years. However, time has not passed for her, and Kelvin has to revisit painful memories to make sense of what is reality and what is not.\r\n\r\nExecutive produced by James Cameron and based off the novel by Stanislaw Lem, Solaris is a good comeback from Soderbergh\u0092s fiasco Full Frontal. It was beautifully filmed by Soderbergh himself (under his pseudonym Peter Andrews) with subtle overall tints of blue. The visual effects of the planet itself are simple but fabulous all the same. Every shot is long and very slow-moving, but that is not to say they are boring in any way. The pace of the film itself (as well as the characters in it) moves along in way that is never hurried, yet it is intense enough to keep the viewer anxious for the next scene.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is not the visuals, but the sound (or quite frankly, the lack thereof) of the film that give Solaris its amazing sense of atmosphere. This is without a doubt one of the quietest movies Hollywood has produced. The lack of noise and sound effects in this film is much more effective than the usual explosions and roars that would be typical in other sci-fi films. \r\n \r\nUltimately where Solaris succeeds is the emotional (rather than physical) intensity it radiates. The characters, more often than not, are looking directly into the camera when speaking - a technique usually avoided by most directors because it greatly increases the intimacy between the character and the viewer. The only thing the film suffers from is the surprisingly poor acting by the entire cast except Clooney, who is marvelous in this film.\r\n\r\nThe film was initially rated R due to two scenes of Clooney\u0092s nude rear end, but Soderbergh was able to argue the MPAA down to a PG-13. This is a very enjoyable sci-fi film as long as the viewer is prepared for drama rather than action and thrills.",

Clooney has never been better with Natascha McElhone shining every bit as brightly in a very challenging role. The film is aesthetically whole with amazing cinematography, eerily beautiful music and visionary directing; it challenges, enchants and forces you into thinking. It's not as political as Tarkovski's classic, but it's more relevant on a psychological and philosophical level. It's universal and captures something very unique and essential about what humanity is, about what life is or could be.\n\nHere's an example of how science fiction should be made in my opinion. Reaching for something new while mirroring our very existence. It's just very sad to note that this movie, like so many intelligent, true sci-fi films was a clear financial failure.

The cinematography is bland (it looks like one of those commercials that try to look like a film), the music is straight out of a b video game, the acting sucked and everything was spelled out the viewer.\n\nSoderbergh tries to have poetic moments in his film (with montages that juxtapose past and present with reality) but they come off as obvious and cliche. In fact the movie wants to be something that is new and fresh, but is ultimately nothing more than convention. \n\nOn the plus, Natascha McElhone is hot.

The movie requires you to make up the story as the movie goes on while the movie in no idea tries to inform you of what the hell.  Clooney is portrayed as a smart character in the beginning of the movie but becomes super weak towards the middle.

Even the flashbacks were boring and just didn't even flow well.  It did get me thinking of how life would be if we had to experience Solaris but truly that's the book's idea.  Not even the movie,  I liked how the movie tried to create some connection with its audience but did anyone even understand what's going on?  I felt the film tried to be too artsy for it's own good.  What makes everything worse is that end and the whole heaven crap was just disappointing.\n\nWould I recommend this film?

I don't see how people would fault this American version for being different from the Russian, since neither captures even half of the thematic focus of the novel, which undoubtably is infinitely better than any other form of the story. The novel manages to study the relationship between parallel topics of an introspective, psychological love story and a philosophical exploration on the limits of scientific understanding, subjectivity, practical implications of religion, etc. (the whole boat-load). The Russian film focused on the latter, while, as might be expected, the American went for the former. So I can't really see how anyone says they appreciate the book in its entirety, praise the 1972 film but dismiss the 2002 one. So all that aside, this film does its niche fairly well. The cinematography, soundtrack, acting, writing are all fairly above par if not spell-binding (the acting is really far more compelling here than in the Russian; those who say otherwise are just being stubborn). The pace is slow which can definitely turn off a lot of people, but it provides a dream-like, Lynchian trance for those who sit the whole thing out.",

On pretty much every front, Solaris is an exceptional film. George Clooney is marvelous here. My main criticism with him, as much as I do like him, is that he frequently seems to just play himself in many films. Here, however, he does anything but. Steven Soderbergh's direction is great and the visual effects here of space and of the planet Solaris are breathtakingly gorgeous and really something to marvel at. In that way and in terms of what it all means, reminds me a lot of 2001: A Space Odyssey. Very ambigious, confusing, slow, and beautiful, Solaris is really quite brilliant, though a tough nut to crack. Personally, I am still racking my brain over what everything in this one meant and trying to figure out what I am supposed to take away. Ultimately, however, I think this is an orange you can peel in many different ways, which makes it all the more intriguing. Personally, I think there are many plausible explanations, whether they be on reality (what is truly real?), love (and its everlasting nature), and death (where will we reunite, if we ever do? letting go or can you truly ever let go?). It raises many interesting questions and it may not have all the answers and is most certainly very flawed at times and leaves many unanswerable questions (unless \"I don't know\" is an answer). However, in spite of that, I adored this one. I love films with ambiguity and ones that raise many questions that make it fun to discuss and this is a classic example of that. Now, I would never recommend it to anyone, because if I did, odds are they would come back and call me an idiot since this one is an acquired taste, but I loved it all the same.",

I say that as it has a definite mysterious feel to it from the outset, with the viewer not getting much in the way of insight into whats going on but the more we see, the more intriguing and complicated things may appear. George Clooney does well in his role as a psychologist and I thought it was quite atmospheric, with a real looming sense/feel to it and believable people acting erratically while on board the isolated research station in space. Its a bit of a slow burner of a film but its certainly not a bad one. I liked that the background music/sound effects weren't too loud and 'in your face' and I thought the dialogue was quite good at times, although it can't be said that there's constant dialogue as some times scenes pass without long and convoluted discussions. One thing I found a little frustrating was that in some scenes, the dialogue was quite quiet, with characters talking in hushed tones - this may be an issue for people who are hard of hearing. This film has a somewhat philosophical side to it, which I quite liked. The focus on a lack of memory intrigued me. Also, some scenes feature relatively shaky/jerky camerawork, which might frustrate some viewers.This is definitely more of an arty/'deep' philosophical film than anything else and so it may seem a bit pretentious to some but in any case, overall; yes, I would recommend this film as I personally found myself pretty engrossed in it.",
